1609611543|3.0|I guess it works after a while but I can't imagine not eating any bread.It did get a little boring at times so I put it down for a while and will finish it later.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|this game is an awesome strategy/turn based game you'll probably love this game. This game combines trading and the Sci-fi into an awesome mix
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great from every perspective. Imagine yourself as a parent dealing with this situation. Mystery, psychological thriller . . . can't put it down.
B002LFPAUC|4.0|Good stuff..<br /> I enjoyed this very much... tooo funny.. Great fun to be seen by anyone who can appreciate<br />British comedy
B007JMW46U|5.0|Holmes not only solves complex crimes but by explaining his thought process to Watson, gives us insight into his logic.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|You will like Lark Rise to Candleford.  We checked the series out using our Amazon Prime and immediately added to our watch list.  Just finished season 1 and starting on the next season.  We started watching to fill our need for more Downton Abbey but has become a favorite on it's own.<br />Highly recommend checking it out.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|An intriguing story, gently caressing the characters with some surprising turns which put them out of their comfort zone.  It is warm hearted, caring and a treasure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was surprised when I opened the app. I thought it would be a stupid knockoff of minecraft but it was not. The only suggestion I have is make a village for us Mojang!
0756655307|5.0|My boyfriend and I are both huge marvel fans. I bought him this book for Christmas. He was super surprised and we both love looking thought it.
B005LUJWMG|5.0|This, being a Ken Follett book, was unputdownable.  Marvelous storyteller.  Never disappoints.  Easy to tell I'm a huge fan of his books - and others like them though, sadly, there aren't many.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|My heart was in my mouth for much of the story, as we follow Pi through his life and meaning.  The twist at the end was unexpected and made me want to re-read the book, and see the movie.  I will never forget this story.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I got this cable as a solution to the problem that I was having with my Kindle Fire (first generation) the wall adapter that came with it was loose and my Kindle would not charge. Customer Service suggested this charger and all of my charging issues have been resolved. I also got the adapter that makes this capable of plugging into the wall. I am very happy with this product.
6304178352|5.0|Great service.  Timely mailed and timely received.<br />Adequately packaged.  Reasonably priced.<br />blah - blah - blah - blah - blah - blah -  I didn't want<br />to say anymore, than what I said but more words<br />were required before the submission was processed.<br />Anyway - good job - I will order again!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers World Tour (Sydney) is a really cool, fun, and actually kind of addicting app! I really like it and play it all the time. My goal is to unlock every single thing, boards, people, whatever! And, yes, that includes upgrades. I recommend this app to, well, everyone! It's a winner.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|If bejeweled is what you're looking for, this is your app. Very similar. Nice bright colors and increasing challenges per level.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci is a fantastic author and 'The Innocent&#34; is one of his very best. You are almost compelled to turn the page you are so eager to find out what's coming next. I thought the book 'fantastic. I have been a real 'fan' of his since I read his first book. and only the date has changed since.
0307165485|5.0|This is a great book.  My children had it when they were children and they wanted it for their children. Gread memories.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It's gr8.It lets you do things that we can't usually do.Its a pleasure to have. I have fun with this app.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is soo awesome . if your looking at this game and don't know if you should get it just get it . there are so many dragons you can get and grow. and you can grow your dragons huge. so get the game trust me its worth it
B0063IH60K|1.0|Graphics is ugly and flat, gameplay is quite boring and ordinary. Too many ads, they don't let you play normally. I would recommend everyone to find better solitaire game.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|but as I got about 50% through the book things took off.  I was not able to guess the outcome as l usually do in most stories, this one caught me by surprise and a pleasant, thought provoking one at that.<br />I will agree that the first half of the book \\"seemed\\" disjointed at first and had me wondering \\"what the hell is going on?\\", however, as you read, questions are answered, and the character development will surprise you.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Our whole family enjoys this movie.  My daughter was particularly thrilled to get it for a gift on Easter.  OK?
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can't even begin to wrap my mind around this book. What a beautifully, dark and twisted story.  Took me on a journey I truly was not expecting.  Perfection.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|Can't use it. Very uncomfortable, bad app. Better use drop box, but not this. Glitch and unstable, I could not even start it.
B009S33I68|5.0|It gives you the feeling you were there with the soldiers in battle.  Great book.  Would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Viet Nam war.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife & I are hooked.  What else can I say.  The character development in the first two seasons keeps you interested.
0887307280|1.0|I do not understand why this book seems to have the impact it did on the small business world.  While Gerber does present an intersting and inciteful idea that many businesses fail because there is lack of proper balance between the tecnician, the manager and the entrepreneur, he then goes away from this theme and recommends that all new companies should have a process that is detailed enough so your comapny can run without you.  He continues to emphasise and recommend this franchise type of business model.  He suggests that this will allow a new owner to hire those with no expertise in the product and to rely on the process itself to run the business. While franchises certainly offer a valid business model, to promote this way of business simply as a way to avoid the need to find and hire employees and managers with knowledge of your industry is simply ludicrous.<br /><br />He continues to return to a ficticious dialogue between him and a small business owner that i found simpy unrealistic and downright insulting. The impropper use of quotation marks as well as the capitalization of The Technician, The Manager and The Entrepreneur were quite annoying as well.  His editor(s) must have been those who were following an &#34;operations manual&#34; and had no experience in editing a book.<br /><br />I also question the length.  Most paragraphs in the book were one sentence long.  That, along with a painful repetative style led me to believe he was stretching it out as far as he could.<br /><br />All in all, he makes a few good observations in the first 50 or so pages; after that, a complete waste of time. I would not recommend this book.
0316023744|4.0|Nothing is more irritating than these reviews and then tell me I need more words and now I need to add more.
034580404X|5.0|I have these books on my iPad....and read them twice now. Last week I wanted to reread book three and my iPad did or work.....so I just purchased the paperbacks. I am madly in love with Christian and Ana's romance. How beautiful to be so madly and passionately in love. I will keep these books close to my heart forever.

B00C391Y3I|5.0|I have seen them live in NYC in 1991 during the farewell tour under originalblend. Decades passes and saw them at the launchin stage in Katowice in Poland April last year. The party was great. I enjoyed like in 1991. Nothing to say. Few changes came over the body and he seems anymore...
1449410243|5.0|This will make you think twice about what Mr. Meow is up to... Seriously, if you have a cat lover in your midst gift them this book. It's hilarious! I got it as a gift and it's a fun, fantastic, read! I took the poster from the book to work and everyone stops by and reads it, and points out what their cat does.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very addictive . It is fun and challenging at some points . Sometimes it is tempting to by coins, invest points, and energy.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|Can't wait for Season 6! Season 5 was just as awesome! A must see. It is addictive, you will love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading the countless positive reviews on Amazon, I thought for sure that the praise of the books had to be exaggerated.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. The storytelling here completely fantastic, I smashed through the entire series of books in a little more then a week and I'm not even a fan of science fiction.<br /><br />looking forward to the rest that follow and you should too!
1455502758|4.0|Hitchens' last tome treats his impending death and battle with cancer in a very straightforward, no-nonsense light. His experiences and thoughts are well-formed and without rancor or self-pity. Nor is there a lot of woe and 'alas alack' in tone or topic. Perhaps his most heartfelt and touching writing, this would be a great book for any cancer patient, survivor, or loved one.
B000S88JTS|5.0|This is the best motorcycling movie. Bruce Brown did for motorcycling what Warren Miller does for skiing. It will make you want to get on your bike and ride!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I've been using this app for a couple weeks...and love it. I prefer the computer version over the phone and kindle app. But I'm sure I'll like it more once I get used to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really good and fun and if you get bored then this os the game you should get.<br />I loved playing this game and to me it is really fun and it never gets boring and when I played I always get new high scores
B005HSL626|3.0|I like the Fruit Ninja game, but the popups are over the top.  I would not mind some ads, but between every 2 minute game is a bit much.  Every game has ads to join something or to get another game.  It's makes the game not worth playing.
0525952926|5.0|I always like Follett. Anxiously waiting for his third Trilogy  Book. I have read almost all of his books. He is a great author.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Even though this book was written for young adults, I found it captivating. I could not put it down. Suzanne Collins is a wonderfully descriptive writer that makes the characters come alive.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It was just as good as seeing it in movie theaters. Amazing! The 3D effects are the best! Highly recommend it.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I hate these books as much as I love them.  They go on and on and say nothing  An interesting, well loved character to me equals great reading, a character I don't like means pushing my way through many tedious pages of boredom.  Martin is an OK writer but if he was a good writer the books could be half as long and say much more.  I don't understand why people think these books are great as they are simply tedious and at times very boring.  Don't waste your time trying to read this sluggish mess of words
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I have watched this movie on several occasions in the past . I didn't know it was available on DVD, needless to say, as soon a I found it on Amazon, I ordered it !
B00947N6UG|4.0|Loved this movie. Great for children and great for the little kid living inside all of us. Really an instant classic.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a lovable character. Here is Life narrowed down to it's most desparate and then expanded to the best in human nature and philosophy.
B005LAII8A|5.0|This is what I said upon originally watching the film when it came out theatrically:<br /><br />Last night, I saw Looper. And then, this morning, I saw it again. I loved it the first time, and it was even better on the second viewing. It’s confident, charming, surprising, fun, smart, incredibly tightly plotted (despite a premise which may or may not be a bit flimsy, and which sort of begs for every sf nerd on the internet to tear it apart—a concern the film itself actually addresses at a couple of points); it’s incredibly well-acted, and, not that it’s a surprise coming from Rian Johnson, absolutely fantastically directed. It was an utterly fulfilling movie-going experience, and I can easily see Looper taking the top spot in my year-end best of list. (The other contender, The Master, was wonderful as well, a truly Great with-a-capital-G film, but left me wanting—which may very well have been by design, but it lacked closure all the same; Looper, on the other hand, challenges you and can be fairly cerebral at points, but it’s wholly satisfying.)<br /><br />I have a lot of thoughts on Looper, from how time travel basically functioned the same way it does in the Back to the Future trilogy, to how great the performances were, to how deeply unsettled I was by a particular scene, but for now I’ll just say that it’s without a doubt the best genre piece I’ve seen this year, and one of the best films overall as well.<br /><br />What I will add now: upon a million subsequent viewings, it's still great.
0385349947|5.0|I have three important things to say about this book. (1) Our generation was indeed naive, and she's a good historian. Sheryl's description of what it was like in 1987 when she graduated from high school and 1991 when she graduated from college was so exactly right I could have written it myself.  I am precisely the same age and vintage; I grew up in NC and went to a Southern public high school, then managed to go on to the Ivy League like Sheryl. I relate to her complete obliviousness at 18 about differences between men and women's futures, to her shock as a college freshman when others were so much better prepared (that need-to-catch-up accounts for some of my own ambition and probably hers, too). And I definitely relate to the wide-eyed realization 10-20 years after college that most of my female classmates were opting out. (2) Sheryl did not need to write this book.  It won't help her career at Facebook; in fact, it is probably a huge distraction right now.  My favorite line in the book is where she says \\"This is me leaning in. Writing this book is what I would do if I weren't afraid.\\"  She's willing herself not to be afraid of the criticism. She's worked up her nerve to not care if investors and board members disapprove of how she is spending her time, because she knows she can still keep her eye on the ball at Facebook. She grit her teeth to share all those personal anecdotes she cringes over, because she knows you like reading them. She never wanted to write a book but felt compelled to, to help other women. I really believe that is her aim, and the money she'll make from this book is nothing compared to the satisfaction of positively influencing other women.  I can relate to this as well, as I too felt compelled to write a book for businesswomen (Smart Women and Small Business, 2006), largely because I also observed the ambition and confidence gap and discomfort with money and business among women. I too wanted to encourage them to find a way to balance workand family. I'm not famous, and writing and promoting my book left me no better off financially, but I felt I had to do it. It was \\"in me.\\"  (3) the third thing I want to say about this book is that it shouldn't just apply to the United States.  I live and work abroad, in Hong Kong, and Sheryl's message really resonates here.  We've been working on a movement to get more women onto corporate boards (coincidentally, we launched the 30% Club Hong Kong with the Women's Foundation and the support of 41 Chairmen, mostly men, three days after Lean In came out).  Everyone here is reading Sheryl's book, too, and I've heard no one criticize it.  The lessons Sheryl Sandberg offers up are for the women of the world, and we can make more of a difference if we make her movement global.
B000001GAM|5.0|Giulni's relationship with the VPO, his Italianate grace, his skills and accomplishments as a young musician with violin and viola playing, his experiences with great conductors of this century, his lengthy involvement with Opera and two plus decades with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra yielded a conductor well suited to give this near definitive rendition of Bruckner's 9th.  Lacking in no measure or detail of Bruckner's score, the VPO play willingly and lovingly for Giulni.  In what is typically understood as Bruckner's musical interpretation of \\"farewell to life\\" or such feelings, Giulini has control and tempo to yield fabulous color and symphonic energy.  The gorgeous string plucking of the 2nd movement opening with the plunge into the full orchestral output with the horns and timpani and strings is gorgeous.  This disc belongs in everyone's Bruckner collection.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Plain And Simply Put.......&#34;If Your A Hendrix Fan You Must Get This Album&#34;<br />So Many Of The Songs Reflect Jimis' Roots In Blues Music. I Would Definitely<br />Say This Is A&#34; Must Have&#34; For All Hendrix Fans.<br /><br />ENJOY !
B003QSLW0K|5.0|From my 7 year old: \\"I think it is good and exciting and a good story ...and they're good drawings.\\"<br /><br />From my 4 year old: \\"I think it is great and I was really excited to get it and I really liked it and Stitch really was funny. uhm, it was a great movie and it had a good actors too. And I really liked the songs.\\"<br /><br />Parents: \\"Surprisingly, we really liked it too.\\"
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Although I have read Pride and Prejudice more frequently that Persuasion, I think that this is Jane Austen's best work.  It is a more mature story and has greater depth in her writing.  I would recommend this story to anyone.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I got this app because my blackberry broke and I needed to be able to get up in the morning.  I like the fact that you can set more than one alarm with different sounds to help you get up.  What I don't like is that you have to leave the Kindle on in order for the app to work......sigh, you can't have it all!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good way to pass the time! Animation is pretty good as well. The horses look almost real. I do wish there were more jobs to earn gems within the game.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|At first I admit I was ready to give up on this game!! I just couldn't figure out the right monkeys to get the job done on hard. Its all about playing with different combinations. What works on one level might not work well on others. I did find that once the dart monkeys are fully upgraded and so is attack speed you pretty much coast through most levels. I've had this for a couple months now on both the Kindle and iphone. My only complaint, is that Kindle seems to be very behind on updates with there games. The newest version which includes the engineer monkey and fast track has been out for iPhone for over 3 weeks now. As of today still no update for Kindle. Not acceptable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I hate to pick it up because I can't seem to put it back down. In fact I'm going back right now!
B004LZFWJO|5.0|WOW - I starting playing this game because I like the match up games like Bejeweled....this one is much better!!  You can match diagonally, side-to-side, up, down and all around.  I like the &#34;sweet&#34; when I make a great match!!
B005RJ68HS|5.0|Great sounding vinyl with just enoigh of that vinyl sound.  Loved the 2 tone color, album art to die for
B0000C3I6U|3.0|It was nice to see all the old school bodybuilders from the back in the day but I didn't enjoy it as much as others on here. It was really slow at parts and I wanted to see more of the actually working out then the contests themselves. I plan on watching it again but forwarding through some parts.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Very wordy, so that one is inclined to skim over paragraphs searching for important words which cause one to stop and read.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I like this movie and recommend it because it has action along with humor and holds one in suspense for the entire movie.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very user friendly....so many options and ways to use it.  I love the many translations available! Having the Bible at your fingertips is invaluable.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|The concept is kinda cool but graphically its blah. During the cut scenes it often glitches out. It takes some time to get use to working backwards. You have to leave a scent trail for the mouse to follow to get back to the cheese. At first it easy, but later when there is more obstacles it gets kinda tricky working backwards towards the mouse. Daughter (5) likes it more then I.
B004G6009K|5.0|3D presentation is great! I love the Movie. This package is worth the money. Excellent on Blu-Ray and DVD as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY great game because you can make pretty much anything but I wish they would make you able to mine anything and enchant things.
B0068THAGY|2.0|Poorly developed monster movie. Tries to play the nostalgia card by placing it in the 80s but fails to develop any interesting story lines. Half way through the movie the director just gives up and settles in for a bunch of random explosions to bring the story suspense that it was lacking. Still a fail.
B008KE3960|4.0|Graphically it looks nice and clean. Took me some time before I realized that you really need to set paths for the different type of airplanes to really have a chance. At first I was trying to control all the planes manually and that just does not work when you get farther in the game. I wish there was a different way to set the paths since most of the time you cant get a clean path or you get ripped off on the distance they travel by the time you complete the path for them to take. Overall a good game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok xbox and computer is better but.........this is good to so here is the thing ppl are stupid to rate badly because its only creative right............wrong! tap the word creative it will go to survivor....but why is there no mobs in creative!?
B00BOLE7X0|3.0|Nice portrail of Lincoln, but, I have been reading about him for for 35 years and this movie is just bizzare.  I don't think that Lincoln and the Head of the House were 21st centurary liberals.  But very good production values and acting.  As some other reviewer said ist's Lincoln as a character on the &#34;west wing&#34;.
B008VBYN80|2.0|This game could be good, but is plagued with issues.  There is a guild system that, for some reason, won't let you join other peoples guild only create your own which totally defeats the purpose.  You can unlock troop upgrades, but it requires supplies that you can ask for from friends or buy with diamonds (which cost real money), but friends never get the request so your forced to use diamonds.  I know someone else that plays so I know for a fact it is broken.  Same with buildings.  You can hire people using diamonds or friends, but friends never get the request, and if they ask to fill it themselves you do not get the request.  If issues were fixed this game would be 5 stars.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book looks at current philosophy about health and the healing that doctors do for their patients. Doctors are needed is true but most of what they do is not helping us with our health.<br /><br />This book makes the point that our doctors are only suppressing symptoms. The disease is still progressing despite the suppression of the symptoms.<br /><br />This book also makes the point that we are what we eat and that food can and will be our best medicine.<br /><br />It is a must read!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Let me just start off by saying in my opinion every song on this album is great. The weird thing though is that \\"Sail\\" (which is an amazing song), becomes overshadowed by their less popular stuff the more you listen to the album.<br /><br />Now I also should clarify that I don't really consider \\"My Nightmare's Dream\\" and \\"Some Sort of Creature\\" as songs, especially \\"Some Sort of Creature\\"(literally has no musicality at all), they, I believe, are most likely there just to make the album exactly 1 hour long. Same goes for the oddly long ending of \\"Knights of Shame\\" that is complete silence. This also probably has to do with the lyric \\"Were waiting on a heartbeat, is anybody listening\\" and the silence is symbolic of the \\"waiting\\" because it does eventually play more stuff at the very end of the song that is similar sounding to My Nightmare's Dream and Some Sort of Creature.<br /><br />So great album, however I don't recommend buying it until you hear some other song's by them like \\"Not Your Fault\\" and \\"Kill Your Heroes\\" because these are more indicative of the style, whilst Sail is less so.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Poor viewing. Took longer to watch the first hour of the movie so I turned it off. Got so tired of waiting for it to keep loading I bought it through direct tv.<br /><br />Waste of money.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is a read and read again book.  Hated for it to end, have purchased a soft cover just to share with  my friends.  The characters become very real to the reader.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My almost 4 year absolutely loves this game, as well as Dr. Panda's Restaurant. He could play for hours. I don't think there is much educational about it, but its not mindless like some games. The music isn't annoying yet, but if quietness is needed, the game could be played without the sound. Totally worth the $1.99.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this app!I think that it is easy to get coins and if you do not have thin app then you should get it.I give this app a 4because characters and boosts ae very pricey.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This really is a great game! It's very addictive and lots of fun for any age group! I love it! My kids love it when I let them play, too! So far, they are always coming up with new scenery, new characters and boards, and every once in a while a new item for play! It's a must have in my \\"book\\" or should I say kindle! :)
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This sound track is so amazing- gave it to my son as a Birthday gift& he also saw the movie with me- I saw it 4 times& every song makes you cry!  Please purchase this& make sure you see the movie. You will want  to watch it over &over again. Best musical ever! Hope it comes back 2 the big screen very soon.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I liked this book as I have the others... it's nice to have a completion. However. I wish it had only been about 2 to 4 chapters longer. Flesh out the ending and develop it just a little bit more. Then, at least to me, I would have felt more complete. Perhaps it was intentional,so as to leave room for more? Either way,great book, great series! Cool concept! Now that it is completed, it would be nice for those of you that, like me, grow weary of reading a first novel in this type of book and then get frustrated waiting for the other books to get written!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I was little hesitant on how this album would turn out since the last one was so great & Timbaland produced it but I was not disappointed at ALL!  Timbaland is at his best AGAIN!  This is an awesome album from beginning to end.  My favorite song is \\"Mirrors\\" which has a wonderful video portraying JT's grandparent's love for one another with undertones of that love being passed to him & his new bride.  This album was defintely written with his new wife (Jessica Biel) in mind I believe.  Very good album, a definite must own!
0062014536|3.0|First Impressions: I was absolutely dying to get my hands on a copy of Requiem. I forced my husband to wake up at the crack of dawn so we could drive to the bookstore and get a copy on its release day. Then he was kind enough to drive me all the way down to Washington D.C. so I could have it signed by Lauren. I have the best husband. Anyway, after the huge cliffhanger that left me pulling my hair out a year earlier, I needed to dig into this book to find out what happened.<br /><br />First 50 Pages: The book started off shortly after the ending of Pandemonium, three days later I believe. Now, I avoided reading reviews of Requiem like the plague because I didn't want anything to be ruined for me by over-sharers, so I'm going to be kind of vague with this review for those who haven't had a chance to read it yet. I'll say that the beginning of Requiem started off a bit slower than I would have liked. Here's why:<br /><br />Characters & Plot: There are essentially two story lines going on in this book. First we have Lena's point of view, which we had in the rest of the trilogy, and I was cool with where she was heading in this book. Her character has changed so much since Delirium. She has hardened to the world of the Wilds and throughout the book she really begins to question whether she made the right choice in leaving the safe and secure Valid world. A new character is introduced that challenges her and makes her quite jealous and she has to face those feelings for the first time. Lena is conflicted throughout most of the story and it's not until the last few pages where she finally realizes what she really wants and who she really wants.<br /><br />The other story that was being told was Hana's story. She had her procedure to cure her of the love disease, but it didn't work quite right. She is preparing for her wedding to Fred, the mayor's son, who will soon be the mayor due to his father's death. It was interesting to look into the mind of a Cured and see what remained. I'll admit that I wasn't crazy about her part being shown in this book at first, but Lena and Hana's stories tie together so nice. I hated Fred and if I were Hana, I would have killed him. He's such a huge jerk!<br /><br />Alex returns from the Crypts a changed man. He's hardened, too. The Crypts broke his spirit and he finds his strength in another character other than Lena. Meanwhile Lena leans on Julian for support. In fact, she sort of uses him in this book. The connection between Lena and Julian is so different than what they had in Pandemonium. I couldn't really connect to either character in this book. Julian is just sort of there and he doesn't go through any sort of personal growth besides trying to earn or win his place in their group. Alex is so stand-offish throughout most of the story, so don't expect to read about the character most of us fell in love with in Delirium.<br /><br />While I enjoyed Lauren Oliver's writing style and lyrical prose, something seemed off to me in this book. The supporting characters didn't seem as important and I didn't find as many passages that made me stop and pause to soak in. I did like how Lauren used both of Hana and Lena's viewpoints.<br /><br />One of the things I liked the most was the story of Solomon. I loved how it was presented and I loved how it was used to cement Lena's choice between Alex and Julian. If you understood the story, you can understand why Lena made the decision that she did.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: SA! Don't read any more because I'm going to vent about the ending!! You've been warned.<br /><br />Okay, what the heck kind of ending was that? I go back and forth between hating it, wanting to cry, and just being plain-old frustrated that there will not be a fourth book. Nothing happens. Nothing is resolved. We don't get to see what happens to any of the characters or how the war plays out. The characters seem to have won their battle at Portland, but that's about as far as it goes. There isno resolution. Lena makes her decision between Alex and Julian. The end. We have no closure for Julian, Hana, or anyone else. I have no idea what happened to Fred. The supporting characters were completely forgotten about.<br /><br />I don't even know how to end this review. Lauren Oliver has no plans to continue writing this series. I don't think I love the open ending of this trilogy. I feel let down. I was just expecting....more. I still think this book is worth reading, especially for huge fans. Just don't be too let down by the ending!no resolution. Lena makes her decision between Alex and Julian. The end. We have no closure for Julian, Hana, or anyone else.

B001CDLAT4|3.0|While the cinematography is mind-blowing beautiful, the film has no plot that I can discern. It's not cohesive. The movie gathers several scenes, groups them under a quasi theme, then jumbles them all together. There's no flow. Also, some scenes are genuinely disturbing. I took off a star for the lack of flow and a second for the yuck factor.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|THIS IS A STORY THAT YOU CAN LOSE YOURSELF IN. A MIX OF FANTASY AND REAL  LIFE.  A GREAT CONCEPT OF TAKING VINTAGE PHOTOS AND USING THEM TO CREATE THE STORYLINE.

1451695195|1.0|While it was a fascinating read, the story sounded too much like a Hallmark movie script:<br /><br />(1) with the Harvard doctor coming back from the dead literally at the very moment his doctor was going to remove life support;<br /><br />(2) a psychic communicating with him on the other side;<br /><br />(3) total recall of everything that happened to him over there (the \\"ultra-reality\\"), but the distinguished doctor failed to give the reader any insight into the answers on the meaning of life that he claimed were all answered for him; and finally<br /><br />(4) definite proof it all really happened after he sees a photo of his deceased biological sister for the first time just after returning to this physical world - she was the girl on the butterfly wing - {violins playing here}.<br /><br />Just too many hokey cliché moments that seem more like the script to a movie than real life.<br /><br />Did you know that he is Harvard doctor? It was only mentioned about 100 times in the book as proof that everything in the book must be true. The claim that he \\"died\\" better than anyone else on earth ever did is rather narcissistic if you ask me.<br /><br />You can often get great insight into people's motives by following-the-money. The doctor's website advertised at the end of his book has a creepy cult-like feel to it. You can be a benefactor of his \\"Blue Butterfly Society\\" for an annual gift of at least $25,000. For those of you less well off, a annual gift of $1,200 will give you the status of Archangel. (How much for a ride on that butterfly?) I thought the point here was that we were going to leave the physical world for a better place where we are all loved? I see all that love does not come cheap.<br /><br />\\"The degree to which Eternia succeeds in its efforts to educate humanity about these postulates and accept them as true should result in a direct decrease in the following:<br /><br />War and violence<br />Hunger and malnutrition<br />Gender and racial inequality\\"<br /><br />So now that Dr. Bow Tie knows that God exists and has now told us, for only a small stipend of at least $25,000 per year he will create world peace. Christians all over the world have known God exists for several thousand years now, and achieving that world peace thing has proved elusive so far.<br /><br />Maybe the world just needed a Harvard neurosurgeon to make it happen. Put me in for $25,000.<br /><br />In fact, I will contribute another $5,000 if he can also prove Global Warming.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|I love Celtic Woman. I have almost all of the CDs and DVDs and I can't wait to see them in concert for the 3rd time. I adore listening to these wonderful women.
B005FISBTO|3.0|I should start off by saying that this is a great season of Dexter in which we get to see a lot of development out of all of the characters. I particularly like the dynamic between good and evil, how Dexter deals with light and dark and how Dexter struggles to contend with things that seem to be higher than himself. It's an interesting season that definitely shouldn't be missed for any Dexter fans.<br />SO now on to the DVD review itself. I have been a huge fan of Dexter since season one. It always feels great to get the latest season and add it to my shelf like Dexter adds slides to his box. However I have noticed a trend with the DVD box sets that is just too big to ignore.The quality. Don't get me wrong, I am not a guy that has to have HD picture or even Blu Ray for everything, I am perfectly content with a good old fashioned regular DVD but this season's picture quality is quite frankly atrocious. It's pixelated and dark to the point that I can't even tell what some smaller objects even are. I don't know who did a quality check on this but they need to seriously find a new job. The plastic is cheap and flimsier than it has ever been and that's saying quite a bit because they have always used the smaller cases for each season but this is the first time I have had one just break one use.  The special features are sub par but really they have never had interesting features on their DVDs. I wish I could say that this was the fault of the 3rd party vendor I bought it from on Amazon but unfortunately the season was SEALED when I got it so there was no way for the 3rd party vendor to tamper with it unless they are just seriously good at making it look factory sealed,which I doubt. I am seriously surprised that anyone from Showtime, CBS DVD or Paramount had the gumption to put their name on this poorly executed box set and quite frankly they should be ashamed for such a serious slip in quality.<br />I am just hoping that in the future they will decide to put a bit moretime and effort in to giving me a quality product instead of just shoving the DVD out there and trying to rip me off.
B000002GOZ|5.0|I won't tell you how old I was when this CD came out. I used my original CD so much I can't play it anymore, so I finally gave in and replaced it. Love it still. This one is a must for any true Bryan Adams fan.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I got this book based on the suggestion of a friend and read it in three days. Flynn's writing has a unique flavor and her descriptions are often not only apt, but hilariously so. The story of Nick & Amy was captivatingly disturbing & I found my self rooting-for and disgusted-by at various turns. A great read that will leave you wanting to read &#34;just one more chapter.&#34;
B009JBZH54|1.0|I would love to watch it, but it came with an extra special feature disk instead of the movie. WOOO more behind the scenes! I bet this looks awesome in the movie!
B009X01ELC|5.0|Exactly as described. Love it. Worth the money. Especially to use while lying down and wanting to read comfortably - the case acts as a stand to hold my book up.

1476734941|5.0|I am thrilled to have this little book as a reference through my two days per week of fasting! I had been searching for a healthful way to fast, when I stumbled upon a TV show on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) featuring Michael Mosley. I quickly became fascinated by the scientific studies and amazing results using 'The Fast Diet,' shown on this broadcast. I read some of the reviews and purchased the book. I found that 'The Fast Diet,\\" offers an easy-to-follow and sound methodology. I've completed two sets of fasting using the method outlined and never felt hungry. I also like the many meal plan examples and the convincing case studies. The proof for me is that it is working; some early, measureable health benefits are occurring. Thank you Dr. Mosley and Mimi Spencer for putting this helpful book out there.<br /><br />Author of [[ASIN:B0093MHAVS Braving Time: Finding the Way Back]]

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Was attracted to this as I loved the Kim Stanley Robinson Trilogy on Mars so was hoping it would be another \\"everyday inhabiting Mars against the odds\\" tale and I wasn't disappointed. Was hooked from the first few pages.<br /><br />Stranded on Mars with slim chance of rescue. You have to know what happens next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers beats out rival Temple Run in so many ways. Without having to tilt your device to play, it's easier to play in more comfortable settings and positions (you can kick back in a recliner, or even lay down). The Colorado arr bright, challenges endless, and the fast pace keeps you hitting \\"play\\" time after time. I'm hooked!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Having spent the last 3 months on a totally uncontrolled and nearly exclusive diet of m/m romance, I decided to pop in a dose of my more usual genre: sci fi. I made an excellent choice. If you're a fan of space exploration, and believe that we really do have to start by at least sending people to Mars, which is only right next door for heaven's sake, picture a lone astronaut accidentally stranded on Mars.<br /><br />His situation is tragic and dire, but the whole book is about ingenuity, hope, and keeping your sense of humor in the face of catastrophically dismal odds. The guy comes up with really astounding engineering solutions to interesting, dangerous situations that arise for him on Mars, and explains them to us as simply as if he were telling us how to assemble a breakfast of cold cereal, milk, juice and a cup of tea. And Mars really does NOT cut him a break. I admit I didn't understand all of the science that was going on, but the parts I did understand seemed thoroughly researched and accurate. And as for plausibility, if astronauts selected for such planetary exploration missions are truly as well versed in physics, chemistry, electronics, biology and orbital mechanics as I believe they must be, this guy's powers of innovation and problem-solving are totally believable. And the technology at his disposal is truly not far from what we've got now. There are no warp drives, food replicators or calls like \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" when the going gets rough. Raw human determination and basic (well, advanced, but documented) science are really the main tools he's got.<br /><br />A truly enjoyable read, and you don't have to be a die-hard sci fi fan like me to become totally engrossed by this story.
B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|So far so good! I have not had a chance to watch them all to see if all them have the same quality and format that others have complained about. They came fast like they were suppose to so no issues there. The only thing that they don't tell you is which version US or UK these are. The first movie is Harry and the Philosophers Stone which is the UK version and while it really doesn't matter it would be nice to know.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I absolutely love it do u hear me!  loveeee it lol.  and I just have fun with alll the effects and collated with fame and friends lol.  the freaking best :D
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|The movie was absolutely cute! As for the 4 star rating I was disappointed because I bought this on Amazon for a few dollars cheaper and of course it went on sale at Target the next week. I would recommend the movie but look to see where to get the best deal on it.

0307361012|4.0|Let's face it, in the last few years Scandinavian mysteries have been in vogue. Of course, the problem is that the fact that a mystery series is written by someone from that area of the world does not guarantee its quality, there are duds like in every other place. Luckily, this first book in the Harry Hole series by Jo Nesbo delivers the quality we have come to expect, or at least hope to get. The mystery actually develops in Australia, where Harry is sent to assist in the murder of a Norwegian citizen, after he was part and parcel in some disastrous events that lead to the death of a co-worker.<br /><br />I have to acknowledge that the pace of the book is pretty slow at times, though there are riveting moments of action too. Even with these slow spells, it is never boring, especially because the authors incorporates a variety of elements to keep us engaged. Not only we have the case Harry is working on together with the Sidney police. There is also the romance portion of the story, as well as the relationships Harry establishes with some other local characters. We also get to find out about Harry's past, the details of the situation that pushed him to Sidney and the facts around his first love. Beyond that, the book goes into the racial undertones present in Australian society, and the prejudice against the aborigines and how it is veiled. I particularly enjoyed the folk stories interspersed throughout this novel.<br /><br />Most of all, the character of Harry is one of the central elements that drive this story. An addicted and flawed main character is not foreign to Scandinavian thrillers, but even though the idea is not too original, we get to read about a fascinating character and it ultimately leaves us wanting to read more of this series. I am confident that further books in this series will improve on the weakest aspect of The Bat, which is the actual case Harry works on. If that is the case, I will be reading Nesbo for some time!

I've been all over Western Europe and visited many of the locations in the book, wrote a paper on the Strategic Bombing Campaign at Air War College many years ago and just visited the Mighty Eighth Air Force Museum at Savannah, GA. This book is a gem and tugs at your heart. It is a fine tribute to the courageous young Airmen on both sides of that conflct and a reminder that chivalry is still possible in the heat of battle. It's a must read for anyone interested in the air war over Europe.

How this series plays out, it is too early to tell.<br />But the first episode has me deeply intrigued on its development.<br />Often first episodes are among the worst of a series. But this one had me glued. It stands on its own merits rather than a warped version of the movie (which in my opinion, the Hannibal movies are a warped version of the books).<br />It's different enough that the story is fresh in many ways.<br />It's familiar enough that the characters are familiar.<br /><br />Wow.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Interesting story line, terrific graphics...delighted I don't have to post to Facebook.  Will look for this company for more games
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I have watched seasons 1 and 2 so far. Preferred season 1 to season 2. Season 2 was far more serious. I loved seeing the rigid class differences and how everyone accepts them. Maggie Smith is hilarious as the dowager countess and has the best lines.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Lost is such a great show. I always find myself watching more then one episode a night. There are so many twist and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire season. Very well written and produced season.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a good read, with a story told from two different perspectives, worth the time spend reading.  Loved the last couple pages.
B00BVVA138|5.0|This is a great album, not my favorite by Killswitch, but a very good album. I bought the special edition which is well worth the money. The four tracks you can by anywhere, so thats not what made the deal for me. The DVD was cool, which made it worth it in my opinion. It explains alot, like how Jesse came back and how the band almost broke up a couple years ago. Again very good cd, Killswitch never dissapoints.
0938045768|5.0|This might be the best $30 I've ever spent!  I've done the gym memberships, with marginal results.  I don't like spending the money on the monthly membership, or have to organize a &#34;trip&#34; (get my stuff together, drive there, work out, shower, drive back, change).  And then there's the problems with the joints: elbows, shoulders, knees.  Guess what?  They're not supposed to hurt!<br /><br />Enter Convict Conditioning - you need two props: a pullup bar and a basket ball.  Oh, and a floor and a body.  The routines build muscle and make you stronger.  After even 2 months, the changes have been significant for me.  And the routines?  Between 5 and 20 minutes a night, and my muscles rarely feel sore or weary afterwards (and yet, they keep getting stronger).  And my joints?  Feel better!<br /><br />I've also reread the book at least 20 times - the writing is clear, good images on the exercise, with some engaging background stories and explanations.<br /><br />The one problem some people might have: some people seem to thrive on a partner or other people around to engage them (or show off?) while they exercise.  These exercises are really intended to be done on your own - which suits me perfectly.<br /><br />I plan to buy several copies of this book to distribute to friends and family (birthday presents, etc).  I wish I had heard about this book 15 years ago...highly recommended!!
B0000AOWV0|4.0|I really liked the product .. but the truth came very wrinkled .. shame because these objects I collect them .. be more careful when send products<br /> you for the fast shipping and safe ... keep it as efficient thanks

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't get tired of playing this game like I do with so many.  The power ups really make it more interesting.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Slow moving and not much plot...<br />The \\"gore\\" isn't even enough to keep you interested...<br />Not worth the time I spent...
B007REV4YI|5.0|Simply from the beginning, through the titles, to the very end, this is the best Bond ever. it totally captures the character, who in this, has been shot, nearly drowned and almost outwitted by a rogue MI-6 Agent. Craig gives his finest performance so far in this, and Judi Dench as M is, as always superb. The rest of the cast is also excellent. Just a brilliant movie that is to Bond what The Dark Knight Rises is to Batman. See it!
031620157X|5.0|Chris really hit the jackpot with this one.<br />I love this book, the story is great. I hope they make a movie out of it cause it has great potential.<br />The book arrived perfectly and it's beautiful to see with your own eyes up close.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Used to be Sean Connery was my favorite bond. Now he's second. Daniel Craig is the runningest, hardest, most beaten up bond of all. In this, a direct sequel to Casino Royale, Bond is taking on Quantum the organization that forced Vesper to become a traitor. The action is fast and heavy with the villains after an interesting natural resource. Olga Kurylenko is a fine bond girl and Gemma Arterton is excellent as a tragic MI-6 operative. A fun movie and worth owning.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My friend had been telling me about Fringe for quite sometime, and with it being available to Amazon Prime customers at no additional charge, I finally dove in. (I watch it using my PS3). I don't watch many evening programs on broadcast/cable TV, and I do not enjoy walking into a serialized program in mid season.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy the wonderful stories first and foremost. I enjoy the idea that only now are we discovering how things/events that occurred back in the 60's and 70's are impacting our lives today. The continuing story arc has me hooked. Next, I truly enjoy the characters and appreciate the actors who portray them.<br /><br />There is a degree of freshness to the creative side of the production that I enjoy, also.
B0036R92V2|1.0|Wow. A double dislike. I didn't care for the overlong, with plenty of boring scenes to it, Django Unchained (Tarantino really needs to learn about editing), and I didn't like this &#34;Cult Classic&#34; either. Overlong with some outrageously bad acting (I did watch it subtitled, rather than dubbed), this is one of those films that to me, doesn't deserve the title Cult film. Can't hold a candle to the truly great spaghetti westerns by a master like Sergio Leone. It may be a cup to tea to some, but not to me.
076421120X|5.0|Darlene Zschech, renowned worship leader, song writer, and speaker, pours out her heart of praise in the book Revealing Jesus: a 365-Day Devotional.  Based on her personal prayer journal and rooted in her longing for Jesus to be revealed in her life, she engages the reader to draw closer to God and know Him more.  Styled in the typical traditional format of opening with a Scripture passage and closing with a short prayer for each day of the year, she begins each month centered on a theme and introduced with the lyrics of a hymn.<br /><br />In the easy-to-read and concise one-page daily reading, she reminds of God's love and care and points to His Holy Spirit for our strength and joy. She reminds us of the various facets of His character as revealed in His names in the Bible.  While drawing on many characters throughout the Bible as relatable examples, she shows how God is also calling us to Himself, calling us to a bold and gutsy faith that stands and reflects Christ wherever we find ourselves.  Through themes for reflection and meditation, she inspires us to live knowing that everyday life itself can be an act of worship.<br /><br />The classy cover and page designs invite the reader to open it and ponder the words and reflect.  This book would be a great gift book for a wide range of people - new or mature believers or worship leaders, etc., whether or not you are an actual fan of her music.  A companion CD is also available.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary copy of this book by Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review.
B009POHHR6|5.0|Ever wonder what would have happened if Kal-El's spacecraft had ended up in the Soviet Union? Well wonder no longer as Mark Millar has written one of the best of the Elseworlds stories ever written. Becoming the first citizen of the USSR, which rapidly becomes the only super power, while the isolated and paranoid US, led by Lex Luthor seeks to thwart him. I can't say anymore other than to read this refreshing take on the last survivor of Krypton!
B004GTLFNW|4.0|Well- written, logical presentation of philosophy and exercises. Good photos. Only complaint is difficulty moving around within Kindle edition. Worth the price!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is a game I have been looking for ever since LOL stopped working on my computer! This is an amazing game!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great idea, gripping story. I couldn't put it down. I will be reading more of Howey's books. I can't wait to get the next part of the series.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|nice Internet easy to type and easy to press on do not ever ever ever never ever ever lose it or delete it
B008AX1HD8|2.0|Hard book to pick up, I took 3 weeks to finish reading it.  As an Australian I did not believe a lot of the references, very cliche. Would not recommend this book. I enjoyed other books by this author but not this one.<br />Diane
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good version of Solitaire - great for keeping busy when you don't have internet access and have some free time to keep busy.  It's great when a passenger in a car or on a plane.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I do not recommend this product because the advertising is too disruptive.  the ads kept me from starting a game and interrupted me in the middle of a game.<br /><br />I don't watch most commercial television because of ads!  why would i want to play a game that interupts my train of thought?<br /><br />i deleted it from my product.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best horror/drama series ever to capture on television. It would be nice to have a movie made for theaters as well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a little bit glitchy at times, but it does affect gameplay. The graphics are good and the game runs pretty smoothly. However, the game lacks a lot of excitement and fun factor that it could have. Overall, it's an okay game

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I used to love this game, but its been messing up, the games I have with people get deleted and when I try to enter a new game with them it says their unavailable. recently all the Colors I bought were deleted and most of my coins are gone too. I deleted app and redownloaded it, but it wont let me back in the game.
0345803507|5.0|A great book - highly recommend to those that can handle reading (or reading around) kinky stuff.  The love story is so worth it and the vanilla sex is..well... :)<br /><br />Laters, Baby!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Maggie Smith is superb!!! She brings such life and fun to any character.  I hope they plan on a season 4!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I babysit my young cousin and she can't get enough of this game. She is horse crazy so it's not hard to entertain her with such good-looking graphics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome. I am addicted to it. It is do fun to play it very hard to discribe. If you love temple run than you will love subway subway surfers it the exact same thing. But its different because its better. I love it you should try it. If you do have fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great! More political than the first book. Shocking twists around every corner. If you liked Hunger Games, you should like this too.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|I thought this flick was good until the Seal's raid.  This was the part I wanted to see most.  This should be the most important part of the movie. But we get nothing but a body bag.  Very bad.  We don't even get to see Osama's face or the actor being him before he is shot. This movie is ok in the details of the plan to find him but fails in the final execution.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Very similar to any farm/zoo/park game. everything has an eh loading time and you spend real money for fake money for fake coins to speed things up.
145470246X|5.0|Sabine Lippert's beading book is wonderful. Lots of great idea's with understandable instructions. Sabine is a great jewelry talent and definitely someone to keep on eye on in the future as she expands her talents even further. Good job Sabine!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love that it saves your progress and upgrades, much more interesting than previous versions(though I miss the penguins!)<br />Only problems- sometimes it freezes my android phone and I have to turn off the phone and restart, and there is no easy way to quit the game.

B00B2V66VS|1.0|I bought this for my granddaughter to play on my Kindle Fire and it works for a day and then you have reinstall it as it won't load, losing all your statistics and gems and coins.  She has Temple Run 1 and Temple Run Brave and they work flawlessly.  What's up with that?  No error msg or anything.  The mfr needs to test products before putting them out to the customer.  Very disappointed.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|The app needs to be able to delete entire notebooks. It also needs to have the option to organize notes in a notebook manually, not just by date and stuff.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is not a series for the squeamish.<br />Fantastic writing with a twist in each episode, which I think is even better with Season 2.  The cast is amazing and so is the set keeping it based in the era taking place.  This show is a crazy page turner only you don't get to stay up and fast forward as with a book, however, if you are catching up like me doing a marathon of season 1 is well worth a day on the couch.
0345803493|4.0|This book was much more vanilla than the first but continues to develop the story line which is good. Hope this helps.
0865478767|2.0|I found this book a difficult read.  I'm not a someone who reads a lot about translations, but I do enjoy languages.  This book bogged down on the first pages and never did loosen up.  I'll admit I only got half-way through before putting it down, but I doubt there was enough left in the second half to save it.
B005PK1G76|4.0|It's nothing special but it gets the job done so I would recommended it based on the great price! Great for storage!
B00B5DNDR8|5.0|I'm a 52-year-old guy who just recently acquired a taste for \\"melodic metal\\" from enjoying Avantasia, and subsequently, Edguy. It's been an exciting journey since then, discovering many more bands with the melodic metal sound that I enjoy so much. A few weeks ago, someone here on Amazon suggested that I check out Gamma Ray, which I did. My first Gamma Ray purchase was their awesome \\"Skeletons & Majesties\\" live DVD (recorded at Pratteln, Switzerland). I've since bought many more of their CDs, and while I'm still new to this band, I've heard enough that I know I really enjoy them. Kai Hansen is one of the best frontmen I've ever seen (naturally friendly, warm and relaxed, yet confident at the same time).<br /><br />So today, after a bit of a delay, \\"Master Of Confusion\\" finally arrived in the mail. I wasn't really expecting all that much, since it is technically an EP. But wow, I've only listened to it once all the way through, and I was astounded. The two original new studio tracks are great, of course. The title track's intro sounds a LOT like Helloween's \\"I Want Out\\" intro, even to my newbie ears, but that's not a real detraction, as the song itself is great.<br /><br />Next up are two cover tracks, \\"Death Or Glory\\" and \\"Lost Angels\\". I'd never heard the original \\"Death Or Glory\\" before, but I can say that Gamma Ray's version sounds really good. But what really caught my ear was their faithful (pretty much note-for-note) re-creation of the classic Sweet track \\"Lost Angels\\". Speaking now as an old dude, Sweet was my favorite band when I was a young dude, and hearing \\"Lost Angels\\" again after all these years was a true nostalgia trip. And while it was a note-for-note replica, Gamma Ray has breathed new life into it, giving it a lot of heart in the performance, and even making it sound better through improved recording techniques. It really blew me away, and took me by surprise.<br /><br />Then we have six more songs, recorded live at Zeche, Bochum (a small indoor venue in Germany). \\"The Spirit\\", \\"Wings Of Destiny\\", \\"Gamma Ray\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"Time To Break Free\\" (with Michael Kiske doing a brilliant job on lead vocals), and \\"Insurrection\\". All of these songs can also be found on the \\"Skeletons & Majesties\\" CD set, however, the songs here are from a different performance, and thus have a different flavor to them. In fact, to me they sound even better here. Again, I was very pleasantly surprised, not expecting such high quality. Note that the Zeche, Bochum versions of these six songs are included on the Bonus DVD on the 2-DVD \\"Skeletons & Majesties\\" set, but NOT included on the 2-CD set, which features only the Pratteln performance.<br /><br />So, while yes, this may be technically an EP, you get a full hour of stellar music from beginning to end. A must-have for fans of course, but I also consider this CD a great place to start as a sampler for someone new to the band, as it has a great combination of new studio tracks, cover tracks, and live tracks from their past, each and every track executed flawlessly. I also thought the mixing and mastering were outstanding. I cranked it up on my living room stereo system, and could find no fault. This release has far exceeded my expectations.ue in Germany). \\"The Spirit\\", \\"Wings Of Destiny\\", \\"Gamma Ray\\", \\"Farewell\\", \\"Time To Break Free\\" (with Michael Kiske doing a brilliant job on lead vocals), and \\"Insurrection\\".

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a great book for all ages.  It has spiritual concepts yet having nothing to do with religion.  It has moments of sacrifice, nobility, weakness, profound yet simple thoughts on life in general.  Loved it.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found this novel to be a candid account of the effects of a disease none of our children should endure. The characters were beautifully drawn out and engaging. I've recommended this novel to a councilor friend of mine because I think she too could learn from it.

As an Expat myself I started to wonder about others in our community.<br />Some highly unlikely scenarios, but hey they pulled the plot along. Best scenes for me are when all four main protagonists are together, especially at their final meeting.

B00422LESO|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and at first the story sounded too weird to swallow. But as I read more and more, I found myself connecting with the main character more than I thought I ever would. The story was a great one, and the ending was amazing.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 13 or 14. There is some swearing, but not anything major. That and the fact that there are a couple of times when there is passionate kissing. Not too graphic, but... clear... (for lack of a better word.)<br />This book (now that I look back) is a romance novel. The perfect girly-teenage novel. (Don't think that guys would get much out of this book.) I say this because the story is basically about this woman who is obsessed with Pride and Prejudice, and goes to a resort where people come to be... wooed... by paid actors. The main character, Jane, goes to this resort as a 'final fling' for her obsessions. She vows that afterword, she's going to leave that world behind. Basically, the story is about a woman finding herself.

If any reader out there got paid as much as you all do I am positive they would be writing a new sequel well within a year, let alone 3 years. George R.R.Martin anyone? He pissed me off already, lets stop dragging this s*** out. Same goes for you Sanderson.

The kung fu scrat game is rather cute and it is a game that is ongoing. Takes a long time but if you have time to waste, this is a great game. Much better than most free apps I have encountered.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|iawesome! a.love it<br />its.like.mario.bros there many scenarios n u can go and jump and the.litlle.leaves there are.like lifes.and.the.graffics are so funny
B002UZCJP2|4.0|Might  be somewhat foretelling.  Wall-E  from Disney  has similar &#34;theme&#34; about living life through a machine.  Today,  many live much of their lives through their smartphone,  laptop, computer, etc.  The next logical step is the topic of this movie.<br /><br />The first time in theaters I found a bit ... disjointed somewhat.  Poor editing?
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Very well thought out- encourages my kids to use their responses to motion very well- they don't get mad when they crash because they always know they can try again without losing- definitely a win win game all around-
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i really enjoy this game, especially the fact you're a shark. it's not hard to grasp and you just never get bored of it!
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|Takes too long to acquire more coins to upgrade our use different cars- where is the end of the courses?  Can't seem to make it to next check point no matter how good you are driving- fun but not something that keeps me coming back for more-
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|As always, this vendor continues to perform great service to me. Love the CD. I always go back to them.
B00BXJZ07A|5.0|For those who lamented the loss of the del-lords band in the 80's your prayers have been answered. the del-lords have reformed and released an incredible americana/roots rock album called\\"elvis club\\". that classic del-lords sound is still there with the main difference being more guitars up front.they rock even harder than before.eric\\"roscoe'ambel has done a great job with the sound production and his signature guitar work. scott kempner proves once again he is one of the best writers in the business.from the opening of\\"when the drugs kick in\\" through \\"flying\\" and onto \\"southern pacific\\"you will be on a wild ride so hold on tight.this is truly one of the best releases of 2013.
B0052GACNM|5.0|my mother loved it she listens to is all the timed.......................... ...... .... .... .... ... ... ... ... .
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Pure entertainment.<br />  Tom Sawyer is a fun read, one can't help but to laugh out loud. Mark Twain 's tale of these rascal boys is truly timeless. You will not be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am only on the first book of the trilogy and am already hooked. I picked up the book and finished it in two days. I would have finished it in a day but I had to sleep. So descriptive, intriguing, and passionate. I love this author. I can't wait til read the rest. It really keeps your heart racing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|LOVED the book, couldn't put it down, but I was a little disappointed by the end, it was a little like the author got tired, and took the easy way out.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The premise is fascinating and revolting, the lead character is extremely well played by Jennifer Lawrence. The other characters were good as well.<br />I felt there was not enough of an emotional crescendo to the film and the second half felt a little lackluster and the premise and plto points could have been better developed in some parts.<br />Still, I understand that it's setting the stage for future stories so I'll be watching the next in the series.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|works like an alarm clock should day in day out, no problems. never fails to do what it was designed to do.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|I first caught this band's cover of Gotye's \\"Somebody That I Used To Lnow\\" at two in the morning while surfing the satellite channels. What caught my eye was all of them gathered around a single guitar. What caught my ear was how GOOD they sounded working with so little accompaniment. I got up and wrote down the band's name. That morning I was amazed to see how much of their material was on Youtube. The more I listened the more I realized how talented this band is. They've covered so much material in their videos and on their porevious releases that I'm convinced they could turn \\"Happy Birthday\\" into something completely unique. Their own material holds up pretty well too (\\"Summer Vibe\\" and \\"Red Hands\\" are two fine examples here). I suggest you check them out on Youtube. There'ds a wealth of material in all different styles to be found, and they look and sound like they're having a blast putting it together. Do yourself a favor. Buy this disc, pick a nice sunny day, put it in your car player and go for a drive and ENJOY it! Great stuff...very refreshing to hear!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good always wins, but with twist. Put a cat up against the wall - they will come out scratching. Really!
0300169787|5.0|After reading this book, I felt like I've known Alexander McQueen. The photos present his works as works of art. A must read for anyone interested in fashion.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Game would not play on my Kindle Fire.  It was deleted immediately so that I would not become frustrated by it.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|I really liked being able to watch this movie online. I was going to watch the second part so I needed a refresher.
030758836X|5.0|Now I know why it's still #2 on the NYT fiction list.  The first few chapters seemed a little slow, but then I couldn't put it down.  It would make a great summer read!!!!
1601252463|5.0|The Advanced Player's Guide builds off the Core Rulebook, with extra spells, feats and classes. It also adds to the Core Classes with interesting traits that help create a stronger background for your character, and gives some bonuses along the way too.
B0024F08RO|5.0|My husband and I never watched the show when it was on television but we have watched every single episode and it is by far our favorite series. It is exciting and what Michael can do is incredible. Of course Linc isn't so bad himself.
1601251831|5.0|Huge variety of monsters to face in the Pathfinder roleplay game, and the Bestiary gives you detailed illustrations and all the stats you need to fill out an adventure. While online resources and PDFs provide some of the same information, there is no comparison to having the hardcover book in your hands!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this series after hearing about it on a radio station. I loved every book. I was so excited when I found out that it was being made into a move - which I also love. Of course as an avid reader I think that the book was way better than the movie but I am bias. Katniss is a great heroine because she is able to take care of herself and yet isn't arrogant or unlikable like many characters are nowadays. Would definitely recommend this series - be prepared to be torn between Gale and Peeta!
1601251505|5.0|If you're using PDFs or online resources, you can technically access all the rules that are in this book, however, there is no comparison to actually holding the hard cover book! Fantastic artwork throughout really adds to the reading of the rules.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I am a very big fan of Adobe! This app was purchased to enable secure document opening on my Kindle Fire; it did not disappoint!<br />While I had read reviews that stated that the Kindle was already enabled to open pdfs, it did not work! I would always suggest that you go to the company that owns an app; they made it!
B000006YMN|5.0|Like another reviewer, I had this album on CD back in the 80's and played it OVER and OVER and OVER again.  I just loved her melodies, crips clean vocals and her unmistakably Agnetha in this album.<br />My favorite was always &#34;Little White Lies&#34;, but the entire album rings true for me.  Listening to some of the clips over again on some site I found brought fond memories back for me.<br />I'll never understand why this album is blocked in the U.S. on iTunes, but not a problem for me.  I'll pay the premium to have this beautiful voice in my collection again!
B009DJB8I2|4.0|Sadly I can only give 4 stars because one song is missing.<br />'Exile Vilify' performed by 'The National' is not included.<br />I love this song and have to show my dissapointment by not rating this 5 stars.<br />People that didn't get the 'Final Transmission' achievement won't miss this lovely tune cause they've never heard it.<br />Al least not while playin Portal 2.<br />You should replay the game and be more thorough this time.<br />In one of the test chambers there's a secret room.<br />One of Rat Man's hideouts.<br />If u don't know who Rat Man is u gotta read the comic.<br />Sorry, got carried away, big Portal fan obviously.<br />Love the games.<br />Love the soundtrack.<br />This set contains every song and musical score from Portal 1 & 2 (except one song, read above).<br />If u are into Team Fortress 2 u get a code for a realy lovely Portal 2 themed in-game item.<br />Also there is a Steam code for the game Dota 2 included.<br />I hope this review is comprehensible (because I'm german).<br />If it's not please excuse my lacking english skills.<br />And now click on the 'Add to Cart' button.<br />;-)
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|I rebooted more than once. I was nearing the finish and it just returned me to my queue over and again.  I paid to unlock. Boo.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love everything about these books.  The characters are wonderful and so believe able .  I would totally watch this relationship unfold onthecovers of the tabloids. And the twist and turns during this part of the tale nearly ripped out my heart. Can't wait for the next one
B00B2166BS|4.0|It works as advertized.<br />Plug it into the wall and it clicks into place on my Nexus 10's pogo port.<br />It could use stronger magnets and due to the design of the Nexus is difficult to use while charging, but works better that the default charger.<br />I no longer have to worry about breaking the connector in the charge port(which has ruined several of my past devices).
0374275637|4.0|Thinking, fast and slow packs a lot of studies into 500 or so pages. Unfortunately so little background was given on most of the studies that you couldn't tell how important they were.  You just had to rely on the conclusions given by Kahneman. I'm sure he's trustworthy, but we all have our biases.<br /><br />All in all, I think the book would have been helped by some serious editing and pruning.  I was left wanting to read a more engaging volume written by a selection of top 'con men', describing the flaws in human decision making that they prey on.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Everyone should see it at least once. Epic story, great characters, a universe of high tech mixed with low tech.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. it is so very addictive. the graphics are awesome and the gameplay is highly realistic.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I grew up with these movies, and they have lasted through the years as great movies. Everyone should see it at least once. Epic story, great characters, a universe of high tech mixed with low tech.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Usually I do not see movies adapted from books because I like to read more.  This movie though was very good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm concerned that I attributed more to the movie because of having read the book.  I mean that perhaps I give more credit to the plot (of the movie) because I know what they are trying to do (from the book).  In any event I recommend this movie for adults and teens (not younger children).  It's worth remembering Gale's comment at the beginning of the movie, &#34;... all we have to do is not watch.&#34;
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|\\" Drums of Autumn\\" Is the forth book in the \\"Outlander Saga\\". I strongly recommend that you start with the first book in the series, (1) Outlander-Cross Stitch (2) Dragon Fly in Amber (3) Voyager (4) Drums of Autumn (5) The Fiery Cross (6) A Breath of Snow and Ashes (7) An Echo In the Bone. I am a mere 4000 pages into this series and still craving more. Diana Gabaldon has woven a Masterpiece of an adventure; her storytelling is absolutely brilliant! These stories can be enjoyed by both men and women alike, the story line is based on true history, places and events.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Excellent books. One gets involved immediately upon start reading the books and it is very difficult to put the books aside. Larsson's plot is well thought of, he is a very good writer.
098357670X|5.0|As a beginner, this book has really helped me improve not just my caricature drawing but my ability to draw portraits in general. Having done caricature art for a few weeks now since I bought this book, I have become more and more comfortable with my skills and I haven't even gotten through half the book yet. It really accelerated my learning process and I highly recommend it.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|The Depeche Mode I fell in love with in the 80's has grown up in 2013 and for me it's an honor to be able to say that they have never let me down.<br />This record flows as a whole and I feel the passion they have for the music. Lyrically it's their darkest and deepest in a while.<br />Dave Gahan's voice is as alive as ever.<br />Thank you for 30 years of music that has been a soundtrack for my life..<br />Listen  with a great set of speakers and nice drink and a comfortable chair, you'll fall in love with this album as well.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This way a disappointment I only watched 20mins of this movie then switched off. I will ask for my money back on this.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry, which is what I look for in a good weekend read.  If you like books with history weaved in, this would be a great read for you.  The author manages to make you think about a part of history that people do not like to see, but are interested in at the same time.  The story inter twines several generations that are decades apart, but facing the same struggles.  I would definitely recommend this book, just make sure you have a box of tissue and a few hours because you will mot be able to stop reading once you start.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved this game. graphics were excellent and I was happy for the occasional hint button. there was a few times when touching in certain areas actually was not friendly. I recommend this for adults looking for something to do when Tv isn't on the agenda.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Muy buena peli con giros inesperados en un james bond!!! ademas la puedo agregar a la edición de los 50 años y uqe en la caja hay lugar para ella...
B0090SI4LU|3.0|Don't bash others for the view that don't match yours. It doesn't get anyone, anywhere.<br />I like to read, almost as much as I love movies. I read the book first, before I knew a movie was coming out.<br />Remember: The book is quite long. Much of what is in the book is in the movie. Some parts were shortened and preferring to put<br />in other parts. Yes, there are unknowns and a few recognizeable actors. The uncle for instance is the same guy who was the town leader in The Village.<br />This book/movie translation is quite close. The books plot drove me to read it and sometimes, sometimes a book to movie adaptation can show how a book might play out visually. I did not expect it to be flooded with special effects as the book wasn't written that way. In my opinion the movie was well done though could've warranted four stars. I might change my view later.<br />If you haven't read the book or don't read for fun, I suggest you start. Books might just reveal thing you might otherwise never learn.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I could not put this book down. Great story, characters and setting. In addition to wondering what would happen next I was amazed at the details on the games mentioned and the 1980's triva.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The twists and turns in 'Gone Girl' keep me reading late into the night. The plot was one I would never have expected. The intriguing main character cunningly wove an incredible story filled with suspense and at times horror.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|you have to buy things if u wanna be the best ... I just feel that it is unfair but fun
B009YP9L7U|5.0|WOW..This book was well like a fairytale but not a fairytale. It was totally believable at least to me. The book had me from word one and then it had me to the end. Meagan and Connor were the best and totally awesome. The author just had me and every page I kept getting deeper and deeper into the story.<br />I don't write a typical review. I would just like to say pick up this book and yes sit in your favorite spot with your favorite drink and be prepared cause this book will take you on a journey you will want to read over and over again. I know I will. Kudos to the author great book..Enjoy and thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game to play. My favorite was the part that they went to the Sydney one and I liked it because of the trains and architecture. But I also liked the Rome one because of the egg challenge.I think it is kind of like a different version of um...Temple Run so if you liked that game you will enjoy this one=D
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a cute game, entertaining and sweet for kids or really bored adults. Works well(: I haven't had any glitches so far!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really appreciate this app.  Worked great for planning my vacation wardrobe as it was very accurate.  At each destination the forecast predictions were on point.  Great vacationing and/or everyday tool to have....thanks !!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I loved the books as a kid, so I was expecting it to be a stinker or have nothing to do with the original, but they masterfully updated the movie without losing what made the book great.  Not only did I end up loving it, but my poor wife, who doesn't enjoy sci-fi movies like I do, ended up loving it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I too have a KINDLE FIRE hd,and this is fantastic!!! As response to the review earlier,maybe your kindle froze call Amazon, they r a great company, thrill HELP u with your kindle. THIS app. Really helps my husband and I to keep track of the battery life,as to plan for a movie,etc. Plus its Free!!!THANK you, Amazon!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is one of my favourite games and I want to know who has the best score in the world.<br /><br />My score is 2373120 and my name is Sophie Morgan
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this game is definetly worth the $7 this game is just like black ops with similar graphics and your able to knife so 5stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really recommend this game for all ages because it's fun and easy to enjoy. I like how the game does a world tour to different places and then they have different exclusive game items. I really enjoy this game.
B0015AARJI|4.0|it is a  good product for everyone, lot of fun garantee, it was what I was looking for since a long time
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone. Love anything my Nicholas Sparks.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Terrible, don't waste your time.  These movies continue to deteriorate.  Really lame plot and the action scenes were underwhelming.  Why no gagets?  Daniel Craig doesn't even act and must go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|As I am a kid I will tell you a kids point of view. I personally love the game as it is addictive because you always want to beat your highscore my highest score is 99190 beat that !!
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This is a simple to learn strategy game that plays fast. Each game only takes about 10 minutes, so it's great when you just have a little while to play. It is easy enough for a child or newbie to play on the easiest setting but gets very challenging on harder settings. The sound effects are good and the music is OK though just as repetitive as any other video game. It works great on my Droid RAZR M and on my Samsung tablet. Highly recommended! More please Fantasy Flight.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game... Its Really Fun. I Play Whenever I'm Bored... I Would Recommend That You Get This App..  \\"  )
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love this game.. the best one I have found so far.. I also love that you can download more puzzles for free..
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Ok so the second book kind of dragged, like most do.  Even the first few pages of the third had me worried....but the second Half is just mind blowing.  I've read hundreds upon hundreds of books, all fantasy, and this trilogy is right at the top. Must read
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read this before the movie, it's truly an awesome book.  Glad the movie hasn't ruined it completely.  Definitely recommend to anyone who likes to read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Although the ending was as expected, a well written story line. Hard to put down.<br />I enjoy Grisham's writing. Each book is a good read
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|My wife enjoyed it and that's what counts.  She couldn't put it down once she started reading it, which says it all.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Typical for Tim Burton, loved the humor.<br />Tugs at your heart strings.<br />Would watch it again and again.<br />Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|My wife enjoyed it and that's what counts.  She couldn't put it down once she started reading it, which says it all.
0345803507|5.0|You wouldn't think a 90 year old LADY say that but I was loaned the first book and found the author very good and decided to order the next two for myself and the person who loaned me the fist one.  Good Story, Good Author and well written.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Too bad he passed away.  he did a great job bringing this character to life.  The other seasons are not as good as this one.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Good Love Story.  Good Terror Story.  Filled my weekend with a good reading experience, and a well written tale.  Just didn't like some of the twists and turns.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|Good read.  Very creative storytelling and vivid imagery.  Could not put the book down, just had to finish it and find out what happens.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I have long loved the language of flowers as a means of communication.  This interesting story makes good use of this concept, and I am pleased it is not too heavy handed.  The central family story is full of human strengths and failures, trials and triumphs.  The author creates believable characters and writes an interesting descriptive tale  .
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this book.  Better than the show.  Couldn't stop reading it and devoured the book in no time.  Must read.
B00004XP35|5.0|This album still gets constant play from me and my friends and family. Every track is golden, especially the ones that didn't make it to the radio waves. The feel throughout the album is astounding.
B008602KQI|4.0|Love triangle spiced up an otherwise classic story of good and evil.Jennifer Lawrence was great as &#34;catnip&#34; called that by Gayle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the game, but I do need to limit myself to 30 minutes a day. It's addictive, and I don't get much done if I let myself get carried away.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is one of the most greatest games that I had played in my entire life!!!!!!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I down load it and uninstalled like five times and it still won't work. Don't get this app it sucks so much. worst app ever.
1616550414|5.0|great price, fabulous service, this will make my son'e birthday! Heavy to carry, otherwise I would have bought another one.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I just love these types of games. Great story line. The puzzles were good.<br />I can not wait to play the next vertion.@
B005K17RU0|5.0|I recently moved from Michigan to Kansas, love being able to see the weather is both places.  Mostly I love that the sun is shining here in Kansas and Michigan is getting snow.  This ap is very easy to understand and set up, I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I bought this game at Amazon's for my grandson. He loves it so much, that he would play it for hours and hours if I would let him. His Papas watch him playing that he download it on his phone and on mine also. The game is a big hit.
B0012HEB32|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. Good action, story line and seemed true to the Terminator series.  It was a total bummer it was cancelled.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I think you should save your money because it needs to be updated to have every thing the computer has like minecarts or spawned eggs
B004P4S4NM|5.0|if you don't like adele..may i say you do not like people who sing..lol...her voice is astonishing..buy the whole album just to hear him beautiful effortless voice blare through..and ofcourse my favorite songs are on this album..all the famous singers of today are even blown away by her voice..no one can copy her distinct sound..love it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent Series.  The disks arrived on time and were in great condition. All played without a hitch. I would buy it again.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|i absolutely love this duet album...i especially love the one she does with frank sinatra (i've got a crush on you)and many other great collaborations..soon as a saw this album and read the songs and who she was singing with i had to get it..very endearing, truly love it.
B004DM0UII|4.0|It's very similar to Pandora. Got it as the free app of the day. These people going insane over permissions is just stupid.  No one is making you install the app, you whiney f'in nerds. Just don't use it. Simple as that. Pathetic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ghdbsbhzdhyf dddhdurh udgdheg d d e e e t r r r r r r r r r r f f<br />. D d e euryrgrugxhd dhdhdg
B004V5QWU2|4.0|I like the fact that you can choose up to 3 different sounds and set the volume level on each. I'm still experimenting with the numerous choices. Rain 2 and Chimes 2 set at 30 minutes is working well for me.
1932100660|5.0|Great read if you are into improving your health by diet. I have been Vegetarian off and on for years, this is getting me back on track.  Even the grocery store checker commented on my healthy food choices today
B004MGMJ3E|4.0|Good album but nothing like Parsons.  I guess I was so spoiled by the last one that I had really high hopes for this one.
044024630X|5.0|Can;t get enough of Reacher and his love life and daring adventures. He always winds up in the middle of trouble. Amazing how he thinks so quick on his feet and always comes out on top, with a few injuries.  I wouldn't want that many scars, but great read.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|This movie was sexy! James Spader is great in this movie. Definitely watch it! I just watched it two weeks ago and am ready to again already.
B000005GWH|5.0|First time listener but not the last time I will buy an Elliot CD.  I was looking for background music for a photo display and did not expect to fall in love but I have.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I found this book to provide good advice for 20+ yr old women starting in the work world. I plan to use it in my MBA Mgmt class for good discussions. Im wondering if men will be as anxious to \\"lean in\\" at home as much as women want to \\"lean in\\" at work?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game, fast-paced & addictive. Like the new look, looks \\"fresh\\".  I would highly recommend to very young and old alike.  Three generations in my family play this game!!!!
B00B5P37IG|3.0|great if you like religious programs, For News or other media or entertainment it is a little lame depends on what your looking for, but at 99 cents .....
B00A757EFW|3.0|this is a really awesome game but sadly only if you have the full version for $2.99 I really wish I could get it though becase it seems like a great game to play :(
B003ZSI7R2|1.0|CD defective, Great group though.Evidently the Cd was not manufactured properly. So I would not purchase this item if I had known about it's quality.
B005LAIHZY|1.0|How is this character a role model? Merida is born into the most privileged position in her society but rejects the accompanying obligations. Merida's mother clearly loves her but when Merida meets a strange witch she immediately purchases a spell that puts her mother's life in danger just to selfishly avoid her royal obligations. It is a mistake to judge the obligations of a historical social organization by what exists today. Other than skill at archery I saw nothing in Merida that was good. Merida's selfishness and lack of concern for society as a whole seem to epitomize what is wrong with people today. She is the bratty child of privilege like Paris Hilton. Did she do the right thing for her royal realm? No, she almost kills her mother to avoid doing the right thing. So if you want your children to disregard what is best for family and country and turn to witches and spells to break the rules this is the movie to teach that. How did this movie win an Oscar? I suspect many people who actually got to vote just read the positive press for the movie and never actually saw it. To actually watch all the Oscar contenders is an obligation a Merida would skip so maybe the Oscar voters see a kindred spirit. Wreck It Ralph should have won.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I didn't read The hunger Games; I just saw the movie. It left me with the desire to continue the series.  Book two continued right where the story left off.  I enjoyed it very much.  The ending leaves you ready for book three!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|The Next Day far exceeded any expectation I might have had. The CD covers a large range of emotions from true and trustful love to true and lasting suffering brought on by dark choices by oneself or others.  Each song is well executed and tremendous in style.  I enjoyed the background harmonies, especially the old school. The CD covers a full range of emotions with great depth. I felt the truth of the CD both in the David Bowie's voice and in the lyrics. The premise of the CD requires one to look back on history. Once the premise is understood, the CD is pure, solid gold.
B004IK8Q86|4.0|I like all of Maugham's books - and have read them all.  Wish I had more to read like them.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|great movie for everyone in the whole family and even friends too and it is really funny and silly movie
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I don't know if I have ever heard a singer with a more powerful voice.<br /><br />Such a soulful sound. Love her music!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a really great app. It helps me get up in the mornings when I ignore my original alarm.
B00064X3FE|5.0|I have to echo what others have said here.  The songs are fantastic and I have to admit, other than Someone Saved My Life Tonight, I was not familiar with the rest of the songs (not counting the bonus tracks) which makes listening to this SACD a refreshing treat.  Which is why I just could not bring myself to buy the SACD of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road since I had heard most of those songs so many times for so many years I just wasn't driven to pick it up.  But now that I have heard this surround mix by Greg Penny, I'll have to rethink that stance since Greg mixed Yellow Brick Road as well.  I know Greg has done other Elton SACD's, he just has to share the wealth with many more artists!<br /><br />I was very impressed with the 5.1 mix with great use of the rear surrounds, with all channels perfectly balanced throughout the sound stage.  A very open, airy mix with great separation that you only hear on the very best 5.1 SACD's. Great songs with an outstanding surround mix that shows off the full potential of the amazing high-resolution SURROUND format that is SACD.  Captain Fantastic indeed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had so many emotions reading this book, hurt, anger, sadness. At times I wanted to crawl in the same book and hug sky,holder, Karen and even six. This is an amazing story that will unfortunately hit home for so many. I am in live with this story and the characters. I love the fact that this book had an ending as well. As much a  I would love to know how these to make  it through future challenges I know that there really isn't a need for more story. Thank you for writing a wonderful story!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After reading it half way through, I had to put the book down and take a break.  Personally, I don't enjoy books like this, but, certainly others disagree with me.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Well, i think that this game was interesting enough. You have to feed the animals, catch the animals, make more animals, collect money, etc. But i like more interactive games. This only showed your whole zoo, where you press the food button when they need it and press the floating coins to collect them. There are also strange crossbreeding options, like griffons from a hawk and a lion. Oh and all the lions have manes, yet you can breed them to get new lions. When a lion has a mane that means it is a boy. However, the main reason i uninstalled this game was not just that i wanted it to be more interactive or make sense, or that i needed more room on my device. No, it was that every time i played the game i had to power down my kindle fire to close the app. When i played it the menu option disappeared and there was no exit button. So...somewhat fun, a little addictive, but in the end, not worth the time.
B00000IYWH|5.0|What more can you ask for!? This album has some great upbeat tracks. The song such a night is good enough reason to own this! The King is back!
B000092T6M|5.0|The movie, is as always, great.  The extended version is just that.  If you like the theatical version, this dvd does not give you the choice to see it.  Just FYI
B00005JKG7|5.0|Need I say more? It's a John Carpenter film. He is a genius and the pioneer of the horror slasher genre. All of the others are just wannabees! Remake his films all you want but there is only one John Carpenter. And his original films will forever stand the test of time long after the remakes are forgotten!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Wanted to read the comics because I love the show so much. It's very different, so I never know whats going to happen. I'm a book purist, so I don't think I would have liked the show as much had I read the comics first.
0061120081|5.0|I decided to purchase this book because I wanted to read some classics. Harper Lee paints a vivid and detailed view of the southern life in Alabama. The book itself gives us insight into how it was during the 30's. The storyline had me gripped, and felt as if I was there. This book is still relevant today. I had not read the book before, and was wondering what I was missing. I'm glad I read this, and would gladly recommend this as a read to a friend.

B001I45UFC|5.0|I'm so glad I chose to read the book, then rely on the movies and cartoons I watched as a child. C.S. Lewis writing style is so engaging, gets you in the story. Good series to read to your child.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I am very disappointed with the way this game works. I can't seem to get the habitats to move and stay when I do get them to move so I get frustrated and quit.  I've tried two different times and I'll give it one more try before I give up and delete the game for good. I can't find any help to let me know what I'm doing wrong if it is me. Sorry
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series continues to have me eager for more. I have really found a show I want to follow. You need to try it out!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Great adventure story. Jim is a character any youth at heart can relate to with great and incomparable ease. Boo
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Without a doubt this is the best movie of the century.  One of my top ten all time favorites.  This movie was well done and it was story which needed telling.  The drama of this story was real which made this movie my personal favorite.  While I admit it's not an easy to watch its worth watching.<br /><br />With that end view I owned the original DVD version and updated to blue ray.  I was slightly disappointed in the blue ray version.  I was expecting more stories and more data from the movie than on the DVD version.  I was also hoping to see more the stories of the survivors.  Still overall the Blue Ray version isn't bad but just lacking that more info.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is the most ausomest game also its theams the inspecter is getting me to run more and amazon cool games
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I felt it could use a lot more adult content. The locations and costumes are dead on, Sorry Ned. Looking forward to season 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very entertaining and addictive. Changing countries and adding new characters and boards along with new items etc...making sure it keeps you busy. Competing against friends on Facebook for high score is fun as well
B00AHXIC50|4.0|i love this man's voice omg! beautiful songs, you can feel the passion and you will definitely be singing along.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I loved this watch while I had it, but lost it like a dummy :(<br /><br />I had no problems with it while running, and I run in Seattle where it rains all the time.  Some people had issues with response while sweaty, but I don't really touch the screen while I'm running except to pause while stretching.<br /><br />Very good product, very accurate, and comfortable.  Did not use the heart monitor because I figure that my heart rate is up sufficiently if I am running and don't need a monitor to tell me that.  Also, it gets really sweaty and is uncomfortable while running.
B004KKX814|4.0|Ldrago is really good bey but it struggles to beat Big Bang Pegasus. It is also gray not silver,<br /><br />I still recommend it. It comes with a rip cord launcher and stickers. It is worth the money.
0525952926|4.0|I've always enjoyed novels which encompass years of history.  I would rate Follett's first book of his 20th Century Trilogy, &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;, 5 stars.  I'd rate the second,  &#34;Winter of the World&#34;,  4 stars, because of an overabundance of melodrama.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I thought I'd get sick of this story pretty fast, but for the price...... This novel is funny, interesting, a little over the top (!) and obviously written by someone who is a nerd at heart.  Thoroughly good read if a little long.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Truly enjoyed Catching Fire.  Had a hard time putting it down!  Can't wait to read the next book!  Very intense!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers! Does the game need changes?... my opinion....NO! The game is awesome. I especially love the World Tour!!
0525478817|1.0|Literary hounds will dig this book.<br />Teenage girls will adore this book.<br />Everyone else will deem it over-emotional rubbish.<br />The characters are not realistic and/or are underdeveloped.<br />It's pretentious, but it's (trying to be) literary; so, that's to be expected.<br />It felt like a failed Nicholas Spark's 'script.<br />I'd like to see what Green can do when he grows up.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I just started watching this series and I find it interesting because of the dramatic dynamics.  The main character is a cool, calm and thoughtful lawyer who has to deal with no only her clients adversity but her own personal adversity being married to a corrupt public servant who is serving time.  I would recommend this series to anyone who liked watching Revenge.
B00947N6D8|4.0|My 4 year old loves this movie, it's entertaining and fun to watch. The characters are super cute too. But the ending is a little weird, it just didn't end as well as it should have, or I would have given it a 5. I would still recommend this movie over other kids today! Good watch and kids will love it!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|If I'm upset, or in a bad mood, I get on this app. It's just so funny to see him get knocked out and stuff! Great for kids, and a game that never gets boring. Also there's a 99 cent extra download to make him do funny things! I rate 5 stars!!!!!!!!!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have watched every significant English classic series put out by the Brits and this is as good as any<br />Bronte,Austin or Hardy story.  Julian Fellows is a remarkable writer.  I applaud the  cast and story-line development. A real feast for the viewer.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|We rented this for our movie night and got some good laughs // good story that all parents can relate to
B00181JGI2|4.0|No,  really, it was funny. Loved Jeff and Steve but John Goodman is the run-away favorite. He is just perfect casting One can't go wrong with the Coen brothers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game..lots of fun and works great on my iPad, iPhone, and Kindle Fire. Some levels I play over and over again because I can't remember how I did it the first time!!!  It is challenging and addictive.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very fun and adicting but the charicters are to pricey also the backgrounds i feel they need to be more exiting and to be able to change the back<br />Ground when ever you want finally i feel that when you start the gema you start<br />With two or three diffrent prople then the outher ones get locked until you reach a certain part of the game thank you yours sincerely Victoria

B0001HAISG|4.0|This doll is exactly what I expected.  My 2 yr. old granddaughter loved it.  Her name is Sophia so she is really interested in the new Sofia princess.
B00947N6UG|3.0|Rise of the Guardians is a movie based on the characters from William Joyce's Guardians of Childhood books. In fact the movie is set many years after the books and introduces a new guardian in Jack Frost, the other four (The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Santa Claus each having been introduced in their own books).<br /><br />The movie is clearly intended for children and the guardians picked because they will be recognizable to that audience. The storyline is similarly straight forward too. The Bogeyman has a new plan that will have the worlds children stop believing in the guardians. And when that happens all that will be left is his nightmares.<br /><br />On top of that plot we have the layer of Jack Frost who has to learn who he really is and come into his own as a guardian. And again this is familiar territory, though reasonably well executed.<br /><br />Visually the movie is a treat. The character designs while not entirely faithful to the renditions in the books are clearly inspired by them. They are distinctive and full of character while being different from most other animation. The particle effects used for both Sandman, and Jack Frost are quite stunning too.<br /><br />Voicework is a mixed bag. None of it is terrible, but Alec Baldwin as Santa Claus stands out amongst the Guardians themselves and Jude law is pitch perfect as... well... Pitch (the bogeyman).<br /><br />That does leave the workmanlike script as the weakest element over all. It's not bad, but it lacks any particularly distinctive spark. From an adult perspective there are points that could really have benefited from more time. particularly the Guardians loss of powers which is very abrupt. But the running time is 97 minutes and you have to wonder if younger children would have the patience for much more than that.<br /><br />Set your expectations appropriate. This is fun and it doesn't require much in the way of concentration. It looks pretty and kids should enjoy it. Adults will know what's coming but if they can turn off the snark they can enjoy it too.l know what's coming but if they can turn off the snark they can enjoy it too.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a great app! I love the cool graphics! It is a matching game with a very interesting story.  Great Game!
B00AKGG828|3.0|Deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers: This version of \\"Running Man\\", released by Olive Films, has NO captions or subtitles whatsoever, in spite of the fact that it has been previously released (both on DVD and VHS) with captions/subtitles.<br /><br />This is a trend I'm noticing with smaller independent companies buying older titles and then releasing them on the cheap: no captions/subtitles on movies. Buyer beware.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not tear myself away from this compelling story. Katniss brought to mind other great young heroes of literature faced with immense moral dilemmas as well as just trying to survive by guts and brains. Before I finished it, I bought the next two books. They are an excellent trilogy, and I recommend it to teens and adults alike.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|One of my favorites. I have read it seversl times but never get tired of it.  One of the best classic stories.
B006ZZANDI|5.0|Super.  My granddaughter was thrilled.  I love their songs and learning about them. Best present. I have ever given. Excellent purchase.
B003DT194G|5.0|All the negative reviews of this film have clearly been written by silly young folk with no patience and very short attention spans. They'd probably also get bored with 2001, Brazil, and The Godfather. So ignore them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great horse app..my kids love it and think they are taking care of a horse of their own. can't wait for more

B003U6BE8I|5.0|Great family movie.. Fun for all ages. My family had a wonderful movie night enjoying this cute and fun filled dvd.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Ok... but inexcusably tied into the LOTR, overlong, riddled with unneeded dread and battles, and made into a LOTR retread instead of standing on its own as a fresh tale of adventure.<br /><br />My primary objection was that Jackson weighted down the story with the gloom of 'the shadow' - a growing demon threat - and inserted scenes of Frodo, Saruman, Galadriel, a villian Pale Goblin complete with extended back story, Radagast's bunny mobile and everything else that wasn't in the book.  He could have presented a leaner brighter film which was truer to the story and therefore more clever and adventurous.  How many boring unwritten orc battles do we really need?<br /><br />I thought Martin Freeman was quite good as Bilbo, and the various drawfs are distinct and well played.  The drawf song Misty Mountains was terrific, but so short.  They could have included additional verses playing over following scenes (as was done to great effect in the trailer). Ian MaKellen is always terrific, but I felt that he wasn't allowed to live the role here, but was mostly made to deliver a few deep thoughts at essential moments.  He was forced to be angry, sad, or fighting way too much.<br /><br />The riddle game with Gollum - which could have been this film's showcase - was ok but abbreviated, with half the riddles cut out and none of the suspense, and ended with Bilbo considering at long length whether or not to kill Gollum.  This unnecessary ending with the extra long look at Gollum's big sad eyes was pure audience insult.  Bilbo is the kind of creature that doesn't kill unless he absolutely has to, and it was bad enough that Jackson had Gandalf educating Bilbo on sparing lives, but far worse when the decision to dispatch Gollum was made into such a prolonged vital thing, when it was incidental in the original and far more effective as such.  Instead of being about personality and serendipity as Bilbo leap over Gollum and dashed away, we have \\"the pity of Bilbo\\" shoved down our throats.  A little more respect for the audience would have been soooooo nice.<br /><br />This film isn't an adventure story where shrewdness, luck, wizardry and happenstance win the day, it's an orc filled growl fest with hordes of vile creatures being ridiculously slain again and again by a tiny group of super fighters.  Bilbo and drawfs were never intended to be ultra commandos, but in the film Bilbo wields his sword to defend Thorin against a huge orc and warg, leading a charge against the orcs in which the drawfs beat them back.  Seriously?  Bilbo as bold sword swinging, battle ground charging, super killer?  The original story had wolves instead, and that would have been something different (yeah!), and equally or perhaps more effective, but no.... we had to get orcs.  Again.

B00884GR0W|4.0|I've never played Minecraft or any of its clones before, so my review is based in my unique experience with this game.<br /><br />The reason I've never played that game is because I knew that I was going to love it and sadly at this moment of my life, I don't have much to time to dedicate to gaming.<br />This is not a casual game, you need to dedicate time to it.<br /><br />If you have the time and dedication, it can be a wonderful experience.<br /><br />The pros:<br />- It's really fun to explore the vast world<br />- Lots of materials to collect<br />- Lots of items to craft<br />- Total liberty to redesign your surroundings<br />- Lots of quests, animals to capture and monsters.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Control can be a little twitchy for moments.<br />- It's easy to get lost, since I didn't find any map or something to guide myself<br />- Its complexity requires time to master<br />- Battles can be very hard at the beginning.<br /><br />This cons aren't really cons, except for the last one. I took out one star because of the control issues, but all of the complexity and richness of this came can be a pro for you if you have the time to learn.<br />If you are more of a casual gamer just trying to kill a couple of minutes in the line of the bank, this game could not be the right one for you
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I loved this book - can't wait for Book 2 which I understand won't be out til 2014!! have to find another series to keep me busy until then.

0425252868|4.0|This book is a page-turner and is well-written. By the end you feel like you really know the 2 pilots. It also makes you think \\"How would Americans like myself react if one of our pilots let German bombers live to fly again?\\" It's a great thought-provoking book.

0316067601|1.0|If this book was actually true and factually accurate I would rate it 5 stars. As soon as I finished it I thought it was an extremely exciting page-turner. But some of the claims in the book sounded fabricated, especially the claims about how many enemy fighters were attacking the SEALs. If you do 10 minutes of web research you'll find that the book is largely fabricated/untrue. I was very disappointed, and have the utmost respect for Navy SEALs, but I can't recommend the book due to the fabrications and errors...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|loved the movie and the book. easy to read and had no issues with the book. enjoyed it very much
0307279189|3.0|I thought this book did a great job of portraying running enthusiasts and introducing the reader to some interesting characters along the way. I would have rated it a little higher if the author didn't get distracted in some chapters that suddenly went away from the main story.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I adored this little book and its story about finding love in rural Ireland. Lydia is a lonely school teacher whose parents kept her from finding her true self.  After the death of her father, she decides it's time to \\"live a little\\".  This is difficult since she is still under the watchful eye of her controlling elderly mother.  Jaime is a lonely farmer who becomes depressed after the death of his adoptive uncle.  He turns to booze and Valium to medicate the pain of his current loneliness and the memories of the horrible abuse he suffered as a child in the orphanage.  Their friends convince Jaime and Lydia to place a lonely hearts ad in the paper and we the reader are along for the ride.  The characters are richly developed and the dialog is so well written I had an Irish accent singing in my head while reading.  The author is skilled at taking the reader from one chapter where you wince at the pain, to the next chapter where you are literally laughing out loud.  I enjoyed it so much that as soon as I finished it, I went back to the beginning and started reading it again.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was a little surprised about the Holmes and Watson's characters changing. But Lucy Lu with her balance of grace and the embodiment of an empowered woman is a great complement to Johnny Lee Miller's cerebral, slightly narcisstic character Sherlock Holmes. They show great respect in their talents for deductive reasoning and observational skills but the scripts are well written and there are slight twists and turns you don't expect. It definitely keeps my interest. I love  this series.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I bought this movie for my 11 year old son, he is die hard basketball lover and I couldn't help but swipe up this movie from my childhood. This came in perfect condition and plays with no skips .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Who doesn't love the Walking Dead? I mean really?<br />Season three focuses more on the conflicts developing between the humans rather than the zombies.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I'll keep this short because I don't normally write many reviews; although I will meekly admit that I will rarely make a purchase without reading several: this book was a great ride.  If you like epic world building focused on a central character as he (sigh...it's almost almost a he, isn't it?), learns and grows, becoming increasingly exposed to more power and magic, in the vein of Name of the Wind and even the Magician King, or dare I say it Harry Potter, then this book is for you.  Great storytelling, succinct dialogue, a main character you can bet on, and a few fun,  mostly unforeseen plot twists, then buy this book.  A great value that will satiate your need for the above.  Mr. Ryan - keep it coming!
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|Watched the first episode. Lost interest.<br />After the first season, it just wasn't interesting. Kind of knew what to expect!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Really enjoy this CD of Emmy Rossum.  She is an over looked artist brimming with talent.  Easy listening personified.  Thank you, Emmy.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is awesome because you can get people and design your car and get power ups and even get gadgets
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Hotel Transylvania is a very good movie and the whole family will enjoy it. I watched it with my 8 year old grandson and he was hypnotized by the whole movie.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I chose this book in a time of turmoil and transformation in my  own life. Somewhere between the cover and the last words, I found comfort and strength in the story of a girl who had also strayed. The humility of growth and the ability to keep walking found in every step of her journey has given me hope. Read this book, it's worth every tear.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Stark portrayal of one man's fight with himself and the devastating effects of alcoholism--profession takes a front seat in this movie.
0525951652|5.0|I bought this book for my iPad  because it is so big to carry around almost 1000 pages. Reading it on my iPad also afforded me the luxury to highlight a word I didn't know and have it defined for me on the spot. I loved that. Ken Follett is not only a superb writer, but you learn history while you are enjoying the story. A forward tells you how he intertwines history and fiction. I loved it and highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it's the bomb if you have not downloaded this game you need to peace
B008476HBM|4.0|Book was for my daughter - for school - everything was fine with the purchase word word word word word
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was great! Everyone in our office read this at the same time.  You never knew what Christian would come up w/ next.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Each episode is good! Can't wait to watch Season 2! I love to watch episode after episode!<br />Keep them coming.
B004GYY714|4.0|There are times where the station I listen to just stops streaming, Sky FM - 80 greatest hist would have to be my fav station by far!
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Always a classic. I was 5 when I first discovered the fantastically plucky Princess Elizabeth. I have YET to think this is \\"kids' stuff\\"!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|GREAT READ IT KEPT ME GOING TO THE END TO KNOW THE UNKNOW AND I WAS IN A RUSH TO FINISH IT FOR THE STORY WAS SO GREAT
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit. The movie is wonderful, but does have some major flaws. The largest problem is the writers liberties and how much is added to the movie. For crying out loud, the book was smaller than the Fellowship of the Ring, why on Earth would you want to make it into a trilogy? The movie is much longer than it has to be but the story line is still good. I admit that the added scenes and added characters at first made me a little aggravated, but at least it kept me focused. I recommend it for all Tolkien fans.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|So I can read it again and again.  Love it, I can't wait for the next book(s).  Great job Mr. Ryan!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Watched it on a plane trip late at night, so I was tired, but it kept me awake and attentive through the whole thing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author did a wonderful job capturing me with the first few chapters. I felt some of the story was a little unbelievable and kinda crazy. The author had me until about the middle of the book and completely lost me at the end. I read this for a book club and it certainly worked well for that- lots to talk about! Interesting read for sure!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Great for elementary aged children.  The levels are challenging enough that my 4yo can't quite get them and asks for help, but between my 7yo and myself we can unlock the levels.  It is a bit tough getting used to the idea of only controlling the left and right movement, but is good for learning patience and timing to get the right amount of bounce for some obstacles.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Was recommended to me by Kris Holden-Ried. Can't thank him enough; I haven't enjoyed a CD this much in years. If you love folk or country music you will totally enjoy this CD. Easy listening music you can relate to!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|i love this game its so fun i barely go on anything else i listen to i heart radio while playing you should get this game if you didn't get it now plus i could give it these adjectives: fantastic, great, amazing, awesome, and free.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Fun but eventually you NEED acorns to progress. Not worth the $$$ it costs. But fun prior to all that.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I wanted to read the book by Max Brooks before the movie came out, and I have to say I am VERY glad I did. I doubt the movie will be true to the style which is a uniquely refreshing narrative style that provides you with various perspectives of the &#34;World War Z&#34; events. I enjoyed the introductions to each narrative, setting the stage for what we could expect to hear. I also enjoyed that the book went to the international level and did not stay focused on one country.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great read for both the stories and the style in which they are told.
B00B2166BS|5.0|My Nexus 10 charges so fast with this cable. Totally worth the price. Only thing that would be better is a dock with this built in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally addicted to the app. It's amazing. The only thing is that I can't figure out how to update it!  But other than that this app rocks
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is cool because you can build stuff. BUT I hope there is an upgrade soon, because the computer one looks cool.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Progress is intentionally slow as to encourage you to spend money on upgrades. There is nothing wrong with that, I suppose. However, I find the gameplay a bit frustrating and haven't been convinced that spending money is worth it.
B000XFCPHI|4.0|Love the music.  If you like the movie all the songs from the movie are on the sound track.  Love
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|It was somewhat interesting. I figured the killer long before the protagonist did. The strangest thing is the title, as no murder occurs on the Cote D'azur at all. Why call it that? I enjoyed Maggie wandering around Paris, but was annoyed by the stereotype of the rude Parisian. I've been to France a couple times and never encountered rudeness. There's an interesting twist near the end, two really. But then in the epilogue the author acts as if one of the twists never happened, resulting in a conversation that makes no sense at all. I'm not sorry I read it, but I doubt I'll read anymore.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I saw the movie and thought it was funny as hell.  All the songs they had in the movie is on the soundtrack.  While watching the movie I knew I had to have the sound track.
B001AK3S4Y|4.0|I didn't know if I would like it or not but, the graphic's are great!! We enjoy watching the action scene's.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great read! Well written! Very satisfying!! I'll look to download more books from the series and continue the adventures of Jon Perry.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|The graphic's and action scene's are great. We love watching movies in their consecutive order and it was great. Keep them coming.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I love this movie. I believe that it shows so many aspects of going through high school. The positives and negatives, which are also real life scenarios not just things teenagers fantasize about. I liked that the relationship between Charlie and Sam was low key and that the whole movie didn't revolve around a love story. All of the actors did outstanding. Truly one of my favorite movies.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I had never heard of the 1970s American musician Rodriguez before watching this movie, and was mesmerized by his popularity in South Africa under apartheid and by what the musicologists discovered about his life. One of the best movies I've seen in years!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|works as well as it does on my PC.<br />Only draw back is the amount of space it takes up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how each month the background and themes change.  My grandson introduced me to this game who is 10. I like when me and my 4 yr. old granddaughter play together and the different characters we are earning points to get.
B00340O3KQ|5.0|Since the prince and the pauper, this is a storytelling staple. Both actors give solidly villainous performances in this two foisted fantasy tale of modern mayhem. Very entertaining.
0307271862|2.0|I have had this book a very long time. I have tried time after time after time to read it and appreciate it. No dice. The opening scenes were captivating and promised a mystery worthy of some late night page turning. The promise of a horrific crime scene needing answers and explanations and a story that would take us to China and back.... should have been a winner. I just could not suspend my disblief for ridiculous coincidences and then came the drudgery. Politics, politics, and MORE politics. Recitations of speeches and oh, yeah, more politics. I have not finished this book becuase I just did not care anymore about any of the characters or the original mystery. It's a shame because I know folks who love every word ever written by Henning Mankell. The Man From Bejing was a disappointment.
B00A83075M|5.0|This movie is great for all video game fans. I happen to be a video game fan myself. My cousin is also a video game. It has a lot of video game characters in it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so much fun, it's really good for horse lovers to. I would know, I'm a horse lover also. I recommend getting this  game.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This was one of my first games and I loved it from the start!! I recommended this game to all my friends!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|An awesome book gets better and better its great even 6 years in the making, Greg is getting more older, cant wait for when number 8 releases this fall
B003I55BIA|5.0|I love this book so much it is romantic romantic I couldn't stop<br />reading it I rate this book 5 stars this is my favorite book ever
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to listen to this and again feel the genius driving the late Jimi Hendrix. This collection was not a more of the same, different day type release. I have thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It all about Julie B. Jones is scared to go to school cause it was her first day and Julie didn't know anything. The teacher tells all about Julie and information the teacher said.  Julie you are going to ride on bus 9029 for the rest of the year  Julie felt a bit  swallowed a gulp of spit. and that was the worst how it happened she picture no  kids all around the bus and a mean girl named  Jackson and she stuck on the smelly bus and so Julie B. Jones is stuck forever!!!!!!!!
B00BSBXZDY|3.0|a little over the top with the story line<br />4 year old loved it<br />6 year old lost interest<br />good fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game it's so entertaining black black black can you send me some coins I want to buy new girl d Chang fgh
B0046B3QTG|5.0|4 year old to adult can enjoy this movie<br />not scary<br />very well written and out together<br />will watch again when the grand kids come back
B008602KQI|5.0|When this movie was all the buzz, I just ignored it. Since it was on Amazon primate I figured I'd give it a look. The beginning is a bit slow as they are developing the characters, and some of the outfits just look science fiction cheesy, but it keeps picking up and getting better and better. I loved the ending and look forward to the sequels.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I thought the book was great.I assume this is the beginning of a new series.I hope so because Puller is a great character. Sarah. D. Campbell
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very well written post apocalypse story. Descriptive without being overly verbose, nice character mix and progression. For anyone considering it I believe Wool Part One is still available for free.
B0090SI460|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. Shipping was fast and was a great value. I completely recommend this movie too anyone with little children.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|The Radiohead is my favorite group. They make my favorite music and I will always listen to Radiohead.I love it.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It's been some years since I read the book so I'm not really sure if it stayed with the book. I do like how the same characters that are in the Lord of the Rings are in this too. I highly recommend this movie!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I only play this when I have nothing better to do, but this is a fun game that I play with my friends and family
B006P96PAO|5.0|This film is an outstanding presentation of the importance of Fatherhood in our society, and it makes a strong challenge to the viewer in the context of Christian morals and Biblical principles to step up and take your Fatherhood seriously.<br /><br />Watching this with my 14 year old son was one of the most significant bonding experiences I can recall.  We were both deeply affected by the film.  I recommend it highly.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|he likes to build and solve problems and while it is not an educational toy, it is a game I am not worried about my children playing and it has some problem solving involved.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Daniel Day Lewis did a very good job portraying Lincoln, but I hadn't realized the time span and subject the movie focused on was so limited, so I was disappointed that it encompassed only a very short period in his presidency.  I would have liked to have learned more.  And the fact that it was directed by Steven Spielberg made it even more disappointing for me.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|we haven't completed all the levels yet like the original angry birds but we are on our way.  The violence of the game is mild and suitable for most children.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Interesting story line and a fast paced read. The author does a great job entwining the life's of the characters.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it could be better but its ok I guess like most things you cant get without gems. that really Sucks
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Good so far.. multiple characters easy gameplay ... fun to play and quick upgrades. Not too much crazy cash shopping in beginning at least
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Shame that great shows like this one cant run the whole year long.  The next six months are going to suck with out it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show! It is so addicting, I watched the entire season in one night!! I can't wait to watch season 3!
B00947N6D8|2.0|I can't believe the other reviews for this movie. Santa with tattoos and swords? The Easter Bunny with a personality disorder? The animation is barely better than Polar Express, the story is weak, the dialogue is even weaker - so much so that it requires constant background music to fill in the otherwise awkward lines. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that my kids didn't hate it as much as I did. There are SO many better animated and kids movies out there, why waste money on this drivel?
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Comparing the Website to the app, The website definitely has the advantage. But for quickly looking up reviews, this works perfectly for that. It is a solid app that gives you the information you need. I would recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing! Didn't want to put  it down! Moments where you piece it together as you read and and moments that leave you having no other option than to keep reading until you find out. Powerful book that is beautifully written.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|Could not put this story down!  The movie was horrible compared to the book.  Was sad when the book was over!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|What a wonderful to get your writing in Print! I gave it 4 stars because of the transitional appearances of your work. Even after I read the guidelines, it still looked choppy and ill prepared (in the Kindle Cloud). If I had spent the time to thoroughly understand the instructions, I am sure it would look better. When I post my second book, it will be spot on.<br />DrC
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is creative worlds with creative mode and survival mode. very fun and addicting. but... it rodent have everything that id on the Pc. that's why I gave it 4 stars.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, intuitive, with nice big numbers.  If you aren't a mathematician, you won't need anything else. And the price--you can't find better!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|A must have for any one who loves dinosaurs and fancies themselves a mad scientist. I've had no problems, the app has performed very well.
B0055SWM08|2.0|Like the subject line suggests, this game is OK.  I bought it because the rating was very high.  I've only played it for an hour or so, but it's already pretty repetitive.  Great visuals, interesting concept, I was just expecting more.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game, New levels with update. Great graphics. Wish they changed the items you have to find in each room every once in a while.
0440245931|3.0|Two US Supreme Court justices are murdered on the same night, and Darby Shaw, a law student in New Orleans, comes up with an off-the-wall theory about why.  It turns out she's right, and her life is now at stake because of what she knows.  First, it's really hard to believe that a law student could solve the mystery of the justices' deaths when apparently no other legal mind in the country is able to do so.  Second, not much really happens here.  Darby flees after her professor is killed and dodges some assassins.  These must be the most ineffective assassins in literary history because they really have no idea what they're doing.  Gray Grantham, a reporter in Washington, DC learns of the White House's involvement in the plot against the justices because a custodian finds a memo discussing the situation and gives it to him.  Seriously, what kind of White House official would be dumb enough to throw out such a memo like ordinary scrap paper?  As is the story didn't have enough problems already, there's a contrived romance that blossoms toward the end. Grisham's main problem is that he is able to come up with thrilling plot ideas, but is not so good on execution.
0345803507|3.0|after reading all three books i must say im kind of glad they are over with.. i started off liking christin grey but as the story progress especially in the third book, he just became controling and abusive. i would have liked the story better if ana actually stood up for herself. every problem they have never gets resolved.. they just have sex to get over it. i wont spoil the story too much but something big happens to ana and christin curses her out and blames her.. its crazy.. the one good thing i can say about this book is that there is more plot development. in the other books it was mostly sex but at least in this one u get somewhat of an interesting twist. even though its predictable it was still interesting to read.. but honestly ive read far more steamer sex books out there with more action. ana started getting annoying when she always thought someone was out to get her man. He treats her like shes 5. i wish she would have left him at one point and thats saying alot. the ending was good but too cliche for me considering how she lets him run over her the whole book. if u want a good book with steamy romance try nicole jordan, jude deveraux, johana lindsey. now they have really good books!
0596009208|2.0|I bought this book in preparation of taking a Java course. I thought it would be good to have a second resource to help me during the class assignments. However, it was virtually useless. I think it helped me twice, if that. It's not for beginners; it doesn't present the information in a clear and organized way. I felt it emphasized being amusing over informative. What I really disliked is the index lacked a lot of terms and functions. Want to learn about a vector? Well, have fun searching for it in the book because it's not listed in the index. I had programming experience from a course on C++, though didn't fully grasp it at the time. I would imagine those who have never programmed before would be even more lost. Save yourself the money and look for something else because you'll just end up using Google to find answers you need. I've never used another Head First book, but I wouldn't bother after purchasing this.
B00985E3UG|5.0|The cover of this books tell us that it will not be bland reading, and the book lives up to that promise.  Truth be told, I knew much of the information that was in this book before I read it, but I learned quite a bit too.  If you're interested in knowing how you and your family is being affected/manipulated by the major players in the food industry, it's enjoyable reading.<br /><br />The writing style is dramatic. Starting out with &#34;Minneapolis was having a blustery spring evening on April 8, 1999, when a long line of town cars and taxis pulled up to the office complex on South 6th Street and discharged their well-dressed passengers. These eleven men were the heads of America's largest food companies. Among them, they controlled seven hundred thousand employees and $280 billion in annual sales.  And even before their sumptuous dinner was served, they would be charting a course for their industry for their industry for years to come.&#34;<br /><br />It's a well researched, well-edited book, a  21st Century version of Adele Davis' Let's Get Well.  I highlighted over 100 passages.  I read the book in three days, even though I was also reading other work.<br /><br />It's well worth the money, and I am pleased that I bought a Kindle edition. This let me switch between reading and listening, which I did while working out at the gym and on my commute to/from work.
B009KEN87O|4.0|This game is awesome except for when you get to zone four it starts to glitch a lot. But for what it is ,it well worth it.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|It was a little hard to continue through the author's long descriptions, observations and personal opinions, but perhaps that was his style and/or he felt it necessary to the points he wanted to put across. Overall I enjoyed the story with its many profound insights.
B000HZGNDG|5.0|kept my attention the story is relateable and an interesting movie overall. i enjoyed this startrek movie alot and its also humourous
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|Can wait to watch it again.  The characters and scenery are overwhelming.  Hugh Jackman makes a great Valjean and does his predecessors proud.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We watched this movie Easter Sunday and it was good for the family.  Theme was love and peace with self.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Love that christian bale and batman triumps again, great plot and action<br />Nice ending as usual leaves the story line open
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Little money well spent. It's sleek and to the point. Very happy with the dollar for return margin. Not kid prof but for a adult its perfect.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This movie was one of the best I portrayals of AL that I have ever seen. The only complaint, is that there was alot of GD's the curse word, which does not seem historically accurate. These individuals were educated, or at least many of them, and it is out of character for these great men of America and God, would have such limited vocabulary. Daniel Day Lewis was the best actor to play AL and he is one of the greatest actors of all time. Sally Field was also great as Mary Todd, gosh I have not seen acting like this since Kings Speech. EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|One of my favorite series; interesting case every time; interesting characters and character development; strong writing. It's addictive once you begin, but worth beginning with Season One.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Keeps you entertained and isn't over hard or easy.  Allows you to move up without having to quit your job or invest tons of money.  Fun for the normal gamer.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It's fast and challenges your. Everyone enjoys at our house.Even grandma plays. For all ages.
1863514201|5.0|I have completed two of the projects and am getting the hang of it. It is more artistic and expressive than cross stitch - appeals to all artists who have been used to fine arts and want to try something new.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games  I have ever played and the most fun I can't stop playing it!If you like temple run you'll like this game :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game to play. visiting friends horses is a nice extra. doesn't require real money to be able to play &amp; complete tasks.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|It's magic please get this app. It is the best I find all my music and its very helpful in daily life and let's me preview the songs!
1401941893|4.0|This was a nice, easy to read and relatable book, and should be a good read for young women learning to accept themselves for who they are.  It had questions at the end of each chapter that make you stop and think, evaluate your life, and re-think how you work through situations.<br />Just reading through this gives me a good feeling, a positive attitude and makes me feel better about myself.<br />I think every young girl could benefit from reading this book.  Its filled with inspiration, and the things in this book could be helpful and empowering.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Got this for a free app on Kindle Fire. Incredible fun. I'm a big fan of Mario Kart and while this doesn't have the &quot;combat&quot; element of that game, the time challenges and constantly changing racing terrain keeps it different each time I play. My kids love it too and the controls are very easy to pick up. Nicely done Vector Unit as this rivals most big platform racing games!
B000286RKW|5.0|Some may disagree, but I think it's Scorsese's best film. Easily one of the best American films ever made no doubt. I was pleased w/ most of extras and commentary, especially by Henry Hill and Ed Mcdonald the DA who played himself in the film.<br /><br />I have to agree w/one of the prior reviewers critique of WB's DVD packaging of this brilliant, classic. Despite the fact this, and the Blu-ray, have some nice offerings, this film deserves better, more impeccable treatment. But, in many ways it mirrors the way Hollywood at large has treated Scorsese. He's never quite fully gotten the respect he deserves.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Plenty of adventure and excitement kept returning the pages. Can't wait to read the rest and hopefully discover Jade & Clary are not siblings.
B004N66XYE|5.0|Purchased both seasons of this continuing story of '165' while I am waiting for the next season of Downton Abby.  I have never seen the original series so I was not certain if jumping in now would be confusing, but it is not, the story does a nice job of looping back to explain any references to the original series making it easy on viewers like me.  I cannot compare this series to the original, but that might be a good thing, allowing this series to stand on its own merits.  The characters are easy to warm up to, and the story line moves along at a nice pace.  This is proving to be a nice filler and I am going to be sorry to see it end so quickly.  If you are looking for some enjoyable viewing similar to Downton then you will most likely find this series fits the bill nicely.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book and a great end to the series. Well written. Ties everything up nicely. Wish there were more and can't wait for the next movie!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Once again, I purchased this DVD while waiting for my next Downton Abby fix.  It is only a short series but well worth viewing.  The story line moved along nicely, the characters were well done and I found it engaging.  Not a complicated or involved drama, but still it managed to keep me captivated.  Sorry that it was not longer.  I had also purchased the &#34;Lark Rise&#34; series and did not finish that as it was too much like watching the British version of Little House on the Prairie, but North & South had a more adult story line that I found entertaining.  If you are looking for some light, but enjoyable summer viewing while you wait for the Downton saga to continue, give North & South a try, I believe you will be pleased.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire has always been a favorite of mine, so to be able to take with me is very cool. Thanks.
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|Didn't realize the action and language were so rough. Knew it was a little rough, but not as bad as it is. Story line is interesting but not sure I will watch any more episodes.
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|I rented this in HD and had very poor results with quality....was very disappointed but the movie I did like

B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing and very original. If it was possible I would give it six stars.<br /><br />P.S. ,Rick Riordan`s books are amazing.
0307959856|4.0|this was a nice sequel to the jane austin pride and prejudice book, but for those avid fans of jane austin beware, all the characters do not convert from the original story. this story is a nice mystery of who killed captain denny. it keeps the character of mr wickham as a shady ner do well. No one is very worried about the fact that wickham is arrested for a murder he did not commit. The final twists and turns are a bit hard to sort out as the &#34;real story&#34; of what happened that night has 4 or 5 different versions. I wished for more interaction between mr darcy and elizabeth, but alas, the action of the story works to keep them apart. The book is well written and keeps one's interest. i would recommend it to a friend.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book introduced Jack Reacher through giving an impression of him rather than trying to explain to explain too much about him. I'm definitely excited to read the next one in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you love running games then I bet you will love this one<br /><br />This is the most fun game ever<br /><br />I love it<br /><br />I love this game it is the most important game to me I recommend that you play subways surfers  this game is so much fun for kids and adults

B004EWEX9Y|3.0|I decided to buy this cable to watch Netflix on my hotel room TV while traveling. Unable to wait for shipping, I bought the product directly from an Apple Store. I was disappointed to learn that my IPhone 4 would not recognize the cable on any of the 3 TVs I tried it on. I power cycled the phone, upgraded the firmware, tried different Apps, etc. Nothing worked.<br /><br />Frustrated, after returning home I took it to the Apple Genius bar where they confirmed they cable was defective on their phone and TV as well. A free replacement cable worked fine.<br /><br />In the end it worked out, but when I pay a price premium for a genuine apple product I expect not only a premium level of customer service (which I got), but also a premium level of quality control in their manufacturing process so I don't need their great customer service. Reading other's reviews it seems my problem was not unique.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Enjoyed this game very much until the expansion cost went through the roof. Hard to keep going when it takes at least 10 million coins to expand AND than after reaching at least level 37, I lost everything.  Getting no support from Gameloft.
B0064QNS62|1.0|It's difficult to look at the screen and buttons at the same time. I figured that because i like old games i would like this, but i don't. It's like the whole game is too slow or something. At least it was free when i got it cuz if it was like $.99, it would be a ripoff.
B005AKFXZW|2.0|This story begins in an interesting enough manner but doesn't seem to go anywhere - at least it takes too long for anything to happen and I lost interest in about the middle and put the book down.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This book takes a little muscling through at the beginning because there are so many story arcs, but it is totally worth it! Martin's writing is just the right combination of suspenseful, passionate, and elegant. Read them all!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a tale about young people in contemporary society who are afflicted with cancer and who nevertheless live each day to the fullest. It will appeal to all age groups because it is well-written and full of wisdom. I recommend this book.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I have watched Batman movies and tv shows since I was a kid and I really enjoy the whole story of Batman. My personal favorite was the original movie from 1989. Once I saw the Dark Knight, I can allow room for another favorite. This Blu-Ray trilogy is the best way to watch all of the Christian Bale Batman movies. He is a great actor and did a very good job at portraying not only Batman but Bruce Wayne. This trilogy starts off a bit forgettable with Batman Begins. Its good, don't get me wrong but the trilogy shines with the next two movies. The Dark Knight sets the standard for not just acting, with Heath Ledger's Joker, but also in terms of the scale of some of the action scenes. Many were done with as little CGI as possible. You get goose bumps watching some of the scenes.The last movie in the trilogy is the same just even better. Bane is a brutal person. Not quite as memorizing as the Joker but easily one of the best villains.<br /><br />If you like or love Batman there really is no reason not to own this trilogy. There are plenty of extra features and content to watch and review but its all about the movies. You won't be disappointed if you get this Blu-Ray.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|great bond movie. Daniel craig is a great 007. One of the better bonds, but if you're a bond fan, I guess there are no bad bond movies.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Absolutely a fantastic 2 disc album. All the great hits are here. Truly is The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac !
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am an avid fan of Lee Child's Reacher books and have loved every one he's written.  I read some of the negative reviews on Amazon, but decided to buy it anyway, assuming that I'd like it as much as the others.  Unfortunately, they were right.  The plot IS convoluted, not believable and overall, the story is dull. For the first time ever, I put it down and wasn't that eager to get right back into it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played In my whole career of playing video games and I play alot of video games
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I spent hours swimmin around on this time waster. They update the game and my save file is completely lost I'm pissed

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|My mom thinks Hugh Jackman is a real stud- me not so much, but the movie is still awesome! Great weekend action flick.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As a sequel this book is good enough to stand on its own.<br />This is another book to recommend to my reading friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was romantic how Christian loved Anastasia  in his own psychotic way.  He was abused as a child which lead into his adult life causing him to become a dominant in his everyday life.  Anastasia was not able to show him how to love on the first book.  I now have to read book two and three to find about this twisted love duo.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I'm not going to go into what these movies are. I'm taking it on faith that you know the deal. So let's get to it.<br />The four classics (Yes even the bad ones, humor me ok? lol) along with Returns look and sound great. There are multiple extras ranging from all the standard making of stuff to some early Superman cartoons.<br />Now for my only gripe about the set. When I opened it the discs weren't marked. With the exception of Returns and the bonus disc, all they have on them is a pic of Christopher Reeve. Normally  that's not worth mentioning but there are two versions of the first two movies. Four's disc is on top of three You're basically flying blind when you choose. Luckily the extended cut of 1 and the Donner cut(the versions I like) were on top. Don't do like I did and say \\"Oooooh the Superman set! And I can afford it!\\" Do the research and make sure the labels are indeed marked like in the picture.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|We love the movie and we were so glad you had it for us to buy.  Yes, we would definately recommend it to others.
0307946711|4.0|I recently came across the movie \\"One Day,\\" which is about a male and female character who don't-quite-get-together at college graduation. The story then follows this friendship (and leaning toward more...) for 18 years.<br /><br />My first thought was \\"Same Time Next Year\\" (remember that movie?). And it's true that \\"One Day\\" has a similar theme, although perhaps a little more gritty and realistic (based in England).<br /><br />The problem is that the storyline was hard to follow, jumping from one year to the next. The scenes often felt like they weren't complete - that the director or writer had to rush it to meet time constraints.<br /><br />But I was intrigued enough that I decided to read the book and see how it compared.<br /><br />My first comment is this: out of all the millions of books that could become decent films, why try to force this one into a movie format? The passage of time and the incomplete scenes (the reader has to fill in the blanks) make this movie extremely difficult to pull off. It was an admirable effort (the actors in particular had much challenge and I have to hand it to them), but didn't quite make it, in my opinion. Had I not gone on to read the book, this movie would not have been worth the time to write this blog post.<br /><br />The book was SO much more, SO much better.<br /><br />If you like stories about best friends falling in love (a theme in my book Last Chance Rescue), you'd like One Day. Although it sure takes a while! There was one point where I got a little impatient (\\"can't they see it?!\\") but for the most part, the twists and turns each characters' lives took kept me in it for the long haul.<br /><br />These are twists and turns and personal growth/development that you feel in your gut are honest, that could happen in real life. And the final twist...well, I didn't see that coming (and I won't give it away here). It's not a happy ending, but not a thorough tear-jerker Nicholas Sparks-type ending either.<br /><br />In fact, the story of Dexter and Emma was so good, I even overlooked my biggest pet peeve. Namely, that the point-of-view could switch at a moment's notice. (Yep, even from paragraph to paragraph, which normally drives me batty). It could even swing to the point of view of a tiny bit player - for example, a waitress at a bar, a forgettable character. But at least that character made observations that added to their story (which was, actually, a bit necessary, since the above-mentioned \\"shorting\\" of scenes was in fact part of the written novel).<br /><br />At any rate, the novel was a pleasant surprise. I think I subconsciously expected not to finish it based on the movie! I loved the characters (well, I didn't LOVE Dexter for part of the book, but that was the point).
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Two day shipping was terrific. But before I opened the plastic wrap, I saw it had previously been opened since the Back of the Booklet was cut as with a cutter. And each disc was not tight in the sleeve, it seemed as if the discs had been previously taken out. Never had this experience with Amazon before.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|Shameful Horrendous Inept Trash!<br />Must be the worst ever movie remake from a TV series since the creation of celluloid.<br />R.I.P. Dark Shadows (THIS VERSION ONLY)
B003XVYLDU|4.0|The book hooks you with gruesome originality.  I appreciate the status this book received, and regret not reading it earlier.  Then again, I would have hated it prior to my master's degree.  It takes some intellectual seasoning and some solid failures in life to empathize with Billy`s frozen time, bizarre ideology, and cynicism.  I especially like the conversation with the General come historian, I feel I have met that man several times, even in the mirror once or twice.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|I wanted to see this before GI Joe 2.  This one was way better.  Some good action scenes, good quick laughs & awesome characters.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I have had zero issues with this app. And I absolutely love it. No matter what I am in the mood to listen to, I can find it. And I love the feature to remember favorite songs and to be alerted when they are playing
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|This cd/dvd is a must own for Richard Marx fans. You can truly feel Richard's soul singing when he sings his songs. He is one of the few artists today that when you hear songs by them you're brought to a different place. He needs to get back in the limelight, but I think he enjoys flying below radar and releasing music that he knows his fans will love and doesn't have to be loved by the mass pop. Keep it up Richard Marx.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm addicted to this show. The characters are vivid and engaging. The storyline is always full of surprises. It's commentary on the early 20th century has induced me to learn more about this incredible time in history.
B0087EACJK|5.0|This game starts out easily enough and then progressively gets more tricky. You also have a time to beat which adds to the challenge. I enjoy games that make me think but don't make my brain hurt! So far this one is a keeper.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|This was a good book, But I will say it did leave me still wanting more from the story, As a final book it was a cliff hanger. I find myself still needing to know where everyone ends up. But it was still a good book Just left me unsatisfied.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|With every Depeche Mode release, comes comparisons to one previous album or another.  I'd say Delta Machine could be a bridge between Violator and Songs of Faith & Devotion- as if the band had recorded a secret album around 1991-92.  The dark, minimal electronica of Violator is present here, but with hints of the rock & soul that was about to come.  The bluesy spirituality of \\"Heaven\\" certainly evokes  1993's \\"Condemnation\\".  \\"Slow\\" is a slowed-down, sexed-up remake of \\"I Feel You.\\"  This album might lack the obvious hooks of those 2 fan favorites, but what DM lack in hooks here they compensate for with atmosphere, sex appeal, and intensity.  It's hard to imagine any Depeche Mode fan finding much fault with this one.<br /><br />On the other hand, the album cover is atrocious!  Sorry, Anton Corbijn, but it's just ugly.  The smeared, blood-red photo of some sort of industrial building does nothing to add to the mental image of the album.  It's unattractive and not worthy of a Depeche album.  Yuck.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Sure gives a person a lot to think about.  Even non-believers could be made believers in life after death upon reading this true story of a doctor and his personal experience.
B00633W614|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It sure kept me in suspense. I didn't like the ending because it left you hanging. I told my sister she had to read it. But I didn't tell her about the ending
0893860220|5.0|Outstanding and inspirational.  I recommend this book to<br />all spiritual seekers.  People from all over the world came<br />to ask questions of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.
B00BJS7104|3.0|I'm pretty much outraged that for 15 bucks I can only watch this in HD on a Kindle or streaming to my PS3...  I want to watch movies on my PC and will be looking for a more reliable source without wierd contract clauses.  To top it off, even though they indicated I could  at least watch in SD, even the SD version is not downloading to my stupid Unbox player (Which I just use to download the video so I can watch it in a better media player).<br /><br />Lost a customer amazon!
B00A4OALL0|3.0|Wayne is still on the same route that John Coltrane took back in the 60s & 70s - more acrobatics, less music
B009JNXK88|5.0|I love this game a little challenge and fast paced. However, it has a glitch with the spinning spikes. Sometimes if you step on it but don't touch the spike, it still kills you. But only SOMETIMES.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Seems like a simple enough game, but is addictive and challenging without being too difficult. Love it for killing time!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the characters were so believable. I have not seen the movie but doubt it is as good as the book.<br />Mental illness is just not very understood in our culture.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best book of the series so far. Couldn't believe what happened- and then happened again! Can't wait to read the next one.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I keep getting too bored to finish it so as of yet I sm still not done. I am not sure I like the pace or where the story rambles.
B004JK61K0|5.0|works fine with my century link email system, took a while to port it though and the rest is easy
1444737112|5.0|So inspiring!  I loved this book.  I believe &#34;the americanization of BOB&#34; with be released this summer but I wanted to read the English version. Great decision. The English version captures all the nuances of London's street people. It is the story of two lost souls, a recovering drug addict and a big Ginger Tom Cat ,and how they came together and changed each others lives. It's serious, it's funny, it's sad. Above all, it's the story about a proud, homeless cat, a man desperate to save himself from the ravages of drugs and how, in the end, they saved each other and became celebrated darlings of London!  GREAT STORY--I want more about BOB and JAMES!!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Interesting but unsatisfied with the ending ,- did the author just run out of ideas on how to tie this up
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. It is so soothing and lovely I never get tired of listening to this CD.  Andrea Bocelli is magnificent!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really awesome and fun and it's great for kids and me and my friend verse each other slot and this game is addicting
B00B69UQEO|1.0|You've not released a good album since 1993!<br /><br />Crappola after crappola is what each new release is. Lame, lame, lame.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked this book when it first started...the way it changes up between chapters was interesting. The book changes quickly and I began to hate all the characters...no one has any redeeming qualities. Horrible ending.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love Grisham books-and this one lived up to his reputation.<br />Can't wait for the next one!  They are always good!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Downloaded it for I love the 100 floors, these are great and keep you guessing and using your mind to figure it all out. it is a wonderful brain exercise. to keep your brain feed and healthy , it is a very intelligent well made game all of them like these, are the best. need more of them with walk through's for when you get stuck.

B0058W74UY|3.0|Have it on my pc. love it, but haven't had to use it yet on my kindle fire yet, plan to use it for videos, and much more. won't go wrong with using it.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|It takes a good picture. I can keep all my photos here or transfer them to my computer. THank you
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would recommend buying this if you have space to.It takes about gig . Also it wasn't what I thought it would be. But I  learned to like it and I am grateful I did.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Wonderful, a place to keep all the videos and all that are all over the world that we can have fun watching
0920668372|5.0|I have given each of my sons a copy of this little book, and shared a number of them with others. Great Little Book with A Great Big Message of Love!!!!
B002APU580|5.0|The best version and the best representation of a Jane Austin classic. I can watch this movie over & over again & never get bored with it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good fast paced. I loved the writer. I knew the book would be better than the movie. Four stars because it left me hanging, now I need to get the next book, and read the whole series.<br />I would recommend it to everyone
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was happy to git this game I tryed it out and I said to myself that I love the game we shood get it on my compuder I think I wood love to but it is so a good game I want our state to be like minecraft so badly. Minecraft is the popper game in the world.who made this game I love it
B009EP3DJM|5.0|My friend is a fan of ke$ha and he really liked this. I auto ripped it via amazon and I think the whole album is good.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Having recorded some of my earliest sessions at Sound City in the very early 70's this movie brings back memories and shows the real inside stuff in LA studios. It was a great room with a great sound and a great vibe.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Friend has a birthday coming up, she's a fan of katy perry. Bam, she's very happy now. I got the other version for myself
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series. It is romantic, funny at sometimes, and action packed with secrets laced in every suspenseful page
B009P5S11G|5.0|My friend says she really likes this album. So I auto ripped It and I have to say its good. I really like Diamonds
B007Y2W44W|3.0|It's a good CD, nothing more. The drummer is awesome. Didn't like the sound- it's &#34;basement&#34; style, sort of muffled...
0399226907|5.0|I remember this from school and got this for my niece! It's a classic for childhood books. Hope you all like it
B007WFR1TE|3.0|I do like the music but I feel I was kinda tricked, cause they went for electronic music and didn't use a drummer, so had I known, I wouldn't have supported it by buying the CD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great! I am already addicted! there isn't anything I would change. the details are perfect and the so are the graphics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazingly cool people have to buy this and the best part is that it is free and no hassle to upgrade I'm 12 years old and I love this game
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I use this app for my job. Rather than carrying around heavy paper documents for auditing, I load them on my tablet PC and use ezPDF Reader to highlight them, add notes, and organize them. The search function allows me to find things much faster than thumbing through paper documents. It's a very functional, user freindly product.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive I love it!!! It was the first game I got on my kindle fire! It is awesome!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game because you can get different people and boards and you can get keys to save you and you can get mystery box's that have keys in and trophies but you could get hover boards
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Its always relaxing and captivating when you find a game apps, that challenges you. I really enjoy playing fruit ninja.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The app works fairly well with the respect that it is free.  I have two weather apps that I use and between the two, this one is probably the best.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I was able to access a clear, bright and excited facebook. All information was accessed with and open with ease.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a fun app to pass the time, especially if you have to travel with small children. I let my son play this when I need to get things done.
B005HSL626|4.0|Its always relaxing and captivating when you find a game apps, that challenges you. I really enjoy playing fruit ninja.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT is the best possible game for anyone who likes Temple Run. This game is great for kids too. I LOVE IT!!!!!!
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|2013-04-06
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics, great puzzles, loved the story. I loved  how the hints worked, you didn't have to wait for it to recharge. I would recommend this game to my friends!!! Excellent!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The protagonist seemed to have a teenager's vocabulary and propensity for unnecessary profanity. So much so that I won't be recommending it because many in my neck of the woods would be too put off by that to enjoy the story. I am however looking forward to more from Andy Weir and hope that he can see this as a personal observation and not a criticism. In my personal experience by the time someone earns a doctorate they aren't left with a lack of vocabulary but as a veteran I know that it also takes great effort to keep a civil tongue in times of stress because the harangue of boot camp and the many times of having &#34;my butt chewed&#34; during a superiors moment of displeasure still bounce around in my memory several decades later.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Amazing game for kids definitely need update real soon<br /> And add new monsters with for<br />the new update and new places
B00A77II0U|5.0|I purchased this game for my pc years ago. I enjoyed it then. It's great to now have it on my kindle. I recommend anyone who enjoys hidden object games with a good story with them to get this game.
B005LAIHCM|3.0|There was nothing \\"wrong\\" with this movie, but I get the impression most of the people who are giving it 5 stars and saying it was \\"edge of your seat suspense\\" and \\"chilling\\" are younger viewers.<br /><br />Anybody over age 30 has probably seen this same story at least half a dozen times by now.<br /><br />I would have probably given it another star if I had not heard so much praise for the film beforehand.<br /><br />But the movie did not live up to the hype.<br /><br />It was pretty much a \\"by the numbers\\" horror film that borrows very, very, very heavily from the Grand-daddy of horror films that started this whole Genre ---  PSYCHO<br /><br />No real twists, pretty much what you expect and are waiting for from beginning to end.<br /><br />So certainly not bad, but not the \\"masterpiece of suspense that will keep you from sleeping\\" that so many proclaimed it to be.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an easy fun game. You can buy horses with gems I love this app<br />I hope you get it
0345404475|5.0|The film did not copy it exactly, so there is still surprise as you read the book. And it is a very good book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really fun & it's addicting. I love playing the game whether I'm bored or I plan to do it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a wonderful book. I have read it about 3 times now and I love each and every time.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This is one of the few remaining good solid shows left on tv, if not the only one. I love the horror genre but this show doesn't really limit itself to being simply just horror, though the zombies are quite scary when they see brains and get hungrier. I love how this show feels so real. I love how it makes me feel a little on edge to watch it and I find myself holding my breath during the intense scenes when a zombie may potentially jump out at someone. I think it helps that it is set in some small Georgia towns that had already in many ways been devastated by the political, financial and societal apocalypse that has virtually ravaged our country of late. Sadly, it's every man for himself here- a theme on the show that parallels real world life. The characters all have such depth that it is interesting and exciting to see who's going to be introduced in the story next. I do get sad when they kill off characters but I guess that goes with \\"keeping it real.\\" While I did find some actions of the group or individuals to be frustrating in their lack of good judgment, I do think the writers have managed to keep the characters real as much as possible. The special effects on this show are also amazing- nothing I've seen yet in the show's three seasons has looked fake to me. I also love that on this show I don't have to be subjected to graphic sex scenes that make me cringe. I hope this show continues on and I look forward most eagerly to season four... wish it would hurry up and get here!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I played the entire game then reset it so I could play again. The storyline makes this the most fun match three game I have played
B001MBK3T4|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made by this band.. Its a classic and a must for your DIO years collection
B005LAIII0|5.0|All the hype! Story about faith! Computer generated gimmicks! Boring!<br /><br />Well, I went to my son's at Easter (He usually shows some after-dinner action flick with car chases.), he started his Blu-Ray, and \\"The Life of Pi\\" was emblazoned across his giant screen. I thought well, guess I'm stuck watching it. Within five minutes I was caught, spellbound, not only by the stunning beauty of the visual images but also by the flawless portrayals of the actors who were so natural that they didn't seem to be acting. Almost unawares I was so swept up with the story that I easily suspended my disbelief and was very close to tears at the utter beauty of what I was seeing. \\"The Life of Pi\\" is a cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />Of many scenes of magnificent beauty, the one in which the golden sky blended into the sea simply blew me away. The film is so astonishing that I quickly forgot my bias against CGI.<br /><br />And I didn't mind the two endings. Whether the more prosaic version was the truth or not is irrelevant. For me, it provided a framework for the layered symbolism of the 'romantic' narrative.<br /><br />Ang Li's visual motifs are reminiscent of the verbal motifs of Greek tragedy. They penetrate deeply into the psychology of the characters. The blurring of the boundaries between illusion and reality--the very ambiguity of 'what actually happened'--makes me want to watch the picture over and over, as there is so much to savour.<br /><br />Happily, my son gave me the DVD as an Easter present!
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|This is a fun-filled partying cd. The songs are filled with fun songs about sunshine, drinking, and fallin' in love! I love Luke Bryan. His voice is hot and this new cd is a fun one to listen to.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app includes all information you need to know about the capacity of you battery.  the animation is cute.  enjoy it very much.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy the game and storyline as well as the levels. I think diamonds could be acquired more easily. but overall its very fun.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|I enjoyed how this movie bridged the mystical with the scientific. I believe it is a timeless classic. It is interesting how rigid forms of thinking can leave so little opportunity for discovery. How much more could be realized from an open curious frame of mind?
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app works like majic it awesome i can play with mily pics all the time. I can do about anything i want to
B00AREIAI8|5.0|excellent game for horse lover's. my daughter. and I love it. would recommend to friends. so very happy I came accross this app. love it

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great story. Definitely worth reading and I would recommend it to my friends, but it is not Nicholas Sparks's best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game. Can't say I've encounted a better slow to fast pace app before. Got my recommendation for sure I guess.
B00992CF6W|5.0|of course xbox and pc is more advanced,  but this game is awesome to play where ever you go.. he graphics are also outstanding
B002APU580|5.0|What can I say I love this movie, If you want to watch a wonderful Love story that leaves you wanting more this one is mine I would love to find a love such as this as most women would agree
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I threw out my old alarm clock with the shrieking buzzer alarm now that I have this app. It has some nice sound options to wake to, though I do wish there were a few more. Set up was easy,and great not to have to remember to turn on every day. You have the option to program it for weekdays only which is so convenient. Also, good to travel with. Just remember to plug it in if you're using your kindle fire as it sucks up battery life fast.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry Goodkind has well developed plot lines and characters.  There are nights I will stay up late just to see what is going to happen next.  A little bit of sleep deprivation is well worth it.  I would recommend all the books in the series.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I like this game, it is fun and you should really get it if you are one of those people who likes to play a sort of &quot;tower defence&quot; kind of game.  you should especially get it if you like multiplayer and if you liked the last &quot;SAMURAI VS&quot; game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great APP , I love that I can put in multiple locations and save them so can check my favorite locations any time I wish , it gives good information and is fast any one who wants to keep up on the weather current or future would be very satisfied with this I think it's more accurate then the T.V. weather forecast .
B00A11AN6O|4.0|The more I read about it and find out new things...such as I can use it on my computer ....I am sure it will be a 5 star.<br />Its me that needs to dig deeper..
B0037QM8YA|5.0|It Was Very Sad But Very Good And Told A Story How Many Kids Today Get Bullyed And It Needs To Stop!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very fun and has lots to do. they help you so you know what you should do to have a successful horse.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|We had ordered all three seasons and all went smoothly until the last disc of season three. I don't know if this happened during shipping or packing but there was a crack in the last disc that made it unplayable. Thinking that everything had gone smoothly, I had thrown away the packing/return slip. I have learned my lesson and that will not happen again. Disappointing for this to happen.
B004132HZS|5.0|we love the new twist on this show adding a modern edge. we're big Sherlock Holmes fans and caught this original on the BBC and just had to buy this. quick delivery and good quality DVD.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I DON'T understand  this  book .  It's the only thing that the kindle fire comes with besides a dictionary of definitions. :( terrible job  ! I am not looking forward to reading more of the stupid book:(
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|its a real good game and i injoy playing this game my sister really like this game too thank u
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Fantastic show! Well worth the purchase. Being a reader of the books and a lover of the show, I plan on buying each season as it comes out.
B00A8KJN14|4.0|Thsi was a gift to a 9 year old girl.  Since she asked for it, I am assuming that she and her siblings enjoyed it.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I read this book almost straight-through. I was captivated by the bringing to life of the thoughts people harbour and the peek into their motivations. I look forward to Rowling`s next endeavour into adult fiction.
0930289234|4.0|As an foreign, I thought Watchmen very challenging to read. It have a fantastic plot and a great art, but the vocabulary make it very tought to read but it completely worth the effort
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was one of the best experience of my live It was a mind blowing game and every1 should get it it is totally free & it was the greatest game of my life.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Fun movie, adults will enjoy recognizing the 80's console game characters.  My husband and I rented this and watched it by ourselves and laughed out loud, alot!
0761169431|5.0|My son checked this out from the school library and I thought he needs his own.  The book comes with special star wars origami paper.  These papers really make your project gorgeous.  My son is 11, he loves star wars and we did all the yoda, chewbacca darth paper and they were fun, this takes origami and star wars to a whole new level.  The instructions are for the most part easy to follow.  Our book came with two of each kind of project paper.  It has provided us a lot of entertainment and after the origami figures were made the empire and the rebel alliance faced offs, complete with the millennium falcon and x wing fighters.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Hate to sound like a professional reviewer, but this Follett is almost as good a read as Pillars of The Earth. The characters are vivid and absorbing, coupled with the intertwining, overlapping plot lines, make it a page turner. Do not start to read it unless you can devote an hour to it. Do not read at bed time...as you will not fall asleep but want to push on to find what happens next.
0062202081|5.0|My niece is a fan and I got this for her as a Christmas gift. She was so excited when she realized what was in the package.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoy Ken Follett's writing. I have liked his work ever since I read the Pillars of the Earth. I think that now I like Winter of the World even better. I read it in record time (for me) and I have recommended it to all of my friends who are telling me that they love it, too. Do purchase this book. You won't be disappointed. You will live the period before, during and after WW II. You will be there at Pearl Harbor, at the Manhattan Project, at the first efforts by Hitler's &#34;:Brownshirts&#34; to take over Germany. You will see (from Follett's perspective, at least) why it all happened.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so freaking awesome. I mean really who would have ever thought a game called Subway Surfers would be this sweet. Oh yeah, I did, that's why I got it. Keep it up app people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great it is great fun and you can buy loads of characters and items which makes the game more interesting. You can collect items while playing to unlock characters which makes the game more exciting. This game is addictive and I Love it!!!!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was well worth the small fee.  I solved it in a few days of playing rather addictively.  The normal mode gives you a hint option which helps avoid getting too frustrated.  Even with the hints, though, it provided a good level of challenge.  I look forward to their next game!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I decided to get this app after reading some of the reviews and boy am I glad.  What a simple fun app for little ones.  I am hoping it will convince my autistic son that going to the doctor is not bad which is quite a feet.  So far he just likes the app.  Really cute and I love how easy it is to navigate.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is the very best battery life apps on the market and its free. It always lets you know how your battery life is. Everyone should get this app.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey series.  I had missed the last episode and watched it online.  I only wish the new season would be shown sooner.  It is hard to wait!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Me and my 7y.o. love this game. The challenges and rewards give us something to strive for with each game and the updates to different cities offer. New sites and obstacles. Great fun
B001XJEKGC|4.0|Madison Square Garden, 2009:  the lineup features Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Ian Thomas (drummer extraordinaire), Willie Weeks (bass) and Chris Stainton (keyboards).......an imaginative pairing of two of 70's Rock Icons and a very capable ensemble playing blended cuts of their hits....no egos here as Eric and Steve match guitar riffs, solos and duets as if they have always been together! The audio tracks are superb as is the video and was delighted to hear Steve play the Hammond organ as well as his signature piano!  Here's several of my favorite songs:<br />  \\"Them Changes\\"- great rendition of the Buddy Miles classic<br />  \\"Forever Man\\" - superb harmonies with Eric and Steve<br />  \\"Glad\\"-my personal FAVORITE, the staple Traffic anthem with searing lead by Mr.Clapton and incredible piano by Mr. Winwood<br />  \\"Double Trouble\\"- Claptonesque blues on tap!<br />  \\"Ramblin on My Mind\\"- the great Robert Johnson song features Eric's acoustical artistry<br />  \\"Georgia on My Mind\\"- (props to Mr. Charles) Steve Winwood sings his heart out<br />  \\"Voodoo Chile\\"- wake up Jimi and Stevie Ray, Eric's here!<br />  \\"\\"Can't Find my Way Home\\"- take a bow, Mr Winwood!<br />  \\"Cocaine\\"- guilty as charged, can't get ENOUGH....intoxicating!!!!<br />  All in all a wonderful compilation of music and outstanding performers (watch Ian on drums--how can he have this much FUN and get paid for it!) Rock on!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I can't even begin to describe how good this movie is.  Anything I type will not do this movie justice.  It's a pure action flick with minor themes of morality sewn in.  Stop what you're doing and start watching this flick. It's a must watch for any action fan.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves this game and he plays it all the time, he really enjoys it even though he knows nothing about Star Wars at all.<br />He plays it more than all the other Angry Bird games, I don't think those birds should be angry anymore they are being played with all the time.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|i just have to say that this wos the best book OF ALL TIME and those who disagree are simply wrong

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy this game! I think that the only complaint I have is that the flowers are a bit complicated to match up, otherwise, it's wonderful.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Awesome movie... didn't like the way it ended, because it looks like there is going to be another movie.  I wanted more, lol
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the greatest run style game I've ever played. Hate to say it but, better than temple run. Love the updates. Loved the Easter egg stuff. Can't wait to see what's in store.
B00BBQXUYK|4.0|Not exactly what I was expecting, which was a pleasant surprise.  a most excellent movie for any time of the year
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I played it for a while but didn't really understand the fascination with this game. I wasn't spooked by Slenderman. It was actually rather boring since you are just running around. Slowly. Keep in mind, this is my first Slenderman game, so I might be missing something. I just didn't get it. I am giving one extra star because I thought the 3D graphics were pretty good.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this workout at the end of January 2013. I do it about 5 times per week and lost 15 pounds. I stick mostly to level 1 because my brain is now trained to put me in hypnosis after the first circuit! (I do not like exercising...). I rub my knees with a little menthol oil after each workout as I can feel them and want to prevent inflammation.<br /><br />This is the only workout that makes me look forward to the jumping jacks (to catch my breath!)<br /><br />The big pros are the price and the fact that for only 20 minutes per day, nobody can find an excuse strong enough not to do it.<br /><br />Than you Jillian<br />P.s. I am over forty and after having four kids thought that it was not possible to get back in shape because of our slower metabolism. Myth busted!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love this game! The gameplay is quite fluid and challenging. There are just so many options and I like how it seems to tap into the fun of science in order to play it. You are a ball in a ball-eat-ball universe. Don't be the ball who is eaten, be the ball that is eating. You move around by kicking off matter, and you find smaller balls to eat. However, you shrink by moving around, so don't overdo it, or a target that you thought was smaller could turn around and be bigger, thus eating your ball. So much fun and hours of gameplay!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome very very very very cool and awesome and stuff like that my horse has bunny ears it is cool
B00942X8PY|5.0|The graphics are simple and it only takes a short time to figure out how to play, despite its lack of instructions. I really enjoyed the challenge and how it worked my brain. It is such a simple game, but the puzzles are challenging and have you thinking before you begin, and even when you make a mistake. I enjoy these types of games and if you like puzzles that have you thinking in a spacial aspect, then I think you'll like it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first when I got this game, I thought it was some temple run knockoff, but when I actually started playing it, I could seriously not stop. It's fun and exciting, I love the concept of spray painting a train and trying to flee from the guard. And it's fresh and exciting, every month they change the location of the train yard. This game is addicting and can keep you entertained for hours, you have to get this game!!! You'll be sorry if you don't!!!
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This reminds me of putting together my sprinkler system. You want to direct gas (I think of it as water) to certain locations without any leaks. So you do have to think spacially in order to solve this, and those are sometimes my more favorite games. It starts of very easy but gets more and more challenging as you play. It kept me entertained for a while and I feel like I got my 99 cents out of it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a really fun game to play.  I like how it is in a new city every month.  What I don't like are the adds.  Every time I try to do something,an add pops up.  They should make a $1 version of the game with no adds instead of a free game with adds.
B00B9DTZWG|5.0|The series is wonderful and since I don't have cable, I had a marathon.  There were a couple of break-up freezes on Year 2 & 3 but was able to fast forward through them.  They were small. I am looking orward the season 4.

B007REV4YI|5.0|I saw this in the theatre and had to buy it! Although this movie is darker than previous Bond films, it pays homage to the whole Bond catalog, in honor of the 50th anniversary of Dr. No. The action is top-notch and the characters all have obvious weaknesses and flaws that drive the plot. It is a little sad to say goodbye to Judi Dench, but the movie leaves the genre with a firm foundation to launch many more films.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|They only give you fifteen minutes to play the games witch by the way sucks cause you can't even build a big house or anything and plus if the time was unlimited then yeah it would be an awesome game and yes I'm a minecraft freak!!!!!!!!!so this game kinda sucks it would be awesome if the time was unlimited and oh yeah is right and who's with us?!!

0143034901|5.0|I have always believed that a book finds you, if it wants you to read it. I think that happens to most of us - to the reader who waits patiently for the book to come along and take him or her on a ride that cannot be forgotten. Two people and very different people at that told me to read, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\". I had the book in my possession, however had not read it till then. I always wanted to, but did not. I guess my time had to come on its own. I had to wait for the book and it has been a wait worth it like no other.<br /><br />\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Carlos Ruiz Zafon is everything you expect from a well-written book. The plot makes you turn the pages. The sentences and language make you fall in love with the writer's thought process. The characters make you connect with them at all levels of human emotions and more than anything else, this book is about love for literature and reading, and not letting the written word die.<br /><br />The book is about the search of a boy, Daniel Sempere for the truth about the fate of Julian Carax, the author of a mystery novel (also named The Shadow of the Wind). Daniel adopts the book when his father, a bibliophile and a bookseller takes him to the metaphorical (or real) Cemetery of Forgotten Books and it is there that he owns the book and gets embroiled in its author's life. He sets out to search for more books written by him and to know what happened to him. In all of this, he learns of someone who is named after one of Carax's characters and has set out to burn every single copy of Carax's books and will not stop at anything. Daniel gets involved with him as well and the story thickens. It is one tale after another, intertwined and encompassing the length and breadth of great storytelling, till the reader with bated breath reaches the end of the book. The book is about Barcelona's deepest and darkest secret that is about to be revealed, which of course the reader has to discover for himself or herself.<br /><br />Zafon's characters are haunting and well thought after. He is the master of mood setting. Every page speaks of scenes with mists, clouds, evenings, darkness, the pale lamplight, thunder, rain and Zafon brilliantly so makes the reader a part of his atmosphere and setting, so much so that I actually thought I was living all of it in Barcelona (where the story is set). Zafon speaks of books like living beings, which I also think they are and he makes them real for the readers in his book. To a very large extent, the book is extraordinary because of the way the author is treating every word - with great caution and love. When this happens in a book, it is but natural that the reader will also read every word with great love and joy.<br /><br />With reference to the setting, which is Barcelona before the Spanish Civil War, Zafon talks of politics and life with great passion and almost wants the reader to know how important the setting is to the story. Books about books have always fascinated me and this was also one of those reads. It is very difficult to classify \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" in one genre and yet to a large extent I think the book belongs to Literary Fiction as it covers almost every aspect of life and living. There is courage, intrigue, love, fairy tale quality, Goth, redemption, politics, love, hate, passion and almost every other emotion and characteristic that you can think of in the book. The quality of writing, the old school setting, the power of storytelling, the characters and the plot, all come together and speak of books and reading and the love for them. I could go on and on about this book and the writing, but you know what I mean when I say: Read this book soon or let it find you the way it found me.Zafon's characters are haunting and well thought after.

1594487154|3.0|This book seems &#34;stretched out&#34; with lots of fillers and not much &#34;beef&#34;.  His conversational writing style made it an easy read, but I don't feel like I'll retain much.  Billed as a sales book for the non sales salesperson, which I certainly am, it still seemed superficial.
B005N95JA4|5.0|Awesome album. Other than Exile on Main Street, this album is their best as far as I am concerned. Beast of Burden is still the best song by the Rolling Stones ever.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Overall, this game is a lot of fun.  The gameplay is good and the graphics are excellent.  I like the mix of puzzle-solving and hand/eye coordination: Getting through the levels is mostly about figuring out the right sequence and timing of switch changes but sometimes you have to be really quick to execute the plan.<br /><br />However, there are a few annoyances that prevent me from giving this 5 stars.  First, there are two levels where it's impossible to get a 3-star score: Industrial Era 24 and Farwest Era 9.  Second, the levels don't consistently increase in difficulty.  Things generally get harder but there are easy levels mixed in randomly and the hardest level in each era is rarely the last one.  I was also expecting part 2 of each era to be a continuation of part 1 (i.e. harder).  Instead, when you move to part 2, you go back to super-easy levels at first and build back up to hard ones.  If they fixed these issues this would be a solid 5-star game.
B007Y56JDQ|3.0|I have been a Richard Marx fan since he first emerged on the scene.  There was a Richard Marx concert entitled &#34;Hold On To The Nights&#34; which was released only on VHS, and unfortunately never on CD,  It including mostly songs from his first CD, but it is a much better concert.  It also had appearance by Fee Waybill, Randy Meisner, and Timothy B. Schmit.  Also, his road band included the then almost unknown David Koz on saxophone and keyboards,  This is the type of concert I was hoping for.  However, if you are a Richard Marx fan, you will probably have the same option that I have, it is average.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|This is a Great read!<br /> Can't wait for her next one. This would be a great beach book. I loved it.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Mosley makes the supporting science easy to understand and the practical, down-to-earth guidelines simple to incorporate into most any lifestyle.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As I got hooked on Season 1, so am I hooked on season 2. Will be anxiously awaiting the chance to watch season 3.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Characterization, attention to detail, sheer beauty and wonderment!  But the two chase scenes were a LEEETLE too long, although it must be said that they looked GREAT and the goblin chase had some clever (although anachronistic) touches.  All hail &#34;The Hobbit!&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|As a mom of teens, I was reluctant to read this book, but was so glad I did. Despite the pall of a fatal illness hanging over, I could still feel the excitement of young love. I just liked the main characters so much...they both had a cute sense of humor despite their circumstances. Glad it ended where it did instead of where I expected it to. Would highly recommend this to adults, as well as teens. Reminds you to live in the moment and appreciate the simple things in life.
0143143492|5.0|This is Tolle's deepest and most &#34;intellectual&#34; work to date.  I recommend you read it after The Power of Now, not before.  I loved it and continue to listen to it again and again in my car.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so cool. It gives u tons of versions to choose from, u get to read other people's amazing notes, and the daily  verses are so uplifting. I can't say enough good things about this app. God tells me to write and publish notes that are in his own words. It's amazing!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I loved it. All I could about was how it was going to end. And the way I wanted it to end.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I simply didn't like it....I like games that I can relate to somewhat.  Maybe it was because I had no talent in playing this game.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|loved this movie! it was funny and exciting! first time seeing the movie, awesome, great, funny loved it! buy it!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a very helpful and useful sight.  I enjoy especially saving money and the homemade cleaners are awesome!<br />Recipes ideas are fantastic....many are simple and time-saving, which is always a plus.<br />Household hints and remedies are very helpful.<br />The only negative thing going for me with pinterest, is that I can spend way too much time there.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|A very intelligent, light horror film. The true star of the movie is the relationship between the two leads. Recommended.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|This is the most fun, lightest of all of the Star Trek movies and the fourth. It's humorous dialog keeps it moving and helps one to overlook any technical flaws (which any serious trekkie would do anyway). The scene on the bus and in front of the yellow pages ad are but a few examples.<br /><br />This fine example of Leonard Nimoy's directing abilities is recommended to anyone and can be watched by all but the really uptight as it could almost have a &#34;G&#34; rating.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|If you like Rush you must have this video. I was please that it was filmed in my hometown in Cleveland Ohio.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Pros:<br />-Good feel<br />-nice lightning<br />-Weight tuning<br />-lots of programmable buttons<br />-customizable light color<br />-looks very nice<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Left click button was very flimsy<br />-made sounds when i moved it around (clicky annoying sounds)<br />-middle button on the side broken<br />-glitchy macroing<br />-had to go download software from site.<br /><br />I returned this because of the flimsy left click and the middle button on the side broken.  I was reallyexcited for this mouse due to 190/210 reviews were 5 stars, but it was broken when I got it.  It disappointed me greatly.  I was expecting to be a pro gamer with this new mouse, but my luck was bad. I was one of the 10% that had issues.  I was tracking the package the whole time until it came.  Anyways, good mouse, bad luck with me.  Im sure if it didnt have the flimsy left click and middle side button broken, it would be amazing.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Anker sent me a new one and it works really well.  No problems now, and if i hadnt gotten the first one broken then this would get 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool game I love it so much I find it funny how a day guy chases me and  just love the game
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have been a big fan from the beginning.  Like the characters who have grown and changed from season to season while still remaining &#34;who they are&#34;.  The humor is fun and not mean.<br />I find myself laughing with the characters and the situation they get themselves into and not at them or someone else.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|I am a Joseph & Joseph fan now.  I need a 'see through' crock to put them in, the colors are bright and look nice on the counter.

0307959856|3.0|This was interesting to read and had some brilliant moments, but if you are looking for that magical Austen experience, don't expect that.  A nice diversion for a few evenings!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a great free app that is available on most devices. There is always a new theme and a new character to get. There are also power ups that can get upgraded.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun game. I think there should have been some more things like the eggs thank you
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Acting is teriffic. Period clothing, history of time frame captured perfectly. The program exhibits the pressure for change while safe guarding the way of life in England on film for all to see,understand and analize.
1881273377|5.0|This information has changed my life. I highly recommend it and a MUST read for married couples. Not many books I would recommend other than this one!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was reading Bossypants on my Kindle(which was great as it can be read in the sun!), I was sitting out on our oceanfront campsite & laughing out loud!  Since I was by myself at the time I feared that the passers by would call the Paddy Wagon ( not sure they have them any more, or insane asylums for that matter)
B008602KQI|4.0|Saw it in the movies but teen daughter wanted to watch it with me again. It kept her interested! :)
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater. Love it on DVD. The DVD menu offers the theatrical and extended versions. Like being able to choose which I would like to watch.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Love this company. Love their products. Love this case. Love the color and the color series and that I can change the frame. That being said it is also a VERY sturdy case that stays on very well and provides awesome protection. In addition I have the incredible Glas t Slim so I know the front is protected!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|The dancing is awesome to watch. The lead actress is horrible. Cranky face the WHOLE time. Not cool that the regular DVD does not have the full dances like the BlueRay does.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|Another map program I could not figure out.  This one has a few instructions but I just didn't get it.  I couldn't zero in on the countries that I want to see.  I un-installed it.
0425252868|5.0|A great story of enemy airmen who understood and carried out the old philosophy of aerial combat.  Read and learn more about non-Nazi airmen of the Luftwaffe
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What a useful app this is.  The calculator takes up the entire screen, making it very easy on the eyes.  It is very easy to use.  This thing simplifies my life as I don't have to take along a calculator when traveling.  Good job!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is a very good app that help with telling me how much battery life I have on my KF... you can pick the Colorado of the battery liquid... over all I really like it, it also not slow at all.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Both versions (original and remake) are enjoyable to watch.  The original is .... (not) shockingly just wonderful. Not a description most would associate with a vamp flic? If you can recall a vampire movie where you wanted to hug and protect the blood sucker, then please let me know. The ending is....  predictably beautiful
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|This is a beautiful recording. Kaufmann sings an interesting range of selections from Wagner operas, from the seldom heard Rienzi and through the Sigmund and Siegfried of the Ring, Tannhauser and Lohengrin. His voice is beautiful, the conductor and the orchestra are very good. It is a CD well worth owning
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|easy listening to music, he can be funny at times too but especially love Halleluiah song, glad I bought it
B00A655N8I|3.0|Some of the singing is wonderful. The direction is idiosyncratic, hard to understand. There are many much better recordings of this magnificent opera. (Although, to hear Jonas Kaufman sing Sigmund is almost worth the price.)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is awesome.  Gives amazing information, very detailed. Have not had one issue since I installed it on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I am referring it to everyone I know.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was impressed and pleased that an expert such as Dr. Alexander would be willing to share a life-changing experience from his lofty and scientific point of view.  He is joined by other experts in their field, and this helps to debunk the criticisms of earlier writers who were brave enough to expose themselves to an incredulous world.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Game is all right, not really what I was expecting, but the kids love it, so not for adults so much.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The story was true and needed to be shared.  I appreciated but wondered how Jaycee had been able to achieve so much ability as to write a book and do some of the other things she reported in her story.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Game is fun to play, not quite like the real pinball, but does good for playing on a Kindle, thanks.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie is so BEAUTIFUL. My only regret is that I should have bought the entire series of Elizabeth Gaskill Collection. It would have been cheaper. I bought The North and South and I say this DVD is for keep. I rate it better than the Pride and Prejudice BBC Series. The production of North and South is excellent .The casting  and cinematography is just so beautiful And of course the leading actors is perfect. I don't want to repeat the same rave of admirations written by others and I agree with them 100% . The last chapter I must have seen at least 20X , I might as well use it for my screen saver.Richard Armitage is so gorgeous and sweet and Daniela Dendby Ashe is so beautiful- both their acting is superb. This movie is better than Pride and prejudice and I love it as well. I will bring down Colin Firth one notch down  against Richard Armitage. Mr Thornton is hot and passionate. Mr Darby is a bit too cool and cautious . But , of course Sandy Welch ( The person responsible for Screenplay) took the liberty to update the romantic scene in the train station and bring it to modern day . This is a proof that a movie can be made beautifully without violence and nudity. Very  classy movie.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|awesome, thanks for the cd I really am enjoying this so much. The service was very  fast and it was like opening a x-mas day gift.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I'm really disappointed with this headset it has given me nothing but problems.<br /><br />Let me start with the basics<br /><br />+ Audio quality is good no problems here<br />+ Software is decent and voice morphing is funny<br />+ Bass is great at this price point<br />+ Microphone quality is exceptional<br /><br />The biggest flaws:<br /><br />- Build quality is flimsy I read the box and it says it uses military grade aluminum, this headset is the cheapest feeling peripheral I have ever used period.<br />The swivels are a horrible design they swivel so easily that I have to awkwardly hold them so they don't slam against the pivot and cause cracking. If you buy this headset you better be damn careful with it I don't expect this thing to last a year before the swivel cracks or the headband snaps.<br /><br />- Driver issues, I constantly loose audio to anything flash related (Flash is completely up to date as well as the Logitech drivers) when using this headset still trying to find a solution to end it. I have all the volume settings turned up, looked into flash player settings and have looked into windows playback device settings nothing has worked so far and I'm running the latest driver software from Logitech 8.45.88 as of March 2013<br /><br />- Disgusting smell inside ear cups which is not Body odor from me. Its seriously putrid smelling I can be fresh out of the shower wear the headset for 1 hour and have them on my chest and they want to make me puke, I think its the material that the cushions are made out of but I had to mention it I dont have that smell on any of my other headsets which I tend to wear twice as long as I do with Logitech G930.<br /><br />Mainly bought this headset for gaming and Youtube video watching so this issue is a huge deal breaker.<br /><br />If I could find a solution to my audio not working on flash (even pausing videos and resuming will sometimes cause the audio to be missing refreshing the page won't even fix the problem) I wouldrate this product a 4 star.<br /><br />If anybody does have a solution please feel free to let me know.<br /><br />***Operating System in use: Windows 7 64bit SP 1***
0547258305|3.0|In terms of writing, thoughtfulness, and characterization Graceling is a 5-star book.  In terms of sheer entertainment for me it's 2-star, so I've compromised with 3.5 stars.  Cashore spends a lot of time shaping the personalities and motivations of her characters, which I really appreciate; they're well-rounded and complex.  But the plot moves achingly slowly, and the author is not as adept with action scenes as she is with character development. I also don't entirely buy the characters' emotional lives; perhaps because the main character is so emotionally stunted, I found it difficult to relate.<br /><br />In general I found the book vaguely depressing.  Although good triumphs over evil in the end, the pervasiveness of evil was unpleasant - it was perhaps realistic, but I don't read fiction to relive the real world.
B001TW69J4|5.0|I like great musicianship but I'm not a huge fan of musicians that overplay to show off. These guys overplay everything but they don't seem to be showing off. Instead, their overplaying seems to create something new and interesting.
B000QUCNXG|4.0|It was a monologue, but very intriguing.  The ending was ambiguous and all in our book club had differing interpretations.  Really good to get a Pakistani view of New York and the UsA

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am not sure why I had no interest in this, but one day decided to watch the first season and I was hooked with the first episode.<br />Love all the characters! Production design is outstanding, everything from costumes to makeup, directing and editing...all has me riveted with every moment and scene. I am addicted and happy to admit it!
B0049U4NQO|5.0|A great ending to a great series. It was rather sad though( sorry for spoilers!) :-/ =) =(  ;)  -_-
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I lived through this and am married to a Canadian, who along with his family would not let me forget that the Canadians saved 6 American.  Now the truth is out and it was presented so well.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|The app is very well done.  The puzzles require a combination of logic and quick reactions ... I really enjoy games with the former, not so much the latter, which is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|I can see why it got the Best Movie Oscar. The performances -- especially Affleck, Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin -- were outstanding.  Even though I knew what happened in the end, because It's a true story, I was still in suspense as the events unfolded and even shed a few tears at the outcome. I think that's what a move is supposed to do, that is, draw you in and make you feel a part of the story, emotions and all.  In memory of Roger Ebert, I give it two thumbs up!
B00BIEYI14|5.0|GIBBS IS THE BEST...favorite show..plz dont ever stop! The whole formate is amazing and instant video is great can download them from PC or ROKU and watch on iPad or iphone!!!

B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It's fast moving and fun to while away the hours with. I would recommen it
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a very unpredictable story with twists and turns. I would recommend this book to people who like action, adventure and suspense. This book was the best book I have  read by far.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun Game. Takes a little time to get started but great for hand eye cordination. I would definatley recomed this.
B008OHV4PG|4.0|I've been a Neil Young fan for decades, so of course I had to buy this DVD when it came out. It was interesting, interspersing interviews with live music. Overall, the DVD is well done. The only thing about the music is that he appears to be playing rarities and unknown songs (from new albums? covers?), which is fine, but I wish he had played more of his classics or lessor known gems from albums in the 1990s. I would recommend to any Young fan, I doubt you'll be disappointed.
1564029654|5.0|This is a great story about three owl, Sara, Percy and Bill.  A great shower gift for my niece's baby shower.
B008O69SZ0|4.0|I've only listened to it a few times but so far I really like it. The album rocks! Good melodies, and Hunter's voice is still distinctive.
0307352153|3.0|The author presents a case for the acceptance of two different personalities - the extravert and the introvert.  More important, she attempts to demonstrate that society needs its &#34;nerds&#34; and quiet people as much as they need the &#34;bright and cheery salespeople&#34; of the world.
B000EOUSJU|4.0|This album was released after Mott hit their peak and shortly before Ian Hunter left. The album is not quite as good as the 1973 Mott with All the Way to Memphis, but it is solid. I sort of like the punk/glam side of Mott better, whereas this is more 1950s rockabilly. Still, it's a solid album and if you like the original Mott you'll probably like this album as well.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Although I have had yahoo mail for years, I recently have had some trouble with my e mail account and could not get any help from yahoo with my problem.
B009B0L324|5.0|There are few things in life more exciting than an AC/DC concert live. If you can't see them, you can get a sense of the excitement through this live recording. The set is list is very solid and as usual the performance is spot on. I can't wait for the next album and tour. Highly recommend.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Its a best music blu-ray we bought, and the quality of the disc & Adele's voice and many great songs
B00979CS50|4.0|I don't think that Young and Crazy Horse ever put out a bad album. This one departs from the softer side of Neil and he returns to rock. I love the opening song that goes about 27 minutes, reminds me of Cortez the Killer. If anything, the rest of the album goes too quickly. I was hoping for Walk Like A Giant but I guess I needed to get the expanded bonus edition. Still, this is Neil Young doing what he does best, rock n' roll.
0345803485|1.0|/sigh - words cannot describe the way I feel about this book but I will try... Crap.  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT bother reading this book.  See the description of the book below; it uses eloquent wording and brings in an extensive vocabulary however that is where it ends (and the description isn't even written by the author!).  The books is garbage.  Do not be brought in by the media's sensationalism of this book.  The author transports you into the mind of a 17 year old girl for the main character but she is 22 years old and she transports you into the mind of a 45 year old man but he is 27!!!!  Ugh... you want to read this genre than read Ann Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy, much more engrossing.  I have never written such a negative review on a book but I felt it was warranted to warn people to not be sucked into this crap.  Let me make it clear that when i say crap I am referring to this author's writing not the type of book it is.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|If only Arnold and James Earl Jones could take advantage of today's special effects.  This version is worth watching and even the bad reviews are kind.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|I am a sucker for any game that contains those cute penguins.  This calls for persistent to play.  I wouldn't mind if they had a speed control to sometimes slow the game down.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a compelling story and made me think for days<br />after reading it.  As a parent, I realize how far one might<br />go to defend your child and believe in their innocence.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a well thought out story line with no real predictability for the outcome. I will read something else by this author for sure.
1609611543|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars, because since reading it, I have started eating this way and I'm loving it!!! I had no idea WHEAT would give me such inflammation! Wow... Sooo thankful I found this book..... it's completely changed me... I'm just a regular girl who decided to try this.. and sooo thankful I did!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's okay for a free game I guess. The instructions are confusing and there is too much going on but it's still okay.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|I know I'm a few months late, but I finally jumped on the Quiet (by Susan Cain) train. I had to wait for it to become available through the library, but that's okay because it was mostly worth the wait. Not that I enjoy waiting, though, because I fall on the extrovert side of the spectrum. But, I also take a lot of things personally, so technically I think I'm a sensitive extrovert (I am also reward and threat sensitive). Whatever I am, I went into this thinking I'd learn a lot about how to understand my introverted husband, but instead I just read more of the same things I already knew.<br /><br />I did have a lot of `aha' moments during this book. It wasn't that the information was new, necessarily, but that it was put forth in such a way that it made sense. Such as open office plans being distracting and bad for memory or that it's better to study alone than in groups. These things make sense but I never gave them much thought.<br /><br />As a book nerd, I loved the section about `flow' (pursuing something for its own sake). For me, reading gives me flow. I do it for me, not because I gain outside rewards from it. I do it simply because I want to and I enjoy it. Granted, one could argue that liking something is a reward in itself, but that is a philosophical discussion that I am choosing not to go into right now (but it's along the lines of whether or not someone can be truly altruistic).<br /><br />My only problem with this book is that the author used the word `gregarious' on almost every other page. You know how when you say something over and over again it sounds weird and loses meaning? That's what happened with `gregarious' - I just started skipping sentences with that word in it because it held no meaning anymore.<br /><br />All in all, I wasn't dazzled by this book like many people seemed to be, but I enjoyed it. It was interesting, informative, and gave me some food for thought. I'm glad I read it, but I don't know that my life is much different.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'm glad I read the book before seeing the movie! Wanted the story to continue and go on forever. Absolutly loved it!!
1616550414|5.0|Fast delivery, great translation, outstanding artwork. If you are a Zelda fan, you will love the time line and how the stories connect.
B005PR2FD8|4.0|Overall I'd say the movie was alright. It had some parts that I didn't like such as how Devil Jin looked. But the main thing I was disappointed by in the movie was it featured Alisa but not Lars. The two go together like hot chocolate and marshmallows (cheezy comparison I know). This is not to say I disliked Xiaoyu but I would have rather seen Lars and Alisa kicking butt and making the story flow (like in Tekken 6).<br />If you're a Tekken fan you might like this film but it does venture away from the games a bit. In comparison to the live action Tekken film (which was disowned) this movie is amazing.<br /><br />Most liked - Panda's personality (comical and still protective of Xiaoyu), Alisa (she's one of my favorite characters in the games), Lee's mansion and voice (comic relief with all the action going on)<br /><br />Least Liked - lack of Lars (he's my favorite male character in the series), Devil Jin's appearance (to me it looked more like Ogre/True Ogre not like Devil Jin)

B0006PV5U8|4.0|This disc, compiled from recordings made in 1959 and 1963, has been justifiably famous for many years. The newly remastered version has improved a lot of the balance problems of previous issues where the solo violin was simply balanced too close to be realistic and where the orchestra was also balanced very close so that it could be heard. This inevitably resulted in a compromised depth of sound-stage.<br /><br />All three of these recordings have been remastered from the original 3 track tapes. As a result the balance between the solo violin and the orchestra has been greatly improved, as has the tonal qualities of the sound textures. The relatively flat sound-stage still remains but is improved.<br /><br />The best sound is that given to the Sibelius concerto which is given a blistering account by both Heifetz and the Chicago orchestra. This is a very exciting performance indeed and will, for many, be the main reason for buying the disc. The accelerations to the conclusions of both outer movements is undeniably thrilling and not matched in other performances. The harmonics are equally outstanding for their tonal purity in the last movement and throughout the orchestra's brass has something of a field day. This is not the only way to play this concerto of course, and there are other very satisfying performances by Chung, Mullover and Lin to consider who all benefit from better balanced recordings.<br /><br />The worst sound, curiously, is that given to the newest recording - the 1963 Glazunov concerto, where the flatness of the sound-stage is clearly apparent with the opening trumpet fanfares at the start of the final movement. This is so flat as to totally rob the instruments of any tone - very 2 dimensional. The actual playing of Heifetz survives the close microphoning well enough although it would be idle to pretend that it is as musically satisfying as the altogether excellent and well recorded account by Julia Fischer on Pentatone and in full SACD sound of proper realism. That disc also contains an equally satisfying and well balanced recording of the Prokofiev 2.<br /><br />Heifetz, once more very closely balanced with equally closely balanced orchestral support, was famous for his performances of Prokofiev's second concerto. His interpretation shows the composer's spiky character rather than his more whimsical interest in fantasy, more apparent in the first concerto. Quite apart from the balance issue, there is the issue as to how to balance the fantasy with the spiky elements of this concerto. Heifetz chooses spiky almost exclusively and this is emphasised by the recorded balance. Other performers such as Mintz, Lin and Fischer prefer to show a gentler side to the music with noticeably less aggression. In this they are all aided by more realistic recorded balances and tonal quality. Choice of interpretation will be a matter of preference. Recorded sound is a matter of fact.<br /><br />I would suggest that for Heifetz admirers the improved mastering will make this disc an absolutely essential purchase. The quality of the Sibelius performance alone will make this a front runner for many others despite my obvious reservations as regards the close balances of the remaining two concertos. It is why I re-bought the disc for example, and I am very happy that I did. However, I would also suggest that there are other versions of the Prokofiev and Glazunov concertos that may well be more musically and sonically more satisfying for many purchasers. This compromised disc is not superior to those by by Chung, Mullover, Fischer, Mintz or Lin to list but a few obvious alternatives so final choice will all be about purchasers' personal priorities.per realism. That disc also contains an equally satisfying and well balanced recording of the Prokofiev 2.<br /><br />Heifetz, once more very closely balanced with equally closely balanced orchestral support, was famous for his performances of Prokofiev's second concerto. His interpretation shows the composer's spiky character rather than his more whimsical interest in fantasy, more apparent in the first concerto. Quite apart from the balance issue, there is the issue as to how to balance the fantasy with the spiky elements of this concerto. Heifetz chooses spiky almost exclusively and this is emphasised by the recorded balance. Other performers such as Mintz, Lin and Fischer prefer to show a gentler side to the music with noticeably less aggression. In this they are all aided by more realistic recorded balances and tonal quality. Choice of interpretation will be a matter of preference. Recorded sound is a matter of fact.<br /><br />I would suggest that for Heifetz admirers the improved mastering will make this disc an absolutely essential purchase. The quality of the Sibelius performance alone will make this a front runner for many others despite my obvious reservations as regards the close balances of the remaining two concertos. It is why I re-bought the disc for example, and I am very happy that I did. However, I would also suggest that there are other versions of the Prokofiev and Glazunov concertos that may well be more musically and sonically more satisfying for many purchasers. This compromised disc is not superior to those by by Chung, Mullover, Fischer, Mintz or Lin to list but a few obvious alternatives so final choice will all be about purchasers' personal priorities.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a nice morality play and it asks a lot,of,important questions about society and our role in it. Characters were developed nicely once they stopped dying. In the genre of ditto pain fantasies I would give it a 7 but happily I do not see this as a movie, though I am sure,someone does.

B001EBWIRW|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It is kind of a silly humor movie, but I love it.  I bought the movie so I could share with my grandchildren.  This is a movie they can watch.  No bad language or sex scenes.
0765325950|5.0|With so many characters and storylines having built over 13 books this series finale did well in tying up loose ends.  Big book moved fast with great battles and best field tactics in the series.  A few too many Knute Rockne speeches but otherwise it was really good.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I've never thought of a need for flashlight holster until I tried this! This is a very well-built holster... tough clip (not filmsy and actually need strength to hook onto belt), tight rotation (meaning it will not swivel loosely), strong hold (1-inch diameter flashlight will not slip out), 8 different angles (practically 4 usable for me - front upwards 45%, front straight, front downwards 45%, down straight). Now I can get my mails, patrol around my house, work on stuffs - all in total darkness & hands-free!
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|I loved the costumes and talent. The Beatles music was unexpected and that portion of the movie was chaotic and hard to really see what was happening. I loved the rest.
B0064QNS62|4.0|If you loved things like Super Mario, Sonic, etc, you'll enjoy this.<br /><br />Only issue I have is the controls; they take a little bit of getting used to for someone new to tablets (at least they did for me).
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I was expecting a mixture between English and western riding. But instead it's all English. I feel like it makes fun of western because of the stereotypical outfits on the game.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book surprised me - I purchased it because of all the media hype and needing some reading material while recovering from surgery. While I am absolutely NOT into the BDSM lifestyle, I found this a fascinating read; just had to keep turning the pages to find out what came next. I am now reading book two of the series.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|I would and have suggested Sunken Condos as a must buy! Fantastic lyrics and of course great music to compliment Donald Fagen's great voice. Can't get it out of my head.
B00BF11STU|1.0|The last third of the movie was totally disjointed and damaged. Could not watch the end in full. Kept blacking out and reloading.<br />Not a great experience especially for a tense movie such as this one.
B0098460O4|5.0|I watched Jonathan and Charlotte on the YouTube over and over, and the experience never failed to make me cry. I finally decided to buy their CD, and it is simply wonderful. I am one of those who are glad these two proved Simon wrong, and they certainly provide us with a lesson about unconditional love.
B0001906O0|5.0|It's great to find CD's that contain all of those B-side songs and many of The Cures hard to find, rare songs. If you like The Cure, you will like &#34;Join The Dots&#34;.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie and alot of meaning and purpose behind the story. The whole family should watch this inspiring story and learn some true meanings of love. Every new father or soon to be father should really watch this movie.
B0000041TD|5.0|Makes me cry from joy to listen to the beauty of the voices. Listen to it as often as I can.
B002NPUCP8|4.0|This album is not &#34;metal&#34;, it's not going to remind you of Judas Priest or Guns-n-Roses, but it does show of some of Orianthi's abilities.  I see this as a &#34;pop&#34; cd that is supposed to get her the attention of a wide audience.<br />  I can't wait till Orianthi gets the opportunity to really show what she can do.  She has been a great addition to Alice Cooper and that should help promote her as well.  She is an amazing guitarist....I've never seen a chick play like that....and she is sooo hot looking....God, I wish I was younger.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun each month it changes where you run at it also gives a bonus bird an character that you can only get that month. If you enjoyed temple run you will enjoy this game. It is better. I have had no problems with the app. I recommend this app to everybody!

B000H6SXMY|3.0|I just found out that there are 2 different sets of this \\"Friends\\" Collection set going around online including here at Amazon due to the sellers. I've read here on this page that some people stated that the box set design is poor, this is an indication that they purchased a bootleg/fake version. Then there's other reviews stating that the box is sturdy (the authentic collection is very sturdy and very well designed) indicating these reviewers have the authentic set.    There are 2 big giveaways to tell if the set you're thinking of purchasing is authentic or a bootleg- which are the different photo of Chandler on the box and the disc holder design. Below is a link is a side by side comparison of the sets (both authentic and fake). I found this link while I was searching for reviews on youtube about this box set. I thought this was very informative, and as a die hard \\"Friends\\" fan, I wish to share this information.    [...]  <--- video. If you have problems clicking, then copy/paste in url.

B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie tells in a fictional fashion the back story of the raid that got Osama Bin Ladden.  While Seal Team Six got the press it was really the intelligence analysts that made the raid happen.  This movie tells the story of those analysts and their war and the toll it has taken on them.<br /><br />The movie will enthrall you without a moment of boredom.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|...is a blast and gaming is not a past time that I prefer.  I understand why my students get caught up staring at a screen for hours at a time now.

B00C7L4QB4|4.0|The Hannibal Lecter stories have played on the big screen as movies but now those who elect what the public will love have created a television series based on this human gourmand. In some ways it works and in some ways is doesn't.<br /><br />The series explores the early relationship between the renowned psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) and his patient Special Agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy), a young FBI criminal profiler who is haunted by his ability to empathize with serial killers. Another physician has been added in Dr. Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas) and the FBI lead is Agent Jack Crawford (Lawrence Fishburne). Without much introduction as to why Will Graham sees himself (in visions) murdering the victims we see in this first episode (and there are several grisly ones) we are supposed to understand that Will's special gift is that he is an `empath' - a person so sensitive to the minds of others that he can understand their motivations and thus be a valuable assist in solving crimes. But so far Will (even as played by the gifted Hugh Dancy) is just another seemingly disturbed bipolar-like personality.  Hopefully his character will be better developed as the season progresses. As for Mads Mikkelsen he makes a rather dull Hannibal Lecter as he munches on his gourmet servings of his victims: he will not erase the memory of Anthony Hopkins in the role, but the role may take on a whole new direction in this re-do. The series needs fleshing out (pardon the pun) if it is going to maintain anyone's interest for a full set of programs. It is wise to note that the author who created this concept - Thomas Harris - is writing the series with the help of Bryan Fuller.  Wait and see....Grady Harp, April 13
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game graphics are awesome. Can't wait for 3!!!!!<br />I know the next game will be the best! Keep up the good work.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|While I cannot attest to any historical accuracy, as a drama with some action in each episode, this series has grown upon me.  The acting is very good, particularly that of the actor playing the main character who portrays humor, wit and toughness very well.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Take all the great things from everyone else's reviews because it's all true except my hailfire is super accurate up to 75feet.Also mine charges within1-3 seconds so I can open fire really fast.I added the Stampede's grip,laser,and,sling+ammo bandolier.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|When I first heard that Depeche Mode's 13th studio album would be called \\"Delta Machine\\", I didn't know what to make of it.  It wasn't that I didn't like the title; rather I didn't grasp the meaning.  However, once I listened to it and heard the fusion of (delta) blues and electronics (machine) it all made sense.  When the band was recording this album Gore and Gahan both noted that it had a synergy of \\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of Faith & Devotion\\".  Both of these albums are classics in many DM fans' hearts, as well as many music critics.  Therefore one could argue that \\"Delta Machine\\" has some pretty big shoes to fill.  Does Delta Machine really sound like\\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of Faith & Devotion\\"?  I will revisit this notion shortly....<br /><br />Before my review I have a disclaimer, I have been a Depeche Mode fan for 20 years.  I will be seeing them for the sixth time this fall.  I own all their albums, singles, many bootlegs, DVDs, quite a few shirts and framed posters in my house.  Depeche Mode (along with U2) has been the soundtrack to my life, as corny as that may sound.  So my review might be seen as biased or just following the band on blind faith.<br /><br />There are a group of Depeche Mode fans who still long for the return of Alan Wilder who left the band in 1995.  I for one was sick to my core when he left the group.  Nevertheless, I feel that the albums released since Wilder's departure have been really great collections of work.  I am well aware of the contributions that Wilder gave the group.  Notwithstanding, anyone who is familiar with Depeche Mode's history should be happy the band is still making music.  And if they aren't pleased with the music, I am not sure why after 20 years these individuals keep buying \\"Alan free DM albums\\".<br /><br />I wonder if Wilder stayed with the group if this type of music progression might not have happened anyway.  Wilder's latest Recoil album had a great deal of blues fussed in the music.  In contrast, in the wake of Wilder's departure the band has actually recorded more tracks pure album and Dave Gahan has become more involved in the production of songs.  The Alan Wilder debate is just about as heated as the debate of George Lucas and the original Star Wars trilogy.  I embrace the notion my words are not going to change many minds, but I feel it would give more credit to my review to note my position.<br /><br />As for Delta Machine sounding like \\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of Faith & Devotion\\", I really don't know if I agree with that statement.  Every Depeche album, even the ones with Wilder, is its own musical journey.  I see very little overlap sonically in their albums, other than I can tell it is a Depeche Mode album.  Nevertheless, if I really had to dig deep I would say the blues influence and some of the lyrics might mirror SOFAD.  As for some of the electronics, synths and pace I can see a little bit of \\"Violator\\" and even a bit of \\"Ultra\\".  However, if anyone is hoping for Violator II and/or SOFAD \\"The Sequel\\" I believe they will be let down.<br /><br />\\"Delta Machine\\" as a whole is a dark, sexy, haunting and spiritual journey....in other words it is a Depeche Mode album. I think \\"Heaven\\" is an amazing track and it didn't bother me at all as a first single.  \\"Soothe My Soul\\" is a classic DM tune and I look forward to seeing it live later this year.  Actually there really isn't any song on this record I dislike; some tracks pop out more than others, but none of the music on this record is poor.  I also highly recommend getting the deluxe edition of this album, the bonus tracks are amazing.  It is pretty shocking they weren't on the proper release.  Then again \\"Ghost\\" was just a bonus track from \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" and I feel it was one of the strongest songs they recorded for that album.<br /><br />I must also say that Dave Gahan's writing abilities have continued to bloom.  I would say his two solo albums and working with Soulsavers last year has really paid off.\\"Should Be Higher\\" I feel is one of the highlights on this album, which again was penned by Gahan as was another favorite \\"Happens All the Time\\".  I will take this moment to say that Gahan's voice is absolutely fantastic.  He really has done different things with his vocals on this record and I love it.  He truly is an underrated front man.<br /><br />As for the packaging of the deluxe album, I am not thrilled about how the CDs are stored.  They are packaged in a way where they are prone for scratches.  The lyrics and photographs of the band are always welcomed.  I really love this album and I think it will mature nicely in their catalogue.  Again, I don't view it as sequel to \\"Violator\\" or \\"Songs of Faith & Devotion\\".  I also didn't sit and pick apart the production and long for Alan Wilder while I listened to it.  I take it for what it is, a Depeche Mode album from a group of men who have evolved, grown, matured and are in a different place than they were 20 years ago.  I would certainly take any song off this record over that Top 40 non-sense.  I really hope these guys keep making music.  They are legends and if you have a chance to see them live go for it, while you still can.\\"Should Be Higher\\" I feel is one of the highlights on this album, which again was penned by Gahan as was another favorite \\"Happens All the Time\\".

He said that the bass and in game sound is great the only thing he dislike is the long cord and the noise they make when you put them on, but other than that they are great you can not hear anything when you have them one which he loves.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book and loved the series. There's a little dry time in the first and third books; People's back stories, etc. But all in all it's a good book and wraps the whole series up

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|As a HUGE fan of Tolkien I had wondered how Jackson was going to stretch the book into 3 films.  I enjoyed the story he is creating but I must admit there are some pretty large changes from the novel to the screen.  All in all, very entertaining!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author engages the reader right away. Sometimes it is the description of day-to-day life of training that is most compelling. The training and routines are as interesting as the Big event. Amazing account. (better than the movie).
B008476HBM|4.0|I first read this before I was old/mature enough to understand Austen's talents in both storytelling and satire.  Glad I read it again as an adult.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am taking my sweet time with this book.  It is a very hefty read, but it is so interesting I do not want to rush to finish it.  Very enjoyable.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in US history, particularly during the 1850's and 1860's.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I finally got around to reading this powerful novel after the rebirth of interest in Hugo by the film.  Shouldn't have waited so long!

B00656C6KK|5.0|This album is mostly unreleased Terry Melcher material from the mid80's.  While not all of it is great, Doris could sell any song with her excellent chops.  Disney Girls (originally recorded by the Beach Boys for Surf's Up) is especially good.  Some non-80's material is also thrown in to fill out the album.  Her late son Terry Melcher's recording of &#34;Happy Endings&#34; is also heart-felt.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun, if a little addictive. Always liked the real version of this game, so virtual game scores big!
B009FZFONO|3.0|I enjoy the charaters and locations. The acting is amazing.<br />The hardest part about this season for me was the level of expectation I had coming out of the comic book. I realize this show is meant to be a totally different experience, but still the Governor has such a reputation from the books it's hard to shift my expectation. The only other complaint I have about this season is that they killed off too many of Rick's group early on in season 3, so there were very few people to empathize with and not enough of the personal dramas that were so much of seasons 1 & 2. Otherwise this continues to be a cutting edge (pun intended) series from AMC. I hope they come out with a soundtrack CD soon for Bear McCreary's stellar score.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I love this band. Their use of brass instruments is very unique and the lead singers voices are so beautiful and haunting together. very inspiring.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Witty, interesting and incredible acting. A must see for all fans of Sherlock Holmes or to any mystery fan. I also give my regards to the writers, they made a great job out of modernizing the novels for the TV show.
B008CRC506|5.0|I would like to chime in & say \\"Smash\\" is really great. The story, along with the music, is fantastic. I wait all week for this show. The only thing missing is The Blue Ray Edition. Season 2 is even better. The writers are still in the right direction. Meaning, they have us viewers, waiting for the next episode. Everyone involved, Thanks for such a great show.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it. Very enjoyable. Wish I could earn more bingo chips though. Can't seem to win. But it is a lot of fun
B008602KQI|3.0|Great movie!  I would have enjoyed it more and would have given it 5 stars if Amazon wasn't freezing up.  The movie froze at least 30 times.  Not good Amazon, not good at all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the funniest game ever created.it has a super fun feature where you can ride a mine cart.if I were you I would stop reading this review and just get the game.

B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I can't see that having this information out there adds anything to my way of life, even if I was working. If I want to get in touch with one of my friends or work related folks, I will email or call them. I have no need for knowing what everyone else is doing. And - this is big - I get enough junk phone calls and emails without having this out there. I like my privicy.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The same as most hidden object games, but good graphics. Story line is good, finding the objects is a little harder than most games I've played.

1476735115|5.0|I first heard about this book in a lengthy Wall Street Journal article.  The reviews were so good (made me a bit suspicious)  that I expected the book to be less interesting and readable than it is.  I had not read any Sci Fi in many years.  However, once I started this one, it was hard to put down.  The book paints a vivid picture of this strange new world.  You feel like you are right there in the middle of everything that is happening.  The level of detail adds to this experience - you can see, hear, and almost taste what is described by the characters.  You may even find yourself gasping for air as you follow the story when Jules in under water.  Mr. Howey does a great job of developing his characters and the scenario while leaving enough out to keep you guessing at where the story is going.  You will not be disappointed with this masterpiece.  In fact, like me, you will probably be debating whether to download the next saga of the Wool story or to wait for the hardback version to be printed.  I just hope they publish it soon.  As for the movies, I think Ridley Scott may be able to do this story justice on the big screen.  We will have to wait and see.  I wonder who he will cast as Jules and as Lukas.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Great way for me and my kiddo to pass time when waiting. Or even to pass time while at home and bored!<br /><br />Edited to add: it's still a great game but I'm rather upset at the moment. Make sure your children never accidentally remove the game! It starts you over completely and takes everything from you. Including coins that had been purchased in the shop. It took all of five seconds for this to happen.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I'm an old man, but thoroughly enjoyed reading C. S. Lewis' classic children's story again.  It was especially nice with the Kindle format because of the easy reading large font capability.  The story is a fast read and keeps your interest.  I bought this book and two others on a one day sale.  The sale price was just right.  The normal price I consider to be higher than necessary.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Steller performance by Matthew McConaughey.  The Lincoln office was genius and I also liked the play on words of the title.
0887307280|5.0|Excellent Layout of ideas. Book increases awareness of different aspects of business a Entrepreneur should consider to  increase chances of success.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love the Jack Teacher series. I've read just about all of them and have enjoyed everyone.  Real good book.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I cannot recomend this book more than the tv series, they both are compliments of one another and excellent works of art.<br />This book grabs your attention from the start and doesn't let go, a travel into the human psyche from an assassin point of view.<br />Highly recommend it.
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|Having something new from Bowie is truly a blessing.  The more I listen to this one, then more I like it.  Some really good stuff here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time.It is really fun. I love Sydney. It is a lot better than Rio.Absolutely recommend this game! :)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm not sure I've ever read a book so quickly. I couldn't put it down and fell in love with each character and their raw emotions.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|This does what is should, as it should, but unfortunately for $30.  I also with the cord shot off at an angle or was flexible.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Seldom do you watch a movie of this power and ability to make you think.  A beautiful rendition of a great book!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very fun addictive game. The only down fall is after a few levels you must purchase the full game to play on to anymore levels.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This is a lawyer/trial style movie but in the political arena, with all players aggressively seeking an Emmy. Very politically detailed, but most supporting characters, like Lincoln's family, are more like caricatures of whatever historical documentation they could find. This is not a documentary of a life, but a very fixed and detailed period of time around the passing of the 13th amendment, and somewhat a \\"high five\\" of how great white Americans are for passing the anti-slavery amendment (but that is to be expected in a movie about Lincoln).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game, just the right amount of challenges,& its a cool looking game. The game updates with fresh back ground scenary. I just wish the music change with the background scenes.
B00AJF87QU|4.0|\\"Grafitti On The Train\\" is the eighth studio album by Stereophonics a Welsh band that has had tremendous success in the UK, Europe and other countries.  They have done some small tours in the U.S. and opened for David Bowie on part of his \\"Reality\\" tour.  The have had 10 UK top ten singles and several of their albums have also been on the top of the charts.  For some reason they just haven't had the same success in the U.S.  I agree with the other reviewer about this new album.  The may be trying to shed their Britpop image their music has often been labeled.  They are a great live band and they do sell out their headline concerts and festival dates when they are on tour.<br />This new album is a departure from their more familiar sound but Kelly Jones the lead singer and songwriter has that special talent of storytelling through his song lyrics.  Some of the new songs are a bit more somber but still get your attention and keep wanting to hear them over and over.  His unique vocals are very expressive and emotional which make their music very genuine.  I really think if anyone is looking for something fresh and different they should look into this new Stereophonics album.  If you like this one then go back to some of their other albums and you just might find out what their fans have known for years.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Game is fun but it wants you to buy items to continue playing.  I don't like games like  that I just wsnt to play.
B00C1E8E7E|1.0|His music sucks I don't even know if you can call it music. Hopefully the pos overdoses in the near future.
B001B51B9M|5.0|Robert Preston shines as always, Ron Howard was as cute as a bugs ear, the rest arejust plain fun to watch.
B004CAWKXE|5.0|Danger Days is the album I waited for four years for. It's no Black Parade they even said themselves they would never top The Black Parade but they came so close. The stand out song on this album is Summertime. Now that the band is over The Kids from Yesterday has so much more emotional meaning than it did on November 22nd 2010. Long live My Chemical Romance.
0061537934|5.0|This book is the most wonderful book about a dog you will ever read. You can't put it down. If you love dogs or even just like them, you are sure to enjoy this book. Garth gives a dog named Enzo the same range of emotion and capacity for love we only think of humans to have. No wonder dogs truly are mans best friend.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love the movieand I love the soundtrack!!  Even my kids who are into rock and rap are saying they like it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What I say, but AMAZING ! LOVE these movies! Can't wait for the rest of them! Pure entertainment and worth every cent!
B008HB34I4|5.0|This shows a typical person being used to carry a message much as was done in the Bible. it is powerful and even gives some hope. i thought it was done well.
B0093BUVPG|5.0|A beautiful album from start to finish soulful yet smooth. Blends Soul and Jazz seamlessly. Highly recommended, a must have for any music lover.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The storyline, involving several sets of people, was , as I said, addictive.  I watched the whole set  non-stop.  It was very satisfying to continue the action, rather than having to wait a week to get the next installment!  The cast was uniformly superb.  My only reservation was the shocking ending.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and quite enjoyable - nice to have on my Kindle.  I would recommend trying it on yours.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|As a long-time Harry Potter fanatic (I have the audio collection, as well as the hardback version), I know the series well enough to find the omissions, as well as the general design to be unsatisfying.  The acting is wonderful, I must admit.
1400069742|5.0|Lynne Olsen has provided us another excellent work of that very interesting period just before America's entry into World War II.<br /><br />While the book's subtitle centers around Roosevelt and Lindbergh, the compelling story is both comprehensive and, I felt, fair to those involved in this story.<br /><br />We often think that the most important part the United States played was the Lend Lease program to aid primarily England, and then, Pearl Harbor puts us in the war, and that is the story. This book tells us so much more.  America was deeply divided about the war in Europe.  Just as Hitler proclaimed that Germany had been stabbed in the back at the end of the Great War, many Americans felt that England and special interests had lured the United States into the last war.  Their beliefs were tainted with anti-Semitic thoughts, images of profiteering at the expense of the blood tax paid by American soldiers, and to top it all off, Britain was not paying back the enormous debt owed to America (a debt so vast that it prompted Wilson to institute the income tax.<br /><br />FDR is an enigma to some extent. He realizes the power of the German war machine, and even though America has an ocean as a barrier, the world would be vastly changed to the detriment of America if Hitler ruled Europe.  The only thing standing in the way prior to Hitler's attack on Russia in June, 1941, was England, whose sole accomplishment was a successful evacuation from Dunkirk, and her greatest weapon, a pudgy, brilliant, and perfectly stubborn leader who refused to negotiate with the Germans.<br /><br />Lindbergh, I think is fairly represented in this book.  Having know little about this man, other than the obvious flight across the Atlantic, he is a fascinating, frustrating, and stubborn man without one bit of sense when it came to diplomacy.  He was accused by many of being very pro Nazi, and his enormous popularity was mixed with his skill of putting both feet in his mouth when speaking.  There were people in America that loved him and others that hated him. His loss of his first child and his intense privacy resulted in a self imposed exile in Europe before the war.  He did not help himself when he accepted a medal from the Nazi government, personally authorized by Hitler.  His nemesis was not only Roosevelt, but especially Harold Ickes, FDR's attack dog, who relentlessly waged a smear campaign against Lindbergh in the court of public opinion. Sadly, his beautiful and talented wife Anne Morrow plays the tragic role in this relationship because she had to endure his anti-Semitism, his leaning towards Hitler, while all the time learning of German atrocities against their own citizens, and later their hanging menace over England, where she and Lindbergh had lived for some time.<br /><br />There is a large cast of characters and organizations that were fighting for their idea of where America needed to be as the stage unfolded in Europe.  Even the name isolationist was itself an argument over a word.  Many who wanted to stay out of the war saw themselves as non-interventionists.<br /><br />Without attempting to cover every person and organization involved in this wonderful story, I would like to thank the author for introducing me to Lord Lothian, the British ambassador.  He is a fascinating personality; very much the eccentric type you would expect of a British peer, and was a wonderfully effective ambassador for England.  He died in December of 1940 from kidney problems. Oddly enough, because he had converted from Catholicism to Christian Sciene, he refused the blood transfusions that would likely have saved him.  The author also introduced us to our ambassador to England during the war in her previous book, [[ASIN:1400067588 Citizens of London: The Americans Who Stood with Britain in Its Darkest, Finest Hour]],  John Gilbert Winant, whom the British loved, especially after having to endure Joseph Kennedy, a bombastic gasbag who kept telling the British they were beaten, and never spent a night in London during the blitz.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this book and encourage all readers to get a copy. It is like Christmas morning to a kid.sh they were beaten, and never spent a night in London during the blitz.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this book and encourage all readers to get a copy.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The fact that this is based on true events makes the film all the more gripping.  Once again, the cast is superb, and Colin Firth's Oscar was well deserved.  I've been a Firth fan since I first made his acquaintance as Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, many moons ago, but he oudid himself in this film.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|What a waste of money! They didn't put in the same effort they did with Lord of the rings and thus really missed the mark.
B002VBV1S6|4.0|Easy to read, pure fun. Ocean's 11 with a fantasy twist and a bit of welcome cruelty. Once I started I had to get to the end. All in all, it may not be Tolkien or Martin but i sure is a lot of fun. I'll read the next one too.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is extremely addicting and fun to play, while still being hard and time consuming. I recommend this game for people of all ages.
B00005JKBC|5.0|just what i was looking for - dvd works fine i have watched it a few times and everything seems to work.
B00338QENI|5.0|I read this for book club - I could not put it down.  This book is an easy read with wonderful information about Henrietta, her life, her family, and her immortal gift to all of us. This would be a wonderful summer read or class read for students as well as a great read for anyone interested in the scientific contibution of Mrs. Lacks.
B008N9AASC|5.0|Visually stunning. Epic, transformative, striking, thought provoking.  I'd only recommend seeing it if you have a large HDTV&#62;  SEE IT NOW.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Realistic. Current.  Possible. This one that you won't put down.  Attemps to put today's events in perspective. You will enjoy this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|At first I was like this game is probably alright but then when you start you just can't stop! This game is absolutely addictive!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed as much as the previous books in this series.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing the whole time you are reading it.
B000IDEQTK|4.0|Movie held interest.  Story was good.  Acting was good.  Nicely done.  I don't know why we have to fill in required word count just to give it a few stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is where the real motivations are revealed and the real will to overcome is unearthed. Intense and captivating. Must read more!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is so much fun. We can't stop playing! Even my five year old enjoys it. Very addictive and Easy to play. Just playing it in the free mode, it is enjoyable.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Just like the real game.  You are able to direct the coins going into the game.  Dropping coins to get fake prizes just does not interest me much.
B0000041A9|5.0|This has been around for many decades and superseded by wunderkind in each new generation. Well, the musicianship, musicality and intellectual sinew you will discover here is in a class of its own. At the time this was recorded there was a very special connection between this husband and wife duo and it shines through. I am, like some others, sometimes unsure if Brahms is great or just bombastically overblown. Here I am convinced he was great. It's their job to persuade you to that opinion and they do. If you love this music you probably own it. If you want to dip your toe in the water then start here. Be aware that Brahms can take several listening to fully bloom in your consciousness.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|you get to go to different areas with a different pony<br />that makes it fun to play .My daughter likes this game
B00138KFYO|5.0|LOL DUH! Of course it's awesome! I learned to sing to her. I bought HAIR, Janis, Jimmy, The Doors....and if you listen to their music, yes you ARE on a first name basis! LOL Of course you can't forget Bob!

B00005RHGL|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! It really IS epic! It's an important part in american history and I think they capture the strength and gumption in these people. Lots of extras, I haven't tried the DVD rom yet tho. I'm sure that's cool too!
