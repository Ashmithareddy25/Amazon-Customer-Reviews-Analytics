B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I think the reviews have been overly harsh.  The item I received was exactly like the product in the advertised pictures.  It is solid plastic with a rubberized feel.  The front cover fits fairly flush onto the unit base and makes it look well designed for the device.    The biggest problem that I found with a large unprotected area at the bottom of the case towards where the power button is.  Only the corners are actually protected.  The plastic in that area is a little sharp depending on how you hold it.  I have read other criticism about front flap not securing magnetically...which should have been in the design for a product of this price point.    It seems reasonable that this should cost between $20 and $30.  The original $40 was a bit much.  So far I am satisfied with the quality of the case.

159514188X|1.0|I admit my expectations for this book were exceptionally high, I heard about it in magazines, online, and through word of mouth. I expected to fall into the story head first and be sent reeling with emotions. Instead I made it 3/4 of the way through before I decided doing a load of laundry was more rewarding than finishing the book. I didn't think Hannah's reasons for killing herself were extreme enough to be 'justified' even in a teenage-agnst mind frame. Obviously everyone internalizes things differently, but if the average teen had Hannah's psychological tolerance level then there would be a teen suicide epidemic across the nation. This book may be eye opening for some, which is good if it helps someone cope or become aware to a peer's issues. But if I were to have read this in high school (which was only 5 years ago) I would have just thought Hannah was overly sensitive and needed to 'woman-up'. The author had a solid premise but weak execution. Obviously teens are prone to being more highly sensitive due to their limited real-life exposure and plethora of raging hormones, but keeping that in mind I just didn't find Hannah's story was realistic or relatable enough to draw me in.

They have been carrying burdens for decades, that could have been unloaded, with some knowledge of the skills mentioned in this book.

0451232577|2.0|When a long book is also good, it is a delight. In contrast, a long book that slowly turns from indifferent to bad is a chore. Sadly, FALL OF GIANTS is one of those books.<br /><br />Ken Follett, instead of coming up with three new ideas decided to stretch the plot of a single book into three, thousand-page, parts of a Trilogy. And it is painfully apparent. The story could had easily fit into a third of the pages and it would had been tighter and much easier to follow. A thousand pages novel which received little work and even less craft is too much.<br /><br />And yet, for all its length, the book never gives but a very epidermal and caricaturish study of its characters. You get to follow the honorable yet rigid aristocrat and his temperamental Russian-princess of a wife; the rich suffragette and the poor, single-mother activist; the level headed German gentleman and his homosexual Austrian cousin; the young American presidential adviser and the spoiled daughter of the nouveau-riche thug; and two Russian brothers that could not be more opposite in character. However, apart from a name and a brief character-tag you get nothing. They all feel like stick figures drawn at the corner of the pages containing the story.<br />You keep turning pages because you are curious, but, after a while, you realize that you do not actually care for any of them.<br /><br />Around these characters the world collapses into World-War I and everyone's life is swept into the cataclysmic currents that engulf the world. Strangely, the political decisions and machinations described are oversimplified and described as much more naive and open than realistically possible. And everything has a strong left-wing bias.<br /><br />On top of being a bloated book, for some strange reason, Follett makes numerous clumsy attempts to exonerate the House of Rothschilds from any wrongdoing. Their British branch is described as \\"peace loving\\" whereas the role of their German branch is conveniently omitted.<br />In fact, it was the Rothschilds who funded Lenin, Trotsky and their Bolshevik party in taking control of the Russian revolution. This well calculated move (which opened up what was later to be known as the Red Orchestra) turned an allied nation into the Communistic bogeyman that fueled the Cold War armament race of the past 50 years - and seeded the global debt crisis of our generation.<br />For over 1,200 years, in war or piece, republics or totalitarian regimes, this Khazarian House of international financing has been puppet-mastering history from the shadows - and the House always seem to win.<br /><br />If this were a mere book of fiction it would be just an annoyance. However, Follett claims numerous historians as his advisers and, thus, opens himself to valid criticism. For all his historic claims, the story he tells is more of an Orwellian re-write than actual history.<br /><br />Pass.

B005HSG3TC|2.0|First of all, you must realize that the case feels light and crappy when you receive it simply because it is designed to be a lightweight, slim case. And that it is; the case disappears and contributes little weight to the device. The quality of the soft back is nice once on the Fire, in my opinion. It may feel like a cheap case when you unpack it, but once on the Fire it feels a little more substantial.  Where the case really fails is in functionality. Like the iPad Smart Cover, the case has a paneled screen protector. Because the Fire is much smaller, it only has two panels, which means you cannot use the Fire in \\"wedge\\" mode (like the Smart Cover) because that would require three panels, i.e. a triangle. But you can use the panels to place the device in stand mode (see product photos), ideal for watching movies and the like. Because the cover can--once again--not create a triangle, one of the wedges rests against a groove on the back of the case in order to create a pseudo-triangle. The groove is very small and because of its rubbery texture, the panel can easily slide out of the groove and cause the Fire to fall. However, while it is flimsy to get the case into stand mode, if nobody hits the case it will likely remain in place.  In place of magnets (as in the Smart Cover), the case uses a wide elastic strap to hold the front flap in place. It is certainly annoying and time-consuming to unhook the strap and then pin the cover flap behind the Fire using the same strap, but it is doable. I wish the strap was a little more loose, or that there was a lock mechanism that didn't involve constant pulling and bending.   I purchased the case at $39.99, its original price. To call this case worth $39.99, even by the standards of the accessory industry, is ridiculous. At its adjusted price of $29.99, it is slightly more reasonable. But functionally, it still underperforms and I'd be quite ashamed to pair a great product with such a poor case.
0385535139|1.0|I have been reading John Grisham since \\" A Time To Kill\\" and have enjoyed most all of his books. It seems as though his last 4-5 books are just made to  pay his bills.

B002QH2NUA|3.0|I recently purchased this CD after having heard its killer live version of \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" on beatlesarama.com. I rushed to figure out what album it had come from and quickly purchased the album. Indeed, just about all the song choices and performances are excellent. However, after a day or so of a couple of listenings, I started to hear the tell-tale zippering crackle and robotic buzz of auto-tune on Paul's voice. And once you're listening for auto-tune, it's very obvious.  I'm sorry to say  that this realization mostly ruins the experience of this album for me. \\"Mrs. Vandebilt\\" is mostly unlistenable.  I think I would greatly prefer to hear the mistakes. I would really like to hear this album de-tuned, or else a much more judicious application of pitch correction.  I would instead recommend McCartney's \\"Back in the US\\" which is a similar set, but without (as far as I can tell) the auto-tune.

1451627289|1.0|This is an actual book review, but I'd like to jump on the bandwagon and say I disagree with the price.  And also, considering people buy KINDLE books from AMAZON, leaving reviews disagreeing with the price seems the logical thing to do.  It's Amazon Marketplace, not Book Reviews R Us.  I gave it one star because I absolutely wouldn't recommend this book.  It's a waste of time and money.  If King could be edited, this might have been one of his better novels.  The love story between Sadie and Jake became more poignant at the end of the novel, with the bitter decisions that had to be made.  I'd say it's one of his better endings, rather than springing on the reader with a ridiculous outcome for a tangled story, he gave a soft ending that was pretty touching.  But getting there was tough.  Jake's second voyage into the past was long and very obviously unedited.  Given the right editor, it probably could have been cut by about 100 to 200 pages, and they probably even could have shorn off a few other corners.  I also lost my ability to view Jake as a realistic character.  He's fast-talking, awesome, and pretty perfect with just about everything he does.  And any stumble he did have, didn't deter him in the least, even if it didn't seem plausible.  I'm not a huge fan of King's relentless ability to shove supernatural elements into a story that would have done fine without them, but the timecard man actually became pretty interesting by the end of the book.  And as I said, had the book not taken 800 some pages to get to an interesting character or facet of the story, I'd probably give it more than one star.  The book might not be a disaster, but I'd never agree that I couldn't have read something better in that time.  This book isn't about the Kennedy assassination, or really the past (I will say that the over abundance of statements about just how cheap the fifties/early sixties were, just about sent me over the edge), it was a story of a man trying to make the world better, failing, and picking right back up again to set it right.  Sacrificing what he must to get that done.  It's been done before, and I'd have to say that it's definitely been done better.

B005POK858|5.0|This game really reminds me of the awesome jrpgs of the past such as Final Fantasy 5 and 6 and Chrono Trigger.

Finally the game has been very responsive for me so far with not a single freeze up on my Evo 4g.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I am puzzled with all the bad reviews for this case. I was expecting something terrible to show up when I saw the reviews start popping up yesterday. The case is basically a plastic shell on the outside for the back, and a thin synthetic type material for the front, very similar (but thinner) to Apple's smartcover for iPad 2. The device fits inside the plastic shell perfectly. There is no room for it to move around at all.<br /><br />The plastic part has a elastic band on the bank which can be used to insert your hand and hold the device when reading on it, or it can be brought to the front to securely close the front flap on the case. Overall it is a slim profile case that adds only marginal bulk to the device. The front flap has in inner velvet lining which comes in contact with the screen and keeps is safe.<br /><br />Parts that could have been better - the front flap is slim, but a little too thin. I'm sure it will protect the device adequately, but it feels lacking in terms of protection. Not a big deal for me personally because I use the device only at home and am fairly good with keeping my devices safe. The second, the most important drawback of this case is that the stand just plain and simple - sucks! It is very flimsy, again because of the thin material on the flap. There is no way the device can be held on the stand when reading on the Kindle in my lap, for example. The only way the stand stays firm is if it's kept on a flat surface like a table or something. I think if they wanted to keep the material thin, that would be fine, except they should have added some weight in the middle part of the front panel that folds around - this part takes the weight of the stand, and if it was made slightly thicker, it would have worked very well.<br /><br />Other than these two drawbacks, I like this case and I would recommend it if you're looking for a light-use case. For those who paid $39.99 in pre-orders, Amazon automatically put in a $10 gift card in my account for the price difference, I didn't even have to contact them. I am assuming everyone received the credit. If you didn't, you can probably contact them for assistance.dn't even have to contact them. I am assuming everyone received the credit.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I was very skeptical at first due to the price , below 100 bucks , but I took my chances , I was very inclined to get the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 for $300 which sound great and are very comfortable .<br />What a surprize when they came , beatifully packaged , I thought I had a jewel in my hands , instantly reminded me of Steve Jobs and how much thinking he puts in packaging .<br />At first when I first tried they sounded kind of flat , but by reading the reviews I broken them in , just a few hours , maybe 6 hours , but I know I have to do it for approx. 40 hrs . Then I tried them again .........WOW what a sound out of my I Pad , then I tried them at my digital Sony amp ..........just brilliant .<br />How come for just below $90 they can offer something like this ?<br />I am much into sound and try everything I can at local stores and with friends , these cans are amazing , I am sure there are some better out there but for this price do not think twice , what an amazing piece of art , just fantastic !<br />I am listening to them as I am writing this review and I feel like flying in the sky ....just incredible .<br />You can't go wrong with these , I am going to say they sound as good as the expensive Boses. Needless to mention , extremelly comfortable .<br />Great product Sony.
B001HN6922|1.0|As a parent who has watched the first Cars movie numerous times with an enthralled toddler, I'm confused by how this sequel came from that jem.  The first movie had a story line and moral value, where this monstrosity had neither, and where the story lacked substance, it made up for with action.  For a children's movie, the word \\"die\\" was mentioned numerous times, and cars were being purposely injured or killed.  Though \\"moron\\" was mentioned in the first movie, I heard more insults thrown in this one (i.e. \\"idiot,\\" \\"dim-wit\\").  The story was rushed with no character building, and the nemesis was obvious.  Though I'm sure my child wasn't interested in the fossil fuels vs. engineered alternatives debate, I feel this non-fictional subject was too mature for younger audiences.  Overall, I'm sure my child would love to sit and watch this movie again, maybe just as much as the first, but I refuse to keep it in my house another day.  I'm glad I rented it first vs. shelling out cash for this wreck of a sequel.  I recommend you rent it, too, before making this investment and decide for yourself whether it's worth adding to your collection; as I am, you may be glad you did.  As a conservative parent, lover of the first film, and sucker for investing money into the Cars franchise, I feel duped for even being excited for this movie to arrive in my mailbox, let alone watching it with my child.  Disney and Pixar, I truly feel embarrassed for you.

I kept turning the pages hoping it would get better and it never did.  I wonder if Steel actually wrote this book herself or if she asked some seventh grader to write it for her?  This poor excuse for a novel belongs in the dumpster of Hotel Vendome.  Don't waste your money like I did!

This book contains color & value theory, lighting nuances, paint properties, and much more. I have already recommended it to some beginning artists, as a great basic resource.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I love this cover!  Granted, I got it for my Kindle 4 and not a Kindle Fire.  The one that I ordered is no longer listed and from reading the other reviews, I think maybe they've listed this for the Fire, which is close to the same size, but slightly larger.  I do love this cover though.  It's made very well and fits my Kindle 4 perfectly - the touch is the same size, so I imagine it will fit it nicely as well.  It's a deep \\"brick\\" red color and very well made.  I had seen a previous review where someone posted photos of some discoloration on the back of their Kindle after keeping it in the case for some time.  I can only imagine it was from the dye used in the fabric in the case. To keep that from happening to mine, I cut a piece of black felt (found at any craft store) to the size of my Kindle and have placed it between the Kindle and the case.  Overall, I think this is a very nice case.<br /><br />**Update - 9 months later, I still love this cover.  It's very well made and is holding up very well - with lots of use and travel with it in my purse, it still looks new.

B005CK76ZA|3.0|Me gusto bastante la calidad del empaque, sin embargo me da la impresion de que Amazon me envio un producto usado pues en el LP1 (El album Nevermind) me vino con fallas el lado A. Los discos -físicamente- son de buena calidad.  Ahora, hablando sobre el contenido musical, pues escuchar Nevermind en LP es otra experiencia , yo nunca lo habia hecho y fue algo que me encanto. Ahora la queja es, que por cuestiones de capacidad en esta version LP viene apenas la mitad del material de la DEdition de CD.   LP2: b-sides que ya fueron publicados en WTLO, lo rescatable son los tracks de las Smart Studio Sessions.  LP3: Smart studio session (continuacion) y tracks de The Boombox Rehearsals - los cuales me dejaron muy decepcionado-.  LP4:continuan tracks de The Boombox Rehearsals -malos la verdad- . Lo bueno de este disco son el par de tracks de ;a BBC session y Endless Nameless.   Como ven no hay nada de 'Live @ the Paramount' o de los Devonshire mixes, que a mi opinión hubiera sido sensacional escucharlos en LP.  Compren este LP solo si son muy fans de Nirvana o si gustan de coleccionar LPs.

After liking most of Thank Me Later I thought Drake had something going, but he's becoming like 50 cent whose first album was his only hit.  Sad to say this, but if you like Lil Wayne and mediocre beats go ahead and pick this up otherwise just keep waiting to \\"Thank\\" him and pass this one up.

B004J4RQIM|5.0|I really loved the first Hit Man concert.  The lineup of incredible stars to me was a once in a lifetime event.  Then comes Hit Man Returns.  This cd/blu ray is always available on the PBS web site.  At Amazon,if you search for this, the disc comes up for 100.00.  I finally was able to find it here for 20.00 and it takes 9-12 days for them to ship it.  Anyway, it finally arrived and we sat down to watch it on our 63 Samsung inch plasma TV.  The lineup of singing stars on this disc didn't appear to be that impressive.  The first 3 tracks were ok, but not great.  Then the concert got rolling.  It turns out the performers I am familar with were brilliant, and the ones I wasn't familiar were the same. When the concert was over, all my wife and I could say was WOW!  I think both concerts were simply great.  Music for everyone.  Everything from operatic, to soul and funk, and everything in between.  I don't know why this concert is so difficult to find and buy.  It was definately worth the wait, and certainly worth the cost.  David Foster simply is a musical genius, and it is obvious all the stars he has touched are very close to him.  Oh yeah, the picture and dts master sound were absolutely perfect.  Small update:  I think I figured out why this is hard to find on the Amazon website.  It's listed as cd/blu ray under music instead of bluray/cd in movies.  It should come up either way.  Please enjoy!!!

1594203059|3.0|Didn't we tread this way before with Kenneth Clark in \\"Civilization\\" and Michael Wood in \\"Legacy,  the Origins of Civilization ?\\"  Every thirty years, a learned British historian comes on PBS Sunday after Sunday, usually during fund raising season, educating us, colonists, about the roots of our Western Civilization. The series is invariably accompanied by a book, text and photos, favorably reviewed by the Times, but marked by either the shallowness of its text or the randomness of the author's approach to history.  Niall Ferguson's \\"Civilization\\" appears to be that book with a catch; it is an argumentative brief packaged with catchy phrases like \\" apps\\" to describe the historical causes and effects to edify our twenty first century sensibilities.  Ferguson synthesizes his history drawing from many sources, picking and choosing random events forging them together, sometimes helter skelter, to make his point. The meandering artistic erudition of Kenneth Clark does not fit Ferguson's ramped up, fly over approach to historiography. Not given to original research, he reads widely, has  a formidable and forceful command of the English language, and draws from many modern  historians to tell his tale. The reign of Frederick the Great is extolled as a time of innovation and military discipline; his source is Christopher Clark's masterful history of the Prussia Empire.  For the intellectual strength of European cultures, he repackages  Charles Murray's  \\"Human Accomplishment\\" on his categorization of ethnic traits.<br /><br />His assuredness in writing, however,  is not matched by his fact checking.  For example, his statement that \\"Thomas Jefferson is only the most famous American to have fathered children by one of his slaves\\" has been debunked by contemporary research.  The Sally Hemings affair, to which he alludes, has been subjected to ''serious skepticism'' by Jeffersonian scholars for over a decade and has been scientifically rebutted by the distinguished Scholars Commission in a lengthy final report.  Ferguson, as a historian writing on American themes, should have been sensitive to this long standing controversy, or, otherwise softened his assertive language on such a fiery topic to many Americans.<br /><br />Some chapters are focused and thought provoking (his discussion of the philosophy of Edmund Burke on the American and French Revolutions and on Max Weber and the centrality of Christianity); others are wordy and rambling. His chapter on medicine is less about the contributions of Western medicine in Africa than a withering attack on the French and German imperialism in Africa (while ignoring England's imperialistic activities  in South Africa). His fondness for statistics is his rhetorical hammer to drive home his points and it gets tedious. His charts are unattributed. He frequently dots his analysis with cryptic references and short blurbs (a reference to a Larkin poem, but no poem, an all but obscure reference to the main character in a Turgenev book but no connection), leaving the reader adrift as to their meaning. One senses a sparkling and forceful intellect, a driving need to bring forth the insights of others, both modern and obscure,  but the question for this reader is:  is this a book or a television script for the upcoming series?  Is his mention of Wenzhou, China to be a stopping off point in his upcoming series and is this why it is mentioned? Survey books, bent by the demands of a television production,  tend to skewer the story line but on the other hand are often and commendably jumping off points for further readings and,  surely,  Ferguson fulfils that need in this book. But, while his judgments and observations are provocative and fascinating this is not the easiest book to admire.in a lengthy final report.

B004EBT5CU|4.0|She's so soulful. This degree of honest vocal artistry is what's missing from the contemporary music scene. Adele's vocal style honors those jazz, blues, r&b and rock artists who came before her without coming across as too nostalgic, yet her tone is fresh and awakening.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|The Black Keys album brothers is something I bought and I have to say that I love the music they brought to the table, my favorite songs in the album is \\"tighten up\\" and \\"howlin' for you\\" those two would be the best in the album the rest of them are good and overall the album is a great album ...but it doesn't stop there.  here the thing when I first got the cd it all black with black text but after I put it my computer and burn some music out of it (for my mp3 player) when I take it amazinly part of the cd turn white and the black text of the cd became visible! it turns out that the cd is design to react when hit with light when it being played but when it is back in the cover it turn back to black.  this got to be the most interesting album I ever gotten, forget downloading the music buy the CD instead you will love the music and have a interesting music cd that change it apperance. it will come in handle when doing a magic trick
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|One of the good ones.  It's probably the best he has written in a while.  Enjoyed very much.  I lived through most of this having been born in 1951, so some of it was like memory lane.  But, there were surprises.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I would like to recomend the movie to all my family and friends. It is a vey sweet and touching movie.
1444710338|4.0|Cant wait to read this book since it got here so fast, didnt even have a chance to talk myself out of the diet, Yet. Great Service i hope someone sees this and orders from them off my review alone. they will be very pleased period.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|It is hard for me to believe that you can really find another product with this good of quality for the price.  However, unless a product completely blows me away I will not give it a 5/5.  The biggest complaint I saw about this product was volume.  But, if you plug it into an mp3 recorder or something similar instead of just your laptop the sound is much louder.  Another small complaint is a bit too much noise, but this can easily be taken care of with a bit of tweaking in any audio software.  Overall, I think I may end up buying this product again, if the one I'm using now ever breaks.
B0011U8NZ2|4.0|I bought this CD a while ago and listened to it again today. It's very enjoyable if your in the mood for some REAL DOORS which by definition includes a Jim Morrison firmly in alcoholisms grip. Jim is well oiled but has not gotten totally smashed yet so it was a lucky night for the audience and us.   It has several very well done songs and very little junk.
B005POK858|5.0|I love the game and the graphics. It reminds me of the classic final fantasy. This game is pretty cool
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This is a good set of episodes V - VI for the casual viewer. For the person that is not interested in the details of the production but just wants a presentation of the story on Blue-ray.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The film is great, no spoilers here.  The extras are very interesting to me.    Especially the part about the goblins of Gringotts Bank which is a massive attempt to make the scene believable.  Really fun to watch the process and the creation of a brillant part of the movie.  Love it.  The imagination has no limits.  Good.  Interviews are plentiful.  And then there is the movie and that ending, that fine sweet ending.
B005JZBP8W|1.0|They seem to think that all they have to do is say Blu-ray to sell a classic film for the 4th time.  First there was the VHS tape, then the Laser Disc, followed by the DVD (2 releases)and now comes THE Blu-ray.  However, this Blu-ray is DEFECTIVE!  While it's possible for any film transfer to have little problems once in a while, this problem runs through the entire film.  What's more disturbing is that they cared so little for what might just be, the BEST AMERICAN MUSICAL EVER MADE.  And if \\"My Fair Lady\\" isn't the best, then it's \\"West Side Story\\", but in either case, \\"My Fair Lady\\" deserved more respect then to pass off an old defective transfer to master this new Blu-ray release.  While there are a number of problems with this Blu-ray release, the worst of the problems run from beginning to end and affects about 20% of each side of the picture.  It appears as a loss of contrast when compared to the center of the screen.  In some parts of the film it appears to become even worse.  It would appear that regular DVD's look better than this new Blu-ray.    If accurate aspect ratios are important to you, this Blu-ray of what was originally a 70mm Super Panavision film, should have an aspect ratio of 2.20:1, if it had been transferred from a 65mm negative or 70mm print.  This Blu-ray disc is 2.35:1, indicating it was originally transferred from a 35mm print.  They might have gotten away with the 2.35:1 AR transfer, had it not been a poorly done defective low resolution transfer, having a little too much edge enhancement, which can be annoying at best.   \\"My Fair Lady\\", which was originally made by Warner Bros. and personally produced by then Warner Bros. head, Jack L. Warner, was, at 17 million dollars, one of the most expensive films ever made at that time.  However, Warner Bros. is NOT responsible for the production and sale of this defective Blu-ray, that dishonor goes to CBS/Paramount.  I'm sure if that if Mr.Warner could see what was done to his \\"Fair Lady\\" with this Blu-ray, he would turn over in his grave.  This Blu-ray has a rating of \\"D\\" for DON'T BUY....until they come out with a Blu-ray that is befitting \\"A Lady\\".

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|Chris Evans is getting around the super hero circuit. First he took his turn as Johnny Storm in two Fantastic Four films and now he's emerged as Captain America. (Supposedly he's contracted to \\"appear\\" in six movies)  I think the biggest problem with this movie is the director. The only Joe Johnston movie I enjoyed was the perfect Rocketeer. I thought Jurassic Park 3 was a franchise-killer, Hildalgo - bleh. And nevermind The Wolfman.  I thought it was great to do a period film when showing the origins of Captain America and staying with the original comics. However I found the pacing to be a bit off. I was actually bored with most of this movie. Every character seemed very bland. Even the fantastic Hugo Weaving was demoted to half-a-second moments.  While I did enjoy this movie more than Thor, I'm not sure what I should expect from Marvel and their super hero movies anymore. If this was a tease of what's to come in The Avengers, I shudder.  On the plus side, this does equal summer fun. There isn't anything questionable as far as content. I was just hoping for more super in this hero. Let's hope we'll get that in The Avengers and the next Captain movie.
B005POK858|5.0|Bright me back to the early final fantasies. Map are no help though.  Can anyone tell me where the red key is?

1451648537|4.0|I choose to buy this book, is not to know Steve's Personality/life. What I really want to know is, why it is him, but not others, can save Apple, make Apple so successful. His personality cannot account for this. Neither can his passion for design.  So I am looking for the details of technique innovation. I want to know how he motivated people, how people brought up ideas for new technique/products, and how technique bottleneck was cracked. I didn't get the answer from this book.  Another thing is: the book describes unbelievablely briefly about Steve's early life, especially his childhood; but put too many sentences on a lot of unnecessary details of his late life. Thus, the first half part of book is informative; while the second half is a little boring.  Walter Isaacson should have put more efforts on this book. Steve Jobs deserves this.
0307891402|5.0|This is by far one of the best - if not the best - guides ever created.  Intricate detail, tons of info on all the quests, items, locations and everything else in the game.  The digital map code is worth paying the extra money to get the CE version over the paperback.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I have used this case for two days now, and am impressed with it. Most of the cases on the market for the fire dramatically increase the size of the whole package. True, the propping up aspect is a little touchy (the cover end is placed inside a small notch in the back of the case), but I have now watched hours of video with the device propped up in this fashion, and it has performed well; the more time you spend propping it up, the easier the case \\"finds its groove.\\" Keeping in mind the design philosophy of this case, which is to protect the Fire with a minimal increase in overall dimensions, Marware has done a great job here.  I was one of those who preordered this case and paid $40 for it. In a classy move, Amazon just sent me an email indicating that my account would be credited $10 to bring this into parity with the current sales price of this item.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I do not like Justin Bieber one bit, but this album is the best thing i have every heard. I am into the Beatles and Michael Jackson and i mean my daughter made me buy her this and i told her it was stupid and horrible and she doesn't need it  but now that i have emialed it i can't believe my ears. The best thing i have ever heard in my life. i am a 40 year old women and now i am in love with Justin Bieber. I can't even believe i just said that :)
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had this case for my iphone 4s (white) and it fits great! No issues with it whatsoever. I feel like it's the PERFECT balance between being protective but not too bulky. Not a huge fan of the circled design on the back, but it's really a very minor issue. I had literally spent HOURS reading reviews on TONS of different cases, and I am very happy I ended up getting this one. The case is very good quality and it's considerably less expensive than most other cases. I highly recommend!
B005K2XM94|5.0|After my Kindle Fire was delivered, I realized that I really needed some kind of a case to protect it when I carried it anywhere. I wanted something that would provide reasonably good protection, easy to open and close, and was inexpensive. The Timbuk2 Kindle Fire Envelope Sleeve appeared to meet those requirements, so I ordered it (FYI, I ordered it in black).<br /><br />I'm very pleased with the Timbuk2. It doesn't provide all the protection that a more rigid cover or case would, but it's a good value for the price, and I think that for occasionally carrying the Fire away from the house, it should be fine. The foam that the sleeve is made from appears to be durable and thick enough to give adequate protection against an accidental bump or a ding.<br /><br />The velcro flap with two strips of velcro works well, and I actually prefer it to a zipper, which could be broken or stuck. The Fire fits snugly inside, but it slips in and out easily.<br /><br />If I could change anything about the sleeve, I would have added a short carrying strap, but the outside of the sleeve is textured enough to make it easy to grip.<br /><br />I noticed that the sleeve is approved by Amazon for use with the Kindle Fire.<br />--------------------------------------------<br />Update 9-15-12: The new Kindle Fire HD, 7\\" model, is a slightly different size/shape, but it will fit in the sleeve.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|Great movie, if you are buying this you probably already know its a quality film.  That said, the Digital Copy is garbage.  You will be forced to download a proprietary software program in order to watch the film.  WILL NOT work with iTunes or any other player.  This was a really bad idea.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Disney's most engaging animated feature receives the royal treatment on this outstanding Blu-Ray release.  Always known for great video transfers, Disney has outdone itself here.  Fabulous picture quality, inky black levels and peerless audio.  If you're looking for the perfect Blu-Ray demo disc, look no further.  This is it.
038533348X|3.0|The only criticism I have of this book is that, as the number of people who interpret the story as one against science and the perceived futility of knowledge shows, it is too easily misinterpreted. As well the story doesn't have the same urgency as, say, Slaughterhouse-Five. But that's really nitpicking on the story, isn't it?
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|So I've always bought three discs of my favorite movies, just because I like the quick accessibility on my laptop, but my experience with the UltraViolet \\"Digital Copy\\" has been less than satisfactory.  I have no idea what WB was thinking, but when I tell the Flixster Collections app to download it for iTunes, it only seems interested in downloading in .mp4 format all the while trying to convince me that this is an iTunes file, which is not only frustrating because it's not in the typical .m4v movie format, but it won't even show up anywhere in my iTunes library. I wonder if WB gave up on the codes in exchange for giving iTunes extras? Maybe I'll have to shell out an extra $15 for a decent digital copy?   I've been sitting here for over an hour trying to get a proper download and nothing has worked. Frankly, I find this all very off putting. I feel like the only thing that I've gotten out of this is a hard copy of the movie in both blue-ray and standard. WB, if you're listening, knock it off and just give me my iTunes code for this movie. Things go much more smoothly when you keep it simple. Just skip the hassle and don't bother with the three disc. Get it on Standard or Blue-Ray and be done with it.  Sorry WB, I love the movie, but Ultra-Violet/Flixster is a big mistake.
B005POK858|5.0|love this game! got it as the free app of the day. Graphical reminiscent of Final Fantasy or Fire Emblem!
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|My definition of a great movie is that I would pay to own the DVD after watching it at the theatre or renting out of Redbox for a dollar! I definitely bought this movie. A wonderful comedy, love story with a twist!
B0055SWM08|2.0|It's just boring, they need to add music variety and change up the sounds a bit. This game is for like grandmas or special needs
B0064J6OMO|1.0|I just HATE when you watch a movie trailer and you think you are going to see a comedy that may not have the most unique story-line but you love the actors and can't wait to sit back and be entertained and then WHAM right off the bat you are bombarded with the F--- word and bad acting and an excuse to show nudity that doesn't add anything to the film at all. This movie tanks.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|For those who remember the Atari 2600, the original one-button joystick that always broke, and those goofy paddles, this is for you. The app downloaded and installed fine on my EVO 3D. When first starting up, I was greeted by a really cool layout where each game is shown like you remember from the video arcades. Missile Command comes free, the rest you have to buy.   For those who gave the 1 and 2 star reviews for only getting one game, shame on you. It clearly states it in the description. You didn't rate this app properly, you're showing how cheap you are. Users can buy 100 games for $10 or singles for a dollar. Trying this out first is smart. If Atari just sold an all inclusive $10 app, you'd whine about not being able to try it first to see if it works on your device.   In closing, if you're the nostalgic type and want to relive those old school Atari memories, this is perfect. So far, I've only tried Missile Command and it was perfect. Exactly like I remember it.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|I can only write that this is not compatible with an Android tablet such as the Vizio 8\\" vtab. It will not work even though it says it should by specs of the tablet. It let me download it and then tried to upgrade and said the App was not compatible. Removed.
B005JLN9ZI|3.0|Overproduced. uneven. every song is stealing from kanye's latest. The kid got talent but still...  I'll wait for J cole's sophomore album. At least he has something to say, and oh yea, he produces all his stuff.
0470570954|5.0|Study this book, read whatever they give you.  I actually ended up with 3 copies of this book, 2 older versions, and this one.  It still gets borrowed often, which means, people use it and learn from it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great show.  Great characters.  Great dialogue.  It shouldn't have been cancelled.  The Blu-Ray version is oustanding! You won't be disappointed.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|That is the rating I would give this weak bait and switch if i could since that is the number of games you get to play for &quot;free&quot;.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I'd rank this film up there with 1976's \\"Rocky\\":  It's tough, violent, and brutal, but it has underlying gentleness and heart.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't have gone to see this film had I not already seen Tom Hardy in \\"Bronson\\" (my one-word review of his performance in that: \\"WOW!\\").  Hardy is impressive both as an actor and as someone who can physically transform himself.  He added some 40 pounds of muscle for this role, looking quite fearsome and imposing.  Hard to believe this is the same guy who played \\"Twombly\\" in \\"Black Hawk Down\\" -- there is almost no resemblance.<br /><br />Hardy and actor Joel Edgerton play estranged brothers who, via different paths and with different motivations, enter a winner-take-all mixed martial arts tournament.  Both brothers were trained in their youth by their father Paddy (Nick Nolte, excellent as always) and both resent him because of his abusive, alcoholic nature.<br /><br />The martial arts fighting gives the film its energy and action, but the family dynamic gives the film its heart.  The film never stoops to weepy melodrama, as many other sports movies with similar concepts have.  The characters -- even the supporting ones -- are sufficiently fleshed out and believable:  they are the connective tissue keeping the entire body in good shape.<br /><br />There are one or two moments in the cage that stretch believability just a tad, but they are essential to moving the story to its inevitable showdown.  Knowing what's at stake for the two finalists, I think we can forgive the filmmakers for that.<br /><br />Director Gavin O'Connor proved with his 2004 movie \\"Miracle\\" (about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team battling the Soviets) that he knows how to make a great sports movie that puts the characters at center stage.  O'Connor has done it again with \\"Warrior\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended.  It's as great a sports movie as \\"Miracle\\", \\"Rocky\\", \\"Hoosiers\\", and \\"Rudy\\", movies that all were more about personal triumph than sports victory.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I had pre-ordered this set and was very much looking forward to the Blu-ray discs.  When I opened the set and flipped through the discs, it seemed as if this set was just put together with other blu ray discs from other packaging.  The discs look nothing like the pics on the order site.  Order of the Phoenix even says DISC 1 and DH part one cover looks like it was bought off the street... not what I expected.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I gave this one 5 stars because I know how long it took for Drake to grow on me. Track 15 is by far Drake at his deepest when he talks about his mother and what they went through before he finally got noticed. As for track one, one of the best opening tracks I've heard on an album in recent years. Yes, Drake talked about sex and money on this album, but at the same time, he also showed how he can stand on his own a little bit(lyrically) without sounding like Weezy so much.For example, the track where he portrays a guy who lets the alcohol allow him feed \\"Hail Mary\\" (4th Down) caliber lines to his ex. Now a lot of brothers wouldn't go as far as Drake did on this track when it comes to realizing what you had when it's gone. That's why I had to tip my hat to Drake, because he verbally went in on a level that most ex-boyfriends at fault would be too prideful to reach in real life. So to sum it up, for a guy who is still not a die-hard Drake fan, he did indeed \\"Take Care\\" of this album's material. And that's where I was impressed. Take care...
B0065GG2ZK|5.0|Drake is a unique talent - he is one of the most talented lyricists of all time. Clever, bold, deep and intense. This album encapsulates everything we know and love about Drake. The emotional intensity, swagger, deep tones and introspection are heartfelt and this is an album you can either chill out to or get you pumped up. It's dynamic, aggressive and filled with the intellectual depth Drake is so good at conveying through his music. This is one of Drake's best - I recommend this 110%. Buy it, listen, share it, love it.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|For real Roots fans, all I have to say is this, Dear God alone makes the album worth buying. My dude, Phonte's appearances don't hurt at all, either. This album got robbed of a Grammy. Thanks a lot, Blueprint 3. Smh, wow.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|[[ASIN:B002L5GQGY Joe Bonamassa Live from the Royal Albert Hall]]  This is an amazing DVD...we could watch it every day.  What a talent...just wish he would do a concert close to Nashville, Tennessee. Great performance and well presented. This young man is the best I have ever heard.  Has amazing abilities along with a soleful voice.  Touches my heart.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Sometimes you just need a place to store private information such as passwords and so on. I find this is great! and I love the color coding system.
B00314VYNE|5.0|My daughter loves this doll. Yes the hat won't stay on but for the price I paid for it I think it's more than worth it. It's not cheap and it looks like it'll last my daughter for some time! Very happy with this purchase!
B005HEUD7O|4.0|Season 4: I'm not sure what happened with this season, it was good and maybe some of my fellow trekkers will disagree, but it seemed like the writers just wanted this season to be full of one character story lines. \\"Family\\" is a Picard episode, \\"Brothers\\" is a Data (Brent Spiner plays three characters for goodness sake), \\"Suddenly Human\\" Picard, \\"Remember Me\\" Beverly Crusher, \\"Reunion\\" Worf, \\"Future Imperfect\\" and \\"First Contact\\" Riker, \\"Data's Day\\" Obvious. It wasn't every episode but a larger chunk than normal. Hence the four-star instead of five.
B0065GG2ZK|3.0|My first bad move was reading the Pitchfork review. In their typical machete-generalized way of talking they compared this album to \\"Here My Dear.\\" I think they were trying to draw a comparison for how Marvin changed from \\"What's Going On,\\" becoming more sure of himself and trying to navigate the trappings of fame as a more realized artist.<br /><br />But that's not what I'm seeing here. I love a slow album with twists and turns but I find myself zoning out and actually nodding off a lot here. On \\"Thank Me Later\\" Drake had great burners like \\"Shut it Down\\" and \\"Up All Night\\" which had character and form--if maybe a little too much repetition. Here so many of the slower songs just blur together. But beyond instrumentation, I don't see a massively evolved sense of self in the lyrics. I mean some of his rhymes have gotten wittier but not so much that I'm blown away.<br /><br />I'm really impressed Drake took a step like this--it's bold. And I get how people will say how he's taken XX-like vibes and made a more adult album but I just miss the old Drake.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|My favorite R.E.M. Songs - Carnival of Sorts, Letter Never Sent, Exhuming McCarthy, Superman, Crush with Eyeliner, All the way to Reno, Revolution, Just a Touch and Wanderlust didn't even make it on the album (Ok Supernatural Superserious and Pop Song 89 made it).  An incredible musical group - something here for everyone.  Plus who else would put a reference to \\"Shakes the Clown\\" in a song title (Binky the doormat) - For that - they deserve immortality...The future never happened.......
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Just as good or better then the $30 - $40 cases you get at Best Buy or the Apple Store. If these ever come back in stock, I recommend you order one ASAP. They won't last long.
0451232577|5.0|Fall of Giants begins with a six page cast of characters; it is, after all, Book One of a Century Triology. I found the cast pages too intimidating, so I dove right into the book at Chapter One. Within the first several pages I was thoroughly engrossed, and even after nearly one thousand pages, I never had to consult the six page character list.  Every character in the novel is distinct and fascinating, and represents a country or viewpoint of the world leading up to and through WWI. Most notably, but not exclusively, there are the working-class coal miners from Wales, the British aristocrats, the Russian nobility and peasantry, the militaristic upper class Germans, and the political Americans. The lives of the men and women from each level of society and every country are intertwined by work and love, and Follett brilliantly uses his characters to demonstrate how class warfare, passion, and pride led to the the first World War.  Follett is a master plotter. He keeps the reader riveted on every page of his thousand page novels because every single scene is full of tension, fascinating circumstances, memorable characters, and graphic detail. Nothing is spared, and you will flinch, cry, gasp, and blush many times throughout the novel. His prose is so vivid that it plays like a movie, and this will, I hope, become a series as his earlier novels have.  If you enjoy epic novels of love and war, I highly recommend Fall of Giants. My only complaint is that I have to wait until next fall to read the sequel.
B0012GTZFC|2.0|I'm reading this in parallel with the Good to Great bestseller and am rather disapointed with both books' contribution to the corporate ideosphere. I wouldn't go as far as to say I feel robbed after this acquisition, but I definitely wouldn't rank these as invaluable CEO bedside material.  If you must read one book on corporate leadership, THIS IS NOT the one. Focus your attention on tried but true Dale Carneggie. Another door into the leader's mind is leaders' biographies - Ben Franklin, W. Buffett, Lincoln...  Cut out the middle man and go to the source.
B005L38QHA|2.0|Out of the box I wanted to like this mouse, I really did. Unfortunately it was not to be.  If you have large hands, you probably already know what I'm going to say here - it's not made for you. Personally I have medium-sized hands so the fit wasn't too bad for me, but my roommate deemed it unfit for large handed-users. He's also the only currently subscribed WoW player, so I let him take it for a spin. He pretty much had the same opinion as me - the buttons are all over the place and don't really feel intuitive. If you don't mind a mouse that requires that you conform to its use, then you might be ok with this Gaming Mouse. If you're like me and feel that ergonomics should be considered and button use should be almost instinctive instead of mechanical, this mouse is not for you. During normal day-to-day usage I found myself accidentally clicking the random assortment of buttons on this mouse. In WoW, if you have nothing mapped - it's not bad, but trying to use this mouse's advanced function mapping makes this thing a nightmare for casual usage. If you give yourself a few weeks of hard usage, you will grow used to where the buttons are. If that's too much time for you to invest in a mouse, skip this one.  If you have large hands - keep looking, this is not the mouse you are looking for.
B0058DRUV6|2.0|I'm rather disapointed with this books' contribution to the corporate ideosphere. Apart from the rare dripplets of water to the mill, I definitely do not feel smarter after this acquisition. This is not CEO bedside material.  Mr Collins takes annoying shortcuts through corporate intricacies and lays out platitude after platitude of before and after scenarios, when all we really want to know is the juicy in-between voyage.   Mr Collins tries to whet your appetite with boggling stock performances at every page and wild success stories, with very little consideration for macro-economy, competitive and legislative environment and internal politics and struggles.  Even more annoying are easy handed attributions that undermine the book's credibility, like one executive who emphasizes how plans are useless but planning is invaluable - Mr Collins doesn't feel the need to footnote that this is Eisenhower's one-liner.  If you must read one book on corporate leadership, THIS IS NOT the one. Focus your attention on tried but true Dale Carneggie. Another door into the leader's mind is leaders' biographies - Ben Franklin, W. Buffett, Lincoln...  Cut out the middle man and go to the source.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Chris Evans becomes America's ultimate weapon against evil in the fun-filled superhero adventure Captain America: The First Avenger. In the 1940s, headstrong Steve Rogers (Evans) volunteers for a top secret government experiment that transforms him from a scrawny weakling into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. Captain America leads the fight for freedom against the evil HYDRA organization and their leader Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who has discovered an otherworldly power that will ensure him world domination. Captain America: The First Avenger is the latest comic book adaptation to hit the big screen, and is certainly a playful action-packed romp. Though not a comic book masterpiece, it does succeed in capturing the spirit of what a comic book movie should be. Director Joe Johnston has created a stylish old-fashioned adventure picture with some solid elements of drama, humor and action. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />If you're a fan of comic book heroes or good old-fashioned adventure, then Captain America: The First Avenger is a highly recommended addition to your Blu-Ray collection. The comic book blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. Though not the sharpest transfer of any Paramount releases, the movie still looks fantastic with fine detail and vivid colors. The 7.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack delivers fine clarity, well balanced surround effects and good bass. The Blu-Ray features a nice variety of extras: audio commentary track with director Joe Johnston and production crew, five minutes of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, the short film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, and six behind-the-scenes and in-depth comic book featurettes. Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger scores a \\"B+\\".
B001NLKWLW|2.0|Whew!  And in actuality there are few books I don't finish...but there were times when I was frustrated and tempted not to.  Following the three (and up to 6 different characters) different story lines took too much effort. This wasn't helped by the fact that I never cared at all for Nell...who the entire book revolved around. I could see by the reviews that some people loved it, but I struggled.  I would rather recommend Winter Sea....by Susanna Kearsley, your money would be more satisfyingly spent.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|In the summer of 1993, director Stephen Spielberg once again made cinematic history with big screen release of Jurassic Park, a thrilling Sci-Fi adventure based on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton. The film centers on an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs in a remote tropical island and stared by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson. Upon its theatrical release, \\"Jurassic Park\\" was well received by critics and audiences whom praised the film's impressive special effects. It grossed over 900 million dollars worldwide and received three Academy Awards: Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.<br /><br />After such success, it was pretty obvious that Universal Pictures would want to continue the new Sci-Fi franchise and two sequels were released: The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Jurassic Park III (2001).<br /><br />The Lost World: Jurassic Park stared Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Schiff, Vince Vaughn and Richard Attenborough, and for the most part, it is a pretty solid sequel. Beside some mixed reviews, it earned over 618 million dollars worldwide.<br /><br />For Jurassic Park III, Joe Johnston stepped up to the director's chair while Spielberg took over the duties of executive producer. The third entry of the franchise was somewhat of a disappointment, compared to the first two films. Although \\"Jurassic Park III\\" grossed about half of the previous film, it was still considered a commercial hit.<br /><br />The new Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy Blu-Ray set certainly stands out as one of the must have Blu-Ray releases of 2011. All three films are presented in their original 1.85:1 widescreen format. As far as picture quality, the transfers look great, a considerable upgrade over the DVDs. The 7.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack is outstanding. The 3 Blu-Ray set come very well equipped with an ample variety of extras: many behind-the-scenes and special effects documentaries, storyboards, deleted scenes, picture galleries, production archives, theatrical trailers and a feature commentary by special effects crew (Jurassic Park III). Overall, Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy scores an \\"A-\\".ects documentaries, storyboards, deleted scenes, picture galleries, production archives, theatrical trailers and a feature commentary by special effects crew (Jurassic Park III).

B004XN3FHA|4.0|Just received this item a few weeks ago and on first inspection I can see that it is well made and well designed.  The light output is amazing on the max setting. I haven't had a chance to really evaluate the performance and durability over time so for now I would have to give it 3 1/2 to 4 stars.

B005JZBP8W|1.0|OBITUARY:  On November 15,2011 Blu-Ray consumers bore witness to the still-born deliveries of \\"My Fair Lady\\" and \\"West Side Story\\".  It was a mournful day.  Clearly, the past promises of Blu-Ray and all that is was meant to be - mainly perfection - has been abandoned and reduced to a text-book marketing ploy for The Emperor's New Clothes and all the off-the-rack deceptions that come with it.  I don't believe for a moment that the corrections needed on the Blu-Ray release of \\"West Side Story\\" will ever be rectified by the distributor.  Their so-called variation on a recall of this faulty Blu-Ray transfer will prove to be nothing more than a placating or string-along PR scam; as such corrections, I suspect, could lead to a lengthy and indefinite time period.  Without resolution, a couple more years will pass and, I suspect, we will enevitably discover that our hands will be forced into the realm of triple-dipping to get what we were initially promised on Noverber 15th.  They got your money, folks...and we are stuck.  Don't get me wrong; I am well aware that some of our classic films are in trouble and may never be able to attain the perfection I am addressing; on the other hand, my criticisms of \\"WEST SIDE STORY\\" and \\"MY FAIR LADY\\" are justified.  BOTH films have received the red-carpet restoration treatment within their 70mm negatives; and the Blu-Ray movement has irreversably proven what was possible with such standard-bearer transfers as \\"The Sound of Music\\"; so...all and all, it's much too late for the Blu-Ray movement to begin its retreat.  Such lost experiences include the Blu-Ray OMISSION of the newly discovered Oscar winning 6-Track sound design from the 70mm Roadshow version of \\"WEST SIDE STORY\\"; which just further mutes and diminishes the joyous sounds one would hope to hear at a 50th Anniversary party.  The excuses made for the 6-track omission are weak and unacceptable...something to do with costs...but what could be more costly than the mass marketing ofa Blu-Ray title that morally needs to be recalled due to its poor supervision and lack-luster transfer?  The same aforementioned morals charge must also by applied ten-fold to the Blu-Ray transfer of \\"MY FAIR LADY\\"  I mainly mourn for the restoration team of Harris and Katz; who spent, I believe, up to two years of their efforts in bringing back to pristine life the 70mm negative; which had nearly become extinct.  One would think - with preservation and perfection in mind - that the 1994 Harris/Katz acheivement fused with the possibilites of Blu-Ray would have been a match made in heaven...but CBS/Fox/Paramount did not confer with this source restoration team; leaving each and everyone one of us at the Blu-Ray alter.  The \\"MY FAIR LADY\\" supplements contain a fantastic 1994 insight into what Harris and Katz were up against in saving the 70mm negative; ironically, though, we do not get to experience the optimum results of their efforts.  It's not the fault of Harris and Katz...they did their job.  I believe their goal was to preserve \\"My Fair Lady\\" for future generations; and, ironially, that next generation of supervisors did not take advantage of the gift that was passed down to them.  This weakened transfer of the restored 70mm print onto Blu-Ray was in the hands of an entirely different team.  What this Blu-Ray team did to this transfer was equal to Higgins charges to Eliza when first hearing her accent; [it was]\\"the cold bloody murder of the English tounge\\". Blu-Ray promised to give us the optimum State-Of-The-Art experience in sight and sound...and I would like to experience \\"My Fair Lady\\" in all its Loverly breadth and detail.  The Blu-Ray transfer team of \\"MY FAIR LADY\\" did little for our Miss Dolittle.  Perhaps, as consumers, we should no longer participate or invest our monies in the Pre-Order Sales programs...as consumers we should simply wait until the Blu-Ray reviews are in.  Perhaps, with a boycotting of Blu-Ray Pre-Order Sales it will ensure that the standards of restoration and transfers onto Blu-Ray remain in check.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I just saw \\"Breaking Dawn\\" part 1, and I was VERY impressed, even if as a man I am probably not the most typical fan of \\"Twilight\\" series. I rather liked all the \\"Twilight\\" movies until now and this one is, to my personnal taste, as good as the previous ones - and even in one aspect a little bit better, as Edward and Bella finally become lovers. Below, you will find a short description of what I believe are the best elements of this film, with limited SPOILERS:<br /><br />1. Actors. All actors evolved as the serie continued and I believe they all got better with time. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are both excellent, but - in my humble opinion - it is Kristen Stewart who in this movie shines the most. Quite a lot of people frequently criticized her actorship claiming that she simply can not play at all and has a very limited assortment of expressions in her tool box. But for me, after reading \\"Twilight\\" books, this is how the character of Bella should be. I can hardly picture her wide smiling with all her teeth bared or doing any other highly extraverted things like that. In fact I believe that either by design or by accident Kristen Stewart got the things right about this character - her minimalistic approach to facial expressions actually makes (for me) Bella very believable and also quite likeable. In this part of the story, Bella takes a more dynamic approach to life by taking her destiny firmly under control. She makes important decisions and takes extreme risks, stubbornly resisting the opposite advice of all her family and friends - all of that in a deceptively unassuming way... And Kristen Stewart acted in the movie exactly as I pictured Bella did it, when I read the books. A very good job!<br /><br />Other actors are also great, with Ashley Greene and Billy Burke being as usual the pillars - but amongst the supporting roles it is Nikki Reed who really gets the most praise from me. She has a much bigger role in this film and she is perfect in it! The one (little) disappointment is Jackson Rathbone, who changed comletely his haircut for this film and as a result his character, Jasper, seems much less impressive, which is a pity. He also seems to appear very little in the \\"first line\\", almost as if the director preferred to hide him a little...<br /><br />2. Visual aspects. As usual, the images of state of Washington are great, but the tropical island where Bella and Edward spend their honey moon is also very pleasantly showed. Dark forests filled with (were)wolves are very much present here and they are a great background for the story.<br /><br />3. Music. As usual in those series, music and songs have been selected very carefully and with a great taste.<br /><br />4. The (were)wolf pack. The Quileute wolves are shown here even more and better than in the previous part. The scene of their war council, when they are all in the werewolf form, is absolutely great! The scene when Sam (the alpha male) asserts and confirms his power over the pack is excellent - as good as the description of Jacob's defiance and its consequences.<br /><br />5. The wedding. A very nice and moving scene with some humour elements, especially when the guests make speeches offering toasts. Emmett, Jessica and Bella's father give here a great show. In the same time Mike Newton obsesses on vampire bridesmaids from the Denali clan, to the point of drooling (and I TOTALLY understand him!). Bella's mum and, suprprise surprise, Rosalie (!) are also real treasures in wedding scenes.<br /><br />6. Quileute wolves vs. Cullen coven confrontation. This heartbreaking, tense and at moments violent conflict in which both sides are trapped against their will is a great moment in the Twilight saga - and its final resolution is even better! Finally it is true what the Beatles were singing - all you need is love! Babies help too...<br /><br />7. The fight for Bella's life, Renesmee's bloody birth and Bella's fate - excellent! Those were moments very difficultto film - but the challenge was met succesfully! Nothing more about it to avoid more spoilers, but I was very impressed!<br /><br />Conclusion: it is an excellent movie which I watched with great pleasure. My wife, who usually is a much harder person to please, loved it too and she is going to see it again with some girlfriends. And we will certainly both wait with great expectations for the \\"Breaking dawn\\" part 2. If it was done as well as that one, it will be certainly worth waiting one year to see it...bout it to avoid more spoilers, but I was very impressed!

159514188X|5.0|This was a great book for me and my 13 year old to read.  We had awesome conversations about how words and actions can unknowingly and knowingly create such turmoil in others.  I think it was a trigger for her to pay attention to her words with others.  I felt a connection with the girl and I'm 36- I remember how hard it was in highschool and being treated similar to this.  This would be a good book club book
B001QWBM62|3.0|If you are buying this unit because you think you are going to plug in XLR Mics forget it!  Don't take my word for it, do your homework, it's all over the net! This device works great  and is a great value using the on board mics. However, the crappy preamps in this unit make the   XLR inputs virtually useless. Not enough gain for a usable recording and so much his when the gain   is at 100% that it sounds like a ocean in the background!   Did you notice Zoom left out ALL specifications regarding single to noise ratios? Now, don't you think   that is a bit odd considering that it is just about the most important single specification imaginable for   this kind of device? I for one am really pissed off that they conned people into thinking they could use  the XLR inputs. I have tried more than a dozen different professional XLR condenser mics and they all have the same  problem, not enough gain, enormous amount of hiss. Again, do your homework first!  If you're the on board mics on this unit, it great, and quiet(for the price) beyond belief!

159420229X|5.0|I was in a rush so I bough this book because I thought I was a self-help book. I was looking at another memory improvement book when I decided to click on the memory improvement category in which is was listed. This book was #1 in the category. I simply click and ship (Okay, not that fast but almost instantly).  When I got the book I was expecting to find drills, and explanation of the memory, case history, and etc. Instead it was more about how Joshua Foer became interested in improving his memory; eventually he become a memory champion winner (MA). Although not what I had originally wanted. The book does help to serve an a inspiration in my own journey towards my own self-improvement.  What I do find interesting is the similarity between the Memory techniques presented in this book (ancient scriptures, and modern book) on how to improve memory, and natural eye-sight improvement techniques that Dr. William Bates had devised. If you're are interested in natural eyesight improvement there William Bates \\"Better Eyesight\\", and or \\"Relearning to See\\" by Thomas Q.  On of the thing that William H Bates discovered is that when his patients had improved their eye-sight, generally their memories, and imagination improved. Both techniques (Memory, and eyesight improvement) are very similar. ((This is not too say that only people with perfect eye-sight have perfect memory. I know people who wear glasses who retentive memory))  [[ASIN:0805002413 The Bates Method for Better Eyesight Without Glasses]]  [[ASIN:1556433417 Relearning to See: Improve Your Eyesight Naturally!]]  [[ASIN:0486452530 Better Vision Now: Improve Your Sight with the Renowned Bates Method]]  Anyways, I would like to wish everyone good luck in their journey of memory improvement. Good Luck (:>

I had never heard of Nikki Blonsky before, and was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and honesty of her character as Tracy Turnblad.  Her spark and enthusiasm was riveting!  Moreover, John Travolta as her mom and Christopher Walken as her dad was priceless.  Despite the film's intended cheesiness, it was very well paced, and the production values are top notch.  I found myself smiling throughout, and getting into the characters and plot. All in all, a winner!
1451648537|4.0|Steve Jobs was a designer, an innovator, and creator of devices that have changed the way we insert ourselves into our digital world and how businesses can benefit from the creation and use of these devices. What's most interesting to me is how Walter Isaacson's book reveals Jobs' reality distortion field that formed the basis for his management style, but misses a reality distortion that I see in each of his revolutionary designs: most every device looks like a television screen from the 60's.<br /><br />Isaacson, in his video interview, mentions the Rashomon effect, where a large number of objective facts lead to various subjective accounts of these objective facts. In my read of Steve Jobs, I offer to describe another: where one person's vision of various personal devices all begin to look alike: rounded square corners. The Television Effect! From the early MacIntosh screen to the iPod and more, they all resemble a TV set, and while Jobs wanted to design devices that looked friendly, I might assume that Isaacson would have drawn a line from the Mac to the TV. From the moment I saw a Mac back in the 80's, I thought I was about to see an episode of Father Knows Best.<br /><br />After a few hundred pages, I began to sense that Jobs' greatest contribution might be to the Cupertino psychiatric community where so many of his underlings and former employees wrote checks to overcome the mercurial bravado of a man hellbent on publicly berating them with inspiring tag lines like \\"bozo\\" and \\"idiot,\\" terms he reserved for even his most brilliant competitors. I grew up down the street from Jobs at virtually the same time, and my father worked at Fairchild when guys like Andy Grove went off to form Intel, and Jerry Sanders started AMD. Jobs had the instincts of these great entrepreneurs and the savvy to surround himself with smart geeks who could pull off wizardry that he couldn't perform. He then took, or by his own admission, stole their ideas, put a TV set in front of it and made some hay. If I can be brave enough, I'm going to assume that Jobs, growing up as I did in the center of Geekville, may have had an unabiding fascination with the greatest electronic device of our time, the television set, where Ralph Cramden tore his best friend's head off and threatened to send Alice to the moon every week. He clearly loved the shape of it. The first colorfully transluscent ice cube shaped iMacs looked like they were missing nothing but a pair of rabbit ears.<br /><br />My other reservation with the book regards the treatment of his personal life, which in the balance is buried by facts surrounding his development of devices, which are self-contained and look alike, much like his wardrobe. I enjoyed drawing parallels between these two facets of his life, but I had to make some assumptions, and it's sad to note that his crying jags were most often reserved for business meetings. Did he cry at his kids' graduations, school plays, sporting events? Perhaps, but I had to draw that line, which turned out to be in the shape of a television set.<br /><br />I do like the book, but I would have profited by learning more about what Jobs liked to watch when he was kid. I'm betting, The Jetsons.I can be brave enough, I'm going to assume that Jobs, growing up as I did in the center of Geekville, may have had an unabiding fascination with the greatest electronic device of our time, the television set, where Ralph Cramden tore his best friend's head off and threatened to send Alice to the moon every week.

B005HGZV6U|2.0|I love DAFT PUNK: INTERSTELLA 5555 and took a shot with the Blu-ray even though I was aware of other reviewers' concerns. It would not play on my new Sony Blu-ray players. However, it did play on my Region free Blu-ray player but was not HD impressive. The case says the disc is 1080i25; a format I am unfamiliar with. My processor read that it was 1080p50. I noticed a lot of artifacts, even after processing to 1080p60, and am disappointed with the disc as a Blu-ray. I hope that a better Blu-ray release for Region 1 in 1080p24 will someday materialize.

B005OUARUO|3.0|I've given this CD 5 solid listens and trying to like it more as Feist is a good artist but, overall, I rate this 3 stars out of 5.  I can't really see some of the others rating it higher than that.    The first song, \\"The Bad In Each Other\\", is the best track on the CD.  The next track, \\"Graveyard\\", is the worst track on it but there would be a few songs on here contending for that honor.   My first Feist CD was \\"The Reminder\\" and that CD surprised me in how much I enjoyed it.  I found the singing and composition really original and fun.  This release starts off well and there are some good tracks here but there is a lot of other stuff that is not very good.  I would buy another Feist CD, though, as I believe she is talented and can create really entertaining and original music.
B00511PTWM|4.0|My car only has two power outlets; one in the front and one in the back. We frequently have to take long car trips and there never seems to be enough outlets for everyone to charge their phones/gps/ipod/dvd player/whatever. I really disliked having to choose between the gps or charging my phone so I'm really glad to get my hands on this adapter. It plugs in easily to your car's outlet and allows you to charge two devices instead of one. Nothing fancy, although the swivel function is a nice touch. There are no directions included so be careful trying to swivel it unless the button is depressed. My one complaint is that it's rather bulky, if it was just a bit smaller it'd be perfect. Overall, I'm considering buying a second one to have one in the front and one in the back. They'd also make a nice stocking stuffer for pretty much anyone on your list.
0805086846|2.0|This is a disingenuous book. Brown wrote in his preface that he \\"tried to fashion a narrative of the conquest of the American West  as the victims experienced it, using their own words whenever possible.\\" As a result he writes to put the Indians in the best light and the non-Indians in the worst, withholding information that would show the complexity of the relations between Indians and Whites in this period.<br /><br />To make this review explicit, I'll state some beliefs I have about this subject:<br /><br />(1) The North American Natives were doomed the moment the Europeans discovered the continent. Europe had technology and science, and therefore was far advanced over the North American Natives. It happened to take 400 years for the inevitable result of subjugation to play itself through.<br /><br />(2) The Indian Wars of the 19th century involved North American Natives that were living under the material and geographical influence of the European Americans, who themselves, as a people, had been on the continent for over 300 years. To go back to a pre-European influence, the Indians would have had to give up everything brought to them from Europe and the United States, including the horse, firearms and ammunition, knives, blankets, fabrics, cookware, and metalworks of many kinds. They would also have had to return to the areas of North America in which they had lived prior to the coming of the Europeans. Modern claims to land area based upon territory occupied in the late 19th century are without logical force.<br /><br />(3) The Indians wanted to maintain their trade with the Europeans and Americans, continuing to enrich their own lives with things they could not produce themselves, but they didn't want any encroachment of culture or people. They did not understand that this trade created a dependency and that encroachment was inevitable. They thought they were simply bartering as they did with other tribes, when in fact the situation was far more complex. Theydid not understand the implications of the cultural and technological differences. The European Americans were a progressive race, the North Amerian Natives were not.<br /><br />(4) The noble savage is a myth. No race is more noble than any other. Nobility itself is an undelineated and therefore obscure moral concept. Moreover, its clearer application is to individuals, not groups.<br /><br />(5) The past is gone. None of us can recover what has been lost through the onward force of technology. The cultures of the American Indians were overrun by this force, just as we ourselves are overrun and changed, often without being aware of it. I believe that there will be revolts against this force of technology. The various pre-technological lifestyles of the American Indian up through the 19th century will be studied far in the future by people intrigued with primitive living.<br /><br />(6) What happened to the American Indians was a tragedy and tragically unavoidable. Any American who values freedom and hates tyranny, invasion, or oppression should understand why these people fought to keep their lifestyle, their culture, and their homelands.<br /><br />(7) No one now living is responsible for what happened in the past. Causality doesn't work that way. Our ancestors made their choices. We make our own.<br /><br />Dee Brown does not present any of these points, or anything like them. He wrote the book under a simple formula: Red Man Good, White Man Bad. It's as if the Indians' cry of \\"they started it\\" justifies everything the tribes, their warriors, and their people did. The book is written from a childlike moral judgment. Even the language is simplified, as if the book were written for young, immature minds. Not only is the book strongly biased and therefore historically innacurrate, one could argue that it is racist.<br /><br />In case you're only skimming this review and missed an earlier remark, I'll repeat that I understand and identify with the American Indians' fight for their homelands. I also think they were doomed to subjugation as soon as Europeans discovered the continent. It just took a while for it to happen across the country. The Indians were compelled to fight against the encroachment of the Whites upon their lands, and the Whites were compelled by the onward force of their culture (which unlike the Indian cultures was progressive) to encroach upon those lands. The encroachment, although nobody thought of it that way in the beginning, began with trade. The Indians came to depend upon the trading posts. They became dependent upon the Whites for firearms and ammunition, which they had come to believe they needed in order to hunt and therefore to eat and survive.<br /><br />The Indians who tried to live in peace with the Whites misunderstood the nature of white culture and therefore white encroachment. They thought they could retain their static culture while white culture continued to move onward and change. Those tribes who raised persistent war against the Whites understood that attempts at cooperation led to subjugation. The only way the North American Natives could have retained their cultures in whatever ways those cultures might have naturally developed is if the Europeans had never found the continent. That is an impossibility.<br /><br />What I fault Brown with, in saying the book is arguably racist, is that he writes rhetorically and gives an expurgated history of the Indians' actions in this fight for their homelands. He literally *does not mention* what they did when they attacked and killed white men, women and children; but the abuse and killing of Indians by Whites is given clear language. He's like a lawyer, skewing the presentation of facts to make his client look his best. This was a war of cultures and the cultures were separated by race. In that sense, it was a racial war. But fundamentally, and I believe this adamantly, it was a war of cultures, with one culture destined by the nature of its dynamics and force to win. Brown, in choosing sides (and so ignoring the ethnological complexity of the subject), sides with the Indian cultures and hence with a race, and ends up writing a skewed account that reads like a racist book.<br /><br />Brown excludes any discussion of warfare among the tribes themselves and so gives the impression that the only bloody battles the Indians fought were against encroaching Whites. This also results in his leaving out any discussion of the Indians' views on the rules of war. Edwin Thompson Denig, in his 1856 book Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri, writes about intertribal warfare. In one 1835 incident, in which 40 or 50 horses were stolen from the Sioux by some Pawnees and Arickaras, the thieves were pursued and 22 of them killed. The Sioux warriors returned with the stolen horses and brought with them \\"the head, hands, feet and other parts of the enemies' bodies into camp. The hands and feet were stuck on sticks and paraded through the village by old women. The scalpless heads were dragged about with cords attached, followed by small boys shooting them with arrows, with guns loaded with powder, pounding them with rocks and tomahawks, encouraged by old hags who followed heaping abuse on the helpless and now haggard remains of their once feared enemies.\\" (Denig: 18)<br /><br />In another incident of the 1830s related by Denig, the Assiniboines along with some Cree attacked a Blackfeet village. All but 8 or 10 Blackfeet men were out hunting when the attack occurred. \\"The few men in camp defended themselves bravely, but all were killed, also every woman and child found there, who numbered about 130 souls. This was a terrible massacre. The children were killed and tormented to death in every possible variety of savage warfare. Many were roasted alive by a pointed stick being run through the body and planting it in the ground before a hot fire. No prisoners were taken, no mercy shown. But one or two boys escaped to bring the dreadful intelligence to the ears of their people.\\" (Denig: 77) This was Indian against Indian. In the Sand Creek massacre of 1864, as told by Brown in chapter four of his book, 105 women and children, and 28 men died. (Brown: 91) Both were vicious and brutal attacks, and during both attacks almost all the men of the village were away hunting; but Brown never admits to the manner and brutality of the Indians' own methods of war. He wants us to focus on White brutality against the Indian and to think the Indian incapable of such horrors. This is false, and Dee Brown knew it.<br /><br />His chapter three account of the 1862 Dakota war in Minnesota excludes any detail of the atrocities of the Indians against white settlers and homesteaders and focuses on the complaints of the Santee Sioux. For the bloody details that Brown ignores see Duane Schultz' 1992 Over the Earth I Come. Schultz also wrote a book in 1990 on the Sand Creek Massacre called Month of the Freezing Moon. I've read the 1992 book (and reviewed it) but haven't seen the 1990 book.<br /><br />Brown compounds his falsehoods when he writes about the 1866 Fetterman massacre in chapter six. He mentions mutilations by the Indians that were so upsetting they provoked Colonel Carrington to write an essay upon the subject. Mutilations included \\"disembowelings, hacked limbs\\" and, wrote Carrington, \\"private parts severed and indecently placed upon the person.\\" (137) As I read this I was surprised Brown was mentioning it, then his disingenous, twisted purpose became clear. \\"The Indians who ambushed Fetterman were only imitating their enemies, a practice which in warfare, as in civilian life, is said to be the sincerest form of flattery.\\" (137) Again, if you're only skimming this review, back up a few paragraphs and read the two quotations from Edwin Denig's book Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri.<br /><br />Brown repeats his exculpation of Indian mutilation of Whites when he writes in chapter nine of Cochise \\"mutilating [his three white male prisoners] with lances, a cruel practice the Apaches had learned from the Spaniards.\\" (194) The Spaniards also, according to the Navahos, Brown tells us, introduced scalping; and even if Europeans didn't actually introduce it, declares Brown, they \\"made the custom popular by offering bounties for scalps of their respective enemies.\\" (25) In Brown's version of history, the Indians are never to blame. Whatever cruelty they have was taught them by others outside their race.<br /><br />\\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" was a brilliant choice for a title, and it helped make the book known by far more people than have ever read it. Brown's narrative style is simple and clear, putting the reader in the primitive mindset of the 19th century Indian. This makes the book easy to read, although the linguistic and intellectual simplicity is tiring. The political and moral simplicity is doubtless appealing to those inclined to simple judgments. It may be pertinent that the book was written during the Vietnam war, militant racial unrest, the civil rights movement, the \\"back to nature\\" movement, the ecology movement, the \\"new age\\" movement, anti-military sentiment, social protest, and widespread disrespect for those in authority. To \\"drop out\\" of society was to reject the dominant, regimented, technological culture and establish a \\"counter-culture\\" that sought a return to the primitive.<br /><br />At the end of chapter twelve, The War for the Black Hills, on page 313, Brown tells us that after the killing of Crazy Horse while he was in custody, his father and mother buried his bones and heart \\"somewhere near Chankpe Opi Wakpala, the creek called Wounded Knee.\\"<br /><br />I give this book low marks, but I think you should read it anyway. It is affective (I intend this word) and influential.<br /><br />\\"Let me be a free man -- free to travel, free to stop, free to work, free to trade where I choose, free to choose my own teachers, free to follow the religion of my fathers, free to think and talk and act for myself -- and I will obey every law, or submit to the penalty.\\" - Chief Joseph (330)<br /><br />It was a grievous age.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I've read a number of reviews here.  Come on people, the Kindle Fire was just released.  All accessories will be expensive.  As far as quality goes, I am very impressed.  The case fits perfectly around the Fire and all ports and speakers are UNobstructed.  I am VERY confident that if I dropped this thing the case would do its job very well.  I'm happy and will most definitely keep this product.
B000002MTR|4.0|This album is very cool as many others by Red Hot. I believe that this album with Freaky and Californication are their best. I know that mosat people foind Blood sugar as their best album but i think is to commercial and i like a little more funky cool mystigue songs. Anyway this is a must album for any fan who likes cool music and especially Red hot. In somew parts they reminds me a little more cooler and happier Pearl Jam.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|So there are allot of people talking trash about Take Care saying it's too R&B. Well I agree. This bulk of the album is R&B but this is what Drake does. If you want a rap album get one from a rapper. Drake is a special kind of artist he has the ability to rap and sing so thats what he gives you. I think the album is Classic!
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Suffice to say, that if you are a fan of Lady A, and you don't already own this album, then you're missing out!  My personal favorites are 'We Owned the Night' and 'Friday Night' - which I think would be another big hit for them if it gets released as a single.  I love Hilary's vocals on 'As You Turn Away'.  This is one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through, and not feel like you've wasted your time.  If you're a fan, you owe it to yourself to buy the album and enjoy the whole thing!
B002NXSRVG|1.0|When previews first started airing for this movie, I immediately did not want to see it.  I'd already seen the first Transformers movie and rather enjoyed it, but there was something about the G.I. Joe movie that just didn't sit right with me.  Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that a lot of the action scenes looked as if they'd been copied from Transformers, or perhaps it had something to do with all the horribly cheesy acting that that reeked like month-old limburger.  Either way, against my better judgement, I watched the film on Netflix, and I really wish I hadn't.<br /><br />If you were like me and absolutely loved the old G.I. Joe cartoon when you were a kid, do me a favor and avoid watching this movie at all costs.  Even if you can watch it for free, the cost is too high, and there's no way to get that time back.  It's hard to pinpoint what's so awful about this movie because...well, pretty much EVERYTHING about this movie is awful.  The plot, the acting, the action, the dialogue, it's all terrible.
0385534639|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've read all year.<br /><br />Magical, mysterious, and creative, this is Erin Morgenstern's first book -- and I can't WAIT for anything else she writes.<br /><br />The premise -- circus tents show up with no previous announcement.  They can appear anywhere in the word.  Rather than the colorful tents of the circus we know as kids, these circus tents are striped in black and white.  Tent after tent follows a winding path through the circus, and where you may have seen one thing one day, you might find something else later.<br /><br />Oh -- and the circus is only open at night.<br /><br />The characters are richly developed, but the main characters, Celia and Marco, are pitted against each other in a competition whose outcome is nebulous and until the end, not really known.  At first, the two have no idea who their opponent is, but as it begins to dawn on them, they also realize they're falling in love.<br /><br />So many magical things happen in this book -- it's emotional, exciting, mesmerizing, and suspenseful.  The ending will leave you spellbound.<br /><br />Read this book!
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this album! It is a little jazzy and a little retro. The simple background music really highlights Zooey's amazing voice. I hear a hint of Patsy Cline once in awhile... Soooo cool!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Everyone seems to be ripping this product because it's not worth $40.  Yes, the case itself is definitely not worth $40.  But, it works, the stand works and it's functional.  Had I spent some time to look around I could definitely have found one cheaper of equal quality.
0321704452|4.0|When I first picked up this book I thought; Oh great Garr Reynolds is a progressive nut who is going to try and convince me that the combination of presenting naked and lessons from Asian culture will make me a better presenter\\".  He was most likely going to tell me that being naked would give me some kind of inner peace allowing me to talk freely and without fear.  I quickly found out that I was right.<br />Ok, so presenting naked was figurative and not literal.  The author was quick to explain that the way you give a presentation is to present it for the audience not the speaker.  I never really thought of it in those terms.  I have always prepared my presentations by looking at what I would want.  This really opened my eyes to what has been wrong with every boring presentation that I have ever sat through.  The presenter never cared or bothered to ask what the audience wanted.<br />There were some good key points in each chapter that I felt would help me with my next presentation.  In Chapter two Garr told us that we need to fully prepare before taking the podium.  I know that when I give a presentation this is the one area that I spend most of my time.  I often spend too much time preparing and end up over thinking the presentation.  The end result is information overload.  Garr walks us through a very nice eight step process for preparing a presentation.  I found this process extremely useful in preparing for my presentation.  The 8 step process should be in a pop up window whenever you open power point.  Now that I have put some thought into whom I'm giving the presentation to and I'm properly prepared, what about the actual presentation?  What can I do to become a more effective presenter?  I pulled a few things from the next couple of chapters that I thought would help me to drive home my presentation.  Chapter Three Garr says \\"Connect with Punch, Presence, and Projection\\".  The story he told about the news anchor made me realize that he was right.  You should reach out and grab the audience's attention right away.  I want to open my presentation like the evening news.  In the next chapter he told us to engage with Passion.  I have seen a few presentations where a passionate and engaging speaker was able to capture the audience's attention even though the topic was boring.  I'm speaking on a topic that I am very passionate about and my challenge will be to ensure that the audience sees that passion.  I believe that my passion for the subject will allow me to connect with presence and projection.  Projecting my passion to the audience is not the only area that I will have difficulty with.  Garr touched on a big problem in chapter five.  Looking at it from the audience's point of view I can see that I tend to be very monotone and even though I have passion for the topic I may be putting everyone to sleep.  I might use note cards with single words on them like VOLUME, PITCH, and RATE.  I have to say my favorite part of the book was chapter six.  This was just a well written chapter.  Garr tells us to \\"End with a Powerful Finish\\".  In every presentation I give from now on I will have this image in my head of a cinnamon roll with the words \\"MAKE YOUR ENDING STICKY\\".  You don't need to say anything after that.  The image says it all for you.<br />This was a decent book with a lot of good tips and lessons on the art of the presentation.  I still think that Garr Reynolds is a progressive nut.  I'm an American and my culture and that voice in my head tells me that I'm not getting into a bath naked with a bunch of people that I work with.  He did teach me a few things and changed the way I will approach my future presentations.  I am looking forward to giving my first \\"naked\\" presentation.each out and grab the audience's attention right away.  I want to open my presentation like the evening news.

1451627289|4.0|Steve Still Rocks<br /><br />He's our Dickens, a man who had, and still has, the most fecund imagination of any of our popular novelists. Yes, the novel is long and windy. Like most of his recent work, I start skimming around page 450 or so, and then slow down to read the last 100-150 page carefully. Yes, he betrays his liberal political bias, which is always a little irksome to a John Bircher like myself, but the good news is that he tempers his bias in this one with some very likeable Christians, and small-towners from rural Texas. Heck, the main character even attends church. And there's a vast improvement in his language. The instances of the f-word are relatively far and few between. What we get with 11/22/63 is a strong character driven later-life masterpiece which I've spent the last 3-4 days read/skimmming.<br /><br />Last spring I took my family to Cocoa Beach Florida to watch the next to the last Space Shuttle launch. They canceled it. Instead we hung out on the beach. There I met a man who claimed to have gone to grammar school with King. The weird thing about it is that he had the same weird physiognomy that King has; the head shaped like it had been caught in a vise, the slightly crazed eyes, the crooked teeth, the New England accent. He told me King as a kid used to get in trouble in class and instead of riding it out in detention, was allowed by the teacher to write stories which he would then read aloud to the class.<br /><br />I loved most of this book. More so than anything else he has done in the last decade. There's still a lot of life left in his his slightly twisted psyche, there's still a lot of fertility in that mind. Here's hoping that the pain from his near-death accident in '99 subsides, and he finds enough peace to finally sleep at night with the light on.
1585104205|4.0|This is the color version of the basic Latin text used for years by many students, especially at smaller city, community, and state colleges. The book is printed on good quality paper, and is completely in Latin. It's essentially the story of a Roman family; think of it as Dick and Jane (Dickus et Janis).
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Very flimsy.  Cheap plastic shell attached to a flimsy flap that I question will be able to protect the glass front at all.  Don't waste your money with this.  ***UPDATE****  Have to update my one star review to a three star, as I've been using the cover for over two weeks now.  While marketing this as a stand is laughable, it always falls down when using the touch interface. (Note to cover designers, bear in mind the degree of push one has to exert when designing a stand for a TOUCH based device.)  I have to admit the simplicity and protection the cover provides has been impressive. Which brings me to the reason I'm updating my review.  When exiting a city bus one of the doors of the bus pinned my backpack (Fire inside) against the side of the stairwell. I was pretty horrified when it happened. Thinking here I bought a Fire, had it less than 5 days and then this happens. Thankfully the Fire survived intact. Minor scrapes on the leather cover. But, the case did a great job at protecting my Fire.  So I'm amending this review to three starts. I think the light weight industrial design is simple and effective. As far as the flexibility of use, aka being a stand. I remain unconvinced.
B005DOKK7Q|1.0|I have ordered so many items from Amazon and have always been so pleased.  This cover is the exception.  It has an awful odor which does not seem to fade.  I have returned it and ordered something different....the return process was very user friendly and I thank Amazon for that.
B000J5XS3C|3.0|Pros: The mixer is solidly built with knobs and buttons that work the way you'd expect them too. The pre-amps are a bit noisy at high gain levels, and the 3 band EQ is exactly what you'd expect, but no more. The console itself is a good buy. The AC Adapter, however...  Cons: Recapping what others have said, the AC Adapter is not a standard adapter. This might not seem like a big deal, except that if it breaks, like mine did, you can't swap the adapter from another product, or buy a universal one. I have had this mixer less than two months, used it for one show and for a few practice sessions , after which it has been carefully packed away in a plastic box with a bunch of other equipment. My adapter came COMPLETELY apart (see the photo). I contacted Behringer about the issue, and have never heard back from them.  So...this is a decent mixer for the price. The Xynyx preamp is okay if you don't turn it up too loud, and the construction of the console is great, however the shoddy and difficult to replace AC Adapter, and slow if non-existent customer service will cause me to look elsewhere to find a replacement. You should skip the step of buying this unit in the first place.
B003YHCZD6|4.0|The point of view for this novel caught me by surprise. Like most teen love stories, I expected A Walk to Remember to be a girls account of her first love and getting swiped off her feet. I enjoyed the male insight. I feel Sparks was very accurate in describing Landon's feelings as a teenager. For example, how his reputations clouded his real feelings for Jaime. Sparks did well in capturing Landon's changing emotions and the pain he went through from falling in love with a wonderful girl dying from leukemia.   I was interested in reading this book because I have heard great reviews about Nicholas Sparks and knew this novel was made into a movie that many of my friends teared up watching, but I had never heard much about the plot. At first I did find it predictable and uninteresting because it seemed like any other story about shallow teen boys. However, I continued to read and once Landon's affection showed through and the problem of Jaime's leukemia raised, I was hooked.   Sparks writes in a way teenagers can understand and connect with, at the same time he describes mature situations with very serious decisions to be made. Sparks opens the readers heart to Jaime's unique giving personality and shows that it is possible for people to only want others to be happy. Jaime's influence on Landon is heart warming and she manages to turn a selfish teenager into a caring matures man. The way Landon's pain upon finding out Jaime's secret is expressed makes the reader feel like you are in his shoes and Sparks had me thinking about the pain I would feel losing a loved one. This love story is really moving and is for those looking for a story that takes you through the difficulties of true love.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have never left a review on a book before even though I have been going through a book every few days since I got my Kindle.  This made the cut for my first review.  I LOVED it.  Kept me interested from beginning to end and I even caught my heart beating faster in the end as things were unfolding. I like to be surprised with a little twist and I got it.  I'm very pleased and will be purchasing the final book asap.
030788743X|5.0|To say I liked this book is an understatement.  Its cliché, but I could not put it down.  I don't normally write reviews, but this book definitely is an exception.  Cline really got you sucked in, almost each chapter was a cliff hanger.  It gets really geeky at some points, but stays approachable to any reader.  This is one of the best books I've read in a while.  As far as story goes, it's up there with \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\".  Cline isn't quite as talented in his prose as Adams, but that fact doesn't hurt the characters or story in any way.
B005P39GOI|5.0|Amazing album.. not a bad track on it!!.. Music is great for driving, or just relaxing to with a nice bottle of wine.. Now just release it in the US!!

B005HSG3TC|3.0|Like a lot of other reviewers here I'm just a little disappointed with this once I actually got it in my hands. I do like the way the kindle snaps in place. It feels secure once in. My issue is mostly with the front cover (as opposed to the back where the kindle snaps in. When I flip it open to use the device I'm finding that the cover is twisting at the hinge. The Fire is heavier than I expected and I'm holding it with at least my pinkie at the bottom. BUT, the power button is down there too, so to keep from accidentally turning off the device I end up with the lower edge of the cover resting on my pinkie finger. Then it gets all twisty. When I tuck the cover into the elastic strap it definitely twists less. I'm sure I'm being picky, but it was $40. It just feels like a $20 cover.<br /><br />********* UPDATE ***********<br />After using this for 7 months I've actually become fond of this cover. I use my kindle at least an hour a day and the case is holding up very well. The find myself hooking my hand inside the elastic strap to hold ut up if I'm reading in bed or watching a movie. I'm sure it wasn't made for that kind of stress but it's securely in place. The case has done a good job of protecting my Kindle too. In addition to the durability of the case the price was dropped shortly after the Kindle Fire was released that the more reasonable twenty or twenty-five bucks now seems like an perfectly appropriate price.
B0062W3GRY|5.0|There have only been one or two shows in my life that I have waited impatiently for the next episode.  This is one of them.  I was worried at first thinking they would try to shock us with sex and nudity and not horror.  It just ruins the \\"edge of the seat\\" feeling when you see some man's naked rear walking downstairs.  But they have done a great job with the show.  It's an emotional roller coaster, and the acting and directing are perfect.  If you like the genre, you should enjoy the show.
1594744769|5.0|Sixteen-year-old Jacob Portman used to believe all the amazing stories his grandfather told him. Tales of an island in Wales and a strange group of children who lived in a home run by Miss Peregrine. Jacob's own grandfather was sent to the home to be kept safe during the war. Jacob knows the stories can't be real and now that he's a teen, he's much too old for his grandfather's peculiar stories. But when his grandfather is killed, Jacob witnesses the unimaginable. For him, the only possible way to explain what he's seen is to travel to Wales and see Miss Peregrine's for himself.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book! Riggs's chosen images work incredibly well integrated into the story. The characters are wonderful and the story is wholly original -- quite unlike anything I've ever come across to be totally honest. MISS PEREGRINE'S is one of my favorite books of the year and one I highly recommend for teens and adults.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Amazing interface, works perfect for what it does. Could have more features but i believe those are being saved for wunderkit.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It's hard to be critical of a Bible app.  Especially when it's free.  The only problem I have is that I try to use it when I go to church so I don't have to carry a big Bible with me.  The church I go to is inside a concrete building that has a terrible 3g signal inside and sometimes by the time the scripture finally comes up, the reading is already finished.  Works perfectly with WiFi, or when you have a good 3g or 4g signal though.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|\\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" will always have a special place in my heart, as the book that gave me courage to move away from religious fundamentalism, and accept scientific fact.  This book is a thorough explanation of the evidence for the theory of evolution, ranging from an analysis of the fossil record to breeding experiments with plants and domesticated animals.  It is aimed mainly at those readers who have misunderstandings regarding the theory, particularly those who have studied it only through creationist materials.  As someone coming from such a background, I found that Richard Dawkins does an excellent job of dismantling these misunderstandings and providing proper information in their stead.  The book is not an attack on religion, so any religious folk wanting to get a better understanding of science need not be afraid in that regard.  Dawkins even states early on in the book that his purpose with this work is to shed light on the misunderstandings that surround this amazing theory.  While I personally found the information useful in shaping a non-religious worldview, others may simply find it useful in allowing them to interpret religious writings in a more educated, scientific fashion.  Perhaps just as important as the accuracy of the information, \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" is an intriguing and entertaining read.  Dawkins spices up what could have been a boring transfer of information with dry but scintillating humor, and his love of life is infectious, as he describes the beauty inherent in a theory which relates us to every living thing on our planet.
B003B96AOW|5.0|Simply an Amazing sculpture of THE DEADPOOL He ROCKS!!! The only thing that I have seen others having problems with is the ball joint at the top of the leg everyone says that it is very stiff and won't turn but I have found that if you are VERY CAREFUL you can get it to turn quite nicely. What I did is I took a dry wash clothe put it around the joint then took a pair of needle nose pliers and gripped the clothe so as to not gouge or scratch the figure and gently but firmly started to turn the leg while holding the joint with the pliers, and it loosened up nicely. May not work on all but that is what I did to get it to work and it seams to turn and bend very nice now. Good Luck and you can't go wrong with quality and awesomeness of this figure.

044654759X|4.0|I just finished this book last night and like many of the other people that wrote reviews...I couldn't put it down.

B004AYCWZI|1.0|he'll apparently given anything you put in front of him a positive review.  First it was the glowing review for \\"Bones, Blood and Butter\\" and now calling \\"The Hundred-Foot Journey\\" \\"easily the best novel set in the word of cooking\\".  Seriously?  I found it thinly developed and fully of hackneyed stereotypes (the bitter old woman with the heart of gold, the hard driving playboy chef, etc).  Michelin stars are tossed about casually.  The protagonist becomes unrecognizable.  I love reading about cooking, kitchens and the world of fine dining.  This unfortunately left me cold, and I slogged through it.

B004HW7JMO|3.0|Spartacus Gods of the Arena was chalk full of blood, gore, violence, manipulations, political scheming, and sex, forced, consentual, politically motivated, etc.  Gods of the Arena had it all.  The graphics were not top notch, but they weren't bad for a cable series.  They still had me cringing.      I did watch some of the first season Spartacus Blood & Sand and Gods of the Arena further explores the lives of Lucretia and Batiatus.  I walked away from Gods of the Arena with a smidgen of like (not much more) for them.  I couldn't stand them in the first season - bad, bad, bad.  Yes, it wasn't all pink sparklies back then but that doesn't mean I have to like the bad guys.  LOL!  If you are a fan of the first season then you probably won't want to miss this one either as it will give you more insight into the characters.  I did miss Andy Whitfield in the role of Spartacus though, yet I am looking forward to seeing how Liam McIntyre fills his shoes.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|We have owned the DVD version of this miniseries for several years now and have always loved the adaptation for not only how true it is to the novel, but also for the superb acting.  When we realized that it was now out on Blu-ray it was an instant purchase.  The high quality rescan is GORGEOUS!  It looks like a brand new film, almost as if it were recorded digitally in the past few years rather than on film!  It is not longer \\"dated\\" to anything other than the time of the novel.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|One reviewer called IMMORTALS, \\"an orgy of severed heads,\\" and that's pretty much the basis for the film, though I only counted a dozen or so heads flying about by the movie's end. IMMORTALS tells the story of Theseus, slayer of the Minotaur, but bears little resemblence to any Greek myth. Granted Theseus did slay the Minotaur, but in IMMORTALS, the Minotaur is a man wearing the shroud of a bull in service to Hyperion--whom Theseus never encountered--and the plot is the war of the Titans versus the Olympian gods--a war the Theseus of myth was absent from. The interpretation of myth didn't bother me much, but it did leave for a confusing mesh of Greek stories.<br /><br />The biggest error of the film was in the massive, gaping, bleeding plot holes. One: When you are the Evil Overlord Hyperion and you have captured the Virgin Oracle that you require to find your Bow of Epicness, you should be smart enough to leave some guards around the holding cell. Two: When sending your armies into a tunnel to die in the bottleneck, you might instead consider sending them up the nearby stairs, you know, the ones Hyperion took uncontested to the top of the wall where he could let loose the Titans, guard-free. Three: When you shout a warning, \\"It's a trap,\\" don't proceed to follow the trap-ee into his demise. Four: I really want to know where the Virgin Oracle was carrying around poison antidotes; all I can figure is she must have magical Virgin Oracle Sex Powers. Just sayin'.<br /><br />Redeeming the film was the acting of Mickey Rourke as King Hyperion. The man pulled off creepy, sadistic, psycho-king-on-a-mission with style... despite the funny hats he was forced to endure. I mean, who puts a lobster claw on their head?<br /><br />Another good point: muscled, oiled, man-cakes. Hundreds of them. Enough said.<br /><br />The film aims at a deeper meaning, the granting of immortality through deeds, hence the title. However, IMMORTALS is mostly a spectacle for the eye, combining silly god-hats and bloody slaughter in CGI'ed glory without a lot of depth. I found myself enjoying the film, if only for the headless montage and the giggles it induced. Recommended only as a rental, and only if you want some good, mindless bloodshed. If your looking for emotions or story or thought, look elsewhere.glory without a lot of depth. I found myself enjoying the film, if only for the headless montage and the giggles it induced.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|\\"At age 3, Caesar has completed puzzles ages 8 and up. He has been displaying cognitive skills that far exceed that of a human counterpart.\\"  Will (Franco) has been working on a cure for alzheimers.  He tests his experiments on apes, and thinks that he has finally found what he is looking for.  When one dies during the test he is left to take care of her baby.  When he takes the little ape home he begins to notice things that aren't normal.  This is another movie that exploded in the theaters and I waited to see it till just the other day.  What I have noticed lately is that the longer you wait to see a movie this popular it never lives up to what you expect.  When everyone says how good the movie is and it's the best movie they have seen your expectations are too high and it always disappoints.  This is the exception.  This is truely a great movie that is an absolute must see.  I did not like the Marky-Mark \\"Planet Of The Apes\\" but this one is nothing like that one.  This one actually has a story that keeps you interested and you are hooked in from the beginning.  The most amazing part of this movie is that there are large chunks of the movie where there is no dialog at all and until someone says something you don't really notice.  This movie sucks you in and keeps hold of you until the ending.  A must see.  Overall, one of the few movies that can actually live up to the hype it has gotten.  I easily give it an A.<br /><br />*Also try - Planet Of The Apes
B000002GW5|1.0|Agree this has not aged well at all -- &#34;Cocaine&#34; is the absolute low point of his recording career -- HORRIBLE song.  Just what I want to hear is a bunch of morons snorting up and singing out of tune -- now that's talent.  Rest of the album is ok with a couple of great tunes -- Running on Empty, You Love the Thunder and The Load Out/Stay.  However David Lindley totally ruins these songs with that horrible lap steel guitar.  Sounds like fingernails on a chalk board!!!  Try &#34;The Pretender&#34;, &#34;Late For the Sky&#34;, &#34;Hold Out&#34; or even &#34;Lawyers in Love&#34; before this one.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|The first time I came in contact with Adele's music was when I watched the \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" music video on MTV. Up until that time, my concept for Adele (rather inaccurate, I confess) had already been established: she was probably just another flat-out boring pop star...I mean, when was the last time the #1 spot on Billboard had been hit by an actually GOOD ARTIST? (that's just my opinion...hahaha). But when my ears \\"layed eyes\\" on the song, I stopped and put down my remote. There was something about that \\"we could have had it aaaaaaaallllllllllll\\" that gave me goose-bumps...and that voice...heavenly :) That same day, I opened up the youtube video and just kept playing it for the rest of the day. I can safely say that Adele is now a favorite of mine and I'm so glad I have this record.  As for the album itself, \\"Rumour Has It\\" (awsome sassy vocals and instrumental arrangements...love the piano interlude), \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" (if the chorus doesn't set it, I don't know what will!!), \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" (really contagious beat, which someone played her heart to) and \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" (the most cheerful song on the record) are my absolute favorites. There is nothing wrong with the second-single \\"Someone Like You\\"(which by the way, has a beautiful chorus), but it just doesn't stand out like the others I listed. The ony set-back I can think of is that the CD doesn't come with the lyrics...but you know, some artists like to leave the interprtations of their songs to the listener and that's fine ;)  She has come a long way since her 2008 debut and I'm anxious for her next release (and I've only listened to the album twice!!).

B0055OK2T0|5.0|I feel like I'm doing yoga to this movie its contouring every other minute I can't trust the story line. It all feels so fake or maybe its just the f'n music I cannot take the characters seriously to music that reminds me of a bad sitcom. The director could of made the  movie into something much greater despite the retarded music because the basic story would allow for it to be very interesting, and maybe even fun to portray, but he shot this as if they just handed some guy a handy-cam and let the main actor lose on the streets of New York only stopping to feed him every 12 hours...but I liked it in the end, Hollywood reserves a spot in my heart, just how the mc rib has a spot reserved in my ass.
B005I6EU48|2.0|Like the other two and three star reviewers have already mentioned, this cover may claim it's for the Kindle Fire but it's most definitely not.  In fact, the cardboard insert does not even mention the Fire among the readers it accommodates.  I found that the Fire had to be forced into the four cornor elastic straps with too much effort.  The unit is too solid to be damaged but how long can the straps retain their elasticity under that much stress? I could live with that but the fact that the cover does not lay flat is the deal breaker.  The Fire is too thick and I do not see the cover's spine relaxing enough over time for the cover to shut flat against the screen.  Yes, the faux-leather cover looks nice but not nice enough.  This is already packed and ready to ship back for a refund (along with the Kindle Fire itself, but that's another story.)

B005WFUZTE|5.0|I've been a fan of Megadeth's music since 2005. The first album that I listened to was TSHF and I was so impressed by that album that I checked out the entire catalog of Megadeth. And I've never stopped following their music ever since. After TSHF came UA. While it definitely had its share of great moments, examples of which include tracks 1,2,6, and 11, I felt somehow disappointed by that album. The songs, IMHO, were a little too forced and did not feel great to my ears structurally, and the whole album lacked consistency in general. Following UA came Endgame which was a very pleasant surprise, and I believe it will remain as one of the standouts in Megadeth's career. the songs were brutal and the solos were among the bests that I've ever heard in any Megadeth album. However, I think that there was some kind of a gap between the point that the album started and the point that it ended. If one listens to the first and the last four songs of that album and compares them musically, one can easily notice that they are not on par with each other. This brings me to the Megadeth's latest effort TH1RT3EN. I have to admit that I was not very impressed by this album when I first listened to it, but as I gave it a second and a third shot, I could not stop listening to it. Now, I love it even more than Endgame. I realize that the songs on this album are sooooo catchy and their catchiness would most definitely become noticeable after a couple of listens. In a nutshell, This is the most consistent Megadeth album since TSHF. A must buy for any metal fan!  PS:  For those fans who live in Middle-Eastern countries, Such as myself being an Iranian, and who do not have access to credit cards and stuff, you can try Amazon gift cards. It's a great way for legally downloading your favorite music and supporting your favorite bands. Cheers! :)

0316017930|5.0|The book discharges the idea of genius or outstanding person by uniquely their upper intelligence condition or at least born to be an hero. The author reveals, toward explanatory and historical theory, that external conditions like; culture, age of birth, family economical and intellectual conditions, and mainly dedication make the difference. He wraps them all and we might call them \\"luck\\", this last recognized by his study, as being the responsible by the individual performance. The arguments are strong based on historical evidences and by his personal live. In my oppinion the book brings interesting reflexions and the message brought make all sense.

B000BJ7BCK|4.0|Sky High (2005) is a fun film that explores a world where superheroes and superpowers are a part of everyday life, and the children of superheroes attend a special high school suspended high above the Earth.  As teens enter adolescence and their super powers begin to emerge, Sky High's mission is to train and prepare them for their future lives.<br /><br />Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) the son of two of famous superheroes, is about to enter Sky High.  His father Steve Stronghold (Kurt Russell) is The Commander, a being with super strength.  His mother Josie (Kelly Preston) is known as Jetstream, and can fly at supersonic speeds.  Will's best friend Layla Williams (Danielle Panabaker) has a crush on him.  Will, Layla, and their friends Ethan (Dee Jay Daniels), Zach (Nicholas Braun), and Magenta (Kelly Vitz), are all freshmen at Sky High, and get there via a special flying school bus, driven by Ron Wilson (Kevin Heffernan).  After being greeted by Principal Powers (Lynda Carter, Wonder Woman), the freshman face their first big test, as Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) evaluates each kid's budding superpowers, and decides whether they are hero material, or more suited to be sidekick providing hero support.<br /><br />Will and his friends are assigned to the hero support class, taught by All-American Boy (Dave Foley).  Will's powers suddenly emerge when he gets into a wild battle in the cafeteria with Warren Peace (Steven Strait), the son of a criminal who was put in prison by his father.  Transferred to the hero group, Will finds himself partnered with senior Gwen Grayson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who is class president, a technopath, smoking hot, and wants to go to homecoming with him.<br /><br />Solid entertainment for the whole family, Sky High explores life in a most unusual high school, and nicely develops the evolving relationships between Will, Gwen, Warren, and Layla.  The appearance of his powers brings many changes for the dorky Will, and not all of them are positive.  Threads soon come together, as an evil plot that threatens Sky High comes to light.  This sets the stage for a tremendous battle at homecoming, where it takes the combined superpowers of all the young teens, to defeat an unexpected and deadly threat.  The special effects which are solid throughout, rocket to a new heights in the finale.<br /><br />Will is a goofball, makes lots of mistakes, and isn't exactly ideal hero material, but he does the right thing, and steps up when it counts.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead seems too mature to play a high school student, but the beautiful and athletic actress is such a joy to watch.  Dressed mostly in a rubber suit, Kurt Russell is also very entertaining, seeming to revel in overplaying his role.  The film's soundtrack, made up of 80's pop tunes, is an interesting oddity.on come together, as an evil plot that threatens Sky High comes to light.

1439110123|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. Read that last sentence again.  Daniel Yergin explains, in a very familiar voice, the history of all things petroleum and the influence it has had on our world and social interactions. This IS NOT a dry history book in the least--it is packed with anecdotes of important, influential, strange and intelligent people.  Understanding the global economy and especially the energy industry is paramount in our times (in my belief). This is a great primer for the relations and tensions between almost every social group in the world and has remained (and probably will remain) relevant since its publication.  As a petroleum engineer, I recommend this book for those who have a background in science or engineering and even those who don't are likely to appreciate the way Yergin breaks down even the scientific jargon (just the way he breaks down the history for number-types like me).  5 stars--the only thing I could ask for is updates in the coming years as the energy industry continues to emerge in prominence in our daily lives :)

030788743X|5.0|I waded into Ready Player One with the expectation that it would be another predictable, but hopefully imaginative reveal of how humans will collaborate and learn together in massively multi-player synthetic environments. I was very surprised to find it to be much more.   I was not prepared for the waves of nostalgia that swept over me as Ernest Cline began revealing and reliving the entire 1980s popular cultural history. The hero and heroine of the novel are playing a high stakes game where their 1980s cultural literacy reveals the keys to unlock a mighty fortune with which they hope to reverse mankind's dwindling fortunes if they succeed. The story itself could have done with more dramatic situations, but that small shortcoming is more than made up for by the rich tapestry of 1980s movie, video game and TV sitcom culture and subculture woven so skillfully and fetishistically into the story.   I found myself thinking that this book belongs in the cornerstone time vaults of buildings and space probes so that those who come after us or who encounter us in the great beyond will have an accurate picture of 1980s America preserved forever.   I would throw Delillo's Underworld in there too, for good measure.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|For those Megadeth completists out there, the original studio version of \\"New World Order\\" was actually recorded by (criminally underrated!!) Chicago metal band, Zoetrope, on its Mind Over Splatter record.  It is an awesome version and well worth checking out.

I have pieced together bootlegs over the years, but nothing compares to this release. I get tired of the speculation of is this really it? Yes. This is as good as you can get. If you could go back to 1966/67, then you would still not be able to hear it. I am glad they released it. It is much better than the 2004 version although that wasn't bad at all.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|So, having read the reviews before reading the book, I had a somewhat tempered expectation of how good the book was and as such, I wasn't as put out by some who thought it was 1 or 2 star material or was upset that it didn't contain certain popular perspectives in the story. Still, I agree that A Feast for Crows is probably the weakest entry in the series up to this point, mostly due to the lack of any chapters dedicated to the series three most popular characters for most people. While we do get chapters about characters that most enjoy and are central to the main narrative like Jamie, Brienne, Samwell, Arya, Sansa and even Ceresei, there are what feel like to me, lots of filler chapters where half the time I didn't know who the characters even were or in some cases, knew and just didn't care. Finally, the first half of the book really struggles to find it's voice and all these things combined end up making this a more challenging read than the first three and not as enjoyable overall. In the end, the only \\"filler\\" chapters I ended up being interested in at all was the Greyjoy/Iron Island story line though I certainly don't think it is integral to tell the main story.<br /><br />Still, it needs to be pointed out that it's a bound to be a bit more difficult to judge the book on it's own because until books 5, 6 & 7 come out to complete the tale, it's unclear how well this chapter fits within the whole narrative. The story picks up directly after the events of Storm of Swords and really does little to change the game except towards the very end for two pivotal players and depending on how the story continues, possibly a couple other minor players. While this review probably does appear pretty negative to this point, I will say that the book really starts to pull things together around the halfway point and by the time you're 3/4 of the way through the book, it really begins to hit all it's marks quite nicely and finishes strongly. It's a shame it took so long to get the ball rolling because once it did, it felt like he was really starting to hit is grove and then the story had to end.<br /><br />So, all in all, I'd say the book was well written fantasy/drama (still pretty light on the fantasy for the most part), but suffers from too many \\"filler\\" chapters of characters that most of us don't care about and that don't appear to be all that important to the main story except that he's taken the time to make them part of it. Still, since this is the middle of a much longer story it's a little difficult to judge it on it's own since it requires both the books that precede and that will follow it in order to appreciate in context.rolling because once it did, it felt like he was really starting to hit is grove and then the story had to end.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|I never had a chance to pick these titles up when they were on the ps2. Now that I have them I can see why people rave about them. Even though the graphics are dated (even with the HD upgrade) it is still an awe inspiring moment to see the first colossus or go through the expanses of the castle in Ico. These games are no frills and do not give a deep story but it does immerse the player in an unforgettable environment. There are a few moments when trying to figure out puzzles does become tedious but for the most part the game play is intuitive. If you played it before and you feel nostalgic get it. If you passed it up once before do yourself a favor and pick this up!

B005DF2QMC|5.0|This cassette adapter was simple to use, worked perfectly with no glitches at all. I had a hypnosis tape I had used years ago but wanted a digital copy for my mp3 player. I put the included CD into my laptop, downloaded the program and then I put the tape in the machine, plugged the USB into my laptop, opened the program and pushed play on the cassette player. The conversion was about twice as fast as it would be to play the cassette and it worked perfectly. The only slight drawback is that the cassette player has a slight hum to it and when the speaker was not talking you could barely hear it. I used it on a music cassett however and could not hear the hum at all during the music, just slightly through the pause while the songs were switching. I highly recommend this Cassette to MP3 adapter, it was well worth the money!

0321704452|5.0|I truly appreciated what I learned from The Naked Presenter by Garr Reynolds. The most valuable topics for me were in the beginning of the book. I learned that the presentation should be more of a conversation with the audience, and that because the audience is there to hear you speak then the talk is for the audience and not for yourself. His concept on being naked for your audience, which he equates to being open, honest, vulnerable, passionate, I believe will help me be more effective in all speaking situations. It's very easy to fall in the trap of trying to not look stupid, being very cautious and careful, and playing it safe when making a presentation. Reynolds tells us that this leads to boring, unimaginative presentations.   The book illustrates a great balance of story-telling, technique-teaching, including special insets from world-class speakers, and summarizing the most important points at the end of each chapter. I got a lot from the bamboo lessons on flexibility and strength and from the other illustrations on martial arts and Japanese culture.   Overall, this is one of the better and more useful business books that I've read. It's a beautifully designed and illustrated book. Granville Toogood, in [[ASIN:007174326X The New Articulate Executive: Look, Act and Sound Like a Leader]], says that personal communication is a lost and dying art in the workplace. The Naked Presenter effectively reminds us of the elements of public speaking that go together to make a memorable presentation. If you are communicating to any audience, formally or informally, the principles in this book will help you win.
B0055SWM08|5.0|App looks great and has great graphics. Challenging and fun. Addicting! Good replay and tough to master. appstore reviewing system is annoying tho.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|barely notice the ads. they do pop up once in awhile which is annoying and distracting. this is why its free, so either deal with it or buy the ad free version
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I prefer this to my stock samsung,  Android and swype keyboards and the SlideIt keyboard that I bought. Even without the swype/slide feature,  the word prediction and ease of use are unparalleled.  It's also got cool features that show your keyhit accuracy and typing accuracy and let's you choose up to 3 languages.  Dev also seems responsive.  Samsung Skyrocket
0307891402|5.0|I don't normally buy guides even for games like Skyrim. I never did for Oblivion or Morrowind but I knew something about this guide would be special and boy was I right. This guide is BEAUTIFUL. The font and pics are a bit small but any bigger and the guide would be HUGE not that isn't already. This is truly a collector's edition and for the price Amazon had it for it was an absolute steal! This guide is worth much more than it was listed for. If you can find it for a reasonable price, do yourself a favor and snag it!

B000001E8S|5.0|Wow...I couldn't believe how amazing this album sounded.  I heard of this album after watching fan made music videos on YouTube with THX 1138 scenes for the clips, such as \\"United Colors\\" and \\"Your Blue Room.\\" After receiving it I copied it to my iPod Nano 5G and listened to the whole thing in one day. \\"Slug\\" and \\"Your Blue Room\\" really stood out to me. \\"Slug's\\" mixture with calming, new worldly-like sci-fi sounding music, electronic bubbly popping than sounded strangely underwater-like along with Bono's amazing voice made a perfect master piece. \\"Your Blue Room\\" was like the \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\" of OS1. It's blues-like organ along with Bono's deep voice made it a perfect song to put in a sad sci-fi love movie. I would totally recommend it to any U2 fan who likes their mid-90's works. Amazing!
B002VECMAE|4.0|With one of the best casts in this year's films, you'll get fine acting, subtle humor and a quest for atonement that will bring a smile to your face.<br /><br />A reporter in love pain tries to earn is salt by (trying) going to war scenery. There he meets a veteran who belonged to a ultra secret and special unit - The new world army! US military trained individuals with special skills like, yes, killing goats with a stare, among much other stuff as preposterous.<br /><br />We have a dual quest here: The reporter Bob Wilton to prove his worth and Lyn Cassady to make up for using is powers for evil - the Dark side - and killing a goat (and as everybody knows \\"No goats no glory\\").<br /><br />With so many films with special military units or agents with weird capacities like GI Joes, James Bonds, which can do anything it's difficult for many viewers to realize that this isn't one of those films. This is supposed to be the \\"real world\\"! Not an action flick. That is the fun of it. The military are usually the most serious and logical persons, they rarely tolerate nonsense; and to watch a country like USA invest considerable resources to create Jedi's it's really funny. Usually the trick to really appreciate action or fantasy movies is to concentrate only in the inner logic of the movie, suspend disbelief...here is the opposite. You have to use your judgment like you were watching a documentary - then you'll have laughs.<br /><br />There are some extra nuggets like Ewan McGregor asking \\"What's a Jedi?\\". For those of you that haven't watched Star Wars, Ewan McGregor interpreted Obi Wan Kenobi - a Jedi!
B005AUWY2W|5.0|I am extremely pleased with this business. My daughter loves Pixar movies, in particular Cars so we had to get her the sequel. In order to get the best price we shopped at Amazon; this business gave us a great price. Even though, we shopped for Xmas gifts in advance and did not need this item rushed, the seller sent the item almost instantly and the movie arrived in three days. When the movie arrived, it was intact and in excellent condition.
B002A9IZ9C|4.0|This is a really good on camera flash! It has a lot of options, everything totally digital and pretty easy to use. The little \\"flash\\" on it is to weak to make a difference at all, so not sure why its on there.... But I love my Flash! However the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is totally wireless and there is only some DSLR's that are. You are talking about very high end, nothing like a rebel or lower end DSLR. So, then when I need the flash to be off camera, I had to go buy a $100 cord to make it work right. Then I still cannot use my camera to change my flash settings... I went into the camera store and asked why it wasn't working. we tried a cannon flash that is pretty \\"equal\\" to this and it works. So if you are expecting to be able to change settings from your cannon it may not be able to do that. Im not sure about all Cannon, but at least mine will not, I can only change things from the flash itself. While its a good flash, if you are planning on using it off camera without a wireless DSLR I would go with a Cannon brand.
B005POK858|5.0|This game is amazingly impressive for $3.99.  Much effort and talent went into this game, and it harkens back to the SNES era of RPGs.  If you even remotely enjoyed FF 1 thru 6 then this is the game for you.  Looks and runs beautiful on my Incredible 2!
0811879542|5.0|This is a great book! We just go it yesterday and we have already read it at least a dozen times. It's got color skills, counting, right and left. My three year old just thinks it is a super fun book!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This genre normally does not appeal to me as I gravitate more towards crime procedurals.  I was stuck waiting and this was the only thing available to read.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought this headset for use as a gaming headset, mainly for World of Warcraft. After purchasing, I found out that the software needed to use the 7.1 surround options doesn't work on a mac. Another thing that is a pain, is that since they are closed eared headphones, you cant hear yourself speak cleary. Im guessing the software that is so important would allow you to blend in some of the mic input to the cans so you can hear yourself talk. BUT, since im on a mac, i cant be sure.<br /><br />Basically, If your on a mac, im sure there are a ton of other headsets out there for much cheaper. I think its pretty nuts that such a large company doesn't support mac. Ridiculous.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It turned on.<br />2. They fit on my head.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Lack of software support to function as advertised.<br />2. Lack of software support to function as advertised.<br />3. ah screw it.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|The cover is flimsy offering little protection. The cover would not be strong enough to hold the Fire upright for viewing even though it was supposed to do so.  The plastic looks and feels cheap, considering the price of $39 at the time I bought it.  I would advise anyone to buy a different cover instead. If you buy this and are unhappy, you will have to pay the shipping costs to return a poor product.  That adds insult to injury.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Since I can't find a place to review the Amazon Appstore app, I'm wondering if this app has similar features.  Does it show up as a little blue icon in your taskbar every couple of hours saying there are updates to it, or other things you buy with it? The Appstore app does that, with the orange icon showing up several times a day \\"asking\\" you if you would like to update it.  Soon as you clear it out, it comes back a couple of hours later.  Also, the apps you download have updates (however major or minor), and every time an app has an update (that you either want or don't want), the Amazon icon pops up on my phone telling me there is an update waiting.  Also, I don't download updates as soon as they come out for ANYTHING and instead wait until I see how the reviews are for that update so I don't make a hasty mistake and can keep the old one if it's better or I'm waiting for a fix.  So, until that time, I am bombarded with reminders from Amazon on the main screen of my phone with NO ABILTIY TO TURN OFF THESE ANNOYING ALERTS. I already have this blue Amazon app on my phone, but I am very hesitant in even opening it until I find out whether this app ALSO has the INABILITY TO TURN OFF THE INCESSANT ALERTS.  I will just keep looking at reviews before I find a satisfactory answer.  I already emailed Amazon about the Appstore app problems (last major update to it was just 2 days ago), and they pretty much sent me a generic email saying \\"at this time, it's not a feature...\\" so I don't want to waste my time with Amazon again on asking about THIS app, and trust that other customers will give me the skinny on how this app functions.  As it stands now, the ratings are poor, but I really want to find out about how much they alert/contact you and whether Amazon let's you control these alerts.  Thank you.
B005LAIGFA|4.0|There's no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio gives a towering performance as J. EDGAR in Clint Eastwood's film of that name, nor that the other supporting performances are equally well-played by a fine cast. I never found the age make-up and prosthetics used to give DiCaprio a remarkable resemblance to the older Hoover a distraction, as others have claimed. His brisk, authoritative manner barking orders while riddled with a personality that covered a whole range of eccentricities, is nothing short of brilliant. All of the main facets of Hoover's life while in office stick pretty much to the truth in the script.<br /><br />But the film's basic flaw is that there's almost too much to tell about Hoover and not enough time to give any of the material more than a surface look. And the fact that the story is going back and forth in time holds up the momentum when it comes to the segments dealing with the Lindbergh kidnapping. What should have reached the peak of intensity in the story is muffled by the fact that the script spaces the event amid a period of other happenings, all of which take away a strong enough focus on \\"the trial of the Century.\\"<br /><br />Eastwood's direction of the players is so strong that this flaw doesn't really matter in the end. He gets across a full illumination of the kind of man Hoover was, despite all the complexities stemming from his attachment to a dominating mother (Judi Dench) and made even more apparent by his singular attachment to his fellow co-worker at the FBI (Armie Hammer) as Clyde Tolson. Scenes between DiCaprio and Hammer reach a peak moment in their physical struggle as Hammer reacts violently to Hoover's admission of getting \\"serious\\" with Dorothy Lamour.<br /><br />Many personalities of the '30s and '40s are impersonated from time to time, the least convincing being the child actress chosen to represent Shirley Temple, who adored the F.B.I. Aside from blonde ringlets, she in no way resembles that child star in looks, speech or manner. Much closer are Ginger Rogers and Anita Colby. Nixon is played by an actor considerably more handsome than the original and Josh Lucas only makes an acceptable Charles Lindbergh.<br /><br />But whatever casting flaws there are, all of the main supporting roles are very capably entrusted to the right people. Naomi Watts does a fine job as Helen Gandy and Judi Dench is likewise admirable as Annie Hoover. In the end, though, it's a good film that might have been great with a tighter script.<br /><br />And certainly, DiCaprio can look forward to an Oscar nomination for Best Actor of 2011. Whether he wins or not, it's a role he put a lot of guts into and the payoff is there for all to see.ogers and Anita Colby.

B004ZN9NCY|4.0|What an interesting album. The remastering didn't blow me up, but it does sound good. The packaging is weak. Theres nothing extra or special here.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is what it should be. It's light and seems to be durable. It is not made of cardboard like some are saying. The stand works perfectly when the Fire is in place.This is why I don't pay much attention to customer reviews. Most people don't have a clue. All I can say is the negative reviews are probably occupy wall streeters who expect a bomb resistant gold plated case for 5 bucks.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|The movie is great!  I give that five stars.  But until the ultraviolet is fixed it doesn't deserve it.  Others have complained that it's not a digital download but a streaming video.  And I couldn't even get THAT to work so I have nothing and there is no number to call or contact info to fix it.  Terrible terrible terrible.

B005NKIQ26|4.0|I have never owned or heard a Bieber album let a lone a christmas song from him. I was shopping for some new christmas music and saw this, figured it had name stars, but what really got me was Usher and Busta. I listen to the Busta ft. song Drummer boy and wow I was impressed. I would say that half the album is good. The only complaint I would have is I don't like the last song silent night. This album is good, and if your a Bieber fan you'll like it.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I am a big Drake fan because the songs he writes, especially the one's like \\"Doing It Wrong\\", relates to me and what I'm going through in life. I heard the album straight through, didn't skip one single song. It is a slow-paced album, I wish there was more rapping than the slow songs because I enjoy his rapping but if you listen to the lyrics I am extremely impressed. I love this album more than Thank Me Later and I cannot wait until he comes out with another CD!
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Aside from the actual movie plot/content (which I heartily approved of, but enough people have already commented on), it looks great on blu-ray, and what special features there were were quite enjoyable---I especially liked the conversation between J.K. Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe, and the discussion of the women of Harry Potter.<br /><br />My only disappointment was with the digital copy.  I usually buy movies with digital copies because I like to have a copy of the movie on my iPod.  Not only did this digital copy have a strange process of \\"retrieval,\\" making you set up two accounts on the internet in order to access it, but in the end it wouldn't even download into iTunes.  It wanted me to download and install a completely separate application onto my computer.  To be honest, I'm not sure how it works in the end because I didn't download the application. Just a warning: if you are expecting the usual, easily-transferable digital copy to come with this product...you might be disappointed.<br /><br />To sum up: GREAT blu-ray, not so great digital copy.  Just for the movie alone, though, this is a great buy!
B005V5WBFG|4.0|Works well to backup contents (inc photos).  I like the autobackup feature.  It was easy to register and get up and running.
B00005CDNK|2.0|Having owned all of the main ABBA albums on Atlantic vinyl for some years, I find these latest remasters to be very poor sonic representations of the original releases.  The principal offense in this regard has been the indiscriminate use of digital compression by the attending audio engineers, resulting in a sound which is louder and punchier overall, but with a tremendous loss of dynamic range and increased distortion, especially at higher volume. This is just dandy if you plan on listening in your car, on your tiny boombox, or through an Ipod, but the limitations of this technique for \\"enhancing\\" sound will be immediately evident upon even the most casual listening through any marginally decent HiFi system.<br /><br />The original Polydor issues of all these albums (still available used on Amazon and that auction site) in fact have substantially better audio quality, assuming, that is, that you take the expression \\"better audio quality\\" to imply such pesky things as a conspicuously enlarged stereo image, greater acoustic separation and dynamic range, and a lack of distortion at higher volume. While a bit more difficult to come by than the 2001 and 2005 remasters, the original Polydors (UK and West German) are all reported to be flat transfers from the original LP masters; as such, the dynamic range is completely intact, and no noise reduction has been used. For me, this is the ideal way to listen to ABBA in the digital format.<br /><br />If, however, you would really like to hear what all the fuss is about ABBA, just get yourself a modest turntable and pick up some of the original vinyl pressings on that auction site or at your local flea market/thrift shop. I assure you that, having done so, you will cease to consider altogether the question of which of the latest newfangled digital ABBA remasters to get.
0811879542|5.0|\\"Thanks a lot, Mom.\\"  This was said with dripping sarcasm because I purchased this book for my granddaughter a few weeks ago. She loves it!  She loves it so much that my daughter has already read this book to her approximately 36 times.  That does not count how many times Daddy or Grandma has read it to her.  She is a very bright five and can't get enough of this book.  Shaking!  Counting!  Colors!  Giggles! Simple words for directions! Since Grandma taught English for thirty-eight years, she highly approves of any book that can generate this much interaction!
0385335997|4.0|This third book to the Outlander series follows Claire Beauchamp as she continues her search for her lost love back in time. When her daughter, Brianna, and Brianna's boyfriend, Roger Wakefield, find some documents with Jamie's signature after the Battle of Culloden, Claire realizes that he is indeed alive and makes plans to go back in time. The narrative moves between Claire in the present and Jamie in 18th century Scotland.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book as much as the previous three, but it was unnecessarily long. In fact about 3/4 of the book was very engaging and then puttered out when Gabaldon kept adding even more and more silly adventures. I don't understand why she just didn't save it for her next book. There was so much nonsense about drunk priests, slaves acquired by accident, and too much narrative on their sea journeys that did nothing to further the plot. I quickly became irritated with the lack of editing. Many of the characters were useless and were dispatched as quickly as they appeared. This means they had nothing really to add to the story except filler.<br /><br />The ending was a disappointment and some of her choices were ridiculous. There was a lack of wrap up in some of the more important supporting characters which could have been done better. I even skipped several pages that only served to interrupted the thread of the story.<br /><br />As I said, engaging for the first 3/4s. 700 pages would have sufficed than the extra 300 pages of junk at the end
1451627289|5.0|Had this delivered on the first day available then dove right in. Read all 800+ pages in a little more than 2 days, coming up only for meals and some sleep. As a student of the JFK era and assassination I couldn't wait to read King's interpretation of the times, the people and the act itself. His story is bold, sweeping, highly detailed and memorably told through the eyes of a time traveler given the task of saving JFK, and coming to learn that nothing is ever as simple as it seems. Read this epic work, you will not be disappointed.

1553655427|5.0|\\"Dead Aid\\" is heroic in its bold criticism of foreign aid to Africa.  I say heroic because it flies in the face of popular opinion of the intellectual class and the world's celebrities.  The author makes well reasoned arguments showing why foreign aid is not only not working, it is counterproductive to economic development in Africa.  Aid is bad economics and bad policy in that it redirects economic resources to inefficient uses and incentivizes corruption and conflict. Far better the author argues to encourage foreign direct investment, free trade, nurture African financial markets, and use financial innovation such as micro-lending.  If the West just wants to continue feeling good about itself, it will continue the same failed policies of foreign aid.  However, to actually generate economic development in Africa, the West should heed the advice given out in this book.  When you think about this problem it really boils down to the question, have you ever helped someone's long term economic outlook by providing them a welfare handout for life?
030788743X|5.0|Seriously, Cline has created a dystopian nightmare/wet-dream for the stereotypical gamer geek of the 70's/80's.<br /><br />Parzival, a penniless street rat in the real world but a smart and resourceful treasure hunter in the global online gaming/entertainment-fusion platform of the future, OASIS, is on the hunt for The Egg. The first person to get it will inherit the entire fortune of the most celebrated geek of the near-future... the man who created OASIS. Problem is, everyone in the world is looking for the keys too... and not everyone is playing fair.<br /><br />Filled with geek culture minutia that run the gamut of video games, movies, rpgs, etc., Ready Player One scratches the itches of both nostalgia and sci-fi adventure beautifully and to great effect. There wasn't a page turned that didn't have either something tugging at my memory of multimedia past or keeping my attention with crisp storytelling.<br /><br />Really, the only flaws I could find were in the side characters Aech, Art3mis, Daito and Shoto... all major competitors for the prize. While they're not the faceless corporate drones that the IOI folks are, they're never really fleshed out as interesting characters. This is especially true of main character Wade's love interest, Art3mis. Their entire courtship is played out as second-hand knowledge instead of anything actually passing between them on the page. I'd rather have read the romance than read Wade talk about the romance.<br /><br />Still, the stylistic flaws in the book are heavily overshadowed by the enormity of geek uber-culture sprayed across the pages. As predictable as it could tend to be (hello, the coin and the bomb? so telegraphed), this is the sort of gamer adventure that books and movies like The Wizard and Hackers ought to have been (if they weren't trying to unsuccessfully capture the idioms of their present days respectively). Ready Player One is exactly where it should be, off into the semi-near future that's believable while referencing everything important from the past.<br /><br />I only hope that it stands the test of time.past.

B00000IFWE|2.0|I bought this record to help complete my Petty collection. Room At The Top had me hanging on, thinking this could be another Wildflowers album. But where I thought this record would take me was not at all what I had expected. And it's not just that my expectations were floundered, it was simply that this record lost my interest after 3 or 4 songs. Many of them feel like half-hearted blues songs, that really don't mean anything at all.<br /><br />Anyways, I thought Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers were wonderful. As well as some of the others too, but I couldn't really feel connected to this record. I'm sorry.
0446573019|4.0|A really good book, but the similarities between the main character and Jack Reacher of the Lee Child books are way too numerous to ignore.  Baldacci is better than this.  It is a good book, a great book actually.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stop picturing the main character as Reacher.
0061969656|5.0|I have always enjoyed Bernard Cornwell novels, especially the ones set in England and Europe.  I have read the novels leading up to Death of Kings, and always had high expectations prior to reading each work.  Bernard Cornwell did not disappoint me.    This novel flowed throughout and while they characters were many, it was easy to follow each one.  This was a novel filled with intrigue and the key characters and reader trying to figure out the whys behind certain actions and inactions.  I found myself stopping at times, reviewing the clues and trying to contemplate why the Danes did or did not do something as well as trying to figure out the allegiances of certain people.    The intrigue was great and sleuthing the reader could do was invigorating.  The novel flowed well from beginning to end and the subplots were a great.  Cornwell's subplots add a key element to his works and give reader an additional challenge to solve.  Until the end, the unknowns kept you guessing and thinking.  I am looking forward to the next book in this line.
B0056FMNYA|5.0|Kudos to whoever came up with this idea. I find it much easier carry my two dslr's around an event. Works well with long lenses, however it is not advisable to carry a camera with a flash head. Too sloppy. It would be more attractive if the price was lower.
1451627289|1.0|Somehow through sheer force of will alone I've made it through 57% of this novel and I don't know if I can read another page. I'm finding it very difficult to care about the characters, let alone the eventual outcome.  This might have made an interesting novella if it were pared down to a manageable size...instead we are forced to read through one bloated paragraph after another, weak (at best) character development, dialog which doesn't have the ring of authenticity and pages of minutiae which add nothing to the pace, let alone content of the story. Enough!  I hate to give up on a book half way through but in this case I feel like the time I've lost getting this far is time I won't ever get back. Well, not unless I could find a version of Al's diner in my own small town.  This is one I just can't recommend in all honesty.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This really is my first review here, but after reading most of the initial reviews of this product I had to speak up. Like another individual, those early reviews had me wishing I could cancel my order for this case; however, I received it today and I am delighted with it. I have 3 other Kindles (of varying ages), each with a different case. My favorite was the one with the built in booklight until I got the MicroShell. This case holds the Kindle snugly, feels good in my hand, doesn't get in the way and doesn't add any weight to an already comparatively \\"heavy\\" Kindle. It maintains a sleek appearance and acts as a perfectly sturdy stand as well. Now, if only it came in red or yellow or purple.....
0743270754|4.0|Lincoln, once in a speech used a compelling metaphor to underline the perils of slavery. He compared it with a poisonous snake. To strike an emotive cord he compared the poisonous snake found in a newly made out bed where children would sleep later. Would anyone not kill the snake? Right there, he 'pushed' the thought in every listener's mind. William Seward, his worthy competitor, used the metaphor of 'Trojan Horse'. The later resonated only with people who had to think, unlike for everyone whose 'emotional brain' went to auto-pilot hearing the snake story.  Right there, the author claims is Lincoln's key persona. A story-teller, humanitarian and perhaps the best communicator executive this world ever had. But even above these rare traits, he had an emotional control that transcended personal rivalry and earned him tremendous respects from all who were even his bitter rivals once upon.  'Team of Rivals' is a long but fascinating read for every leader. The last chapter is so vivid it could bring lumps to your throat, especially the narrative of Seward just 'knowing' President is 'gone' as otherwise he would have been the first one to call upon Seward's injury that he sustained the same night.

0553208845|1.0|Hesse utilizes a minimalist fable formula to regurgitate worn out cliches of philosophy, such as 'follow your own path' and 'love everyone and everything, love is all powerful.' No wonder this book was a favorite of the hippies during the 60s. Hesse fails to cosntruct a genuine character to embody his banal philosophical points, as Siddhartha displays immense selfishness in relation to his parents, his friend Govinda, his mistress and son, the merchant, and the ferryman. He chooses his path - trampling and running roughshod over the lives of those around him. For example - the ferryman tells Siddhartha he should let his son live on his own in town. However, Siddhartha refuses to abandon his ascetic life on the river and move into town with his son, where his son would be happy. RATHER THAN displaying the selfless transcending love of Nirvana, Siddhartha obsesses over his own broken heart, caused by his son's rejection. Siddhartha ignores the consequences as he pursues his own path - all fine and dandy to experience everything for yourself - even the negatives - but not everyone gets to live to be 70 years old - some of us will not survive so long to make it through the negatives and reach his state of Nirvana in the Eleventh Hour. The books concludes with Siddhartha having created a very empty life for himself, void of friends (he again rejects Govinda) and family.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|If you're thinking of cheaping out on a new CPU --  don't.  But you also don't have to spend a whole lot to get something powerful, versatile and efficient either.  I'm not into the over clocking scene so I picked up the standard 2500 model and I have been nothing but impressed with the performance. Very few software apps are written to take advantage of more than 4 cores in the current environment, so you really don't gain a whole lot going to the 6 or 8 core competitors.  If you are really in budget territory, the i3 Sandy Bridge range is very competitive, but if you don't feel like forking out money for the 2600, this is a nice price point.  I don't think the factory cooler is very good - I opted for a Cooler Master - the processor rarely gets above 30-35c even under the highest gaming loads.  There isn't anything I can find even to nit-pick.  This is a good processor for a good price.  Oh yeah, no Hyper-threading, but I've yet to encounter anything that would make me miss it.
B001LF347E|5.0|I spotted the DVD in our local library last weekend. Never know what to expect and don't recognized any of the actors. After watching the first DVD a few minutes later, we all hooked. The acting, script, story, pace, scenery, magic and everything are great. Not only we enjoyed the show, but there are lessons that we learned as well. There are so many times we laughed, especially when the dragon laughing over king Uther married a troll and the conversation at the end of each episode between Merlin and Gius. Thank you BBC for this great family show. Well done.  Will definitely like to own the whole series
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|In a world of ringtone rap, Drake's \\"Take Care\\" album is a very welcomed change.<br /><br />Listening to the whole album you can tell why Drake pushed the album back to work on it some more. This is a great sophomore album for Drake and his lyrics and flow have only improved since his first album. If you listen closely you can tell Drake really poured himself into album lyrically and gave it all he had before releasing this one. If you liked the first one, this one is only better.<br /><br />\\"Take Care\\" is Drake at his best so far. Get it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />If you don't like Drake, its all good, enjoy your ringtone rap!

B004LUS390|5.0|When I first purchased this app, I was amazed. As of recently I don't know what has changed but it no longer works on my Epic 4g or my Samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The program works as long as you don't try to zoom out or in. After you do so, you are no longer able to draw or resume the work you have started. Until this changes I will not alter my rating and I will check back often.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Since the Amazon App of the Day, this program has worked flawlessly, I haven't seen it crash, freeze up, glitch, nothing. By far the best drawing app I have come across. I use this for many concepts where I see someones work and I would like it altered, adding my own touch to an image, or just a great way to show someone what you mean with a layout and emailing the picture of your thoughts. It's worth every penny.

B005974C94|5.0|Wow, where do I start. This CD/DVD set for a measly 15 bucks is the best album that I have heard in years. When I have a copy in my main stereo, and a copy in my auxiliary stereo, and a copy in my Bose auto stereo, I mean business. The music is a work of art. The artistry of Eric Clapton and the artistry and leadership of Wynton Marsalis comes together to bring Jazz, Blues and Rock with a heavy New Orleans influence to our musically starving ears and brains. Track by track, we are treated to great rhythms and old time blues brought back to life by eleven awesome musicians. The biggest peasant surprise is Layla. This song has been done many ways by Clapton, but this is by far my favorite. There is a modest chord change mid tune that totally changes the song. The drumming is New Orleans street level drumming just perfect for the tunes selected. Every song is well done and grows on you each and every time that you cue it up. Buy it, buy it, buy it. If this does not win a Grammy, than the Grammys become null and void in any meaningful way.......enjoy.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This review is for the digital copy. What a joke! I had to log in twice for flixster and then for ultraviolet. I was so disgusted I uninstalled the program from my computer (who knows how I can view it on my iPad or iPod). There's also an opt-in for Warner Bros to gain access to my account (check whether you want 1 year or 6 hours or don't agree). If you don't agree, you can't move forward. Learned this the hard way and I was put into a loop. Seriously, this took me 30 minutes to figure it out and I'm not tech-stupid. I wish I had just bought the iTunes version for 5 dollars less. At least I can view it from my computer, my devices and with an HDMI cable, I can watch on my TV too. Sad, sad, sad. Should have listened to the reviews about the ultraviolet copy. Avoid at all cost. What a joke.

B005EHNMWM|5.0|This is certainly one of the best Wilco albums.  There has never been a better decision than to add Nels Cline as a guitar player.  I do not believe that any album without him compares to the albums with him, although I still love every Wilco album.  Nels Cline has been there for three albums.  Sky Blue Sky is one of the best albums of the decade.  Yet, I think there are a one or two weak songs (ie. Walken).  The Whole Love, although it does not match a few of the better songs of Sky Blue Sky, overall is a better record since every song is solid.  There is not a bad song here.  One of the best aspects of the album is that they use styles from every album.  This is a must have for every Wilco fan and a great introduction for the uninitiated.  I cannot wait to see them live in Detoit on Dec. 10th,    Great engineering, great songwriting, great overall!

006207993X|3.0|I absolutely love this book. Over a period of decades I have read it over and over. It is like a comforting glass of wine. Elements of intrigue, fantasy, science fiction, timeless literature and occasionally a \\"Twilight Zone\\" like episode are to be found here. Keep in mind always the time period in which Ray Bradbury wrote these short stories. Which brings me to my major complaint about the HarperPerennial edition. WHY change the chapter heading dates??? Why not also put ear buds on the Mona Lisa? Just to make it \\"relevant\\" to \\"now?\\" No thanks, hence 3 stars for THIS edition- NO reflection at all on the book itself, a masterpiece.
B005Y29XFM|3.0|I purchased the case from Best Buy thinking \\"cool... a steel book of Lion King\\" Waited for the release of the dvd/blu ray version... and when it came out there was a 2 disc blu ray and a 4 disc blu ray 3D. The steelbook case only holds 3 discs. So you are stuck with an empty spot or an extra disc. Note: The pictures above do not show digital copy disc in case because it will not hold it. The steelbook advertised above was used as a promo for Best Buy as a pre-order for the Blu ray release.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|As of 2011, this show has won more Emmy awards than any other miniseries and four Golden Globe awards. Tale is focused upon the underrated John Adams (our second American President) and the first 50 years of this country's emergence. There's a lot of accurate details about the period in this miniseries and even though it isn't 100% historically accurate it's better than most presentations and in the eyes of some that's as good as it gets (see David Hinckley of the N.Y. Daily Times). While it deviates from the actual book it was based upon I don't care to nitpick on the historical inaccuracies as the rule then becomes they have to get it 100% right and if that's the measurement bar well nobody is going to want to make anything historical again. That said, I am still an enthusiast for historical accuracy so I'll mention some of the major mess ups below. Anyway, the cast is incredibly impressive: Paul Giamatti as John Adams, Rufus Sewell as Alexander Hamilton, Laura Linney as Abigail Adams, David Morse as George Washington, Tom Wilkinson as Benjamin Franklin, Zeljko Ivanek as John Dickinson and several others. The miniseries does a great job in catching the hardship and struggles of the period as well as giving viewers a broad overview of historical incidents that were likely not covered or glossed over in their History classes. Based on a book of the same name by David McCullough. This film was developed in a number of places but a great deal of the footage was executed in Virginia. Critics were mostly positive towards the miniseries but a minority were not happy with it, especially in that some felt Giamatti was unsuited for the role of John Adams (even though he won Best Leading Actor from the Emmys & Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries from the Golden Globes). Speaking of which the Golden Globes and the Emmies both gave it Best Miniseries for 2008.   This is a wonderful miniseries to brush up on, especially if you want to get a mostly accurate coverage ofthe bigger points during the times of our Founding Fathers. HISTORICAL ACCURACY (for a Hollywood picture): B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: A minus to A; PATRIOTIC THEMES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: June to July 2011; OVERALL GRADE: A minus. BEST DIALOGUE: John Adams: Facts are very stubborn things.//// John Hancock: [reluctantly] God save the King.Samuel Adams: God damn the King! Benjamin Franklin: [happily] God bless the King. Who else could've brought such a spirit of unity to the Congress? //// Thomas Jefferson: I expect that any constitutional document that emerges from Philadelphia will be as compromised as our Declaration of Independency. I am increasingly persuaded that the Earth belongs exclusively to the living, and that one generation has no more right to bind another to its laws and judgments, than one independent nation has the right to command another./// Alexander Hamilton: The future prosperity of this nation rests chiefly in trade. Trade depends, among other things, on the willingness of other nations to lend us money. Thomas Jefferson: And how would you propose to establish international credit? Alexander Hamilton: Our first step would be to incur a national debt. The greater the debt, the greater the credit. And to that end I have recommended to the president that Congress adopt all the debts incurred by the individual states during the war through a national bank. The idea being that if the states owe Congress money, then other nations will feel more inclined to lend it to us. Thomas Jefferson: If the states are indebted to a central authority, it increases the power of the central government. Alexander Hamilton: There you have it exactly. The greater the government's responsibility, the greater its authority. Thomas Jefferson: The moneyed interest in this country is all in the north, so the wealth and power would inevitably be concentrated there in a federal government. To the expense of the south. Alexander Hamilton:If that is the case, it is unavoidable if the Union is to be preserved. Thomas Jefferson: I fear our revolution will have been in vain if a Virginia farmer is to be held in hock to a New York stock jobber, who in turn is in hock to a London banker. The opportunities for avarice and corruption would certainly prove irresistible. Alexander Hamilton: Well there you have it, as I have heard said, \\"If men were angels then no government would be necessary.\\" //// Alexander Hamilton: If we're forced to rely on incompetent state militias for our defense, we may as well start learning French now, Mr. President. [chuckling] A national army binds the country much as a national bank does.////John Adams: I have seen a queen of France with 18 million livres of diamonds on her person, but I declare that all the charms of her face and figure added to all the glitter of her jewels did not impress me as much as that little shrub right there. Now your mother always said that I never delighted enough in the mundane, but now I find that if I look at even the smallest thing my imagination begins to roam the milky way! HISTORICAL INACCURACIES OF NOTE: (1) John Adams did not have to cast a tiebreaker in regards to the Jay Treaty (peace with Britain) as it was never that close; (2) Abigail Adam's snipe at Franklin about his affair while he was married was inaccurate as his wife had died several years back; (3) Adams begun correspondences with Jefferson years before his wife died, not after her death.
B005PR44XC|5.0|Very enjoyable.  He has taken a sticky and unbelievable situation (like the sub prime meltdown) and broken it down with the current main players.  He approaches the absurd circumstances behind Iceland, Greece, and Ireland's debt problems with humanity and humor. It's impossible to describe adequately here the completely different ways that these three countries ended up so BROKE.  Commentary on Germany's role as the mainstay of the ECB is entertaining as well. It's like commentary in the director's cut of a movie.  Lewis then moves to the story of California debt as a harbinger of American municipal debt stories, on state and local levels.  It's scary when you realize your town could be next.  As if any city or state isn't buzzing about the pensions of public service workers, particularly police and fireman?  This is a seminal topic that will be center-stage for decades to come.  I listened to this book on my MP3 -- I highly recommend enjoying it that way.

068981528X|5.0|The Three Little Pigs is a classic story that we all know. One pig makes his house out of straw, another makes his house out of sticks, and the last pig makes his home out of bricks. A big bad wolf comes for them, one by one, and destroys the first two homes simply by blowing them down. He either eats the pigs or they escape and head for their brother's brick house, and when the wolf makes it there, he goes down the chimney, falling into a boiling pot of water. Well, this version with wolves in the place of pigs and a pig in the place of the wolf takes everything up a notch, and is one of the best kid's stories I've read in a long time.  We start out with the three little wolves who are leaving the safety of their mother's home, and going out into the world on their own. Everything is peaceful at first when the wolves make a house out of bricks. That sounds perfectly safe right? Skipping straw and sticks, and going right for the heavy duty materials, you'd think these wolves would have it made when it comes to having a safe home. Well, the Big Bad Pig really IS a big, bad pig, and he takes that house down with a freakin' sledgehammer like Gallagher gone wild. Who knows what that pig wanted- these poor little wolves were just minding their own business and had -just- left their old home, and here this pig shows up and topples it over with a hammer? So the wolves make house number 2, and this time it's made of cement. This one should be able to take a sledgehammer, right? Nope. That pig shows up again, and this time he's brought a pneumatic drill! The house goes down again, and the wolves hightail it outta there. For round three, they make what some might call a fort. It's a steel home with barb wire, chains, iron bars, the works. And when the pig comes for them this time, do you know what he does? He blows that place to smithereens using dynamite. Again, the wolves just barely escape, and as a last resort, they make a home out of flowers. When Mr. Big Bad Pig comes to torture them again, and huffs and puffs, the scent of the flowers changes him, and he becomes a good pig. The three little wolves and the pig become friends and live together.  The story is already hilarious when you read it, but it's the illustrations that sell everything. Seeing the pig blast the metal house to bits is a sight to behold, and you can't help but wonder what it is that the pig wants from those poor wolves. The expressions on the pig's face are great, and make for a much more interesting character than a basic hungry wolf. This story is short but has a lot of text to describe the homes that the wolves make (especially when it comes to the metal home), and does a good job in letting kids know what exactly is going on with everything. Ever since I started reading this to my daughter a few years ago, she's never asked for the original 3 Little Pigs story to be read to her because she loves this version so much more. You can't blame her, as this one has a lot more going on.  If you still don't have this book yet, you're missing out.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|Thats one of the early lines in the film from Kate, it could also be asked about making a prequel to the much loved '82 classic. Just like in the movie, my answer is \\"yes I do\\". Making a film this many years after a classic and trying to make the story before that movie is challenging.  When watching The Thing from '82 you had to wonder about the Norwegians and the back story, thats why this film is interesting. I went into the film with an open mind. It surprised me in the amount of detail. They really tried to match this up with the prior film as best they could. With the age gap between the films, I think they did a great job.    Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Kate a paleontologist, brought to Antartica to help in bringing a frozen \\"thing\\" out of the ice. She starts out observing and asking questions while Dr. Halvorson conducts his analysis of the specimen. As the story unfolds however, its Kate that uses her head and leads the group. The question throughout the film is- who is human? Nobody is who they seem all the way til the end. And some people you think aren't human, turn out to be only to be different later. The effects and cgi are executed very well here. The examination of a consumed human within a thing is creepy. They even have to cut through a casing around the human- sick stuff. The star of the movie is definately Winstead, although the cast is collectively good. The casting was very good for a film that mixes characters from different countries. One of the best scenes in the movie is when the group gathers for a test to see who is human. This is where Winstead is at her best. Great work here. And the best weapon against these things is THE FLAMETHROWER! Great action throughout the movie- you won't be disappointed. Theres even some time spent in the craft these visitors came to Antartica in. And you'll get that feeling of isolation and fear that the '82 movie was effective at. Not to mention not everyone speaks English which adds another dimension. What could be worse than being in the freezing cold, thousands of miles from civilization and not knowing if the person next to you is human? The movie doesn't end with the credits. Most the people at the theater left at this time. But there is a bridging of this film straight into the '82 film. The dog being chased by the helicopter is here. \\"Thats no dog!\\"  Some production notes that I thought were interesting. There was a million screen captures of the '82 film on a lap top. That was used to create as close as possible, the Norwegian camp. The film used practical effects as much as possible over CGI. The movie was shot in Toronto. The lead character of Kate was inspired by the Aliens films, which you feel a little watching the film. John Carpenter wanted to make an appearance in the film, but this didn't happen because of scheduling.   4 1/2 stars
0451528018|4.0|Dr. Mortimer appears at 221B Baker Street to elicit the help of the famous Sherlock Holmes.  Sir Charles Baskerville is dead, and it is supposed that he died because of a curse on the family.  Now, Sir Henry Baskerville is ready to take over for his grandfather, only will he soon suffer the same curse?<br /><br />I've only had the chance to read one other Sherlock Holmes story--a short story, whose name I've long forgotten, where the clever use of a carriage came into play (by the way, that was one of the only stories I read in high school that I really liked).  My book club chose this small read for the holiday season and I was pumped, but also nervous.  Writings from this era tend to be heavy, very reliant on wordy prose.  Could I penetrate the words, figure out the meaning AND finish this deceptively slim book in time for book club?<br /><br />Surprisingly, yes.  I was pleased to see that the prose wasn't a cripple to the novel.  The pace is brisk, yet still somehow descriptive.  Sure, there are words that are used oddly to modern readers, a bit of the sentence structure that is odd, but of all the older novels, this is one of the most understandable to the modern reader.  Plus, the atmosphere is truly creepy, causing more than a few shivers when I tried to sleep at night.<br /><br />Mysteries tend to focus on the, duh, mystery.  Who did it and how, and can our clever detective figure it out?  There isn't much of an emphasis on character (although for serial mysteries, a detective figure that is interesting and hopefully changing is a big plus--look at Cornwell's, Grafton's, Patterson's, or any other mystery authors' main character).  So I was somewhat expecting the characters--minus perhaps Holmes and Watson--to be boring.  Again, I was proven wrong.  Watson, who I thought would be stupid and boring, was actually really clever (though not as clever as Holmes, of course) and very interesting.  Dr. Mortimer was a nice guy; Sir Henry young and spry; even the ladies weren't stereotypical wimps.  The baddie wasn't stupidly cliched.<br /><br />As for the mystery itself...it is good.  Not great, but good.  There is no pulling the bad guy out of thin air, the mystery follows a logical course.  The problem?  I was expecting more (bad thing, I know).  I kinda wanted Holmes to be more clever, to reveal the bad guy with some sort of ultimate clever plan that would make me gasp and be in shock that I totally missed whodunnit.  But I, sometimes the most dense of readers, was able to clearly see who it was by the final pages.  And having Holmes recap was unnecessary.  Sure, it tied up some details (such as who was stalking them, who cut out the message, etc.), but overall, it pretty much told me everything I had learned earlier.<br /><br />So I know I probably came in with unrealistic expectations, but I won't let that drag down my overall opinion.  This was an interesting, engaging novel, and I truly was interested in solving the mystery.  I definitely recommend.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|First off, I want to say that I LOVE this case. It looks great, it feels great, everything about it is great. However, based on my usage terms, I may not be the perfect fit for it. It's not the case, it's me, as I would like to say. First, the headphone hole is too small for my headphones. I have a heavy duty 90 degree headphone jack and the base is too large to fit through the headphone hole. (This is VERY common with almost all cases I've tested) I must say, I was kind of disappointed since this was not a problem for my iphone 3GS hardcase from amazon basics. The other thing is that it's so form fitting, it won't fit around my invisible shield without looking all bent.   Other than that, I decided to keep the case for the days I decide my invisi shield won't cut it. IT's a beautiful product.

B0067GVTQK|5.0|The case itself is pretty interesting this time.  In order to help one client accused of murder, she has to try to get a stay of execution for a well deserving inmate whose execution date looms. This was extremely refreshing in that the writers did not try to sugarcoat the realities of the con on death row.  He is a repulsive human being.  Nevertheless his mother is willing to get on the stand and call herself a lousy parent just to get him a stay.  The local priest is willing to do the same since he is opposed to his being executed. And our scenes with him only makes us wish he were being strapped down NOW!  This is very rare with death penalty portrayals either in movies or tv. So bravo to GOOD WIFE.<br /><br />Meanwhile, conflicts on the home-office front complicate everyone's lives. Diane is extremely suspicious about Alicia and Will. Jackie, Peter's mother, is intent on causing trouble, as usual. She has to be the blindest parent in Chicago since all she ever sees are Alicia's flaws and never Peter's. The kids themselves are three years older and no longer dewy eyed about their parents, although their parents fall to notice this.  You can now see the young adults they will become. And Eli remains Eli, doing his thing, and thus one of my favorite characters. The conflict between the firm detective and Alicia seems to be on the back burner for awhile. Frankly, I think they should both conclude that Peter is not worth a second more of anyone's conflict with anyone else.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|RomCom's aren't generally my thing, but this one struck a chord.  Sure, it had it's \\"cheese\\" moments, but for the most part it felt sincere and honest. Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling were hilarious.  My only complaint would be that I wanted more Emma Stone in this flick.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|This show finally got a blu ray release and I had to grab this set.  By this season the show really was humming like a well oiled machine. It's humor is right on target. and as a lover of comic books , history and other things the show appeals to my inner nerd. Although I was never one, I can certainly can embrace some of the cooler aspects of it. This show actually makes me laugh alot and on this season the romance heats up between the hot bernadette and the truly ubernerd howard in a good way. Leonard also finds love because lets face it , he's a pretty cool character in many ways.  But it's sheldon that really drives the shows laughs. But even the penny character is quite funny and real. There's not a bad episode on this one. ALthough I have yet to see a bad episode of this show! On blu ray the show looks even better than on hdtv and there's even extras on this for you to enjoy. Surely a show this popular needs to have the first two seasons on blu ray too.
0446547603|2.0|I was disappointed in this book.  I haven't read much of his work, although I did read The Notebook and absolutely loved it.  I attempted to read The Wedding and quit halfway through.  This was my third attempt at one of his novels, hoping I might enjoy it since it wasn't a sequel.  I just found the book to be a bit shallow - shallow characters, fairly predictable, and honestly when I just now put it down I said to myself, \\"ok, cheesy.\\"  I think this is my last attempt at reading his work.  Perhaps others had better luck, or liked the quick pace.  It is definitely a fast read.  I tend to like books with richly developed characters and a more complex story line, and this novel seemed to lack those things.  I didn't find it to be very believable for some reason either.  Sorry Nicholas :(
B005DC68NI|4.0|Okay, here's the skinny on this book:  If you're thinking about self-publishing and haven't made a decision yet, Gaughran outlines several compelling reasons to choose self-pubbing over traditional publishing.  If you're already convinced that you want to self-publish, then the numbers breakdown is very useful, but preaching to the choir.  (Memorize them for arguments!)  I also found great use in the formatting sections and the testimonials at the end of the book.

0385341008|5.0|I read this book in two days, and i loved every minute of it.<br /><br />i've never read a book that was written in the form of letters. when i first started, i thought it would be irritating, however i really grew to love hearing mini first person narratives.<br /><br />i found myself falling in love with all of the characters and i truly cared about what they had to say.<br /><br />please do yourselves a favor and fall into this novel. i promise, you'll love it.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Danielle Steel has never let me down. This book really tells a story of the love between a parent and child. If you have adult children as I do  you can relate to the struggles that both parent and child go through as a child learns to become an independent adult. Its a story of growth and love.
B005XOPEOU|4.0|On their latest effort, Coldplay find a sweet spot between the concise pop songwriting of their earlier albums and the densely layered, atmospheric production of Viva la Vida.  This time, producer Brian Eno's studio wizardry enhances the band's songs rather than defines them. Gone are the seven-minute prog experiments and wandering instrumentals.  Sure, Eno's sonic fingerprint is still all over these songs, but at their heart, they are solid and concise pop songs, beautifully embellished by the lush production, but never overwhelmed by it.  Frontman Chris Martin has stated that Mylo Xyloto is a concept album about a couple whose love perseveres despite the turmoil in the world around them.  Such a storyline is a well-worn rock cliche at this point, but the general sense of hope and optimism echoing throughout Martin's lyrics give the whole experience an endearing warmth missing from Viva La Vida.  \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" starts the album on an upbeat and bright note with its driving post-punk beat and chiming guitar lines, and that momentum is never lost, only giving way to a few brief, well-placed instrumental passages and acoustic ballads.  Singles \\"Paradise\\" and \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" are pretty good representations of what is to be heard elsewhere on the album - big, anthemic productions that pretty much demand crowd sing-alons and emphatic fist pumping.    As Coldplay albums go, there are few flaws here.  Ironically, the Rihanna / Martin duet \\"Princess of China\\" offers no real hook and turns out to be the album's least memorable tune, though it isn't terrible.  Martin relies a bit too heavily on oh's and ah's instead of singing actual lyrics for many of the songs' choruses, but that's a minor criticism.  Ultimately, Mylo Xyloto is likely to please most long-time fans and continue to attract new ones, a balancing act that Coldplay has managed to achieve throughout its decade-long career.
B005NS0VNU|4.0|A long-time R.E.M. fan from the early college-radio days. Am glad to have this 40-song collection to reflect and hear what the guys feel represents their musical career. The best part is the liner notes that has little blurbs about each song and the band memories.
B005POK858|5.0|Kemco puts out high-quality old school Japanese style RPG's. Like Symphony of Eternity which I previously purchased,  Eve of Genesis is beautiful to look at and fun to play. Runs well on the HTC EVO 3D, a pretty high powered phone. The user interface could be friendlier, but that's a minor quibble. Thank you Amazon for a very nice FAOTD.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|Being an avid gamer I've always considered getting a hand held console for road trips (I travel from Boston to NY a lot to visit my family), but nothing has ever come close to the quality of home consoles.  Plus you have to buy all new games, the screen is only 4-5\\" big, and it would just go to waste every other day of the year that I was not traveling (I drive to work).  I've always wished that Microsoft would just come out with a portable version of the Xbox 360 so I could play my favorite games on the road, but unfortunately it never came.  However, once I discovered the G155, and my fiance informed that newer commercial buses i.e. Greyhound, Peter Pan, Bolt, etc. now have wi-fi and power outlets, I knew I had found my solution to bringing my Xbox on the road!  So my G155 came in the mail yesterday.  First of all I have to say that I was able to get an amazing deal on it - $220.95 from Amazon.com warehouse deals, in LIKE NEW condition (and it really does look brand new, with the exception of one or two very small scuffs on the outside of the case).  Then because Fedex was late delivering it, Amazon.com (BEST customer service ever) granted me an extra $10 credit. I have to say for $210.95 this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.    The case itself is beautifully constructed and is made of extremely high quality materials!  It is rugged and durable, and even has dense rubber feet at the bottom of it so it does not scratch when you place it on the ground.  The latch system is very nice and also durable.  Upon opening the system I was highly impressed with the look and build of the screen, pouches (made of a really nice material), protective foam tray that the system sits in, and the case's hinge system.  I swear the case alone looks like it is worth $75-100.  Then I got my XBox360 slim into place (it fit perfectly in the custom made foam tray), plugged in the G155 and console, and turned on Gears of War 3. Man, was I blown away!    The 15.5\\" LED 720p screen on the G155 (although it does have a slightly limited viewing angle, which isn't a huge deal b/c its only meant for 1-2 people) is AMAZING!  It is actually much clearer and sharper than my 52\\" 1080p Samsung LCD TV.  You can even adjust the settings i.e. Contrast, Brightness, and Saturation of the picture.  Also, I'm aware that this unit is advertised as a 720p screen, but when I turn on my Xbox it says 1080p @ 60hz in the upper left corner.  Maybe it can play 1080p after all, but I plan to look into this further. Most importantly there is no lag at all when playing faced paced games, and even the speakers are louder and sound much better than I anticipated.    Overall, I can't say anything negative about this product and I can't wait until my first bus trip down to NY next week.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that has always wished they could mobilize their home console and I would totally make this purchase all over again even at the asking price of 299.00.   Way to go GAEMS!! I can't wait to see what you guys come out with next!

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Unfortunately this title and many more to come from Sony, NBC, Fox, Paramount, Warner Bros, and Lionsgate will have this UltraViolet crap. All 6 studios have banded together to create their streaming service and pull away from iTunes. Not surprising that Disney did not participate in this as Steve Jobs was Disney's largest shareholder. But, Disney is working on it's own streaming service called \\"Keychest\\". To be determined if that will play nice with iTunes or not.  In a world where easier and faster is the focus, this is a step in the complete wrong direction. To use UltraViolet, you first have to create an Ultraviolet account. You then have to create a Flixster account. You then have to either stream the movie in an internet browser or install the Flixster app on your portable device. If you want to download the file, you have to install Adobe AIR and a Flixster Movie collection app...  Too complicated. Too many steps.   I would give UltraViolet 0 stars if possible.   The movie however is great!
B000OVLINI|5.0|Kindle has really got me back to reading and this is one of the best books I have read in many years. Once you start this book its hard to stop. I think everyone will enjoy this book and it is rare to feel that way about anything this day and age.
0786958731|5.0|When Heroscape came out from Wizards of the Coast I was livid.  It was a board game that had fantasy elements and yet nothing in common with Dungeons & Dragons, and yet the Open Game License had been adopted by publishers everywhere to spread the D&D brand far and wide.  It was like Hasbro thought the D&D license was good enough for everybody else but their own games.  That all changed with 4th Edition. The Legend of Drizzt is the culmination of a synchronized brand strategy that's been decades in the making.<br /><br />Long before Drizzt Do'Urden was a duel-wielding archetype envied by every power gamer, I read his originating tale in the Icewind Dale trilogy - along with Bruenor Battlehamer, Catti-brie, and Wulfgar. That was twenty years ago.  Now the guy who was originally conceived as a sidekick for Wulfgar has his own board game, The Legend of Drizzt.  Drizzt, you've come a long way baby.<br /><br />The first thing you notice about The Legend of Drizzt is the sheer size of the thing.  The box is heavy and for good reason - it includes over 40 plastic figures, 13 heavy cardstock sheets of tiles and a bazillion cardboard accessories, 200 encounter and treasure cards, a rule book, a scenario book, and a 20-sided die.<br /><br />Let's start with the plastic figures.  They're unpainted but molded in a variety of colors that match their appearance - water elementals and ghosts are in blue transparent plastic, trolls and goblins are in green, heroes are in dark blue, villains in gray, drow elves in purple...you get the idea. Speaking of villains, Drizzt's archenemy Artemis Entreri is here too in case you're interested in playing an antihero. Up to five players select a placard representing their character that includes critical stats (HP, AC, Speed) along with power cards for that character's class. There are at-will powers and encounter powers. Fans of 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons will recognize how much the tabletop role-playing game has in common with the board game. Critics of 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons will notice how easy it is to turn the tabletop role-playing game into a board game.<br /><br />This isn't really so much a game about Drizzt as it is a modular system that can accommodate any setting.  Change the tiles around, switch out the characters and molded pieces, and the same game could easily take place in Castle Ravenloft or in a dragon's lair, which is why the game is compatible with Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon. You could just as easily use the components to complement your own role-playing game.<br /><br />And that's the brilliance of The Legend of Drizzt.  It takes the elements and branding of the role-playing game and takes it to its logical conclusion as a board game.  The Legend of Drizzt is filled with dozens of fiddly bits, from stances to damage counters to healing surges to treasure chests.  You can even level up from first- to second-level, which officially makes this the real \\"Basic Set\\" for converting gamers to the role-playing hobby.n Dungeons & Dragons will notice how easy it is to turn the tabletop role-playing game into a board game.

0446573019|4.0|I too am a West Virginia native, and we are proud and simple folks, but something you should know.  Most of us know our ABC's, we wear shoes, we have our own teeth, few of us are \\"gap\\" toothed.  We have indoor plumbing and electric lights. Most of us don't steal from our \\"relations.\\"  Keep this in mind.  Baldacci writes a good book, in spite of his insensitivity.  Baldacci hit my \\"pissed off\\" button in the first two chapters.  I did continue to read though.  No, I am not a fan of punishment.  He writes an excellent book.  He was looking for a certain environment, our beautiful state provided this for his backdrop.  Although I will continue to read his books, I hope you keep in mind as you read, his book is fiction, and he set West Virginia back sixty years.  We struggle to overcome a certain image that misinformed people such as Mr. Baldacci has projected.   This book is, as all of his books are, well written, mostly well researched.  Zero Day holds the readers interest until the end.  It has twists and turns. I am curious to see more comments from West Virginia  natives.  Read this book till it's conclusion before commenting.

B005SNP6FS|4.0|LONDON BOULEVARD is a British film that is unafraid to take a long hard look at the dark side of London - organized and unorganized crime, miscreants of all ages, vengeance, substance abuse - and still come up with a 'bruised hero' with whom we can relate.  The film has its problems: the dialects of these 'English speaking' actors is so thick that it becomes necessary to turn on the subtitles to understand the dialogue, some characters are insufficiently define, the music soundtrack overwhelms the action too frequently. Yet the cast of actors is so strong that they overcome these problems and ultimately give us a terrifyingly real glimpse at the low life happenings in that major metropolis.<br /><br />Mitchel (Colin Farrell, looking better than he has in years) has just been released from jail, an experience he never wants to face again, but his old friends such as Billy (Ben Chaplin) tempt him to get back into big crime. Mitchel still stops by the street people to see his old friend Joe (Alan Williams) who warns Mithcel to stay away from Billy.  Mitchel finds a job as a bodyguard for actress Charlotte (Keira Knightley) who stays secluded from the omnipresent paparazzi in her home where she lives with an ex-actor now druggie Jordan (David Thewlis).  Billy learns of Mitchel's new job and informs the local crime lord Gant (Ray Winstone) and a plot to rob Charlotte's home is hatched.  Mitchel will have nothing to do with the plot, warning Gant that he will never work for crime again.  A series of brutal murders occur including the slaughter of old Joe by two young footballers - a deed that enrages Mitchel, but even this need for vengeance is something he cannot carry out.  The plot thickens and other atrocities arise, but Mitchel has fallen in love with the delicate Charlotte and urges her to flee to Los Angeles to rid herself of the dangers and the paparazzi. But despite Mitchel's attempts to stay clean in the midst of the thickening mire that Gant creates, he is thwarted at every turn.  The ending is a major surprise.<br /><br />William Monahan (Body of Lies, The Departed, Kingdom of Heaven) wrote and directed this film based on the novel by Ken Bruen.  It is harsh, it is dark, but it is a fine example of film noir.  Colin Farrell is superb in the every difficult role of Mitchel - his acting skills are polished and his characterization is wholly credible.  The supporting cast - Winstone, Thewlis, Knightley, Chaplin, Eddie Marsan, Anna Friel as Mitchel's alcoholic wasted sister, Jamie Campbell Bower - is astonishingly fine.  This is not a film for the fainthearted, but it is a powerful little movie with many bits of afterburn to keep the audience guessing.  Grady Harp, November 11ery turn.

0062060554|1.0|Based on the rave reviews, I had high hopes for this book.  And the first dozen pages didn't disappoint.  Christine wakes with no memory of the last 20 years, still thinking she's a college student who went home with new man after a wild night out.  Only when she looks at her 40-year-old self in his bathroom mirror does she really start to panic.  It's a nicely written scene.    And then everything goes to hell.  The next 200 pages are just plain tedious -- and ridiculous.  Every day Christine goes through the same routine (\\"who is this man in bed beside me?!\\"):  discovering that she has lost half her life and is married to a man she does not know.  Naturally she accepts this after the first ten minutes so that her husband can leave her to go to his office.  The fact that she has the memory of a goldfish and is basically unequipped to help herself in any way seems not to matter.  After that Christine gets a daily call from a psychologist on a cell phone in her purse that she somehow knows about (and knows how to use, despite never having seen one before) and is directed to a secret journal that she decides (over and over, every day) not to tell her husband about.    It's utterly ridiculous, incredibly tedious, and completely predictable.  Whoever got Dennis Lehane to contribute the quote \\"Exceptional...left my nerves jangling\\" is either an absolute genius or the world's greatest blackmailer.
B0065GG2ZK|2.0|drake can rap but this cd is just too soft for my taste. this is an example of what hip hop should NOT be like. if he came out as an r and b singer then he would be good but as a rapper... uh noo!!!this cd sucks and only die heard drake fans will like this one.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews due to a lack of bonus content, it's not like any is advertised.  Oh yea, it's the internet...people will complain about anything, even stuff they don't buy.  It's a blu-ray set of all the Harry Potter movies, just as advertised.   The only weird thing is that the disk for the Deathly Hallows Part 1 doesn't have any disk art, it's just a black disk.  All the other disks have the original box art on them.  Not sure what is up with that.

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The last installment of Harry Potter was a brilliant narrative by the author. Unfortunately, the movie studios butchered it. So much was left out that unless you read the book, you must have been perplexed. Dumbledore was not the shining white knight the movie made him out to be. He was killed when he tried to possess the Deathly Hallows for himself. That is why Harry Potter was the \\"better man\\". The fight scene was whittled down to a total botch job when compared to the book. I was so looking forward to the marching desks on the attack. So much was changed that it affected the characters representation. If you want to know what really happened, read the book.

B0067H9W72|5.0|I love these shows.  They are excellent! Of all the Living Dead movies I've seen, I think the original Night of the Living Dead and the one with the red-headed girl and her boyfriend on the motorcycle (ripped stockings and piercings) were two of the most memorable.  This shows the complexity of human emotions. In this series, I started off disliking Daryl (alleged hickbilly), but he is somewhat of a hero to me now.  He's got heart!  Shane is not all bad nor good, he's covetous and it's hard to wish him any harm in a way for loving as hard as he does.  This is an excellent series!  It's something that my son and I talk about all the time and I've gotten caught off guard quite a few times with the surprises.  I am a vampire and zombie officionada.  I recommend this series to any horror buff. Since I've been able to rent these online, I might be in trouble.   Vickie V.
B001OB4ZSW|5.0|Well, I've never heard his music before when I bought this, so, it was a GREAT surprise. I usually buy 10 or so DVDs of alternative rock concerts to get one pearl like this...  Let me entertain you with a quick story.  My wife IS NOT into alternative music as much as I am. With very few exceptions (Twilight Singers is one band that comes to mind), she thinks my records are awful and she has the (very annoying) habit of judging music by it's commercial success. I was playing this DVD some other day and she asked me: did this guy breakthrough?   I replied: of course not, look at the guy, his clothes, his songs... He is as alternative as it gets. Maybe he has some cult following, more in Europe than in US.  I was astonished when she said: it's a shame he's not that successful, because he's great!  In few words: cool alternative rock, played by a great singer with a great band.   And yes, I bought it in PAL format (but I bought it directly from amazon.co.uk), so, it does not play on all my DVD players.
B004856SQ8|5.0|I loved the TV show and I fully expected this to be a complete abomination as remakes often are. I was pleasantly surprised. They had to change some of the back story but from the beginning to the very end it was a pleasure to watch. The action sequences were throughout and they didn't drown out the comedy which was very important.  The cast did justice to the original characters. I have to say my favorite part was right at the beginning when they flew into US airspace. Makes me giggle.
B005I6EU48|2.0|Neat idea and looks great online but packaging was so poor it was scuffed and scratched and looked terrible upon arrival. Too bad. Return.
B005LJK3AC|3.0|This movie was slightly funny.  It should have been a hoot.  It had great stars and Jennifer Aniston looks incredible as always. No matter how hard she tries, she comes across as sweet in some way. Kevin Spacey was right in his element as the psycho.  I rememeber when he first started off as a kingpin in the series \\"Wiseguy\\" with Ken Wahl. He was an excellent bad guy and that's what gave the movie the punch it did have.  With all the talent in this movie, it was not really funny.  I can't explain why.  Oh, I know, it was the guy who kept messing things up for the trio.  Better writing would have helped the movie.

Cher was fabulous and Christina Aguilera's voice incredible. No it isn't going to win an Academy Award for Best Picture but it was by no means unenjoyable as long as you go in without any great expectations.
B005LAJ1CC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  Would very much like to purchase this documentary as a Christmas gift.  I don't understand why this DVD would be released in one country and not another. What is stopping the public from recording this show off HBO?  What is the purpose of waiting for a Spring release in the USA?

B0044RUSZM|5.0|I am so happy with this product that I bought one for my fiances MBP. All you have to do to keep it on the stand is clean the rubber once it gets dusty or dirty and the computer sticks to it like a glove :) My computer has never gotten close to falling off.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I wasted my time. Reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Boring, too long, too strange.  Did I mention boring?  Granted, the acting was good, I thought the kids did very well.  But I will never get those 2+ hours back and I am really sorry about that.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Not much to say, other than it works exactly as described in our HP 2015. Simply unplug the printer, open the small memory door on the side (no tools required!), slide in the stick, replace the door, power on the printer, notice an immediate and huge improvement.<br /><br />I did notice we needed to reset the printer using the orange button on the panel after installing the memory. This was a one time affair.
B003LR4QPE|5.0|Helmut Rilling is a brilliant conductor (I have seen him conduct in Toronto). Speaking as a classical musician myself, I can safely say that these cantatas are simply marvellous. Each voice is balanced very well against the orchestra. This boxed set is a great deal considering when it was first issued the complete recordings cost over $2,000. This is, in my opinion, the only authoritative version of Bach's complete works.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|Considering Amazon sort of pushed this as an accessory for the Fire the disappointment was double.  The flap that is supposed to keep the Fire at an angle constantly collapses.  And the elastic that is supposed to flip over to keep the cover on twists way too easily.  Shame on Amazon for even stocking this.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|This movie has been added to my list of the absolute lousiest movies I have ever seen... This is two hours of mainly ethereal, abstract, wildly absurd, funky cinematic junk...the worst I have ever endured.  A flimsy thread of a plot about poor parenting tries to hold it together....but regardless of the poor parenting and wildly absurd National Geography type photography of sand drifts, stone scapes,sun bursts,blowing grass,etc....the movie still sucks.  Did I mention I thought is was a total waste of time, not to mention, my five bucks!!!!  Gees....How do I get my money back?
B005D0RDKC|3.0|First of all - the sound is what can be expected, but the songs are rare to listen to, but this double cd-album is more for the collectors - \\"I gotta have this\\".

1419702238|4.0|You will be happy to know Greg Heffley has not changed since last book - he is still a selfish, computer game addicted, self absorbed kid, treacherous friend to Rowley and a oppressive brother to Manny, eager to cut corners to get some cash (he is addicted to a Webkinz-like website now and needs moolah for his pet there), and generally showing poor judgment in life.  Drawings are as good as ever, plot is a little drier than in previous books, but my kid still read it in one evening bursting out in laughter.
0439023521|4.0|I adored this book. If I didn't have such a busy lifestyle I would not have wished to put this book down at all. My favorite thing about this novel is how there were no breaks in the story line, it said everything how it should be without the author trying too hard to create stress, tension and anxiety for the reader-I hate stressful books! I loved how the storyline and novel flowed so beautifully. Cannot wait to read more from this talented author.

B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I believe this \\"Christmas Carol\\" will stand up well against any other filmed version I've seen. My favorite version used to be the 1938 production starring Reginald Owen. This one gives it stiff competition. Jim Carrey's Scrooge is delightfully miserable -- much better than some of the ghastly roles he's done recently. I'm delighted to have this movie in my collection and look forward to enjoying it for many Yuletides yet to come.

I've used a cover of similar material on my iPad for over a year and it's held up well. Works fine as a stand for watching videos, too.  I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, unless folks were judging it before they inserted the Fire.
B001229W22|5.0|Whether it's  Ride the Lighting or Master of Puppets being the king of Metallica albums it doesn't matter. Both albums are some of the best recordings ever done by Metallica. Little did they even know it at the time but when this album came out people lined the stadiums in 1986 only to see Metallica. People wanted Ride the Lightning 2 and they most certainly got it.  The defining moment of their careers. They went on to headline with Justice and finally break on through to the mainstream with the Black album (although Justice got a lot of radio\MTV play time).  It was Master of Puppets that really put them on the map. A masterpiece of sweet destruction.

0316017930|4.0|I liked the book. It was easy to read and understand. This book got me into digging deeper in the life of the successful, genius rich and famous. Malcolm G. is right. What you need for success is: luck, luck, luck. There are some important things that Gladwel doesn't mention. I had a feeling kinda like \\"...ah but what about this and that??...\\". The topic he talks about is very complex. In order to explain the reason for things happening there are essential elements that can't be left out. For example the chapter about the rice paddies and plantation (which is the part that I think sticks out from the whole book): If someone is good at math it's not only because he or she grew up in a hard working cultural environment. It's a oversimplification of complex sociological phenomenas. There are many things that affects the mind and the most important is to have a good teacher like John Von Neumann had one of the greatest mathematician of all times - and here it comes the opportunities part-. I didn't like the fact that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States and it says \\"#1 international bestseller\\" on the cover. There are whole nations and cultures out there - western Latin-Americans who are taught and raised with the idea that good living can't be reached if you were born poor and marginal. Malcolm should have written about those things too which would open up a whole new questions why underdeveloped countries are poor.

1423140591|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  After \\"The Lost Hero\\", we were left itching to know what happened to Percy, and what adventures would lead him back to his friends.  I have to admit, I was curious to see how Riordan did this without it being a complete repeat of \\"The Lost Hero\\" with different characters.  While there were some predictable trivial things in this book, it was action packed and chock full of the things that I've loved about all of these books.  How Riordan has kept my attention (I am an easily bored reader) with five books in one series, two in another based on a different set of gods (Kane Chronicles), and now with two more in this new series without getting boring, redundant, and reaching too far for new ideas, I have no idea.  But he has done it, and I can't wait to see the next one in either of these series.
030726999X|5.0|read this book first.  Wish I had read the series in sequence, however I liked this book better than any of the others.  It would be better in sequence, however, because you would have the full background for Lizbeth.  Understanding her character is also majorly linked to the author and his sympathy for women.<br />Really, really liked this series and wish the author had not died prematurely and would be adding to the series.  I've never appreciated a new author's touch on an old subject, as I've heard is being considered.

0802714544|5.0|Some people may regard this book as a modern classic. It is certainly the book which brought John le Carre to the fore.    Before I continue, I'd like to give you a warning. Please skip the Introduction by William Blake, as it will completely wreck the pleasure that you should get from the story as it reveals all, including the ending. You can go back to read the Introduction.    I well remember the first time that I read this book. I was about fifteen and I was an officer cadet at a Naval school where we could assemble in the mess hall every Saturday evening to watch a big screen feature film. I saw The Spy who came in from the Cold with Richard Burton was on the \\"Coming Soon\\" list. I borrowed the book from the school library and read it before I watched the film. I enjoyed both immensely, despite the relatively small differences in the story lines.    Revisiting the book a few decades on has been equally enjoyable experience. As you would expect, my life since those days has given me a different viewpoint, particularly as I served on the IGB (Inner German Border) during my Army days, and spent a lot of time with members of families who had spent years of forced separation from their close relatives. It was so sad.    This book is about the duplicitous games that spies play and how these affect the lives of others. There are lots of descriptions of the plot amongst the hundreds of online reviews, so I am not going to repeat that for you. What I would like to say is that this is a fast-paced story of Cold War espionage which draws you in. Every word and action of every character has to be carefully considered by that person, as any slip could place them in serious danger. That makes the story exciting.    This is one of those books which you simply must place on your have-to-read-before-I-die bookshelf.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|This series started out wonderful, I loved the 1st two book and the 3rd was ok. This one and the 4th one were terrible. The problem is there are too many characters, too much unnecessary dialogue, and the biggest problem is the plot is moving too slow. At this rate the story wont be nearly finished in book 7. Maybe if books came out every year this wouldnt be a problem, but they only come out every 4 or 5 years. I am really mad bc this series was soo good at the beginning.

034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh is a stunning debut novel that will forever change the way you look at flowers.  Diffenbaugh weaves a tale about love, faith, endurance and one woman's battle to overcome her troubled past.<br /><br />The story takes place in San Francisco and centers on protagonist Victoria Jones.  Victoria has grown up in the foster care system and has now become emancipated. Diffenbaugh slowly peels back the petals in Victoria's present and past life, giving us a glimpse of the dynamics that make up this complicated young woman. Told in Victoria's voice, we see her struggle to communicate with the world around her.  It is through flowers that she is able to express herself. Yellow roses mean jealousy, winter cherry signifies deception, and starwort gives welcome.<br /><br />As a young adult, Victoria finds employment at a flower shop, and using the language of flowers begins to communicate with others.  News of her gift, spread and soon people are coming to her for flowers.  She meets a young man, who patiently tries to communicate to her through flowers. Their romance is bittersweet and will not leave the reader untouched.<br /><br />As we journey through Victoria's past, we learn how she came to communicate with flowers.  When she was ten years old, she was taken into the home of Elizabeth.  Victoria suffering from a life spent in a myriad of foster homes and facilities is detached, doesn't like to be touched and trusts no one. She fully expects Elizabeth to reject her.  Elizabeth opens up her home and slowly shows her the meaning of love. She teaches Victoria the language of flowers.  It is through flowers that Victoria begins to communicate and forms her first bond with another human.<br /><br />As the tale weaves back and forth between the past and present, answers are slowly revealed as to why Victoria is on her own and no longer with Elizabeth. The story will captivate you, as you are swept up in this heart-breaking, truthful tale.  Diffenbaugh brings voice to human tragedy, our failed foster-care system and the hearts ability to endure and overcome.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Language of Flowers to everyone.  The novel is beautifully written and the transition from past to present is seamless.  I am adding Vanessa Diffenbaugh to my list of must read authors. This novel would be perfect for a book club and an excellent gift for the reader on your list.<br /><br />I want to thank netGalley and Random House Publishing Group for providing this ARC, in exchange for my unbiased review.tragedy, our failed foster-care system and the hearts ability to endure and overcome.

B005HSG3TC|1.0|This is very cheap feeling.  I agree with other reviewers that this probably very inexpensive to manufacture.  I was on the fence between this and the leather Marware CEO case.  I switched back and forth many times, and ultimately chose this.  I wish I hadn't.  If this was 10 dollars or less, it would be a steal; however, at 40, and even 30, this is not worth the money.  Do yourself a favor and do not order this; you will be disappointed.  As far as function, the Fire fits this cover perfectly, but I would not trust it to protect it very well.  If it were a little more sturdy, and had a little better build quality, it would be OK.  Also, if you line up the cover perfectly with the back, you might be able to get the stand to work (temporarily), although any movement will knock it back down.  I have to give Amazon praise for the ease of the return process, as they made it extremely easy to return the item.  I am replacing this with the CEO leather case, which I wish I would have originally stuck with. Hope this helps!
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|I only have myself to blame, as there have been several negative reviews on other sites that I should have read before ordering. This could be the shoddiest transfer to Blu-ray that exists! Color is washed out and just plain ugly. It's an improvement over the DVD I bought years ago for $4.00, but that's like comparing dog crap to a road apple. Avoid avoid, avoid!!! (At least wait for a BIG price drop.)

B005HSG3TC|2.0|I was so excited this past September when I preordered my Kindle Fire that I immediately added this MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware--unseen and with a trust that Amazon would demand a quality cover for its new flagship Kindle.  Sadly, though, this cover is the worst product I've ever purchased directly from Amazon, especially when I consider its $40 price tag.  My guess would be that the manufacturing costs are far less, perhaps no more than one dollar per cover.  The edges of the hard plastic back case are sharp and make the Kindle (which is heavier than I anticipated) uncomfortable and sometimes painful to hold, especially at the bottom and in the corners, which protrude forward from the device.  The vinyl-like screen cover \\"features\\" a live hinge that doesn't look to me like it will be around for too many folds.  This same screen cover is designed to fold into a stand for video viewing, but it easily slips out of position, allowing the Kindle Fire to drop to the table.  Overall, the intent of the cover (to add protection while offering a built-in stand) is great, but the successful execution of that idea has been undermined by low quality materials and a poor fit and finish.  I cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />UPDATE: Originally, I had rated this product as one star (when the selling price was $40).  Now that Amazon has reduced the price by $10, I have softened my rating somewhat.  I suspect that there are better made, more economical options out there (or coming soon), but a price closer to $20 is reasonable considering that nearly all such covers have inflated prices.
B000GWE44U|5.0|buy it to see jack slowly descent in2 madness. in my opinion, jack really made this movie what it is by his all so believable performance. the second is the hotel itself. the camera work really made this hotel look scary, u would be scared if u had 2 stay there 4 the winter too.

0061765236|5.0|The Pact is a story about Chris and Emily, childhood friends whose relationship grows into something more as they get into their teen years.  They are best friends, soul mates.

Chris describes a suicide pact gone wrong but is subsequently arrested for Emily's murder.<br /><br />The story unfolds through both a series of flashbacks and present day events.

B005EYP8PO|5.0|I have been a fan of U2 since the \\"Joshua Tree\\" days, but even though I do have most of U2's standard albums, I do not have the b-sides and remixes, except those that came with the single \\"One\\". So to me, Disc 2 of this set is like a brand new album, and what an album it is! It is very diverse musically, and it shows how far U2 was willing to go in 1990-1991 in order to search their souls and to experiment, for the purpose of making their next album as excellent as possible. The effect of Disc 2 is that it makes me feel that I have been transported back to 1991 to discover a U2 album that I never knew existed. I was leery of forking over more than $20 for another copy of \\"Achtung Baby\\", a superb album but one which I already possessed on vinyl, cassette and CD. But one listen to Disc 2 told me that my money was well spent. I don't dislike any of the tracks, and I actually prefer a couple of the remixes to the tracks found on the original album.<br /><br />To address the other issues, the sound is great, and I have no problem with the packaging. I'm just happy to have this music.  All in all, I am very pleased with the set.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I love every album from Megadeth, I have been a fan since Peace Sells.  This album just felt right from the first listen, I actually got goose bumps it was so impressive on the first listen.  Every song is solid true to the bone Megadeth, Mustaine has his ire back up and the anger he has towards the world and our currupt leaders shines through in this fine piece of metal work.  I have missed Marty Friedman, but Chris Broderick is awesomme and Dave Ellefson back just makes it that much better while Shawn Drover's drum work just gives it the heart beat of a monster.  I LOVE IT, BUY IT,Period, the end!
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Others have focused on the movie itself and the DVD release. I personally am in the minority who thinks this was not a good interpretation of the heart of the last book, but I don't plan to go into that here. I just wanted to clue people in about the special features.  The only special feature on this DVD is a collection of deleted scenes. To get the 3 featurettes, you have to buy the iTunes version (or, I think the Blu-ray).  The deleted scenes are good. In fact, some of them are better than we've gotten since way back in the early HP movies. In my opinion, 2 or 3 of them should have stayed in the final cut. There are some good moments that fill in the story a bit. (One of my complaints is the length and pace of this last movie.) There are also a few brief scenes that still have green screens, which gives an interesting glimpse into what was and was not real on set. And there is a cute scene where Hermione gets a very fun line.  Considering that the purchase price is so low and that the movies are being vaulted before the end of the year, it's definitely worth getting your hands on a copy, even just for the fun of seeing these extra minutes of footage.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Rolling the Deep\\" I loved it already, but after hearing her 2nd single \\"Someone like You\\" I had to buy her cd. Just like any other cd that I'm excited to hear, I played right away as soon as I got it. All of her songs are all different in many ways.<br /><br />  I really love \\"Rumor has it\\" because it has a rock feel to it, but once I heard \\"Set fire to the rain\\" it easily reminded me of \\"Pride in the name of Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Day\\". And am not suprised to hear \\"Set fire to the rain\\" as the latest single from her. Adelle is a breath of fresh air muscially and and so much talent. Her voice is very rare and unique and also reminds me of being the daughter of someone from the 50's and 60's blues sound....
B005DMNS4A|5.0|I bought the vinyl in 1973, I was only 13 and at the time I couldn't understand it, but I learned to like it. As the years went on I listened and learned more, after hearing all of The Who's albums and Pete Townshend's Empty Glass, I realized Pete was a genius. I bought Quadrophenia in CD format in the late 90's and found the cd a little clearer, actually alot clearer than my vinyl, but by then vinyl was out of the picture, then I burned them to mp3 and it sounded a bit more clearer but today I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. I was wondering if it was going to amaze me as the The Beatles remasters. I didn't have to adjust myself or my stereo to hear all the instruments coming out clearly and distinctively. I guess with 5.1 it brings the music out with clear flavors. I can't believe how the bass came out, how the guitar chimes, how Roger's voice accentuates with his t's and s's. I actually had to sit back in my chair and listen. I'm who can't just sit for 3 minutes, but I was able to actually just sit there for the entire album, well until the demos came out. It's the first time I heard them, so I have to let it sink in, but I mainly bought this for the original. No, it doesn't sound like the original vinyl.... It sounds a hell much better. It brought back lots of memories and sounds I haven't heard before. What can I say, the Who helped me learn how to type. I used Quadrophenia's lyrics for 9th grade typing class and used Quadrophenia for an essay on mental institutions for my 11th grade Social Study class. I could write plenty more on just this new album, but there's no need to. This is a very very good upgrade. Great Job Pete.....
B00479SVBU|5.0|I'm actually very impressed with this. So far I love it. The other transmitters I've tried have sounded like I'm listening to a crappy AM station, but this sounds almost like I'm listening to something out of my CD player. Totally crisp and clear, the remote is a nice feature so you won't have to keep leaning over when you want to change something. I like the pivoting head, and I like the size of the screen. It's smaller than I'd imagined, but that's a good thing. It doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. I am going to purchase one for my wife's vehicle as well.
B004HO6I2E|1.0|The Change-Up  Yet another movie with Jason Bateman. This one included , Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde.  Folks, I can't tell you squat about this movie as I was unable to watch it. It started out stupid and seemed to just get more stupid as it went on. I skipped through the chapters to see if it were going to get any better, and it just didn't look like it was going to be worth the time it would take to sit through it.  This was yet another one of those movies about people switching bodies. The storyline has been done to death and it seems that each movie is worse than the last one.  This one, from what little I saw, was horrible. It was as juvenile as any film that I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I like stupid movies. But this thing was way too stupid.  I figure that I might have been able to skip through 20 minutes of this disaster. That was twenty minutes wasted. I would have had a better time had I spent those twenty minutes cutting my toenails.

B005KDWUFA|3.0|I was around listening to music when the Monkees were created, on a bet that someone? could pick four average teenagers and make them a hit rock group.  The results then, were mixed.  Simon Cowell has tapped a very small part of his fortune to try and create a pop/operatic group from a bunch of people he auditioned. Just like the Monkees, the results are mixed.  The four voices I did not find to be really compatible.  The lower voice had too much timbre for the uppers.  When they harmonized, it sounded like four different voices, in four separate showers.  The song choices were not well thought out, in my opinion.  \\"Don't Cry for me Argentina\\".  Madonna had to sing that for the President of Argentina before she received permission to film and sing it from balcony where Evita Peron made her speech.  The singing of the song by four men who were occasionally pitchy, and whose disparate sounds often actually clashed was not all that pleasant.  AND THEN---\\"Crying\\" by Roy Orbison.  Even old Roy never screeched the high notes as much.  I will stick to \\"The Canadian Tenors\\"  for pop operatic, DiStefano for classic Opera.  Speaking of the Canadian Tenors- They do a song called  \\"Remember Me \\" Music by James Horner, and they sing as one voice, like a piano, they sing so well together. It is very minor key, absolutely entrancing, and I suppose I should put this on their review.  I'm not upset that I bought it, but I thought Simon would have gotten more for his money.  Thanks.

B002ZG980U|4.0|This is a delightful scifi film - it has action, fun concepts, well conceived little details that fit perfectly with the ideas, and beautiful, very good actors.  It held my interest, with the particular hard scifi pleasure of figuring out what was going on, seeking subterfuge and twists but also the fixed parameters of this future vision.  The subplot with the mysterious Cotillard character also worked extremely well for me, a bit of DiCaprio's subconscious but also a real figure; she was the most imaginative of all the constructs in the film, in my opinion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with how fast the whole thing was resolved, like they had to tie if off because they had run out of time or money.  Also, I did not detect any mind-bending ambiguity that got the viewer to question everything at the end, which surely this film was made to do.  Taken together, the producers dropped the ball at the very end and turned it into a mere comicbook ending.  This is a great pity.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|so versatile! it goes with you everywhere across multiple devices seamlessly and holds all types of content. you can't go wrong with this app.
0307477479|4.0|This was recommended to me by my future mother-in-law, without saying much about the story.  So I didn't have any expectations coming into it.  I really loved this book!  It is not for everyone.  The novel is not cohesive, the characters change with every chapter, and you have to pay attention in order to keep up with everyone.  Having said this, I thought the book was very engaging with its depth, and its window into the characters' minds.  They are real people with real flaws, and as I continued reading, I could see these characters walking along side me on the sidewalk.<br /><br />It is not a typical story, and when someone asked me, \\"What is it about?\\", I didn't have a clear answer.  It is about the 6 degrees of seperation, and how people are connected to each other, and basically about the life that each character is experiencing at that moment in time.  It is depressing at times, but at others simply raw and honest.  I think some of the bad reviews come from people's own discomfort in perhaps seeing themselves in the novel.  The claim that time makes on our lives as human beings is not always positive, causing people to hate the direction of the book.  However, story lines like these, are what makes the novel realistic and a good read.<br /><br />If you want to try something different, and move on from the typical novel, then read this book.  I hope you like it!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I heard one of the songs on the radio and knew I had to have more.  This is one of the best works of music I have ever heard.  I never heard of Beth Hart before (my loss) and she is an amazing talent.  Joe's guitar playing is his usual outstanding.  The song selection in great as is the band.  So glad I purchased it.  Every song has something special about it.  It you like blues guitar, Janis Joplin, Billie Holiday and Arthea Franklin (yes Beth Hart reminds me of all of them), sit back and listen.  Prepare to be moved and amazed.

B005H0IW6W|4.0|Listening to this track brought me back to the magic of Christmas I knew as a child in the 1960s listening to my father's albums from the late 1940s. I love the smoothe sound of the ladies and the way Michael plays off of them. This is definitely a must buy album!
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I should have listened to Dreier. Everything he said I have now verified by my own experience with this product. The stand does not work, but slips out immediately and falls flat. It lacks any design quality and actually looks more like cheap packaging than a serious case for an electronic device. Anyone who gives this product more than a star or two must have stock in the company. The product is already in the box for return to Amazon.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|First, this is a great book, one of Stephen King's best. I enjoyed every moment I spent reading it. I also love my Kindle.<br />My problem is with Amazon for selling a product for my Kindle which includes content unavailable to Kindle users. The bonus content included, video and audio, is ONLY accessible to owners of iPads, iPhones and iPods. Not even the Kindle Fire can access the bonus content.<br />How funky is that? Shame on you, Amazon, for catering to Apple users and leaving your own customers out in the cold.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|One of my favorite films as a child is now available in 1080p HD and is presented with 7.1 DTS-HD sound!  If you have not seen The Lion King before, the story is about a small male cub who, destined to be king, runs away from home after a tragedy occurs, which he believes was caused by himself. He eventually grows up alongside two friends who \\"show him the ropes\\" as a child (cub). All is well until an unlikely reunion makes him realize that he has to return to his kingdom, which has almost turned into a barren wasteland during his absence. With his decision to return, he faces a challenge(s) in order to rightfully take his place as the destined and one-true king.  Like most other Disney films, the movie is also somewhat of a musical [for the first half].  This set comes with two discs - the Blu-ray disc consisting of the feature film and special features, and a DVD copy consisting of the feature film and only one special feature from the Blu-ray disc.  There is a good number of special features including never-before-seen deleted scenes/bloopers, a deleted song, an extended scene, a sing-along mode, an interactive Blu-ray gallery, and more.  I really believe that there could have been a little more, even though all of the special features are presented in Blu-ray fashion. Yes, Blu-ray discs can hold a lot of content, but the better the presentation is when there is no loss in either visual nor audio quality due to \\"space cramming.\\" It's not a 50-GB dual-layered disc, but I doubt all 25 GB were used here.
1451627289|3.0|Opens with a dynmanic concept and dramatic appeal that mixes historical fact with fictional revisionism. Unfortunately, however, the literary momentum subsequently wavers and is basically lost to the detriment of the plotline. Hence, several hundred pages are wasted on redundant scenes of watching, waiting, stalking and eavesdropping.  The romantic interludes are vapid and unconvincing.  Furthermore, the \\"hero\\" himself is not developed to any meaningful extent despite the fact that his thoughts and actions appear on every single page of this voluminous novel.  On the other hand, \\"time travel\\" stories always involve a lot of complexities and tricks of logic, and King manages to handle them reasonably well.  I should add that the back cover of the book seems to forecast a possible twist ending that kind of intereferes with the reader's concentration and suspense level. It should be avoided.  Having said all of that, a 3-star rating seems appropriate.  You will be reasonably satisfied if you devote the time needed to devour this novel.  But should you decide to forgo it, you won't really be missing out on a major literary event.

0156027321|5.0|This was a strange book for me to read, and even harder to put into words what I liked so much about it. Yes, it was written very well, with a simple style that captivated attention and drew me into the narrative. But it was more than that. Yann Martel connected me to the main character in a very deep way, so that I suffered along with him, felt joy with him, worried with him and for him as he retold his story. And of course the ending was so well contrived it left me thinking about it for days afterwards and even looking online to see how others interpreted the story. A very good sign of a very good book!
B005I6EU7U|1.0|BIG disappointment out of box as there was a small tear on the center front cover, as if it was 'sliced' w/a sharp object. It would have gone back then; but, to determine if I wanted replacement or refund, I 'tried' to slip my new Kindle Fire in and...uh oh...it's not a good fit. Certainly not one I'd expect for the 39.99.<br />Returning today and my quest for cover continues...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This collection will be under the tree this Christmas tree, I'm certain.  We are a house of Star Wars fans.  Young and old alike.  To the 2/3s of reviewers who pan this release because George added a few more things, I predict, that he will release a cinemaphile (is that a word?) version using the original cut of the first three films. There is clearly a market for it and George has always managed find new ways to leverage the Star Wars franchise to grow the empire.  I am giddy with excitement waiting for Christmas day.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|I have always been a fan of the original Planet of the Apes, so much so that I also was one that watched the other movies that followed the first. Sometimes the sequels were ok, but in my view they never lived up to the original. That being said I have to say that I was completely impressed with this prequel of the Planet of the Apes. The plot, acting and characters were all great and I have to say that the time I spent watching this simply flew by without me even knowing. With the addition of using CGI, the Apes in this movie were superb and just jump off the screen. It makes you wonder what the world would be like if this truly did occur.Overall, this movie was an emotional thrill ride and if you like Science Fiction or the Planet of the Apes movies, you must see this film!
B002N1RM5A|5.0|First a disclaimer:  I adore Jonas Kaufmann and that's the reason I bought this recording.  I am so glad I did.  It's a real delight to listen to: beautiful voice, wonderfully nuanced interpretation, from the excitement of falling in love to the despair at the loss of love, and perfect German.  Furthermore, this wonderful recording is now available at a really low price.  What's not to like?<br /><br />It always amazes me when some critics hold out one voice and one interpretation as the exemplary way to do a cycle of songs.  I often find those \\"perfect\\" interpretations increasingly dull as we move from song to song down the line.  In my opinion, songs are written so that various people can sing them and the more variety there is, so much the better.  This is a recording I will listen to over and over again.<br /><br />Added three years later (March 2014)<br /><br />I still love this recording and listen to it regularly.  How can I ever get tired of such a beautifully sung cycle? By now everyone knows that Kaufmann is the #1 tenor in the world.  Highly recommended.
0439023521|4.0|'The Hunger Games' is a curious novel where in the distant future America is divided up into districts, and each district brutally controlled by the central government.  The government sponsors an annual event where representative children of each district kill each other, with only one victor remaining.  The story is largely based on the much more brutal 'Battle Royale', and unfortunately pales in comparison.  'The Hunger Games' is narrated by a teenage girl, one of the competitors, and unsurprisingly the prose is kept at a PG-13 level.  The characterizations, in the mind of this reviewer, are a bit thin.  Dialog?  On the juvenile side.  Yet having said all this, the book does have some unique elements and twists/turns.  Certainly junior high schoolers would love this book.  Those over the age of fourteen, ... perhaps less so.  Bottom line: read 'Battle Royale' for more realism and horror.  Read 'The Hunger Games' if you want puppy love and mock horror.
B005POK858|5.0|First review I've done on an App, but this one is worth it. Got lucky enough to download this for free, but will buy any that seem similar to this from this developer. It's very reminiscent gameplay wise to finaly fantasy VII, story wise a little weak, but it is an app so you can't expect a great story. Complex leveling system and skills make it fun the only thing it lacks from being a final fantasy is esper,aeons,summons other than that great game.
B001QOGYFY|3.0|This light weight thriller won't make anyone salivate. but it is very watchable. I like Kate Beckinsale no matter what role she plays so I am biased. Kate is US Marshal Stetko, who accepted the most remote post in the world after being forced to kill a fellow officer in self defense. While there she deals with minor issues like drunkenness and theft of a \\"botany sample\\". Nothing exciting, just cruising. Then a murder compounded by a second murder, Stetko barely escaping with her own life. The discovery of a long lost airplane with a mysterious cargo. another murder, the capture of the felon responsible. But, then, betrayal yet again, this by her closest friend, who opts to die in the winter wilderness when confronted. Stetko is left alone on the South Pole with two males for SIX months. Hmmmm. There was one glaring anomaly I thought. February 12, (shown on the computer screen in the communications room as Stetko searched) is winter in NORTHERN hemisphere. Summer in the southern hemisphere. so how could they \\"winter over\\" on the South Pole with that date?
0312430000|5.0|After reading this book it has definitely given me a better insight on how to use checklists. In some of my daily routines I was already using a checklist, but this book has given me the ability to enhance and make it more detailed so I can be more productive and function better with daily tasks. The examples that the author uses are award-winning and great things that have saved peoples lives. It definitely shows that it can help you stay more manageable in daily activities.  Overall, I believe it will help you get better organized in your daily activities and tasks. And it allowed you to appreciate the heroic things that are done in the operating room, on flights, etc. It shows you how to work in a team aspect and definitely gives you a better feel for communicating and working with others.
B004CIIXFA|4.0|This film made a brief appearance in theaters a couple years ago and only made $200K in the U.S.  Why?  Well maybe it's the subject matter or maybe no one can understand these blue collar Brits!  Anyway, the movie finally arrived thanks to a new Criterion edition.  They almost always do an excellent job with their product, but what's with the 4:3 aspect ratio?  Was this movie shot this way for British TV or something?  I had to turn on the subtitles to understand these Cockneys as well.  They are for the hearing impaired however, telling us every little dog bark or car passing as well as translating the language. I'm all for that but there is no English only subtitle option.  Now that's out of the way...I have no idea what the title refers to.  I don't recall any fish tanks in the movie.  Katie Jarvis gives a break out performance playing a 15 year old (she was actually 18) girl living in a tenement apartment complex in Essex.  She's a young tough who takes no crap and usually dishes out her own.  Obviously it doesn't help if you're the shy type with these teens.  She takes a fancy to her still young mum's (Kierston Wareing) new boyfriend (Michael Fassbender, 32 by the way). He flirts a little but is clearly more interested in mum.  One night that changes when mum passes out drunk.  Yeah, a little creepy now.  In any case young Mia (Jarvis) becomes upset when Fassbender's character bolts.  She tracks him down only to find out he has a family of his own.  More tension ensues as Mia kidnaps his young daughter.  We don't know what's going to happen.  The elements of the story are unsettling but there is no denying the quality of the film and its director Andrea Arnold. Since this film surfaced, Fassbender has gone on to make several mainstream films and is one to keep an eye on.
0321704452|5.0|This is definitely a must read for people that struggle with giving presentations. People struggle with presentations for different reasons. Some people struggle because they've never given a presentation. Others struggle because of the fear of speaking in front of an audience. Reynolds presents a full proof way of giving a presentation without a sense of nervousness or fear. For me, what definitely registered into my memory bank as I continue forward with presenting is to prepare and to pace my presentation.   By always being prepared and speaking on what I'm passionate about and keeping my audience engaged my presentations should always go well. I would recommend this book to anyone that struggles with one of these two things.
1419702203|4.0|Just started reading it while out of town on a vacation. And got to page 32 and the book jumped to page 65-96 and then repeats those same pages again 65-96 and omits pages 33-64.

B000001ELF|5.0|When Kiss decided in 1978 to release four simultaneous solo albums,it was understood that these would be completely independent musical ideas from what Kiss were doing as a band. As such it was understood that this might mean incorporating elements outside of hard rock into their sound. The other three solo albums managed to do that-incorporating acoustic and orchestral pop elements as well as funk and disco in some cases. While Ace Frehley is no exception to this,it was apparent he wanted his solo album to rock very hard and be very guitar heavy. That might be way this album is a favorite among Kiss fans into the more \\"guitar hero\\" aspect of it. At the same time there's a lot more here than that too.<br /><br />  True the first five songs \\"Rip It Out,\\"Speedin' Back To My Baby\\",\\"Snow Blind\\",\\"Ozone\\" and \\"What's On Your Mind\\" are guitar heavy hard rockers,they have a bite and crunch very far removed from Kiss's theatrical presentation. No doubt the CBGB punk scene of late 70's New York had an effect on the fierce,direct approach of these songs. Also important is the fact that these songs also showcase his ability with working well with a bottom. The presence of Will Lee on bass and Anton Fig on drums helps out in this respect,giving it sort of a power trio flavor. Of course my favorite song on the album is the extremely funky Bo Diddley/James Brown sendup of \\"New York Groove\\". I really like the way Ace approaches rocking funk. And whatever way you cut it,the song IS funk and loving it! Next up he's back with a kind of surf punk sound of \\"Wiped Out' before rocking out again on \\"Fractured Mirror\\".<br /><br />  There are times when I get a little annoyed at how hard rock and some hip-hop artists take a too easy one dimensional viewpoint to their craft. Not only is it very limiting to the listener but to the person doing the creating. It would be kind of a double edged sword for Kiss as we'd see them being perceived in the 80's as just another hair metal band. But these solo albums made it clear that these four people,as with most musicians,do have the ability and the wish to expand on their sound and on what even hard rock can do. Because many of their biggest fans were under 18 and male,I don't think too many people noticed this.And not to even mention Ace's fine musicianship, a person who is a fan of pop/rock even will find something to appreciate in these albums. Even if they aren't big hard rock or Kiss fans.clear that these four people,as with most musicians,do have the ability and the wish to expand on their sound and on what even hard rock can do.

B000001ELD|5.0|Coming into this not knowing much more about Kiss than even a casual fan,I always had this strange curiosity revolving around the four solo albums each band member put out,on the same day in 1978. By that time,from what I've heard of them there might've been a chance by the late 70's Kiss was starting to grow a little tired and predictable to people who weren't hardcore members of the Kiss Army. Their hits were all beginning to sound of a piece. And from a band who can trace a certain musical linkage back the harder side of the glam rock movement with Iggy & The Stooges and Alice Cooper each member of this band definitely had more to them than black & white monster makeup and fire breathing/blood spitting stage theatrics. Becoming something of a celebrity type by this time,what with dating Cher and all Gene Simmons album even in terms of the Kiss solo projects isn't what a lot of people might expect.<br /><br />  Honestly? It's pretty darn good. I'm very picky when it comes to hard guitar rock,preferring rhythm,melody and songcraft over noisiness. And if you like that sort of pop/rock with an appealing edge here and there,this might work very well for you. Opening with,as you'll hear at the beginning of some of these tracks with a rather lofty orchestral fanfare. Featuring musicians such as Jeff Skunk Baxter,Rick Nelson,Bob Seger,Joe Perry and backup vocals from Donna Summer,Helen Reddy and Janis Ian Gene showcases that outside all the theatrics he's a pop artist underneath it all. Songs such as \\"Radioactive\\",\\"Always Near You/Nowhere To Hide\\",\\"See You Tonight\\" and especially the catchy \\"Mr.Make Believe\\" don't sound much like Kiss but are excellent late 70's pop/rock numbers with a more rhythmic touch. Even the rockier songs such as \\"Burning Up With Fever\\",\\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"Livin' In Sin\\" have far more of a bluesy hard rock crunch to them than any kind of speedy metal overkill. I am still not sure what to think of \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\". It's just somewhat awkward,especially the manner in which Gene sings it-especially the lower parts. But that doesn't keep this from otherwise being a great album.<br /><br />  It was probably extremely good of Kiss to record these albums when they did,the way they did. Now that I think about it,this wouldn't have been a bad way for a lot of classic rock bands to have done things. Imagine if The Beatles had all released solo albums the same day in  say...1970. Or the Rolling Stones in...1975. Or The Clash in 1984. This probably wouldn't be a workable concept in other genres the way it would for rock because bands in other genres such as jazz and soul tend to come into their music more fully formed and ready for a unified statement. It would seem most rock stars in bands are pretty much gunning for their ego half the time anyway-already solo artists in their minds before they leave a group. And the fact the members of Kiss admitted their rock star egos needed to be stretched and released these albums probably explains how they stayed together longer than a lot of other rock bands. They found a way to deal with their separate creative personalities in a diplomatic way. And were able to come back to the band with a new take on music in general.

0131103628|1.0|I am honestly surprised that so many people have given this book 5 stars. Being a student at a University learning the 101 of C, I have to admit that this book is difficult and tedious to go through. There just isn't enough detail and explanation in an easy to understand format. It takes you right into typing \\"Hello, World\\" and then rapidly into functions, while using programming vocabulary that in no way a beginner could follow. It talks about the \\"C compiler\\" like you're supposed to know what it is and what it does without an explanation. Not to mention the lack of variability in the code. Each section demonstrates the author's version of the code when trying to solve a particular problem, but realistically this stunts the learning curve. Logically there are many different ways to write the same program and the way the author has done it is not necessarily the best in my honest opinion.**  I can't recommend another book to anyone because honestly I don't know which textbook out there is the best to learn for beginners. Seems like most people who have regarded K&Ms book so highly are those who have already taken a course or two, or even three in C programming.   For people taking CS 100, 101, 104... whatever your college or school calls it, try to ask people around for REAL recommendations. DO NOT BUY this book unless you are confident you have some background in basic programming.  **I had a friend sit down with me and help me write a very similar program to the celsius-fahrenheit one, and honestly he used if-statements instead of having an upper, lower, step method. It looked much simpler and easier to follow than this (IMO). He even explained to me each syntax and what each command did, which is something this book did not care to elaborate on. Just another reason I know it wasn't meant for the beginner.
B005POK858|4.0|This is a superb game similar to games such as Dragon Warrior and Dragon Quest for Gameboy and DS. Not as robust as a mobile console game, but definitely lots of quality gaming that I can take seriously.
B0041KKYGA|1.0|I expected \\"Anonymous\\" to anger me; I did not expect it to bore me.  It starts out with a lie, when Derek Jacobi says that Shakespeare's daughter's were \\"irrefutably illiterate.\\"  One (Susanna) signed her name.  How does that equal \\"irrefutably illiterate\\"?  It has numerous historical inaccuracies.  But the worst part is that it is deadly dull.  Rhys Ifans plays de Vere as a man who keeps everything so bottled up, he seems to be suffering from constant constipation.  For a man who (according to the Oxfordians) wrote so many comedies, it is odd that he never once demonstrates a sense of humor.  He doesn't seem to enjoy ANYTHING.  Why are his plays so full of life when he is not?  And setting aside the ludicrous conspiracy/authorship theories, the film makes no sense on its own terms.  Supposedly Oxford first learns that plays have the power to move people when, as an adult, he attends one of Ben Jonson's plays.  But according to \\"Anonymous,\\" de Vere has been writing plays like \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" and had them performed at court for years.  That never gave him the idea that plays could move people?  And de Vere says that plays without politics are mere decoration, but he doesn't seem to have ANY political beliefs himself, except for a grudge against his adoptive relatives.  This is a truly awful film.

0525423656|4.0|Cassia gets herself assigned to the Outer Provinces in search of Ky, who lives each day as a target for the Enemy. When Ky finally escapes with two other boys, his first plan is to find his way back to Cassia. Both face a long journey of hardships, death, and betrayal.<br /><br />Cassia has made her choice with Ky, but Xander still holds a place in heart. And she's still a bit naïve. While the previous story was entirely in the heart of the Society, this sequel follows Cassia and Ky on their separate paths on the outside. And as Matched focused mostly on Cassia, Crossed gives equal time to Cassia and Ky. And readers receive more insight into Ky and his tortured past.<br /><br />This second book in the Matched trilogy has a different feel from the first, maybe because of the setting and already knowing about the regulated Society. Matched was about Cassia making a choice between the Society (Xander) and freedom (Ky). Crossed also is about making choices for both Cassia and Ky, involving both of their futures. Just as gripping and engaging as before, fans will not be disappointed. Though, the story does end abruptly with a bit of confusion. Full of adventure, mystery, and intrigue - readers of all ages will enjoy this highly entertaining dystopian trilogy. Condie's near-future world is thrilling and completely engaging.
B005LFS43O|4.0|James Blake seemingly came out of nowhere in 2010 with a couple of vinyl EP releases that quickly created a sizable buzz and eventually lead to the release of his debut album earlier this year. Now only 6 months later already comes a new release.<br /><br />\\"Enough Thunder\\" (6 tracks; 26 min.) continues the electronic minimalist sound of earlier releases, and to great effect. The opening track \\"Once We All Agree\\" is the first of several piano-based tracks on here (albeit with plenty other stranger sounds). \\"We Might Feel Unsound\\" is probably my favorite track on here, entirely electronic, and with interesting underlying pulses. \\"Fall Creek Buys Choir\\" is a new track co-written and co-performed with Justin Vernin (a/k/a Bon Iver), and I'm quite sure you've never heard Bon Iver like this, it's yet miles further away than their recent self-titled is from \\"For Emma\\"). As is the custom for James Blake, he includes a cover on this release as well, namely Joni Mitchell's \\"A Case Of You\\" (from her \\"Blue\\" album\\"), but Blake transposes the singer/guitar setting to a singer/piano setting. Other than changing it from guitar to piano, it is a surprisingly straight take on the song, and not my favorite moment on this release (this track was originally recorded for a BBC 1 show earlier this year). \\"Not Long Now\\" is probably the most \\"traditional\\", as in: electronic/chill sounding track on here. This release concludes with the title track, and again is just Blake and his piano.<br /><br />In all, I quite like this release (don't call it an \\"EP\\", as it's only 12 min. shorter than the album released earlier this year, how about a \\"mini-album?), even though it is not quite as strong as the debut album, which surely will end up high on my \\"Albums of the Year\\" list. Blake has done some sporadic touring of the US this year, but unfortunately I did not get a chance to see him live. Can't wait for that opportunity at some point. Meanwhile \\"Enough Thunder\\" is a good addition to/companion to the stellar debut album from earlier this year. Looking forward to what James Blake will bring us next.lbum from earlier this year. Looking forward to what James Blake will bring us next.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Earlier this morning I read the not-so-good reviews on this cover, so I was a bit skeptical.  Right away after putting it on my Kindle Fire I knew this COVER WAS A KEEPER.  What's to like?  NICE AND SNUG - fits like a glove.  I'm a frequent traveler, so I will be using it to prop up the Kindle Fire for movies.  It worked well for this - only watched a few minutes, but I liked what it did.  STAYS CLOSED when you want - I like the elastic strap that secures the whole unit.  Seeing that they lowered the price today is an added bonus.  WEIGHS NEXT TO NOTHING - I like my electronics to weigh as little as possible since I'm always toting them with me.  If you think you will be dropping your Kindle Fire, then this is probably not for you.  IF you are like me and want a cover that has a low profile, weighs very little, protects the screen and can be used to prop up the Kindle Fire to watch movies then this is a great option.
1451648537|2.0|The book in general was a let down.  It covers interesting tidbits about his family life and diet.  That said the he often got major points wrong about Apple software and hardware history.  Basically the authors doesn't know a dam thing about windows or mac's.  John Siracusa has given an excellent breakdown of the book and closes with the fitting statement Jobs picked the wrong guy.
B0063ONP36|5.0|I really enjoyed The Mentalists. It had a lot of old-school elements of Supernatural that long term fans would recognise; ghosts, grave digging, salting and burning, the EMF meter, grisly deaths. It also had a lot of heart as through their investigation of the case Dean and Sam sorted through some of their own issue.  An excellent episode continuing the brilliant run of eps so far in season 7.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I received both my Kindle Fire and this cover an hour ago.  The first thing that I did was to put Fire inside the cover.  I haven't worked with the Fire yet, but the case is great. I am a little surprised by some of the low reviews for this product.  It looks great, it's light, and it becomes a stand as described in the product features.<br /><br />BTW, I pre-ordered it at $39 a few days ago, but I saw that the price was dropped to $29. I just called Amazon's customer service and they refunded me for the difference.  Overall, I am very happy with this case.<br /><br />Now it's time to play with Fire! ;=)
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Just put my kindle fire in the case and everything feels fine. I don't know where people are getting the whole \\"glue\\" thing from. I have yet to see anything glued to the case. Overall the back is solid, the cover does fold(although i will say its best for tables, counters, desks..not so much soft surfaces like beds or laps because it will fall back into place)..but again i have had no problems with the case, i ordered the white one and it looks great and doesn't add any extra weight to the tablet. ive noticed some people complaining about light and cheap the cover feels, i guess it just depends on your preference. I preferred something that wouldn't weigh my kindle fire down and looked rather nice, so this cover works for me.
B005I6EU7U|2.0|First off: the cover is beautiful.  However, the only thing that makes this \\"made for the Kindle Fire\\" is the label.  Just like an earlier reviewer wrote, the Fire barely fits into the elastic straps inside the cover, and the cover doesn't lay flat.  An owner of the new Fire is better off reusing the case for their Kindle 3 (if you have one; I had a M-Edge zipped case on mine) until better \\"book-like\\" cases come on the market.  Since I'm looking for something long term to replace this cover (I'm returning this), based on the reviews I've seen this evening, it seems that the best possible option may be the \\"Splash SIGNATURE Folio Leather Case Cover Compatible with Amazon Kindle FIRE\\".

0345347951|4.0|What started off as a rather traditional SF piece turned into a highly unpredictable and impossible to put down read. I have not encountered ideas explored in Childhood's End in any other books. Even considering the fact that the book was written almost 60 years ago, it reads very fresh and engaging. Definitely a must read.
0143038419|4.0|While beautifully written, Eat Pray Love is probably one of the most overrated books, in my opinion. While it's got some wonderfully bright moments and Gilbert's plight is extremely relatable for women, I think it's cliché and her experiences are not groundbreaking--if there wasn't so much hype about this book, I would have thought it was a nice read with some interesting descriptions of travel abroad. At times, I felt that the author was wallowing in despair and I couldn't feel sorry for her situation--so it's time for a divorce and you don't know who you are yet? Her glamorized rite of passage is one many young adults experience right after college--it's called backpacking abroad.  The descriptions are beautiful and make the book worth reading--but I definitely felt like it went on and on and was about 100 pages too long. I like the element of self-discovery and Gilbert is a very talented writer, but I guess I just expected the story to be more compelling.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's a blast. The game play is intuitive and addictive, I just can't get enough. I will see it again and again.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|There is no doubt that on first listen, this piece appears dark, dull and unappealing.  However, like many substantial works of art, continued study (it's been a couple weeks now) reveals a deep, detailed piece of work.<br /><br />Many multi-faceted music projects have this characteristic - consider Le Sacre du Printemps, any Beethoven Symphony, Tommy, The Wall, Electric Ladyland.  One may find some instantly gratifying parts, but further study reveals layers and details that were not apparent on the first few listens.  Lulu may not have any hot licks that jump out in front of the darkness, but the details - be it beautiful guitar layers or the interleaved vocals presents a beautiful piece of work.<br /><br />TomC<br />Detroit, Michigan, USA
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|*** How to get the digital copy of the movie to work on iTunes from ultraviolet***    I just wanted to share with everyone my outstanding experience with ultraviolet customer service, in resolving the issue of not being able to access the movie on iTunes.    After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was going to return the movie as I specifically wanted the Blu Ray and a digital copy to play on my iPad and iPhone.    After receiving the disc, I read the print on the back of the packaging and noticed a website address for the ultraviolet service: [...]  I contacted their customer service department and advised them that i was disappointed that the disc will not work on iTunes.  I was not really expecting a response back and was amazed, as their Customer Service department contacted me almost immediately and requested that I provide them with the Reference Code (to verify my purchase of the movie) and they would send me an activation code which will allow me to redeem an electronic version of the movie on iTunes.    I sent them the code and they responded almost immediately with a reference code.  I entered the code on iTunes and was able to redeem the movie on iTunes and watch it on my iPad.    I hope that this information is useful to other buyers of the movie.
1451648537|4.0|The book itself is written in a way that makes it feel almost like a compilation of notes describe Jobs, his life, friends and family. At times it'll jump to future details or relate to information previously gone over to connect ideas, and make assumptions about him. Overall I'm enjoying this book ~ More then halfway done it and its proving to be an entertaining read with inspiring bits, horrible truths, but very real, very entertaining life experiences of Steve Jobs. I would really like to know what Steve would have thought about this book.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|If you've never owned \\"Evil Dead II\\" before, or if you've owned it a million times already across VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, VCD, DVD, and Blu-ray, the new 25th Anniversary Edition by Lionsgate is THE version to have.  Lionsgate apparently returned to the original camera negative for this new transfer, and it shows. Detail is far above and beyond every previous home video release, including the dreaded waxed-over Blu-ray from Anchor Bay. A strong grain structure is present, although some mild DVNR tampering is visible--the grain generally moves as grain ought to, although sometimes it becomes more static, but never at a standstill. Color grading is a lot more dynamic and pleasing with realistic flesh tones and beautiful lighting I swear I've never quite seen before, while the contrast is more stable with night scenes looking appropriately dark, while daytime and near-dusk scenes look more appropriate and fitting than ever before. Black levels are solid, although there have been concerns of black crush being involved--that is, when shadow detail is lost, the shading variances gone and blacks being \\"crushed\\" instead. This doesn't appear to be any defect of the mastering, however; the film has always been dark, and it's my belief that the stark, detail-free blacks are due to underexposure during filming. The '98 VHS tape, THX- and DiviMax-mastered DVDs, and original Blu-ray (all from Anchor Bay) that I own all feature the same \\"problem\\" (*); I believe it was an artistic decision and one that I find to be visually striking. To top it all off, the original age restriction warning before the Rosebud logo returns, which had been excised from Anchor Bay's Blu-ray.  *(This is not to say that old home video releases are correct and that they should be used as a guideline for how the film should look; old video masters should never be the standard of quality in any respect since they are often very inaccurate to the original film source. I'm simply saying that I doubt very muchthat ALL of these previous video masters would be so goofed up as to feature the exact same levels of black crush as featured on the Lionsgate Blu-ray, so it is almost definitely part of the original photography. The DiviMax/Book of the Dead DVD and Anchor Bay Blu-ray, by the way, are transferred from the same master.)  Full-res screenshots of the title can be viewed at caps-a-holic, which also compares this release to the Anchor Bay one.  Some may be upset to hear that the wires used to hold up the flying eyeball have been digitally removed. This doesn't bother me since they were never meant to be seen in the first place, but there is a quaintness that is now missing with their removal; far as I can tell, the rest of the wires remain intact, which is odd that they'd only fix the one. If only they'd gone all-out and fixed all the wires, the huge tear in Ted Raimi/Possessed Henrietta's rear, and fixed the shots where unfinished sets are seen. Hey, if you're going to fix one thing, why not fix it all à la \\"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\\"? It should be all or nothing; fix it all or leave it well enough alone.  The only audio provided is a DTS-HD 5.1 track with English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles optional. An uncompressed original mono track would have been appreciated (coded as 2.0 dual mono); I've never been too wild over surround re-mixes, especially since only the original mix represents the intentions of the filmmakers. But, the 5.1 mix does the job well enough.  Extras include an all-new 100-minute documentary titled \\"Swallowed Souls: The Making of Evil Dead II\\", split up into several chapters and featuring endearing new stop-motion effects recreating scenes from the film (a whole full-length recreation of the film in this fashion would be a load of fun to see). The doc is fun and informative with a lot of new trivia that I'd never heard before, such as the existence of co-writer Scott Spiegel's short film \\"Attack of the Helping Hand\\" and its influence on the \\"Evil Dead II\\" script. A 30-minute behind-the-scenes production video is also provided, showing off among other things scenes which were deleted during the editing process which all have plenty of fascinating effects, and it's unfortunate that these scenes were not found and restored for this Blu-ray release as separate deleted scenes. A 7-minute return to the shooting locations is also new, and the standard definition \\"The Gore the Merrier\\" and Tom Sullivan photo commentary featurettes from the Anchor Bay DVDs are provided as well. The movie commentary is the same entertaining one which has been around since I believe one of the LaserDisc releases. The US trailer is thankfully presented in HD, and there are HD photo galleries as well.  \\"Evil Dead II\\", the fantastic sequel to the low-budget, DIY \\"The Evil Dead\\" (it's NOT a remake; the first seven minutes merely recap the first movie since rights to the footage could not be acquired), has never looked this pretty and detailed on home video, and is DEFINITELY worth the upgrade. (The THX-mastered DVD from 2000 can finally be retired.) Strangely, the restoration and transfer is not of the same caliber as Bob Murawski and Anchor Bay's work on the first film, so it's unfortunate that Lionsgate did not throw at the project quite the same amount of money and talent as the first film's HD restoration received, but it's an impressive transfer nonetheless, and the film has certainly never looked this good beyond its original theatrical exhibition. HIGHLY recommended for fans of this insane splatter comedy masterpiece and for newcomers as well. Sadly, the disc is Region A-locked. Sorry, overseas fans; hopefully you'll see this transfer released in your area before long.  Now if only \\"Army of Darkness\\" (both theatrical and director's cuts) would receive a Blu-ray release that doesn't look like sun-baked vomit. At least the NTSC Region 3 DVD put out by MGM exists.

0553801473|2.0|I'm not going to go off on a 500 word essay on this book. I'll sum it up, nothing really happens 1100 pages could have been 400 pages of exciting story.  No real plot lines get worked out.  Few questions answered, many more left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  I waited 5 years for this?  Now how long will we have to wait, I don't think GRRM has any idea how to get this (what appears to be) out of control story back in line.<br /><br />It's classic Jordan, the story has gotten bigger than the Author.  50/50 it ever gets finished before the fat bastard takes a dirt nap.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I really must be behind the times, because I had not a clue what fan fiction was all about. Honestly, that's probably a good thing because I probably would have never read this book...which, by the way was wonderful and fantastic and not at all what I would have expected from fan fiction. From the descriptions I have read, fanfic is not my kind of read. Actually, I am not certain I am clear on that genre, but I digress, that is a topic for another day...<br /><br />FIFTY SHADES OF GREY is dark and romantic, but don't expect roses and rainbows, because you will be really disappointed. Christian Grey is beautiful and wealthy and confidently in control, but that is all just a shiny veneer that protects the tortured soul that lives inside. All of Mr. Grey's carefully crafted control slowly begins to unravel once Anastasia Steel stumbles into his world.<br /><br />The interaction between Christian and Anastasia is lovely and romantic, but also maddening--at times driving me to the point of insanity. With enlightenment, Christian brings drama to Anastasia's existence. He opens the doors to a world that is so foreign to her that she has a tough time wrapping her mind around the concept of the relationship Christian wants to share with her. In a flash, she finds herself toggling between the life she once knew and the new life she is becoming acquainted with...a world filled with mystery, intrigue and darkness, a lot of darkness.<br /><br />I was very impressed with how E.L. James painted the picture of the uber dominant, Christian Grey. I could have very easily disliked his character, but there was something in her depiction of Mr. Grey that just hit all the right spots (and I do mean all) perfectly for me. Christian's character kept me a little off kilter. I loved how he could be brooding and scary then, the second I decided to hate him, he flipped the switch to Prince Charming mode and I wanted him to lay me out on the nearest piece of furniture and have his wicked way with me. I can't even imagine what it must be like for the very inexperienced Anastasia. Extremely disarming I am sure.<br /><br />I am intentionally steering clear of too much discussion about Ana's struggles with their relationship, for fear of revealing too much. Her emotions are a large part of what makes FIFTY SHADES OF GREY unique from all the other D/s stories that are on the shelves.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, it is beautifully written. FIFTY SHADES OF GREY has BDSM elements, but don't let that deter you from picking it up, it's mostly about domination and submission with a little spanking and flogging for good measure, but nothing too heavy. I think this book has the potential to appeal to the masses. GET IT. READ IT. You will love it!at it must be like for the very inexperienced Anastasia. Extremely disarming I am sure.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was really a feast for the mind. The way the author is able to use words - it was actually quite magical. I stumbled upon this book as part of Starbuck's \\"Free Download of the Week\\" or in this case - free partial download and I'm so pleased that I did. At times, I did find it somewhat hard to follow and to understand the timeline of when events were happening (e.g. sometimes you would span 3 years with a turn of a page but the story picks up like it happened yesterday). This book is worth a try...you won't be disappointed. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next....so good, that it's my first book review.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Lets face it here, its been years since we could say we have seen an amazing rock album. The fact that the Foo Fighters decided to cut the computer stuff and the fancy recording equipment and use an old recording system just makes this album even more special. It was all recorded in Dave's garage in his house. I guess the term garage band still applies to the Foos. As for the songs... You put the CD in your player and you think alright it should be a nice opening tune to kind of set the mood... Well, clearly the mood is high paced rock n roll. Bride Burning is probably one of the best opening songs to an album I have heard in a very long time. Just the fact you get Grohl's trademark scream right at the beginning of the song makes you realize this album is not going to mess around. After that you get to \\"Rope\\" which is the single released before the album's release. I like the song its got the usual Foo to it and one of the only songs of the past few years with a drum solo in the middle of it. The guitar work on it is fantastic and catchy during the refrain. Although i must say the refrain to Rope kind of sounds like a song from Rush...    The next song is \\"Dear Rosemary\\" starting Bob Mould from the band Sugar. Its a great song with great lyrics and again more good guitar work. Then comes the Rage against the machine type song \\"White Limo\\". Using a special effect through his microphone Grohl makes the song stand out with a great sounding voice in the song with a really cool riff in the beginning. After that comes probably their most popular song on the record \\"Alandria\\". Known as one of the catchiest songs on the record the song consists of again that typical Foo sound that we all have come to know and love. With catchy refrain lyrics this is a song you will probably listen to twice in a row.   After that comes the slower rock tune into the usual hard rock is \\"These Days\\". I just saw the Foo Fighters live at the Prudential Center on November 14th, and Grohl even saidthis is probably his favorite song his written lyric wise. The lyrics are, in my opinion, what make this song so incredible. After that comes \\"Back and Forth\\", \\"A Matter of Time\\". I believe those are 2 filler songs in my opinion. Back and forth is good, but it gets old half way through the song and you just want to skip to the next song which honestly isnt much better. A matter of time is a good song dont get me wrong, but its placed wrong on the album. Its right in the front of what i believe to be the best three songs on the record. \\"Miss the Misery\\" is my personal favorite on the album. With one of the best guitar riffs i think the foos have come up with since Everlong the song is just the heavy distortion and beats that we have all come to know and love from the Foos.  \\"I Should Have Known\\" comes out slowly with finger picking on the electric from Dave with some pretty powerful lyrics. But then you realize this song means business when you start to hear the Bass riff from the former bass player of Nirvana. With a stunning chord progression this song is the complete package because it has great lyrics and a great melody. The closing song to Wasting Light is \\"Walk\\". Not only is the song itself good but the video to this song is just plain funny. The video is a spoof off of the movie \\"Falling Down\\". But the lyrics to the song again mix well with the guitar work and the overall melody.   So overall this album is great. Sound mixing is perfect and the vocals are just getting better for Dave. After seeing them live for the first time I am a believe that this band is the real deal. Its taken them 16 years to become the band they are now today. They have come a long way from Dave playing all the instruments on their first album. But bringing Pat Smear back to this album gave it more live. Because every time Smear plugs in a guitar it just starts screaming, so adding that sound gave this album a definitive sound to it. And although Taylor Hawkins is no Grohl on the drums, he has really come a long way. He played really well on this album and showed off that he really is the real deal.(but he still wont ever be Grohl...) And Chris has now proven that he can be a shredder on guitar in every way, shape and form. So i would suggest if your not a Foo Fighters fan and you want to be, either pick up this album first or get Colour and the Shape. You wont be disappointed because the Foo Fighters are a shining example that Rock n Roll will still be around till the day they die.
B005PYZG6E|4.0|The product I received was exactly what I expected. A very simple, small device to help me keep my shots steady. It isn't that difficult to find the right balance - at least it wasn't for me - but it does get a bit heavy after a while which makes it harder to use for extended shots. Also, I wish it would've come with more instructions as to how to use it, since it only comes with instructions on how to assemble and balance it.<br /><br />Overall it is a good product for its price, and a good buy it you want to make your videos look more professional, but it is not the absolute best solution to avoid ugly shaking of your camera when recording. There are better steadicams out there, albeit bigger, more complicated and more expensive. This is a good starting point.

Not the typical treatment I've received fom Amazon.
B005UKJZ10|4.0|There are very few things that I say have to be watched in high definition, and this is definitely one of them.  The imagery is just breath-takingly gorgeous.  Even beyond the much talked about origins of life sequence, there are just so many subtle nuances and beautiful details that it must be watched in high definition, anything else is just short changing this piece of art.<br /><br />However, on the merits of the movie itself, I was less impressed.  It seems to me that it was created to be a \\"thinking movie\\", but it mostly fails in that regard by plodding development, a limited plot, and the aforementioned sequences that interrupt the flow of the movie.<br /><br />But since it is one of the most talked about movies of 2011, I think you owe it to yourself to watch it, if even just once, to see what everyone is talking about, and to truly feast on the eye and ear (a fantastic soundtrack accompanies this movie) candy presented.  Just plan on spending some time on it, and cutting out distractions.  It's a movie that will give back to you what you put into it, so give it your best shot possible.

0780747550|1.0|Honestly, I can not figure out how anyone can get through this miserable book.  The writing is one continuous run on sentence.  It simply rambles.  And it is the same story over and over again throughout the book.  Dad drinks, family has no money, and a child dies.  Turn page and repeat,repeat,repeat.  I read a ton of books, and can usually get through even the mediocre ones.  This one however will be a fail on my list.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|It's a fun little game, but it's shorter than I'd like.  Getting a perfect on each level doesn't do anything, other than give you a high score and the word perfect under the icon.  I was hoping for something, even a different colored background if nothing else.
0321704452|5.0|I truly appreciated what I learned from The Naked Presenter by Garr Reynolds. This book has provided many great insights of what I should and should not be doing in preparing for and presenting a presentation.  The book's message was clear that capturing the audience's interest and attention (engaging the audience) comes not from elaborate detailed power points or by reading a script on prepared notes or documents.  To engage means to be one with the audience in presence, eye contact and the words and volume that are spoken.  In presentation the speaker does not have any barrier between himself and the audience.  He must remove the lectern, move where he can be engaging to the audience, and have eye contact on the audience, not his power points.    The presenter must know his topic well, but not memorized, and provide his information so the audience can feel, relate, and visualize what is being presented.  The speaker's rate, volume and pitch can be varied so that it is not monotone or boring.  Because of the audience's attention span the speaker can work his presentation in segments of 10 minutes if the presentation is 30 minutes or longer. Stimuli can be introduced by adding relevant material that gives the brain a break and hooks each segment.  These links can be a story, video clips, or a case study.  The audience can also be asked to participate at one of these segments by asking rhetorical questions, form small groups to solve a problem, or other participation methods for engagement.  This is a must read book for all professionals wanting to provide a clear, engaging and relevant material to their audience.
B0041KXKU2|5.0|Love this movie! I was a Star Trek fan way back when I found it in reruns in the early 80's, and when I heard about this new Star Trek movie, I thought no way I would like it, especially considering the low quality of earlier movies, but wow...this one is good.  Especially like the new Spock.

Found a much nicer one for less money.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Oliver Tate is a somewhat maudlin, not-so-nice young man in his middle teens who finds himself wrestling with adult experiences for the first time in this well-written, sensitively directed first film from Richard Ayoade (The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh).<br /><br />He has fallen in love with Jordana Bevan, a classmate whose haircut and appearance reminded me very much of the great silent film femme fatale Louise Brooks.  Jordana herself is not so pleasant, she's a rather remote young lady who is not above bullying her less fortunate classmates.  Oliver, however, is smitten, and sets about trying to win her love.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Oliver's parents seem to be slowly drifting apart: his father suffers from bouts of depression and his mother is becoming way too close to an old beau, a new age guru, for Oliver's comfort.  Oliver can see his family on the verge of falling apart and it drives him to desperate acts.<br /><br />These characters struggle through their lives against a gloomy Welsh seaside background that is a perfect reflection of their moods.  None of these people is from Sunnybrook Farm, they definitely have theiri all to human flaws.  But they also have a strange beauty and the story resonates wonderfully as an authentic piece of the human experience.<br /><br />Well done.

B005J29HCQ|4.0|The release of the long-shelved \\"Smile\\" sessions is truly a cause for celebration and relegates the 2004 'recreation; as a no-longer needed substitute for this, as close to the real thing as we will ever get.    One many argue about some of the Van Park's lyrics (which run from sublime to juvenile), but you can't debate the majesty and originality of the compositions and productions. Without listening to the 'extra tracks,' this release finally provides an understanding of Wilson's conception of Smile as a \\"teenage symphony\\" and cements his reputation as a 'sound shaper' par excellence. While clearly some of the compositions do sound drug-inspired, particularly the many variations on \\"Heroes and Villains,\\"  the sheer musicality of the songs is unparelleled with anything Wilson (or nearly anyone else) created before or since. It is about as close as one can get to \\"listening to a composer's imagination,\\" as the sheer wealth of musical ideas and arrangements pour forth like a gusher. That Wilson is able to muster his group of musicians to put his vision on tape in a coherent manner is a testament to his mastery as both a songwriter and producer.   If you need evidence of this, just listen to the second disk, which is primarily a series of different takes of various pieces of different songs. Wilson is constantly experimenting, rearranging, reconfiguring, but in a way that suggests that he knows exactly how he wants the music to sound and is struggling to coerce his often skeptical group of musicians to play these sounds. The legends claim that he may have been going through a nervous breakdown at this time, but you can't tell listening to these tracks. Here, Wilson is in total control, forceful yet patient, displaying as deep of an understanding of orchestration and sound design as his contemporary composer-producer-orchestrator peer, Frank Zappa, did with the Mothers (arguably, Wilson may have been influenced by the early Mothers albums, particularly in the rather suggestive 'heavy breathing' sections of one of the Heroes and Villains variations)    Given the number of takes and variations, and the sheer enormity of having to go through all of these recorded sections to assemble coherent songs, and then somehow try to figure out how to put it all together in a sequence that made some kind of sense, it's no wonder that Wilson decided to shelve the whole thing; it's the musical equivalent of creating all the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle without knowing how they'll all fit together.   Fortunately, the 2004 re-creation forced Wilson to reconsider his material and finally figure out how it would work together. This template become the sequence for the original tracks, and it works superbly. You have to compare the two versions to fully appreciate how Wilson used the Boys not as vocalists but as musical instruments. It's quite doubtful whether the other Boys had any understanding of the words they were singing, but their complete faith in Wilson's musical vision (which paid off in spades when they overcome their resistance to participating in Pet Sounds, which yielded several hits) is evident in every harmony. As he did in Pet Sounds, Wilson has gone far beyond surf music here, and the results he achieves here, given the state of recording technology in 1967, are astounding.  And this release does the music justice. The re-mastering is absolutely superb.  Would the release of Smile in this sequence in 1967 have become as influential as Sergeant Pepper and the other psychedelic classics of that year? That's debatable. So much of it is rooted in complex classical and musical theater traditions, rather than the three-chord guitar/drums/bass conventions of rock and roll, that it might have bombed in the same way that Phil Spector's bombastic collaborations with Tina Turner also bombed. We'll never really know. For now, however, this edition of Smile stands at a belated testament to Brian Wilson's grandiose ambitions, and one that should finally cement his reputation as one of rock's most inspired musical visionaries.

0385534639|4.0|This one has been a breakout hit.  Here's why:<br /><br />1.  Beautiful presentation - the dustcover is colorful, with lovely graphic elements - the actual binding is bookshelf-worthy as well, with shiny silver text on black - the inside pages have lovely starry insets between pages as well as graphic pages with \\"quotes\\" from various people on Le Cirque des Reves - just a gorgeous-LOOKING book<br /><br />2.  Imaginative and fanciful - I was most impressed by the originality of the story - it's difficult to find a story that feels wholly original, but this one fits the bill.<br /><br />3.  Writing - the writing is totally spot-on - you can feel the magic coming out of the pages with very descriptive and evocative prose<br /><br />The characters - there's the requisite bad guy in the form of Celia's father, who gets his own comeuppance when a trick he tries goes too far.  Although I enjoyed the STORY, I really never felt a connection with many of the characters - there's a romance that seems to fall flat on the pages, and the motivations of many characters are unclear.  I felt like an impartial observer of these lives and I actually felt more for some of the secondary characters than any of the main ones.<br /><br />Even so, the \\"feel\\" of this novel makes it worth reading - it actually may even make a good re-read, as some of the nuances missed on the first read may become clearer on the second.  The descriptive settings, the imaginative circus that only opens at night (and no one knows ahead of time where it will be), with its magical displays and unparalleled performers, as well as the concept behind its formation - only a wonderfully creative mind could have come up with this.  Some may not care for the somewhat circular fashion that the story is told in, but I felt that it was perfect for this type of fantasy read.<br /><br />Writing:  5 out of 5 stars<br />Plot:  5 out of 5 stars<br />Characters: 3 out of 5 stars<br />Reading Immersion:  4 out 5 stars<br /><br />BOOK RATING:  4.25 out of 5 stars<br /><br />SENSITIVE READER:  There are a couple of \\"iffy\\" spots - one or two curse words and an implied sexual scene, but, really, I don't think that it will offend almost anyone.spots - one or two curse words and an implied sexual scene, but, really, I don't think that it will offend almost anyone.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It was my third month in the USA and one day I felt myself so depressed and lonely, thus I thought I had to buy a book. I went out but every where was closed except for a common supermarket. Although I had bias about not buying a book from a supermarket, I did buy 'Sarah's Key' and it taught me a lot! De Rosnay depicts the events so vividly and gives also a strong historical background that you cannot give up reading the book until you reach to the end. The book touches the heart. I felt so sorry for those people who lost their hopes and lives during those unhappy events in the World War Two. I knew that there were many countries involved in this Jewish Holocaust but I did not know that something happened in France. I strongly recommend you to read this book. You will not only learn the history but also read a well-organized story. Thanks to Tatiana de Rosnay!
0807014273|5.0|Very quick trade.This book gives great insight to a great man.His time in a concentration camp is recalled in a raw and honest way.Yet it stands apart from other suchlike books, as his message is about humanity, and the ability to forgive.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|I really looked forward to watching this film and had really high hopes.  The cast for this movie was insane.  I felt as though it could have been better than what it was, but I still enjoyed it.  I would recommend to anyone looking to have a few laughs.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought this headset for gaming while chatting on ventrillo. I cannot believe it's only $25. The overall quality is outstanding. I would have paid $50+ with no complaints.  Pros   - Great sound quality for games, music, and chatting. It's almost too good, now I can hear people eating and typing while on vent :p  - The headset is comfortable.  - Materials are firm and not \\"cheap\\" feeling.  - Microphone isn't intrusive and people hear me clearly on vent.  - Price!  Cons  - I cannot hear my wife hollering at me while gaming. Not sure if that's a pro or con :)    - It's pretty big, which doesn't bother me.  Overall if you are looking for a high quality gaming headset with a low price, look no further.  You have found it!
B002ZG999U|4.0|I've wanted to see this movie for sometime now but never got around to watching it.  I was pleasantly surprised with this film overall.  I expected a weak story line with a lot of action, but what I got was a really good action film with ok plot.  There was a lot of cheesy lines and terrible acting by Randy Couture.  I also felt that some of the special effects looked terribly fake.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and would recognized it to anyone who is just looking for a movie that is non-stop action.
0062060554|4.0|How do you advance the plot of a suspense novel whose protagonist wakes up every morning with no memory? Surely Mr. Watson struggled with this as he was conceiving \\"Before I Go to Sleep.\\" It's a terrific IDEA, but when the events of the previous chapter are gone and must be restated at the beginning of every new chapter, so that the heroine will not be lost, the writer has to come up with some way to catch her up without this \\"reviewing\\" becoming tedious. And this, I'm afraid, is the real problem with the novel. Mr. Watson's solution is a journal, kept by the amnesiac main character and implausibly hidden by her every night, to be \\"found\\" the next day, but only after her therapist calls her on the phone and reminds her of its location. She reads (or re-reads) the journal every morning and thus is up to speed for the events of the current chapter. Except the therapist is written as a distant professional, even a suspicious character, not as someone who has bonded with his patient in a way that makes this daily call believable. This is a hard one to get past, folks, since it must be the start of every new chapter, but if you CAN get past it, the novel is pretty good. The writing is fine and the suspense does build to what turns out to be a believable (read \\"not supernatural\\") climactic explanation and a satisfying ending. With a different ending, it's a three star review.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book series when it was on sale.  I never read any of the previews so I had no Idea what I was getting into.  I feel as though this is the start of something great.  It had the element of suspense, action and love.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to embark on a new adventure.  This was one of those books that was impossible to put down.
B005KDWUFA|2.0|I have been a great fan of Il Divo since I first heard them many years ago.  I have all of their CD's - for my home and both cars.  They are my favorite group and when I saw them in Vegas their  superiority in the music field was evident by the audience who went \\"crazy\\" - from teenagers to seniors - during their performance. I personally have introduced about 20 people as to who they are and how much I love them.    That being said, I am greatly disappointed in this last CD.  It sounds as though it was recorded during a live concert somewhere instead of in a studio ...  was it???  I usually buy several copies for family and friends but not this time.  The music is so overpowering that at times I can hear no one but Carlos, which is ok, as he is my favorite but  I feel the choice of songs could have been much better.  Get Simon involved again. He knows what goes over better than most.  I am sure many will disagree with me but I am going to play this CD only in the home as my  CD player plays at random and I won't be overcome by the heaviness of listening to the whole CD at one time.  I am going back to Siempre for the cars.  I feel that is one of their best.  Sorry.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|Forget trying to get your iPhone 4S into this thing if you're in a hurry and when you do finally get it into the bracket, it's bent and on the verge of breaking.  It's like trying to pry open your dogs mouth when you're dog says \\"no way\\" ... it's really hard to do.  To make matters worse ... it's really cheap plastic and probably not going to last.  So I'm back to the drawing board in looking for a tripod mount for my, in a case, iPhone 4S.  I'd be happy to pay more money for a product that will hold my iPhone and mount to a tripod, I wasn't looking for a cheap mount ... it was just the only one I could find that claimed to be able to fit my phone ... NOT!
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I bought the full version and it worked fine.  I upgraded and lot the functionality of the full version.  Per DataViz, I installed both app and key , then reinstalled both app and key.  I have still not regained full functionality of app.  I will purchase another competing product.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|If you are a fan of musicals, I highly recommend \\"Burlesque\\".  I enjoyed the movie so much I just had to get the CD so I could enjoy the music away from home.  I was not previously a Cher or Christina Aquilera fan (didn't know much about Christina Aquilera).  They were both terrific in the movie.  I am a huge Cher fan now!  I really like Aquilera in the movie but I don't like her other music.  I checked out her CDs on Amazon and just couldn't get into her type of music.  I think she worked well for the movie but someone else was directing the song selections/types.  The songs she wrote for the movie are great!  She has a great voice but just chooses music for herself that isn't my type of music, other than for \\"Burlesque\\", of course.
B005POK858|1.0|This game is lacking in almost all areas.  The animae sequences are cool, but gameplay is terrible.  Gurk is a much better game.
0307891372|5.0|Skyrim is pretty much my first RPG so I wanted to pick up the guide to refer to if I got stuck. If you're having trouble deciding which race to pick, which skills to develop, or which magic to concentrate on, this guide gives an overview of everything to help build your character. So far that's how this guide has helped me the most - developing my character.  The first 100 or so pages explain the basics - characters, skills, perks, training, items, etc. The next 300 pages are basically a walkthrough of every main quest, side quest, and other quest. I love being able to play the game and follow along in the guide then check the box once I complete a quest. The last 300 pages give an overview of every location, including maps of dungeons and caves and what you find at each of these locations. It's handy being able to have this open instead of constantly pressing buttons to check the in-game map. Finally, there is a big fold out map that you can tear out of the book. It's far more detailed than the map in the game and a lot nicer to look at.  If you like the idea of having a book filled with pretty much everything you need to know about Skyrim, then this guide is perfect to have right next to you to refer to at any moment. Enjoy!
1595825045|5.0|This hardback covers the entire series in great detail, and takes the reader behind the scenes. Want to know how they came up with the costume designs for Long Feng, the evolution of Jet's gang, and archiecture influences?  There's a page for that.  Along with the history lessons, there are high-quality illustrations that make stellar references for anyone who wishes to sew the costumes. This was my primary motivation for buying the book, and it hasn't disappointed.
B005DOKK7Q|1.0|WOW.  This cover cost me $30 and looks/feels like it's worth about 25 cents. It only unzips on two sides, so its only functionality is flimsy protection when you aren't using the Kindle.  It looks so cheap; I feel ripped off and will return this immediately.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I am in complete agreement with all the other reviewers who rated the WB release of this \\"Ultra Violet\\" version with one or two stars.  The film is great however, this release is inferior The \\"Ultra Violet\\" does not work and the regular DVD copy does not have a chapter menu/index.  Your only choice is to play the entire feature and skip through the scenes manually. The blu-ray copy does not work in any of my players so I feel like I received less product for more money.  I will likely reaturn this for a regular DVD version only.
B005POK858|3.0|This could be a fun game but the sound.. Dies and any attempt to adjust the volume restarts/reboots my phone. Every time
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Love the conclusion to this epic journey. Kind of sorry for people that write off this series as only being a kids series or genre fare. They are truly missing out.   On the technical side of things- the bluray looks fantastic- the features are sparing but I'm sure that will be fixed down the road.   Very happy that the digital copy is UV. I never used any digital copies til I got remote access to the films with Disney Online and now Ultra Violet. If I'm stuck somewhere I love being able to get to movies on my phone and laptop.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I like this workout DVD a lot.  It's quick paced and makes you work hard in a short amount of time.  Always leaves me sweating, even  after mastering all 3 levels. I've done it enough, that some levels are memorized, so I move on to the exercise before Jillian and get more reps in than Jillian.  I like to use it as a supplement (or change of pace) to my regular workout or on the mornings I don't have a lot of time.  Plus, Jillian's comments are matter-of-fact with little opinion. They are encouraging without being annoying.

0143037757|5.0|I've read Pulitzer Prize winning books and this one equals them. The history is told in an easily readable style that makes a multi-dimensional world into a story you can understand. Judt provides statistics, discusses how common people were impacted by events, explains how political theories bent in the face of reality, and how the same action in two countries turned out differently. The simple two-dimensional world that we were taught in school turns out to be far different once you set aside political rhetoric. The one star reviews are based on a few errors but mostly because someone's political view got bruised.   Here are some excerpts to illustrate points that I've made and so you can read Judt's words for yourself and see if you are interested in reading the whole book.  P.4 \\"The little countries that emerged from the collapse of the old land empires in 1918 were poor, unstable, insecure- and resentful of their neighbors. Between the wars Europe was full of 'revisionist' states: Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria had all been defeated in the Great War and awaited an occasion for territorial redress.\\"  P.5 \\"In the light of what had gone before it is thus understandably tempting to narrate the story of Europe's unexpected recovery after 1945 in a self-congratulatory....'miracle'. Like many myths, this rather agreeable account...contains a kernel of truth. Its post war decades were peaceful, but only thanks to the uninvited presence of the Red Army.\\"  P.7 \\"In the first place, this is a history of Europe's reduction. The constituent states of Europe could no longer aspire, after 1945, to international or imperial status. Secondly, the later decades to the 20th century saw the withering away of the 'master narratives' of European history, with their models of progress and change, of revolution and transformation.\\"  P.9 \\"Thanks to war, occupation, boundary adjustments, expulsions and genocide, almost everybody now lived in their own country, among their own people. Only Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union stood aside.\\"  P.24 \\"What was taking place in 1945, and had been underway for at least a year was thus a unprecedented exercise in ethnic cleansing and population transfer. In part this was the outcome of 'voluntary' ethnic separation: Jewish survivors leaving a Poland where they were unsafe and unwanted or Italians departing the Istrian peninsula rather than live under Yugoslav rule. Many ethnic minorities who had collaborated with occupying forces (Italians in Yugoslavia, Hungarians in northern Transylvania returned to Romanian rule, Ukrainians in the western Soviet Union) fled with the retreating Wehrmacht to avoid retribution from the local majority or advancing Red Army, and never returned.\\"  P.25 \\"The Germans of eastern Europe would probably have fled west in any case; by 1945 they were not wanted in the countries where their families had been settled for man hundreds of years. Between a genuine popular desire to punish local Germans for the ravages of war and occupation, they were doomed and they knew it.\\"  Nobody gets a free pass. Everyone's actions positive or negative is analyzed.   P.151 \\"Stalin's support for Kim Il Sung's invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950 was his most serious miscalculation of all. The Americans and West Europeans immediately drew the (erroneous) conclusion that Korea was a diversion or prelude, and that Germany would be next. Stalin was contemplating a possible assault- on Yugoslavia, not West Germany- but abandoned the idea in the face of Western rearmament. And just as the West misread the Soviet purpose in Korea, so Stalin mistakenly assumed that the Americans had aggressive designs of their own on his sphere of control in eastern Europe. But none of these assumptions and miscalculations was clear at the time, and politicians and generals proceeded as best they could on the basis of limited information and past precedent.\\"  The details of activities in both Western and EasternEurope is really fascinating. The book includes some of the behind the scenes events immediately before, during, and after the coup against Gorbachev. And it takes you into the 1990s including the ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia and the continuing conflicts within Russia.  I've read whole books written on some the portions covered in this book. Judt's conclusions and fact-finding agree with those authors' research. So if you only have time for one comprehensive book, this is the one to read. I encourage you to read the one star reviews and associated comments for criticisms to the text.

1594744769|4.0|There are so many mixed reviews on this book I find it fascinating.  I was intrigued just by looking at the cover.  When I found out that the story was based on old vintage photographs I knew I had to get my hands on a copy. I guess there truly is a book for everyone because I loved this book. I loved how Riggs developed characters and a whole story around these fabulous vintage photos.<br /><br />When I first heard about this book I didn't know what to expect but this is pure fantastical fun. It reminds me a little of [[ASIN:B003YCQBRC Big Fish (movie tie-in): A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]. The way the story is spun and how no one really believes the grandfather's tales of adventure. I know a lot of people thought the photos were distracting to the telling of the book but I found they only added to it. The descriptions were so vivid they weren't even needed but I think they added something to it.  They were so weird you could easily see how someone could spin a story out of them.  This is a great diversion from the vampires, werewolves and witches that seem to be the main theme of YA lit these days. I can't wait to see what is next for this peculiar bunch.

B005HSG3TC|1.0|Do not confuse this item with a proper protective case or viewing stand. It is a flimsy, rubbery cover that is not rigid enough to offer your Kindle Fire's screen any real protection. Within 24 hours of receiving this item and using it a handful of times, the elastic band meant to keep the cover closed while not in use snapped off the cover's back. The cover does not reliably hold your Kindle Fire upright for video viewing, and will definitely fail while traveling by air or rail.  If you purchase this cover, be sure to also purchase the extended insurance for your Kindle Fire as it will undoubtedly be needed.

0525423281|4.0|Cute, quirky, and ripe with romantic tension, Lola and the Boy Next Door shows us yet again how capable Ms. Perkins is at writing relationships that have us pinging back and forth on the emotional spectrum, laughing one minute and then finding our hearts plummeting vicariously the next. While reading we can't help but surreptitiously glance out our windows in slightly obsessive fashion, hoping that by some fortuitous circumstance a beautifully perfect-for-us boy has spontaneously relocated next door and he's just now waiting for us to look up again to begin our dopey grin-inspiring romance. Like Anna and St. Clair before them, Lola and Cricket are characters we get a 360 degree picture of despite the flatness of the pages on which they exist, and we revel in their laughter and their drama as we treasure their story for days and weeks after reading.  Lola is funky and unique, living her life in costumes that allow her to express her exuberance and personality while also helping to hide some of the pain and embarrassment caused by her birth mother's unfortunate life choices. She's not quite as adorably endearing as Anna, perhaps due to the fact that in this tale it is she who is juggling the progression of one relationship with the desire to explore a completely different one, and so her inner conflict often leads her to some poor decisions that hurt those around her. While her flaws are of course realistic and certainly forgivable, our desire to see her with Cricket is just so strong that every time she defaults to Max our heart gives an extra little throb of pain.  Cricket is sweet and charming in an understated way, his charisma not quite radiating from the pages as St. Clair's did, but his more quiet desire to remedy the misunderstandings of his shared past with Lola is equally appealing. It's both painful and amusing to watch the two of them communicate using everything but the words they most need to say as well as hear in return from the other, a feeling we canall relate to at some point or another in our own lives. The crackling tension resulting from all that's left unaddressed is seductively tortuous, wrapping around us tightly until our muscles object to the rigidity of our posture, yet we can't bring ourselves to let up for a moment until we reach the end of Lola and Cricket's story.  Though overall a touch less delectable than Anna and the French Kiss, Lola and the Boy Next Door does beautifully give us something Anna didn't--the incorporation of Lola and Cricket's families. Lola's dads are hugely involved in her life and are a pleasure to read about, their family conflicts providing believable drama and causing our view of everyone as a whole to rotate those last few degrees and bring us full circle. Ms. Perkins has a gift for writing wistfully romantic stories that still manage to be grounded in reality, sating our need for sweetness while keeping us from going into sugar shock with the perfect amount of angst and emotional turmoil. The wait for her next book will no doubt test the limits of our patience, but we can take comfort in knowing our time spent counting the days will be well worth it.  Rating: 4/5
0143117009|5.0|Growing up in America at the end of the Cold War, I should be forgiven for getting the impression that only an act of nuclear-powered global self-immolation stood between us and a glorious future of eternal progress, that only two possibilities existed: a future technological paradise and a blighted Mad Max wasteland. \\"Collapse\\" by Jared Diamond serves as antidote. Its litany of collapsed civilizations proves that only hubris allows us to imagine that our own civilization will go on forever or that it takes something as dramatic as nuclear war to bring it to an end. Diamond tries to shed light on how it will happen to us by examining the history of collapsed civilizations such as the Mayans, the Anasazi, the Greenland Norse, and the Easter Islanders. We may be done in by something as banal as soil erosion or over-dependence on imported resources. He manages to be surprisingly even-handed when he handles topics like climate change that have become fodder for American politics.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Out of this six albums, this one is definitely in the top three.  Most bands get softer with time, but the music is just as ferocious as \\"Revolutions per minute\\".  Although I will say the overall sound of the music is more mainstream and less \\"punk\\" than their earlier stuff.<br /><br />The transition from track #6 to track #7 (\\"Prayer of the refugee\\" into \\"Drones\\") might be the single best back to back songs on album I've ever heard.  Both songs in and of themselves are incredible, but the way they kind of melt into one another for six solid minutes of fury is breathtaking.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic album from start to finish.  If you are a Rise Against fan, this album is a must.
B001OSIV62|5.0|This movie is an example of pure art and beauty. And it is based on a real story and made by the original documents. It is true poetry. It is a masterpiece. Fantastic.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|I love that this fits the iPhone 4S, as I would expect, but it's really loose and doesn't stay snug all around.  It also adds quite a bit to the size and makes it hard to fit in my belt clip.  I do feel confident that it would protect my phone in most cases, just lacking in a few areas.
B000XXGMSS|5.0|First of all, I just received these boots so I cannot speak as to how they are going to hold up. With that being said, I love the look and feel of these Timberland boots. I live in one of the northern continental US states and with winter coming, I wanted a good looking boot I could wear for either going out to the bar or going to class.<br /><br />The boots looks sweet. I got them in Dark Brown and they go really nice with any shade of casual chino pants as well as most jeans. These are made out of leather so they do get the normal marks you would expect from everyday use. So if you were do scratch the leather it would leave a mark, which would easily rub out if you wanted it to. I love it though as it gives the boot a rugged, aged look to it. Quite nice.<br /><br />They feel very nice as well. This is my first pair of boots so I did not really know what to expect but they are very, very comfortable. There is a little extra support in the heel, so I am not worried if I have to be on my feet in these for many hours.<br /><br />Like the other reviewers claim, the sizing is a bit tricky. I wasn't too sure which size to get as some of the other postings conflict with each other. I mainly wear a size 12 in my Nike Shox and other brands of athletic shoes. I bought these in size 11 M and they are perfect, and I do mean perfect and bigger or smaller and it would be uncomfortable. So I think it would be one size down from your Nike shoe. Also if it helps from end to end my foot is about 11 inches.<br /><br />At the time I bought these boots they were $60 more expensive at the local department store, so buying them on Amazon was, again, a no-brainer for me.<br /><br />And if you are smug like me, they are Eco-Friendly.<br /><br />I will update this review as I find out more about how the upcoming winter weather will affect traction and if the boot does not wear well.
B004S7G6BS|5.0|For me, this re-issue is perfect. I can finally put away my original somewhat crackly copy and listen to this one now. It's also always been one of my favorite all time albums...great rock and roll at it's best. I buy a considerable amount of re-mastered/re-issued music and unfortunately it's a mixed bag in terms of quality at many different levels. I remember buying Second Winter on CD many years ago and finding that they took that standard approach of mixing the vocal and drums up...who in their right mind would ever mix Johnny's vocals \\"up\\" and his guitar \\"down\\"!? But that is not what they did on this one, this time they did it right, just like the original. A perfect re-issue and one of the great all time rock and roll albums of all time, every single song is great.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I'm actually very pleased with this product! It's very cheap, and very good quality. There are, however, a couple of things that I feel I should point out.<br /><br />First, the case that it comes in is a standard mass production case that most multi-disc sets use. Don't expect a lavish collectable case, especially for the price. The case is still very durable, and allows all of the movies to be stored in a small amount of space.<br /><br />Second, the films in this set ARE NOT THE SPECIAL EDITIONS. They are standard edition, as if the first disc from each movie was put in here. While there are some special features, there are not a lot.<br /><br />Next, the discs themselves appear to be great quality. All of mine worked extremely well, and there were no defects whatsoever, save one thing. The disc that I received for Deathly Hallows Part 1 is missing a cover. The disc is all black, and the title and copyright information are on there, but there is not picture. This, however does not in any way affect the viewing of the movie, and is only an aesthetic concern.<br /><br />Also, the box that the DVD's come in is not the absolute best quality, but it is sturdy. It serves it's purpose, and it looks very nice!<br /><br />PLease note, if you want something that's collectible, DO NOT BUY THIS SET. There are others out there that will better suit your needs. However, this set satisfies all of the casual viewers' needs. It presents the movies in an accessible, affordable manner, and is absolutely a great buy! I recommend this to all Harry Potter fans who wish to have all of the movies!<br /><br />EDIT As of Nov 12, 2013: It seems that the original product that I wrote this review for has been altered in some way. I'm very sorry for any confusion that results form this. Just to clear up, the set that i bought only included the 8 movies on regular DVDS. There were not any special features or extra discs.
B005GP7F8Y|3.0|I know I might stir the pot with this review. However, I own three different versions of this movie so I do have basis of comparison. The Brentwood version was the best I owned picture wise on DVD. While not the best it was watchable compared to Digiview version I owned as well, which was pretty unwatchable. So after of all negative reviews I have read I was all set to send my Blu-Ray copy back that I had originally pre-ordered with excitement since I love this movie as much as you guys. I decided to look at the Blu-Ray myself just before sending it back. So here is my review of the One Eyed Jacks Blu-Ray and I will try to be objective and fair. First, I put the Blu-Ray in my Samsung player and I had the issues everyone else had trying to get past the copyright warning screen. Once I figured out that pressing the pop up menu button would bring up the main menu everything was ok. I had to change the language to English since the default was German, which was pretty easy to do. The opening credits were in German which might bother some, but it didn't really bother me.  Now the part everyone cares about the picture and audio quality. If you were comparing this to a transfer of The Searchers well of course The Searchers would win hands down in comparison. I used The Searchers as an example since both are Vista Vision prints. The Searchers has had major restoration work done so of course it's going to look better. However, compared to other versions of One Eyed Jacks I own on DVD this Blu-Ray is by far the best version available. It looks pretty decent on my Samsung 52in 120hz HDTV is it the version we all want? No, but it's by far the best version out there IMHO until Paramount or a major studio undertakes the needed restoration for this film. The colors could be better but a small color adjustment on my T.V. helped quite a bit. Overall, and like I said before I am fairly happy with this Blu-Ray of One Eyed Jacks and consider it a decent upgrade until a studio like Paramount spends the money to restore the original negative. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helps someone who is on the fence and not sure of which way to go.  Bob
082300659X|5.0|This book carefully and comfortably teaches the art of drawing. It make me feel that I can do it. It has a step by step guide that walks you from a blank page to a work of art.  Amazing.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I'm not sure why other reviewers are giving this item bad reviews! Of course you could argue that it's overpriced, but most accessories are because that's where they make the most money. As for the quality...I find that this case is perfect in that it's slim yet sturdy. While the top flap is very thin and feels flimsy, it's only a screen protector so I didn't expect much anyway. The main structure of the case is very solid and has a tight fit around the Kindle Fire. There's no way this case is going to slip off easily. The elastic band is a great addition for keeping the flap down, but I don't think I'll ever use it so its quality is not my concern.<br /><br />Other reviewers have stated that the foldable flap does not keep the Kindle propped up right, but I found this to be inaccurate. It just takes a bit of lining up to get it sitting right. I even found that once the flap is sitting properly in the back groove, you can lightly tap the Kindle and it will NOT fall over.<br /><br />All in all, I'm the type of person that generally doesn't like cases, but when I do decided to purchase one, I only go for minimalistic styles and this one fits the bill! It doesn't add any unnecessary weight or dimension to the Fire and the material feels just like the back of the actual Kindle itself. If you're looking for a case that allows you to store business cards, small pens or other small items, this is not the case for you.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|does not seem to run on my new fire. hope for an update soon. and cloud storage or syncing of saved games would be great.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Everyone with a smartphone, tablet device or Google Chrome web browser knows about this game. Angry Birds on the Kindle Fire is just as awesome! It runs super fast and plays very smoothly. I never tried the ad-supported version so I'm not sure how many advertisements I'm skipping with my $0.99 purchase price, but for $0.99, even skipping 1 ad would be worth it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this game is so addicting! Also, given the various devices I currently own and have owned, I must have purchased this same app over 4 times! Anyway, if you loved the first game, you'll love this one!! Plus, it's only $0.99...get it and trust me when I say you'll spend more time on this app than doing anything productive.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I loved this game. good fun. nice levels and bosses. wish their was more levels. played all day straight through. good job
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Shame on Warner Brothers for advertising the Flixster service as a true digital copy. I am weighing whether I should return the disc or keep it. Shame.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I like the game a lot ,and the noises the bugs make it  would be nice if they said phrases
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|First of all let me say the movie is great, no complaints there.  I bought this package however to load the digital copy on my iPad before a trip.  I followed the directions on the insert, created my accounts, and then nothing...  The screen said it would start loading Adobe AIR and flixster.  That didn't happen.  Tried another browser, same thing.  So I installed them both manually.  An hour of looking later, I found no way to download the movie.  Even had I been successful, you have to load flixster on your device to play the movie, it won't be with you other movies.  That's a bit annoying too.  I emailed customer service with no response.  Googling has shown I am not alone in not being able to download the movie.  I have 20+ years of IT experience, and this is about the worst user experience I have seen..
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Fix it please. I still wanna play it although I had to start over 2 times. Samsung Exhibit, game freezes, reboots phone, loses saves when alarm went off.
B00511PTWM|4.0|This dual port cigarette lighter just works! We have cars that only have one cigarette lighter and another one that has one in front and one in a console that is kind of far out of reach. It is very simple to use. You just plug it in and then plug in your other devices and you're done. I am glda of the design that you can swivel it up or down so it could adapt to how your plug is positioned in your car.<br /><br />Be wary that because of the design, the adapter does jut out pretty far. We have an issue in our corolla where it is right up against the shifter and because of the position of the cigarette lighter, we can't really push it up to give it a little extra room.<br /><br />However, the design works excellent in our prius as we can use the extra room and won't have to reach down as far to reach our cigarette lighters.<br /><br />This works great and works as advertised. Just make sure the design of your car would help accomodate the length of the adapter.
1933633867|5.0|Before reading the book I looked at an interview with Charlie Rose in 2006 after Graeber was not invited back to teach at Yale, and another recent interview with PBS on the launch of his new book on the History of Debt. Also there were a few good summaries of the book and topic, including one found on Eurozine from August 2009. More recently (6 Aug 2011) David Graeber wrote a comment in the WSJ Speakeasy (...credit money has been around a lot longer than money), with a respectable trail of comments. There is also a 23 Aug 2011 C-SPAN video link of 54 minute interview available. The debate on some Amazon review feedbacks is also interesting, or \\"lively\\" to use another word.  Some friends made few comments looking at the book's 534 pages along the lines that the book was \\"too big.\\" So for those with shorter attention spans going for the short summaries on the web makes sense.    But actually this is the type of book that needs to be this long - if not longer... a lot longer (as a part I and II?). It's an investment. And given the book is pretty well written and set-up, this is a relatively good investment. Rarely do I find books I can read cover to cover. This is one of them, almost. Even if it will take some time to cross the divide from the first chapter, a critique of Adam Smith (interesting), to the last chapter on our current era post-1971 (less interesting).   Despite my not agreeing on some of the conclusions and choices to expand on, the major part of the book I read with an open mind. I did take on board most of facts and debates, and I did allow my brain  to conduct certain file updates and memory over-writes.  On specific chapters dealing with social history, where Graeber's strengths as an archeologist are, I think we have to trust the author and absorb the main lessons - and then come back to the disagreements afterwards. I don't usually advocate this process for many books, because many authors are barely qualified to write on their subject. When I don'ttrust an author to really know their material it has the effect of not allowing me to settle back and enjoy a book (as in some of the recent Wall Street blow up books. I am thinking of Chasing Goldman in this instance, as it is fresh in my mind). Ultimately there are a significant amount of issues I disagree on, while at the same time I am better for reading the book.  This book goes onto my must read list, among others: On Tyranny (the one with letters to and from Kojeve); Oriental Despotism; Orientalism; Manias, Panics, and Crashes; The British Rail Mania of 1840s; The Great Wave: Price Revolutions... (interestingly, Graeber makes no mention of David Hackett Fischer's The Great Wave, even though there are many shared topics in certain key sections. The book is not referenced in bibliography or discussed in footnotes.)   Critical comparison: The Great Wave is about Price and the environment's impact on price; Graeber's is about human nature's impact on the stock of [money], after leaving the ideology parts aside. Graeber has talked us through the psychology and sociology of debt and money, but not enough, perhaps, on the price of it.  I am only an observer and not an expert on most of the subjects, so the following are my impressions only, though I do take issue with a few points on China and the development of Buddhism.  ***  Chapter 1 (moral confusion & introduction): Graeber jumps around his book's conclusions a little with mostly contemporary stories. This chapter can be read through briefly, before jumping into the book...    Chapter 2 (myth of barter): The book itself almost begins with a critique of the basis of Adam Smith's work, which is a well thought out first shot (does it undermine the methods and exegetical style of Smith but not the historical implications of the invisible hand?... does it merely place Smith among many others seeking expediency and pretexts just to get on with their work?). For Graeber, discrediting Smith appears important because he is aiming to deprogram us on the significance of a barter economy and its role in early times. The barter economy did not exist in many societies, as theorized by many who kicked off our global economy. If it did not exist, the function and meaning of money (gold/silver backed money) is not as central. As we see many places later in the book, it is credit (virtual money) that is the original form of money. The barter system functioned not within societies, but between enemies... (which links back to a theme of violence we will be brought back to again and again throughout the book).   The professional work on critiques such as the Adam Smith critiques appears well done, although one has to be an insider to really say how well done, as quite often a lot of work we take in mainstream as interesting is already old hat for insiders (and they have their own defining moment debates).  ... The entire issue of going after Adam Smith and the economics profession - by an anthropologist - is actually interesting. And yet it is also common sense we have tended to forget. Graeber takes multiple jabs at economists throughout, to be sure.   Chapter 3 (primordial debt): We continue with problems interpreting barter. Concepts of barter were created in the image of the economists doing the interpretations. We then move on to other factions, including Credit Theorists, Chartalists, Keynes, primordial debt theorists. I've extracted and expanded a discussion on the Wizard of Oz (a little later) - the yellow brick road is the gold standard. There is an important linked discussion on governments, ancient texts and intermediaries and sacrifices to gods for repaying debt (redemption discussion comes again later). Human existence is a form of debt itself. There is a discussion on Yama, the lord of death, and other gods and the earliest writings on forms of debt in the Vedas (India) in 1500 - 1200 BC. A survey of work on \\"primordial debt\\" takes us back up to western links cross-cultures tothe reminder that debt, guilt, tax, sin were concepts often joined together, as in tax was Gild in Gothic...Primordial debt theorists also are shown to have their pitfalls and ways to mythologize key events/issues. Money lending is used as an example against primordial debt theory - it was used in times not even explored by primordial debt theorists, and in ways opposite at times to expectations (and when rulership structures were more fluid...some were not even sure which rulers they owed their allegiances to). Interest bearing loans pre-dated writing somewhere before 3000 BC and by 2400 BC it was well established. Before ending the chapter we learn that primordial debt theorists were essentially interested in debts to society. We end on an introduction to sociology and primordial debt as \\"the ultimate nationalist myth.\\"  As often seen with Graeber - the ultimate problem is how to contextualize in the time period certain facts and fragments we are working with today. ... We can trace back to the `pub' in Mesopotamia but can't get into the minds of what the pub crawlers say and mean when they discuss certain facts/issues. (Benjamin Franklin was wrong when he said death and taxes were the two certain things in this world, as in many classical societies, Citizens did not pay taxes (although they may have paid fees)).  Chapter 4 (cruelty and redemption): There is lots of use for Nietzsche in this chapter. But the most enjoyable part for me is the discussion of regional moneys (again discussed later that there was a shortage of bullion backed money, so other systems stood in...in some case in England local moneys would circulate only within a radius of a few blocks). An example on gaming counters used as money in 19th century Siam, and even methods to the madness of redeeming them in case of failure of issuing Casino (p74). We get to the famous discussion on the Law of Jubilee by p. 82.   What is interesting is the case Graeber builds on all the efforts over time that have gone into \\"papering over\\" the origins and the history of money. Later we will see him attacking some of the more known recent writers on the history of money. His discussion on redemption and its relation to debt although discussed here, continue elsewhere in the book as well.  Chapter 5 (moral grounds of economic relations). This chapter is a little more narrative. There are some discussions on the nature of heroic societies (and elsewhere, of course). Graeber likes heroic societies where warrior noblemen are lionized and governments weak. Epic poetry - the classics such as the Iliad, Beowulf, Mahabharata (and I guess the Water Margin/All Men are Brothers or Shui Hu Zhuan in Chinese, and even the Journey to the West, Xi You Ji, are not mentioned?) - come from this mold. And there is some discussion on theory of exchange, which Graeber spends some time on as he is trying to re-work Adam Smith on Exchange Theory as well, which then also leads into Gift Economics, (Marcel Mauss in bibliography, Essai sur le don). And then this goes into issues on Equality, and multiple discussions throughout the book on various anthropological findings, reports, experiences from various cultures. There is a good discussion of Exchange Theory also in a Dictionary of Sociology, 1998, by Gordon Marshall, I referenced for background. The logical discussion is one on the heroic gift, which is discussed in a few places.   There is a section on communism, thankfully not much on the more modern form, with some time spent on the Iroquois. I am of course going to have to re-read much of this material as there is so much, including a citation on Santa Claus as benevolent burglar.  Chapter 6 (game with sex and death): We learn about primitive moneys and the phenomenon of the Irish bondmaids (cumal; p 128), who were used as a means of exchange, and standard amounts of cumal for transactions and repayment of blood money, including complex systems for calculations, which is discussed in more detail later again, as in pp 171-176. We find later as well later in a very complex form using body parts with one of the German princes, Casimir of Brandenburg, pp 323-25. Money is an inadequate substitute during the marriage process in many societies. Money is merely a down-payment for assuming the responsibilities and [taking] a woman from her family. There is also wergeld, which is bloodmoney for the loss of life restitution process.   There are long discussions on the Tiv of Central Nigeria and the Lele who organized their society around blood debts. Graeber in this chapter spends some time on the slave trade as slavery is key to the rise of market. But again, later, slavery in Rome and its relationship to different concepts of freedom is discussed (ie, pp 198-207 in following chapter). In later and other discussions he points out that Europe of the Middle Ages did away with slaves and came to represent a higher form of development than the later European empires which re-founded the practices. I don't know if I'll have time to go back over all this, but there seems to be a main theme here of trying to show the development of the `modern' west as a backward development (back to his 1% rulers 99% effective economic slaves concept, which was often the case in ancient times and is again the case today...). Money is intricately tied to violence...  Chapter 7 (honor and degradation): \\"Honor is surplus dignity\\" is a title of an early section in the chapter, as we continue discussions on slavery. On p 169 I start thinking of the film Gladiator and Russell Crowe as the general (Maximus) turned gladiator, with one of the more famous quotes being \\"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.\\" Maybe Graber could have put a reference in there. You can't getmore surplus dignity than that!   In this chapter we learn how women came to be veiled in some societies (pp 184-85). And then we go into a discussion of debt and women and slaves (and women as debt pawns). Even Plato faced being a slave (p197).  The money used for Plato's ransom was eventually re-used as well to pay for the land to start his Academy.  Money is also a symbol of degradation, lost honor (p189). But in this chapter we learn about the thorough impact Rome had on the world long after its rule ended (its codification of jurisprundence). A good discussion on Rome's slavery system follows as well (pp 198 - 207).  Chapter 8: (credit versus bullion): We move into part II of the book here and this is a transition and short introductory chapter. Slavery has been eliminated many times in human history (... and it will be again no doubt). Graeber gives us his re-categorization for the big periods of history 1) 3500 - 800 BC, the Agrarian Empires; 2) 800 BC - 600 AD, the Axial Age (not to be confused with an original definition by Jaspers, which Graeber cites later on p 223) - and the period when we shift to metal bullion and the rise of coinage; 3) 600-1450 which encloses the Middle Ages; 4) 1450 - 1971 which becomes an expanded version of the Age of Capitalist Empires. ... To be sure Graeber is probably signaling he wants a lot of historians before him to roll over in their graves as he re-categorizes.... 1971 is the year Nixon took the US off the gold standard and a time when many consider as the true rise of fiat money. We can all debate this back and forth. What is to be sure is that Graeber's book is not the place to debate this, as seen also by his short discussions on key thinkers such as Mises. I think the book would have had to be even longer. Or perhaps Graeber can re-direct for a follow up.   Chapter 9 (the Axial Age): In the Axial age, coinage came to be monopolized by the state. India was using uniform sized silver bars by the Sixth Century BC, and coin was used throughout Persia after taking Lydia, and of course was used in Greece. The point made again and again is that often precious metals and coin do not function as currency. It was often the smaller things and objects standing in for what we today consider currency that was used. And, of course, the example is coins issued to pay soldiers during Rome's reign, and the earlier example of coin, minted in Lydia to pay mercenaries, p 227. By 480 BC, we are told, there were some 100 mints in operation in Greek cities.  Again, violence is a theme well illustrated through death and destruction of cities.  In 594 BC Athens, Graeber illustrates a debt crisis caused by things other than money, where Graeber believes coin was a solution to the crisis, in this case, in that it kept peasants out of slavery and not indebted to the ruling class. Graeber continues to cite example after example of what we would consider crackpot systems today - or then maybe not. If some Greek states were institutionalizing the \\"distribution of loot\\" then Graeber probably wants us to find the parallels today as well. And we can find such examples, of course, only more often perhaps in a more systematic fashion. Graeber gives credit to Alexander the Great in the form of identifying his destructive conquests as a last blow to ancient credit systems. So, symbolically the Greeks and war really did bring about the advent of currency, though it still was not functioning fully, might also be claim. ... But here perhaps one might miss pointing out that the last of Alexander's indirect legacies were also blown up by the Taliban in the mountain's of Afghanistan only recently, as these Buddhist mountain carvings from the Gandhara period of Indian Buddhism (roughly 100 BC to 700 AD) and representing a wave of cultural revival and growth around central Asia that had been beautifully preserved in Afghanistan before its destruction. No doubt though, no side except the Taliban would support this approach.In Greece and Rome military expansion was again and again associated with trying to solve problems at home, we are told on p231...Nothing's changed in other words. No issue here from me.  The history of India shows up similar patterns we are told. But then we take a turn toward the impact of Buddhism as Graeber sees it, and King Ashoka as a turning point, which will then take us into a discussion of China... \\"Buddhism is one of the few great world religions not to have condemned usury (p235).\\"  We later learn of the development of the pawn shop around Buddhist temples, of course. Graeber does make an important distinction that social movements were more linked to religion and philosophy earlier on in China's history than in the west's development. In Greece, philosophy was for the civic elite...   Speaking of India and stockpiling precious things, and a recent story that Graeber may have missed due to timing, was the finding of a lost treasure in Southern India and the explanation of some issues related to it.  The treasure dates back only 150 years or so, and was estimated at $22bn. One can only imagine how to go about trying to price and track precious objects over thousands of years.  The second section of this chapter on the Axial Age deals with \\"materialism\\" and the discussion of earlier concepts of profit or \\"advantage.\\" We go further into classic schools of thought, Mengzi vs Mozi, for instance, and Mozi's \\"Jianai\\" or universal love versus Mengzi's more orthodox views, where Confucians in most periods have been seen to seek to follow codes of conduct rather than profit. Back in early Greece the founding of pre-Socratic Greek philosophy is seen as timed with the birth of coin and its functionality in the 6th century BC and in the environs of Miletus on the western coast of Anatolia.  An interesting point on early inflation and the spread of currency debasement trends is made on p 246. The tension between how widespread currency is and its limited role in society become a little hazy here, as Graeber tells the story he needs to show, but does not want to give in himself to early concepts/application of quasi fiat money already being present. But I am never really sure where he really wants to go with refusing to place money's full usage earlier in history either. Either way, at the moment, as a reader I just want to absorb and learn the wealth of information imparted. I am not about to boil down my conclusions just yet, as Graeber may want me to, to believing that western philosophy is mainly influenced by the rise of money (p247). I mean - why not go another direction perhaps, that the money, being linked to war, also leads to an opposite, to those who were at the other end of daily behavior patterns choosing to engage in exercising their brains more ... I will still view the two histories separately, even if linked, back to the coast of Turkey while it was still Greek circa 600 BC. But I am the better for seeing this I think.  Chapter 10 (Middle Ages): I think that The Great Wave (the book Graeber didn't reference) tells us something very interesting about price performance and the environment from the Middle Ages up to recent history. But Graeber's narrative is also riveting to me. The entire phase of growth of terror and the search for gold is brought into focus in a few pages and the story of Cortes (p316 among others) provides a vivid illustration of mistaken drivers for conquest of empire. The story is sad indeed. But whereas we were told earlier that Buddhists tolerated usury we are told on p 319 that the Catholic Church did not. I am confused. What is Graeber saying here. In my understanding, the Church did not function as one body (and would not the Medicis, who worked closely with the Church did they not, have been an example of usury?). But certainly I could agree that the point is that many amongst Catholics of the day strove to get back to clarity of mind, even though there were bad eggs (at the same timeGraeber missed out on so many types of Buddhism and other thought systems. What's the point of generalizing when also spending so much time on details?). That paper money was a government response to usury of Buddhist pawn shops would seem to perhaps be a generalization that Graeber has led the reader to. It is likely true. But is that the impact of Buddhism we want the reader to take away?   On the discussions of tallies, and the use of fu, which is mainly on pp298-302, I found the treatment interesting and useful. On Graeber's treatment of Islam I know relatively less about, but take on board the strengths of Arab commerce and thought during the Middle Ages (pp271-281). Graeber does spend some time on Ghazali (1058-1111 AD), also to show some early work in economics with parallels centuries ahead of the later new western economists, and of course Adam Smith. Ghazali's discussion on the function of money (p281) is interesting: \\"[gold, silver]...money as symbol, as abstract measure, having not qualities of its own, whose value is only maintained by constant motion...\\" This of course takes us back to a comparison with Aristotle and a discussion on the term symbolon, which is to be compared to the tally or fu in Chinese (p283 and pp 298-299). Ghazali was perhaps recycling Aristotle as an age in process of rediscovery. In the end, \\"money is whatever the king or emperor wishes it to be\\" we here a few times.  Chapter 11 (the great capitalist empires):  As we get closer to the present I cite less and less examples (and will not really discuss post Nixon...). Also, Graeber by this time, as is often the case, is circling back over many of the same issues. But he does spend time in this chapter on the idea that China's relation with the west, ultimately kick started by Spain's and Europe's surplus gold taken from S America, is the beginning of higher volume trade and \\"global\\" trade, although we all know of the earlier Silk Road, of course. It is interesting to see von Glahn's work on China's medieval economy here, and to see the data on China imports of silver in the 16th Century. By the early 17th Century China is peaking at 116 tons a year of silver imports, up from 50 tons a year a few decades earlier. Note in 2010-11 talk of China gold imports, with about 120 tons in 2010 and potentially 300+ tons in 2011.  We find an explanation on the causes of inflation on p 313. According to Graeber, inflation came from the shift in gold and silver functions from symbolically representing money to actually being money (and the control at government/banker/merchant level). In other words, we again come back to a theme underlying many discussions that a switch from the older credit systems and local systems of trust to the new system [global trade based on completely interchangeable moneys...] is the root of many breakdowns.   We then circle back to debt. Somewhere else in the book Graeber noted that debt functioned as money as long as it was not repaid. There is a great story cited on a British soldier in HK in the 1950s and how his bar tab paid on a English bank check circulated as currency, with this particular check six months later bearing some forty endorsements on its back (p47).  '  ***  A last item on the Wizard of Oz  The Wizard of OZ as allegory on plight of foreclosed farmers in 1890s, highlighted on P.53. The interpretation makes much sense, though also contested by some.  The American Quarterly in 1964 published a piece by Henry M Littlefield on the Wizard as a parable. ...  \\"...the wicked Witch of the East represented eastern industrialists and bankers who controlled the people (the Munchkins); the Scarecrow was the wise but naive western farmer; the Tin Woodman stood for the dehumanized industrial worker; the Cowardly Lion was William Jennings Bryan, Populist presidential candidate in 1896; the Yellow Brick Road, with all its dangers, was the gold standard; Dorothy's silver slippers (Judy Garland's were ruby red, but Baum originally made them silver) represented the Populists' solution to the nation's economic woes (\\"the free and unlimited coinage of silver\\"); Emerald City was Washington, D.C.; the Wizard, \\"a little bumbling old man, hiding behind a facade of papier mache and noise, . . . able to be everything to everybody,\\" was any of the Gilded Age presidents.\\"  Source: chicagohistorybooks
B00004WNZR|4.0|I've had this album on vinyl for years, but just recently gotten into it. So damn good. It does have a very urban sound, back alleys and timeless in a way. It's pretty consistent all the way through. Good guests on vocals, and Guru does his thing well as always. Listen to the song \\"When You're Near\\". If you don't like it, then you know it's time to stick with Jay-Z.<br /><br />If you dig throwback groups like Digable Planets or Jurassic 5, you'll like this.

B005HV6Y84|1.0|Let me start by saying that I LOVE the Twilight Saga books, movies, soundtracks, everything...EXCEPT THIS CD!  Clearly the producers lost vision and did not consult Stephenie Meyer AT ALL on this soundtrack.  WHERE IS THE MUSE?????  Any fan knows that Muse is Meyer's favorite band.  Instead the headliner on this soundtrack is Bruno Mars.  Bruno Mars? REALLY???  I think I just threw up a little in my mouth.  If you are a fan, please save your money!  The best songs going on this CD are Flightless Bird, American Mouth the wedding version which is not as good as the original Twilight soundtrack version; and Love Death Birth which is all instrumental.  I can only hope that they can pull it together for the Part 2 Soundtrack.

I actually prepaid for the season so it's a ;ittle less but Hulu plus would still be cheaper. So why Did I prepay to watch it on Amazon when they can't get it at the same time as Hulu Plus? Should I cancel my amazon preorders and just buy Hulu plus for around 10 bucks a month?

0393061310|5.0|A fascinating journey through history investigating the factors of geography and biological circumstances which led some human societies to advance technologically while others stagnated. Beginning with the simplest human societies, Diamond explains in great detail what led to the advancements that allowed small tribal communities to develop into larger civilizations with sufficient surplus of resources to allow for the development of technologies which would propel those societies to be among the conquerors as opposed to those being conquered.  Diamond provides thorough research and evidence to back his conclusions, and his arguments are well developed and seem to lead the reader from one point to the next while leaving no doubt as to logic used to lead.  While there may be some critics who find the assertion that geographic and biologic \\"luck\\" shaped the world as we know it today too simplistic, Diamond's book provides a very well stated \\"unified\\" theory of human societal development.  There are certainly other factors which have entered into the complex history of human societies, but Diamond's point seems to be that these other factors, while historically significant, are relatively minor in comparison to the long-term and globally attributable influences of geography and the availability of domesticable plant and animal species in different parts of the world.

B0034G4ORC|1.0|Although it is not always the case, most of my friends who like elaborate science fiction movies do not like low budget horror flicks and vice versa.  My sci fi friends like detailed story lines, (somewhat) believable technology type devices/theories, and a little bit of humor helps too. My budget horror flick friends prefer something that scares the poop out of them every few minutes and the less plausible the storyline with moronic characters the better chance to do this (otherwise the movie drags).  This movie is like some idiot in hollywood thought it would be a great idea to give a low budget horror flick director/writer a chance to make a sci fi movie.  None of my friends liked this movie for this very reason.  Sci fi friends found the alien invasion premise and technical weapons/tactics nonsensical and the military characters stereotypical cookie cut actors (not believable). My budget horror flick friends thought the aliens were not scary at all, the human characters boring, and most of all, the movie was a real drag. Having no humor in the movie did not help.   Both groups felt the people who created this movie had no original thoughts of their own and possibly were on crack when they wrote this thing up. Okay, maybe not on crack, but pretty close to it.  What a disaster! Two hours of my life that I will never get back and a complete waste of brain cell memory.

This video helped me lose 30 pounds in only 2 short months! In combination with around a 1300-1400 calorie a day diet this video is the greatest! Plus, this video is FANTASTIC for people who are short on time.  I at one time ran a minimum of three hours a day in combination with a twenty minute work out routine, and I must say that this video gave me better results than anything I had done before although it takes up half the time.  Jillian really knows how to target your muscles in a way that makes them look amazing and you feel great. In addition to weight loss this video is great for people looking to gain lean muscle. I love this video, it's the best of it's kind!
B0043EV774|4.0|Even though the storyline follows nearly the same path as the Disney classic and Lewis Carroll's beloved work, it derails itself from the set path by mid-movie.  And thank goodness for that.  This is a sequel of sorts to our original Disney film where a young Alice tumbles down the rabbit hole to encounter Wonderland for the first time.  Instead of that, Burton takes the reins and makes Alice 19 and about to be wed to a rather frumpy young gentleman.  She flees, following her imagination of a rabbit skittering about the grounds of her future in-laws property, only to find herself tumbling down yet another rabbit hole to Wonderland.  She has forgotten much of what she remembers from her first encounter in Wonderland and chalks the experience up as a mere dream.  However, as she become more and more involved she finds that Wonderland truly is real and what she does there matters.<br /><br />Although Tim Burton relies heavily on the stories that Lewis Carroll has already set into place this is right up his alley.  Carroll and him could have had long discussions over tea about such fanciful, near delusional, half mad contrivances.  The compatibility of the two creators is perfect.  Burton throws his own flair into the film at every turn and provides the stories and poems that we are all familiar with.<br /><br />With the talents of Johnny Depp, Mia Wasikowska, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, with a wide array of talented voice actors, we are greeted with a stunning performance by all in this incredible display of computer technology melting with live action so seamlessly it's hard to tell what is real and what isn't at times, which fits well into the theme.<br /><br />One problem I have is that Alice becomes our heroine in a far too heroic sense.  It definitely deviates a bit sharply from the original stories and concepts lent to us by Carroll and so is a bit farfetched.  However, the part is well conceived by Mia Wasikowska and the other supporting cast.<br /><br />A superbly portrayed, layered duality also exists in this film.  There are connections to all that knows Alice in the \\"real world\\" and in her \\"imaginative world\\".  It's a simply stunning two hours that will blow you away if you let it.  Allow for the oddities as Carroll would and you have a perfectly wonderful film.y also exists in this film.

0062059882|5.0|It is important to take a moment and look at the books on our shelves and to give them a second read. With so many books and so little time, we can't possibly do this for all of our favorite books, but there are some classics and classics-in-the-making that deserve another reading. One such book is American Gods by Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />Before I start, I should mention that I dedicate this review to Wednesday. If you don't know what I'm taking about, it's time to visit your bookstore. Go now.<br /><br />This year is the tenth anniversary of the publication of American Gods. I can't tell you how many people I know who have been shocked by the fact that ten years have passed since Gaiman's novel first hit the shelves. What surprises me most about this book is that it feels as fresh and relevant today as it felt ten years ago. Likely, I'll be saying these same words ten years from now. I have no doubt that readers and scholars alike will be picking up American Gods in fifty or sixty years and using it as a stick in the sand by which to measure other books that were written in the early twentieth century, but only time will tell.<br /><br />In a nutshell, American Gods is one man's journey to rebuild his life after getting released from prison. Little does Shadow know that the gods have other plans for him, and little do they know that he has his own plans.<br /><br />American Gods is a beautifully told story that is gorgeously written. The characters are all strong, unique individuals. With each turn of the page, you feel like you are getting to know a live person replete with all of the human (and inhuman) flaws that come with wanting to hang onto whatever form of \\"life\\" they may be experiencing. This novel spreads out, telling a complex tale that spans a huge geographic area, a large number of people, and quite a bit of history and lore. However, as sprawling as American Gods may be, it maintains a cohesiveness that broadens and deepens the reading experience.<br /><br />When I first finished reading American Gods, I remember feeling like I had lost something important (innocence, perhaps), but I gained something of much greater value in return (wisdom, I hope). After rereading American Gods, I was left with the feeling that if there must be gods among us in this \\"new\\" world of ours, let them be writers who weave tales, tell stories, and keep us bound together in myth and fiction that helps us to better understand ourselves and our world. Neil Gaiman is a phenomenally brilliant writer and storyteller, especially when he turns his hand to these darker adult novels that dare you to think in unconventional ways and inspire you to imagine \\"what if\\" there were ancient and new gods among us? What would the world be like? Would we even know? Would we want to know?<br /><br />American Gods is one of those books that you will not forget. It is a book that will likely remain on your bookshelf for years to come. If it's on your shelf now, I urge you to open it and to give it another read. If you haven't yet had the opportunity to read American Gods, you are missing out on something special.<br /><br />It also bears mentioning that HBO is planning to produce American Gods as a multi-season series. More information on the development of the series is sure to be coming soon., I remember feeling like I had lost something important (innocence, perhaps), but I gained something of much greater value in return (wisdom, I hope).

0553582038|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I know it's received mostly \\"so-so\\" reviews, but I found this one to be on par with Game of Thrones.  There is going to be some spoiler information here, so proceed with caution.  Here are some major themes from the book:<br /><br />Jaime and Cersei:  Their relationship becomes strained.  Cersi is starting to creep closer and closer to insanity.  She has convinced herself that someone is always after Tommen, and is really setting up some concrete walls to \\"protect\\" him (or is it really herself and her power she's trying to protect?).  Jaime is growing colder to her, partly because she is pushing him away.  She's convinced that he cannot protect her b/c of his lack of a sword hand, so he's \\"useless\\" to her.<br /><br />Sansa:  This part of the story is really weird.  Littlefinger has taken her to the Eyrie to live with her aunt.  Some strange things happen here that hopefully will intrigue you, but expect to be left in the dark wondering where this thread will lead you when this character is revisited.<br /><br />Brienne:  She is sent out by Jaime to find Sansa Stark and protect her once she finds her.  Along the way she runs into Podrick Payne who decides to follow her during her quest.  These two things combined provide for an interesting twist for Brienne.<br /><br />Arya:  Arya is in Braavos, studying with the Faceless Men.  Here she learns to assimilate into society and become part of the shadows.  I really wish that more time was spent on her character because we don't get a lot and then there is a very large event that occurs in her life.<br /><br />Samwell:  Sam is sent from the wall to Oldtown to forge his chain become a maester.  I could have really done without his chapters.  They are full of whining about the conditions and being scared, but that's what's so great about Martin is that the character's attributes come out so strongly in the writing.<br /><br />Dorne:  Dorne gets a pretty big role here.  It's nice because previously we don't know much about it.  But, if the world of Westeros is to engage in complete civil war, all areas must jump in.  Don't expect to see what's coming with them until the end.<br /><br />Iron Islands:  The Iron Islands are the focus of many chapters, as again, if one is to have a giant conflict, all the entities from the land should be warring, right?  On the Iron Islands a new king is crowned and determines that Westeros can belong to the Iron Islands.  They proceed to work their way south and end up attack Oldtown.<br /><br />Don't let the fact that there is a new host of characters introduced dismay you from enjoying this installment of the series.  If you've made it this far, you know that Martin can make the story fascinating from any angle.<br /><br />Now onto Dance with Dragons!eros is to engage in complete civil war, all areas must jump in.

The demos are, well, unrelease, so who knows if they're the original mixes, but the 1973 Quadrophenia mixes are not original, they used the 1996 masters.  I guess that's what fans of the original masters call HOPELESS after finding out that the 1996 masters are on here instead...  If you have money to waste on this, go right ahead, but if you like the original masters and if you have a little more on your budget, try purchasing the Gold CD that was released in 1991.  Only 1 star for the demos, but that's it.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|I love this movie. This review is not about the film itself.<br /><br />The quality of this DVD is terrible! I have an imac desktop and movie resolution (even on my old DVDs) is great! This DVD is so pixelated, it looks like I'm playing a digital copy! I have never seen this before on a DVD.<br /><br />Speaking of digital copies... the UV digital copy is a joke. You have to have a flixster account on all your devices to play it digitally and you get a 3-yr rental of the copy you download. No thanks. Not worth it.<br /><br />I suggest either splurging on the Blue Ray - DVD - Digital Copy set or just buy the digital copy in iTunes.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am a 'Mac' person so I am biased.  With all that said this is one of my all time favorite reads.  The biographer answers all of my thoughts about Steve jobs.  \\"Why was he so mean?\\", Did his lack of empathy help/hurt Apple?  All of these questions were answered to my satisfaction.  Also I am a 'Microsoft hater' after using a PC for years; however I found the answers as to why; by seeing the different philosophy between Apple (Jobs) and Microsoft (Gates).  I came away the thinking that both went down different paths, neither one was right or wrong, only different.  Personally I think Jobs took the right path.  All in all a GREAT read.

B005POK858|5.0|Just because your phone doesn't meet the requirements to run the game does not mean u have a right to give the game a one star review. That's like saying a movie sucks but you have never seen it. Be real u one star reviewers.
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|I've been waithing a long time for this movie to be released in a better form. I got my copy today and I was totally disapointed. It's not any better than all the other junk out there. And NO subtitles. If I had known that I would have never purchased it.
B005EYP8PO|1.0|Disc 2 has all too familiar outtakes & B-sides while the more rare outtakes can only be had on the super expensive box set.  i think classic rock fans are starting to get tired of being milked by these \\"deluxe\\" re-releases.  no wonder cd sales are dropping.  would it hurt the labels to release a single disc remaster & add a free bonus disc of outtakes?  i think that would get better favor from consumers & probably sell a lot more copies.
0061537969|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, however, the flow of the book became very predictable after a while.  Whenever a depressing and long chapter came up, the very next chapter was a short lighthearted and laughable narrative of an incident which may or may not have tied in to the story-line.  The rhythm of this style of writing became a bit boring for me after a while, however I did enjoy the story as a whole.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Jake Epping couldn't cry.  His wife left him because of his \\"nonexistent emotional gradient.\\"  He didn't cry at his father-in-law's funeral, not even at his parents' funerals.  But he cried when his collie, Rags, was killed because he felt responsible for the dog's death, and when he received the news of his mother's sudden death.  He cried when he read a paper written by a disabled student in his adult education class, Hoptoad Harry.  With this introduction, Stephen King in his latest novel, 11/22/63, set the emotional mood in this novel filled with sentimentality and reflection surrounding the pivotal event of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.<br /><br />This introspective novel started with the musing of the precariousness of fate.  \\"Life turns on a dime.\\" The plot began with Jake reading Harry's paper, \\"The Day That Changed My Life.\\"  In one fateful night, Harry, born a normal, happy child, became a cripple whose best achievement is being able to maintain his janitorial job at the high school.  Harry's poignant account of the night his father murdered his family and crippled him brought \\"real tears, the kind that come from deep inside\\" out of Jake.  Changing Harry's circumstance formed the initial motivation for Jake when Al, of Al's diner, bequeathed the time portal in his pantry to him.  This time portal took him to the exact same time in1958 each time.  Each trip to 1958 is a reset.  Al had made frequent trips to buy cheap hamburgers for the diner.  But the trip to get hamburgers turned into missions.  It started with the urge to change the life of a woman Al had a crush on, then included the  attempt to prevent John F. Kennedy's assassination.  Unsuccessful in his attempt and dying of cancer, Al chose Jake as the best replacement for the job to save JFK.<br /><br />Throughout this lengthy novel, questions were raised about the morality and impact of disturbing the events of history, hinging on the chaos theory of the butterfly effect.  In the butterfly effect, a small initial condition can snowball into a huge event, as in the fluttering of a butterfly's wing causing atmospheric change, thereby producing a tornado elsewhere.  However, this is not a science fiction novel, but a novel about treasuring and living with what you have, and making the best of what fate has given you, even if at any moment fate can change on a dime. It is also about the realization that all our lives are tenuous and changeable, \\"Who can know when life hangs in the balance, or why?\\"  Perhaps King's latest novel was brought about by his reflection on his own life, his near poverty as a low-salaried teacher and unknown author, to his fame and wealth as a highly successful author, screen writer and director, to his near-fatal accident.  The dime turned often in his life.<br /><br />This enjoyable book was filled with vivid and sentimental description as Jake, now as George T. Amberson, left the pantry into a world where everything tastes good and natural, and people are polite and reserved.  But it is also a world where the politeness masks a deep racism and hatred of anything that is different.  George was torn between loving the homey, innocent feel that is rare in the 21st century, and hating the underlying ostracizing of society's fringe groups.  Most of this thick book was not focused on the assassination, but George's loving interaction with the people in the town of Jodi and a love affair with a librarian, while he awaits for Oswalt's movement.  This is where King is at his best, as each of his characters come alive.  They can be your neighbor down the street with real, human dialogues.  Mixed in with interactions that warms the heart and creates tears of sadness, is the foreshadowing that made King such a master of horror.  We are given ominous warnings of possible terrible things to come from George messing with time, with cautions about the butterfly effect,  that the past is obdurate and will do whatever it will to prevent change, even horrible things.  Harmonic echoes abound as obvious similarities are repeated in people and places George encounters, each echoing becoming higher in pitch, much as the air disturbance caused by the fluttering of a butterfly's wing evolving into a tornado, as the music from the harmonic echoes reaches an ear-piercing pitch.<br /><br />With his skillful approach to storytelling full of realistic human interaction, his usual way of making each interaction full of emotions, whether it be anger, fear or tears, his ability to foreshadow so that the little flutterings end in a stormy climax, and his vivid detailing, King made 11/23/63 an entertaining, solid read that does not disappoint.  Get yourself a nice cup of tea.  You might not want to put the book down until you're done.  Well, you might want to pause and flutter your arms a bit to see whether you can cause a tornado in Thailand.nge, even horrible things.

B005HSG3U6|2.0|When I preordered a Kindle Fire, this was one of two \\"official\\" cases that Amazon listed as recommended accessories at checkout.  The preorder price was about $40, and Amazon reduced the price to about $30 immediately after the case shipped.  However, the case is unacceptable, even at the reduced price.<br /><br />The case consists of a thin hard plastic (?) shell with a lightweight flexible plastic (?) cover.  The Kindle Fire clicks into the hard shell; and the cover forms a stand if you fold it in half and slip the edge into an extremely shallow slot that doesn't hold very securely.  It's possible that the hard shell is impact-resistant, but it feels like it will crack the first time that it is dropped or banged into something.<br /><br />With the cover folded around the Kindle Fire and secured by the elastic band, the case seems functional enough to protect the display screen from scratches as the device is carried around in a large pocket or bag.  However, I will definitely be replacing this case with something that feels less flimsy and unstable (with something that provides at least minimal minor-impact protection).  I rate this case at 2 stars.  My excellent Kindle Fire deserves better than this.<br /><br />Edit 11/17/11:  After a few days' use, I dislike this case even more.  The cover/stand is unusable because it collapses so easily.  When I try to use the Kindle Fire on a table or desktop, the cover/stand just gets in the way.  For now, my replacement case is the [[ASIN:B005QBK6B6 rooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle (Red) Leather Folio Case Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire 7-Inch Android Tablet]], which I find completely satisfactory.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Like most people who bought this product, I only ordered it because it came as a highly recommended suggestion from Amazon as an add-on for the Kindle Fire.  A buddy of mine got his Fire and the MicroShell yesterday and we couldn't help but remark that the MicroShell doesn't exactly compliment the Fire's form, in fact, the effect is quite to the contrary. Moreover, the product has an overall tacky feel to it and doesn't look like it should cost anything above $10.  I promptly tracked my order last night and canceled it upon discovering that it hadn't been shipped yet. Ordered the Belkin Folio for the Fire as they've never disappointed in the past.  If you're buying the Fire and are considering ordering a cover/shell for it, do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy the Marware MicroShell !
0307593312|4.0|1Q84 has been called Murakami's magnum opum and it is easy to see why- it is his longest most ambitious work to date and brings together many of the themes that Murakami have been a mainstay of Murakami's work.<br /><br />There are mysterious women, strange occurances, weird synchronicities, weird sexual fantasies and of course, beneath it all, a love story.<br /><br />I don't want to give much away, but the story concerns mainly the interrelated tales of Aomame and Tengo and their foray into the alternate reality of 1Q84. Tengo gets wrapped up in writing a book, while Aomame gets involved in murder.<br /><br />The story is surprisingly interesting throughout the entire novel despite some very slow sections. For me, this book could have been Murakami's best, but an extremely slow start combined with some poor editing(making many passages very dull and repitive) make me feel that this is not Murakami's best, although it is still very good and an amazing accomplishment.

B000F2C87Q|5.0|This cd is a tribute album to Junior Kimbrough who was the biggest inspiration for Dan Auerbach. I bought this album and instantly I understood why the Black Keys sound the way the do. The influence is evident. I've listened to it a lot and its one of my favorites from them. Its a solid blues album with a ton of soul.If your looking for something differnt and new this is a great  pick.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|To be honest this is the first Superhero movie I've watched since Superman 3 I was never much of a comics fan except for Captain America. This movie is fantastic, true to the original story in most ways and adapted great. A must see for Cap fans.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|For my use - this is a great fit.  A decent price on a great processor.  I'm not a gamer or an someone that is likely to overclock, but multi-tasking in my profession is critical.  I've got this CPU paired with 8 gigs of RAM, an SSD drive as my system drive and a western digital caviar black for the data drive.  With the hardware set up listed above, I have been running two virtual machines, compiling large projects in visual studio and with that going on no other tasks even started to slow down.  If you want your computer to do a lot of different things that all require heavy processing at the same time - this is a great chip.  Well worth the money and time to rebuild my system.  My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner.
0439023521|5.0|This book is like vice grips, once it gets a hold of you it wont let go until you've reached the end. This is a fantastic read and absolutely no one should miss out on this. The cast of characters are excellent and it will keep you guessing up until the the plot twist blindsides you like a a freight train. Its excellently written, the pages simply come to life with,and characters you care about and relate to. Don't pass on this read!
B005POK858|4.0|This is just going to be a quick stream-of-conciousness write up as I'm at work and in a hurry.  Well, I picked this up as the \\"free amazon app of the day\\" (or whatever they call it) on 11/16/2011. I got home and started playing and found that I had whiled away a good 3-4 hours playing it. I have a T-Mobile G2x - Rooted and ROMed with Cyanogen RC 7.1.0.1 - this is Nvidia Tegra 2 so I have plenty of horsepower to spare.  I will preface this with the fact that I cut my teeth on the ATARI and played pretty much every game system up through the current ones. I'm sure those that did the same can remember the excitement and mind-melting awesomeness of seeing that new SNES running Super Mario World at their local department store, or any other system for that matter. I do not have any sort of \\"graphic bias\\" and rather take a game on it's own merits, whether it's simply a dot bouncing over other dots, or a photo-realistic eye-candy orgasm.  The game is pleasant to look at for sure. The first time I was engaged in a battle the screen flashed white and cut to a quickly scrolling scene of a field with trees in the back. My character came charging in and slid to a halt before the enemies. It was quite a fetching scene to watch unfold. The backgrounds for the various fights are quite detailed for being \\"8-bit\\" and the enemies are as well. Bright vivid colors and good attention to detail make each enemy that I've encountered so far a treat to look at.  The sound and music becomes somewhat repetitive, ESPECIALLY the menu selection sound (which is also the sound effect for a spell called \\"Search\\" and possibly more I haven't found yet) - that one will grate on you after a little while. The dialogue text (not technically sound) strikes me as either being written by someone who doesn't have English as a first language, or as being translated from another language but not distractingly so; there are just somewhat odd sentence structures here and there.  The gameplay is straightforward.You have a directional control on the left of the screen, and an action button on the right. You can manipulate the game screen by using either the directional pad, or touching what it is you want to manipulate; though I will say I often find myself using both depending on what I am doing. Now, as I said I probably have near 4 hours into it, but I want to point out that I was level 20 before even engaging the first robotic \\"boss\\" character. I did this through judicious use of \\"Meat\\" to increase my enemy encounters and thus have a battle approximately every 1/2 second step. As of this writing (and not playing the game at all today) I am checking my save file and the gameplay is 4:34:17 - Main Guy (Effat?) is Lv35, the girl with the gun (don't recall her name) is Lv34, and the new character I just met is Lv17 (magic using blue-haired Moon girl) - I have only JUST rescued the father I might add.   Use the meat a lot, and check your History for the creatures you kill as some give very very valuable items with what seems like high drop rates. Farm those bad boys and you'll have 400+HP in no time.   Overall, I find the game satisifying, and though the story isn't especially compelling (robots enslave humans, humans revolt, robots disappear but suddenly are appearing) it's enough to keep you curious about what's going to happen next.  GRIPES/WISH LIST: (please understand, these are things I'd like to see. I do understand the concept of technical limitations and such)  I would love to have music specific to an area (i.e. Cave music, Grassland Music, Desert Music) etc  I would like to see different sound effects or have the ability to disable only the sound effects (specifically that damnable menu selection sound) that I want disabled  As I'm sure most people would, it would be awesome to have the armor change as you get new things, same with weapons  This is a personal thing but why do they ALWAYS have to be doing the walking motion? Kinda irksome  The menu systems NEED tobe revamped and made not only more intuitive, but also more ergonomic. Why can't I equip a sword or armor from the Items screen? (it just prompts you to go to the other screen that looks exactly the same) - On top of that, menu inconsistency - you can, when purchasing an item, click down at the bottom to see who it will affect and how - but you cannot do that same thing from within your own Items menu.  I'm sure there might be more, for all I know I'm just right at the beginning of the game even though I've only fought 2-3 bosses so far (yes, I level like crazy, it's a \\"thing.\\")  Thanks for the game, and if you stuck with me this far, thanks for reading!
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I saw a video online that showed a very large wooden puzzle that looked amazing, and I wanted one instantly, which is a feeling that rarely happens for me.  The thing was about 1 meter across so I was hoping there would be a smaller, cheaper version on the market. Here it is, the Epic.  It is truly a beautifully designed product, one in which I can admire almost as much as I enjoy playing with it.  Well, tonight after a month of on-and-off playing, I finally beat the Epic!  The challenges are very rewarding if you enjoy Labyrinth-style games.  I was blown away when I found out about this, and as a man in his 20's, I'm not ashamed to admit that I played this game and loved it!    The build quality is low, which is reflected in the price, so there is definitely a trade off there.  Fortunately my Epic has no broken pieces like some of the other reviewers were complaining about.  I really wish the plastic on the outside was a bit harder because it is pretty easy to bend and potentially crack it.  Nonetheless, if you are careful with it, and assuming there are no broken pieces when it arrives, I think there is no reason why something would break if you handle it gently.  The trouble is, you may not know if something is broken until you get further in the game, which may take a while.  At this price point ($25), it's worth the risk!
0553582038|1.0|I was very taken with the first three books in the series.  You cannot know how disappointed I was in this book after reading those.  I read all of   A Feast for Crows.  At times, I considered not finishing it, but I hoped that it would become as  interesting and enjoyable as the first three books.  I will keep those books in my library but as far as I care, this book can go in the garbage.
B005ER6SNM|1.0|I bought this hoping it to be fully uncut but alas it's missing more than 90 seconds.  The 2 most memorable scenes are heavily cut and especially the second scene doesn't make much sense anymore.  I'm giving this one star because I feel cheated and because it just invites people to download the uncut version.  There are 3 cut versions now of this movie on dvd and it's totally ridiculous.  And on the movie page it says NC-17 while the dvd cover says Unrated.  This is what liars do.  Anyway I might've known that unrated doesn't mean uncut ...
B005DOL0R0|1.0|Fastest I've ever returned a product in my life.  Horrible smell!! Why would anyone want to put their new Kindle Fire into something that is going to make it smell really bad?
0811836363|5.0|Just amazing book. It's a real pleasure to have it, to hold it, to flip through it and, certainly, read it :)  It would be better to me if I ordered a hardcover format, because this book weights almost 3 kilo.

I was not disappointed by the tale, was enthralled and hypnotized by the arrogant, sensitive and astute nature of one human being. Thoroughly enjoyed the journey. Sad to lose him so early.

0307891372|5.0|I ordered this guide on friday 11/11/11, monday was shipped and today, at 1.10PM(in Italy), it arrived at my house with UPS international carrier. It was my first order with amazon, I was quite insecure about the time of delivery and the quality of the product once here and after traveling around the world.. I mean the package got picked up first in Las Vegas and after only 3 days arrived in Italy, here at my house. I'm happy about the purchase of this product, it's a massive guide with every single hint you might look for.   Here in Italy we won't be able to buy this guide in our language because Bethesda is not allowing to make an Italian version, I'm lucky that I can understand english, but what about the others??  Anyway I'm happy because they respected the time of shipping/delivery, eventually in a short period of time.   I think that I will buy something else from Amazon!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|First, let me say I have been a SK fan since 8th grade and have read nearly all of his work. I have always found King's novels much more engaging than his short stories. He has time to create intricate characters who we begin to love, hate, understand. With that said, I was thrilled by the length of this book and total character development. I read the book in a week! I spent a lot of time on the internet fact-checking little tidbits as I read. I have to say I learned many interesting things. It was very brave of Mr. King to undertake such a researched and documented episode of American history. I have recommended this book to many of my friends who read SK as avidly as I do. I loved the ending, which is not always the case with King's stories! The epilogue, as always, was a great look into his reasons for writing this book and the creative process. Highly recommend!!
0143105035|2.0|Just received my copy.<br /><br />Must have skimmed the item description too fast. This is just the novel, with a fancy cover. I thought I was getting a graphic adaptation.<br /><br />There are many less expensive editions available on Amazon. No real reason to buy this one.
0061998494|5.0|I happened to buy this book at the same time I bought the Penn Jillette \\"Go No! ...\\", and the link between the two is how brutally honest the authors are about themselves (or at least seem to be).  The difference is Craig Ferguson is contrite about what he got up to!  As expected, he covers his life from early days in Scotland (his hometown itself an interesting side story) to the books publication.  It included the \\"full version\\" of the stories he has hinted about or glossed over on his Late Night talk show.  He talks about the things that inspired him, both to greatness (like his dream of living in New York) and his failures (the drinking culture of his formative years).  The book has several stand out aspects.  First is the way he blends humor into the story, even into some of the darker sections, to keep the book moving and from become... well... to gloomy.  Some really bad things have happened in his life, worse than most of us will face.    Another is that he is able to \\"explain\\" the crazy logic (often alcohol inspired) that drove many of his decisions that \\"normal\\" people would otherwise not understand.  This is a tricky thing to do.    Lastly, I would like to mention how \\"non-preachy\\" the book was.  Although any reader should be able to draw obvious life lessons about the dangers of alcohol and some of the things Americans take for granted, he does so without specifically condemning.  I particularly liked a section where he talked about addictions - that although he took drugs, he is really \\"just\\" an alcoholic - the drugs were not for a high, they were to let him drink more, or hide it better.    It's hard to call a person who had such a rough time and who lost so much \\"lucky\\", but I think he would be the first to agree.  If you buy the book to learn more about Craig Ferguson, you will end up trying to convince your friends who don't know who he is (and that's most of them, I mean, he is on CBS for Christ's sake) to read the book, because his is an impressive story.   I did buy his fiction story, Between the Bridge and the River, but have not had time to read it except chapter 1 as a teaser, and I am already hooked.

1451627289|5.0|Kindle books should be no more than $9.99 - the recent price hikes are going to kill the e-publishing industry.

B0036T31YY|5.0|I had incredibly low expectations for this film, but in the end, I was amazed.  This story is one I am very familiar with and am always intrigued to see them chose the same road.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I am extremely disappointed in this purchase.  Of Course now the price is cheaper than when I preordered it, but like others describe, the cover is very thin and flimsy and does not support the weight of the kindle very well. The best way to describe this is a black rubber/plastic covered with felt-like material on the inside.  When closed, it will do a decent job protecting the screen from dust, by I don't trust it to protect the kindle if accidently dropped. I bought the kindle as a gift for someone, but I think I'm better off returning the cover and buying a new one.  Amazon should not promote such poor quality accessories to go with a high quality product.  Update: I just went to the post office and mailed it back. Cost me $3 for basic delivery with delivery confirmation.  Will wait for my refund.  One more thing I thought of and I don't know if anyone else had this problem. When I was testing the case I couldn't plug in the charge because the case covered the port hole.  It left enough room for the speakers on the top, but I want to be able to charge the Kindle while leaving it in the case.
0811879631|4.0|I recently received this book as a gift, and I was very, very excited about it.  Overall, it's a worthwhile book and one that you should add to your collection, if you're an 'Art of' kind of person.  It's filled with many great pieces of artwork from the various Pixar wonders of the last 25 years.  My only two caveats:  1) The book contains very few 'never before seen' pieces.  If you already own the other 'Art of' books, it's unlikely you'll see much of anything you haven't seen before.  I was a little disappointed by that.  2) The book claims to have the 'complete colorscripts', but that's not true, a fact that you'll know if you own the other 'Art of' books as well.  Especially in the earlier films, such as Finding Nemo.  The Art of Finding Nemo has dozens of pastels by Ralph Eggleston for the color script.  This book contains almost none of them.  It has what's kind of a color script (and what may have actually been used in the development of the film), but it seems the authors are playing somewhat fast and loose with what they call a 'color script'.  Again, however, it is a beautiful book for display and a great anthology inside.  I'm happy to have it in my collection now and would recommend it to anyone.
1419702238|5.0|Reviewed by Darren (age 10):<br />I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, and this book, Cabin Fever, I thought was the most funny. I don't want to spoil it, but there are very funny jokes in this book. Greg gets trapped in the house during a snow storm and is accused of a crime---which he sort of did. If I were to give this book a rating, 10 being the best, and 1 being the least best, I'd give it a 9.75.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|From the photos, I was expecting a more sturdy case, this feels really cheaply made and not worth the price compared to some of the more economical cases I'm seeing show up now (example the Amazon Basics cover for $25) for the Fire.  The back part is nice, pops on easily and I feel like would protect in case of a short drop or bump, but the front feels really flimsy and doesn't seem to protect much, it's also not real thick for holding onto the Fire open like a book which is what I like about the case I have on my regular Kindle.  I realize the front of the Fire is make with the super durable Gorilla Glass so it shouldn't need a lot of protection, but if you like to feel like you're holding a book-like item while reading, this is not the case for you.  I also expected something from the photos like the Apple smart case for the iPad, this is  not like that either. Just feels like cheap plastic and a very thin felt layer that protects nothing.<br /><br />*Edit*<br />Just saw that Amazon reduced the price of this case by 25% the day after I received it. Between that and all the negative reviews I have decided to return mine, I've found better looking cases for much cheaper by searching on Amazon *outside* of the Kindle store.
B003XT60KO|3.0|This book is definitely dated. The last updates were in the late 1970's. The basics may be sound for the time, but this was long before jobs were outsourced to cheap foreign labor markets. Of course it's written long before the internet, once again where physical location of customers and clients may be half a world apart. Labor does not have the power it did when this was published. This book, in my honest opinion, is a good history lesson on economics and governments, however, is no longer realistic it today's environment. I would recommend reading \\"the World is Flat\\" by Thomas Friedman for a more accurate account of economics in the 21st century.
B000F90312|4.0|A beautiful piece of music that will take you away and will review the movie without turning on the DVD-player
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|So far this case has been great. It fits very well and the hard part of the case that protects the sides and back seems very sturdy. I have lots of gadgets(im a tech guy)and have been through a ton of cases. This one seems very good for the fire. I wasn't sure of the front part cuz i never had a case like this but it works great so far. I take it with me to work where i also have weapon parts in the bag with it and it does a great job protecting it. Im just bummed i preordered it and was 10$ more expensive and then right after all of the preorders ship it went down. A little shady but im not returning the 2 i bought to get the money back.Overall a great case though.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I spent a few weeks reading reviews and debating whether I needed to invest money in this Immersion Box Set. I already have the original LP with all inserts, the remastered CD from 2003 and the Classic Albums Dark Side of the Moon DVD, plus, one of my favorites of all time, the Live in Pompeii DVD, which is the best documentary period.  So, I was a little skeptical about the incremental value of this purchase. After a few days of use, let me tell you I'm very glad I got the box. Why? Here is what you get that is not available anywhere else:  - The Live version of album which is prestinely recorded. It sounds more natural than the original recording, the human element of the performance is right in front of you. No second or third chances for the artists to get the right take. All 4 members playing all the songs at the same time with the little nuances that only appear when they play live. For example, the bass introduction to Money is perfect: raw, crisp, analogue sounding, with a small echo of the venue and whispers of the audience. I was floored how good this version of Money is. When I compared it to the one in \\"Pulse Live\\" or \\"The Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" versions, this take blows them away in terms of the guys being spontaneous and tight. The more recent live recordings loose the raw feeling a little and may come across as overproduced. Time, the Great GiG in the Sky and US and Them, again are presented better, they sound natural and less complicated. The fact that Nick has to play it right the first time shows in his fills, more powerful, more creative, less rehearsed than the studio version. In sum, to me, just the live CD was worth $20. David's voice is more in your face, more powerful vs. other live recordings.  - The books are well made, with heavy, gloss paper. I don't miss or want the stories or lack of commentary that others complain about. The books are subtle, with engaging pictures, to be used quietly while listening to the music. You can buy all the existinig books to read the stories we all have heard. I would have paid another $30 for the books alone.  - The 1972 Alan Parsons mix is uneventful in my opinion, nothing to highlight. It sounds flat, with less dynamic changes and fewer theatrical transients. I'm actually going to put this CD for sale, it just didn't do it for me. I wouldn't pay more than $5 bucks for this CD.  - The DVD's or Blue Ray's are a great alternative for a more modern Floyd version, but I'm a stereo guy and the prefer the original stereo remaster and the live concert. The 5.1 is slowly growing on me so I reserve judgement on that. If I could buy the DVD's separately, I would pay no more than $20.  - Box, packaging and goodies. I must agree with the other reviewers. The scarf, marbles, fake back stage passes and cards are silly, nice to have's, but I would have preferred more in studio pictures, more art, or perhaps a CD with hi rez images. The box itself is nice and well put together. I bought my copy only recently, so the individual CD's came in separate cases. I had no issues with scratching or anything like that. I think the earlier version on the box came with the CD's on bottom with no protection. The box, scarf, cards and marbles are probably worth $10 to me.  In sum, the price for this set is well worth it. The box is a nice way to have all versions in one place, suitable for all media, from redbook CD to hi res blu-ray.   -

140053271X|5.0|Having previously owned a Kindle, I was not expecting that e-book readers had much improved over the last year. Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.  When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.  Amazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently. While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format. The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books. Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to. What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.  I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.

B004JK61K0|3.0|The default mail client on my MyTouch4G dings.  A lot.  It makes me friggin' batty with all of the dinging that it does.  Once it gets a message, it persists in telling me about it until I do something.  It will do this all night long if I don't remember to put the phone on silent.  In addition, the default client periodically deletes all 7 of my e-mail accounts.  These things made me a very unhappy camper and set me to looking for a replacement.    Everything I read said that K-9 mail was the perfect solution to my problem, so I tried it, at the very low price of FREE.  After the great reviews, I was willing to pay for the thing, so the free price was a bonus.  I installed K-9 and set up my 7 accounts and hoped that I was on the road to e-mail nirvana.  Unfortunately, nirvana remains a good distance away.    Things that work:    * I was able to hide the combined mailbox.  I like segregating my email accounts, so see no need for a combined folder to clutter my view.  Some people may want one.  Giving people the option is a good thing.    * It is quicker than the default client, at least with my IMAP account.  Maybe I finally got the account set up correctly, but it works a lot better in K-9 than an in any other client.    Things that don't work, at least for me:  * K-9 can't deal with attachments to messages sent from Outlook unless the message was sent in plain text format.  I am not able to ask my clients and opposing counsel to re-send things in plain text just so that I can read their attachments.  This one failure completely ruins K-9 for me.  However, the developers MAY be addressing this in their next major revision.    * Dogs can't count.  K-9 does a good job of notifying me of new mail, but always has the wrong number of messages in the notification message.  This is a minor niggle, but it is something that they should look at.    * No widgets.  I got really used to the default mail client having a widget for each of my two main accounts with a little number on top of each one telling me how many messages are unread in each one.  K-9 lets you put an icon for each account on your phone, but it doesn't do anything but take you directly to that account.    * It just doesn't feel right.  The default mail client felt natural to use.  K-9 feels like a kludge.    When I discovered that K-9 did not support attachments, I went back to the default mail client for a while, but then realized that I only needed that for attachments, so am using K-9 primarily, with the default client set up to access, but not automatically poll, accounts so that I can get messages with attachments and download them as needed.  Like I said, using K-9 is a kludge.  This whole e-mail problem just makes Android look bad.    UPDATE: When I finished writing my review, Amazon displayed ads for some other products that I might like.  One was Maildroid, which intrigued me.  I read some reviews and decided to give it a try.  It is a great product and I have now paid the $18 for the Pro version (unfortunately, I had to get it from Google, as Amazon does not sell it) and dumped K-9 entirely.  Maildroid \\"feels\\" right.  It took about 30 minutes of tweaking to get it set up exactly how I like it, but that's not bad with 7 email accounts.  Bye bye, K-9.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I'm a huge fan of BBT, and this season did not disappoint. Amy Farrah Fowler is the new addition to the gang, and she is awesome! She's the female version of Sheldon.   Overall, loved this season! Watched it in two sittings...it's that funny.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is a light weight but very sturdy case that also allows you to prop up the Kindle Fire on a table for easy, hands-free viewing.  It only exposes the parts of the Fire that you need access to (speakers, power USB and headphone jack, and the screen.  So it keeps it clean, better protected from drops, and accidental spill/rain.  It is not water proof, but it will help prevent scratches from damaging the Fire case.  I was pleased when  price drop triggered Amazon to automatically send me a $10 refund in the form of a gift certificate.  The lower price make this thin and light weight cover a better deal.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|Why did they package it this way?  A combo of Blue-ray and one \\"regular\\" DVD...with the Special Features Only on a Blue-ray disc?  Why couldn't they have just sold a 2-disc version in \\"regular\\" DVD, with the movie on one disc and the Special Features on the second disc, like they used to?!  If you cannot play Blue-ray there is no way for you to see the Special Features...that is such a disappointment for me, and I am sure, for others.  Pleeaassse...to whomever is in charge...please put out a 2-disc \\"regular\\" DVD version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 1 and then part 2.  OR...could you please put out a 3-disc (or 4-disc) combination package of Both parts, Together, with the Special Features combined onto one disc (or 2 extra discs if necessary), in \\"Regular\\" DVD.  Please, oh, please!!!
014241543X|3.0|I picked up this book after my 14 year old daughter said all her friends were reading it. And overall, I love the theme and the writing is perfect for teens.  But one thing that strikes me over and over while reading this is the amount of foul language by all characters.  The most successful teen reads -- namely the Harry Potter and Twilight series --- do not incorporate the \\"cuss word of the day\\" in any of their novels and they are far more successful.  Also it bothered me that the author is so open about having no beliefs in God.  The character has no value or belief system (and yes, I am a Christian). Angels are mentioned but as more of some odd existential belief of the grandmother. I just wonder if this is a great read for teens after all. Again, the story is something to think about. But I think it could have been so much more without the language and with more of an exploration of true depth of the subject.  It does not make me want to read the follow up novel.
B000002B5L|1.0|The Fugees version of Killing Me Softly starts out with promise, Lauren Hill is a wonderful singer, AND THEN...the awful crappy drum patch starts. It sounds like it was sampled from a Casio kids keyboard found at the Goodwill.  The producer turns it up way too loud in the mix and it overpowers everything, presumably to make it danceable, but who knows? And of course the stupid rapping! Horrendous. Tell you what, lose the Fugees, keep the singer and bring in some REAL musicians like the ones that played on the original Roberta Flack version. In the mean time, just listen to the original, it's 10 times better than this unfortunate exercise in modern faux hipness gone wrong.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was surprised how  much I enjoyed The Hunger Games. Feeling skeptical after reading all the rave reviews, I found myself immediately engrossed in this harrowing post-apocalyptic tale. This book is very hard to put down and I read it in just a few sittings.   I felt sure the subject matter (children being forced to fight to the death) would put me off,  but found just the opposite due to  the author's brilliant writing. The pace is brisk, storyline well thought out and characters intriguing.   I am usually no fan of 1st person narrative but in this instance it added a freshness and immediacy to the tale.    The world building is adequate for the advancement of the plot.   I admired the choice of Katniss as our teenaged heroine. She's resourceful, an accomplished hunter and fiercely loyal to her sister and friend.  Her emotional armour is meant to protect her from all the hurt she's experienced in her short, horrible life.  I like that she's complex and yet confused about her thoughts and feelings.  You can't help wanting her to be the victor of the games.   A very compelling novel.  Well done, Ms. Collins, and I'll certainly continue with the remainder of the trilogy.  Nov. 16, 2011 - edited typo
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I don't really understand all the negative reviews for this case. What do you want a big heavy case with all kinds of pockets and compartments. The big deal about the Kindle Fire is that it is light. This case protects the Kindle all the time because it stays on it while you use it. It is a hard plastic material which is the best for shock and damage protection. It opens easily and you can prop it up with no problem. How would you design it differently? It is the best case on the market and it fits the Kindle well. It may be a little overpriced but custom made things like this are always pricey. It is a great case in my opinion.
B005POK858|2.0|Very Fun game but definitely has some bugs to work out with the Droid X.  This has nothing to do with the ridiculous \\"Get a better phone\\" statements as it's an obvious bug that is causing the issue and it works fine on other phones with lesser specs.  The game plays smooth with no lag/stuttering/etc on the Droid X.  But after about 3-5min of play the sound will glitch out and shut off.  After the sound cuts out the game will continue to play just fine but with no sound.  However, attempting to adjust the sound by pressing the volume buttons on the phone will cause the game to hang and force the phone to reboot.  IF you never press the volume buttons than you can continue to play just fine, or if you notice the sound cut out and you save&exit the game and re-open it than you don't have to worry about your phone rebooting (until the sound cuts off again).  The problem has to do with how the volume buttons work on the droid x.  To go into more detail, there are two different volume levels on the phone (Ringer volume and Media volume).  When you hit the volume buttons on your phone and you do not have any media/games open the Volume bar that pops up on the screen reads \\"Ringer\\" and shows the volume level.  When you have a game/media open and you hit the volume button the volume bar that pops up is suppose to read \\"Media\\" and shows the volume level of the media.  That's where something goes wrong here...After playing the game for a few minutes the sound will cut off and if you attempt to adjust the volume by pressing the volume buttons after the sound has shut off the phone will freeze up and reboot.  Hopefully the devs will become aware of the glitch in their game and fix it, because it plays amazingly well and is very fun as long as you never touch the volume buttons.  I briefly looked for a way to contact the devs to give them some details on how they can re-create this glitch 100% of the time so they could try to fix it, but I don't see any contact info for them...
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I received my item today and called amazon for a price adjustment and they would not give it to me. This overpriced case is being returned asap.  UPDATE:  I actually received an email from amazon that they would credit my account. I opted to keep the case. It is not as bad as everyone has said. I feel it will protect my kindle fire just fine.   I still think it should be priced at 20 dollars or less though.
B0001GMIOE|1.0|I purchased it a month or so ago. After using it twice with no problem at all, I couldn't recharge it anymore! I mean, after normal couple of hour charging, this battery just can't recover. Last time, even, I've tried by leaving it all night long charging(about 12 hours) and I only got to charge it a half of its capacity. Too bad!
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Finally they approved this app for Kindle Fire!  I got this tablet as a gift for my grandma, and the whole point of it was so she could check in and see the latest pictures of her grandson (we have an eye fi card that auto-uploads all of our pictures to picasa).  Since the default gallery on the Kindle Fire does not sync with your google account, I needed an app to do the syncing for me.  This app does everything I want and it does it perfectly.  Auto-downloads the pics, allows slideshows or direct viewing, and is simple to navigate.  Thank you so much!  Again - if you have a Kindle Fire and want to sync it with your Picasa album then this is exactly what you are looking for.
B005VJ8ATS|1.0|I'll try not to use words like \\"self-indulgent\\" and \\"masochistic media\\" when describing ANOTHER EARTH. It will be hard. And apparently, I've already failed. But here goes.<br /><br />Drunk driving high school student kills a child, a pregnant mother, and puts professor husband into a coma. She goes to prison for 4 years. When she emerges, she ends up in a romantic affair with the un-coma'ed widower. Then she tells him who she is. Oh, and there's another Earth in the sky.<br /><br />I'll confess that I went into ANOTHER EARTH expecting to hate it, but just like the proverbial train wreck, I had to see it through to the end. The part about the other Earth struck me as a gimmick. Or something on the order of a question asked by partying college students in the wee small hours. Like \\"if you could be any animal...\\" In this case, the question is \\"if there was another Earth with exact copies of ourselves...\\" Never mind the science. The movie ignored it. No tidal waves, no disruption of planetary orbits. (I have a huge ability to suspend disbelief, but this film really over taxed it!)  And at the end, no thought was given to a VERY important question. To describe it would spoil the ending. If that's possible.<br /><br />I usually like Fox Searchlight films, like Whip It and Waitress. But ANOTHER EARTH is uninspired, obvious, and clearly used the \\"ANOTHER EARTH\\" facet as a ploy to set it apart from other navel gazing fare.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I received this case a day before I received the Kindle Fire and to be honest, I was VERY disappointed. Yes the case is very thin and lightweight (which is what I wanted) but the cover part of it looked really cheap and flimsy. The \\"stand\\" function did not work. I did not have the Kindle inserted so I used my hand to simulate the pressure that would be put on the case and discovered that the cover that folds in half to act as the stand kept slipping out of the \\"notch\\" on the back side. Once I received the Kindle, I tested again and found the same thing happening.  After reading all the reviews and confirming the problem, I was going to return the case but decided to give it another chance. What I discovered was that if you don't 'force' the cover into the notch and just let the Kindle rest on it naturally, it works just fine as a stand. You won't really be able to push on it or use the screen too much but I am just going to use it as a stand to watch videos so I can live with it.   The case itself feels nice in the hand and really doesn't add any noticeable weight to the already heavy Kindle Fire. In fact, it feels better in the hand than just the bare Kindle Fire which feels a little slippery to me. So at $30 (after the $10 price reduction), the case seems a little bit overpriced, but it works the way it was intended and I am going to keep it.

007174889X|5.0|I give Harrison 5 stars based on all the chapters written by experts in their fields, including ME/CFS chapters.  I am still shocked to see people attributing chronic fatigue on the pseudo science of ME/CFS.  I do have 5700 patients in my metabolic office and I treat fatigue as #1 problem and not even once I have used CFS as a diagnostic code. CFS is not even a diagnosis. It just means you have been tired for a long time.  The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of chronic fatigue are extremely deficient on both sides of the Atlantic (USA CDC, UK Nice criteria). By implementing new reference ranges for certain vitamins, nutrients and hormones, including subtle metabolic abnormalities in glucose, mineral  and lipid metabolism, including subtle pituitary-thyroid,  pituitary-adrenal axes, it is absolutely impossible not to uncover the precise diagnosis of chronic fatigue in every patient.  The subtle metabolic/ endocrine/genetic/ nutritional/circadian/ auto-immune diseases I implement in systematic evaluation of chronic fatigue, usually uncovers 99.9% causes of chronic fatigue and I can prove it.  A patient with CFS is a patient who has not been thoroughly evaluated.  EBV infection and other similar viral illnesses do not cause CFS. They cause a short period of post viral fatigue  for 2-3 weeks. EBV antibodies just tell you that you have \\"kissed\\" in the past and it is waste of resource and energy.
1401225756|4.0|I love comics (aka graphic novels) and decided to try this series. I love the colors and graphics and the story is good as well. I've got the next couple of my bedside table.
0307477479|5.0|The book is creative and exceptionally well-written, even though its subject matter is not easy to discern or discipher, in some chapters, and some people have opened and closed it without attempting to understand the message, rather becoming defeated by its style. It is very slow and lyrical in places and staccato in others. \\"Reading\\" the book with an audio version may largely be responsible for that impression.  The reader is very emotional and expressive although she does not throw her voice well, into the different characters, especially the males.<br />The storyline is confusing. The time-line travels all over the place as the characters are introduced, dropped and then reconnected with, at various points in the book, without regard to chronology, as the book travels back and forth over fifty years. It begins with four main characters, members of the Dildos, a musical group, four dysfunctional young adults making poor choices with a lackluster home life, each with a penchant for bending or stretching the rules, each wanting to make their own statement to the world, to define themselves as different, special. We watch as the characters and those they meet, develop, succeed, fall from grace, disgrace themselves, recover and sometimes proceed with normal lives.<br />At first the characters are rebellious. They don't like society as it is and they protest with their music and their behavior. As the book progresses, they mature and change with the exigencies of life. From the days of rebels to the days of middle and old age, many learn to conform, some from necessity and others from desire. From the rowdy, defiance of their youth to the quiet acquiescence of their middle age and beyond, we witness the growth, and sometimes defeat, of the characters and the people with whom they interact. In the end, some years into the future, their progeny are the opposite of the way they were and disabuse foul language and protest. They seem more content and concentrate on keeping the peace, curing the planet and finding themselves, without confrontation.<br />Finally, years later, in 2023, with a concert featuring a bygone instrument, a slide guitar, and a has-been, the book seems to complete its circle. The performance begins with rather benign melodies and lyrics, but later, it descends into the protest of the songs of the once revolutionary musician.<br />Each of the characters carries some baggage with them, from their backgrounds, their personal dysfunction or simply their desire to oppose the \\"powers that be\\". In the end, I believe the message may be that of futility, the futility of protest, of bucking the system, of defiance for the sake of defiance, since in the end we all seek the same thing, quiet, harmony, joy and contentment, progeny, success, health (our own and our planet's), a coming together of disparate people: a blending of purposes which ultimately brings peace.<br />The world is populated with solar and lunar panels, helicopters flying low for security; the world is immersed in a constant hum of motion, so much so, that silence is relished, as one of the teen-aged characters discovers, as he graphs the pauses in music for the beauty of the silence rather than the rhythm and beat of the cacophony that used to be applauded.<br />Eventually, tragedies or victories return all things full circle, to complete the cycle.  As the child of one character is obsessed with musical pauses, yet another is obsessed with the Sasha he once knew and he and Bennie (a  character always obsessed with her) try to find her, but, of course, they can't. They can't go back, although, in the end, everything does return to the beginning, the starting line, and the process commences once again, but, with a different cast of characters playing similar roles, walking in their footsteps. Time moves, we all must move with it.<br />\\"Time is a goon,\\" so says the book, and as time passes, things change: people, seasons, lives, hopes and dreams, plans, nature, climate, the world. Time moves along and takes the non-conformists with it, until they too conform.e moves along and takes the non-conformists with it, until they too conform.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I didn't know what this \\"UltraViolet\\" digital copy meant, and I was disappointed to read the reviews here and other information on the web confirming them - UltraViolet is not a true \\"Digital Copy\\" in the sense I'm used to - you don't own a copy of the movie, you get the right to stream the movie instead.  Major fail!  If I am going to buy a version with a digital copy, I want to be able to add it to my iTunes library, NOT just to stream it with software I'm not already using, and that I really don't want to use.  I think I'll save some money and buy the DVD version and rip it myself.  Thanks reviewers for shedding light on this!
0553062182|2.0|With a professional background in psychology, I find many theoretical and practical problems with this book's concept of a \\"highly sensitive person\\".  First of all, many of the traits mentioned which have to do with neurological sensitivities (uncomfortable with loud noises/bright lights/feel pain more intensely) are symptoms of what is known as Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) or Sensory Integration Disorder-Sensory Defensive variety.  This may or may not be a subcategory of ADD/ADHD.  These problems are suspected to be caused by imbalances in the neurotransmitters of serotonin and dopamine and are often genetic. Secondly, introversion is a completely different trait which is not necessarily related to Sensory Integration Disorder.  Introversion, as described by C.G. Jung is not shyness or fearfulness but rather an innate personality style in processing the \\"world\\".  Introverts need more time to think things through, develop a well-thought out answer before responding to a question or problem.  At the end of a busy day, they prefer to unwind with one other person or a quiet book.  The book \\"The Introvert Advantage\\" describes that those with introverted personalities (as measured by MBTI)are wired differently than extroverted people (those who respond quickly to the outer world and prefer lots of company and verbal input.)  There are many introverted people who are not in the least bit oversensitive to sensory input as suggested by the author.  Likewise, there are many extroverted people who have SPD who need to get away from all stimulation at the end of the day and retreat to a dark/quiet room but due to neurology and not personality style.   I think the author has taken the INFJ personality type as cited by Myers-Briggs via Jung's theories (mostly...save for 30% ENFJs) and sprinkled it with Sensory Processing Disorder and has packaged it as\\"The Highly Sensitive Person\\".   That said, the saving grace is that there is much affirmation and kindness expressed to people who've felt over-sensitive in the world and criticized for it.  I think the author needs to develop this theory better...

This is perfect as it adds little to the overall weight of the device.  It's light, but works perfectly as a stand and a general protective cover for my Fire.  Also, when I purchased it was $39.99.  The price dropped and Amazon credited the difference ($10) to my account.  I thought it was a fair deal at $40 (because of the polycarbonate), but at $30 it's even better.  Definitely consider getting this, I'm glad I did.
0307711773|4.0|This is an interesting book with a good twist on the old Olympian series.    However, this new reader pronounces names from the former series differently and doesn't really have good voices for many of the characters. I understand: new series, new reader.  But come on, can't you get the names the same?  And do you have to make Chiron sound like he's 95?
0307454541|5.0|Really great book. Starts off slow, but the end will totally shock you. Definitely couldn't put it down. Don't wait on your purchase, it could make a great gift for someone too.
B001E45XT4|5.0|This is the second one I've bought. I broke the last pair while moving. Best headphones for the money. Sound quality is good, and they are very comfortable.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautiful puzzle game with stunning graphics and fabulous music. Well worth 99 cents. Runs exceedingly well on my Moto Droid 1.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I absolutely love PvZ! I enjoy the mobile version very much, however I wish the features available on the PC version were afforded to us as well.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|I really enjoyed Matched. It was formulaic as far as YA dystopias go, but it was good. After I finished it, I couldn't wait for the next book!<br />Then Crossed came out and I read it as fast as I could. I can't even say how disappointed I was. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because I found parts of the story interesting. But honestly, nothing really happened. There was no climax or resolution, just one long build-up. It's one of those books that's meant as a filler between the first and the third books. It doesn't have any purpose other than to create a trilogy.<br />I'll read the third book, but if it's not as good or better than the first, I will be seriously upset.
B005POK858|5.0|very entertaining. can't go wrong with this one. specially if its free on the amazon app store. android rules ftw
0679731725|5.0|I have not read all the other reviews; just some of them. They are very accurate in analising the plot and the historical backgrounds, but the ones I've read forget to say one very special little thing.  First, let me say that, of course, there is a socio-political dimension in the book - every good book carries one - but that is not, by far,  the most important thing about it.   But those who perceive the book only by its \\"class struggle\\"* and historical dimensions have fallen, I think, into a subtle trap: Remains of the Day is, indeed, a love story.  ______________________________________________________________________  *It is time we are done with that, isn't it?
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. As a Christian myself, I've had to grin and bear it over a lot of  well-intentioned , but amateurish film dramas that have a Christian message. Not so with Soul Surfer. Well done all around, and a film I would recommend to anyone. To the naysayers who criticize the actress who plays Bethany, I say \\"Why don't you get out there and try to act in what I consider to be a very difficult role?\\" I admire her, and the rest of the cast in this fine production. As soon as the price goes down, I'm going to buy about 10 copies to give out to friends and family.
030746363X|2.0|This book has great ideas that I am using, however I did not appreciate all of the curse words in it. Why not write books without the curse words, they don't make the book and they wouldn't be offensive to anyone.
079070546X|5.0|The funniest christmas comedy ever. This film has something everyone can relate to.The entire family watches it every year together.A great tradition. Try it!
B0055JP7EU|5.0|...\\"When a Good Man Goes to War\\" is probably one of the saddest episodes of Doctor Who through every incarnation, right up there with \\"Earthshock\\" from the original series.  This was indeed the Doctor's darkest day, at first believing they'd rescued Melody from Madam Calvarian, only to realize that the supposed infant was little more than a doll made from the Flesh with a mental beacon initially transmitting from her senses to her brain.  I have to admit that I did cry at the end, especially when the Doctor realized that Melody Pond was the girl from \\"Day of the Moon\\", and that his enemies had already raised her through early childhood, at least.  It explains a lot about River Song's amazing abilities with weaponry, empathy with the Doctor, eccentricity and appearance so different from that of Amy and Rory and her immense intelligence to know the history of her life, from conception as hybrid human/Time Lord to being reared as a living weapon without love or care.  The only thing I'm against is the implied hope that the Doctor would reach Melody before adolescence, which is... well... \\"SPOILERS!\\" going to be cruelly dashed.  Watch \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" next for the conclusion.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|SPOILERS POSSIBLE:<br /><br />This movie (and the book) were an incredible wrap up to an incredible series.  Adults and children alike are touched by and wrapped up in these stories; my husband is by no means a voracious reader (he reads a couple of books a year) but he has read all of these books multiple times and he has almost an encyclopedic knowledge of the world Rowling has created.  And it is just that; a world - the creativity with which she crafts her characters and the landscape and plot around them is almost unparalleled.  I do not think it is excessive praise to compare her stories to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br /><br />In particular one cannot praise her characters too highly.  Her heroes are truly heroic, and there can be few villains in history that can rival Voldemorte.  However, perhaps her best character of all turns out to be Severus Snape.  The depth of the character she creates in Snape, not just in this story but throughout the series, is almost unparalleled.  Snape's story is incredibly complex and she does such an excellent job of hiding the truth until the end.  She manages to take a character that many probably loathed for many years and turn him into almost as much of a hero as the main character(s), which is impressive.<br /><br />I also have to give her kudos for her choices in how to resolve the story; I thought she had just the right amount of carnage, for lack of a better way to put it.  I was afraid she would \\"cop out\\" and not kill any important characters, and I was happy (from a literary perspective) to see that she made the hard choices.  It would not have had the same impact had she chosen to avoid killing any characters we cared about.  In the same vein, I am so glad she had an epilogue; it set just the right tone to get across the message of hope.  As someone else said, it reminds us what was worth fighting for.<br /><br />As for the movie specifically, I thought it was excellent.  The special effects were excellent, as always.  I thought the cast and crew did a phenomenal job on this movie in particular.  I was especially impressed with how well the director (I assume he should get the credit) melded the scenes to show us how Harry and Voldermorte were two sides of the same coin.  He did an excellent job of highlighting just how connected the two were.  The suspense was excellent, as was the way the story flowed.  I have heard complaints about the way the movie started off with action immediately, but honestly Part I and Part II were meant to be treated almost as one movie with an Interlude - if you haven't watched Part I you really need to watch it before this one.  Definitely an excellent wrap up to the series.  Highly recommend.ew did a phenomenal job on this movie in particular.

B005LJK3AC|5.0|This movie absolutely cracked me up.  I watched it twice in one week and I'd watch it again tonight.  Shenanigans.
B005JU5JTI|2.0|For the record, I think that every actor in this film took their parts and played them to the best of their ability. And they succeeded at what they set out to do. They got into their parts and they brought their characters to life. I admire Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Jason Segel, Lucy Punch, and Phyllis Smith, just to name the major ones, for how well they pulled off the parts that were written for them.   Unfortunately, this collection of superb actors were not given much to work with by the writers of this film. I'm not sure if they wrote out a story, so much as they made a list of all of the things they found funny and another list of all the terrible and inappropriate things a person can do and then they tossed them together into what they thought passed as a screenplay. And then, unable to find an ending that made sense with their \\"story,\\" they took an ending from just about every comedy with a romantic subplot (girl and guy hook up; all of the sudden they start acting like better people) and gave it a small twist that isn't so much funny as it is random and confusing.    While there were jokes and moments that were very funny, the movie itself did not fit together. It feels more like a random collection of moments than a film. And those moments don't always work together so well. The plot is disjointed and plots are dropped or explained away so quickly that it's hard to know what's going on. As a collection of sketches, these could work. As a film, they just don't cut it.   The conclusion is much too rushed and unbelievable - even more so than the rest of the film - and nothing is really resolved. This is a movie that I could have skipped.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I am surprised at the reviews of this item.  I received mine and it works great.  As for the stand being flimsy - it's not.  I can push from the top with quite a bit of force and it does not collapse.  I have an IPAD with a cover that folds and it is not as strong as this.  Also, this stands up and I am not afraid of it falling over which is something I am in constant fear of with the IPAD.  As for the price, I just received a message from Amazon saying I am getting it for 10.00 less as the price came down so they are crediting my account.  See for yourself and see how you like it.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|I haven't even seen this movie and I already it is going to be an all time hit. I can't wait to see this movie. I love the part where the friend is about to have sex with his friend's wife and then she takes a dump in the bathroom like a real man.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|okay first of all i bet all of you exctpected throuout the first and second book that katniss was going to kill president snow and she will end up marring petta or gale right. i did that to. another thing i didnt like about the book is that collins had a theme throughout the 1st and2cd books and then all of a suddend who have the charecters acting so wierd. when i finished the last book it was right before i went to bed and i was soooooooooo mad at collins for doing that. i mean that was the worst twist if ever seen happend in all the books ive read. honestly i would of reather seen katniss die then what happend in the end of the book.  i thought the first2 books were so awsome but collins ended it horribly.so all that just to say loved the first2 books they had a strong message but the 3rd was a horrible way to end the series. it just went on and on and on. so horrible way to end the series
0240815807|5.0|Oh man where do I start. This book has been one of the best things that has happened to my career as an engineer. This book is like being devepoed into a Mix Engineer step by step and it has done wonders in creating confidence in my mixes through employing plain and easy to implement processes and ideas that get results. The other big thing about this book is the online resources that come with it. There is a wealth of information online for this book and Mike Senior even makes updates to the book online so you always have the most up to date and correct information. His hands on approach in this book starts from the very beginning by having the reader to deal with first things first like treating your room and proper monitoring so you dont end up defeating yourself at mix down. This is not just a book that gives you a bunch of information that leaves you to put it all together. No, this is a book that walks you step by step into making solid mixes that will stand when pitted against industry standard mixes. If you are an entrpreneur like me then this is music to you ears. Being able to provide commercial grade material in your own home is as lucrative as having a money tree in your backyard. Anyways, Mike Senior begins in his book by saying if you have any questions then please send him an email. Well, I tested his claim on this one and guess what? He actually emailed me back in less than 12hrs, and he even provided me with the contact information to the head honcho of a very major producer of pro audio gear to further get my questions answered. Mike Senior really is the peoples champ. Get this book and study it like your life depends on it, and watch as you get a first class ticket into land of commercial grade mixing. BTW, I have \\"Mixing Conceptes and Practices\\" and I have \\"The Mix Engineers Handbook\\". In my personal experience this book has been more useful than anything else I have read. Again, this book not only gives you superior information and professionalsecrets, but its also like having your own pesonal mentor. Not to mention Mike Senior's availability to answer your questions is an added bonus.
B002SAS26E|5.0|This is a review for the 2 Player card game \\"Jaipur\\". My S.O. is a huge fan of Lost Cities will play L.C. until the cows come home. I love the game, don't get me wrong, but there's isn't as much depth I would like. Enter Jaipur; The exclusively 2 player card game based around trading various goods for various amount of points. There are many more strategic choices that are presented to the player; making it a little bit \\"heavier\\" in terms of gameplay. Please don't confuse the \\"heavier\\" strategy with better; Jaipur is not \\"better\\" than Lost Cities, however i consider it the next logical step in choosing a new game after enjoying Lost Cities.   Rather than walkthrough how the game works, I will instead tell you what we like about it.  Pros:  -GREAT quick 2 Player card game  -Lots of Choices to make  -A little \\"heavier\\" than Lost Cities  -Several different strategies (Camels???)  -Very easy to pick up, but has a hidden level of complexity.   -Superb attention to detail in components that fits in a small travel size box  Cons  -One of the only cons I can think of is the initial setup of the trading chips. But this literally only takes 45 seconds. In order to circumvent this, have one player shuffle the cards while one player prepares the trading chips.   Thanks for reading, I hope this review helps you chose which game to pick. I'd be very willing to answer any questions you may have about the game or this review.   Thanks!  -Erik
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|easy to use. amazing interface for the Kindle Fire. Any fan of GTD will want Evernote. I especially like how quick it is. No time watching spinning icons.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Nice!  I can access my computer from my tablet.  Now, I can do everything from my tablet instead of being stuck at my computer.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Cover is somewhat flimsy and it is overpriced, but what choices do we have now. It will make due until some better comes along.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|Rec is a gem in low budget horror flicks.  Now, after reading several other reviews and how many people complained about the main characters incessant screaming throughout the film, I can only imagine that they must have watched it overdubbed in English.  Being a native Spanish speaker, I was able to watch this film the way it was meant to.  With that said, I can't explain how great the acting is.  I don't want to spoil anything but when the events play out in that building, I felt the terror all those characters felt.  Also, many people will complain about the way the camera shakes, as the entire film is shot through the first person perspective.  It will be jumpy, but not as much as REC2 or even Cloverfield.  But having played first person shooters my entire life I have no problems with watching a film shot this way.  With a running time of an hour and fourteen minutes or so, it's really not much to endure.    Lately, I've been turning towards other countries to get my horror on and this was truly a nice catch.  I haven't seen Quarantine, which was an American remake to REC but whether or not you speak Spanish, this is a great film to watch, IN SPANISH.  So take lessons, date a foreigner, whatever.  Just try and watch this film the way it was meant to be told and you will be rewarded.  Even if you don't speak Spanish, just pretend you're watching an extended Youtube video about something bad that happened in Spain.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This movie was terrific and didn't lose my interest once. The acting, effects and storyline were well done. Thumbs up! Bring on the Avengers!
B0041T4ML4|5.0|I first heard of this book after it got a lot of good press given the awards it won. While often referred to a Steampunk-style novel, I feel the term was probably mis-applied, or at the very least generates the wrong impression. While we are dealing with a post fossil fuel society using alternative technology to survive, this book is so much more than that.<br /><br />The book does a stellar job of creating this new world in the realms of the mind of the reader without holding your hand in the process. From the very beginning we are faced with a variety of unfamiliar terms like the massive megadonts that help run the kink-spring factory or the genehacked creations of the calorie companies. But at the same time, the book slowly reveals what these unfamiliar concepts are while keeping you advancing through the story at a steady yet well thought out pace.<br /><br />The book can be a bit of a challenging read. Beyond the neologisms that litter the book, the story also features a very large cast of characters (with unfamiliar names) that are all important in their own way to the final resolution of the book. Beyond the characters I've already mentioned, we still have to factor in the members of the Thai Environment and Trade Ministries, that each have their own agendas to pursue in his story. But once you get past the initial confusion, the book really flows all on its own and as a reader you can't help but get drawn along into the flow of the narrative.<br /><br />I love how the book tied everything together in the end without needing to arrange some sort of Hollywood-style climax where all characters are in on location. Instead we have this complex juggling of stories where each thread runs the risk of intersecting with all the others in a complex chain of events that I can't even begin to imagine how the author managed to conceptualize all by himself. Thus hats off to him and all that.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|I have been an Il Divo fan since their debut; I have to say this album is their most powerful album. They really bring out their amazing voices and classical style. Their fusion of voices keeps on getting better, this album fascinates me, they show the richness and classical tenor/opera style they posses. The instrumentation is in par as well, they did an amazing job, one of my favorite albums!

B001UV4XIS|1.0|What happened to getting just a plain, regular, good old fashioned DVD? What's with the ultrviolet, digital, etc. etc?  There are people out here who do not want Blue Ray, Ultraviolet, etc. etc.  It would seem the whole idea now is not to supply a good DVD but to try and shove off all the newest \\"garbage\\", electronic  junk, etc., which of course costs more for the consumer and will probably be outdated in a year or so. Then you will have  to buy more of the newest \\"garbage\\".
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|On a recent pilgrimage to Poland, our tour guide from Krakow brought the DVD - Karol: A Man Who Became Pope, and on one of our longer excursions, we watched the movie while traveling by motorcoach.  It was riveting, and excellently done.  Filmed entirely on location in Krakow, Wadowice, and other areas, the movie is incredibly beautiful and artistically filmed. I daresay, a masterpiece.  And hearing our guide say that she felt it was one of the most accurate films on Pope John Paul II that she had seen, we purchased it as soon as we got home for our own library. You won't be disappointed.
0316044938|2.0|Maybe it was the hype that killed it for me, but I tried THREE times to read this book. Long before the movie tie-in. I also gave it out as gifts to a few people, including my mom and none of us actually finished it.<br /><br />I loved the premise, which is why I bought so many copies. Hardback copies at that. :( But the execution really didn't work for me. I wanted to like it, but no dice.<br /><br />I'm not sure what all of these 5-star reviews are about. I guess art really IS amazingly subjective.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It's not a leather case. Let's get that out of the way, shall we?<br /><br />It's a case with a rubber bottom, an elastic band that can be used to hold the cover in place, and a thin cover that can be bent back and placed into an indentation on the back of the case to prop the Kindle Fire up in Landscape mode.<br /><br />Is it the most robust case? No.<br /><br />Is it functional and of nice quality? Yes.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire clips into the case very well, and I feel that it is quite safe in this case. I don't want to go drop testing my Fire, but I think if I had an accident, this case would give it a better than fair chance of surviving with minimal damage.<br /><br />Some reviewers have knocked this case for it's \\"cheap feel.\\" I disagree. I feel it's on-par with the many other cases I've purchased for my smartphones over the years. It's not like an Oberon or even the Kindle 2 or Kindle 3 (aka Kindle Keyboard) case. Those are LEATHER (or pleather/naugahide/etc). But it is nice. It looks clean and impressive.<br /><br />This case works well. I honestly like it. I think if you're looking for a nice synthetic/rubber case, then this one will fit the bill nicely.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This movie is fantastic! Lots of surprising moments and you find yourself trying to figure out each next move. Definitely worth seeing!
B005XOPEOU|5.0|When I first heard that Coldplay had some new stuff coming I was very hopeful, yet warry.  Viva la Vida/Prospekts March was so off the charts amazing; I figured a follow up could not live up to the same delights.  I immediately fell in love with Every Teardrop and Paradise, but I was less in love with some of the other songs I was hearing.  I went ahead and made the purchase anyway out of loyalty to one of my all time favorite bands.  I gave it a chance...it was about two or three times through the whole CD when I fell in love with what was there.  You really need to listen to the whole CD as a whole all the way through.  Several of the songs have really brief (45 sec.) intros that lead into the main song.  As a whole product I can not be more appreciative of the work that the band put into this one.  It is more melodic and less jarring than Viva la Vida.  Now I have to have my Mylo Xyloto fix once a day.  Big time de-stresser!  If you are on the fence, but a Coldplay fan...get it.  It will be worth it and you will be glad you purchased the whole album.  I purchased the album as a download.  Coldplay is a band on the move and always growing and trying new things.  Thanks to Mr. Eno and the whole band for putting out a top product.  This fan was not disappointed at all...I want more!

B003UESJH4|5.0|The most enjoyable period movie that I have seen in some time. Colin Firth was excellent and Geoffery Rush is always a pleasure to watch when he isn't a cliche pirate for Disney.<br /><br />A great film about a fascinating time in history.
B00008O89K|5.0|I love this soundtrack. Definitely one of my most listened to albums over the past year. Very epic sounding. The soundtrack is the most important part of this movie in my opinion.   However, I noticed recently while listening to Holst's The Planets that some parts of this soundtrack kind of remind me of it.
B005L38QHA|4.0|It's light and medium sized as far as mice go. Bigger than the Razer Naga definitely, but still not huge so if you have medium-large hands then you might feel as though it could still be bigger. Still, it's comfortable to use, and it feels sturdy and well constructed. We've been using it here for a few weeks and it's worked perfectly with no issues.  The optical sensor uses a visible red LED rather than an invisible laser.  The lens assembly is recessed which seems to help avoid the problem that many mice have where tiny fibers get stuck to the lens or the edge of the label surrounding the sensor and the optics lock on that and the mouse pointer stops working. That has not happened with this one.  There are numerous buttons which are easily mapped to whatever functions you like in game. For WoW, the integration is done very well making it easy to assign functions to buttons while in-game.  If you're looking for a mouse with a few more buttons than average, and especially for WoW, then this is an option I think you will be quite happy with.  Update: While the mouse continues to work perfectly with WoW, we have been unable to get it to work acceptably with other games. This was most annoying with the Star Wars: The Old Republic beta test weekend over Thanksgiving, where we were unable to find any way to use the extra buttons on the mouse with the game. Apparently the mouse driver does not intercept the type of input that SWTOR is using. You can use the top two buttons on the left side as MOUSE4 and MOUSE5, but you can't even reassign which buttons on the mouse have these functions as far as we could tell. I would  verify that this mouse will work with your desired games before purchasing it.  UpdateUpdate (12/30): A workaround has been discovered to get the mouse working completely in SWTOR. The problem turned out to be that SWTOR runs with admin privileges and so the non-privileged mouse driver does not have permission to feed keystrokes to it. If you open up the folder containing the Steelseries mouse software, there will be three executables (WoWMGUI, WoWMHID, WoWMTray). Right click each one and select properties and in the compatibility tab set them all to run as administrator. Then reboot the computer. When you reboot you will get prompted for permission to run the driver as administrator. Now you can set up a mouse profile for SWTOR using the out-of-game Steeelseries mouse configurator. Set it to disable in-game mode (checkbox) and then you can configure each button with a NO DELAY macro that sends, say, CTRL+SHIFT+1 for the first button, CTRL+SHIFT+2 for the second button and so forth. Then you can simply bind the buttons to functions in the game by just clicking the appropriate button when setting up the key binds.  G.

B005I6EVUG|1.0|This cover does fit the Kindle Fire BUT WILL NOT CLOSE all the way...so you do not have protection of the KF inside the cover.  It is a very tight fit to get it in.  The cover itself is well made.  I absolutely loved the outside of the cover but don't waste your money unless you live in a hermatically sealed bubble with no dust or debris!  I'd give this zero stars if I could!  It has a magnetic closure that is GREAT...only problem is, once the Kindle is inserted in the jacket...it still sticks open about an inch.  Magnet is useless!  It went back today!
B001H4R4LQ|3.0|\\"Brisingr\\" is the third book in \\"The Inheritance Cycle\\", and in some regards I enjoyed it more than the previous two books because it seems like there is some hope for Eragon in his upcoming battle against Murtagh and King Galbatorix.  The story did seem to drag at times dealing with Dwarven politics, Roran's rise in the Varden, etc.<br /><br />I liked that this book delved deeper into Eragon's character as he questions his theological beliefs, he explores his thoughts on judging others, he learns more about his family line, and he engages in a short quest to obtain a sword worthy of a Dragon Rider!<br /><br />Overall, the Eragon books take a lot from other works (e.g., Lord of the Rings, The Earthsea Cycle, etc.), but I find them enjoyable.  They present good, clean epic fantasy for young adult readers.

B005IZLPKQ|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever forced myself to sit through.  While the \\"diesel punk\\" styling was quite fun, the plot and acting were terrible.  Boring, Boring, Boring.  Long dull scenes interspersed with mediocre action and some of the cheesiest dialogue I've heard in ages.  Save yourself a few bucks and just watch the trailers.  As a long time Capt. fan since the 60's I was severely disappointed.
B000KIPT30|4.0|I like it.It is helpfull and its price is good.It is very good for using many headphones ,but if you want to mix sounds put the headphone direct to the sound card.I will give it 7 out of 10
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Great game. I'm waiting with great anticipation for more levels. It's nice to feel like you have time to think about your moves rather than racing the clock. Very fun. I have to admit that the puzzles at the end of each were pretty challenging so I consulted the tiny bite facebook page for hints. Please add more levels soon!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I just received my cover and I have to say that it took me a while to figure out how to use the stand.  Once I'd looked at the photos on amazon.com it was a \\"palm slap on the forehead\\" moment.  The price was lowered and is just about right for what I'm getting.  It's definitely not a 5-star, but absolutely fine.  We'll just have to see how the stand holds up.  I have the pink cover which I am hoping will discourage borrowing or purloining from male geeks.
6302477751|5.0|I showed this movie to my 8 and 6 year old for halloween. I vaguely remember this movie from when I wad a kid but I did remember liking it.  Really short but was good Cuz it was a school night and the kids loved it. My 6I year old cried and we had to reassure her that Frankenweenie was ok. she now watches it in her room...I guess she's over it now ;-) Wish it was a dvd but what can one expect since its an old movie .
B005OGYH90|2.0|This had been promoted as Slash's first solo live DVD.  All the DVD has is 5 songs out of 21.  On Slash's own web site it says the full concert will be on the CD and the DVD plus the DVD will contain 5 bonus videos and interviews.  I was so disappointed to find that was not the case.  This is just a live CD with a DVD that has similar material to what is found on his deluxe solo album DVD.  I already own all these songs.  I didn't want to buy a live CD.  I wanted a live DVD.  I was really looking forward to this arriving in the mail.  I am so disappointed in the misrepresentation of what was going to be released.  The CD quality is pretty good though.  You get all the crowd interaction between songs.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Got here quick. Love this movie, great condition. Absolutely no problems and my kids loved it too. Makes me happy to show them movies they've never heard of.
B000002WMH|5.0|Elvis/The Complete 50's masters (The 1992 Box Set):  Elvis had a lot of hits after the 1950's but this is where Elvis' best work is found.  If Elvis is the King of Rock n Roll, this box set is his crown.  This 1992 box includes a book (apparently, the Slipcase version does not).  I Highly Recommend this set.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|What a load! the Ultraviolet Digital Copy not only requires you to sign up on 2 web sites, It dosen't work and the tech support is all canned responses, no more help than the incorrect package insert. I tried it from 4 computers, XP, Vista and Windows 7. Signed up on both websites and tried to get tech support from both sites.Neither web site was in·tu·i·tive at all. I will not purchase anything with the Ultraviolet Digital Copy.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is excellent, I just wish there were more levels. The up side is, my productivity (at work and home) went way up once I had beaten all the levels.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I am happy with my purchase from Amazon.  The backpack is good enough to hold DSLR, lens and accessories.  It is built sturdy and the foaming pad is easy on a back.  I carry it to anywhere I go.  It is a real good deal from amazon.
B0002234LS|5.0|Secret Window is a thriller that keeps you guessing. One moment you think that one thing is for sure going to happen but at drop of a hat, it completely changes. When I watch it I still keeps me guessing ,keeps you on edge the entire time. Johnny Depp did an excellent job in it.

B003L77G06|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite TV shows and I'm glad that it came out on dvd so quickly after the season ended.  It is one of those shows that doesn't try to hard to be funny, but makes light of the humor of the everyday family life.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|After waiting the better part of a decade for a decent X-men movie, I'm very glad to see this series return to grace.  Providing several memorable action sequences and characters that I (surprisingly) actually like, X-men First Class is my top contender for best movie of 2011.  I really enjoyed how the movie fleshes out the characters that we're used to seeing at older ages.  The plot also incorporates very well to the time in which it takes place.  I would highly recommend this one to any action/X-men fan.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I just wanted the movie as I have all the others so of course I wanted to complete the set.  I dont really understand the option they give for the Ultra Violet Version or whatever its called, but Hey if you dont want it dont buy it, I do agree, they shouldnt advertise this as digital when they mean they want to sell you more stuff or services for a fee.  But DVD is technically digital,but it should be able to download to Itunes like other movies. However, I really enjoyed the movie.
1451629184|5.0|I expected Jaycee Dugard to tell a riveting story. I did not expect her to tell it with such skill or subtle insight. But that's exactly what she did. Her childhood journals and the journals she kept throughout her captivity revealed that she always felt an affinity for writing, and it shows. This is a frank, honest, brilliantly rendered, expertly executed work of autobiographical nonfiction. That someone could endure what she endured and then transform it into such a thing of beauty and inspiration is truly shocking to me. Her book, her account, her life, her insights - transcendent. Divine. Highly recommended.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This has been my default keyboard for a while. It learns your typing style and predicts what you will say next to help you type faster which definitely helps.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This game is very well done in all respects. Great graphics, responsive controls and nice SFX make for a great pinball experience. What I don't like is how hard the Dev pushes you to buy the full version. A good quality game like this should easily sell itself.
B00164GDD2|1.0|I have to agree with that others that the transfer to blu-ray was very poorly done! Actually, my VHS tape displays more clearly than this blu-ray. Of course, the movie is fantastic, but on this media, it's not worth the money. I'm going to have to get the DVD version, if I can find one.
0553386794|1.0|Terrible, worst book I've ever read. No likeable characters, it makes you not care who wins or loses, who lives or dies. The battle scenes are terribly written. A ten thousand man battle and one of the main events was summed up in a few lines by a woman who \\"closed her eyes and listened to the sounds\\" so you have a few phrases like \\"a man's boot sloshing through shallow water\\" summing up the battle. The plot and characters are sickening.<br /><br />I want my money back, but worse, I want my time and the part of my soul that got leeched away by this drivel back.<br /><br />So glad I didn't throw money away on the 4 book set.
B000JML7EC|5.0|What can you say... This book is a classic for a reason!  It's a great read.  It amazes me how much our current ideas about pirates are based on the characters in this book.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|I read this for a Seminar in Fiction class. Unlike some of the other books I've read for this class, this one I've enjoyed.  I'm conflicted about what rating to give this book, however. For me, the ending was not satisfying. I won't go into details, because I hate to spoiler, but that hurt an otherwise really great story, for me anyway.  This is a novel made of short stories, which is an interesting concept. At first I was a little put off by the changing writing style and point of view, but I quickly became accustomed to it. I think the writer was trying to make sure each story had its own voice, because it came from a different character, and honestly I can't think of any other way it could have worked. It did hang together well and really made sense once you got into it.  I loved some of the characters, and wasn't too fond of some of the others, as was probably the intention. Perhaps what I liked most about this book was that it dealt with deep themes without making a show of it. There's a chapter near the end, done entirely as a powerpoint presentation 'journal,' that the reader might feel inclined to skip over it, but I'll warn you that you shouldn't or you'll miss out.  Would I have read it on my own? Probably not. Am I glad I read it? Yes. If I had half stars to give I think it'd be 3.5, but it just can't get that extra half from me to bump it up to 4 because of the ending.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I'm not a professional book review. I will say it was a great read. Alot of it was dry because I was familiar with alot of it already. I wish it would have delved into his personal life a bit more since it is supposed to be his biography.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|These videos are the watered-down generic versions.  Fans of the series likely have these already, and if not, a little looking can net you all 8 of these for a slightly cheaper price.  Much like the Lord of the Rings extended version, the upcoming Harry Potter Complete extended edition will not only pack in a few scenes that were cut from the movies in the interest of time, but are purported to add cohesion to the films, and a slightly more depth the the characters.  Either way, you can save money by purchasing the discs separately, or wait a bit a get the upcoming extended version. (I recommend the latter.)
1594744769|4.0|This was a very clever story.  The way the author put together a story to got along with these photos was amazing.  The story kept me interested the whole way through.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|a large part of why i bought the kindle fire was to have evernote on a tablet, and it has exceeded my expectations.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Looks classic and the price is right at Amazon. The watch looks good and definitely to have one. Also the shipment was quick and safe.
1572816295|5.0|This is a gorgeous deck with very unique artistic images in a New Orleans type of style. I love them and look at them often. I think it would be impossible for me to do a reading with them because there is so much going on in each card. More of a collectible art deck than a reading deck in my opinion. Well worth adding to your collection.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I'm not at all surprised at all of the hate and hype that has surrounded his recording since before it even was even released.  The biggest problem is Metallica fans will be disappointed by the Lou Reed influence and vice versa.  If you listen to this with an open mind, it is actually very good.  Don't expect normal Metallica and don't expect normal (!) Lou Reed.  This is a colaboration.  A merging of ideas and artistic impression.  It's not for everyone, all of the time.  If I'm in the mood for \\"Kill Em All\\", I won't be listening to this.  Nor would I listen to it if I feel like some classic glam rock.  There is a time and sudience for this tyoe of recording.  I'm just not sure that it is your average heavy metal fan.  Hopefully it will find a new, different audience.  I respect both artists for taking the chance here.  I have always appreciated Metallica for taking chances.  It's so easy to stick to the same formula of music and continue to be successful.  Metallica balances their classic sound with occasional moves towards a different expression.  They know by this point that it will be controversial, but they still do what they feel is right.  Metallica fans are some of the most judgemental and critical out there.  Hell, they couldn't even cut their hair without causing a scandal.  I really hope people will give this a chance, but even if they don't, I hope Metallica and Lou Reed will continue to take chances in the name of art.  Be it together or seperately.

B004MYFV0O|5.0|I have searched relentlessly for a book to teach me how to draw in a fast and fun way. I honestly did not believe it existed and was almost convinced that drawing well was for those born with the gift. This book changed my mind, my skill, and my life! I now can draw and it is absolutely wonderful! Thank you to the author you are my new hero!
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Excellent product and works perfectly. The packaging was also very good and keeps the product in good shape from any dmages.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|To start, I got this movie 3 days BEFORE the estimated date. It works perfectly. I watched it with my girlfriend who has an EXTREMELY vivid imagination. It was a great time for the both of us. I reccomend this to anyone just looking to scare someone else.
0385344325|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book more in a long time.  I can't wait for the next book. (or the movie)  This book is a 10 out of 10.  I'm mad that I finished it so quick.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I like that this cover is not bulky and fits the Kindle Fire snuggly. It would be absolutely awesome if the back flap would stay in when you prop it up.  It stays in place if you don't touch the device. Once you start scrolling or touching menus it is prone to fall down. :( It is a good case but $29.99 is too much to pay for it. In hind sight I wouldn't pay more than $12 bucks for it.  I am enjoying the Kindle immensely though. I give it 3 stars. 4 if it worked properly and 5 if it was cheaper and could stand horizontally. I have only seen one other case that can do that though.<br /><br />Update: I really do like this case. I'm up grading it to a 4 star. I read the negative reviews and I just don't agree with them.  The front flap is not flimsy or cheaply made.  It is supposed to be thin and light weight and not add bulk. It does that and protects the screen very well. I have been looking for another case that would not add bulk and protect.  I think I would buy this one again. I still wish it was cheaper, but I would pay $19.99 for it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Better and  more reliable than a standard alarm clock!  I love that I'm able to customize my ringtone.  I've never had a problem with it - no forced closes.  I am using it on a Thunderbolt.
B004SRNH10|1.0|As soon as I installed it on my phone all my other apps starting acting buggy. I'm not sure what this app does but I thought it would make my Flash dependent apps work better. No so! I uninstalled very quickly to restore the stableness of my phone.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Arrived on time, but I'm somewhat disappointed. The stand-up feature isn't workable because it's too flexible, so know that it's only a cover.  But it does protect the screen when closed and the appearance is simple and clean.  Would not purchase this again.  Did receive a $10.00 credit from Amazon toward my next purchase - I'll assume they mean the next Kindle Fire Stand-up Shell.
0385512104|3.0|Once, I went to the library and took out a 5-CD audiobook version of Stephen Hawking's \\"A Brief History of Time.\\" I was in a distance relationship at the time and needed something to sop up the long weekend drives; I also like sciencey, physicsy stuff and figured this would be a nice, intellectual listen.  The problem: the book was narrated by the author.  Picture 15-16 hours of Stephen Hawking. He knows what he's talking about and he can write, but the neutral, robotic voice eventually overpowers you. Without the usual cadence of human voice, without the usual inflection, tone, emotion, or any of the other subtle tricks we use when speaking to each other, the speaker bores the hell out of you before you've gotten very far.  So it is with Curious Incident. Christopher is a very frustrating narrator - he is difficult to relate to, he is oblivious to how other characters feel, and he doesn't write well. Some chapters read like a worksheet on Sentence Variety; others have no discernible relation to the plot; still others connect, but it's a stretch (\\"I think that prime numbers are like life\\" - like, really?). It's hard to read sometimes, and you may find yourselves getting annoyed with Christopher and his seeming unwillingness to see things from the NT point of view.  Here's the thing, though: the annoying, monotonous, distant-sounding narration is a big chunk of the point. You get to the point where you're thinking \\"OK, OK, I freaking GET IT, you think differently, I GET IT I GET IT, can we just write NORMALLY NOW?!\\" amidst screaming and ripping at your hair - and, well, no. He can't start doing it normally now. However annoying it is for you the reader, this is just how it is for him.  Also, look at the people in his life, mainly his family. The traits that make him a hard narrator to follow for 200+ pages are the same traits that lead certain characters in the book to rash, morally questionable action. Would we really be able to understand, for instance, the father's temper if we narrated this in 3rd person? I think not. It's not a book about who killed the dog at all - it's about what terrible stress and hardship a condition like this can cause.  PROS:  -It's not a typical sunshiny YA book - the main characters, most of them in fact, are kind of miserable people. I'm not even talking about Christopher, either. Kind of a con, too, but there it is.  -Christopher's narration style gives Haddon an interesting way to mislead us. You can rarely tell what any character actually sounds like, for instance, since Chris doesn't pick up on tone - if you reread certain scenes, knowing more about what's really happening, you realize that it sounds different, that people may not sound quite so sad or quite so neutral as you assumed the first time  CONS:  -It is a tedious read at times
B005COO1X6|3.0|The story just felt like it was missing something.  I'm not new to King at all and I like most if not all of his work.  This one just missed the mark in a way I can't quite put my finger on.  It felt like a lot of build up, a lot of time spent in the beginning describing the day of a young boy who really turned out to be insignificant to the story.  King could have really fleshed out the \\"horror\\" portion of the story, could still have brought Pete in at the end in a logical way with just a few sentences backstory and it would have been fine.  Instead we get a huge build up to a quick and deflated ending.  So quick in fact that you're left with the impression that he had no real ending in mind but had to finish it somehow.  Some call this a short story some a novelette, either way it's a quick read. It'll kill time if you have half an hour or so but don't expect too much beyond that.
B005HS00NW|5.0|The artist biography on Amazon's M83 page devotes considerable space to Hurry Up We're Dreaming, and it's bursting with high praise. With that in mind, I wasn't entirely surprised to see that the biography was provided by M83 or their representative. So, I took the biography's lofty praise for Hurry Up We're Dreaming with a grain of salt when I ordered my copy of the album; I figured that it had to be hyperbole and self-promotion to some degree.<br /><br />Now that I've listened to Hurry Up We're Dreaming many times over the last several weeks, it's clear that my skepticism was unwarranted. Two discs filled with inspiring, top-tier M83 magic without fat or album-filler tracks. In my opinion, this double album is consistently stronger from start to finish than Saturdays=Youth. I recommend Hurry Up We're Dreaming very highly to anyone who likes previous M83 material, and to anyone whose only reference points are the 30-second previews on Amazon. Rest assured, if you like those snippets, you'll love the complete album!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is awesome!  This is a great place to keep your ideas in one place. I love the fact that everything is in one place. If you work on the computer or your phone it is all in one place.

A company can be sustainable if the product designers are involved in managing the company and the company is product focused and not only profit focused.  A brilliant insight by Jobs who lived it and demonstrated that it was true.  The rest of the book described his development to the point where he could both articulate and demonstrate this insight.
0380820846|2.0|I've read the series in order, and recently went back and re-read them. I began this book with an anticipation of a great story, it was a huge let-down. I don't remember why I kept this book, maybe to keep the series intact, who knows? But I know I don't like Penelope or Colin in this book at all. Colin seemed whiny and had an insane need to have Penelope's approval in EVERYTHING! And Penelope, okay yeah I get she's a spinster, firmly on the shelf, got it, even though it was POUNDED in our heads pretty much every chapter up until the proposal. I didn't get how she was Lady Whisteldown, it seemed a bit far-fetched and the explanation was neatly tied up with a bow. It didn't make sense. I guess it was to throw interest on Penelope, because otherwise she would be a pretty boring character without that tidbit of info on her. I didn't like how Penelope kept defending her actions as Lady Whisteldown, saying she didn't want Cressida Twombley to be Mrs. Whistledown, but at the same time didn't want to take claim herself. I didn't like how the Bridgertons had to do it for her, as if she's a helpless little ole female who can't take care of herself. She made the mess, she should have been the one to clean it up. It all seemed like she shouldn't have been a 28 year old Spinster, rather she should have been a scared little 16 year old girl. I didn't like the main characters in their book but I loved Lady Danbury and most of the secondary characters in this book.
B00008R9KF|5.0|I bought this movie for daniel day lewis, then found the story way more interesting than the title would suggest.  at several point in the movie i had to stop and go back over what i just watched, i was very surprised, but then movies coming from England and Europe have a more open sensibility than those in the US.  Even though I have had the vhs before the dvd, i will not part with either, and watch in often.  the character Johnny & Omar compliment each other, and i found my self hoping that in the world of fiction they are still together.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|Johnny has got his growl back and he sounds great! As fans we cannot expect him to sound like a young man forever. The song choices are really good and his guitar playing is strong. And most pleasing, all tracks (except one) don't fade out. Nothing like a powerful ending to a song. I can't wait for the next album; please release it soon.
0375507256|5.0|This was an excellent read. The author has done his homework on history and culture, all while creating extremely believable characters, while splitting the action across different time periods. Notable is his use of different genres for each time period, adhering to that specific genre's conventions. Compelling story and characters make this the best book I've read this year.
0765367297|5.0|Eric Nylund is such an incredible writer! The story is interesting and chilling as Nylund takes the reader deep into the history of the Halo Universe. There is no question that XBOX Halo fans will enjoy this novel most. But even a skeptic will enjoy this book. Enjoy!
1451627289|3.0|The first part is compulsively readable. When he gets to Texas, the novel drags (in my opinion) until he finally hunts down Oswald. It picks up near the end. The bottom line is, the middle is slow.
B005DOKIYG|2.0|Received this item yesterday, unfortunately I am still waiting on the Kindle Fire I pre-ordered with it last month, so I haven't been able to pair it up yet. But just by itself, I was a little disappointed when I opened it knowing what I paid for it. The Sleeve looks like it should be priced at about $9.99, it is very thin and provides the most minimal protection. I read some reviews about the smell, I didn't notice it at first with mine, but yeah, if I stick my nose right up to it, there is a chemical smell, but holding it a normal distance I can't smell anything offensive. I am debating whether or not to return it because it does seem very overpriced for what you get.
0307463745|5.0|A book written by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs, and they get it right. I thoroughly enjoyed their take on business that's practical and actionable. Rework is one of my favorite business books in the last few years.<br /><br />If you're part of a smaller enterprise -- say under 100 employees -- this book is for you. You might want to take a look at their products, too. 39 Signals has some great Web-based tools for small and large companies.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|This is The Best CD, Album, Audio download, whatever you want to call it that I have purchased... probably ever.  David's voice is both inspiring and haunting and every song has a hook. Like other reviewers, I can't stop listening to it.  This CD even threatens my Christmas music marathon that would usually begin soon. I go through most days with one of these songs running through my head. Every song is great, the flow of songs and their messages ... Masterpiece.  There is never a good place to stop listening to this CD because the last song ends the same way the CD begins which not only brings this musical journey full circle, on repeat the CD just flows back into itself...much like the meaning of Circadian . . . MASTERPIECE!!
B005HYNCTK|5.0|Sergiu Celibidache's Bruckner is like no other.  Some want no part of it, to them it is just wrong.  True, in his quest to find the heart of the music, Celi often slowed the tempo, and this could be extreme.  Celibidache was a follower of Furtwangler in believing in the organic experience of live performance over the recording studio, and he also followed Furtwangler in viewing a composition as a living whole, and in seeing tempo as flexible, at the service of the whole rather than dictating it.<br /><br /> Celi led the Munich Philharmonic for 13 years, from 1982 to 1995, and the live Bruckner performances collected here span that entire range, selected as some of the best of a large number of recordings.  After reading Celi's 8th called \\"the single best recording of anything ever made,\\" I decided to see what could possibly attract that level of praise.  What I found was practically unbelievable in its sound quality, power, and spiritual effect.  (I find it fascinating that Celibidache and his Zen connected so strongly with the devout Catholic Bruckner -- there is a basic spirituality that transcends the particulars of doctrine.)  The next of these recordings I heard was the 4th, and it too captured something out of the ordinary.  So I took the leap and bought this entire set, thinking I might kick myself if it went out-of-print before I could decide.<br /><br /> Over this time of hearing more and more of Celi's Bruckner, I have heard other versions of Bruckner as well.  Jochum, Wand, Harnoncourt, Bohm's 4th, Sinopoli's 5th, Klemperer and Gielen's 6ths, Boulez and Gielen's 8ths, -- there are many superb recordings.  I wouldn't recommend Celi's Bruckner as the ONLY Bruckner.  But if you haven't heard it, you are missing something spectacular.<br /><br /> Few, I suspect, will take the word of a few potentially demented reviewers, in the face of much hostile opposition.  So I suggest you try my approach -- sample the 8th first.  If you are unmoved, so be it.  But if it has the same effect on you it has on me, I'm warning you that this set may be next...<br /><br />(I bought [[ASIN:B0000246CT the original 8-jewel case/12-disc box]] several years ago -- this reissue is a Brilliant-style true box with no jewel cases, which will fit much better on your CD rack.)has the same effect on you it has on me, I'm warning you that this set may be next...<br /><br />(I bought [[ASIN:B0000246CT the original 8-jewel case/12-disc box]] several years ago -- this reissue is a Brilliant-style true box with no jewel cases, which will fit much better on your CD rack.)

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I absolutely love this box set. And not just because I've adored these movies since i was a kid. Foremost the picture looks absolutely amazing! And i mean amazing. I had a friend over and the first thing he said was \\"Wow that is a really sharp picture\\". And unlike most movies this is not just a rehash. There are a ton of touch ups they did in all the movies: adding additional background action and graphics, all the ships are enhanced to look better than ever, and they even took the terrible Yoda puppet out of episode 1 and made him computer generated. And the extras are actually interesting for a change! Their are numerous actual documentaries about all sorts of things and a whole lot of concept art n such, if your interested in that sort of thing. Don't listen to the sticklers who complain these aren't the theatrical versions. The picture is amazing, the sound is uber clear (surround sound is just amazing\\" and this is the best collection of movies around. If you want to justify that BluRay and 1080p TV you have there is not a better choice than this.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|When I first heard that they were coming out with another The Thing, I got incredibly upset because I thought it was just another remake. Well, it turned out it is a prequel to a remake, the 1982 version. I still was skeptical about a prequel of a movie from almost 30 years ago. Surprisingly I was blow away by the little things that were thrown into the 2011 prequel which linked to the 1982 version. Little things like the ax in the wall that Kurt Russell sees when he first visits the Norwegian base, the burnt Thing outside the base as well as so many other little similarities which perfectly link the two movies. It was very well done and completely took me off guard as I expected this to be a quick slasher remake just to make cash for Universal.<br /><br />They did a great job of respecting the original work and perfectly blending the end of this film into the beginning of the 1982 version of The Thing with Kurt Russell. Make sure you stay for the credits as little clips connect to the start of the 1982 version.<br /><br />Yes, The Thing alien was pretty much all CGI, however they did a really good job of it and some things actually surprised me how well they did it and how far they took it. The cast and acting was perfect and felt right throughout the film. Yes, it lacked some character development, however they used fear and the casts' reactions as a solid character introduction.<br /><br />Nothing will ever top the 1982 version of The Thing, however this 2011 version of The Thing is a perfect Prequel to that and I could not have asked for a better horror flick. One recommendation I have is that if you see the 2011 The Thing in theaters or watch it at home on Blu, make sure to clear your schedule and watch the 2011 version and the 1982 version back to back. You will be quite surprised by the similarities and the amazing level of detail to each and every scene. The makers of the 2011 The Thing must be huge fans of the 1982 version as they made a perfect prequel to such an amazing film.<br /><br />Video<br /><br />Video codec: TBA<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Audio<br /><br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />French (Canada): DTS 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />French (Canada): DTS 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1 (less)<br /><br />Subtitles<br /><br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br />English SDH, French, Spanish (less)<br /><br />Discs<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Two-disc set (1 BD, 1 DVD)<br />UV digital copy<br />DVD copy<br />Mobile features<br /><br />Playback<br />Region A (B, C untested)o  Video codec: TBA  Video resolution: 1080p  Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1  Audio  English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1  English: Dolby Digital 2.0  French (Canada): DTS 5.1  Spanish: DTS 5.1   English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1  English: Dolby Digital 2.0  French (Canada): DTS 5.1  Spanish: DTS 5.1 (less)   Subtitles  English SDH, French, Spanish   English SDH, French, Spanish (less)   Discs  50GB Blu-ray Disc  Two-disc set (1 BD, 1 DVD)  UV digital copy  DVD copy  Mobile features  Playback  Region A (B, C untested)
B005DMNS4A|5.0|Taking into account all that has been said here and elsewhere about this reissue, I agree with the positives more than the negatives.  The new remaster absolutely sounds cleaner to me than any other version of Quadrophenia, particularly the bass and drums.  Yes, the guitars and keyboards are not as prominent, but that may be partially because the rhythm section was never this clear before.  I have to hope that since Pete signed off on this, it's the way he envisioned it.  After all, his instruments are the ones seemingly lower in the mix.    As for not using the original vinyl mix as originally announced, there's a post on Amazon UK's page for this item which states that Jon Astley, who coordinated the remaster, found those tapes to be sonically unacceptable when compared to the 1996 CD masters.  The decision was therefore made to polish the latter for the re-release.  I leave it to others to debate the technical aspects of this.

B004EPYZZI|5.0|This movie is a true story about a teenage girl who was a competitive surfer in Hawaii.  One day while training, she was attacked by a shark, and lost one of her arms.  I bought this for my kids because they had read about the accident when it happened, and knew that Bethany Hamilton and her family had given the glory of her recovery to God.  The producers did a wonderful job and conveying this story.  It does not move slow, and is not too \\"cheesy\\".  I like movies that come with both a blue-ray and a regular DVD because then the kids can watch it on any tv in our house.  I was surprised how many Hollywood stars were in the movie, since it does have a Christian message.  This is one the whole family can enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book really makes an impact.  The reason why some people don't like it is because it leaves them feeling a bit empty inside.  I'm no different; I definitely felt a little empty and numb after finishing this book.  And that's the point!  Sometimes, a book (or movie) comes along that breaks away from the fairy tales and presents reality.<br /><br />This trilogy started out as a love story from my point of view.  Then it transformed into a revolutionary story, but I still kept my hopes that love would find Katniss' heart in the end.  And then I read the third book.  While reading, I realized that the characters were too far gone--too damaged to ever hope to return to a normal life.<br /><br />I think this ended in the best way possible, without having the characters make an unrealistic turn for the better.  I just don't think this could have ended in any other way.  Once I'm given what I wanted all along at the end, it's not as satisfying as I'd hoped it would be.  Once again...that's the point.<br /><br />I LOVE how these books made me feel.  I'm one of those people who crave an unhappy ending sometimes, because I tend to appreciate the story more when that happens.  Kind of like 12 Monkeys, if you've ever seen that.  You wish Bruce Willis could conquer his future, but that just doesn't happen.  But he does fix the problem in that movie, much like the problem in this story (the Capitol) is eventually fixed.  But just because the problem gets fixed doesn't mean all the survivors are free to live their happy lives.  Katniss and the other fighters are trapped by their own pasts, even though they're technically free in the end.  Dang, this is a really good trilogy!!
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|Drake's sophomore effort [[ASIN:B005JLN9ZI Take Care [Deluxe Edition]]] is easily one of 2011's most anticipated albums.  A guaranteed commercial blockbuster, if there was any concern, the concern was how would Drake follow-up his excellent, Grammy-nominated debut effort [[ASIN:B003K1ZF2O Thank Me Later]]. The answer in my humble opinion is `very well.'  Take Care is not your average hip-hop album, but neither was Thank Me Later and Drake's core fan base don't expect a `traditional' rap album.  Drake is `outside of the box' and on Take Care, he goes beyond the moody scope of his debut, crafting a more stream-of-conscious, emotionally-driven effort.  It takes a few listens for the sometimes intellectual effort to unveil, well, itself, but after being implanted into Drake's mindset, Take Care, makes - or almost - makes perfect sense.<br /><br />\\"Over My Dead Body\\" starts the album as mysteriously as \\"Fireworks\\" featuring Alicia Keys did from Thank Me Later, if not more so.  This time, the muse is an even subtler Chantal Kreviazuk providing vocals and additional piano to Noah \\"40\\" Shebib's minimalist production.  Drake's rhymes are as `spacey' and `mind-boggling' as ever, but fans would expect nothing less, right? \\"Shot for Me\\" is a bit more accessible, sampling \\"Anything\\" as performed by R&B group SWV.  Shebib's production is as solid as ever and Drake's vocals, this time sung more or less, suit the restrained, moody vibe of this cut.  The end of \\"Shot for Me\\" features lead-in production for the album's best, most accessible track as of yet, \\"Headlines,\\" which is, coincidentally also a single.  \\"Headlines\\" is produced by Boi-1da, given the album a slightly different sound, though Drake's buddy Noah Shebib also co-produces.  The way that the synths represent the evening `headlines' is ingenious, not to mention Drake's quasi-rapped/quasi-sung lyrics are sharp.<br /><br />\\"Crew Love\\" featuring the Weeknd is interesting, proving to be perhaps the album's most conceptual cut.  The Weeknd `hold it down' for the most part, until Drake rolls in throwing lyrical punches and sounding top-rate.  \\"Take Care,\\" featuring Rihanna is good, though not the best of the effort.  Rihanna sounds solid and Drake's none too shabby himself, but promo-buzz single \\"Marvin's Room\\" outshines, still holding some superiority as one of the set's best cuts.  The production is lush yet muted, lazy yet haunting, showing how talented producer Noah Shebib really is.  Drake's `stream-of-consciousness,' minimalist rhymes/vocals are perfect and as chilling as the production work.  \\"Buried Alive Interlude\\" follows and while interludes are usually pointless, this one possesses and interesting palette of sounds, and sounds as if it would be perfectly at home on say KiD CuDi's [[ASIN:B003P2VGN0 Man On The Moon 2: The Legend of Mr. Rager]].<br /><br />\\"Under Ground Kings\\" is solid, while \\"We'll Be Fine\\" features some great, collaborative production by T-Minus & Noah Shebib.  Birdman's guest spot may be a bit questionable as he provides a spoken-word cameo as opposed to rapping, but Drake holds it down just fine with- or without his appearance. \\"Make Me Proud\\" featuring Nicki Minaj is another stand out, produced exclusively by T-Minus. Both Drake and Minaj rap and sing, providing for one the efforts most entertaining moments.  Would one expect less after the two yielded such great chemistry on \\"Up All Night\\" from Thank Me Later.  \\"Lord Knows,\\" featuring Rick Ross, is a show stealer with excellent production from standout producer Just Blaze.  Drake sounds among his most inspired of the effort and Rick Ross certainly provides a solid lift.  \\"Cameras/Good One Go Interlude\\" is another winner, despite its expansive 7:15 length.  The cut has a nice, easy-going feel and Drake does what he does best - Drake.  \\"Doing it Wrong\\" and \\"The Real Her,\\" featuring Lil Wayne & Andre 3000 are ok, but a bit less stellar than the rest of the material.  \\"The Real Her\\" is a bit sleepy, even withguest spots from two of today's premier MCs. Go figure.<br /><br />\\"Look What You've Done\\" atones, while \\"HYFR,\\" in all it's explicitness in title, finds T-Minus yielding more production magic.  Lil Wayne redeems himself here following the sleepiness of \\"The Real Her\\" and Drake is a potent as always.  \\"Practice\\" follows, featuring low-key production, but a searing, catchy hook.  \\"The Ride\\" closes the standard edition solidly, though overstays its moody welcome at 5:51.  Most will prefer the more laudatory \\"Thank Me Now\\" from Drake's debut to this cut.  Two bonus cuts grace the deluxe edition, the Lil Wayne featuring \\"The Motto\\" and the more satisfactory \\"Hate Sleeping Alone.\\"<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B005JLN9ZI Take Care [Deluxe Edition]]], is an anomaly and a hip-hop classic (by 2011 standards mind you).  Different from all the other rap efforts released this year, Drake combines many styles and delivers satisfactory results.  Sure, there are few cuts he may have edited a bit to make them shorter or cut a couple from this lengthy affair, but Take Care is more exceptional than not, making it one of the year's more intriguing efforts.oday's premier MCs.

0307593312|4.0|A steely-nerved assassin able to locate the precise point in the nape of a man's neck where inserting a needle-thin ice pick can kill him without bloodshed or apparent cause of death... A dwarfish man with a misshapen, overly large head and comical features who is a disbarred lawyer, top-notch gumshoe, and father of two... A mysterious town emptied of people-prowled at night by other beings-to which one may travel but once, never to return... Two moons in the sky: the familiar one, full and yellow, and next to it a smaller, lopsided moon, \\"greenish, as though thinly covered with moss\\"... A literary fraud scheme hatched to win a prestigious award... dark practices by a secretive cult... a malevolent (or possibly only amoral) race of \\"little people\\" with which mankind has coexisted for a very long time...  Who else but Haruki Murakami could pluck these threads from the ether and weave them together like an air chrysalis (another of his memorable images)? Trying to explain how he can do this and produce a coherent and entertaining book tempts a reviewer to quote a line by the author himself:  \\"If you can't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation.\\" But you don't need to understand it to enjoy this mammoth novel, which I suspect most readers will.  Now for the big but... BUT, though imaginative and engaging, the book isn't without its problems. Fundamentally a love story, its grip on your heartstrings can weaken at times as the lovers meditate yet again on their (thuTHUMP... thuTHUMP...) special bonding experience from a plethora of slightly different angles. Call me jaded, but I could have done without at least fifty pages of this rapture-text. The book is overly long, including gratuitous sex scenes which carry the plot forward not one whit and, as others have pointed out, are clearly written by a man when they allege to represent a woman's experience. There are also troubling innuendoes and undertones sexual and religious thatwill likely incense certain readers, not all of them overly sensitive. The final dénouement is less than engrossing... more like adequate. The novel concludes with enough intentional loose ends for the author to conveniently pen a sequel should the Muse stir in him or his bank account get depleted.  This may not be Murakami at his best, but it's still Murakami! If the sentiment at times borders on the maudlin, there are scenes of profound emotion, like Tengo's attempt to find the truth about his parents from his dying father-if he is his father-that few writers could carry off. The flaws are only so visible because the jewel is so bright.  Managing readers' expectations for each new work is probably more difficult than writing them for someone with this author's talent and record. To paraphrase a famous quip about concert pianists, better to read less-than-peak Murakami than the best works of almost any other living writer. Read the book and see if you agree.
030726999X|5.0|A great book! I am SO hooked on Steig Larsson, and I deeply regret his death (ie only one book left to read). The only downside is all the Swedish names and places, and there are a lot of characters and towns in this book with foreign names, but on the other hand it is educational as well.

0596806027|2.0|I bought this book because I needed an HTML5 introduction that doesn't try to teach me HTML basics all over again. I bought this book specifically because, let's face it, it was an O'Reilly with an animal on the cover and my desired subject in the title. That was good enough for me.   What I did miss is the \\"Up & Running\\" tag line. That meant you get a brief introduction to the new elements in HTML5, but do not expect a whole lot of details on any of these elements.   Much to my surprise, the tutorials in the book were cursory at best-- with sometimes unexplained components.   The icing on the cake is that the site referenced throughout the entire book as the download site for the sample code is DOA!!! Every reference to the site generates a 404 and a 410!!! Very VERY unlike an O'Reilly product.  I would not recommend or repurchase.
B005I0DUMC|5.0|It's about time this fantastic movie received a proper Blu-Ray treatment. It looks seamless and spotless, as close to viewing a fresh print of a 2011 film. It's quite an accomplishment since Cop Land is now nearly 17 years old. The audio is good, though not as impactful as the picture quality. BD purists would likely take issue with that, but for those of us who aren't as picky it's not a problem.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, what else can be said that hasn't already been said? It's one of Sly Stallone's best performances in his entire career, he's amazing as Sheriff Freddy Heflin. Gone is the wise cracking action star of the 80s, and in its place is a down on his luck, out of shape guy that few if anyone in the world of Cop Land takes seriously or respects. His lack of hearing in one ear has kept him from getting a spot on the NYPD, an injury from the rescue of a young woman who lives in the town and whom he still keeps in touch with. Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel), the man who took care of Freddy and got him his job as sheriff of Garrison, NJ, smiles and pats him on the back but underneath it all you can see full well his using and manipulation of this guy who likes to help people but is dismissed outright for his shyness and awkward manner. Once Freddy truly catches on and sees the results of his supposed friends' illegal activities and how the town of Garrison came to be, he decides he'd rather be right than have these leeches benefitting off of his blindness. He takes them all on. Freddy's left with almost no friends, including the woman whose life he saved. One of the most maddening scenes is when she outright accuses him of trying to replace her husband, when Freddy has done nothing but listen and comfort her amid her husband's severe short comings.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Cop Land, rectify that immediately!
0446585025|1.0|When people say about their favorite celebrities that they would listen to them reading the yellow pages, it is not usually meant to be taken literally. Apparently, Ellen's fans love her that much.  I thought the book was a waste of paper.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|The last time I read this book, I was in 7th grade and thought it was ridiculous. I totally got the whole unrequited \\"I'm not worthy of you\\" love thing, but, come on, what type of girl--even an ugly one--could fall for a man who was more than twice her age?  Now, a couple years later, I see the appeal of a mature and experienced man, and now I can not only commiserate with the unrequited love sentiment, but I am madly in love with this Mr. Rochester. Of course, he looks 28 instead of 40-something, but the movie completely captures the glory of the novel. It's gorgeous, the actors are all lovely (Judy Dench woot!), and you cannot help but love Mia's Jane. A win for 19th centure movie-lovers. Even my dad loved it, and he refuses to admit that he has a heart.  The movie does take a more Gothic tone ... which is to say that all of the outtakes on the DVD are really creepy and kinda disturbing because, in the end, love sells, so the things that were kept were those that would keep the teenage girls coming back rather than the twelve-year-old boys. Wise decision. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the facial hair. There was not a single commendable mustache, and I don't care when mutton chops were in fashion, there had to be a standard and these men could not have been anywhere near it.  Otherwise, flawless. I can't wait to see what else this director makes sublime.

1451627289|4.0|Many of you will cringe at the following sentence.  This is my first Stephen King book. Yes, I know. Stop looking at me like that and listen for a second. This book is amazing. The opening pages really did a lot to get me invested in the main character. When I say that, really I mean to point out that the writer did so much, with so little. It's a simple introduction to a complex character. Someone you will WANT to follow and see where the path leads. There is where many modern books fail, and fail hard in my opinion. Those first two pages are crucial in getting me hooked, and King managed to do that with just a few sentences.  JFK was, and still is an American hero to me. And while I do differ with Stephen's opinion on the lone shooter theory, that does not take away from what is done here. It is riveting work, and he obviously did a lot of research because some of the ways history ties into the main story is incredibly clever.  Mixing my favorite fringe science genre (time travel) and one of my favorite characters in history so well is an accomplishment. I have had many day dreams myself about the what if's. What if we could go back? Who would we save, and how would we do it?  It's all here, and what's here is fantastic.  Stop reading this, and START reading this book. You won't regret it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|When I read the initial reviews of this product, I was ready to refuse the shipment and get an immediate refund.  I'm so glad I didn't.  I have NO IDEA why it is described as \\"cheap\\" in addition to the other choice criticisms.  It is a perfectly lightweight cover that fits the Fire like a glove.  It doesn't look cheap, but rather sleek and high-fashion.  I buy similar covers for my cell phones, so this cover fits right in with my collection.    I agree that it is not as cheap as other covers, but those other ones look bulkier.  I would recommend this cover to others.

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|A lot of people have been complaining that this album is emo. But Drake has always been a little bit emo; he's always had tracks that were slower and actually showcased his singing skills. I don't particularly care for that side of him. But he slays on the rapping. I wish the whole YMCMB/OVO crew would tour together but I'm pretty sure that's illegal or something because that would be craaaaaaaaaaazy.  Top tracks:  Over My Dead Body  Headlines  Underground Kings  We'll Be Fine  HYFR  Practice  Hate Sleeping Alone
0545323126|5.0|These were purchased for my grandaughter's 7th birthday.  She is a voracious reader and loved them.  The only problem is she had them read in a little over a week. I'm not saying that they were too short or easy, they weren't.  It's just that she enjoyed them so much that all she did in her free time was read.  For some reason, after reading these books she decided that she wants to write books and has been writing little stories ever since and wants to be an author. I think that is a good thing.
B0024DQXW0|2.0|Honest to God being of the Woodstock generation I had Great expectations from this release, and was very disappointing with the resolution and the editing of this version. I was really looking for something that looked like at least somewhat close to the original theatrical release but this fell very short. The Audio is barely OK and sounds flat (dynamics are lacking in the music)and the added footage does not add much to the film.<br /><br />In addition I would be hard pressed to say it's a Hi Def film. The contrast in many parts is just poor, and no it's not my set. I have a newer set that was rated pretty high, and I have never had this issue in concert films. I guess I would say except on vintage poorly non Hi Def films that were poorly transferred. Over all I can not see anything about this making it look or sound like a newly Remastered Version Hi Def  release, Nothing!

0307891402|5.0|I'll be honest and admit that I did not expect this to come in a hardcover.  The book is about an inch and a half thick and probably the most substantial game guide I've ever laid eyes on.  It is about as comprehensive a game guide as I've ever seen as well - the best part of it is that it is not a complete step by step walkthrough.  In other words, it won't tell you to go straight, turn right, open the chest, etc... - those the regular player can figure out themselves.  Instead, it gives you enough hints and direction so that you can easily complete every mission but keep some of the mystery and surprise that Skyrim (and indeed Oblivion) is so good at.  If I were to offer one criticism, the maps are separate from the quests, which requires some flipping back and forth.  Now I know the game is open ended and the various dungeons and forts can be encountered at random, hence the need to keep them separate from the quests.  The book makes it a little easier though, by supplying two ribbon bookmarks.    Overall, what a deal for the price, and you can even leave this book on your living room table, it looks that good.
B005XOPEOU|2.0|Whoever produced Mylo Xyloto should stop producing and change jobs. All instruments are to the max, there is no harmony, no rhyme or reason. Couple of Coldplay's strengths lie in vocals and the piano, but they are almost nowhere to be heard in all the noise. This album sounds like an orchestra warming up for the concert.<br /><br />I thought I'm getting a deal at $5, but this has been a waste of money. This album is Coldplay's 'St Anger' ...
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle gets better every season! The writting, the plot, the actor's chemistry...  Stana Katic(Beckett, the detective turned moonlighting muse.) and Nathan Fillion(The titular Castle, our crime-fighting writer.) are better than ever, with the writers mixing comedy and seriousness along with a growing relationship to give us the best season to date. Although it's a fun show and can be appreciated by both the casual watcher and the avid Caskett fan, the writers skillfully craft inside jokes for those who have been with the series from the beginning(where Castle and Beckett are often stuck in similar situations and are forced try the shoe on the other foot.) or even followed the actors' careers for years(Castle dresses up as \\"a space cowboy\\" to which his daughter retorts \\"weren't you that like five years ago?\\" referencing his time as Captain Malcom Reynolds on \\"Firefly\\" and in \\"Serenity\\" the show and subsequent movie with a SciFi cult following.)  Whether you like crime dramas, shows fraught with sexual tension or a excellent drama capable of giving you a good laugh, Castle is sure to please.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Great calming yet challenging game.  The music is very soothing and goes a long way to keeping you centered while figuring out each puzzle.
1609611543|4.0|I give it 4 stars only because of frequent repetitions and simplifications, which I guess make sense when addressing the completely uninitiated but can get a bit grating if you have even average short-term memory and a basic understanding of human metabolism. I also think the focus is a bit off - in my view, weight loss is not an aim but a welcome side effect. The aim and result of following Dr. Davis' advice is a very tangible improvement in the overall well-being.   Still, I think this is an important book and I applaud the author for sticking his head out with an unpopular message. I have been experimenting with wheat and grain restriction and elimination way before finding \\"Wheat belly\\" and from my experience the advice is sound and beneficial. Possibly, it may not deliver spectacular and instantaneous results for everyone but what's the harm in giving it a shot? Had I not already started, I'd be definitely willing to try on the strength of this argument alone.

B001JIFYSA|1.0|Worst movie that I have ever seen.  I admit that I am not much of a chick flick viewer, but this was far worse than others that I've managed to sit through.  Chose this because of all of the great actors in it, but even the star power couldn't save this.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Thanks to a great cast of actors \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1\\" was quite spectacular !    The movie starred Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, who can be thanked for the bone chilling performance ( that made me regret not shutting my eyes at times ) and deserves credit for making the Deathly Hallows seem even more \\"deathly\\" !    The tension never really seems to go away in this movie with special effects that will leave you in awe, breathtaking excitment and action, along with purely deep \\"heart in their mouth\\" emotion that the characters were able to produce.  Another thing that surpised me about this movie is how they managed to actually put in a lot of amusing scenes !   It was also nice to see alot of familiar faces as  well !   Who they were you  will have to watch it to see !    Overall,  besides 1 or 2 corny parts in the movie, I think that you will regret it if you don't see this blockbusting film !

1451648537|4.0|A Story About A Complex And Amazing Man, November 16, 2011<br />By stingray (Covina, Ca. United States)<br /><br />This review is from: Steve Jobs (Hardcover)<br />In reading Steve Jobs biography , I take away how one person with the help of others change the world. And it appears that fate led him to be one of the greatest and influential person in our history up there with all the great geniuses that contributed to our world.<br /><br />I also take from the book- how he has a passion for design no doubt from his father who taught him from an early age to admire the design, everything has to be beautiful , even the back of a cabinet that no one sees. And how simplicity rules. Beauty and simplicity were his calling. He rarely compromise in either. Also, he was a perfectionist. He had to be right even if it cost more and took longer, the love of the product was most important, not the mighty dollar. I was most fascinated with his love for design and his love for German design- the passion for design -also began when he was a kid and the houses he lived known as Eichler houses which was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright- simple modern home for the American families. He admired them.<br />The author, Walter Issacson is an excellent writer, it took him two years and he interviewed and he talked to Jobs around 40 times and interviewed over 400 people that were close to Jobs and fought with him. He had no control over the project which was difficult( I would imagine because Jobs was a control freak)<br /><br />It was fascinating to me how the Mac, IPhone, iPad and iPod all got started. I have many of Apple products and its interesting to see how they were created.<br /><br />The one disappointing aspect of Jobs life is how he treated people. He excuse himself by saying that was the way he was but in the book, he had no regards for people feelings even his families sometimes and his closest friends. Maybe the gene that exit in people for empathy didn't reside in Jobs. He was for a lack of better term a real jerk. Again, he justified by saying that sometimes that is the only way to get people to push the envelope. I disagree, golden rule and all, I don't think he would have like people screaming and shouting at him and brow beating him in front of his peers.<br /><br />The book is fantastic and I highly recommend.for a lack of better term a real jerk.

B005HS00NW|3.0|I think there's a split in the camps of who likes which works of M83. Don't get me wrong, but I think everything changed after \\"Digital Shades.\\"    I love the old stuff. I think the first 3 albums are absolutely spectacular and completely timeless. I thought those albums couldn't be topped in their punch and impact, and I was right. \\"Saturdays=Youth\\" is overrated, and so is this new one. A lot of the tunes on here are way too forgettable, and can be easily thrown around and heard in the background at a coffee shop and not actually capture my ears. May be that's because they evoke too much of the 80's synth and gets lost for me. There's too much \\"crying\\" as I like to call it, those \\"pseudo-cries of pain\\" kind of sounds he overuses through the effects - but, may be that's what people like in the new sound now. I just like the slightly more grungier, metallic, grounded sounds of the earlier works. Am I out of touch? I don't think so. I know exactly what I liked in M83 when I first heard them back in 2001, and up to \\"Before the Dawn Heals Us\\" I didn't think M83 could ever be topped.   \\"Midnight City\\" is just not the sort of sound that I like from M83. It's too repetitive and derivative, and the singing adds nothing to it - except I wished that Iva Davies of Icehouse would sing on this album in place of Anthony, because he would've fit right in. And I loved Icehouse. Same problem with \\"Reunion.\\" Same with \\"Claudia Lewis.\\" Same with \\"My Tears are becoming a Sea.\\" Same with \\"New Map.\\" Same with \\"OK Pal.\\" Same with \\"Steve McQueen.\\" I mean he should've just hired Iva Davies and got some help. I could seriously put these songs somewhere in the middle of Icehouse's works and they would've fit in perfectly.    If this is what's representative of M83 now, I'm truly disappointed. May be it's also because he got more and more interested in the live-performance aspect of himself and that is why it went this way. But it didn't need to be - he told much better stories with the soundsand effects when he just focused on telling the stories in the sounds as if he was just instrumenting to be heard through the stereo through the internet radio (which is how I found M83 in the first place). May be he does need somebody like Nicolas, his old partner to help him with better sound-scape writing. Some of the other, more simple electronic tracks without the singing and wailing are a little better, the best being \\"Where the boats go\\" which is reminiscent of his older works. The older stuff is so much better.   I almost can't really listen to this new stuff since \\"Saturdays=Youth.\\" I wish he would get past the old church-synth he loves so much though. I never needed M83 to be a live-performance band. I think he hopes that he can catch us dreaming and not really paying attention. He knows it's sub-par. Or may be doesn't care - because he thinks he's so cool now standing up there on the stage pretending to look cool.   To add to the bit about how he wants to hear himself sing more, play more gigs on stage - Simon Cowell might say that it's a bit self-indulgent. It's one thing to want to make something to be enjoyed by an audience, but in this case, I think he just wants to be flashy on stage when he performs. That's why the songs are \\"songs\\" now rather than well-constructed theme tunes.
B005D0RDKW|4.0|To start with: the sound and video quality is fine. But the booklet and bonus section is for he birds compared with the bonus material of RIR or R30 (DVD). What bugs me is nearly the same revolving set-list over the last 10 years of live performing. Joining Rush since Exit stage left, I never missed a show in my local hometown arena Frankfurt Festhalle in Germany. But I am afraid that Rush has lost a little bit of their creative musical spirit ending up after T4E era. Thereof excluded are the composition of >R30 Overture< which is state of the art and the highly energetic instrumental >Malignant Narcissim<.  In the last decade of playing live, Rush was always focused on nearly the same stuff combining it with 2-4 songs of \\"new\\" material (here BU2B and Caravan). The latest shots of Red Barchetta, Camera Eye and Vital Signs are excellent, but Far Cry and Workin` them Angels among others were just filmed on Snakes and Arrows before. And from my point of view >Stick it out< and >Faithless< are nothing to write mother home about if you think about the excellent and diversified track record 40years down the road (e.g. Manhattan Project, Territories, The Weapon, Analog Kid, Prime Mover, Test for Echo, Cut to the Chase etc.). Also a live performance of <Where is my Thing?> would have be a great replacement for >Leave that thing alone< which was already released on Different Stages and RIR.   I know - all in all - it`s always an individual issue. But one is for sure: I don`t need CD and/or DVD compilations with nearly the same stuff again and again (see also release of >Working Man best of Rush Live<) when there is such a huge and fantastic material existing. Songs which never had been played and/or released as live versions.  It is hard to criticise an Icon, but I hope that there will be a real (!) change of the set-list some sunny day. Nevertheless, Rush still rocks ...!
B00003CX5P|4.0|I have nothing to say on the film, how good or bad this film is depends on the viewer.IMO both the Prequel and Original Trilogy are great, i'm going to be buying this because it's neccessary for my SW film collection, and i'm getting sick of watching it in alternative places with crappy quality.

0385738773|4.0|I just finished [[ASIN:0385738773 The Death Cure (Maze Runner Trilogy)]]a few minute ago, so it's still fresh in my mind. The first two books ( [[ASIN:0385737955 The Maze Runner (Maze Runner Trilogy, Book 1)]] and [[ASIN:0385738765 The Scorch Trials (Maze Runner Trilogy)]] ) were intriguing, and I thought the third book would be even better. Unfortunately, this book fell a little flat for me. It was NOT a bad book, it was actually really great, just not my cup of tea. A lot of the book felt stilted to me; the character reactions were a little predictable, but the characters themselves were well drawn and interesting. The concept for this story is amazing; well contrived, excellently mapped out, very unique. I haven't read anything like it before. Some of the emotions and emotional scenes felt forced, though, especially toward the end, and some of the emotions didn't seem realistic. The fight scenes were fantastic, but I could tell that the author, James Dashner, felt more comfortable writing about a good brawl than a good cry. I enjoyed the ending, and the suspense leading up to it was amazing; I really had no idea how it would all end. The plot itself was also great; James weaves in intrigue and suspicion and tension expertly. I could see the potential for this book, and I know it will have a lot of fans. I am a big fan, if only because I respect the author so much for bringing a great series to a close with a satisfying ending.

B005E7AOHI|1.0|Everyone knows Les is a bass god and Ler is one of the most under appreciated and under-rated guitarist in Rock, period. But this album quite frankly is embarrassing. I haven't felt this ripped off since seeing<br />\\"Stuart Smalley\\". Normally Les's sense of humor lyrically is smart and funny whether it is from his solo stuff (holy mackerel), Sausage, or Primus, but this one overall just isn't witty or funny. Just kinda stupid.<br />If you like disjointed noise that sounds like a pre-teen goof off band making music for a cartoon you'll be pleased. Now after 20 years of being a fan you'd expect a little more composure and actual songs with<br />some melody, context, SOMETHING! Instead of growing up musically Les is stuck in 7th grade, compared to Frizzle Fry this release is pathetic, and that just shouldn't be. There are three songs on this record that are tolerable and show the talents of the group.  (with Jay Lane on drums not Tim) But I don't care enough to remember which ones. Jay does a great job but unfortunately there is little to appreciate on this record overall. Save your money and time and put in any other release from Primus and hope Les can get a little serious musically and have a some pride before he actually releases another record. Put down the pipe buddy.

B006023AMM|5.0|After being dispointed with the new Coldplay album, this was the light in darkness.  I love all the tracks, I can say only thing is missing is more guitar solo.  There is a good solo at thed end of stop the clocks that trys to hard to sound liked like champagne supernova and from what I heard its not Noel playing.  Now, for the postives.  There is good solid song writing.  Noels voice is awesome and he can sign with the best of them.  This album is better than his brothers band, Beady Eye.  Liam maybe the voice, but it has always been Noel whos the voice, the vision, and the emotion.  Alot of these song could have been writen and played by Oasis.  This would have been a far better realse of songs if it came out after standing of the shoulder of giants album.  Highlights, On the run,What a life, If I had a gun.  Anyways, go get this album.

B002N3GD8K|5.0|Just a quick note to say the vinyl on this set sounds EXQUISITE. The mixes all sound original but with incredible clarity and definition. This 4x180g set is superbly mastered and pressed; silent, click-free vinyl. It sounds so good you just want to turn it up, up, up...  I'm really pleased with such a superb, definitive retrospective of the artist (though I do miss \\"True Blue\\"!). The sequence is happily not chronological but follows its own internal logic, at times clustering her 80's pop hits and elsewhere delving into her later works (eg the last 20 years!), which are also excellent and sound great in this context.   As noted elsewhere, the jacket cardboard is a bit thin--my copy had a folded-back crease on one corner---but it does an adequate job of housing the four superb vinyl slabs in its dual-capacity gatefold sleeves. But really, this is all about the music, and at less than a dollar per song, this comp is really kind of a steal, vinyl-wise.

0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's three-part epic detailing Pi Patel's life has been touted as many things: life-changing, God-realizing, a testament to the power of storytelling (this by President Obama). I found it to be an interesting, well-told story, with a conclusion that didn't quite feel fully realized, or even able to describe what I *think* Martel wanted to describe.  We see Pi's love for three major religions. We see his unyielding love for God, able to be represented in multiple different ways, all of them equal and understandable and respectable. Pi does not question God's existence. However, in the end, when we as readers are forced to choose and determine \\"the\\" story--we are asked (via Martel's authorial insertions in the book) to pick \\"the better story.\\" This phrase, \\"the better story,\\" is where Martel loses me. If we pick the better story (basically, that God exists), is that because the other, more plain story (randomness, evolution) is real, but the God story is simply \\"better?\\" What is Martel trying to have the reader determine? It seems obvious that Martel himself is religious, God-fearing, a believer, but this idea seems to contradict that. It's like he's saying, hey, I know evolution and chance is *the* reality, but I like the God story better, so I'm going to go with that.  So I get confused. Rather than this book being \\"an elegant proof of the existence of God\\" (President Obama's words), it seems to be \\"an exercise that demonstrates that believing in God is more fun than believing in science.\\"  Now--that philosophical and spiritual rant aside, Life of Pi is a good, well-researched story that is touching and teaching. Martel inspires in showing how well he knows those three major religions, Indian culture, Franco-Indian relations, oceanic survival, zoology, marine life, etc. He has done a good job inserting different pieces into this story. Although sometimes I was left feeling that he had multiple ideas for stories (zookeeping in India, a ship that sinks and lifeboat survival, a man-eating island) and just tried to weave them all together--it can feel disjointed (especially the man-eating island bit). But all in all it does work, amazingly, convincingly even, and with a good pacing.  I enjoyed the book while reading it, hence my four star review. But that doesn't clear up the confusion it left me with -- and then I realized that maybe that was Martel's intent all along, to at least hope the reader would seriously consider these questions and their implications. If so, he succeeded.  --- ---  \\"everything has a trace of the divine in it\\" (48)  \\"The individual soul touches upon the world soul like a well reaches for the water table. That which sustains the universe beyond thought and language, and that which is at the core of us and struggles for expression, is the same thing. The finite within the infinite, the infinite within the finite.\\" (49)  \\"Faith in God is an opening up, a letting go, a deep trust, a free act of love\\" (208)  \\"Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer.\\" (297)
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I purchased this case in all black which has a matte, industrial look to it. Its not gorgeous, but it gets the job done. It protects the Fire and it serves as an easel allowing the device to stand vertically or horizontally. Also, it doesn't add a lot of weight to the already hefty Fire. My only complaint is that the back of the case attracts lots of finger prints.
0393064476|1.0|There is nothing interesting about Lucretius or any of the Epicureans, really. They were the crass materialists of their day, which is why Lucretius ends up covered with dust in a monastic library in the first place. (A world view having no place for the human soul tends to be uninteresting to readers who have one.) The whole Lucretius aspect of this book is exaggerated and very poorly researched as evidenced by the false thesis. The kind of \\"modernity\\" that the author is trying to push on the reader is the kind that no self-respecting philosopher would ever be proud of. Imagine Auguste Comte writing a book about Italian humanism, and the result would be this book. The Swerve is an aberration, probably best for high school seniors desperate to sophisticate themselves at the college coffee shop. The fact that it won a National Book Award pretty much sums up the problem.<br /><br />If I wanted to make Poggio and the Italian humanists as boring and uninteresting as possible, this is the book I would write.

I'm glad I waited, and slowly but surely, some positive reviews started trickling in.  So I took a chance and decided to try it.  I can honestly say it isn't that bad.  The priced dropped $10 from the day I pre-ordered it.  Would I have kept it for $39.99?  Doubtful.  However, for $29.99 it is a pretty good case.  Luckily, Amazon being the outstanding company that they are quickly refunded back the difference in price.  I'm glad they did because this is a pretty good case.

B004ZN9NCY|5.0|At first after purchase I was a little miffed on why I chose this over some of the more-played albums I wanted to buy having the 11' remastering (Wall, Div Bell, Momentary, etc.) After listening, now I remember why (without being under any 'influence').   1st disc - live album:  What more can you say except you feel the strong Pompeii'an experience. Awesome swaying tempos, loads of talent from all musicians throughout. I'm esp. a huge fan of Astronomy Domine due to Sid's (more talented) influence and seeing it live here in WDC at RFK front-row (still deaf to this day from it).  The rest of the songs get a nice boost of volume and dynamic range improvement as well over the low quality cds I orig. bought back in the mid-80s as soon as they hit the shelf.   2nd disc - studio instrumentals:  All musicians shine with creativity here. What stood out hearing it this time around was a reminder of what makes this music so unique to anything else. Beginning with Roger Waters' Manchester Meadows acoustical & Several Species... tracks. They are soothing to the ear providing a sense of tranquility while combining psychedelia.  This then leads into my favorite, Gilmour's Narrow Way and what an intro it is - from the winding volume, swirling sound into a beautiful acoustical number as well. You appreciate his use (as well as all the members) of effects. This is worth the price of the album alone in my view but I'm jaded - I love David in all aspects. Rick and Nick also provide very cool pieces as well at the start and finish of the disc respectively. It's easier to just hear it for yourself rather than have someone explain their interpretation.  If you want more popular \\"hits\\" then stick to the run-of-the-mill Wall, Dark Side, and other more mainstream group releases - you can't go wrong. If you want something different/unique providing a sense of how the band was in their earlier yrs. showing the group's raw power plus their trademark psychedelic-side, then grab this remastered version. Methods of 'influence' optional.

B000FC1AGG|5.0|The book was very slow to start, I almost put it down a few times for lack of interest. However, once things get moving along, it really goes well! Very good read, well written. It was a little predictable, but still very enjoyable. I would have liked to see more effort put into the romance scenes.

The end was amazing, I was kinda hoping Gus would still be alive for the next season.What an insanely interesting psychopathic character. In any case, loved this season and can't wait to see season 5 ! Hoooray, one more to look forward to. The creators and actors all deserve Hollywood recognition for this series.

B004YXE438|5.0|To the developer:  I got my Fire the other day, and was browsing for a good jigsaw puzzle game to put on it.  I stumbled across this one, and noticed that it IS compatible with my smartphone, but NOT with my Kindle Fire!  Please tell me that this will change soon.  I know I'm not going to be the only one that will want to play it on the Fire, given the great reviews from others.  Thanks.  Addendum:  I purchased the $.99 expansion pack before I realized all of this.  It downloaded to my Fire, then when I tried to install it, it said it was incompatible with my device.  11/26/11:  Steve the Developer kept after Amazon until they finally tested this Pack and pushed it through so it's compatible with the Fire.  Many thanks for that.  The pictures are beautiful, and the app is really easy to use.  I will get many hours of fun out of this!  If you're on the fence at all, give it a try.  I don't think you'll be sorry.
1423101502|5.0|The end of my world started when a pegusas landed on the hood of my car. Has that ever happened to you? Well maybe that's just Percy and his own little half-blood world.     The main characters are Percy, Sally, Paul, Annabeth, Raquel, Grover, Black jack Cronos and Poseidon. They all help out with the exciting adventure of Percy.  Percy is a young 15 year old boy that is a half-blood. He never knew because his mom is just a normal mom Sally that works at a candy store and for extra money she works for cleaning other houses. Sally is married to Percy's step- dad Paul who is a major drinker. But he is trying to be nice to Percy. He is sure doing a great job letting Percy borrow his valuable and only car.     The places of the last Olympian are New York and count half-blood. New York is where Kronos is trying to take over the world by starting by killing the gods and the Demi gods. Count half-blood is a camp where all the half blood kids practice their powers and get ready for when the time is right to fight.  The animal of the gods was Black Jack an old friend of Percy. He is a horse with wings that is very loyal. He cannot speak but Every Half-blood can.  The problems in the book is that Kronos is trying to take over the world and he is starting a war to try to kill all of the Demi gods if all of the others are in war he can easily kill with no trying. Everyone needs help to defeat Kronos that took over Luke's body. One problem is that Clarissa the daughter of Aries is trying to tell them that if they do not meet her and her mom and Athena's needs that they will not help in the war. But no one knows that they are some of the most powerful people to help in the war.  Let me tell you the basics of this book: Percy Jackson is the son of Poseidon god of the sea. The war was about Koronos the bad guy trying to defeat and kill the Gods so he can take over the world and control all of the people as his slaves. Percy's father said he is too young to fight in the war so Percydisobeys his father. He got stabbed but went into the water to heal him. When he almost got stabbed in the same spot annabeth saved his life. The next day Koronos got out of the boy Lukes body and Luke killed Koronos. After all the war was over many were killed and sad.  The gods ended asking him if he was in the war and Percy didn't know what to say so he turns down to being immortal so the Gods granted him one wish and the wish was.........( I can't tell!!!!! :) )    The end!!!!!!!!! (Wasn't that such a great book?????)

0439023521|5.0|WARNING: This book may not be right for the light of stomach.       Read this book. For me that is enough said but you may be one of those people who requires more persuasion, so how about this. The Hunger Games has a great story and an even better plot, if you like action, suspense, some drama, and gore, then this is definitely the book for you.        The Hunger Games book takes place sometime in the future, in the nation of Panem which is located on the continent that was once known as North America.  There is a capital and twelve districts in the nation of Panem.  The capital has ruled the districts for over 50 years, since the revolution against the capital.....also known as \\"The Dark Days\\".  To remind the districts of the Dark Days and to show the districts that they can't do anything to stop the capital, the Capital holds the annual \\"Hunger Games\\".  For the Hunger Games, each district sends one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18, into an arena that is different every year (could be woods, dessert, etc.)  Each of the contestants is dropped into the arena, which stretches for miles. Here they must fight to the death, which can possibly take up to several weeks.      During the annual event where they draw the names for the participants  of the Hunger Games,  Prim, who is the little sister of the main character Katniss, is chosen! Katniss volunteers and is allowed to take her sister's place in The Hunger Games, and the story begins.  To survive in the Hunger Games, Katniss must go through betrayal, agony, and torment.  Katniss does not expect to live.      Now that you know about the book, give me one reason why you should not read it.  If you can give me a reason, then good for you,  but, overlook it and take my word that this is a good book. If you are one of those people that can never find an interesting book to read, then fear not, for this New York Times bestseller book is the first in a trilogy.  Now go and ask you parents to buy this book foryou...use whatever tactics necessary to overcome parenthood authority and if all else fails, then resort to the....\\"Are we there yet?\\" strategy.
076790382X|2.0|I read this book hoping for some interesting insights on what it must be like to live in England for 20 years and then return to the US. I was looking for indications on the subtle and not-so-subtle differences between these two countries (\\"Separated by a common language,\\" as Winston Churchill used to say).  Instead, for the majority of the book, I got a mixed bag of musings on inconsequential topics in the style of Andy Rooney, along the lines of \\"Have you ever noticed how the cutting thing on the floss container always seems to. ...\\"  This book has pot-boiler written all over it; and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
0545265355|5.0|Would you risk your life to save your sibling..? In this series the main characters all have their own personality. There is the main character, Katniss Everdeen. Most of the story is in her point of view. There is her best friend, Gale, Her sister Primrose, Her mother, All the towns people, Peeta, his mom and dad, and Gale's family. Katniss and Gale like to hunt, they are adventures and talented. Her mother is a nurse and a doctor known as the healer of the village, people bring the injured, sick,  and the dying to Katniss's mother. Prim is her mother's helper, she helps bring the medicine or towels to the patients. Peeta is kind of quiet and he loves to draw and to bake treats. Peeta's mom and dad are the bakers of the town, baking bread, cookies, cakes, and other food. Gale doesn't have a father neither does  Katniss.     Katniss has medium length brown hair past her shoulders and usually wears it in a braid down her back, and fare, pale skin. Gale has dark brownish black hair and a well built body and fare skin. Peeta had short blond hair kind of small body, not very muscular. Prim had long curly blond hair and a small body. She lives in district 12 out of 13     Most of the settings in this series is mainly inside town and outside the fences in the forest where they hunt. The usually hunt in the day time. They hunt in all kinds of weather, snow, sun, rain, dark, cold, hot. Every year they chose 2 kids from each district to participate in the Hunger Games. They chose one boy and one girl. If they call someone's name any of their friends or family can take their place in the Hunger games. Once you turn 12 your name gets put in the drawing. You can have your name put more than once and in return they give you food. Her district is really poor and most people put their names in several times so their family can eat that night.     The reaping day is the day they draw the names. That night every family cooks a big dinner and then go to the town center and wait for the names to get called, if your name gets called you go on stage and stand up there. The families whose children get called usually hide in their houses crying at night. Katniss Everdeen must come to a hard decision... She must choose between saving herself, or her sister. This may be the hardest choice in her life and may affect her and her life a lot.  I would recommend this series to people who enjoy a mix of action, adventure, a little bit of romance, and if you enjoy reading books that will leave you hanging making you want more. I enjoyed this book because I think it was very well written and it left me hanging making me want more and more. I was a bit upset when I finished the last book. I want the series to continue and I can't wait for the movie to come out.

1400049628|5.0|Do you like to live? Well, if so, you should read this book -unless you want to be devoured by a bunch of undead flesh addict. If you do read it you will be prepared for the zombie apocalypse.     The point of this book is to protect you from zombies. Not a common everyday threat so someone has to teach you about how to kill them and not get killed. It is interesting to me because not many authors write only about this kind of topic.  Some cool points in are the weapons that the author (Max Brooks) writes about that he says are choice zombie fighting weapons. He gives sections on firearms, bludgeoning tools, and traps. He also gives tips on where to hideout to wait out the apocalypse. He also talks about fighting the zombies if it ever comes to that.  Max also explains a zombie's weakness and strengths. He says zombies can see very far away and they don't breathe so ever if you are anchored in the middle of a lake a zombie could climb up the chain and get you! A zombies weakness is ... bullets, But only if they are shot in the head to turn the brain to mush.  This book is an all around good read I enjoyed it and I recommend it to anyone how likes zombies and horror. I read it in on whole day because it is a real page turner. I guess it would be pretty helpful IF zombies actually existed. So if you like how it sounds check it out its really good.

B005TQAI6G|1.0|I really believe in some ways Spears had a genius never before seen. I think her \\"Live From Las Vegas\\" DVD, which I reviewed here at Amazon, was simply the best show ever put on by a single female performer, and I've been going to the theater for over 50 years. Britney had a breakdown. She has not been able to get in touch with her creativity since. These meds thicken and slow you down, and confuse you into thinking all is OK, when it isn't. I saw her on stage in \\"Circus.\\" I was afraid she was going to stop on stage and start to cry. The show was smoke and mirrors with no real dancing from Britney. This is the same thing: a sense that everything is moving s-o-o  s-l-o-w-l-y and without any enjoyment on her part.  I feel for the girl. I do. It takes tremendous guts to do what she's doing, but she's running out of time, and you can only play the \\"Emporer's New Clothes\\" routine for so long (as Empress).

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I'm not sure why people are leaving this movie negative reviews because of something that is coming free with it???? Not sure that is a fair thing to do.  Good movie but as for the \\"digital copy\\" I'm not sure what peoples problem with it is. you log in use the app and you can download it to your phone and to your computer.  I downloaded it last night then watched while my phone was in airplane mode so I'm not seeing the issue other than it is different.  People don't like different and more importantly people don't understand different.  Plus I see better advantages with this kind of copy since you can sign into your account wherever you are and stream it.  Before it was just on your computer on your device.
B00000J7JO|4.0|According to my opinion this is their best album. Thats what i and some friends think about this album. Of course it is their most commercial album but its so damn good. Most of the tracks and especially the first 7 tracks are masterpieces, the rest are just good - and there is not a bad song. This album is in my top list cool albums with Fraky Stelay (I believe is very underrated album). A must for all people since you will like it.
B005HNG1S0|5.0|It is a pleasure and a privilege to join the other positive reviewers in appreciating this new disc from Helene Grimaud.  She serves up concertos 19, plus 23.  And to cherry-top the utterly delightful festivities, we get a concert aria, Mojica Erdmann soprano, and Grimaud assaying the solo piano part.  The main staying power of these readings boils down to the tangible impression that everybody involved gives off in abundance: We just love playing Mozart.  In his letters, the composer liked to call attention to the fact that he could write for everyone, the average lay audience person as well as the learned nobles or cognoscenti.  The music making we get on this disc is that sort of enterprise.  I happened to be driving a loaner Mercedes last week with the very nice sound system playing Grimaud, this disc, and when I stopped in the drive through for coffee on the move, the farm country young lady who was my teller could not resist saying what nice music  was playing in the car.  I replied, \\"It is hard to do better than Mozart.\\"  I immediately wanted to give her the disc on the spot, since per Mozart's wide, deep audience appeal, it seems fitting that anybody who likes these concertos already has some basis for laying claim.  Like the car, however, my Grimaud disc was also on loan, so I moved back onto the local highway, feeling quite bonded in passing by a shared love of these tremendously rewarding piano concertos.  Concerto 23 plumbs such depths with lights and shadows that it usually comes off better than many readings of Concerto 19.  Grimaud and her chamber orchestra (drawn from the nearly constantly stellar BRSO) do not slight number 19, any more than 23 is under-served.  Both works simply come off joyously, with some muscularity and drive that many players on disc fail to perceive or communicate in Mozart.  Both concertos and the concert aria interpolated in the middle of the disc are anything but salon-style background music for palace soirees, garden parties, and showing off your social or economic status in the composer's own time in Vienna.  My first spins of this disc along farm country highways quickly committed me to hearing the incisive, involved music-making of the BRSO chamber orchestra.  Their Mozart playing is so fine that I would enjoy hearing them do the Mozart symphonies, I conjur.  It took me longer to warm up and get drawn into Grimaud's piano work, not because she plays wrong notes or short-sheets the music assigned to her instrument, but because she strikes out so willfully on her own Mozartian paths.  Grimaud is not playing against the band's Mozart, but she is not subsumed or subsidiary, either; whether we look back to period instrument bands and fortepiano stylings (Gardiner-Bilson-Levin, Viviana Sofronitzky), whether we recall warmer or more round-phrasing performers of the not too distant past [Rubinstein, Moravec, Curzon (by all means w Britten as well as w Kertesz), or whether we recall more freewheeling, even frankly Romantic readings served up in live concerts.  It was quick and easy to wish that this band had been partners on record way back when, with the great Lili Kraus, for example.  It took longer to stop wishing for Alicia de Larrocha or Lili Kraus, and tune into Grimaud at the keyboard.  Once my ears opened up and dialed on her wavelength, I found myself thankful for the shift in hearing.  Grimaud now seems sure to belong among the newer generation who is now giving us some very good, yet often not entirely traditional or business as usual, Mozart.  Think, David Fray, Angela Hewitt, Christian Zacharias, Mathias Kirschnereit, and ... Helene Grimaud.  Yet, Grimaud also links us to past great Mozart interpreters, as she reminds us that the composer has strength, not just quaint manners; her Mozartian clarity recalls the best of, say, Maria Joao Pires or Robert Casadesus.  Her inner depth and directness recall Leon Fleisher's most welcome return to Mozart.  Okay.  Get this disc or at least - consider getting this disc.  Five, five, five stars.

The depth she brings to this character is beyond perfection.   Oliver Platt is one of my favorites of all time and does not disappoint.  I saw this movie by myself and after words searched for someone to discuss it with so buy this now and do the same!  This movie creates a real sense of love, pain, fear, sadness, and laughter.  GO HOLLYWOOD FOR HAVING COURAGE TO MAKE A GREAT MOVIE!  ***Spoiler alert*****  as far as the SEX goes that is the point of the movie. Showing the transition from physical attraction to unconditional true love.  I am just lucky they are both hot as hell!
B005L38QHA|4.0|Despite it's over the top looks, this is actually a nice, solid quality mouse.  The plastic casing material is glossy, smooth and firm.  In other words, you can't squeeze and bend the plastic while grasping it with your hand. (I hate when mice are made with cheap plastic that bends.)  There are a variety of extra buttons--all fully customizable--located around the mouse.  The four thumb buttons in particular are easy to press and are individually beveled for easy \\"touch recognition\\".  I'm less partial to the two buttons residing on either side of the scroll wheel, as they are not particularly easy for my index finger to reach and accurately press.  However, as a whole I am quite presently pleased and satisfied with both the feel and performance of the mouse.  For World of Warcraft users, there is a \\"way-cool\\" light up WoW logo in the bottom center of the mouse.  You can use the supplied macro management software to change the illumination color, frequency and intensity.  The top portion of the mouse is covered in a red/orange lightning skin which cannot peel off.  The supplied software directly mirrors in-game hotkey settings which is fantastic for quick and easy hotkey assignment.  WoW users will really love this mouse for the software alone.<br /><br />Overall Rating: a solid \\"A\\" - not the absolute best mouse in the world, but certainly a great choice for gamers.<br /><br />Also: I am a Mac OS X (Lion) user, the mouse and software are fully compatible with OS X and extremely easy to set up.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'll start of by honestly saying that the only reasons that I even decided to read this book were because 1. I could \\"borrow\\" it for free from the kindle library 2. I wanted see all the hype about it, especially with its movie opening in a few months. I could never get into other teen and sci-fi fantasy book/movies such as Twilight and Harry Potter. They were also the reasons I hadn't read this book sooner!  Well I downloaded it on my Kindle and I expected to only read a few pages, maybe a couple chapters. Let's just say, I could NOT put it down. Almost every chapter is filled with suspense and twists, I couldn't stop reading. I finished the whole book in a day. The ending really left me wanting more, and so I instantly bought the next book \\"Catching Fire\\". I'm most halfway through with it and it has not let me down (well that's for another review).
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I love how so many folks are complaining about the case's price -- for a custom case available on day one, you ought to expect to pay a premium.  If you want your knock-off case that sort-of fits (until it doesn't and your Kindle drops) for $5, give it a few months for the generic vendors to catch up.  For my $200 investment, I'll happily pay $39 for a perfectly usable, and exact-fit case available on day one.  To keep things in perspective, the Apple iPad (Gen 1) case was nothing more than a formed felt sheet, and it cost $39.  To Amazon's credit, they lowered the price to $29, which makes it even more reasonable.  As others have commented, the rubberized case fits like a glove, to the point where it's actually pretty difficult to remove once it's on.  Don't worry, you can remove it, but let's just say that your Kindle will *not* fall out.  I chose this case over the leather case, because this case offers full side/edge protection, whereas the leather case holds the Fire on 4 corners, leaving the sides exposed.  I'm not too confident that the elastic will last, given the fact that it feels like a strip of normal elastic -- with no special engineering invested towards making it extra durable to match the durable case.  We'll see -- only time will tell.  As a landscape video playback case, it isn't the greatest, in that it takes some fiddling to get things locked in.  I suspect this is due to the fact that the edge of the front flap tapers to a tip, instead of a flat edge.  Not a huge deal.  All in all, a solid case available on day one.

1451627289|5.0|I will preface by saying that I have been an unabashed King fan for several years now.  This review may reflect a slight bias in his favor.  Also, the briefest of synapses - Jake Epping is shown a way to time travel back to 1958, where, aside from other pursuits and complications, he plans to live for 5 years and to change history by stopping the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  For a couple of decades I have noticed a trend in Mr. King's writing.  He has evolved from being \\"America's horror master\\" to being an amazingly skilled storyteller, whom I would want at my campfire during Story Hour.  It isn't just that his plots are powerful and unexpected, though they often are.  It's not that his characters are relatable, though they usually are.  The best thing (for me) about King's stories are their texture.  In so many of his tales he weaves a world that we can see, taste and smell.  Tina Fey might say \\"I want to go to there.\\"  This 800+ page brick of a book is no exception.  Interestingly, I felt like it was more a play in three acts: Jake Gets Used To Living In the Past, The Dunning Problem, and Texas.  Fortunately, all three acts were fascinating and had me hooked from early on.  I won't spoil anyone's read with too many details, but I will say that this book's joy, as is usually the case, is more in the journey than the destination.  Stephen King conveys the simplicity of far-off 1958, the charm of a small town at its best, the diseased heart of a small town at its worst and the sweetness of random moments (a dance, holding hands, etc) with a flair and mastery that nearly always causes me to sit back and contemplate them long after the final page is turned.  Once I have digested this initial foray, I will need to read it again to savor everything I missed or didn't appreciate the first time.  As for King's portrayal of the JFK assassination and the consequences of preventing it?  I say those are incidental (really!); mere vehicles to allow the true story to be told.  The true story, of course, is a slightly more complicated version of the truism \\"the more people change, the more they stay the same.\\"  With a healthy dose of \\"love makes the world go 'round\\" sprinkled in there.  A small quibble: dust jackets and critics need to quit trying to portray King's novels as \\"scary\\" or \\"terrifying.\\"  He has frightening elements in his stories now, but he cannot be categorized as such like when he was starting out.  He has surpassed labels and will, in my opinion, eventually be taught in college classes as one of the great writers of post-1950 America.  Thank you, Stephen, for another marvelous ride.  This one made my heart pound and my face flush, as your best rides always do.  Well worth the price of admission.

B001VZY4MS|3.0|Actually, my title is sarcastic: This IS Neil Young's first solo album, from 1968. And it's not bad at all; it's just that this album sounds very restrained compared with the music Young would go on to make soon after it.<br /><br />There are some real gems here, including \\"Here We Are in the Years\\" and the striking but oddball \\"The Old Laughing Lady.\\" Other songs, though, including the instrumental \\"String Quartet From Whiskey Boot Hill\\" are simply forgettable. To his immense credit, Young closes out the album with \\"The Last Trip to Tulsa,\\" a nine-minute-plus guitar-and-voice exploration that's as head-scratchingly good as some of Dylan's mid- to late-Sixties work, to which it seems to pay at least a bit of homage.<br /><br />It took only one more album for Young to start making legendary music: \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\\" the first album which benefited from the presence of backing band Crazy Horse, is just phenomenal. It's not that the songwriting is better; Young has been a great tunesmith since his days with Buffalo Springfield. But the delivery of these pieces, from the concise \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" to stretched workouts such as \\"Down by the River\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand,\\" is nothing less than awe-inspiring.<br /><br />From there, Young moved on to \\"After the Gold Rush\\" on his own and the period where he first became the Y in CSNY. His contributions to the group's 1970 album, \\"Deja Vu,\\" are among the best on that album, and indeed \\"Helpless\\" is one of the great songs of Young's entire career.<br /><br />So yes, go ahead and buy this first album. Just be aware that \\"Neil Young\\" is not the best record he's ever made. All that said, it's well worth hearing.

B0000C172X|5.0|It's hard to believe some of the releases from this part of Neil Young's career got such mixed reviews. Alas, there's been lots of critical reappraisal (read: 20/20 hindsight) since those days, and \\"On the Beach\\" now is accepted as being right up there with some of the best discs of Young's career, including \\"Zuma\\" and \\"Tonight's the Night.\\"<br /><br />Look out, though: For fans of prettified Neil, this ain't \\"Harvest\\" or \\"Silver and Gold.\\" Yet it isn't nearly as noisy as \\"Zuma\\" or as raw as \\"Tonight's the Night,\\" either. The first half of the album is witty, bizarre and very entertaining; the songs include \\"See the Sky About to Rain\\" and the hoarse but heartfelt \\"For the Turnstiles.\\"<br /><br />The second half (side 2, back in vinyl days) is simply one of the great turns in Young's career. \\"On the Beach,\\" \\"Motion Pictures\\" and \\"Ambulance Blues\\" constitute a trilogy of slow-tempo, reflective songs that nevertheless have tremendous emotional power and considerable darkness. In its way, each of these pieces also asserts Young's amazing independence as an artist. He will do things his own way, even if, at times, that stubborn insistence ends up irritating his collaborators and even his fans. The title track's lyrics perfectly encapsulate Young's love/hate relationship with stardom: \\"I need a crowd of people,\\" Young sings,\\" but I can't face them day to day.\\" Hell's bells, Neil ... who can? :) \\"Motion Pictures\\" is the gentlest of these three songs, and was dedicated to actress Carrie Snodgrass, with whom Young had a son, Zeke, but this isn't a simple romance ballad. A sample from the lyrics: \\"Motion pictures on my TV screen, / A home away from home, livin' in between.\\" The song, while clearly expressing love, also delves into self-doubt, the nature of stardom, and more.<br /><br />Finally, the album concludes with \\"Ambulance Blues,\\" one of the finest pieces of rock music I've ever heard. In it, Young addresses critics directly, calling them out for being no better than him or anyone else despite their haughty pronouncements. And there's a verse, repeated, that many feel directly referenced Richard Nixon, the disgraced politician who in 1974 became the only U.S. president ever to resign from office:<br /><br />\\"I never knew a man<br />could tell so many lies<br />He had a different story<br />for every set of eyes.<br />How can he remember<br />who he's talkin' to?<br />'Cause I know it ain't me,<br />and I hope it isn't you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ambulance Blues\\" doesn't end so much as it just stops, kind of falling apart musically with a sigh of harmonica and soft percussion. But it's a brilliant ending -- Young, despite all the issues he's addressed on this album, knows better to proclaim that he's resolved any great mysteries.<br /><br />Final note: Some reviewers here have complained that the DVD-Audio version of this album is presented in two-track (stereo) only. This was deliberate on Young's part, as he wanted the highest resolution possible for the two-channel mix. Thus, no surround here, which has irked some folks. Upon buying the disc and getting it home, I was perplexed and rather annoyed. Over time, though, I've come to appreciate it just the way it is. This is a stark, revealing mix of one of Young's most harrowing and yet winning albums. Highly recommended.r haughty pronouncements.

B004ZNARH4|4.0|I'm a Pink Floyd fanatic, or maybe I'm not ... I've never been thrilled with \\"The Final Cut\\" or, for that matter, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" The former is really a Roger Waters solo album masquerading as a PF album not long before he left the band. The latter is David Gilmour's baby, and while it's got some interesting music, lacks Waters' lyrical inventiveness.<br /><br />Then there's the Syd Barrett-led Floyd from 1968 or so, which only produced one album, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\" Barrett was a brilliant songwriter, or was most of the time; \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is brilliant, as are some other tracks here. But \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" bores the daylights out of me, and some of the other psychedelic overtones here result in this being an album that has not aged especially gracefully.<br /><br />After Barrett's drug use/madness drove him from the group, the band struggled through a few somewhat uninspired albums, including \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" and the \\"More\\" film soundtrack. \\"Meddle\\" and \\"Obscured by Clouds,\\" the two albums released just before \\"Dark Side,\\" hinted at some really good things to come.<br /><br />Then came the Floyd albums that defined the band for me: \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall.\\" Each of them quite different from the rest, each of them with its own considerable merits. \\"Animals\\" was about as noisy as the Floyd ever got, and \\"Sheep\\" and \\"Dogs\\" especially were great fun for their musical bite and lyrical nastiness. \\"The Wall\\" is probably the creepiest album of the four, and the one I identify with least ... but then again, I've never been a rock star who's coming apart at the mental seams. That leaves \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and over the decades I've vacillated between the two when trying to decide which is Pink Floyd's best album.<br /><br />So ... as I said, I'm a Floyd fanatic, or maybe I'm not. I will say this: I don't appreciate being sold a box set as expensive as the Dark Side \\"Immersion\\" box that has so many packaging problems. I was absolutely HORRIFIED when I saw the contents of my first copy. The two discs in cardboard sleeves were fine, but the four that were supposed to be on spindles had ALL come loose during shipping. Two were badly scraped and scratched, and the other two showed slight damage.<br /><br />I am glad I ordered from amazon. I let them know via the Web site about the problems; they shipped out a new copy almost immediately. Out of caution, though, I held onto the first one until the second arrived, and it's a good thing I did: Again, the discs had slipped off their spindles, or in this case three of them had. Fortunately, using the two sets, I was able to piece together four good discs, not counting the ones in sleeves, and shipped the worst of the lot back.<br /><br />This just shouldn't happen with a set this expensive, but at least the retailer made good on it. I've also read some pretty scathing criticisms of the 2011 vinyl version of DSOTM, so maybe it is true that quality control on this whole project wasn't what it should have been.<br /><br />As for the contents: I was very, very skeptical that anything here could surpass the 2003 SACD mixed for 5.1 by James Guthrie. Indeed, the disc labeled DVD-Audio didn't come close, in my opinion, or rather, just didn't sound to me like there was any noticeable improvement. I'm a surround geek; my system plays SACDs, DVD-Audio discs and blu-rays, including blu-ray audio. I've listened to a lot of surround mixes over the years despite the general failure of such formats in the marketplace.<br /><br />Without expecting much, I listened to the blu-ray audio disc included in the Immersion Box. I must say it has its own merits. As one of the band members points out in the 2003 documentary (I think it was Rick Wright), there are tubular bells on \\"Brain Damage.\\" I have good ears but I'd never heard them, even on the SACD version. I played back the DVD-A version of \\"Brain Damage\\" included here; still didn't ring any bells. But the blu-ray did. They're very faint, but I can hear them. And overall, the blu-ray mix is very, very good. Basic difference for me: I think the lows and mid-range are slightly superior on the SACD, with the highs being clearer on the blu-ray mix.<br /><br />That still wouldn't be enough for me to award this box four stars despite its shoddy packaging. But the inclusion of the quad mixes and Alan Parsons' alternate mix are definitely interesting to hear.<br /><br />You've got to be pretty crazy for the Floyd to buy this, but for those interested in the history and development of this album, there's enough here. Now, back to that packaging issue: Thank God, the powers that be corrected the problems with the Immersion version of \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"faint, but I can hear them.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love the Harry Potter series and own every book and movie so I was waiting quite impatiently for this last movie to come out on DVD to complete my collection.  For me, it is going to stay with me forever.  I have yet to tire of watching the movies or reading the books.<br /><br />This movie is dark, so you have to watch it in the dark to get the best view.  But it's amazing.  I think they did a brilliant job of transferring the main themes of the book ending into the movie.  They put some of my favorite scenes which makes it even better!  And the acting is superb.  When it ended, I was a little sad because that means its finally over.  It has been an amazing journey.
1419702238|2.0|Let me start out by saying this:  It's not the best Wimpy Kid book ever.  I felt that it had barely any action or exciting events.  It also seldom had parts that made you feel for Greg (aka Wimpy Kid).<br /><br />Great beginning, it does make you wonder what's going to happen next.  On the other hand, the ending was disappointing.  It did not resolve one of the main problems, neither did it wrap-up the whole book.<br /><br />My advice is to really look into it before purchasing.
0743297334|4.0|What you have to realize before picking up this book is that it is literary fiction -- that is, the focus of the novel is on character development and setting, rather than simple genre formats like romance, thriller, etc.   That being said, The Sun Also Rises is a fantastic book. Many people hesitate to pick up classics from authors like Faulkner, Wolff, or Bronte because they are wordy or slow reads -- but Hemmingway is the exact opposite. Gone are long winded descriptions of characters and setting; the prose is stripped down the most minimal form. Yet the brevity of the sentences has a strange beauty, and the staccato prose is strung together into vivid imagery and realistic dialogue.  The strength of this novel lies in its characters and their conversation. Their interactions continually push the story forward while giving value insight into the speaker's past.   On the other hand, the novel starts off quite slowly, and it can be difficult to get past the first third. Once Jake leaves Paris and travels to Spain, the story becomes a bit more interesting. If you are looking for an action packed thriller or juicy romance, you won't find anything here. What you will find are a colorful set of characters, from great friends to bitter enemies. You become connected to Jake and his struggles with the elusive Brett, his un-acheivable love. You feel yourself in the colorful hills of Spain and in amongst the streets of Pamplona.   If you can get past the slow start, and look at the beauty of what Hemmingway has created with such a different writing style, you will appreciate this book. Whether you are studying the writing itself, or just wan't to enjoy a classic, The Sun Also Rises will not dissapoint.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is a good movie. Pity it is so hard to see anything.  THE SECRET: WATCH IT IN TOTAL DARKNESS!  Leave your screen with the usual settings, and just turn off ALL the lighting. NOT most of it ALL of it.  Then you can see the movie. Most of the movie is very dark, or at night. So the very few bright scenes may be too bright for a few seconds with all the lights off, but at least you can see all the dark scenes. of which the vast majority of the important stuff is done in.  The company which made the transfer should be ashamed of themselves for the poor job they did.  Also be aware plenty of minor glitches in brightness, as if Macrovision foulups..  So aside from the idiots who produced the DVD, and the idiot who decided to make the whole movie awash in sepia tones.. It is a good movie.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|I totally enjoyed Carey's 1994 Merry Christmas and was thrilled to find Merry Christmas 2 You going for a single digit in a bargain bin.  While the 2010 Yuletide album does not surpass the original, it comes pretty close. Merry Christmas 2 You puts various musical genres to good use. Oh Santa! is a pulsating number that makes me want to shake that booty. Christmas Time Is In The Air Again recreates the old fashioned jazz feel. Here comes Santa Claus goes Hip Hop while Auld Lang Syne turns into an Ibiza dance anthem.  Carey's whispery vocals are great on O Little Town Of Bethlehem and she simply soars on the traditional O Come All Ye Faithful.  Two tracks from the previous holiday CD are rehashed. O Holy Night is sung live and a re-recorded version of All I Want For Christmas Is You with slight variations.  This would be a great gift for Cameron Diaz, but she might ask for a refund. Haha, just kidding.(There's a story on Diaz's reaction to Carey's music)

Not to mention the free access to the online map that makes searching for a specific thing much easier.<br /><br />This guide is surely a collector's treasure that will surely satisfy. I call this book Skyrim 101 since it's so big that you can teach a class with it.

The old saying \\"You get what you pay for\\" is absolutely true in this case.

It is no easy task to read, it can mess with your head, it requires time and focus, read the footnotes! Some of his best work is there. Many different points of view and situations occur at once in perfect harmony. Wallace's work is some of the best I have read. This novel is no easy read. You will find yourselfe re-reading page after page to understand, once you do it's truly thought provoking.
0385342055|1.0|I warn you now that there are spoilers in this review.  Who wants to read a book in which Becky Bloomberg doesn't shop? I don't understand what brought the author to that decision. So, no shopping, just Becky whining because she has to wear her \\"old\\" wardobe.  Minnie is an obnoxious child -- but she turns out to be normal toddler! Yeah, right. So this thread of the book goes nowhere.  Becky's mother is a fine warning of what Becky might become, but she's not an interesting character and very unpleasant.  The buying a house theme becomes very dull -- they just can't get exactly what they want and Becky lies and lies and gets herself into a pickle. Who cares?   Becky nearly destroys her husband's secretary's career bec she has a fantasy that she can manipulate Luke through her. Is this comic?  The only funny element is the \\"private shopping.\\"  And let's not forget that Becky's big crisis is that she can't manipulate the world to put on a huge party for Luke without him finding out and without spending any money. She makes it into a big issue of everyone not believing in her, etc., when, in fact, she isn't capable of what she is trying to do, so they are right. Of course, the usual solution to problems in this series arrives: someone very rich foots the bill and smooths things out for Becky.  I cannot imagine why Kinsella thought it would be fun to place Becky's antics against the background of people losing all their money in bank failures. Perhaps Kinsella is too rich herself to understand how terrifying the economic situation for most people is nowadays. It was bad taste and a poor comic choice.

Being so wrapped up in the book, I didn't expect book 3 to be any less.  It did keep me on the edge of my seat, I just don't think it was as well written as the first 2 books.  Regardless of the ending.  Granted, I think what happens in the \\"future\\" at the end of the book should have gotten a little more detailed, but I'm glad there was something there.    And there is a catch... if you read the first two books, and loved them... you can't possibly not read the 3rd book, no matter what the reviews say.

Young adult fiction is classified as being for 14-21 year olds.  I for one would have never wanted to read this book at the age of 14.    I loved the book and would highly recommend it.
B002ECEJ3G|4.0|I don't like modernism as a general rule, my modernist class this year is trying to change that, but unless you're Conrad, you don't really stand much chance.  However, there are passages in the novel which are truly stunning, especially in the third portion of the book. Woolf has a wonderful way with words about her. The thing about the book that clung to me the most is the idea of identity.  Identity is what other people label our souls.  Mrs. Ramsay, for instance, is labeled: wife, mother, hostess, daughter. None of these are labels which she has given herself. When she is in those moments of alone she faces this blackness which is really what we are without the identity which others have given us.  I liked this one and if you are looking for a slower read (really emphasize \\"slower\\") which has some pretty deep currents this one will work perfectly.
B005I6EU48|5.0|This is a nice cover feels good in your hands. The spine is a dark tan color which I couldn't see in the photo before purchase. At first the red and tan looked sort of odd to me but it grew on me in the hour or so I had it out of the box.<br /><br />The corner straps that will hold your device in place are well built. They have heavy elastic (well anchored) on one side and on the other there is a grippy-gel stuff that keeps things from even thinking about slipping.<br /><br />I was surprised by how you could fold the front completely around to the back for one-handed reading.<br /><br />Nice to hold, look at and use.
B0058ZPNOK|3.0|This film is extremely disturbing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a foul mouthed street person who shuns all forms of main stream society.  Director, Spencer Susser, also seems to shun main stream movie making in introducing one the most interesting and offensive anti-heroes of all time.  Imposing himself on a dysfunctional family that has not been able to overcome the loss of daughter, wife and mother, Hesher (Gordon-Levitt) becomes an influential force in their journey back from the edge.  Natalie Portman has a limited but extremely well acted role as part time store cashier who does not make enough money to pay the rent, buy food and repair a seriously past its prime auto.  Many viewers may be put off by the language and some of the actions of the main character but the message at the end is clear and offers some amount of hope for a group of hopeless people.

B005HT400A|4.0|David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet\\" (1986) is a surreal tale that takes place in a small lumber town which has the big city problems of murders, and gangs. Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) discovers the dark side of the town as he investigates the mystery behind a human ear he finds in a field.<br /><br />This blu-ray appears to be the same master as the Special Edition dvd that came out in 2002, but now seen in 1080p. Though what this blu-ray has over past releases is 50 minutes of newly discovered footage, whereas the 2002 dvd Special Edition only had about 9 minutes of still photographs that approximated the lost footage. Lynch had shot about four hours of film, which he then trimmed down to two hours for the final cut of the film. Two other things the blu-ray has over the Special Edition dvd are a few outtakes, and four vignettes, including the story behind the robin at the end of the film, which isn't what I thought it was. As in the 2002 Special Edition dvd set there is the review by Siskel and Ebert, and a documentary which is over one hour long called \\"Mysteries of Love\\".

0321704452|5.0|Within \\"Naked Presenter,\\" Garr Reynolds teaches you how to present from your naturalist state by using your passion and being simple when creating your slides. He refers to being naturally naked, which is referring to being relaxed, contemplated, and connecting with the natural surroundings.  Reynolds uses ten P's for presenting which are:  preparation, punch, presence, projection, passion, proximity, play, pace, participation, and power.  It is a great read and is helpful to users when trying to prepare for a presentation.

B005NPLXJ4|3.0|Had this been simply a Lou Reed album, it would have come and gone with minimal notice. Critics who love Lou Reed would have praised it, and the rest would have dismissed or ignored it. Metallica's involvement changes everything, except for one: This is still primarily a Lou Reed album. Lou Reed fans are going to get exactly the kind of thing he's been doing since the mid-seventies. Unfortunately for Metallica fans, they are going to get that very same thing. If you're a fan of the former, by all means, pick this up. There's plenty to enjoy here on that basis. Metallica fans, meanwhile, need to wade in with their eyes wide open if they choose to dip their toes at all. This isn't easy swimming for anyone who cut his teeth on Master of Puppets or And Justice for All.

B00008WJBU|4.0|This Movie is fairly original in its premise; luck is real and like a commodity can be given, and sold to the point that one gambles for others' luck.<br /><br />Samuel (Max von Sydow) a concentration camp survivor discovers the secret of luck and how it is obtained and used. His prot&eacute;g&eacute; Federico decides to leave and use his own luck in his own way. So Samuel dissen-lucks Federico with a quick hug, and a peck, sending him on his way.<br /><br />So now Federico must find some luck and return for the showdown.  Can he do it? We see what he must go through with a new found down-on -his-luck lucky person.<br /><br />You have to pay attention at all times to this movie as whatever looks  just incidental for ambience may just  actually be part of the clues for the future or the past however you look at it. Also the pacing is just a tad off, however you will get used to it. There is a little bit of blood but nothing gratuitous. You may have to get used to the subtitles as a speech is just a tad too fast to assimilate without them.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity a second viewing is worth it.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|The Marware cover arrived last week; the Kindle Fire yesterday afternoon.  Removed the styrofoam from the Microshell Folio, examined case.  Assembly looks effective.  Snapped Kindle Fire into Folio Cover after removing KF shrink wrap, plugged charger into mini usb port, folded elastic band over cover and let charge on desk with illuminated charging light facing me so I could tell when it went to green, meaning fully charged.  All within about an hour.  Opened up KF, proceeded to register and sync.  The Marware Graphite case works. Period.  Amazon has dropped the initial price to $30 bucks; like others I paid around $40.  Then, yesterday, Amazon sent me an email saying a $10 credit had been applied to my account for use on next order.    Am I happy with the case?  You bet.  I have carefully looked through many of the 1 star and 2 star comments; must say I don't get the criticism.  I own a lot of gadgets and usually if it is casable, I case it up.  For example my 18month old Motorola Droid X smartphone is in an Otterbox case.  The only point here is that cases are often of varying quality and at various price points.  This one works and does what it says.  My only cautionary, realistically, is that I am writing this one day after suiting up the KF with this cover.  Get back to me in six months and we can have a long term confab.  But for now, this thing offers better protection against the normal wear and tear that glass covered devices encounter in everyday use.  I expect it to do its job.  No more.  And certainly, no less.
1451648537|3.0|It's possible to approach this doorstep-size book from two angles: (i) what we learn about Jobs the man, and (ii) how Isaacson's account fairs as 'an exclusive biography' of Jobs. Of course, both views are equally important and can go together, but I think there's a different reading experience to be had by approaching this material from either one side or the other depending on one's expectations.<br /><br />First, the man. Steve Jobs was undoubtedly special. He lived 56 years, built and restored a multi-billion dollar company, and was a millionaire at 25. He was also an adopted son (abandoned or predestined?) and a very complex person. For example, Jobs was, by all accounts, frequently arrogant, brutal, controlling, difficult, extreme, focused, grumpy, idealistic, manipulative, needy, opinionated, petulant, quirky, rude, smart, tough, useful, volatile and wiry irrespective of person or context. Notably, there's no obvious mention of love, kindness, patience, forgiveness and repentance in Isaacson's or other people's vocabulary for characterizing Jobs. I'm tempted to conclude that if, as Jobs said, \\"the journey [in life] is the reward\\" it's difficult to ascertain how the means could ever have justified his demeanour. Indeed, even Isaacson remarks \\"The nasty edge to [Jobs'] personality was not necessary\\" (p. 565).<br /><br />Second, Isaacson's privileged access to information and Jobs' cooperation are immensely important in telling his story which ends (perhaps respectfully) with his resignation as Apple CEO on 24 August 2001, six weeks before his passing. Isaacson's writing is clear and approachable but the vast majority of the text is descriptive, factual and flat. That said, Isaacson is occasionally critical of his subject matter and the final chapter, LEGACY, provides a summary, and some analysis and interpretation.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed by what I learnt about Jobs the man. He was rich, powerful, and influential but hardly a role model morally and spiritually. Then again, `Think Different' (Apple's self-aggrandising mantra) doesn't have to mean `think and act like Jobs'. As for the book I believe there's room in the market for a sharper-edged, full analysis that puts Jobs' life and achievements in better-defined cultural, historical, social, economic and political contexts that go well beyond the United States and American points of view.hink Different' (Apple's self-aggrandising mantra) doesn't have to mean `think and act like Jobs'.

0439023521|2.0|There is nothing really wrong with this book.  Like, I mean, its not like I was really offended by it or anything.  I mean, Collins is a passable writer, she definitely had a vision, she took her characters where she wanted to go and she followed her theme through to the end.  But for me, the story rang hollow.  There was nothing to it.  The characters were shallow, uninteresting, and for the most part, blandly generic.  We are told who they are more than shown.  Katniss is not necessarily annoying, but her character is not really compelling.  We are told she is, we are told that people like her, we are told that she forms relationships, but never do we get any evidence besides the author directly speaking to us to prove that she is any of those things.  She is a character I have read before, blending into the likes of many other YA female protagonists.  I found it difficult to find her relationships believable.  I mean, she tells us she loves her sister, but their interactions are small enough that I am forced to take the authors word for it.  The same goes for the \\"love triangle.\\"  Her interactions and thoughts about Gale are stale and limited enough that I found myself baffled as to why Collins thought her readers would think there was anything more there than bland friendship.  And Peeta is a tool.  He is the vessel through which the reader is supposed to see Katniss's character, and understand that she really is a cool person who is loved and respected by a lot of people.  It felt too contrived, to forced.  And the story was predictable.  I could predict most of the main plot points from how the games were going to go, to how the love story was going to go.  It was all very paint-by-numbers to me.  I think for me the hardest part was being made to feel like I had to feel a certain way.  Like, the Capital is mean because Katniss says it is, and also, they do mean things.  Like, these mean evil games.  And like, Rue is a cool person because she reminds Katniss ofher sister, who we are told is a cool person.  And like, Peeta is a nice person, because Katniss says he is.  And also, like, he loves her an stuff.  And of course, Katniss is super talented and smart and such, and also she can make people like her because she has a spark or something.  Which of course, being humble and such, she does not see.    I guess in the end, it could have been a compelling story, and I think that Collins really had a good idea.  Even her characters could have had potential, and in the hands of another author, maybe a truly gripping story would have been produced.  But as it stands, I see no need to read the other two stories.  The Wikipedia summaries are enough for me--especially as they confirm my predictions.

B00007KWHO|4.0|Time And A Word (1970) was the second Yes album and the last with Peter Banks as guitarist.  This 2003 re-issue contains four bonus tracks - \\"Dear Father\\", \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\" (Original Mix), \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (Original Mix), and \\"The Prophet\\" (Single Version).  My two personal favorites on this album are \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"Astral Traveller\\".  This album was the last album to feature the original Yes lineup of Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Peter Banks, Chris Squire, and Tony Kaye.  Peter Banks was fired after this album was recorded, but before the album was released.  He was replaced by Steve Howe.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great album from Yes, the masters of progressive rock.  Highly recommended.

0307473473|5.0|After hearing David Fincher was doing a movie based on this book, I decided to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed. It is a well-written mystery about a girl's disappearance many years ago which turns into a present-day terror. While the mystery itself drives much of the plot, the fascinating characters are what really drives the novel. The \\"girl with the dragon tattoo\\" is Lisbeth Salander, an introverted, anorexic, expert hacker who gets categorized as troubled and sent to a children's psychiatric hospital. Even as a young adult she is considered legally incompetent; one of her appointed guardians takes advantage of her sexually. Lisbeth is no weakling though and can be dangerous in self-defense. Despite some of her methods, it's easy to empathize with Lisbeth and cheer her on - in many ways she's a victim herself but she refuses to act like one.<br /><br />In some ways, the main character in the novel is actually Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist facing libel charges related to an article written for his magazine \\"Millennium\\". Just like Lisbeth, Mikael has his own flaws which helps make him feel real. Mikael receives an odd job offer from Henrik Vanger, the aged former CEO of a large corporation. Henrik wants Mikael to look into the decades old disappearance of his niece Harriet, whom Henrik believes was murdered by a family member. At first Mikael dismisses Henrik's suspicions, but before long he too gets wrapped up in the case. Discovering a number of new leads, eventually he enlists the help of Lisbeth after learning of how she was able to research Mikael's background for Henrik before he was hired. The story picks up a lot of steam with the new developments and includes some interesting twists. Overall I found the novel very enjoyable, even after I was able to predict part of the ending. There was more than enough to maintain my interest with the varied characters and plot twists.

B005I6EU48|5.0|This looks and feels even better than I expected...I know it's not real leather, but it's soft and doesn't have a vinyl look (or smell) at all. I always look at stitching on things like this as a measure of quality, and it is flawless.  The bands are snug but I didn't feel like I was overstretching them, and the Fire feels very secure in the case. The microfiber inside is soft and lint-free. The cover did not close flat immediately (something I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't read the other reviews), but after leaving it face-down for a few hours it is perfect.  The contrasting tan color of the spine complements the red very nicely, and I love having a Kindle that now looks and feels very much like a quality antique book.

B003YOZNBU|4.0|Although I typically don't like comic book heroes portrayed in movies, I liked Jonah Hex.  But I also never heard of the comic book so I had no idea what the character should be like.  This movie satisfied my personal criteria for what makes a movie enjoyable - It was entertaining with something interesting always going on and it had a recognizable and likable cast that could act: John Malkovich, Aidan Quinn, Josh Brolin, Megan Fox.  I too am a traditional western genre fan with Silverado being my all time favorite, but it's also intriguing to see something done that's different without being totally ridiculous as Wild Wild West from 1999 surely was. So if you're a dyed-in-the-wool classic westerns fan, Jonah Hex might not be for you.  But if you're open to pushing the envelope a bit but in a serious rather than humorous way, then give Jonah Hex a chance.
1451627289|5.0|I just closed the book. Wow. What a read. What a ride. I will avoid spoilers at all costs and I'm positive that many reviews will cover what I will write, but this book captured my attention from page one and I enjoyed all the way through King's final thoughts on page 849.   Jake Epping is a school teacher who has a friend that owns a diner in Lisbon Falls, Maine. His friend has a secret that he needs to pass on to someone and Jake is the person who can handle the secret. Jake Epping will go back in time to save JFK from assassination, but along the way Jake Epping finds that history that has been created does not easily change. He goes back to 1958 to start an adventure that begins in his hometown, but clearly drives him towards Dallas, Texas in November of 1963. The adventure, the fun, the romance, the suspense, the experience that Jake Epping goes through is incredible. This is Stephen King at his best. While reading I could almost sense the world of the late 1950s with the cars, the culture, the language, the music and the people of that era.   The main character struggles to survive in a new world of 1958 and the obstacles and the people he encounters make this an incredible novel. King handles the idea of time travel brilliantly throughout the book as Jake Epping tries to explain to you (and me) what happened and why and the consequences of changing events in history and the impact it has on the future.   The book is excellent. It was a bit slow at times (it is almost 900 pages....it can't all be fast paced, right?), but I savored every page. I felt like I was there when Epping first sees Oswald or when Epping begins to fall in love with a small town Texas girl.   This is Stephen King at his best. This is a book I will not soon forget. Thank you, Stephen King....wow, what a read and what a finish to the book. No spoilers....just read this book and enjoy every page of it.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Well, i actually think, that this album deserves only 4 - 4.5 stars, not classic but is close thoug. But i giving it 5 stars just to support this album, because is a great album, and i hate to read some low stupid reviews critizing the fact that this album is too soft and has a deep blend of R&B, like they never heard drake before, this isnt nothing new, all his past albums are the same, and i like this genre, also like pure hip hop, but im not going to compare the two genres. So to resume it, if you like this blend of Hip hop and r&B chek this album, if you dont, please go elsewhere.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|Like many people have pointed out, this comes with a \\"digital copy\\" by UltraViolet. While I disagree with some of the reviewers here, they are mostly right. You CAN download the movie (up to 5 times including a copy on my Droid phone), and UltraViolet says it is for offline viewing, but you HAVE to have an internet connection to access the damned file. This is BS! This is the LAST Warner Brothers DVD I buy. I have avoided pirating for YEARS, but now will get my Warner Brothers stuff that way. I will NOT PAY to be ripped off by some crap media company. You want me to buy your products, then give me an honest product. Message to multimedia conglomerates: When you RIP PEOPLE off, it should not longer be a crime to \\"steal\\" from you. Fines and prison times if we copy your movies, but what happens to you when you rip off millions of buyers? \\"Ooops\\". I will never again tell someone they shouldn't steal music or movies....since this is how they treat the consumer! Movies are great, I'm just REALLY peaved about the disk I can't return with the rip-off \\"digital copy\\". Should have \\"listened\\" and waited for the UK version.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|After reading a lot of incredibly boring books recently, I chose this one because of all the hype surrounding it. I was vaguely aware of the premise, and found it interesting enough to give it a try. However, I was sorely disappointed. The book was incredibly boring, long drawn out, and overly predictable. Too much of the book is spent droning on with filler - basically ridiculously over descriptive (you'll be provided with the details of every meal the protagonist eats, every day, throughout the entire story) - and once you get into the middle of the book, the pages are almost interchangeable with regards to the evens that take place. The premise is a little unbelievable, the main character is overly-oblivious, and it seems like the author changes the rules of her \\"world\\" based on the direction she wishes the story to take, rather than writing the story within the parameters of the world. Basically if you have any taste for real literature, and you're not a pre-teen, you're not going to enjoy this book.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones series is a colossal waste of time.  I am ashamed to admit I read all five books, constantly hoping they would get better.  It's a sad comment on my dogged persistence in the face of overwhelming evidence.  I enjoyed J. R. Tolkien's Hobbit/Lord of the Rings  and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and their ilk immensely and was sad to see each end.  Mr. Martin's greatest talent lies in convincing the reading public to purchase his stories.  Martin takes an interesting theme and that should have been well handled in 400-500 pages and balloons it through five books.  He constantly introduces new characters and locations throughout the meager plot thread that are never seen or heard from again thus expanding his page count to no purpose.  To say this is bad literature is too kind; it's horrible.  I bought the series from Amazon for my Kindle.  I wish there was some way to get my money back.
B00005LOUP|1.0|OK, forgive me for getting on a soapbox here, but it really does astound me as to somebody like Ron Howard (himself a former child actor), with his partner Brian Grazer, can have such a rock-solid reputation behind an eclectic mix of films that ARE very insightful, poignant and sometimes hilarious (Splash, Parenthood, Backdraft, A Beautiful Mind, the upcoming J. Edgar, and even the Friday Night Lights TV series), but yet, when it coomes to kids and families, really does have a pretty dismal track record (The Cat in the Hat, which was directed by Howard's \\"Grinch\\" production designer Bo Welch, and Problem Child 1 and 2. IMdB wouldn't say it, but at least Entertainment Weekly said that his production company was behind the latter two).  At least it really is great to see he has a daughter who's now a bona fide movie actress. However, apparently, it does look like Howard himself still has a lot of growing up to do (and not just with his movies in the former for that matter neither).  My point? When it comes to kids and families, they really do deserve better, geared at them, instead of a crappy send-up that not only flushes the memory of everyone's childhood memories down the tubes, but also trashes the legacy of one the world's most beloved children's authors.  * out of *****, period.

B005NQ94KS|4.0|I loved David Nicholls' book of the same name.  I love the work of Lone Scherfig ([[ASIN:B00068S3IM Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself]], [[ASIN:B00006ADFP Italian for Beginners]]).  David Nicholls wrote the screenplay.  The ever-lovable Anne Hathaway stars in it.  This combination seemed like it added up to sure-fire box office success.  I saw the movie in a sneak preview and thought it delivered on all that promise.  To me, Nicholls had successfully boiled the essence of his novel into two hours of tight story-telling.<br /><br />So much for sure-fire success: 'One Day' bombed at the box office.  There's no way to finesse that - you don't make a movie with names of this caliber, come away with less than $14 million in U.S. box office receipts, and pronounce yourself pleased with the results.<br /><br />Why the pratfall?  I can think of a short list of things:<br /><br />1) NOT your typical Rom-Com: Those who went thinking they'd get a light Rom-Com were in for a shock.  There's a far deeper, more serious tale taking place here.<br /><br />2) Stunning, abrupt denouement: The twist of fate that suddenly befalls Hathaway's Emma isn't something mainstream U.S. audiences would expect of their romantic lead.<br /><br />3) Dexter's sliding likability: Jim Sturgess's Dexter starts off likable - he's the popular man on campus.  Nicholls' book tracks Dexter's 20-year slide to dissolution, while Emma's path inexorably arches upwards past him, from ugly duckling to attractive, winsome success (Anne Hathaway's calling card for over a decade).

B0000C9ZBW|4.0|This watch is a great balance of everyday and too nice to wear everyday. It looks great and for the price it is a good buy. I love the stainless weave strap it is comfortable and more size friendly than links, plus not pins to deal with in sizing.  Only downside is the adjustment knob can poke at the wrist a little, not so much for sports wear.

0307887898|4.0|First of all, any book that can get executives to do more customer testing is a good book. Anyone who reads even a fraction of this book will go away understanding the need and benefits of doing that testing.<br /><br />The message here is sound, but the content delivery is immature. It is all too common in business books for the same point to be made over and over, without new justification or supportive material. This book is unfortunately no exception. The author is also prone to fall into the \\"it's about me\\" trap, which never impresses careful readers. A good editor would have trimmed 15-20% of the text with no loss to the reader whatsoever.<br /><br />Which gets me to the significant flaw. An important part of the message here is the lean mantra, \\"build-measure-learn.\\" At it's core, this is a great model, which even lean practitioners sometimes forget. But there's also a flaw here: the book places a strong emphasis on building things that can be tested by customers, and the customer response measured. What's not sufficiently covered is the necessary up-front diligence work to understand whether something should be built at all, and to set the initial direction. It is a silly waste of development resources (and cash) to build the wrong thing, then gradually turn that thing around to the right thing, instead of building the right thing in the first place (or building nothing, in some cases!)<br /><br />My point is this: It is quicker and far less costly to talk to customers, understand their needs, then test various versions of the solution on a whiteboard than to build something first. Unfortunately this book spends far too much emphasis on the build part, and not enough on the \\"before you build\\" part.<br /><br />I initially gave the book three stars for the reasons stated above. However, it is clear from the conversations going on among entrepreneurs at the time this is being written (November 2011) that this book is having a positive effect on the community, right now. Anybody who can convince as many entrepreneurs to spend more time testing with customers is creating positive change, so I've upgraded the review to four stars. And I'm keeping two copies on my shelf (one pre-release reviewer copy to loan out, one for myself).many entrepreneurs to spend more time testing with customers is creating positive change, so I've upgraded the review to four stars.

0451169514|3.0|I enjoyed this book, great characters and enjoyed getting to know each one.  Thought the ending was a little rushed, but loved the story about the kids growing up and the nostalgic aspect of this book.  I do wish the ending was explained a bit more... eg turtle. Some parts were hard to read, but I am pleased even though, that I read IT.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I was not very pleased with this cover, especially for the price.  Granted they did give me a $10 credit because they dropped the price but this was a gift and for $40 I expected something a bit more durable.  I will say the kindle fits in there nice and snug--a HUGE plus and the bottom polycarb seems like it will take some abuse, but the top cover does not give the impression that it will and if that is the case it does not matter HOW durable the bottom portion is.  Even with the kindle in the holder, I cannot get the stand to work properly.    The frustrating thing was I got this as a gift for my deploying spouse to have while gone for several months and now there will not be enough time to get a nicer cover.  Guess I should have read the product reviews better.  I think it will serve the purpose overall, but I would have rather paid and additional $5 (from the original price) for the much nicer leather holder that is now available, but was not available when I pre-ordered.
B005GP7F8Y|3.0|I just watched the blu-ray version I received from Amazon. First of all, the case was not sealed, indicating it had been opened. A return? Second, it was skipping a lot, so I took it out and cleaned it with a wet tissue. It ran OK after that.     I have two other non blu-ray versions of this film,including one advertised as the best transfer, and this one is the best in picture sharpness, though the color is a bit washed out and the soundtrack is mediocre. It is also full screen. The musical soundtrack of this movie is one of the best, most romantic of all westerns, and it's unfortunate the sound is not better.   This is a great movie--one of Brando's many great roles. In his prime, and with all his girlfriends playing small parts (count them). He said the girls were the only thing he remembered about the movie. He and his leading lady, Pina Pellicer, have great chemistry, and their love scenes are very moving--complemented beautifully by Friedhofer's great music.Friedhofer, by the way, did the orchestrations for the music in \\"Casablanca.\\"  I think I reviewed this movie previously in one of the non blu-ray versions, so I won't repeat myself. I'm satisfied with this blu ray version because the picture is sharp and full screen. Both important because of the exquisite views and photography of the Monterrey coast. Seeing this film again, I was also struck by the superb acting performances of the supporting cast beyond Brando--Malden,Johnson, Pickens, Pellicer, Jurado et al. Perhaps influenced by Brando's directing. Malden, by the way, received star billing with his friend Brando in the screen credits--and deserved it.

B005K17RU0|1.0|I am a fan of Accuweather's web site, especially the hourly reporting.  I downloaded and installed this on a new Kindle Fire.  At first, after entering my location, all I got was a blank screen, and the app (but not the Fire) became unresponsive to any input. I had to force the app to stop via settings.  I later got it to accept a location, and the information came up and seemed to work great until I viewed a radar map. At that point it froze the entire Fire. The map was showing, but there was no response. Even the clock stopped. The power button would not even work.  I went to the Kindle Support web site and eventually found that you can force a shutdown by holding the power button for 20 seconds.  I will not try this app again unless/until Accuweather addresses this issue for the Fire.

B0055MBQOM|1.0|Not only does this not really work, it takes up Gigabytes of Real Memory and their customer service is horrible. If this was actually calibrating the screen, wouldn't the results after a calibration be the same exact result as the one after that and after that? but no, calibration is always different after running the display munki, sometimes, really bright, other times with high contrast, which tells me at any given moment someone may think they're working with a calibrated display and then they realize that it's just a random integer. My eyes could probably do a better job then this thing.<br /><br />Honestly not worth the money and as for the bugs in Lion where it constantly eats CPU when it calibrates the display for the light meter, I called in and had the worst customer experience. Their solution for me was to not use the software until they fixed it *which means it was pointless to use the hardware). Another email I got asked me to collect some system logs and samples of what was going on. I followed the steps and sent in the requested information. I waited a week for a response back, something like, we're aware of this situation and are working on it.  Since they didn't create support for Lion in the MANY MONTHS it's been in beta and in Gold Master release, I would assume that they were just waiting until my return policy let up. I am returning my device tomorrow, and will see if they honor the money back. Of course the money it takes to send it to them is on me, making me loose that amount.<br /><br />Complete SCAM!<br /><br />And then when I called to return it, they kept asking me why I wanted to return it and couldn't find my order until they realized that their Pantone department might have something on my case, and they did. Honestly these people are from New Jersey and it seems like it's run like the jersey shore.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or your time with this one, any of the other positive reviews were completely misleading.  if you want true calibration, you're going to have to find a very high end device and I would steer clear of X-rite or pantone as they are one in the same.to find a very high end device and I would steer clear of X-rite or pantone as they are one in the same.
B003L77G2Y|2.0|Before I give my review, I have to say that I am a \\"Fringe\\" fan. Even though I started watching during season 2 and then watching season 1, I quickly fell in love with those two seasons. They had excellent writing, good memorable characters, and a fascinating premise. I was so looking forward to season 3, but my hopes were dashed. The writing went downhill; characters stopped being as memorable; story lines were boring or didn't make any sense at all.  WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD  A big letdown for me was the characters. Olivia used to be interesting, but then she got all angsty, especially when she and Peter had their little spat. Walter used to be funny, but some of his actions and conversations came across as being forced and not as humorous as they used to be. Peter used to have that sarcastic likeableness about him, but I stopped liking him when he failed to differentiate between Olivia and Faux-livia. I have to say that Anna Torv did a very good job at portraying two different people; her demeanor and actions clearly made her two characters different.  While the season started off at a good pace, it got bogged down with some of its episodes. The first nine episodes were entertaining, but after that they became rather boring. I recall in seasons 1 and 2 where there were episodes not dealing with the overarching plot, but even then they were interesting. Even \\"Earthling\\" from season 2, which many fans dislike, was an interesting episode. The cases from season 3 were largely not interesting and dealt with some braniac or psycho trying to do something for good or for revenge. I miss season 1 episodes where several of them dealt with either the Pattern or a psycho experimenting on genetics or weapons who had a connection to the Pattern. Even season 2 had episodes with Newton and the shape-shifters, which were good. These episodes of just random braniacs in season 3 are not very interesting and not very gripping to me. The episode \\"Subject 13\\" looked like it was meant to be like season 2's \\"Peter,\\" but it failed to that standard. And \\"LSD\\" was bizarre and did not really seem to have any point, compared to \\"Brown Betty\\" which was a little weird but seemed to have a definite purpose in season 2.  Another disappointment were the story arcs of season 3. The season 2 finale promised an amazing storyline for season 3, especially with Peter and the doomsday machine and Walternate wanting to destroy the Blue Universe. The story arc, however, I was thought was a good concept but very poorly executed. It moved along at a pace that was way too slow, and too much was left unanswered. The season 3 finale did not tie up the loose ends very well, and I finished the episode thinking to myself \\"what the heck just happened? You spent an entire season building up to something, and we get this?\\" It was very poor writing, and I was not impressed, which was a shocker for me because I've loved \\"Fringe's\\" previous season finales. Then there were other minor story arcs that had no point or went on for way too long. The whole Faux-livia infiltrating Blue Universe and falling for Peter while our Olivia is brainwashed in Red Universe was too long and too drawn out; it should have ended earlier. The arc with Olivia hating Peter for sleeping with Faux-livia was rather overdramatic, and I did not sympathize with either side; it also became too dominant in the season where it should have been a more minor side plot. The arc with Bell possessing Olivia was stupid and did not seem to have any point; there was potential for Bell to help Fringe team with his knowledge of the Red Universe, but it was never used. The whole Faux-livia pregnancy arc was very predictable and ultimately did not have much of a point either, except serving as a rather complicated and unnecessary way to get Peter's DNA, Then there was the finale, which was drawn out too long over too many episodes; season 2 finale was much better in that each episode was independent but built up to an amazing finale- not so with season 3.  Another problem with the writing was how many threads were dropped. Peter's whole thing with killing the shape-shifters lasted only one episode and was never touched upon again. Alternate Charlie and Lincoln Lee becoming suspicious of Walternate was also brief. Faux-livia's kidnapping was never fully solved and the reasons for it were never given. There were others throughout season 3, but the dropped storylines really bothered me.   I had very high hopes for season 2, but I was rather underwhelmed by it. It started off strong, but after a few episodes, I got bored and disappointed with the season.

1582701709|1.0|About 2300 years ago Prince Siddhattha Gotama saw a an old man, a sick man and a dead man and concluded that he must leave his kingdom and devote his life to relieving the suffering of others. 300 years later, John the Baptish saw a hungry man with no coat and spent his life teaching that those with two must share with those with none.  5 years ago, Rhonda Byrne saw these things and concluded that these people were to blame for their own suffering because they refused to think positively.  She further concluded that if she ever wanted to win the lottery or lose those pesky holiday pounds that she would have to stay as far away from these depressing buzzkills as possible 'cause they would only bring her down.    I think that pretty much says it all.
B001GAOY5U|3.0|The Journey to the Center of the Earth is an excellent and relaxing movie and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it twice before it would no longer play on my LG-590. I though that it may have been a player update but it did not play on my computer either.<br /><br />Barring a bad disk that is not worth the hassle of returning it, The movie reminds me of the 50's and 60's genre but with updated set once out of the \\"center of the earth\\". I still watch it when it comes on TV, but still all in all it is disapointing about the disk.<br /><br />I look for any debris and dust as I take very good care of my optical disks but found none.<br /><br />I Recommend the movie but buy it locally where you can take it back for an exchange if you wind up like me. It's just not worth my time and money to send it back. I'll wind up buying it locally at BB or TRGT.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars except for the disk failure.
B0065NAKRO|3.0|Among the few domino games available for the Kindle Fire, this one looked to be the best. But that's not saying a whole lot.   I enjoy the \\"point\\" games such as Muggins and All Fives, and this game's version of Muggins doesn't allow for a spinner. Or at least I couldn't play off of the double.  Also, game play could be easier. Each domino must be physically moved into play, rather than tapping the domino to put it in play.   Otherwise, the game does OK, giving me a domino game I can play on my Fire. But I will keep an eye out for a better one.

0451528956|3.0|Hands up if you knew this book was written by Robert Lewis Stevenson! I didn't. Here's another thing I didn't know: it's really short - almost a novella. One and a half trips to work, and it was over.     The book itself was okay, but would have been infinitely better had I read it with the right ambiance. Listening to this book on a car radio, whizzing down the highway at 70 mph in the morning sunlight does not do the book justice. Instead, one should listen to it on a dark night in a log cabin, by gas-lantern light. With such an ambiance, one might put oneself in the time period in which it was written, and loose oneself in the haunting imagery it tries to convey. Otherwise, I'm afraid that in this age of terrorism, school shootings, and lost innocence, Mr. Hyde seems like a pretty mellow guy.'

161293028X|4.0|This is a collection of 12 stories about the great detective.  They are well-written, and each one takes about an hour to listen to, which made them perfect for my one-hour commute.<br /><br />I'd never read any Sherlock Holmes, and I anticipated that the cases would be totally un-solvable.  But it turns out that the clues provided during the narrative are often quite revealing, and it's frequently possible to guess the ending.  This is particularly true of some stories, in which clues that were (I suppose) meant to be subtle to a British audience of the late 1800s, are now glaringly obvious.  One story, for example uses the initials \\"KKK\\" for an evil secret society.  `What could it be?' wonders sidekick Dr. Watson.  Of course, any US citizen today knows what those initials stand for.  However, although one can often guess the ending, it's tricky to catch all of the clues.  I kept myself entertained by trying to catch as many of the clues as I could.  I never managed to catch every one.<br /><br />One thing I'm curious about is how many of these stories were archetypes of their plots.  Several of the plots were very familiar to me because I'd seen or read similar stuff in movies & books.  But it occurred to me:  maybe these were the originals!  I don't know enough about mystery writing to know whether that's the case or not.

B0015DROBO|5.0|This Bossy Redhead happened upon this book by a recommendation from my husband. That in itself is a first. As an avid reader, I have had a list of \\"to read\\" longer than a mile for years. But this book was one of the few my husband read and he raved about it which truly piqued my interest. Although he had a hard cover edition, I had to get this series on my kindle because very often I am out and about with the kids and carrying my iPad with me makes it easy just to pull up whatever reading I have going at the time, OR, like tonight, I have insomnia and the back lit lighting of the white text on black background on the iPad makes for some nice middle of the night reading.<br /><br />This story is so intriguing that I literally devoured the series within a few days' time. From the very beginning I was pulled into the story and captivated by the very interesting but weird Lisbeth Salander. I am sad that the author is no longer alive because his writing style and stories are great. Normally I don't read those crime/mystery stories, but this is one well worth the read no matter what your favorite genre is. I highly recommend!

B005KELQEU|4.0|This does what it is supposed to. I don't think that this is really worth $19.99 but all of the kindle cases seem overpriced so I guess I can live with it.  What I didn't expect is how tight this fits.  The case itself is OK. It has slight padding inside to protect your Kindle Touch against scratches, but this thing won't protect it against being dropped.  The thing that got me though is how tight this fits around the kindle touch. My Kindle barely fits into the package. Do not think of putting anything else in there with it. It is so tight that I worry that the zippers might scratch the Kindle on the corners.

I don't care about Ultraviolet and never will. I can do whatever I want with my DVD (short of illegal copying); I can watch it when I want, loan it to others, or throw it away if I choose to.

The idea is interesting enough and the opening scene holds promise but I found it to be a lackluster presentation and after about 80 pages or so I gave up on the novel. It felt like a dumbed down novel in characters and plot demonstrations. Hard to go into more details without giving spoilers. If you want to see Follet at his height read PILLARS OF THE EARTH or THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE or THE KEY TO REBECCA. WHEN READ: November 2011; MY GRADE: C plus.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|7.1 Dolby digital Headphones are simply amazing.<br /><br />This was the first time I've ever experienced Surround sound.  They're a great pair of headphones, they make sound in movies, music and games simply unrivaled.  I've never tried Astros but the X41s are simply awesome.  These badboys are awesome for videogames.  Take BF3, Skyrim or Gears.  In BF3 the sniper rounds crack by and have startled me several times from how real they sound, in singleplayer games they immerse you in the atmosphere and don't let you go.  For gears they've helped me step my game up and wreck kids like it's cool.<br /><br />These are powered by AAA batteries but only 2.  The 2 will last you about 25-30 hours which isn't too bad.  You have the option with these to listen to either stereo or surround sound.  The headphones come with a Bass Boost button which I've noticed makes most games sound awesome while others worse.  I used to blast these things on Halo or Battlefield and you can go deaf from these if your not careful.  Take care of your eardrums and they'll take care of you.  Why do I say that?  On BF3 for example if your volume is too loud when firing any gun without base the guns sound almost lifelike, if you've ever fired a gun in real life and know how loud they are it's close to that; they'll vibrate your eardrums from how loud they are.<br /><br />I don't have very much to say about these except they're worth the price tag.  I plan to get the XP500s soon enough but I've been wanting to give my opinion on these for a while and havne't gotten around to it.  They're great for what they do and help me play better.  The only downside is when talking to people it's harder to hear small cues in the game like rocks being ruffled, grass, reloading, whistling of tank shells, the roaring of dragons, Arrows flying by, crunching of snow, etc.<br /><br />But besides minor static interference with other 2.4GHZ signals these are very good.  Oh by the way skeptical customers, alot of people complain about static with these but what most people don't understand is that these operate on the same radio frequency that your phone, microwave, and router operate on.  Otherwise just find a spot where away from your router or any other electronic device.What this means is that the radiation/alpha waves are interfering with each other.  And don't worry, as humans we're expose to radiation on a daily basis from TVs, lights, anything that produces heat is technically radation ;-)<br /><br />Anywho I hope you enjoyed this review and hopefully I helped.

B004EPZ08E|1.0|I was going to purchase the Blu-Ray/Digital Combo of this, but I noticed that it no longer supported iTunes Digital Copy.  That's the only reason I get a Blu-Ray Digital Combo pack is to have the option to stream things to my Apple TV and put on my iPhone or iPad.  Flixster app sucks.  I went ahead and bought it digitally.  It's ashamed because I really prefer Blu-Ray when I am at home, unfortunately not an option anymore.  The movie is great.  Buy it in iTunes if you want a digital copy!!!
B005L38QHA|5.0|I have to say, my husband and I really love this mouse.  It's a bit of a competition over who gets to use this mouse, and who has to use the Razr Naga that we have.  And that's not just because it's so pretty.  I'm going to buy him his own this Christmas, we love it that much.   We definitely both like the size and weight of this mouse much better.  This mouse is much larger than our other gaming mouse, and that means it's far easier for my husband to use with his large hands.  I have large hands for a woman, and while I can use either mouse comfortably for a couple of hours, this Steelseries mouse is more comfortable in hour three or four.  The setup was very easy and intuitive.  Since I had already set up a multibutton gaming mouse before, I was familiar with the concept of having so many buttons on a mouse, and was able to easily assign my favorite commands to the various buttons.  Setup took maybe 15-20 minutes for me total.  If you aren't used to this process, it might take you longer.    The software was built for WoW raiders, so it was easy to bind macros and actions to the various keys.  It really was flawless and intuitive integration.    The Steelseries' thumb keys are, honestly, an improvement over the Naga.  While in theory it sounds great to have 12 thumb keys on a mouse, in reality, it's not useful to accidentally ice block mid bossfight instead of casting your trinket cooldown.  Having only 4 thumb keys, I don't make any errors like that.  Plus the other mouse's thumb keypad is so small, my husband can't use it.  My husband can easily use the thumb keypad on this SteelSeries mouse.    After a solid few weeks of raiding with this mouse, my husband and I both give it five stars!  If I *had* to find something to complain about, it's that the red glow of the mouse is awfully inviting -- as though it's beckoning me to come play when I really should be vacuuming or folding the laundry.
B0015DROBO|2.0|This is a difficult story to simply \\"get into.\\" I would agree with those of you who say once you stick with it that the story will start rolling eventually. However, the only reason I have finished this book, the girl who played with fire, and have began reading the girl who kicked the hornets nest is purely out of my undying stubbornness. You see, in my haste, I purchased all three books based on all of the rave reviews, which is obviously my main mistake. Despite the fact I have a hard time stomaching the majority of the material in these books, I have continued to read based solely the principle that I will not purchase a book I will not read -- I kept reading.<br /><br />Before you judge this book based on my review, please keep in mind that I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan, I love all of the Twilight books, and the Hunger Games trilogy. I am a sucker for sci-fi and an impossible love story, the kind that never happens in real life. I want to feel happy after reading a book, not have nightmares... Yes, the girl with the dragon tattoo trilogy has left mental images that I would have been happy to live the rest of my life without.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have realized that it is my own fault that it is difficult to face the realism in this book. Many situations in this book have a real life-like feeling to them, almost too real. I suppose this is one of the main reasons I hated reading these books. I always want to see the best in people and hate knowing how unbelievably horrible people can treat each other. I wish I could just live in my never-happening Nicholas Sparks love stories but the cold hard truth is people suffer.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo -- Very Real -- still hated it.
B005JLN9ZI|2.0|This album seems to be more catered towards women. I'm not saying thats a bad thing, but i think Drake may as well go full R&B. i wanted a rap album and would be ok with 2-3 emotional songs but almost the entire album is emotional and R$B. Maybe it will grow on me, but at the moment, i'm not feeling the cd at all. it doesn't have that instant classic feel nor does it have a single song thats an instant smash hit. If Drake reads these comments, i suggest making 2 albums, 1 all R&B for those who like that and one Rap
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This is a rare beauty, I know some other buyers didn't like the fact that the only difference between this and the regular jewel case edition is just the presentation, but that's their fault for not reading the \\"small print\\" before buying lol. I'm the sort of guy who loves deluxe boxes and packaging, so I have no complaints whatsoever.  However!!! I do hate the fact that this Cd (unlike the subsequent editions of Two Towers and Return) didn't come with it's \\"respective\\" red picture-strip that reads The Fellowship of the Ring. So... The good news is that I made one of my ow in Photoshop, it looks awesome and I'm whiling to share it with you guys, Cause I'm a nerd with a good hart ;-) just leave a comment here with your mail, I'll send a jpg file.  One last thing, if you get the ultimate Complete recordings edition of this ( [[ASIN:B000BNI90O The Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring (The Complete Recordings)]] ) Don't throw this away, there are some major differences in some tracks that still makes this a must have.  Cheers.

B00004T0US|2.0|The only reason to listen to Moody Blue is to remember how ill Elvis Presley was from suffering from the debilitating effects of prolonged drug abuse when he recorded the songs that are found on this last recording of his life.

006113399X|3.0|I had just finished reading \\"What is mine\\" by Anne Holt when I saw \\"The Redbreast\\" in the local library. I found the beginning just as the cover described \\"like watching a hit movie\\", not a good movie. The beginning was exactly like a acclaimed movie I had recently seen that cut back and forth between characters and time in a way that made it very difficult to follow the plot. As it went on and I began to recognize the characters, it is a good and engaging plot and I cared about what happened to Harry and to Rakel and I really hated Bernt Brandhaug and Tom Waaler. Unfortunately, the errors bothered me. Several people have already mentioned the gun related errors. The one that bothered me the most was the continued reference to the importance of the Muslim holiday of Eid falling on May 17,2000, the Norwegian national holiday. Eid al Fitr is at the end of Ramadan, which was in December in 1999 and Eid was in January,2000. The Eid al Adha was in March in 2000 and 2001. Eid al Fitr did fall in May in 1987 and 1988. Islamic holidays are set by the Islamic calendar which is not the same as the Western calendar so it's valid plot device, but surely the author could have done some research and come up with a holiday that did fit the time period. All of the errors could have been quickly and easily researched using just the internet. I'm not sure that the quality of the plot and the writing makes up for the lack of research and the chaotic structure of the beginning of the book.
084317420X|3.0|It's a good book for any child under the age of 10, as most Mr. Man books are. But it's not as cleverly written. It's difficult to review a children's book as such, but it doesn't have an interesting plot and it doesn't do much to hold ones attention as Mr. Happy, Mr. Bounce or Mr. Messy. It's okay, but I would have picked out another Mr. Man book instead had I known this.
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|First in a series of four titles this is a great science fiction movie with a good story line, you know end of the world but with a difference, with some great lines and graphics and of course Milla. If you love Milla get all four releases the story lines flow well from one to the other. There is a fifth title to be released on the big screen in 2012 I believe, so enjoy yourself.

1451648537|5.0|\\"to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.\\" -- Galatians 4:5 (NKJV)<br /><br />It's rare for a major biography based on lots of access to be published within weeks of a person's death. Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is such an exception, and I found it to be good at capturing a lot of details about Jobs's life to create a continuing narrative built around dramatic incidents in his life. If you had wondered about the psyche that could produce such amazing new product introductions and be so mean to people while working on the product, this book provides lots of surface evidence of someone who built his own reality, who wasn't comfortable with who he was, who wanted to impress, and who could be coldly manipulative. The roots of these characteristics are ascribed to having been given up for adoption by his biological parents. It's a pretty shallow explanation for someone who probably had some more serious personality disorders.<br /><br />Many of the reasons to want to read about Steve Jobs relate to interests in entrepreneurship, innovation, and product development in technology businesses. Although the book provides lots of information, it's more than a little light on insight concerning these subjects. A more specialized biography . . . or management book . . . will be required.<br /><br />The book will probably appeal most to those who love Apple products and Pixar movies, but don't know very much about Jobs's life . . . and are curious to know more. I think the book will satisfy most of such interests.<br /><br />A concern I have about the book is that Jobs was hardly a role model in many aspects of his life. While Mr. Isaacson doesn't pull any punches in some areas, such as Jobs's relationships with his children, the book isn't exactly objective when it comes to evaluating how he treated people at work. Inexcusable behavior is sort of justified by the results . . . in retrospect.  I couldn't help but wonder about people who Jobs abused and were harmed by the experience. People who treated others nicely are mostly portrayed as being deficient in smarts or interest in serving customers well.<br /><br />Intellect doesn't excuse inhumanity. The book doesn't quite deal with that issue.<br /><br />A lot of what Jobs did is also justified by the acme of success that Apple has achieved at the moment. From another point in time, many of the narratives here could have been written with a lot more objectivity. For instance, all the sturm und drang about the Macintosh in the book makes the launch seem more commercially important than it was. Mr. Isaacson mentions almost in passing that the Apple II was producing almost all of the revenues and profits for years to come.<br /><br />As a result, a lot of the long-term significance of this book is in providing interviews that future biographers may not be able to duplicate for themselves. As such, this book's lasting benefit may be to provide raw material for future biographers who will be able to apply more objectivity and expertise to describing such an unusual, gifted, and flawed individual whose career has affected a great many lives through the innovations he championed.<br /><br />Thank you for writing the book, Mr. Isaacson.

B005K17RU0|3.0|the app is user friendly and has a good look and feel.  however.... I am REALLY surprised that the percent chance of precipitation is not one of the metrics listed.  For me, this is hugely important, so that is why 3 stars.
