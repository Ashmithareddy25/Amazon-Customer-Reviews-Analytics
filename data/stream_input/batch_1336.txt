B000AYEL1A|5.0|I love this movie so much.  I have it in VHS and now needed to have it in DVD so I can watch it when we travel.
0345529057|4.0|...if you're looking for the books with the original covers and without any HBO signage and pictures, this is NOT for you. On the front cover of each individual book, there's a massive \\"new HBO show\\" thing. But if you don't mind, these books are absolutely fantastic and I definitely recommend them.

B0000033PB|4.0|Emerson Lake and Palmer are the red head stepchild of classic rock. They were one of the biggest acts of the seventies and could fill any stadium, but they get very little respect. They had what very few bands have: Balls and the industry made them pay for it. The best thing you can say about these guys is: You had to be there. I was at Rich Stadium in the summer of 74 and believe me: You had to see the show because it was a dynamo.  In 1992 they reunited for a new album and tour. The tour was excellent and I was sure glad to see the show. Black Moon was their new studio album and it was a pretty good effort. It was a bit mellower and about 10 years too late but no real ELP fan should be without it. I just bought a copy and was surprised at how well this has aged, it sounds better than ever. A nice remaster.  \\"Burning Bridges\\" is the only song on here that I would give less than 4 stars to and it is no worse than a lot of their numbers from the past. \\"Changing States\\" and \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" are two classic Keith Emerson instrumentals, they are both 5 star numbers. The title track and \\"Paper Moon\\" are the two best known songs on here and I have always liked them and would give both 4 stars. \\"Affairs of the Heart\\" is one Greg wrote with Geoff Downs of Asia and Yes, and it should have been a hit. \\"Close to Home\\" is a Keith piano solo and the song \\"Better Days\\" was written by producer Mark Mancina and it has a sound not normal for ELP, almost like Asia but it rocks. \\"Footprints In the Sand\\" is a typical Greg Lake acoustic number and the bonus track is another Keith piano solo.  There will never be another act like Emerson Lake and Palmer and those that were there for it will never forget. It's a hard thing to explain but in 1970 bands weren't doing songs like \\"Tank\\" and albums like \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" were the exception not the rule. I will always be an ELP fan and am glad to have this album back in my collection. 4 big stars for the most underrated rock band ever. They are in my rock and roll Hall of Fame.

B006Z20976|5.0|Yes, it's true, this is a movie produced by Christians with Christian messages and ideals in the movie. With that said, no matter how you look at it, this is a positive movie with good messages - and is one unique movie. To my knowledge, there just are no other movies out there like it with the main message it works so hard to portray. There is no comparison because there literally is nothing to compare it to (as far as I know anyway).  If you are not a Christian, I do definitely think you can still enjoy and get value from this movie, but it is true that you might be less likely to enjoy it then the Christian audience would - but this would largely depend on whether you would be deeply offended at hearing some Christian doctrine and teaching in a movie. Many non-Christians are. But some are more \\"tolerant\\" of such views. It would depend where you are on that spectrum.  At the end of the day, the core of this movie promotes fathers taking responsibility for themselves and their families and living honorably. I mean, that is pretty much the clear takeaway of the movie. To those that are not Christians that want to knock this movie for its clear Christian content and influences, I would ask them what part of this message is so horrible? Would they be more comfortable with a movie that shows and teaches fathers to be deadbeats (as plenty of other movies out there do?) Sadly the answer to that might be \\"yes\\". Some people will knock this movie for \\"preaching\\" (which it does!) but fail to realize that EVERY movie they have ever seen has preached SOMETHING to them - some more subtly perhaps, but there's always messages transmitted. And the vast majority of those movies haven't preached a message to them nearly as positive as this one! (unless you consider teaching you to curse - including cursing God - as much as you can, lust as much as you want, and generally behave as indecently as you can, \\"positive\\". I don't.)  Now to Christians I would say: This is a movie that EVERYChristian adult should see, especially fathers, though the themes are relevant for mothers as well. Created by the same church ministry that produced \\"Fireproof\\" (another excellent, unique movie that every Christian that is married or thinks they want to be someday should watch) and \\"Facing the Giants\\" (also worthwhile but see my amazon review on it for more info), this one takes it to a whole other level.  I echo a Focus On The Family reviewer when they said: \\"Courageous isn't so much a movie for the whole family as it is a movie for the benefit of the whole family. Discernment should be used in deciding how young is too young to watch drug dealers shooting at and fighting with policemen.\\" The movie is PG-13, and is probably appropriately rated. Although I know many have watched this movie with their children, I really am not sure it is that wise of an idea to actually watch it with your children, not just because of some of the violence (which isn't that bad all things considered), but because of the themes in the movie. The themes are good for adults to view and consider, but I don't see much benefit - and actually I can envision potential harm - for children (just my opinion).  This movie is well-paced: you will cry and you will laugh, but it is paced in such a way that it doesn't overwhelm you (i.e. after an intense dramatic scene, you get some light-heartedness). The acting is also pretty good (no, it's not \\"perfect\\") but it's perfectly fine and very believable - the emotional scenes in the movie I would think would be tough scenes to \\"get right\\" and it looks to me like they hit them perfectly!  No, the \\"movie quality\\" does not look like the latest Hollywood blockbuster (though it's not terribly far, either). But it also certainly doesn't look like a movie that was made with only a million dollars (which was its budget). Given the amount of movies out there with 200 million dollar budgets that are trash (I'm being kind) with all sorts of negative messages, this movie shows you don't need a lot of money to produce a really good, positive movie with life-changing impact!  My one \\"concern\\" (but it is just nitpicking): I admit when I watched this the first time in the theater that the music placement seemed more about trying to \\"show off\\" Christian music in the movie, then actually contributing to the story (unlike Fireproof).  However, since watching it again, I realize that wasn't justified.  For instance, I didn't realize on my first watch that the song the father danced to was the same one the girl danced to earlier in the movie.  And when they had that song playing (with him putting in the CD) right after a music montage with another contemporary Christian song, it just \\"hit me wrong\\".  In retrospect, now I can say that it really is an \\"important part of the movie\\" - but if I were doling out any advice for the future I might suggest they avoid 2 music songs literally back-to-back like that as it could give the wrong impression.  Indeed, I have seen reviews where non-Christians jumped on this, as well as the seeming promotion of other Christian products (including movie spin-off products).  One could easily argue that it was done to help deepen the impact/ministry impact of the movie, and I would probably even agree, but I'm just saying it seemed a bit obvious in a way that I'm not sure is all that helpful in the long run (but maybe it is, I don't know).  Blu-ray quality: Great. I own the Blu-ray and DVD. Compared to the DVD, the Blu-ray is noticeably sharper and clearer (as it should be) and colors were bright and natural (as they should be). It also was great to see several of the extras in HD as well.  I would recommend everyone watch this movie in Blu-ray - it is worth it!  By the way, I also recommend that everyone that likes this movie watch it with the commentary track turned on at least once - you will learn some interesting things and see how some scenes relate that you might not have caught.  Other thoughts: Iseriously wondered if, after the success of \\"Fireproof\\", the producers might be tempted - as many ministries are that start in the Spirit but then experience great success - to end up producing the next item more in the \\"flesh\\". I think I can hands-down say that this did NOT happen with \\"Courageous\\".  Beyond the obvious fruit of these movies that have come out of the Kendrick brothers and Sherwood Baptist Church, I just LOVE the backstory. I love the fact that the whole Sherwood Pictures thing came about as a desire to really reach people for God (i.e. the motivations seem to have been/be right!) and out of a willingness to think outside the box (i.e. not just trying to \\"copy\\" what others are doing!). It wasn't started to make money. It was/is a ministry! There's a MAJOR difference in that. And I believe God has clearly blessed and honored that. Here you've got a 3,000-member church in Georgia that has managed to majorly influence millions of people because they dared to believe they could with God's help (and with the right motives). Author Randy Alcorn, who wrote the novelization for \\"Courageous\\", said this:  \\"...the Sherwood story is distinctly different, in that it happened completely outside the mainstream. It wasn't birthed by a producer or a publisher, the way movies and books, whether secular or Christian, typically are. It began with the vision of a few church leaders who solicited the help of their local church, learning and improvising as they went. There's a great deal of creativity in local churches, lots of great songwriting and musical performances and even some quality drama. But it's often limited to songs sung by the choir, skits that illustrate sermon points, or localized Christmas and Easter pageants. People may come to these events from thirty miles away, but almost never do they break out of a community and achieve a regional status, much less a national or international one. Sherwood Pictures is in many ways unparalleled, a Cinderella story of staggering proportions. How could a church in Albany, Georgia have produced four films, counting Courageous, that have already had an amazing national and international impact, selling millions of DVDs and spinoff books? How could they have done so with mostly volunteer labor, at a fraction of the cost of conventional movie-making? Each movie has been better than its predecessor, and ten times better than what could be expected for the budget. But Courageous raises the bar to a whole new level. When many people see Courageous, they won't be thinking, 'Not bad, for a church' or 'Not bad considering it wasn't done by Hollywood.' A lot of people will just be thinking, 'Wow, this is a really good movie.'\\"  I would concur. And I believe that God is still looking for men and women that will, in honest sincerity, with right motivations, seek God's heart on how He might want to use them to impact our world.  I believe there's just as much a lesson for the Church in the backstory of Sherwood Pictures as in the actual movies they have produced. In fact, many of the themes that these movies portray kind of seem to mirror and are proved out by the reality of the backstory. For instance, it takes a lot of COURAGE and integrity to do what they have done - they've certainly had to be \\"Courageous\\" themselves. In \\"Facing the Giants\\", the main message was that when you follow Christ, nothing is impossible - that there is nothing impossible with God - and with faith in God (and living an \\"excellent\\" life - i.e. the \\"works\\" part of the \\"faith without works is dead\\" thing) and desiring for God to get the glory, that God is able to do beyond what we could even imagine. They've certainly proven that out!  I for one get excited when I see good Christian movies (or Christian-themed movies such as the Narnia series) because that is one area that non-Christians have had a monopoly on for far too long. It's refreshing to see what the medium can really accomplish when it is God-ordained and used for/to promote good, rather than demonically-ordained and used for/to promote evil.  Courageous showcases this perfectly!  Chris Long  Laugh & Lift ministries

B00667KMUO|1.0|Around the time that games started making more money than films, movies began to look an awful lot like games and the last few Harry Potter films are no exception. Every scene has the same texture, dim lighting, awkward and indecipherable action sequences created by people who have likely spent far too much time indoors to know how things actually look and move.  Not to be outdone, David Yates method directs like a binging Death Eater and drains any remaining signs of life from this once charming series. The main characters all but collapse under the weight of their faux grim and gritty makeovers. Cringe-worthy lines like, \\"Not my daughter you b***h!\\" pretty much ensure that this film will only be timeless as an object of ridicule, much like an avocado-colored refrigerator is today.
1594202842|3.0|wow is about I can say after I read this. Being that my husband is Chinese, I've heard a lot about Chinese parenting over the years. This is really not so much about her parenting techniques, but her obsession with music lessons and having her girls becomes prodigies. It made me exhausted just to read it. Sorry, Amy, but I think you need to spend some time in a psychiatrist's chair and examine your motives for doing what you did. She may say she \\"changed\\" but really I don't think you did. She went to battle with Lulu and Lulu in a sense won. That's not changing. If Amy had won, she'd still be the same old parent.<br /><br />However, I'd still recommend the book. It starts out as an easy read, but in the middle it gets a little monotonous with all her details about music. For readers not into classical music, it'll get boring. Picks up toward the end so bear with the chapters filled with too much music detail. In the end you'll feel better after reading this sad tale of a dictatorial mom.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In a nutshell, this story was amazing! It kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I don't even remember a \\"slow\\" part in the book. I couldn't, nor did I want to put it down. I will say that just from reading the \\"details\\" about what the book is about.....that's not what it's really about. It's not that cut and dry at least. I'll just say this....it's not what you think....it's better.
1455121924|5.0|This is a great book/audio. It really helps you to understand where is your responsibility in getting where you are today in regards to your health/weight, that means that it will help you take back the control over your body.  You will be amazed by the change it will bring into your life, and not only loosing weight.  At the beginning I felt anger but as I kept reading I realized where I fell short about my health and by increasing my awareness I started to actually feet that there's hope again, being on gluten-free for a while now , I feel I have reconnected to my body, I feel I honor my body rather then abusing it (eating gluten unfortunately is an abuse to every body), I felt like a kid again being friendly with my body.  I'm happier too, I know that's weird, but I had those unexplained moods where I had no idea where it came from that are gone now.  I can go on and on and on with how important it is for you to know what you really eat which is different from what you think you eat. If you are looking at the reviews it means you already aware enough that something isn't quite right and something needs to be done, don't hesitate you won't regret that :)
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I bought these with the advice from friends that I wouldn't be disappointed. They were very right. I bought them about a month ago, and since that time my TV's volume hasn't been turned up... at all. Whether I'm watching Netflix or gaming my heart out on Battlefield 3, the quality is crazy, sound is amazing, deep lows crisp highs through and through. Chat boost is awesome. When I can hear the enemy running around the corner towards me on my RIGHT side, and I know that for a fact, you get the jump. Very nice, every things awesome.

B00702MUYA|5.0|It is a new year, but has anyone noticed that the CD version of this album sells for $8.99 (on Amazon) and the MP3 digital version sells for $10.99?  And this is not a double CD or deluxe edition that has extra cuts.  The typical MP3 price for new albums on Amazon has been $7.99 and I find a red  flag has gone up with this substantial price increase for digital versions of albums.  Why the ultra high price?  Great music or not, this is very distressing to me.
B005QJZ5FA|3.0|Forgive her privileged background - Lana Del Rey shows on \\"Born to Die\\" she is not merely a looker with a minimal musical talent. The album is ambitious, pensive and proof of hard work. It overflows with youthful energy and desire to craft meaningful tunes, of which there are several.<br /><br />The problem is that, despite the long list of producers christening the album's sound, most of the songs are arranged, adorned and, also, composed, similarly. Most of them sound like lead single \\"Video Games\\" - not a terrible thing for those who adore the melancholic, attention-grabbing tune, but not a positive for those looking for variety or proof that Del Rey has more than one trick up her designer sleeve.<br /><br />Her deliberately restrained, downbeat delivery colors all the tunes, which more or less all fade in and out of each other without differentiation. The sound is impressive, but wears thin by the album's midway point. Her cooing way with a phrase, which initially sounds intriguing, reveals itself to be an affectation.<br /><br />The title track is one of the more interesting tunes, with her vocals a shade huskier and incisive, piercing lyrics. \\"Summertime Sadness\\" also takes an interesting idea and runs with it semi-successfully.<br /><br />Lana Del Rey has a talent, and \\"Born to Die\\" proves this, but it is a sign post of musicianship in its larva stage, yet to reach full-flower.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I need a task app that displays my various lists on the front page. And on each list, I can type in my list item with a visible note attached. Tasks n Todos Pro fit the bill perfectly.  This app was exactly what I need -- crisp and clean. Amazingly, some of the other to do apps I tried did NOT have this simple functionality. In particular, they did not display your lists on a summary page and instead required you to filter your 'to dos' based on an assigned catagory each time you wanted to see a different list. As you can imagine, this is extremely time consuming if you are a list freak like I am.  Anyway, this app also has all the bells and whistles one would expect from a to do app, like reminders, priority, etc.  Excellent app.

B000FVQLRA|4.0|How much shame? No more than we deserve, all of us. How much guilt? Not yet quite enough, I fear. Obviously we crave more grief in atonement for the atrocities of the foulest century of our history, since we eat up films and novels that depict it. Do you, esteemed reader, feel guilt and shame at the genocides perpetrated by your species against each other? If not, you're unworthy of something we call humanity.<br /><br />W'adys'aw Szpilman, the \\"pianist\\" of the film, was not a hero. He was a survivor. Perhaps that's the best any of us can claim, to be survivors. But then, there's the phenomenon known as \\"survivor's guilt.\\" I've known several Holocaust survivors; in fact, I'm related to some by marriage. Some express guilt, some express gratitude, but I've never heard one boast of survival. In any case, Szpilman was a real person, whose post-war memoir attracted little notice until decades after the events it described. The first film based on it, made in Poland in 1949, was suppressed by the Communists. Szpilman's son republished the memoir in 1998, first in German and then in English. Szpilman died in Warsaw in July, 2000 at the age of 88, two years before the release of this film directed by Roman Polanski.<br /><br />The first three-quarters of this film are agonizing. Horrible. Plausible. My wife couldn't handle it. She went off to bed to read a new \\"Parker\\" novel for relief. The acting, to be honest, isn't brilliant, but the cinematic portrayal of the brutality of the Nazis in Warsaw obviated any need for character development. Then came the escape. The survival despite all odds. Battle scenes, flight across roofs, the wry humor of near starvation assuaged by a can of pickles. And at last, One Just Man, one German capable of pity. That German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, really did appear in the memoir; his identity was later confirmed, and it's known that he died in a Soviet gulag. I suppose the end of the film is intended as a statement of comfort and optimism, possibly as a signal of reconciliation. From the moment Szpilman is discovered in hiding by Hosenfeld, music swells in the film. Hosenfeld orders Szpilman to play the piano, and director Polanski gives us quite a long concert view of the Pianist's hands on the keyboard. The Russians arrive, the war is over in a few quick edits, and Szpilman is at the keyboard again in a rebuilt radio studio. The end of the film shows Szpilman performing a concerto with a full orchestra. He survives. Music survives. Human decency survives. That's the message I think the film delivers, but I'm not persuaded. Not even music can redeem us. That's a powerful statement of grief and guilt, coming from me, a person who lives for music.of reconciliation.

B0067LY4WG|5.0|Should \\"Old Ideas\\" turn out to represent the 77 year old Canadians last album (which we must pray it doesn't) then it is clear that Leonard Cohen has truly saved some of the best until last. It is his first new album of material since 2004's \\"Dear Heather\\" and displays all the Cohen characteristics that have made him as essential to music as water is to the human condition. In these ten songs we find perennial themes of love, regret, reflection, bitterness, hope and most of all an unsentimental template, which expounds in Cohen's words \\"a manual for living with defeat\\". It was ever thus and over a great career where the Guardian recently described him as a \\"sombre prophet, mordant wisecracker, and repentant cad\\" he has brought his own special brand of musical melancholy and deadpan nobility that demands the epithet of \\"true original\\".<br /><br />\\"Old Ideas\\" is an album free from the jauntiness of a \\"Closing Time\\" or the pounding electronica of \\"First we take Manhattan\\". If there is a previous reference point then perhaps \\"Bird on the wire\\" comes closest. The songs unfold with no sense of urgency and are often slothful, ponderous but utterly brilliant. The album kicks off in splendid style with \\"Going home\\" where Cohen has a conversation with his artistic self and announces \\"I love to speak with Leonard/He's a sportsman and a shepherd/He's a lazy b.../Living in a suit\\". Throughout the Webb Sisters add the usual heavenly backing vocals and the song gently concludes with Cohen's reprise of the lines above. The second song \\"Amen\\" could have happily graced a Tom Waits album while the brilliant longing piano ballad \\"Show me the place\\" with its laconic shuffle is a stellar highlight. The blues of \\"Darkness\\" strikes this reviewer as matching the mortality preoccupations of Dylan's \\"Time out of mind\\" as Cohen announces \\"I know my days are few ... I thought the past would have lasted me, but the darkness got that too.\\" As usual Cohen's lyrics present a masterclass no more on the paean of self regret that is \\"Anyhow\\" which sounds like Dr John with a hangover. Other highlights include the wonderful tight strung guitar ballad \\"Crazy to love you\\" which you instinctively feel could have been brilliantly covered by the late Johnny Cash. It is surely one of Cohen's best songs? Alternatively \\"Come healing\\" with its sweet Webb Sisters introduction sounds hymn like as Cohen exhorts us to \\"Behold the gates of mercy/In arbitrary space/And none of us deserving/The cruelty or the grace\\". Of the final three songs \\"Banjo\\" is almost funky and Cohen's repeated lines in that tell tale droll voice are a joy. The delightful \\"Lullaby\\" has flashes of a lonely harmonica and meanders beautiful leading one critic to argue \\"its passion is impeccably restrained\\". Finally the whole kit and kaboodle is rounded off by the organ blues and spent passion of \\"Different sides\\" where Cohen languidly regrets that \\"Both of us say there are laws to obey/Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone/You want to change the way I make love/ But I want to leave it alone\\". Great stuff.<br /><br />The tempo throughout \\"Old ideas\\" is stately and restrained. Cohen plies his trade as a wordsmith with consummate skill and that old voice with its deep tones resonates down the years. In \\"Old Ideas\\" Cohen has spent time carefully crafting a set of songs that are his best in years. It does have a valedictory tone and who knows if there is more to come. That said if the old goat ceases forthwith to weave his magic this album is a fine testament to a body of work which it utterly unique. Thus as Cohen's lifelong friend Jennifer Warnes has rightly observed he retains a very firm hold on \\"The place where God and love and literature meet\\".

I bought it this morning and have been listening to it non-stop all day. He has always talked to both the darkness and light in my soul and this album especially reaches out.  \\"Darkness\\" is just about another \\"Hallelujah,\\" and I didn't think that was possible.  Each play adds layers and impact.  Get it, get it, get it!

B002NPHQCK|5.0|NORTH BY NORTHWEST is by far my favorite Hitchcock thriller. It's a genuine nail biter throughout, with several excellent action sequences, a wonderful cast, superb story and a climax that remains 50 years later one of the greatest of all time! This film belongs in all home video libraries.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for CIA agent George Kaplan by a gang of spies headed by the evil Phillip Vandamm (Mason).

B00009NQQO|3.0|I was very excited to get this for my daughter as she has outgrown her baby bath toys.  When we got it, I was a little dissapointed as the suction cups would not stick to our wall tile.  The tile in our bathroom does not have a slick/shinny finish so we ended up sticking to the side of the bathtub.  My daughter does like to play with it but would be more fun to be higher in the bath area.
B005HP2J66|5.0|This is one of the most important films you will ever see.  In a plainly told story, we are transported into the present through the eyes of humans long since dead (30,000 years).  But the most haunting aspect is that the communication with these people is only one-directional.  \\"...are we today, possibly, the crocodiles looking back into the abyss of time when we see the paintings of Chauvet Cave?\\"  Just watch this.  Do it.  Do it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun, good part time and makes you think. Its cool how you can have a lot of games in one game.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|As a fan of the book series, I was looking forward to see what the HBO television show had to offer.  The idea of a premium cable series based off the books was promising; it could have all the sex, violence and political intrigue of the novels without having to censor or dumb it down for network audiences.  From that angle, it succeeded.  At the same time, I feel that it failed to really capture the spirit of the books.  While it is a professional product, I feel that the creators were more interested in the human drama than the underlining mythic current that was noticeable even in the first book.  Yes, a Song of Ice and Fire is not the traditional fantasy of a noble here going on a quest to slay the dark lord but at the same time it also isn't a political thriller set in the middle ages; the series is a saga that plays itself out on many levels, both the personal and the impersonal.  While further seasons may change this (when the more fantastic elements become impossible to avoid), so far the series seems to focus more on the mundane than the fantastic.  If that was the only flaw the series had I might be able to ignore it, but worse yet is the portrayal of some of the characters.  While Peter Dinklage played a fantastic Tyrion,  Maisie Williams was a dull Ayra Stark and Lena Heady plays a likable (as opposed to villainous) Queen Cersei - flaws I attribute more to the writing than the actresses.  All in all, it isn't a bad series - but it isn't fantastic either.  I hope season two will be better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is so much fun. It has soo many games to chose from. Best app ever! I recommend it to everyone

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I had high hopes for this adaptation, and for the most part, I enjoyed it. Fassbender was fantastic, although a bit too handsome and slender in build. Rochester is meant to be althletic, broad shouldered, and harsh looking. But those are minor complaints. Overall, I thought Mr. Fassbender embodied the character very well.  I thought Mia W. had the right look for Jane, but her performance was a bit boring to me. I know that Jane is meant to be plain and quiet, but I just didn't sense her inner strength, and in the first proposal scene, she seemed more annoyed than passionate.  Lastly, I HATED the ending. No Ferndean? No bringing of a tray, and the touching of hands? And what was with that crazy beard that Rochester was sporting? Worst of all, they just ended it with a kiss, and then, fade to black. Couldn't they have added ten more minutes and put the second proposal in? If it wasn't for such a chopped off ending, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

B006T5FDLG|5.0|Like the other reviewers............ Why were even any of these left of the Death Magnetic Album. They are all awesome songs.  Being a fan of even the more extreme metal I cetainly appreciate Metallica playing good old fashioned Metal.  Not as Extreme as the later New Bands but hell they are still up there.  I just hope Metallica can follow up with just one more super Effort.  I would like to see a few classic Justice type songs with some Black type songs and Master of Puppets sogns  - hell why dont they try some extreme metal Colaborations like Slipknot and Soulfly - get a guest appearance such as Max Cavalera.... or Black Sabbath ......  Zak Wilde..... Lets make the next Metallica a really Kill Em Again album !<br /><br />Can't wait to see if they can Maintain the Momentum on anything from this Great Realease where all songs are fantastic.
0345505387|3.0|I had no delusions regarding the limitations of the graphic novel when I purchased \\"The Exile.\\"  I expected it to rehash the original story, and was pleased that it stayed true to the details of \\"Outlander.\\"  The new perspectives of Murtagh and Jamie were, in my opinion, fine as well.  I liked learning that Murtagh saw Claire coming from the rocks and seeing Jamie fight behind the scenes for Claire to have a decent wedding.  My only problem with the book was the art.  I read a bunch of reviews which commented about how beautiful the artwork is.  Now I'm not saying it isn't beautiful, but I'm deeply troubled by the lack of consistency in the depiction of Jamie and Claire.  I think Murtagh and Dougal were pretty consistent and rather spot-on in matching my inner minds picture, and I even think that the \\"official\\" drawings of Jamie and Claire are quite good (as shown in the back of the book).  Obviously they are not going to match each reader's imagination, but they were nice depictions none-the-less.  However, the quality of the drawings quickly seems to disintegrate into ridiculous-looking caricatures.  Jamie looks goofy and Claire looks like Betty Boop (as others have commented).  I have other graphic novels which seem to be able to portray their characters consistently throughout (e.g. the \\"Twilight\\" graphic novels), so I'm left wondering why there is such disparity with these.  I'm disappointed.  I think if Claire saw some of those pictures of herself she would take...Roosevelt's..name in vain!

B0071NLG0W|5.0|I loved this book! All the Amber Fox mysteries have been brilliant but this one is the best so far; I couldn't put it down. The character dynamics are fabulous, the mystery is brilliant, the story line is excellent, all wrapped up in one ball of humour. If you like the Janet Evanovich series you will love this as Amber Fox is an intelligent Stephanie Plum. I can't recommend this book highly enough.

B005K17RU0|4.0|The upside; As a professional driver, I find it VERY usefull in keeping track of changing weather conditions as I travel.  The live radar is usually current to the half hour or better, and the capability to scroll in all directions lets me check over my entire route. The downside; The app often has difficulty locating itself, evev with all location services on.  I don`t know what it uses to determine location, but it doesn`t seem to use satelite at all.  Also, from a control freak perspective, I do not like that the launches automaticly, and there is no option in settings to make it stop doing so.  That`s why only 4 stars.  I will continue to use, but I prefer to control my own device, thank you.

1595141715|3.0|Suicide is bad. Being vindictive isn't too swell either.<br /><br />As with Jay Asher's amiable sophomore project, The Future of Us, Thirteen Reasons Why was wrapped around a great concept which proceeded to get misplaced in a thin storyline until ultimately the tale did not live up to the idea which gave it birth. The subject matter here is serious (is it mean-spirited if I say it almost seemed as if the tone of the novel perpetually spelled that notion out in caps HEY, THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE, PEOPLE!) and the underlying idea of youthful death is so powerful it does much to carry the book's many weaknesses. Being a teenaged girl is never easy but most of us survive it, unlike Asher's main character here, a girl whose suicide probably saved the men she would have gone on to meet in her 20s a hell of a lot of relationship-oriented misery.<br /><br />Verily, I can only hope this book's imaginative writer intended for Hannah to be this manipulative narcissistic drama queen, because that's how she came across. She was a bitter egoist who tried to ruin lives even after her own death. Her self-pitying me-isms made me think she deserved a good solid betchslapping and convent school more than a sympathetic audience. Even her post mortem monologue is purchased with the threat of blackmail. (I'm dead and still so important!!!!)<br /><br />None of this is a criticism of the book itself, since many books contain unlikable characters, and the concept here was so marvelous I knew as soon as I heard about it that I had to read Thirteen Reasons, just....the finished work was not quite up to the lofty heights of the ideas that gave it birth. I was impressed with the details, unimpressed with most of the book itself, but I don't regret reading Thirteen Reasons Why, I just wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who had limited free time and many unopened books sitting on a shelf.<br /><br />PS Added 2-3-12: You know, on later reflection this seems like one of those books whose greatest impact comes about with time. Already I'm thinking about reading it again as it's stayed in my thoughts these last days. Maybe the best word for this story is \\"haunting\\".<br /><br />PPS 2-10-12: Nah, I was right the first time. Forgettable.ady I'm thinking about reading it again as it's stayed in my thoughts these last days. Maybe the best word for this story is \\"haunting\\".  PPS 2-10-12: Nah, I was right the first time.

1451627289|4.0|While grading essays from his adult English class, high school teacher Jake Epping is touched by one student's account of the horrific events that destroyed his childhood family.  Sometime later Jake discovers that his acquaintance Al, famous for the \\"fatburgers\\" he serves at the local diner, has discovered a \\"rabbit hole\\" into the past.  Jake steps through it into Lisbon Falls, Maine at 11:58 PM on September 9, 1958.  Each trip to the past begins at this same time and place.  And, no matter how long he remains in the past, Jake always steps back into the future two minutes after he left it.<br /><br />Al has figured out these rules, but not much else about this local and limited form of time travel.  He has been using it mostly to buy low-cost hamburger for his fatburgers.  Jake decides to improve the present by cleaning up a few messes in the past.  He begins with his former student, stopping a drunk and murderous father before he can kill most of his family with a hammer.  After Jake averts a few more tragedies, Al talks him into a grander scheme.  Jake will return to 1958, live there until the early sixties, and somehow prevent President John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963.<br /><br />Armed with extensive notes on Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, and five years of \\"future\\" sports outcomes that 1958 bookies don't yet know about, Jake steps back into history.  Undocumented aspects of the past leave room for a few surprises.  And the ripples of change spread as Jake affects--and is affected by--unfolding events.  Jake's mission is further complicated by the non-cumulative aspect of his changes.  Each time he travels back to 1958 causes a \\"reset\\" with all of the effects of previous trips undone.  This gives a [[ASIN:B000SP1SH6 Groundhog Day]] quality to Jake's several false starts early in the story.  This quality fades as Jake finally settles in for his long walk to 1963.<br /><br />Stephen King does a great job with this book.  There are times that it drags a little, but this doesn't detract too much from a good story.  King fans will enjoy cameos from a few familiar people and places.  But no special knowledge of other stories or King's behind-the-scenes mechanics of reality is necessary to understand or enjoy the narrative.  And he gets the people and their emotions right.  An unsupportable claim, perhaps, since I don't really \\"know\\" them outside of his writing.  But I feel like I do.  Their lives matter, even though I could turn back to the first page and begin them again.<br /><br />So read and enjoy it.  And decide whether to reread it.'t detract too much from a good story.

145162445X|4.0|\\"Why is there something, and not nothing?\\" That's been a question for millennia and theologians have usually taken our inability to give an answer as an opportunity to shove their god in to fill the gap. But like so many other gaps, this one is slowly being filled.  Here, Krauss shares with us not only his love for the physics and the quest for deep and true understanding, but his derision for those who would sell us easy answers given out of ignorance. The book has plenty of jabs at unthinking theologians which are certainly fun to read, but rather than venting his spleen, he uses it as an opportunity to explore deeper questions about what are the source of knowledge, how we learn, and even what answers should look like. Krauss takes us on a journey that stretches fourteen billion years into the past, a trillion years into the future, and, like wow man, into our minds. In so doing, he skims over some of the new ideas (and more importantly, the new evidence) in physics and shows why something from nothing isn't merely a possibility, but why it might be a certainty.  If you liked his writing, I would recommend delving deeper into these topics with books from Sean Carroll, who skips the jabs for much more complex discussions of time, entropy and meaning. But for an educated layperson, Krauss offers a very good intro.

030746363X|4.0|In The 4-Hour Body author Timothy Ferriss, who is a certified trainer and fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine, meticulously guides you through his methods toward rapid fat loss, increased muscles, faster healing, strength gain, better sleep, improved sex and more! Having documented his every workout for more than 15 years, Ferriss writes on what works and what doesn't.  This book isn't one that requires cover-to-cover reading, but should be read based on your needs and wants. The basics on fat loss are easily followed but unlike some other books on weight loss, Ferris explains the reasons why his methods work in easy-to-understand words for the majority and more scientific explanations, off-set in shaded areas, for those who need more technicality.  It's all interesting and really does work! The chapter on improving sex will give you the knowledge you need to please or be pleased! This is a book to be highlighted and dog-eared in your favorite spots to refer back to and to definitely share with others!  It has no age limit as everyone should be able to benefit from part of its contents.(Previously reviewed for San Francisco and Sacramento Book Review.)

B004UHPU5E|4.0|It's been awhile now since the last full-fledged King Crimson album, and yet guitarist Robert Fripp seems to be showing little interest in revving up the band again. As a longtime KC fan, this doesn't bother me in the slightest. Fripp, and hence Crimson, does things in his own time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we fans could do far worse than having \\"Scarcity of Miracles\\" to hear. No, this release does not roar out of the speakers a la \\"Thrak\\" or \\"Red,\\" but it's fascinating in its own right. I especially have been enjoying Mel Collins' saxophone playing on it, and the rhythm section of Gavin Harrison and Tony Levin, who sound exceptionally supple on this outing.<br /><br />\\"Scarcity\\" also benefits from the 5.1 mix available on the DVD-Audio included. Wonderfully open sound here, with instruments spaced around the room, but the mix is also subtle enough to command respect; there's nothing artificial about it.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a good, solid album by a group of musicians whose next move may (or may not) be a full Crimson onslaught. With these guys, you never know what they'll do next, and for me, that's part of the fun.

B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I have used this Kindle Fire cover for two months. It is perfect in many ways but poor in others:  1. the worst feature is that the plastic back cover is itself covered with some kind of material to make it feel and look good. However this material is wearing off so rapidly it is ridiculous. It is worse than if it were just the underlying shiny plastic because it looks like it has been used for years - ragged and ugly.  2. although it has held up fine functionally so far I do not have great confidence that the elastic strap and the front flap will not start coming apart very prematurely.  I will contact them for a replacement. It is not what it should be.

I did not even enjoy Shutter Island all that much and this was many many notches below that. This concept of a character who does not know who he is has been done enough. Please stop making this film unless it is with a very new unique twist. This film tries to twist it up but it's absurd when it all comes out. I figured it out way before the film explained itself.  Thank god I only rented this. There are better films than this out there. Go rent some of them.

B004LV32JU|4.0|It's kind of hard to level any kind of criticism toward a band that can play circles around you or the competition, and Sylosis are definitely at the top of their game as far as modern thrash is concerned.<br />  \\"The Edge Of The World\\" is an ambitious slugfest of an album.  The guitars move along at the speed of light, and stay on the side of thrash without venturing into Dragonforce territory, where a band like this could end up, and that would not be good.  Josh Middleton is a fine guitarist indeed and for the genre a powerful vocalist.  The band flirts ever so slightly with some more prog oriented outfits, Dream Theater comes to mind, but stays solidly within the thrash boundaries, unlike Revocation, where that band delightfully hops all over the place, especially in mid-song breaks.<br />  And that is where the problem, if any, lies.  Sylosis are fine representatives of modern thrash, and the acoustic interludes and occasional keyboards add the necessary color to the manic guitars.  What would make a good album better to me would be a bit of a groove here and there just to mess with the tempos a bit.  But that's a personal thing, not a criticism.  \\"The Edge Of The World\\" is a lengthy CD and requires repeated listenings before it starts to grow on you, but that too is usually the sign of an album that won't get dull any time soon.  Fans of Megadeth and other more complex thrash outfits will be happy with this album.

1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is one strange debut, I have read it twice already and I still can't get over odd it is. When I say odd, I mean the good kind of odd because who wants to be normal? I have never read a book like Miss Peregrine's before and I doubt any other book could be as wonderfully creepy and bizarre. When I first read Miss Peregrine's, I instantly fell in love with this peculiar novel and the 2nd time around, I think I enjoyed it even more. It's no surprise to me that millions have people have already fallen in love with this novel.<br /><br />  Everything about Miss Peregrine's is extraordinary and it is a book that truly defies genres. I'm not even sure which genre to categorize this book as, is it fantasy? Paranormal? Sci-Fi? Historical Fiction? Seriously this book is so unique that it doesn't really conform with the normal boundaries of literary genres. What I do know is that Miss Peregrine's is that it's an extremely well-written, structured novel.<br /><br />  Jacob has always heard stories from his grandfather that are extraordinary and peculiar. He has seen photos of bizarre children floating and doing all sorts of crazy things. The thing is that Jacob used to believe in his stories but now he doesn't really believe these tales. Jacob thinks that the stories are fairy-tales his grandpa made up. Jacob goes to the island to discover if the children are myth or if they actually existed. Could the island be dangerous? What Jacob finds is beyond belief and will shock readers to the core!<br /><br />  There's a little bit of Jacob in all of us. When we were younger we believed in things like fairies, magic, and witches. As we got older, we slowly discarded these ideas as fiction and just ridiculous. I think deep down we all want to believe that magic and other products of fairy tales are true but we just don't know what to believe. Jacob struggles with reality vs. the fictional world and it's a struggle we all have dealt with at one point or another. Jacob is a character that we can definitely all relate to with his immense curiosity and fascination with the paranormal.<br /><br />  The plot of Miss Peregrine's is truly brilliant and Ransom Riggs knows how to craft an incredible story. I don't want to give anything away but you will be amazed and astounded by the creativity that flows in this novel. Even though I had read this once before, I couldn't help but feel this need to keep reading. I knew basically what was going to happen, yet Miss Peregrine's was so engrossing that I couldn't even fathom putting it aside. A great book is one you can re-read and it will never get old. I can definitely imagine picking up this book for a 3rd time right before I read the sequel and I know I will still love this story.<br /><br />  The way Riggs incorporated original photographs into this book was truly genius. I love the uncanny nature of the photos and the vintage feel of them. These photos are just one of the countless reasons that make Miss Peregrine's a must-read. Seriously, pick up the paperback or hardcover of this book if you want the full magical experience of this book. I wouldn't recommend listening to the audiobook because then you'll be missing out on these photos and the brilliant way they are intertwined with the text.<br /><br />  There is truly nothing like reading Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children! Reading this book is a one-of-a-kind rare literary experience that is unparalleled. Ransom Riggs has written a page-turner that is filled with all-sorts of wonderful surprises. I highly, highly recommend reading this novel and I am confident that this novel can turn reluctant readers into avid readers. It's no surprise that Tim Burton is set to direct an adaptation of this book and I'm dying to see Jacob's adventures on the big screen. I'm confident that this will make a highly entertaining movie and I can't wait to see it when it comes out in 2014. Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children remains one of my all-time favorite books and words can't describe how much I LOVE this book! I'm super excited to read the sequel, Hollow City & January can't come fast enough! Thank you to Quirk for providing me with a finished copy of this book in exchange for a honest review.r Children remains one of my all-time favorite books and words can't describe how much I LOVE this book!

0671449028|4.0|our daughter (17 months old) got this for Christmas (now Jan 31) and she loves this book. while reading it to her i sort of sing it more then read it to hold her interest and i act it out a little bit, or point to things in the story to hold her attention. She brings it to me over and over again every day. i make it fun for her :) at first it was only a sleepy time book but now its one of the first she brings me.<br /><br />like most of her board books she's chewed the edges up. the damages are visible but it hasn't started coming apart yet :) and she does that to all of her board books. her books vary in damages based on how long she has had them so i would say it compares to them as being an equal in durability. we've tried many teething toys, the binding on her books is still preferred though, lol. i think its fairly normal but due to that i don't expect the book to last long term. it is a great book that if she destroys it we will replace it for her.<br /><br />my fav. part is the end where they rock, and rock, and rock to sleep because our little girl will rock with me and i love that :)

B001YV504U|5.0|There are great feel good movies and, among baseball films, this is the One.  A few films leave you with a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye.  This is one.  For me this is very a very touching film.  My own father passed away recently at the age of 90.  I wish I had told him before he died just much it meant to me as a kid and a teenager to play catch with him in the backyard, field grounders and pop ups.  So this movie has a meaning to me it didn't years ago.  It is a wonderful film.  A place where the greats can come back and play the game again.  If you build it, he will come. It isn't until the end that you -- and Ray Kinsella -- realize exactly what that truly means.  A film of redemption.  A story of it.  Long after all of us are gone -- as long as there are people love the game -- this film will still resonate.  More than PRIDE OF THE YANKEES or MAJOR LEAGUE, this is truly the one.  Share it with your children.  I wish I could. On Blu Ray it looks and sounds great.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|wow was I wrong.  this app is great.  I mean how you can control ur computer from a different room in ur house.  I freaked out my sister.  I told her to look at the screen.  then I started typing words into Microsoft word with my kindle and she was so scared.  but its not like you need to pay $5 for this app.  I got it for free.  if u don't have it its not like the world is going to end.  (ITS COOL BUT ITS NOT LIKE ITS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!) remember those words like the Alamo.
0307959856|5.0|P.D. James added to our appetite for insight into the married life of Darcy and Elizabeth.  Familiar characters and the language of a enchanting era grace the pages of this mystery engulfing life at Pemberly.  Remember, this story takes place in Jane Austin's England.  You must expect P.D. James to hold true to the intrigue, scandal, and culture that would befit the rank and world of our beloved Elizabeth, Darcy, Jane, Bingley, and their dubious relatives Lydia and Wickham.  This Austin fan was at no loss for entertainment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this cloud based app. No matter what device I am reading on, I can synchronize and pick up where I left off.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|I one day decided to marathon a few of his works and TG happened to be one of them. I immediately purchased a copy as soon as I could because I knew this was one film I could watch over and over again without getting sick of it. It is just beautiful. BEAUTIFUL. I'm going to purchase Millennium Actress, Paprika, and Perfect Blue now.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|I personally own seven different issues of Kind of Blue in both LP and CD formats and this (2011 Columbia/Legacy LP) is perhaps the best sounding of all! This issue was remastered by Kevin Gray at Cohearant Audio (formerly with AcousTech Mastering) and is absolutely awesome!! Besides having near perfect tonal balance and drop dead sonics, the RTI (Record Technology, Inc.) pressed, 180 gram, premium, virgin vinyl is dead quiet. All this for some twenty bucks! If you like this album and don't own a turntable, buy it anyway, then buy a turntable. If you already own a turntable, do like I did and buy extra copies as gifts for your audiophile friends - they'll love you for it. This release may the definitive issue of the \\"best selling jazz album of all time,\\" in my opinion. You definitely WON'T be sorry!! Get one (or more) before they're gone!
B001PL4HZW|3.0|I bought this CD, because I wanted the song that is playing when Edward sucks the venom out of Bella's arm.  It's called \\"let me sign\\" and Rob Pattinson sings it.  It's NOT on the CD.  What a dissapointment!!

B0042U94UQ|3.0|I liked the final outcome and the message it delivered but most of the video consisted of scary and hurtful scenes. The protagonist and some of the characters are very mean. The children have to endure a lot of fright and rejection before they are finally victorious. I won't let my grandson see it.

B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie moved me because it was a true story of compassion.  I was a foster parent for many years and we ended up adopting 4 children.  It's not easy nurturing someone else's child (children).  More power goes out to that family!  They are truly an inspiration!
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. What a genius but man what a difficult man. He created a great company and you cant take that away.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|All of Clints movies are classics as far as I am concerned. This is just as good as the others if not better. Pale Rider He is definitely. I especially liked the axe handle scenes where he teaches some bad guys how to use them LOL. Great movie. I highly recommend it.
0143120255|5.0|Anyone who has ever visited or lived in one of these two magical cities will be riveted by the beautiful graphic designs in this book as well as amused by the side by side comparisons, often wonderfully ironic. Vahram Muratyan has distilled the essence of both cities with love and a critical eye for each of them. The book is a terrific conversation piece and a great gift for anyone who loves to travel, either physically or just in the mind.
0743289692|5.0|I was so pleased I discovered this book.  As a human rights supporter, I was so relieved to finally hear a strong voice of a woman who experienced countless abuses of her human rights, lost her sister to mental illness, witnessed her mother's endless suffering, survived clan wars, saw her father fight for freedom in his country, experienced the collapse of her family, and many other situations of human hardship.  This is a very important piece of literature on many levels.  First it is an incredible autobiography to read - one can simply not put it down and it is superbly written.  Secondly, it is evidence of how a woman can suffer and more importnantly survive physical abuse and mental abuse on the basis of archaic cultural traditions.  How this woman has survived is beyond logic.  Cast into a world of her own to escape misery and lack of free will - she progressed through hard work and self determination to create a new life for herself.  Thirdly it sensitively describes the road from indoctrination to free thought and instilling an internal moral code of ethics, which many of us go through on varying levels as we develop.  This is also an important work for women who feel trapped in a situation in which they are miserable and/or suffer abuse.  It shows that one can change a situation even in the most awful/painful circumstances.  This book is a triumph for human rights.  The voices of victims are rarely heard.  n.b. I was very careful not to judge the whole of the Islam faith on this book and remained neutral.

B005OTGS4E|2.0|Low budget WW2 movie, nothing special here. The only reason I rented it was that it was \\"based on the exploits of Ian Fleming\\". While I'm not a big James Bond fan I thought it would be interesting for that reason alone. Sean Bean plays the leader of a British commando unit, and I got the mistaken impression he was playing Fleming. Nope. Fleming was a naval officer \\"involved\\" with the commandos, but he stayed in England while they went on a combat mission. WTF? The movie was okay, but I felt a little cheated.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Keep in mind that this masterpiece was literally 'thrown together' in a month's time using bits and piece of songs the Beatles had lying around from the previous few years.  The guitar playing all over the album is some of Harrison's and the others' best guitar work.  It is their most 'modern' sounding album and hangs together very well.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Our son gave us a beautiful and nice HDTV for Christmas.  Huge surprise!!! especially since we all agreed to not have a gift exchange for the adults in our family this year.    We did not see the ending of the Harry Potter series as yet and we wanted to begin our new adventure into Blu ray with movies that we were sure would be really good and that would demonstrate the effects of having Blu ray technology.  We already have seen several of the Harry Potter movies at the movie theater, and have the first six Harry Potter movies at home on regular DVD.    Having watched them several times, and expecting to purchase the remaining ones anyway...for about $40-$50, it seemed appropriate to choose the Blu ray version and get the whole series at once.  To continue with the technology of this 21st century, we bought a nice Panasonic Blu ray player and will get some Logitech speakers with a sub-woofer in the next few weeks to enhance the sound. We are really looking forward to it!    The price of the Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection (Blu ray) was good and a deciding factor to go this route. The cost of getting the last 2 movies would have been approximately $50 anyway, so spending a little more to purchase this set was a good choice for us.    The set contains only the movies (without the extra discs that we don't really use at all anyway).  The container is nice and has clear blue plastic book-like pages which are practical for holding the discs securely and all in one place. The jacket is nice for protecting the \\"book\\". The quality of the movies speak for themselves, and we are very happy with our purchase of this Blu ray collection. Just another note....it arrived in a short time and in perfect condition.  Very happy with every one of our Amazon experiences.  Signed: Dolores Jones

B005D0RDKW|5.0|Can they give a bad show? Lots here to love for fans including the coolest steam-punk stage set-up. Neil's drum kit is BEAUTIFUL!! I want to own it & I'm not even a drummer. I first saw Rush in 1977(I'd already been a fan for a couple of years) & lastly in 2011,a span of 34 years so the Time Machine theme seemed so very appropriate to me. I love the acting bits they work the concert around. Priceless stuff, especially for those of us who where fans from the start. The complete Moving Pictures? Great idea.Wonderful idea.Next tour please do Signals(or 2112, or Presto, or...). Better yet just keep touring(& making blu-rays)till you do them all! Love these guys, best band in the world for my money.
1451627289|5.0|I'm not a Stephen King fan by any stretch of the imagination, having only read one of his books so far, but I have to say this one was one of the best books I've read in a long time.

0385344228|5.0|These days, lawyer-and-courtroom books are a dime a dozen. Fortunately, Defending Jacob is no ordinary lawyer-and-courtroom book. It's smart, suspenseful, and a downright insightful look into an ordinary family that is on the road to implosion. Along the way, it has much to say about teenage angst, psychology, the latest genetic techniques, social media, family dynamics and more. Put another way, it's a work of literary fiction as well as a page-turning thriller.<br /><br />Andy Barber is the first assistant district attorney with a attractive and empathetic wife, Laurie, and a typically moody teenage son, Jacob. He is also the holder of a secret: his father and grandfather were both arrested for violent murder. Suddenly, he is forced to face a parent's worst nightmare. His son's classmate is stabbed to death and gradually, the circumstantial evidence against his own son is overwhelming. This master of self-control and self-delusion is forced to consider whether the son he loves to distraction is capable of a heinous murder.<br /><br />Is Jacob simply a teenager going through the usual throes of angst and alienation or is he the cold-blooded killer that the prosecutor portrays? How far will Andy go and what will he sacrifice to protect his beloved son? Some of the plot twists are a bit reminiscent of The Bad Seed, a 1954 novel by William March that was turned into an Academy-Award-nominated film with a \\"nature versus nurture\\" examination. But will the story end up the way that The Bad Seed did? Linday is smart enough to keep a kernel of doubt in his readers' minds.<br /><br />This author excels in creating \\"teenspeak\\" dialogue. His teenagers - from Jacob himself to Derek Yoo, his best friend who turns to the prosecution, to Jacob's schoolmates - are so real they could step off the pages. This is some of the most believable teen dialogue I've ever seen. The only misstep is Landay's creation of Andy's father, who comes off as cartoonish, particularly in contrast to his other gripping characters.<br /><br />While reading this, I could barely come up for air; the turns and twists, the family revelations, the emotional depth were all done with sophistication and aplomb. All the while, Linday educates the reader about the courtroom without crossing the line into authorial intrustion. I'm rating this 5-star, not in comparison to, say, War and Peace, but in comparison to others of its genre. Thanks to NetGalley for providing me with a copy for my Kindle; my review is my own opinion and not influenced in any way.While reading this, I could barely come up for air; the turns and twists, the family revelations, the emotional depth were all done with sophistication and aplomb.

0385523912|5.0|Picked this out for my book club on a friend's recommendation, and the mild curiosity I had when I started \\"Nothing to Envy\\" grew to fascination, incredulity and horror as I learned more and more about life in North Korea generally and specifically for these six \\"ordinary\\" people.  I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't be seriously moved and amazed by these stories, and the author writes simply and beautifully.  It was a quick read and not only did I finish it in a couple of days because I couldn't put it down, I still can't stop thinking about the book.  This is a story that really must be told to the world at large, and provides important(and frightening) context and insight to the insular, dangerous regime of North Korea.

As hard times get harder and necessities are more and more scarce, Liesel begins to steal to supplement their household. When she steals a book it brings her as much enjoyment as the scarce fresh fruit she steals. This book follows Liesel's life and those she comes in contact with. Told from Death's point of view, the story is both engaging and heartbreaking.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Cleary upon immediate play this is not as heavy as other Opeth releases. It plays in the same lines as \\"Damnation,\\" and in some way (for me)is like a continuation of it, and it works.  I appreciate the heavy and more brutal songs from their catalog, still, this cd is a great effort.  Artist/Musicians, must be allowed to grow and be creative; we cannot box them into what we feel they should sound like, rather we need to allow them to be innovative. Thanks Opeth for the different musical vibe once again...it feels great to engaged the mind that way.

1439102732|4.0|Jodi Picoult always deals with moral/ethical issues that make you reevaluate your side of the issue. In all of her books I think I know which side of the issue I stand on, and then, after getting into the book, I find it's harder to make a definitive stand on either side, you begin to understand that each issue is full of shades of gray.

1250004217|4.0|This novel is based on the historical Vel d'Hiv round up which took place in Paris in 1942. Julia Jarmond is an American journalist who married into a French family. As she researches her article she uncovers a link to her husband's family who acquired an apartment after the Jewish family who lived there was deported 60 years before. She discovers that their daughter, Sarah, who was 10 at the time her family was dispossessed, was the only surviving family member. Julia tries to track Sarah down, and in the process, finds herself.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book had me from the start just like the previous three novels. I am a late-comer to these novels so I did not have the long wait in between books for this one to come out and that may be why I am not so jaded in my review of this. I understand the anger and frustration of not having some our favourite characters here and to say that nothing happened in this book is not totally false either, but the characters we do have we get to watch them grow more and even change from who they were when we first met them to something else entirely. I am looking forward to continuing on to Dance with Dragons and hope the book after does not take another 5-6 years to come out.
0156030306|4.0|Both uplifting and sad, this book details the journey of Algernon, a brilliant lab mouse, and Charlie, a mentally disabled man. Algernon is treated with an experimental brain surgery to increase his IQ, and after it's success, Charlie eagerly volunteers to be the first human subject of this experimental treatment. Charlie's IQ grows by leaps and bounds until he becomes smarter than the doctors who performed this surgery, and he begins to accomplish more than anyone ever imagined. When Algernon inexplicable begins to deteriorate - Charlie grows fearful of sharing his fate. This book makes you wonder if it is better to have never had something, or to experience something wonderful, then live with the pain of losing it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Wow. This book was awesome! I was very hesitant to start reading this series. My husband had actually read this book back when it first came out and I avoided it. But after the 5th book came out and I noticed it was on the best-selling lists for months and the HBO series was a huge hit I decided to give it a try and boy was I not disappointed!!! This book had me after the first paragraph! Martin has real gift for detail. I can't believe for a book of this size how he manages to suck you in and not let up. The only warning that I would give is to animal lovers and women - there are a few scenes that did make me squirm. Other than that, highly recommend this book to anyone even if you are not a real fan of the fantasy genre.
1594744769|4.0|This book was so interesting - not just the story, but the presentation of the story - it is complete with photos of the characters which makes you feel as if you were sitting in the story teller's living room, flipping through an old photo album while listening to their stories. This is a book I will re-read and share.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Wonderful movie and the cinnamatography was excellent. Opening scenes in Paris feels like you are right there, amazing.  The context of the film and the time periods make this one exceptional.  My husband enjoyed watching it also with me. I highly recommend this movie.  Received it quickly from the seller too.
159562015X|1.0|This book has an access code in the back to take an assessment; this is to help you find your strengths.  I honestly can't review the *book* itself or the assessment yet, I bought it for a class and it will be assigned later in the semester. The code for the assessment, though, can only be used by one person. Since the purpose of the book IS the assissment, the book becomes unusuable by a second user.  From what I heard about the book from others who have previously taken the class and from the instructor who has taught it for years, it's a good tool to help find individual strengths and from reading the first couple of chapters, it's very easy to read. Without prior knowledge of this code, though, just trying to save a few dollars by buying this book used is actually throwing your money away.  I will have to purchase the book again; please don't make the same mistake I did.

081297381X|1.0|This book is essentially one enormous stroke of the author's own ego. It is sloppily written, using condescending, highly colloquial language and fabricated examples. Although the central premise is interesting, it is explained circuitously and does not carry enough value to sustain the book's length, but is rather used to repeatedly beat the reader around the head. The main purpose of this book is for the author to mock intellectual and learned types, while he poses as a higher mind who knows more than anybody else but is somehow immune to the self same mockery because he really really really knows more than anybody. A pathetic book, I do not know why it is so highly rated. A one trick pony much like Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. No wonder they get along.
1400082773|5.0|I was looking for this book to add to my personal reading items after borrowing a copy from the public library.  It was priced way below the bookstores in my area so I placed my order and I can say how pleased I was with the condition and timely manner in which it was sent.  I received this item five days after I placed my order.  I would certainly use this company again.

1591391105|5.0|Gives great pointers such as a Diagnostic Framework for Managing Change flowchart(Awareness, Diagnosis, Vision, Plan, Support), the challenges & opportunities for a StartUp, Turnaround, Realignment, and Success-Sustaining corporations. Avoiding Common Traps when it comes to addressing complicated alignment problems, such as Automating problem processes, as can become more amplified, making changes for change's sake--\\"resist the temptation to teardown the fences before you know why they were put up.\\"  Lots of good insights into how to gain support from your boss, influencing your peers and subordinates into the right direction. The author seems to be almost speaking from experience, as he gives a real 360 approach on how to handle a leadership position, including the politics/group dynamics of it all.  To fully grasp and appreciate this book, one needs to have been in, at minimum, a managerial position and has had a fair amount of organizational behavior experience, whether it was in a greek group or a volunteer group.  Overall, it is very comprehensive and can take awhile to read, but well worth it.

B0053VKP8S|1.0|I get nothing but noise when I turn on (bring back from sleep) my Apple TV 2.  That is until I go into settings (each time) and change any audio setting to any new value. It could even be setting it back to Dolby Digital. Then the sound crackles and goes normal. Once it's working, it sounds fine. But it seems to need that setting change to snap back to life.  I am not sure if I should return the unit, or it's normal behavior. Any comments would be helpful.  EDIT:  Well the problem has not gone away. What's worse, every minute or so I get crazy feedback. I even went to the Apple store and exchanged my Apple TV, thinking that it may be the problem. No, it isn't. Returning this ... thing.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wall Flower is a gem among books.  Charlie, the main character, will doubtlessly be compared to Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye, but Charlie lives in the 1990s, and his story, written in a series of letters to a friend, deals with modern issues facing teenagers including sex and parental oversight.  The author co-wrote the popular TV series \\"Jericho,\\" and he brings to this book an understanding of the conflicts and joys of personal relationships.  It is a quick read, as it is hard to put down, and it delivers a surprising last chapter that few will see coming.  Great closure.

Moneyball refers to wealthier teams getting the better players and in this film we see Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill coming up with a new analysis on how to effectively use baseball players who are underrated. It's a nice ride as to how the Oakland A's had their big wins  Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a supporting roll as the A's manager. Note that this is based on a novel of a similar title by Michael Lewis. Baseball fans will enjoy this picture more than me.

B00000AFGM|4.0|4.5 out of 5 stars, a.k.a an A minus.<br /><br />It's been said by a lot of people that Marilyn Manson is no longer relevant. The novelty of his weirdness has grown stale and conservatives have grown bored of being outraged by him. While it is true that he's no longer 'Murica's whipping boy, I must object to the dismissive, cynical tone of these critics' observations. As someone who's always been more concerned with music as it stands alone, I'm actually quite pleased that all that noise has died down. It's the perfect time to go back to Used CD bin and re-evaluate the actual music that he and his band made and put on record in the 90's for future generations to hear.<br /><br />\\"Mechanical Animals\\" has aged well, both in terms of the music and the lyrical themes. While it has the electronics-heavy sound that characterized the latter half of the 90's, it's still a Rock album, and personally I don't think good Rock music ever gets old. It's still the music that will set the body, mind and soul free. Thick, old-school heavy metal guitar riffs are in abundance. There are echoes of 70's giants like Mick Ronson and Tony Iommi in the heavier songs, but on top of that you can hear the corrosive electrified noise that's been brought over by Manson's Industrial/NIN influences. The drums give the music swagger, stomping and marching along.  Meanwhile, the various electronic embellishments give it a bit of a Pop sheen. It's interesting how something can sound both grating and polished at the same time. The result is something that is dark, but also catchy and a lot of fun. It kind of makes me wanna dance.<br /><br />I've always really liked Manson's vocal style. He sounds damaged and sick. This means that he's excellent at conveying pain in the sadder, slower moments of this album, and sounding monstrous and extremely, genuinely pissed off in the heavier, faster moments. Rock has never been about a singer's vocal range, after all, but rather his or her ability to be expressiveand throw themselves into a performance<br /><br />On to the lyrics. Mechanical Animals seems a bit like two albums that have been shuffled together. About half the songs sound kind of like a more wicked version of 70's Glam Rock, with super-cynical lyrics and biting sarcasm. The Pop elements of these songs (big choruses, hooks) sound almost satirical. Manson seems to be mocking both the sleaze-tastic, superficial media and his own over-the-top Rockstar lifestyle. The other songs--power ballads, almost--show a different side of these same concepts. These songs are full of a deep despair and lamentations about numbness and hollowness. In the last 40 years or so, we've seen albums that are similar, Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" and David Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" being the major standouts. \\"Mechanical Animals\\" has borrowed a lot from these albums. All three are concept albums based on a fictional Rock and Roller. Bowie has Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, Pink Floyd the band has Pink Floyd the man, and Marilyn Manson has Omega and the Mechanical Animals. And only two years after \\"Mechanical Animals\\", The Smashing Pumpkins did the same thing, creating Glass and the Machines of God for the \\"Machina\\" albums.<br /><br />I've said that this has aged well, and it has. One of the main themes of this album and a lot of Marilyn Manson's 90's stuff is fakery and superficiality. Veneers, hypocrites, materialists, people being turned into overblown and grotesque parodies of humanity itself. I think of this whenever I look at magazines. All those photoshopped actresses and models, all those ridiculous, expensive outfits, all those displays of obscene wealth and decadence. And how we eat it all up and love it, and, I suspect, secretly hate ourselves for what we are. We want to be stars, working to be as successful, beautiful and artificial as a celebrity. The album also has a futuristic vibe to it. Fear of technology was a big thing in the late 90's, what with that Y2K scare andthe rise of the Internet. Movies like \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Videodrome\\" had taught people to be both afraid of and fascinated by computers. I feel like today people have eased into this a bit more. I know people who talk about their ipads and phones like they're their little friends. It's pretty weird, when you think about it. I'm one of those who's still afraid of technology and our growing dependence on it, so that aspect of the album really resonates with me.<br /><br />So in conclusion, this album holds up as both a collection of really fun, Pop-tinged music and an artistic statement.
B004WSX60M|5.0|First 8 Cash LPs remastered with bonus Sun and Columbia singles on 4 CDs. This collection is loaded. There are no liner notes, just a plastic case with original release dates, but the sound quality is mostly great. I believe these are the Columbia remasters, because the extra songs are similar, but I have no way of verifying that. These are EU import CDs. The CDs look like mini-vinyl LPs with the CD label \\"Real Gone\\" imprinted on each one. Nothing fancy, but at least it looks like some care went into the production.  If, like me, you have always wanted a collection of early Sun/Columbia-era Cash, and are satisfied cherry-picking titles throughout the remainder of his career, this will do nicely.

1612130607|5.0|And so E.L. James brings to a close the story of an innocent young woman and her troubled young man. She did not disappoint. We learn how Anastasia and Christian grow as a couple and like with any couple there are ups and downs but in the end they both learn how deeply their love for one another goes. You'll laugh; you'll cry; you'll get frustrated with both of them. As the story winds down you can't help but be happy for them in spite of Anastasia's bullheadedness and Christian's Fifty Shades.

B006T5FDLG|5.0|If you're like me and followed the making of Death Magnetic on Mission Metallica, then you couldn't help but be disappointed when Death Magnetic came out. A great album, but there was indeed some really good material left off. Beyond Magnetic fills in the gap. While listening to this EP, I couldn't help but say to myself, \\"ooh I remember that!\\" and I'm sure you'll find yourself doing the same. The four previously unreleased Death Magnetic tracks are here in the same horrible Death Magnetic production. Look out for Rebel Of Babylon, it can get a bit thrashy. And if anyone is wondering where \\"Shine\\" is, it's re-titled Just A Bullet Away.

The layout is a bit clunky (for example: the exercises could be grouped in a more logical way to make them easier to reference). The larger problem is the physical book. It is not very sturdy. I suspect that the only way the binding could be any poorer would be to sell the book as loose letters and numbers poured into a plastic bag. The pages began shedding from the spine on day 2. Very sad.

1451648537|3.0|Transcendental hippie who smelled bad? Know-it-all, overly self-aware jerk? Self-centered eccentric? Or a dedicated genius of modern times? Who was Steve Jobs, and why are people flocking to a 571-page biography written about him? I knew little about this guy prior to reading \\"Steve Jobs,\\" so this was a good, if overwritten, place to start. It turns out Jobs was a complex conglomeration of all the above descriptors and much more.<br /><br />Author Walter Isaacson has an easy-to-read style that covers a riveting life in full depth. Delving right away into Jobs's early world as an adopted child, the book transplants readers effortlessly into California during the 1960s, `70s and 80s, a magical period when the computer industry was booming and full of promise. Jobs was the experimental type who took LSD, adhered to funky diets, maintained an artistic outlook and had a knack for and interest in electronics. As time went on, he accurately predicted what computers could offer the masses. His true talent wasn't computer programming, but Jobs was undoubtedly a visionary who, through the force of his personality, worked hard to release easy-to-use, aesthetically pleasing products -- products he viewed as the antitheses of Microsoft -- to a large number of people.<br /><br />Jobs's artistic imaginativeness, mixed with business acumen and demanding ways, got him to the top of his field -- but he was far from a pleasant, reasonable person. By the time his story reached the mid-1980s, I wasn't even rooting for him to stay on at Apple; his behavior was that erratic and deplorable. But a funny thing happened the further on I read: Jobs actually kind of grew on me. He was a minimalist vegan who threw fits and could barely scrape together three friends for his nonalcoholic bachelor party. He married late in life, didn't do furniture at his bachelor pad and had a cake at his wedding that was practically inedible (thanks to not adding refined products like eggs and milk in it). This is viewed as weird stuff to most people, but Jobs was a true individual who made things happen and drummed to his own beat. You've got to respect that.<br /><br />I couldn't stay interested in the last one-fourth of the book, which related Steve's product comeback with Apple and his irrational distaste for vital things like Google and the Droid. Maybe it's because items like the iPod and iPad, as well as entities like iTunes and Pixar, have all been invented too recently and are too much a part of popular culture to feel worthwhile in a retrospective book. That said, others may love reading about Jobs's more recent accomplishments, his obsession with Bob Dylan, his endless boardroom deals or his time with Bono. Isaacson can't be accused of skimping on details, but he may have overdone it by 200 pages or so.uff to most people, but Jobs was a true individual who made things happen and drummed to his own beat.

B001IMFHTS|5.0|Simply outstanding. These are powerful, elegantly performed, with crystalline sonics and well-balanced visuals. Others have observed the relative youth of the orchestra. No longer the almost all-male group of past years. It is the set I go to in order to enjoy Beethoven. Abbado conducts with parsimonious energy. The tempos are indeed faster than usual, but the harmonies are still clearly articulated.<br /><br />Do note that the version of the Ninth Symphony is in a different venue--I assume the Berliner's home hall. It is not quite up to the quality of the rest of the set, but still very good.<br /><br />At this price, the set is a steal. Get it before it goes out of print again. Even if you have another set, get it.

0525423281|4.0|Lola and the Boy Next Door By Stephanie Perkins<br />''<br />There is something about Stephanie Perkins. What she writes is magnetic.<br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is the follow-up companion novel to Perkins' 2010 debut Anna and the French Kiss and follows Delores `Lola' Nolan, a budding teenage fashion designer whose life is turned upside down when her childhood playmates the Bell twins move back in next door. Lola is particularly stricken by the reappearance of Cricket Bell, who broke her heart.<br /><br />Lola, as well as its predecessor Anna, are chick-lit at its finest.<br />While many elements that make the work of some writers in this genre seem melodramatic are represented (drug addict mother, bad boy vs. nice guy, over-protective parents etc.), the story progresses without seeming over-stated or soap opera-esque. This book doesnt try to be sentimental or gritty. It relies on balancing comfort and warmth with excitement to engage the reader and deliver the happy ending. It does not play in to the cliches of the genre. Also, its funny.<br /><br />What I Loved:<br />The characters - not a cardboard cut-out steryotype in sight.<br /><br />What Was Lacking:<br />More pages!

0385534639|4.0|I have now read this book 3 times!  I started it the second time a few hours after my first finish.  For the 3rd time, I read it out of order: 1st I read all the second-person point of views of walking through the circus, then I read all of Baily's parts, then the main story of C. and M.  That was an amazing way to take in the story.  Yes, the characters are flat...that's what makes them so mysterious.  It's all so dream-like because there is so much you don't know...even by the end of the book.  So who is the man in the grey suit, really?  At one point, he seems symbolic of God--while Prospero seems symbolic of Satan.  This book can be as deep or as shallow as you want it to be.  Enjoy the dream!

It is great to be able to think through questions briefly and deeply-it is therapeutic and a nice end to every day.  The cool thing about this Q&A Journal is that it looks so nice. The binding is metallic gold and the covers have a lot of character. It is definitely a book that will age well.  The one issue that I have with this journal is that sometimes it asks questions that I believe are not likely to change over any amount of time but then again maybe that it just the fact that I am a hypercritical cultural anthropologist! ;)

0763644765|4.0|I was looking for a good potty book to help coax my 2 year old into potty training. She loves books, so I knew a good book would help her enthusiasm and get her attention. This one is a winner for us! The pictures and text are simple - no reason to over-complicate the process and make it intimidating. It's also gender neutral, which I like. We have a girl, and an unknown on the way, and I would be completely comfortable sharing this book with either a little boy or girl. Our daughter likes to read this even when it's not potty time, and has memorized it, so she can 'read' it to us or herself while on the potty.

0439023521|4.0|Well what can I say about The Hunger Games that hasn't been said already. This book has been on my TBR pile for awhile now and thanks to Adam @ Roof Beam Reader I finally put it on my list to get read this year (plus the movie is coming out and I didn't want to see that before I read the book).<br /><br />Almost everyone knows what the plot is to The Hunger Games. It is set in a dystopian world that for fun (like the Romans and the Colosseum) like to pit children from different Districts against each other in a battle to the death. Now each District has certain advantages depending on what their District is noted for. Katniss and Peeta are from District 12, one of the poorest of the Districts. Katniss originally is not drawn but instead her sister, Prim, is. Katniss knows that Prim would not stand a chance if she goes, so Katniss volunteers to go.<br /><br />Right away, Katniss and Peeta's sponsors know that they have to be very creative so they play the forlorn lovers angle. Katniss, whose best friend Gale (love triangle alert) is watching back home is forced to go along (or is she?). Katniss and Peeta really compliment each other. Peeta has the strength and Katniss has the brains.<br /><br />I did enjoy Collin's dystopian world. There is a lot that I know is going to happen in the next two books that I look forward to reading. A caution to all YA readers is that some parts are quite violent but what would you expect when you are fighting to the death. Great read and I think it will be a hit when the movie comes out. Collin's writing is quite visual and I could see some of these scenes play out on the big screen.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|When trailers for Drive came out before the release of the movie, I thought the trailers kind of made it look like a Fast and the Furious type of movie. I am so glad i didnt let that keep me from seeing Drive. It is nothing like Fast and the Furious, which i guess is ok, if thats something that you like. I do not. This isnt a review for that either. So on to Drive. It is a brilliant crime story set in modern times, but with a 1980's feel to it. If that makes any sense. The writing, acting, pacing, setting, plot --everything is top notch. Gosling and Cranston especially stand out. The music/soundtrack is also fantastic and definitely worth buying also. For me, this was the best movie i have seen since The Dark Knight came out a few years back. A++++!!!!!!

0439023513|5.0|I'm giving this a five because I enjoyed it and found it a page turner (or kindle clicker).  This isn't to say the many criticisms are invalid. In fact, they are. As I read through some of the negative reviews here most of the complaints are spot-on. Suzanne Collins could have, and should have done much better with wrapping up certain things. I can only assume she was rushed, and I'm somewhat surprised I'm even giving it a five. But, in the end, yep I enjoyed it. There's more right in this, I suppose, than wrong.  MILD SPOILER BELOW, only relevant if you've read Orwell's 1984  I have to admit it took more than half the book for me to finally shake that fear that the author was going to rip off a primary plot line from 1984, a spectacular book. Thankfully, that fear was unfounded.
B004EPZ02A|3.0|So, I been a horror fan for the last 30+ years, and it takes a lot to scare me now. Paranormal 1 & 2 did it. They did it while making sense and working together perfectly. The 3rd of them though... I'll start by saying it does have good scares in it, not much real chills like the other two, but still some scares. You won't sit curled up in a ball covering your eyes the whole movie, its more traditional jump at you scares.  But the story is what gets me. It doesn't quite make sense for rooms to be tossed around, kids screaming, and the grown-ups in the film don't hear it. Or that the boyfriend is filming everything, gets some amazing footage, and doesn't force the mother to sit down and watch whats happening to her kids at night. And the end... It left me so dissapointed. Unless they are setting it up for Paranormal 4, it makes absolutely no sense with the first two. Both of the earlier films mention a fire that wipes out the house, and never mentions what happens to the mother and boyfriend. Not to spoil too much, but you do get the impression the whole family moved away together and alive, so how does the end of this movie fit into it? Answer, it doesn't. It has a few good scares, but nothing like the chills the first two had. And definitely not the continuity. You can watch it, but just keep your expectations low, so you won't be as dissapointed as I was.

1401207529|5.0|This is the graphic novel that all other origin stories try to emulate. The gold standard in the comic world for setting the table in the Batman universe. Of all of the stories of the Batman this is my favorite. A must have for all batfans.  The duel origins of Bruce Wayne and Jim Gordon gives this book balance and in many was more about the future commissioner than that of Batman.
B000000OSW|5.0|I disagree that there is no filler in this album. For example, I've never enjoyed Only Us much or Washing of The Water. In fact, I always skip Steam, despite it being one of the more popular ones on this album.  I'm giving it five stars because a few tracks--Come Talk To Me, Digging In The Dirt, Kiss That Frog are superb.  Of course the gem, the undeniable masterpiece of this album is Secret World. This is a magical track itself worth more than most other albums I've heard over the years.

0756405890|3.0|First, let me say that there are a lot of good things to say about this book.  Number one, there seems to be a consensus among most of the reviewers that Rothfuss is a good writer as far as his word usage and ease of style. For the most part, the prose is intriguing, easy to follow, and at times (but not always) inspired.  However, there are other times when it feels a little (or a lot) overdone.  My problem with the book isn't about the writing as much as it is about almost everything else.  Starting with the plot, which, in my opinion, is fairly banal and uninteresting.  It starts in a tavern, as so many cliched fantasy stories do.  There are a lot of cookie cutter characters to begin the novel--the smith's 'prentice (try not to roll your eyes), the old storyteller, the farmer, a couple rowdier, younger guys, and the innkeeper, Kvothe, who turns out to be the main character.  Then there's the story at the beginning that lasts about 100 pages, and it has nothing to do with the rest of the book.  I'm sure Rothfuss will tie it all in at the end, in subsequent books, but as far as this book goes, you can pretty much skip the first 100 pages and not miss anything at all.  The real story starts when Kvothe starts telling his story to the aptly named Chronicler.  Rothfuss called this \\"metafiction\\" but it's not really metafiction.  Metafiction is fiction about fiction.  This is just a story within a story (and sometimes it's a story within a story within a story within a story), not metafiction.  I don't want to give any spoilers, so I won't go into any details about the plot, but suffice it to say that, aside from being pretty non-epic, the plot has so many holes in it that you can't help but wonder whether any editors actually looked at the book before it went to print, or, if they did, whether they were completely ignored.  Just because it bothered me so much, I'll name this one--Kvothe is supposed to be this great performer, bred from a long tradition of \\"troupers\\", but when he is poor and destitute, he never thinks once to use any of his talents to improve his situation, instead becoming somewhat of an Oliver Twist type character.  Then there are the characters--most of them are pretty shallow, cliche characters with little or no motivation for what they do.  Even Kvothe is not very interesting because he's good at absolutely everything.  He knows everything and there is never really an obstacle that you feel he won't easily overcome.  He keeps talking about his \\"bad luck\\" but when bad things happen, he always comes out of it easily with almost no consequences.  Boring.  I guess his biggest (only?) flaw is that he is not good with women.  But somehow every woman he meets falls in love with him (even though he is supposed to be only 15.  Seriously, would any of the women in this book fall in love with a 15 year old?  Fella, Denna?  Does Rothfuss know any 15 years olds?).  Other characters who are supposed to be main characters have almost no depth--why does Hem hate him?  Because he gave him a hotfoot?  His arch-rival, Ambrose, is his arch rival because . . . um . . . well . . . he embarrassed him in front of a girl?  Hmmmm, not much motivation for two of the main antagonists in the story.  I also don't like the fact that the world is supposed to be a medieval setting--with inns, horses, swords, nobles, etc.--but everyone seems to have american sensibilities, the university seems very modern, and the \\"Masters\\" and their students seem to already know everything about modern science and medicine.  Hmmmm.  It just doesn't seem to fit.  All that said (and trust me there are many more flaws that I don't want to go into because I don't want to give any of the plot away for those of you who still want to read it), I didn't hate the book.  As I said, the writing is good.  Some of the ideas are well thought out and interesting.  But, I just don't think he has the chops (yet) to pull something like this off--he didn't pull it off.  I hopeWise Man's Fear gets better because I think Rothfuss and this story have potential, but I'm not holding my breath.  As far as this being \\"the best debut novel from a writer in decades\\" like one review said--not even close.  I don't even have to go back that far to find someone better--Scott Lynch, The Lies of Locke Lamora, was way better (although also not without flaws).  I could name others, but you get the point.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover, it's beautiful and elegant and works wonderfully. It didn't lay flat at first, but after handling it for a few days that problem was resolved. People are always surprised when I tell them it's not leather because of the look and feel of it. It's one of my happiest purchases and one that I strongly recommend!
B003LPV960|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie so much, that I had to order it again in Blu-Ray. Liked it much better than Nanny McPhee: The Return
B006WPSQVC|5.0|It was very good, the triumph and the moral of the movie was excellent. I would recommend this movie. this is an edited review. Right after watching I felt very doomed and gloom from the tragedy. It broke my heart. But after a while, i could see how many were touched by it. It just showed how God always works and brings all together for the good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The variety of Bible versions and Bible reading and devotions makes this a must have app. It is easy to use and never crashes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|In the beginning it was fun and challenging, but by the third group, I kept having to play games over and over to get a massive amount of points and it just gets boring after a while. I do love the game because its an amazing time killer, and I love the concept, just wish it wasn't so dang hard to earn more games!
B0067QPVD2|4.0|Sequels (or in this case, a prequel) to classic films is always a no-win scenario -- try to take the story in a totally different direction and you run the risk of raising the ire of fans of the original. On the other hand, make it all too familiar and you'll invite comparisons to what people will inevitably think is a superior original.  That being said, this prequel, called simply The Thing, is actually a pretty good film if taken on its own merits. The director is obviously a huge fan of the John Carpenter version, and takes great pains trying to keep this film as close in tone and detail to the Carpenter film. Even the  CGI effects, while doing stuff that was never possible with the original film's mostly practical effects, looks close enough to the original's effects that the comparison isn't too jarring.  I admit I'm possibly one of the biggest fans of John Carpenter's The Thing there is -- I own the film on every format, from VHS to HDVD and Blu-ray-- and I came into the prequel with negative expectations but came away pleasantly surprised. The film is much better than most critics say it is and in fact i was thoroughly entertained throughout. It also successfully treads the thin line between being a rehash and a film that offers something extra for fans of the original.  Remember, the Carpenter version didn't do all that well either when it was released theatrically and even critically, it was often cited as an inferior version of the Howard Hawkes version. It was only in video that Carpenter's The Thing has slowly gained the acclaim that it so deserves, and I feel this is the case with this new prequel to The Thing.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book draws the reader in and makes you stay up until the wee hours of the morning to read more!  The author's grammar can be less than desirable at moments, but the story line is creative and unique enough to make you disregard the grammar.  It is an easy read and very worthy of 5 stars.  I am looking forward to the next two books and wishing there were more!

B002HFJ77S|5.0|This was a great book by Sophie Kinsella.  I have read most of her books to date, and this is one of my favorites.  She is a joy and her characters are believable (in an unbelievable situation).  Witty and fun..it was a book I couldn't put down.  Looking forward to the next Kinsella book!
0307593312|5.0|I just finished 1Q84 and was blown away. I have read all of Haruki Murakami's books and to me this is his finest work to date. I have seen some reviews that said it started out slow, however; I found the tempo of the story to be just right. I have read the book at a leisurely rate. I pre ordered the book and received it at the begining of November 2011 and have read about ten to twenty pages a day. This allowed me to think and evaluate the story. Also, I wanted the journey to last as long as possible. I truly fell in love with the character development and to me this is a key to a good story. If I cannot bond with the characters of the story it really doesn't matter how smart the story or wording is. This has to be the high point of Murakami's writing and one of the best novels I have read in a long time. I just hope to see more of his works in the future.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|easy to pick up &amp; fun to play.  no thought required,  just good ol fashioned reflexes. great game as the free app of the day.
0446573019|3.0|Mr. Baldacci is a skilled writer and I have enjoyed his previous novels. However, Zero Day was a disappointment mainly because of the flawed and implausible story line. An example. The US Government encased a Post-WWII atomic facility in concrete rather than removing all radioactive material and decontaminating the facility. It is fortunate that the government failed to seal off an adjacent abandoned coal mine (unknown to the government?) or else the antagonist would not have been able to convert the abandoned nuclear material into a sophisticated atomic bomb which threatened to turn a large part of the United States into a radioactive wasteland. Thank goodness, the protagonist was able to easily enter the abandoned facility through an overlooked massive ventilation system (a bureaucratic Oops?), reposition the remaining nuclear fuel into the abandoned coal mine, and lessen the explosive impact of the bomb with the aid of his federally imprisoned brother who, apparently, is the best (or perhaps only?) nuclear scientist in the US who can help to defeat this sinister plot by a group of rogue Homeland Security personnel, seeking to increase their meager retirement accounts. I gave this book three stars solely based on the strength of the first half of the book which was a page turner. Expect to be disappointed as you read further.
B002WY65W4|3.0|The Digital Copy DVD included will not work on Macs. There is no \\"Insert\\" in this product which has a code, only a iTunes shortcut which is for PPC, not Intel, so there is no way to run it in Lion. iTunes asks for a code, but without any insert there is no code to give it. Just be careful if you were expecting to enjoy the Digital Copy version of this and own a current Mac - You are out of luck.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this app for years on all my various phones and devices.  it's definitely the best one I've used.  I love the way my highlights, bookmarks, and notes sync flawlessly with my current devices (ipod touch, Droid 3, and Kindle Fire).  It's very handy to be able to switch versions for comparison so easily.  Many versions are available for downloading for offline reading.  I keep ky Kindle Fire in my purse and use it during church for my Bible.  I highly recommend this app!
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Beyond the in-depth film analysis that you can find elsewhere, it should be noted to any and all considering adding this 3D bluray to their stereoscopic collection that the 3D is just outstanding. Michael Bay and the Paramount execs decided to film this flick in native 3D and what a great decision that was. The first scene depicting the autobots fleeing Cybertron is an absolute 3D spectacle in its own right (granted entirely CGI). The depth contrast between the highly detailed Cybertron and the ships that surround it was a feast for the eyes. Another scene that comes to mind is the wing-suit team dropping in on Deceptacon occupied Chicago.  It also doesn't hurt that UPS did me a solid and delivered my copy a day ahead of the scheduled release so I was able to watch it a day before the rest of the country. What kind of Amazon prime member would I be if I didn't pay it forward with a 5 star review of the product?  Avatar, watch out because you finally have competition in the live-action 3D realm!
B001HN6922|4.0|My son loves this movie, maybe even more than Cars. We went to the theater when it first came out, then of course had to buy the DVD when it became available. It had a lot of Mater in it, and we were hoping to see more of Sally instead of just a cameo (that's why 4 stars instead of 5), but overall, a good movie. My son loves the spy theme and Finn McMissile's character. We definitely recommend this movie!
B0068TL23G|4.0|I like this game, it is very basic you are connecting color to color by drawing the shortiest line. You want to find the shortiest way possible to each line to connect similar colors. As you advance this gets harder and harder so you really have to think about the best moves to make. Good for some mindless fun yet challenges your brain to think of solutions.

B003XF1OJK|5.0|Like many \\"kids of the 80's\\" I've been a gamer since I was pretty much born.  So it's no surprise that, like many, I got caught up in the HALO game craze.  The thing I didn't ever look into, though, was the mythology.  The Master Chief was just a faceless character who had a nack for destroying anything, and everything, that endangered the Human Race.  Turns out... John is a lot more.  A friend gave me the first 3 for Christmas a while back, and told me that I had to at least give The Fall of Reach a read.  I advised him many times over it wasn't my bag of books, but he made me agree to at least give Nylund's take on the Halo backstory a fair shake.  Since I've known the guy for 15yrs I finally gave in, and later that night cracked open TFOR.  The next 24hrs are a blur of reading.  I couldn't put the book down.  I was glued to the pages, and anxiously kept reading.  I needed to know more about John, the Spartan II project, all these horrors these kids had to witness and participate in to eventually become the savior's of our future.  Needless to say reading this book gave me a WHOLE new insight into the games.  The Master Chief wasn't a generic tough guy anymore.  He was a young kid, thrown into a world he didn't ask for, and when he came out he had changed.  He became the man we saw fighting the Covenant, but not without a cost.  If nothing else... give the book a fair shake.  If you're a fan of the games, or just SciFi in general you're going to love it as much as I did.

1451627289|4.0|I am not a huge Stephen King fan his books are normally drawn out, confusing and boring but I actually enjoyed this one. A man befriend's an owner of a dinner who is dying. Turns out there is a \\"worm hole\\" in the back pantry that takes you to 1963. Every time you go down the worm hole you are in the same town on the same day at the same time, but when you come back to the present no matter how long you have been gone it has only been minutes. The dinner owners goal is to have this man save JFK from being killed. Very intersting story and I truly enjoyed it.

B0064MT1NU|5.0|This provocative and powerful story is like a fairytale for adults.  It's melancholy mood, vivid images and luxurious sounds resonated in me like no movie ever has.  The characters despair and passion, and the  extraordinary beauty captured by the camera all contribute to the haunting intimacy of this film.  It's by far my favorite movie... ever.

0439023513|5.0|A week back, I picked up a copy of The Hunger Games, really not knowing what to expect. I knew it was a bestseller, but that was about it. However, after reading the first chapter, I was engulfed by the world of Panem and the story of Katniss Everdeen. Little did I know, I would be captured by the books themselves.  Soon I found myself drawn once again by the engaging story of Catching Fire. In their hearts and in their minds, I noticed the dynamic progress of these characters changing by the course of war. At this point, there was no turning back. I grew too attached to these characters that I simply knew only days ago.  Then came Mockingjay. I was skeptical at first. I read a couple of the book reviews that suggest I might as well stop reading after the second book. Despite the negative reviews, I pressed forward with the intention of making my own opinion.  Mockingjay was all about change. We see Katniss Everdeen, the main narrating character, turn into someone ravaged by war, confused by her emotions, and twisted by those around her. The Katniss we knew back then was gone, but not dead. However, despite the bitterness that fell upon her world, she kept living. She had the will to go on even if she didn't know it herself. There are times when you feel she's about to give up, but even when she does, a turn of events corrects her path, as if subconsciously she knows of a hopeful future.  It's been a long time since I've read anything as engaging as The Hunger Games trilogy. Mockingjay, tragic at parts, ended the series beautifully. The book isn't for everyone, but for me, Katniss Everdeen, you have won.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|The album is just BRILLIANT!  There are no other words to describe this album.  Every track is good!  DO NOT HESITATE, BUY THE ENTIRE ALBUM!
B0059XTUEK|4.0|I finally caught up with this movie today.  I knew I would see a couple of excellent characterizations, but wasn't sure what to expect from the movie as a whole. I do have a soft spot for British settings, and loved the excellent of the cast, but what settled it for me was that I didn't want to break the spell when the movie ended.  Luckily, it was a small matinee audience, and I was there by myself, so was able to leave silently and drive home without noise or conversation. I can give this movie a strong 4+ rating for those who value excellent acting and a quiet but mesmerizing peek into storied lives.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|This cable did not work with my iPhone 4. I would receive an error when I would plug it in.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Great buy. The item was in a brand new package as specified and worked without a glitch. The size of memory and the labeling helped greatly.
B000TSJU0E|2.0|Reading the other reviews for this CD/DVD set made me feel very sad on so many levels.  Let's start with the \\"fantastic\\" mastering.  Fact; the CD is heavily volume maximised and clipped.  I have no issue with people who say they like the sound of the CD, beyond wondering if they are still listening to it even months later, but a quality hi-fi product it is not.  Next who make me sad are people who say this is ZZ Top's best album.  Surely only someone who got caught up in its popular success could say that, not a ZZ Top fan.  To be sure it is catchy and enjoyable, but it's just dumb synthesizer boogie.  About as far away from their blues roots as they ever got.  I'm also sad that it seems so many ZZ Top fans didn't stay with them after Eliminator/After Burner, as they, album by album, reclaimed that electric blues past, though with a punchier more gritty guitar sound.  Their last album, Mescalero, way back in 2003, would have been brilliant if it wasn't the worst mastered CD ever (EVER!).  XXX is pretty good if patchy too.  So while Tres Hombre remains my favourite, and El Loco is fantastic in its quirkiness, I'm glad to own the rest of them.  While Eliminator is disappointing by comparison and ushered in a string of weaker albums, it wasn't the end of the road.  The DVD is old TV 4:3 aspect ratio clips with stereo sound, don't expect 5.1 sound here.  Definitely some nostalgic value though, enjoyable to watch.  My advice is buy this cheap like I did, enjoy the packaging, enjoy the DVD, and stick the CD in the trash.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Warrior is the best sports film ever made in my opinion.  Should have been nominated for best picture, best actor (Tom Hardy), and best supporting actor (Nick Nolte).  There is nothing else to say about it.  How it was not a smash world wide hit is simply impossible for me to fathom.  In this world, there are injustices, and I feel on an art and cinematic level, that this is truly one of them.
B004WPYNY8|4.0|I was a bit disappointed by Symphony X's prior release, Paradise Lost. However, this album is at least a partial return to form. It still keeps with the more aggressive and darker metal sound they've been moving towards, with less of the \\"symphonic\\" side than some of their early albums, and Russell Allen uses more of his rough vocals rather than his smooth voice. However, the songs sound much better and more cohesive to me on this album than Paradise Lost - there's more melody and less aimless shredding. This may not be quite up with their best work, but it's a pretty good metal album. As others have mentioned, definitely get the limited edition, not the shortened version which is missing some of the best parts.

B005QJZ5FA|4.0|2012 has started with a great note! Lana Del Rey is one of the greatest new voices to rise up in years. Some say she's a B-version of Adele, and however true that may be, Lana deserves to be in a genre all by herself because of her unique style. \\"Video Games\\" is one of the most original songs I've ever heard and could cure deafness on first listen. It demands your attention from beginning to end. It has personality, it has emotion, it has romance, and, curiously, all juxtaposed against playing video games. It's an absolute work of art.<br /><br />But, of course, you already knew Video Games was great - which is probably why you're here.  Here's what I thought about the other tracks on the album.<br /><br />THE MAGNIFICENT, FANTASTIC, AND GREAT<br />  - \\"Video Games\\" - as previously explained<br /><br />  - \\"Born to Die\\" - the opening song is deliciously pessimistic, while somehow celebratory. Lana's vocals are top-notch (as always) and this is one of the tracks you'll want to play over and over.<br /><br />  - \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" - Proving that LDR can sing across genres, this subdued toe-tapper is a refreshing drink in the mix of today's endless 4-on-the-floor pop songs. It's hot, it's danceable, but, best of all, it still let's that glorious voice shine through. LOVE this song!<br /><br />  - \\"Off to the Races\\" - With a kick-back beat that reminds me a little bit of Jay-Z, this is another track not to miss! It's the perfect mix of pop and indie.<br /><br />  - \\"Summertime Sadness\\" - Again, here's a track with the curious ability to mix happiness and sadness. The result is wonderful. One of my favorites!<br /><br />THE VERY GOOD<br />  - \\"Blue Jeans\\" I should mention that I really love this song, and probably deserves to be in the \\"magnificent\\" group, but I'm going to give it a more moderate \\"Very good\\" rating because it fairly similar to \\"video games\\" without nearly as much vocal performance. Her voice sounds slightly held back and then the production is slightly weak. I would never skip over this track, but I do think it could have been done better.<br /><br />  - \\"Dark Paradise\\" - the title could describe Lana's voice, and expectantly, the song is extremely good.<br /><br />  - \\"Carmen\\" Another fantastic song that is only slightly weakened by some awkward lyrics and weak production. Lana's voice shines through though and makes the best of it, however.<br /><br />  - \\"Radio\\" a feel-good number that's extremely catchy! Can't put it in the same category as \\"Video games\\" but it deserves a high spot on the \\"very good\\" list.<br /><br />  - \\"What Makes Us Girls\\" another good song, that is weakened by the production. It sounds too much like the other songs when it should have it's own unique flare. Still good, but not fantastic.<br /><br />THE OKAY/DECENT<br />  - \\"National Anthem\\" This is the only song I don't like very much. The production is weak, Lana's voice doesn't get a chance to shine, the lyrics are only all right.<br /><br />  - \\"Million Dollar Man\\" - okay/decent is a great review for this song, because that's exactly what it is. Neither bad, nor noteworthy. Just kinda there.<br /><br />ENDING THOUGHTS: Although I endlessly love just about every song, the few weaker numbers seem to be mostly a fault of weak producing. I hope this album will bring on enough success that the next album can have a higher budget and better instrumentals. \\"Video Games\\" and many others are spot-on perfect, though, and none of the tracks are so bad you would want to skip. It's hard to find a true album these days, but this is one. You can pop it in, press play, and enjoy. No mixtape needed.ne better.    - \\"Dark Paradise\\" - the title could describe Lana's voice, and expectantly, the song is extremely good.    - \\"Carmen\\" Another fantastic song that is only slightly weakened by some awkward lyrics and weak production.

B005LAIIS0|5.0|Once more into the fray.<br />Into the last good fight I'll ever know.<br />Live and die on this day.<br />Live and die on this day.<br /><br />And with these words, the Grey becomes in my mind, the greatest film of its generation in this genre, although I am not quite sure what exact genre that is.<br /><br />I saw the Grey 4 days ago, on the big screen, and it has not left my mind since.  It is, by far, the best film I have seen in a very long time.  It is truly, as Mr. Neeson puts it, about \\"Men, unfit for mankind\\" against mother nature in all of her absolute fury, but most of all it is a pulse pounding and riveting exploration of loss and real courage, and faith, and how real men face almost insurmountable odds, and how men, in the worst of circumstances treat and regard their fellow man.  I was devastated by \\"the Grey\\" in all of its ferocious and poetic power.<br /><br />First, the acting was astounding.  From Mr. Liam Neeson (who is in my mind a bona fide action star with incredible acting ability) to Frank Grillo, and Dermot Mulrooney, and the rest of the cast, the acting was the best I have seen in ages.  The acting seemed so natural, and truly imitated the way real people, especially men, actually relate to each other. it is probably the first time I have ever actually seen it captured so well and naturally on film.<br /><br />  The cinematography, and the story were excellent.  The movie is grim, ultra violent, dark, but it is also an incredibly deft and soul wrenching journey into what it means to be a man and have real courage in the face of almost certain death?  It asks, how would I treat my fellow man in the worst hell the cosmos can conjure up? The Grey is also a film about and of faith, and of loss, and not just the loss that is depicted on film, but the silent loss and pain that so many men (maybe all men) have and go through in their lives and carry with them (whether it be self destructive in origin, or bad luck, or loss of loved ones, or what ever form it takes). The Grey is brilliant on both a physical and metaphorical level.<br /><br />  Truthfully, I was devastated by this film, and any time a character died, I felt each death so intensely (I looked around and there were grown men in the theater sobbing silently).  Anytime a character revealed himself, in terms of his life and his view/faith, his own loss, I was transfixed.  Some of these characters were seemingly rotten scoundrels, but ultimately I grew to give a damn about them, and their plight, and that. in my opinion, is the brilliance of \\"the Grey\\".  These men were revealed ultimately to be not scoundrels who were at their core bad men, but men, who had made too many mistakes, like so many of us, and just couldn't get their lives kick started out of the hurricane that consumes so many lost souls.  As a man viewing this, it struck me as an incredibly deep study of the true heart of man.  I felt that any one of these fellows could have been me or one of my friends out there.  I did not want in any moment, for any one of these characters to die.  I said to myself, I am watching a movie, a work of fiction, but am reacting like what was on screen was something real.  It felt that way to me.  And I can give \\"the Grey\\" no greater praise.  For example, when I learned towards the end, why Liam Neeson was so pained in his soul, it had a huge emotional impact on me.  A real and quiet impact.  I said to myself, this is the way that I would be if I experienced this, I think, although who can know until you go through something like that.<br /><br />  Other reviewers here have briefly summarized the plot far better than I could, and I would say that on its surface it is an extremely well told survival tale... extremely intense and violent, with 7 men trying to escape a ravenous pack of wolves hell bent on punishing them physically and metaphorically, but what is interesting is that the rest of mother nature nature was just as, if not more, brutal towards thesesouls as the wolves were.  It is almost as if the wolves could have been an afterthought to mother nature's fury and rage.<br /><br />For me, the Grey was not just a film, but an experience. If you are a deep thinking man or person, I believe that The Grey will be an experience for you to savor.  It is also a hell of an exciting movie, but I was so plugged in, that the excitement was just an after thought for me against the emotional intensity of this cinematic masterpiece.  Joe Carnahan, Liam Neeson, and all of you who made this happen, I say bravo to you, and tip my cup and hat to the masterpiece you have put on the screen.  Thank you.  Thank you.<br /><br />I have read some reviewers complaining about the ending, and I have to say to them, \\"Are you kidding me?\\"  It is the right ending.  Make sure you stay till the end of the credits and you will learn what happened.  Anyone who doesn't like the ending, I truly believe misses the point... of what the Grey is saying.  thank you for reading.<br /><br />P.S. I am absolutely interested in hearing other people's thoughts.  Feel free to send me some comments.
B004UC4HCG|4.0|The first Shuttle I got would Blue Screen (BSOD) with a stop code of x124 when I had a graphics card (GPU) installed (tried 3 difference cards and still got the BSOD).  It would run for awhile but especially on a game (old or new it seems) it would die within 30 minutes.  Without the graphics card and just using the onboard graphics the screen would momentarily tear/scramble but would not BSOD.  I got a replacement Shuttle and so far, after a few hours of game playing, no BSODs, so I am feeling confident enough to write a quick review.<br /><br />Configuration:<br />[[ASIN:B0057Q4ADU Kingston Hyper X Blu 8 GB (2x4GB Modules) 1600MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 XMP Desktop Memory - KHX1600C9D3B1K2/8GX]]<br />[[ASIN:B004EBUXI0 Intel Core i5-2500 3.3 GHz 6 MB Cache Socket LGA1155 Processor]]<br />NVIDIA GeForce 210 (plan to upgrade to a 240 I found on sell elsewhere)<br />[[ASIN:B001GQYYSG Western Digital 500 GB Caviar Black SATA 3 Gb/s 7200 RPM 32 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive - WD5001AALS]]<br />[[ASIN:B003E1Z45S Acer ET.VV3HP.A01 23-Inch Widescreen LCD Monitor (Black)]]<br />[[ASIN:B003N35UBA Acer G185H Ab 18.5-Inch Widescreen LCD Display (Black)]]<br /><br />Windows Experience Index: 7.5 7.6 5.1 5.6 5.9 (expect it to go to 7.5 7.6 6.8 6.8 5.9) with the newer NVIDIA GPU<br /><br />I did upgrade the bios by going to shuttle dot com (know your model number, e.g. SH67H3).<br /><br />I've assembled bare bones systems from Foxconn (which have worked flawlessly so far) and build systems around motherboards from Gigabyte (not flawless, but not too bad).  The Shuttle appealed to me because it was small (and cute, according to my style aware teenage daughter) and had just about everything I wanted (the 2nd PCIe slot I'll use with a QAM cable tuner I have) and should be upgradeable (SATA 6GBps, eSata, USB 3, 4 X DIMMs, I7 CPU, etc.) in the future, if needed.<br /><br />Update 10/17/2017: Upgraded the CPU with a Core i7-3770K (ebay used) which required I first upgrade my bios to version 2 which Shuttle had and clearly explained how to upgrade and which CPUs one could upgrade to. After six years, this little box is still going strong and was a great investment.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun game :) its a hard to obtain points rapidly, as you have to either download more gamed or play the games you have over and over, but its still very fun.
074322454X|4.0|The book itself is absolutely amazing! I read it in a World War II class I had taken a few years back and just had to buy it for my own collection! When I received the \\"brand new\\" book however, there were little tears in the front.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great in every operating system. It is an indispensable tool that I need everyday. I have multiple versions at my fingertips..
B000HAB4KS|3.0|I'd never had a strong motivation to see 'The Matrix', my taste in science fiction (and science in general) tending more towards space and nature than cyberpunk hijinks. But as a college student, last semester my history professor was obsessed with it, comparing it to the allegory of the cave, the scientific revolution, Nietzsche, Baudrillard, etc. Being fascinated by all of said topics, and feeling the need to round out my film knowledge, I rented it on here (for three dollars! thanks amazon!) and was totally underwhelmed. 'The Matrix' reeks of 1999(my childhood), with a typical rebellious young genius not being understood, then being recruited to an underground movement, etc. The main philosophical idea presented is the ancient 'brain-in-a-vat' idea, so what one is left with are action scenes. Not bad ones, but not great ones either. So know what you're getting into; a brightly-lit, late-90s action movie with a well-paced plot nothing more.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Since installing this app on my kindle fire I have been getting the best sleep. I moved away from AZ 3 years ago and the thing I miss most is the monsoon season, now with my sleepy time app I've been able to recreate that atmosphere using (thunderstorm 1)( windchimes 2) and I was even able to add those friendly little (crickets 2) that I became accustomed to back in AZ. By enableling me to recreate this memory and allowing me to fall asleep to such familiar sounds this Sleepy Time app has become the most valuable app in my kindle. All in all if you are looking for an app with the capability of reproducing a familiar and relaxing atmosphere to sleep in then this is your app with 80 plus natural soundtracks you'll be sure to find a combination to suit you...Plus at $1.49 a good night sleep was never so attainable!!! Enjoy this app!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Well acted; scenery amazing.  Great special effects.  Followed book very well.  Well worth seeing again!  An absolute must for Twilight fans of all ages.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I purchased this book based on the high reader ratings it had received but a quarter of the way through the book, I still hadn't figured out where on earth the author was going with this.  There was so much history on the main character with, as yet, no discernible tension or conflict to keep me reading on to the end.    I walked away from the book for several days, bored.  I picked it up again, and a third of the way into the book was still not anymore satifsied enough to keep reading. I again put it aside. How much longer would I have to read about Jun Do's life before the author let me know what needed solving, what the conflict was, why I needed to stay tuned.  After debating with myself, and the fact that I had paid for the book, I picked it up again.  Only then, did it finally get going.  And once it did, it really did!  I loved the story, the ending, the irony, the dark humor.  Just hang in there, is all I can say.
1594744769|5.0|This book was a great story. I couldn't put the book down. It has pictures to help form the story in your imagination as well as a great mysterious adventure that takes place as you read.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone, teens or adults!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly has come a long way from her Idol days. She is a unique talent, versatile and can cross over from country to pop effortlessly. The first video I saw of hers was with Reba McIntire (Because of You. I have always been a fan but because of her fearless political stance I bought three more Stronger CDs for my family members. Stronger runs the gamut from pop to light country. Love it.
B005KJZDW6|5.0|The Albulm just reminds me of home. Family and enjoying what is Christmas. That warm feeling of seeing your cousins and friends in such a loving time of the year. And playing or talking of old and new times while listening to Christmas music. Awesome Albulm. Great shipping. Very Protect. Red Vinyl is so cool! Great Product!
0792163710|5.0|Shane has all the elements of a classic film, not just of the Western genre, but any cinematographic work. From incredible panoramic shots of the American West and a sweeping musical score; to the eternally relevant story of struggle between classes and interests; Shane brings it all to the screen. The total package and predecessor to most of the great westerns we know today, Shane is a memorable movie you'll never forget. Even by today's film standards it's a longer movie, but it keeps pace and the story fits in well to the longer format. If you want to know what kind of film and history inspired the greats like Rio Bravo; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly; High Plains Drifter; and Tombstone, this is a film you need to add to the queue!
B0068TL23G|5.0|I'm really not much of a gamer but like to have a couple to play when I go home, which is out of wi-fi reach.  I always check for the free app of the day for my Kindle Fire, and I was quite pleased to get this one.  It is challenging and fun.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I am totally incompetent when it comes to trying to sharpen a knife using a traditional stone. However, this little gadget seems to be able to help me overcome this personal shortcoming. I've tried this sharpener on a few of my pocket knives and so far it's done a fabulous job. I really like it! My jack knives are now properly sharpened and the process only took a few seconds and was extremely simple. I'm constantly looking for more things to sharpen now.
B000BNI99K|2.0|I used to love Rod Stewart's early solo albums, back in the early seventies. Then about 1980 I discovered the Great American Songbook. I not only love it, but I learned to play and sing it. I think it's wonderful that Rod loves it, too. The songs are terrific. I think it's lovely that millions of people have purchased these CDs and that many have thus learned to love the music that Rod and I love.  But frankly, Rod's performances here are only mediocre. This is largely the fault, I think, of very boring, staid arrangements with endless flowing strings that definitely don't swing. Three and Four are better than One and Two, due to the production by Steve Tyrell. But Steve is a MUCH better singer of these songs than Rod. Buy STEVE's CDs. The second problem is that Rod's \\"interpretation\\" is essentially NO interpretation. These are the straightest versions of these songs since they appeared with orchestras in movies. If you just want the songs, this may be for you. Also, when I listen to these, I keep thinking I'm listening to a woman singing. I have to keep reminding myself that it's a guy singing.  If you want to hear GREAT versions of these songs, listen to Frank Sinatra do them, from the Capital Years on. Buy Ella fitzgerald's   many Songbooks that focus on different great composers. Buy Tony Bennett. Buy Blossom Dearie, who is a revelation. Buy Rosemary Clooney's The Songbook Collection. Buy Stacey Kent, who is also a revelation. Buy June Christy. Then try listening to Rod again. You won' t be impressed, either.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I got this for a blowout price of $27 and could not be happier with my purchase. All three films look great, and what I love more than the picture quality is the audio...The surround sound is REALLY good.
B003Y5H574|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, though it was not what I had expected and I felt the talented Julianne Moore was very underused.  It's a story about relationships in various generations and how they intersect.  I had expected a little more depth from what I saw in the preview, but it was still fun to watch(if only for Ryan Gosling;)
B00164KWUW|5.0|This ending is 100% better than the theatrical version. Definitely worth the money. One of the better movies of this genre. Still leaves an opening for a viable sequel; which personally I would like to see.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a pretty good game. some of it wasn't really that good but it still was a pretty good game.
B0007TKNII|5.0|i was so captivated by this movie as i cryed at such a  love and beautiful music  it left  me breathless to say the least!!!!magnificent bravo!!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Does anyone not like The Lion King? It's a wonderful story, with great music and I have fond memories of watching it countless times growing up, having the good fortune of having younger siblings who happened to love it too, so I spend a good chunk of time over the years watching this and other fabulous Disney films.  Looking back, it feels very wholesome compared to some of the rubbish on TV aimed at children today. So, whether you're nostalgic or looking for something for you kid to watch, this is a good choice.
1936850028|5.0|If you've ever participated in the American Birkebeiner XC Ski Marathon or if you're thinking about doing so, then you will want to read this book. Walter Rhein does a masterful job of reminding us what we've all thought, before, during and after the Birkie. And he does it with humorous anecdotes, poignant recollections and considerable writing skill.
1439102732|3.0|I got this book because Amazon suggested it to me in the recommended reading section. I knew from the start that I was going to get pissed off a lot throughout the book. The story is well written and mirrors reality perfectly. It starts with a married couple, Max and Zoe Baxter, that can't have children and go through an assisted fertility process.  One thing leads to another and they end up getting divorced. Max follows his brother's path and ends up turning into a very insecure man and a religious nutcase. Zoe on the other hand ends up in a lesbian relationship with quite an insecure and controlling woman (although she doesn't appear to be one, she is). She ends up rubbing her new relationship into her ex-husband's face, to please Vanessa, her girlfriend, and when she wants a batch of frozen embryos left from their marriage things get pretty ugly.<br /><br />They end up in an exhausting trial, and of course Max has a bunch of religious zealots backing him up, including his brother and sister in law, and his lawyers, who by the way are really obnoxious. They use God in court as if he even wrote the constitution, which was pretty absurd, but with some people that is the only law they follow and the only law that they tailor to suit their needs. Surely it is better to leave God out of some arguments and find strong human reasons for supporting the systems and beliefs we advocate, which doesn't happen in this court at all.  The outcome is quite surprising, but be ready for a rough patch along the way. However the plot is quite entertaining and gives you a lot to think about.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is fun and competitive and the best part about it is that every game the board changes so no one person dominates everyone else. It requires you to think ahead and plan if you want to win (although any game with dice also requires a little bit of luck). It's an addicting game
B000F3UAFC|3.0|The acting, by the women, was rather bad though.  I've never been a fan of Johansson or Hunt, but both were quite miscast, I think. At least Helen Hunt as the seductress or woman of mystery, should have been a little more charismatic, but I felt like she was simply reading lines with minor inflection(the minimal with which, frankly, Johansson couldn't seem to be bothered). Fortunately, Tom Wilkinson could be relied upon to make the most of his, sadly smallish, part.  I will give the film three stars nonetheless, as I like the story, setting, and costumes, and the male actors(sounds very sexist, but I'm a woman which makes it doubly hard to admit Hunt and Johansson's failings;)  To be fair, I have seen her give a much more spirited performance in 'Vicki Christina Barcelona', maybe this just wasn't the right part for her.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|Some people talk about LDR as though she's the salvation of pop music, while others deride her as \\"manufactured\\" or even \\"fake.\\" I'll offer a more balanced review -- I think she is a talented young woman who is off to a good start, who has a good voice and an intriguing style and presentation. I happen to think \\"Video Games\\" is an incredible pop song, and others such as \\"Born to Die,\\" \\"Blue Jeans,\\" and \\"Dark Paradise\\" are also pretty good -- sultry and mesmerizing. Some songs sound overproduced to me, such as \\"National Anthem\\" and \\"Off to the Races.\\" She has made some good choices and also some mistakes, as anyone starting out will. I think it will be interesting to see how her career unfolds.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have not been able to play pvz since upgrading to Ice cream sandwich on my Xoom. This need to be addressed asap.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|works great on my kindle fire...no problems at all. I play it very frequently and I love it! highly recommend for the uno card lover.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|I will start out by saying none of the actors here were favorites of mine, but, having seen the film, I am quite impressed with all of them.  It's a short film based on a play, and it is definitely worth seeing. The couples are both excellent, the writing sharp, and the story entertaining without being much of anything really.  It's simply two couples brought together because of their children and trying to be civilized...
B00425S1H8|4.0|Unit works fine after I had a few problems. I had to make sure that the Microsot Drivers did not get loaded. You must stop the MS search for drivers and force it to manually search your computer and make windows search whatever directory you set up with the plugable drivers. I could not get this to work until I forced windows to load the plugable drivers
B001NB545Q|1.0|Recently I tried to purchase an album from the MP3 downloads. The album did not download and automatically sent it to a cloud that I never set up or requested. After calling the second person I spoke with was very difficult to understand and I had to ask her to speak more slowly. The entire experience took 40 minutes to download 1 album. Amazon should simplify this process if they expect repeat business from me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|What really appealed to me is getting to my data from any device. While editing is easiest from the PC, reading and check list are great on kindle fire. Still learning festures, like what I see.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I want to love this, but I have a couple of gripes:  1. I hate that Amazon limits how many products I can see, but then doesn't give me a whole lot of options to narrow my search. Unless I'm looking for a specific product, I find myself launching the full website in my browser--not ideal on the phone and the mobile site is just slightly better than the app.  2. I am currently building a baby registry. I am shocked that I can't add items to it, that I'm limited to only adding things to my wish list.  Make these two changes and I may change my rating.
0142418471|5.0|How do I explain how much I loved this book? It was laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, sad, and ultimately uplifting. I have a feeling that the authors wouldn't really like the \\"uplifting\\" part of that sentence, but I had to say it.  Will Grayson #1 had me laughing right off the bat. The whole \\"you can pick your friends, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose\\" thing was hysterical. And I liked how that was a recurring theme through the book.  I wanted to bring Will Grayson #2 home with me and keep him safe and warm and happy. Luckily for all of use Tiny Cooper and WG1 sort of took care of that.  Oh, Tiny Cooper. I want a Tiny Cooper in my life. He struck me as the kind of kid who figured that, given his life circumstances, he could be miserable, or he could embrace who and what he was and run with it. Thankfully, he chose the latter. I really want to see his musical. :)  This book is definitely for the older YA audience. The characters are 16-17, and that's the age I would recommend for the reader, as this book deals with some mature issues, and the language is rather raw at times.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This game was awesome!  Couldn't put it down.  Wish there were more games like this!  Finding the objects &amp;solving the crime was fun!
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|Lana Del Rey went viral seemingly overnight last summer with her \\"Video Games\\" video clip, subsequently followed by the \\"Blue Jeans\\" clip, and from pretty much out of nowhere in a matter of 6 months, she played at Saturday Night Live recently. There has been discussion whether Lana's rapid rise has or hasn't been carefully orchestrated by her label Interscope, but now that the album is finally out, let's put aside all hype and suspiscion, and focus on the music.<br /><br />\\"Born To Die\\" (12 tracks; 50 min.) can be divided in 3 sections. The first 4 tracks are slow-burners, pretty much in the vein of \\"Video Games\\" but check out in particular \\"Off To the Races\\", an album highlight. The middle section of the album (tracks 5 though 8) brings slightly faster tracks, and shines thoughout. \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" is delightful, with playful lyrics like \\"Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City/Can we hit it low now down and gritty\\". Likewise with \\"National Anthem\\" (not to be confused with Radiohead's \\"The National Anthem\\"). After a brooding \\"Dark Paradise\\" (see my review title), comes \\"Radio\\", by far the most readily accessible track on this album (chorus: \\"Now my life is a sweet cinnamon/like a f**king dream I'm living in\\"). The last third album slows back down, and contains several other highlights such as \\"Million Dollar Man\\" (which reminds me of early Fiona Apple, think Never Is a Promise/The Child Is Gone/Pale September). The album ends appropriately with the self -explaining \\"This Is What Makes Us Girls\\".<br /><br />In all, this is quite the album. Mostly dark, brooding, biting, yet funny and playful at times. Definitely not for anyone in a hurry. I can't imagine this album will be a mainstream success (this is MILES away from Adele's \\"21\\"), but I could be wrong and I hope I am. Much has been made of Lana's maligned SNL appearance (which was really not all that bad), and I personally can't wait to see her bringing these songs in concert. This album proves that Lana is the real deal, period, forget all the hype and everything else. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />*UPDATE* (June, 2012) I saw Lana Del Rey in concert this past weekend at the Irving Plaza in NY, and what a show that was. Forget about the \\"deer in headlights\\" SNL perfomance. She put on a thrilling 50 min. set focusing on the \\"jazz-lounge\\" tracks from the album (with a live band consisting of piano, 3 violinists and a guitar). Lana was confident and in control throughout the show, which was a sing-along for most of the crowd. Great show all around, although I hope she will expand her live shows to a bigger band so that she can bring \\"trip-hop\\" songs like \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\", \\"Radio\\" and \\"Off To the Races\\" live. But if you can catch her live, don't miss it!al deal, period, forget all the hype and everything else.

B006P0FICE|1.0|I realized going in that this would be very different from Alexander Dumas' masterpiece, but I just couldn't get past how terribly all the characters were portrayed.  None of the main characters are gentlemen, the king is weak and good for nothing, and Milady uses strength and martial arts, rather than seduction.  The motives for almost every character are also completely off.  The romance and honor are both absent in this film.  Normally I can tolerate movie adaptations of books that I enjoy, but this movie was just terrible.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|This movie, to me, is a classic to my collection after a single watch. Some would disagree, and others would call me crazy. But personally I gained a deep feeling from this film. Perhaps I look to deeply into it, and see a deeper message then is portrayed. But it has Emily Browning in it, and I would not be surprised if I married her someday.  The movie itself has a strong influence of music, some sang by Emily Browning herself, that add a nice feel to the movie when used right. The action scenes are the only real lacking area of this film to me. They all feel like they were more focus on making the scenes look really cool, and less action packed. One scene including a train I really felt they took the slow motion fighting too far. Well visually appealing, it doesn't deliver the action feel that five girls armed with guns, swords, and knives should. Which is what keeps this movie from a five star rating in this review. Outside the action scenes though is where I enjoyed myself the most, and where the story really takes place.  I really enjoyed the opening too. Emily Browning sings \\"Sweet Dreams (are made of these)\\" which plays during it, and it really tells a tale in a pleasing way.  So, would I recommend this film? If you can over analysis a film like I can, then there is a good chance you will. If you are fascinated by the mind, and the potential it has, give it a watch. If your a pure action junkie, skip it and go onto the next.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />I come to this album as one who knows little about Leonard Cohen and his music.  I've admired both the Jeff Buckley and Brandi Carlile covers of \\"Hallelujah,\\" and I remember liking the Concrete Blonde cover of \\"Everybody Knows\\" when it appeared on the PUMP UP THE VOLUME soundtrack.  I know Cohen is Canadian and that he is considered to be one of the greatest and most influential singer-songwriters of our time.  Despite the countless times I've read his name when reading about music over the years, I just never got around to him.  Some of you may consider this an unforgivable admission of musical ignorance, while other Cohen newbies like me can take solace in the knowledge that they are not alone.<br /><br />And now I see Leonard Cohen, seventy-seven years old, sitting in a black suit, black hat, and black sunglasses on his enigmatic, black-shadowed album cover at the top of the Amazon sales charts and I can't help but think \\"it must be time for me to get around to Leonard Cohen...\\"<br /><br />Hearing OLD IDEAS has taught me that popping my Cohen cherry so relatively late in my musical fandom is both a blessing and a curse.  A blessing because apparently I have now just skimmed the surface of a true treasure trove that I can savor digging into deeply for the first time.  A curse because these are treasures that could have been with me all along.  I have been missing out until now but it is time to make up for lost time with Leonard.<br /><br />I imagine true fans of the man will already know all about this album.  They will already know that this is another great one and that it's worth the time they will put into it.  Casuals and newbies who are wondering about what the true fans already know can know the following now:<br /><br />This is a musical album of uncommonly unaffected poetry and grace, encompassing a variety of musical styles, and delivered in a gravelly speak-sing baritone.  A rich combination to be sure, and it all goes down like an acquired taste - whiskey, or coffee, or...caviar.<br /><br />At first listen the most immediately accessible songs seem to be both the first (\\"Going Home\\") and the last (\\"Different Sides\\"), and over the course of the eight tracks in between Cohen confidently plays the game of \\"Operation\\" on the body of the human condition.<br /><br />If you're wavering at all on this purchase, ask yourself if you're the kind of person who might enjoy an album that opens with the singer talking about himself in the third person:<br /><br />\\"I love to speak with Leonard, he's a sportsman and a shepherd, he's a lazy b _ s t _ _ d living in a suit...\\"<br /><br />Basically, this is music for smart people.  And if you're still reading this then either you're already a smart person, or, after hearing this album (like me) you'll be that much closer to becoming one...<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listenere, or...caviar.  At first listen the most immediately accessible songs seem to be both the first (\\"Going Home\\") and the last (\\"Different Sides\\"), and over the course of the eight tracks in between Cohen confidently plays the game of \\"Operation\\" on the body of the human condition.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This movie is spellbinding, and is something you have to see a few tines before you can appreciate its beauty and story at every level. Its complex; possibly the most cinematically beautiful film ive ever seen. See it. Its worth it.
B0045EJY90|3.0|While the CD-P650 has good resolution, the sound is very forward or loud in the upper midrange and lower treble. Some people will hear this as harshness but its not. That's because the high treble is very rolled off and this has the effect of rounding off the leading edges of notes. Also, because the upper midrange is so strong the lower midrange obviously sounds too weak. This leads to a lack of richness, and a sort of hollow sound. It's not that bad, just not very accurate.

I usually wouldn't choose this type of book but I'm trying to be open to new things, plus I liked the movie 'The Notebook' so I thought it might be tolerable.<br />The beginning reminded me of The Notebook; girl from a well-to-do family falls for a boy from a completely opposite family and of course her parents do not approve and do everything to break up the relationship. I was irritated by the similarities. But, the book adds many different twists and turns and for me it turned into a dramatic and very predictable soap opera. I read it as quickly as I could just so I could be finished with it.<br />Long story short, I wouldn't recommend this book.

B0068TL23G|3.0|I really like this game, but there are a couple issues that need fixing..  1, pressing back should jump out of puzzle, not ask to exit. 2, when you replay a puzzle its stars and score are cleared!  that needs to be saved, only alter score if a better score is reached.  3, the option to not jump puzzles doesnt work, I unchecked it, complete a puzzle but want to replay but it still automatically goes to the next puzzle.  4, if you're playing to unlock the next set of puzzles, and reach the last puzzle on that board but haven't reached the min score to unlock the next board.. once you reopen a level you scored less on, that boards score is removed from your total as I mentioned, and if you complete it, it automatically opens the next puzzle and wipes its score out as well!!!  terrible combination of bugs.  once fixed consider it 5 stars.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|This band is rising fast!... Every few years a band comes along that changes the alternative music scene, and becomes an inspiration for many new bands to come...  I think AWOLnation may be one of those bands...  AWOLnation has a truly original sound and unique voice in Aaron Bruno (signer / lead songwriter) His vocal skills are eminent and range a variety of genres... he can sing catchy melodies, break out into staccato vocal beats, rise to epic emotional rock screams, drop back into a rap line, and then into a multi piece gospel harmony with backup vocals and instruments... and often, all these vocal styles in a single song.  The result is a great variety and range of pace and emotion.  The rest of the band is very good as well.. including Blind Melon guitarist Chris Thorn... and even though the music is heavily Pro-Tools produced, AWOLnation manages to pull off really great live performances.. (check out YouTube for various live tracks) .... the true test of their musicianship.  In addition to nailing the cross pollination of several genres, writing catchy melodies, and having great production values, I will also say that this band does a great job of writing songs that \\"breathe\\" well... they deftly allow space in between beats and melodies to give the downbeats and changes a great effect.  Translation:  They get your head bobbing!  The entire album is very good... I've listened through it several dozen times now.  It's well worth the purchase.  FIRST LISTEN HITS:  -> \\"SAIL\\" (5/5 stars)  Their first single / radio hit... a dark sounding song combining  ripping electronic synth bass, staccato string chops, catchy guitar arpeggios, and a combination of great vocal melodies and heavy angst filled vocals.  This was the song that convinced me to buy the album in the first place... probably like most.  -> \\"GUILTY FILTHY SOUL\\" (5/5 stars)  I loved this song as soon as I heard it... opening with a catchy guitar riff that breaks down into a killer beat.  Great vocals andvocal variation.  Great melodies, interesting lyrics, catchy electronic synth piano, and production effects.  I'd say this is the best track on the album.  iTunes says I've listened to it 37 times.  -> \\"NOT YOUR FAULT\\" (5/5 stars)  Their latest single / radio hit... Features a great combo of synth keyboard and bass parts, with a variety of genres.  Great vocal performance with heavy angst filled chorus and catchy melodic verses.  Its a fun, dancey song.  Great recording/production.  THE NEXT SONGS THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION  These songs caught my interest and replay buttons after the second or third listen through.  -> \\"KNIGHTS OF SHAME\\" (5/5 stars)  It's not often that a 10+ minute song is even attempted by bands these days... indeed, anything longer than 5 minutes is rare... it goes against commercial recommendations of the labels, and basically guarantees no radio play... which is too bad, but thats for another discussion.  Knights of Shame is an epic song that goes through many great sections.  This song showcases the huge variety of sound that AWOLnation is able to produce.  Electronica, Pop, Cartoon Indie, Drum and Bass, Rap, Funk, Gorillaz-esque Hip-Hop, Rock, Space Synth... this song has a little bit of everything... and its doesn't feel gimmicky... its solid all the way through 12 min.  -> \\"JUMP ON MY SHOULDERS\\" (4/5 stars)  More great combination of shakin' beats with electronica synth and a variety of vocals.  -> \\"WAKE UP\\" (4/5 stars)  A combination of heavy beats that will shake your body and melodic Jamiroquai-esque breakdowns.  The rest of the tracks are very good as well (3/5) to (4/5) tracks.  My recommendation: get this album.  I appreciate it as a fan of a many genres of music, and as a musician myself.  AWOLnation is currently touring.  I'm hoping their sophomore album will be as inspired as this one is, and not be too far off in the future.

B005UBNL0A|2.0|Abysmal performance for a 3.6 ghz \\"quad core\\", newer architecture, and generous caches.  This is for a number of reasons (some which are not AMD/CPU issues, per se) Be advised that this is *not* a genuine quad core CPU (it has two *non-independent* cores) and Windows does not fully support this CPU yet!  However, note that the FX 4100 dominates cost to performance ratios versus Intel - the only selling point.<br /><br />The \\"quad core\\" advertising is grossly misleading.  The FX 4100 operates the cores differently than its predecessors to obtain \\"quad core\\" performance effects.  Unfortunately, that doesn't change the fact it really is only two effective cores and the four core operation must share CPU resources.  Worse, Windows does not properly support the FX's new methods of operation!  A new patch is due 2012 Q1 to Windows to rectify the performance issues.  I won't explain here but further reading:  articles regarding MS KB2592546<br /><br />AMD FX 4100 WEI of only 7.2 - my prior AMD 840 managed 7.4 with an inferior system.  The Windows Rating is normally to be taken with a grain of salt except hardware review benchmarks have come to similar (relative) conclusions.  Real life usage of this CPU also shows a performance hit.<br /><br />This CPU is excellent \\"bang for your buck\\" but there are serious issues at play:<br />1. Highly misleading advertising with the quad core.  This is a dual core that (with unsupported tech) operating as a quad core.<br />2. Microsoft will not fully support this CPU until 2012 Q1.  AMD has liaisons with Microsoft & this should have been coordinated prior to release.<br />3. The two cores on this CPU do not perform that well. Again, cost-to-performance considerations are the only thing that make it worthwhile.<br /><br />This CPU is fine if you're upgrading from a dated AMD system.

0143119680|2.0|\\"A Discovery of Witches\\" has so much potential to be more than what ended up published. I love/d the idea: witches, vampires, magic, nerdiness, some magical action, and an emerging problem that unfolds. I was not expecting a romance. I figured that the characters might fall in love, which was fine, but the book was written in a way that it was just a romance that concerned two characters, more than someone was being forced to come to terms with her magic. Yes, this was an issue in the story, but this conflict of magic sat second to the \\"romance\\" that unfolded between Diana and her vampire, Matthew.  The two main characters of the book, Diana and Matthew, I found irritating. The only characters I might say that I really \\"like\\" would be Sarah and Em -- members of Diana's family. Why? What could be wrong with the main witch and vampire? Well, if you can get beyond the fact that the relationship dynamic between Matthew and Diana, it is hard to believe that Matthew is a vampire. I love brooding vampires, I don't necessarily feel that vampires should be all evil... I LOVE/d the earlier Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice... it's just that Matthew seems like he's just a guy who happens to be a vampire. The only thing he has that's weird about him is this \\"protective instinct\\"... which is supposed to excuse the completely unhealthy, weak relationship that exists between him and Diana. The other Vampires suffer a similar problem -- they're too bland, almost human, and there does not seem to be any real... threat to them, other than you're being told that they're dangerous. The only vampire who was written well would be Miriam. She was dark, threatening and yet still able to get beyond whatever issues she had to be on Diana's side.  Diana is just an idiot. For someone who is written as strong and brave, her actions come from dependence more than anything. I really wanted to like her, and I hope that maybe as this story grows, and Diana accepts her magic, that she will... in turn,grow into a strong, self-sustaining individual. Her magic and her character development is too dependent upon her love for Matthew, and it makes the book predictable. What about Diana doing something for herself? But maybe that will come.  As for the book itself, not enough attention was given to what I think really mattered -- Ashmole 782, why not take the readers on a path to learn about this book/experiences? -- there were plenty of opportunities for magic to happen to give a creative, unique reading experience. Diana's kidnapping could have been so much more! -- give more space to that traumatizing incident... and good heavens, give space to this woman dealing with the trauma and her magic vs. saying that she's scared but oh! matthew and diana spend a lot of time groping each other out by the apple tree! The letter from her parents could have been so much more magical and creative. Instead you read about such mundane things, and then this romance and then... nothing at all, that the book just lost its charm and appeal. I really wanted the book to do better and to like this book.  Other reviewers are right about things -- it's a creative story, there exists a lot of potential, this is more romance than excitement, too much space is given to the mundane (descriptions of wine, activities, looks, smells-- repeatedly), the plot unfolds through conversation, Diana is kind of an idiot for someone who is so seemingly educated, the vampires did not really have any teeth -- the only one who sort of did was Miriam, the witches house towards the end was the most entertaining part of the novel. One of the many thoughts that I had while reading this novel was that this book lends itself to the movie screen. It's written with description and dialogue and that's it. The writing itself is good, but the general construction of the novel gave a more cinematic experience than a pleasant reading experience. The plot unfolds through conversations, rather than detail to story and events, and this is something that movies more than books benefit from in storytelling.  I am usually not a \\"middle of the road\\" type of ranker, but I really would have preferred to give the book 2.5 stars. Due to the fact that Deborah Harkness could construct sentences and had good syntax (unlike that of Stephanie Meyer), I gave her the 3rd star. The writing itself is not bad. I also have hopes that this romance between Diana and Matthew will take a backseat as this supposed threat unfolds. I do hope for a better 2 and 3 book.  **Addendum**  I had to demote my ranking to two stars. This book continues to annoy me and I think is grossly over-ranked on this site.

B0011ZNAIC|5.0|I was reluctant to watch \\"Bee Movie\\" because of some lukewarm reviews. That'll teach me to trust some critics' opinions! It was very funny (Seinfeld's humor comes shining through) and poignantly relevant, since the world's bee population has been dropping at an alarming rate, blamed on everything from dramatically increased communication signals to widespread use of certain pesticides. Of course, the premise in this movie is a little different (hysterically so!) but the message is the same. What if the honeybee ceased to be part of the web of life?  Astute direction, wonderful animation, hilarious gags and a variety of celebrity voices keep this film buzzing along.

B00575MDL2|5.0|This is an excellent disc which brings together some of the fabulous instrumental movements from Bach's cantatas - many of them sinfonias from which the disc takes its title. There are well over 200 cantatas and many are not performed or broadcast all that often, so much of the music here doesn't get the attention it deserves and I'm delighted that this disc has made it more accessible.<br /><br />The music itself is top-quality Bach, which means it is simply wonderful. It is varied from the quietly beautiful to the joyfully celebratory with a sense of dance never far away. As you would expect of Bach, quite a lot of it is recycled and re-orchestrated from his other works so some familiar tunes pop up in unfamiliar guises. For example, the disc opens with the Sinfonia from BWV 26, an amazing orchestration of the delightful Preludio from the E major solo Violin Sonata and later from BWV174 we get the first movement of Brandenburg Concerto No.3, richly embellished with brass and winds. Other old favourites crop up throughout the disc. The whole thing is a delight and the variety and intelligent programming means that you can play the disc from start to finish without it ever feeling same-y or too much of a good thing as sometimes happens with compilations like this.<br /><br />Accademia Bizantina are terrific. They give the music exactly the right degree of bounce and zing where needed and real delicacy and spirituality in the more meditative movements. It's exemplary Bach playing and the recorded sound captures it excellently.<br /><br />In short, this is a cracking disc, and very warmly recommended.

Soooo romantic, except for real women in real world (like my ex-wife), she doesn't have the pile of money and she leaves two kids behind .. and guess what ? her beautiful trip to a better self ended in being miserable and not finding neither romance, nor spiritual peace, nor love.. just a lonely life and two poor kids shaken by their mom's departures.

B0067LY4WG|5.0|This is a truly great Leonard Cohen album in my view - something I've not been able to say for too many years. The music often sounds delicate but has a laid back robustness about it, too, with his trademark simple melodies and a very welcome varied sound and style, with elements of country, blues, gospel and rock. There are also the beautiful and familiar female backing vocals, and some simply magnificent work from a varied band - the trumpet on \\"Amen,\\" for example, is unexpected and absolutely spellbinding.<br /><br />Cohen's voice these days has passed through the Whisky & Cigarettes stage and is well on the way to a Chronic Bronchitis sound, but he still has that fabulous depth and resonance beneath the weariness and the creaks. He hovers between singing and speaking for much of this album even more than previously, but as a friend once said to me, \\"No one can sing a Leonard Cohen song the way Cohen himself can't.\\" How true. He is miked very close so, particularly when listening on headphones, it really feels as though he is present and whispering into your ear.<br /><br />All this is perfect for the songs here, whose lyrics are Cohen at his best: thoughtful, allusive, melancholy, witty and sometimes provoking. The religious imagery he has always used so brilliantly is well in evidence, and it is striking how much of it is now specifically Christian. Broken relationships, suffering and death have always been in the corner of Cohen's eye whatever he is writing about. They are often in plain sight here and are treated with insight, resignation, compassion and beauty. The old witty twinkle and his self-deprecatory streak are still there, though, and shine through what is often a very elegiac atmosphere. He still has that fantastic ability somehow to get to the heart of things both when he's speaking straightforwardly and even when direct meaning is elusive. These are songs to take into your heart, nurture and allow to grow there.<br /><br />I think that several of these songs, including Amen, Show Me The Place and Different Sides are likely to become Cohen classics, but there is nothing to be sanitized and exploited by talent-show winners here and if you don't like Leonard Cohen this album certainly won't convert you. However, those legions of us who know that he was born like this, he had no choice, he was born with the gift of a golden voice will be delighted and deeply satisfied that that voice, both in what he writes and how he performs it, has lost none of its magnificent lustre.<br /><br />I recommend his album wholeheartedly.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the rare instances I'm glad I caved into the hype and read the Hunger Games trilogy. The second book of the series was an engaging page-turner that I couldn't set down!

B003L20ICE|1.0|Take what I'm about to write with a grain of salt, because my friends and I shut it off with 45 minutes left to play.<br /><br />Nic - I didn't buy her \\"alcoholism\\" one bit.  I have known alcoholics.  she was not one, nor did she portray one to any extent that would make it any problem!  Her reactions to the things happening around her are perfectly justified, especially the whole motorcycle incident.<br /><br />Jules - Do I really even need to comment on this one?  I think the thing that pissed me off most about her wasn't her cheating on her partner of 10 years, it was her being mad at her partner for taking a call from a pregnant patient while she was supposed to be in a bath.  really Jules?  upset because your doctor girlfriend is fulfilling her hippocratic oath?  you're a tool.  And the fact that this character doesn't support Nic when she's trying to maintain being an actual PARENT to the kids is disgusting.<br /><br />Paul - You're falling in love with Jules why?  perhaps the screenwriter can write a more convincing reason why two people would fall in love, other than being around each other for more than a couple weeks.  Could Mark Ruffalo please also take acting lessons to try and develop a different character than the oaf-ish can't express himself type of dufus dude?  please?  I can't take seeing him act the same character in every movie!<br /><br />Joni - the only likeable character.<br />Laser - wow.  what a badly acted stereotypical 15 year old.  come on!  He finds no real purpose in the movie, or any driving character development, other than realizing his best buddy is a jerk.<br /><br />Tanya - Sorry honey.  I can't get past the fact you were in America's Next Top Model.  All I see is you posing in the last ep of that ANTM season on a rock telling the camera that you're imagining poetry and beautiful things.  lol.<br /><br />And overall, the one thing I hate most about this movie is all the blame being pushed onto Paul.  It's what I call the Jerry Springer effect, where the blame gets placed on the \\"interloper\\", instead of on the people who made a commitment to each other.  I hate that.  I don't like most of the characters in this movie.  I have zero empathy for them.  No need to watch this.

1594202842|3.0|I give 3 stars for honesty.  I also found it invaluable as to what I should never do to my children. For that I thank her.  I am Asian and my parents were both educators, but we never had to endure anything close to the cruelty she unleashed on her children.  Sure my parents had high expectations, but they never forced anything.  They guided and supported unconditionally.  My siblings and I did fine in the end without all the crazy pressures and threats.  I think Amy in many cases is confusing her controlling nature (possibly OCD) as Asian way of parenting.  I think she has some problems to resolve herself, perhaps with the help of a professional.  Meanwhile Jed sounds spineless.  In the meantime, I feel sorry for LuLu.  When all said and done, she will have had a horrible childhood, and she will spend many years resolving the inner conflicts that built up at such early and impressionable age.  Another question I had was whether it's beneficial to practice so much when their hands are still developing and I am sure fragile.  I heard that many prodigies incur injuries and then are left unable to play the instrument properly.  Just pain and suffering (usually arthritis) remains for them in that case.  Lastly, she says that Asian way is to keep all things within the family. If so, why did she write this book?  How does this help the kids?  If my parents ever wrote a book like this about us, I would not have been happy.  All in very contradictory to what she says and selfserving -- but then again, it's par for the course.  She think's she's doing all this for the kids, but much is about herself and issues.

1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs was an important tech leader in the current age.  Walter Isaacson writes a balanced biography using unprecedented access to Jobs. What a combination!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Steve Jobs, Pixar, Apple and get a glimpse of why the company makes great products.  I admire Jobs for his achievements, but not for his character.  The Steve Jobs portrayed here is admirable for the great feats performed by his companies, Apple and Pixar; but was very unappealing as a person and how he treated others.  Steve Jobs is a complex person: intensely selfish, childish, demanding, tech consumer product visionary, genius, and generator of reality distortion fields.  I think too many people made excuses for Job's poor behavior because of his achievements.  Jobs showed unrivaled capacity to tightly integrate hardware and software to create intuitive, easy to use products.  Steve showed everyone the benefits of a closed system of technology.  The high points of Jobs' management style: hire the best people and don't tolerate below-par performance.

But as the suicide scene went on, we both agreed that it was from Vertigo. I don't have a copy of the CD, but I wonder if it's credited in the booklet. It certainly should be! It was bit distracting once we realized the source, but it also added another layer of sadness to the scene. So in the end, it was a successful use of Hermann's music in a beutifully shot, acted, and directed film.

B0053JJLLC|3.0|This book is a good way to pass a rainy afternoon, but it's far from great.  I'm glad I decided to get it from the library instead of buying it after reading the reviews here.  I don't mind the shallow, archetypal characters that some other reviewers mentioned, that's a pretty standard feature throughout Crichton's books.  Crichton's focus was never on character development but on plot - unfortunately the plot in this book was pretty weak.  Honey, I shrunk the grad students and then lost them (on purpose) in the jungles of Hawaii - instead of just stepping on them as soon as they were shrunk, then washing their tiny little bodies down a garbage disposal.  The body count is higher among the protagonists than in a lot of Crichton's books, which I also really didn't like, it felt almost like a sciencey Dean Koontz book in places.  The \\"technology\\" that allows Nanigen to shrink things is not nearly as impressive as the technology used in Timeline to travel between parallel worlds, and the time spent discussing the technology was all of a paragraph or two.  I'm not sure if Crichton just hadn't fleshed out enough for Preston to work with there or what, but it was definitely a disappointment.  Most of the research was evident in the extremely detailed descriptions of the appearance and behavior of the fauna and flora at the micro level, which was interesting to a point (I'll probably never look at ants the same way again), but it wasn't particularly fascinating.  Overall the book didn't really give me the same sense of wonder and \\"oh wow, what if..\\" that Crichton's other, better-executed books give.

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, don't be fooled by the title. This is not an innocent, family movie by no means. American movie theater patrons had never seen a movie so violent. The story content and the way it was filmed would change Hollywood movies forever.<br /><br /> The Godfather is based on the life of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He has a large family in New York. This is the day of his daughter's wedding. Men that Mr. Corleone has been friends with are now coming to him for the help they need. He is a powerful man in New York. He is respectfully called \\"Godfather\\". One man tells Godfather, in his darkened office, that his daughter was raped. In order for Godfather to take care of the matter, you will be asked to do a job for him someday.<br />  Johnny Faontane (Al Martino) wants a part in a movie. The director, Jack Woltz, (John Marley) doesn't want him for the role. So The Godfather sends his private lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert DuVall) to California to talk to the director. As a friend, give The Godfather what he wants. The director refuses to put Johnny in his movie. Hagen says Mr. Corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately.

His father was killed for making an insult to the mafia chieftain in Sicily. Over the course of the movie, we will see how the adult Vito (Robert DeNiro) became the powerful Godfather.<br /> Back to 1958, Michael (Al Pacino) now lives in Lake Tahoe and owns and controls two major hotels. He intends of acquiring four more hotels against the dislike of Senator Geary (G.D. Spradlin) who does not like the Corleone family in Nevada.

B004RJMUJO|2.0|I went and truer out the free version and liked it. Then I got the paid version and relized that the free version was way better. The game its self is ok, but why would you pay for something, when you could get the exact thing better and free?
B005I6EU48|5.0|No issues with overly tight elastic, it is as it should be to keep the device secure.  The cover closes perfectly well after it sits for a bit, or if you simply rest it face down for a while, that speeds up the pliability.  Very attractive cover, offering casual elegance to the Fire.
1400052181|5.0|I found The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks to be a fascinating science non-fiction book. I can't help but be reminded of a science based fiction book I recently read entitled, FOREVER and EVER by Dan A. Baker, which is all about gene-based aging reversal and immortality.  In Rebecca Skloot's story, the doctors launched a medical revolution from Henrietta Lacks cells that never died.  In Dan Baker's fiction story, the doctors worked on gene-based aging reversal that could become reality in the near future.  Both stories detour through ethics, scientific potential, and global impact. I highly recommend Rebecca Skloot's non-fiction book to all science based non-fiction and fiction readers, as her story is written like a novel with the facts within.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this album. Too often when a famous band becomes no more, the individual members put out music that makes you think they are basically trading on their name and reputation. One might expect an album of pleasant but uninspired music, with the odd Pink Floyd-style hook to remind you of who you are listening to.  Wrong.  I was amazed by how fresh this music sounds. This does not sound like an album by someone on the verge of retirement. It's like listening to a Pink Floyd album - and yet it's not. There is certainly none of the arty sound effects that were found on PF albums even right up to and including Wish You Were Here; this is just music, but music with the kind of bite that you don't expect from someone at this stage of his career.  In some ways this album feels a little like The Division Bell Part 2. Like most of Pink Floyd's work, the melodies are simple, but by no means banal, and executed with enough soul and passion to put this album firmly in the genre of melodic progressive rock. There really isn't much point in describing the album track by track; if you liked albums like Wish You Were Here, A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell, you will enjoy this.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I am impressed with this book! The premise rings true with me: Let's stop focusing on what's wrong with us and begin focusing on discovering, developing and enjoying our natural gifts, talents and strengths. This book can literally be your \\"strengths finder.\\"<br /><br />Again, another one of these books I've had on my shelf for awhile that I've been meaning to read. I'm extremely glad I took the time to \\"get around to it.\\" Strengths Finder 2.0 by Tom Rath and published by Gallup Press is a gem for anyone interested in personal and professional development.<br /><br />Strengths Finders 2.0 isn't just about finding your own strengths, but also about acknowledging and verifying the strengths of others. I believe it is a great book for managers, supervisors, bosses and leaders to recommend to their employees and teams. It will also make a great Book Club selection for your Mastermind group or for network marketing team meetings.<br /><br />This book is based on the work of Don Clifton who is widely considered the Father of Strengths Psychology. The Gallup scientists have worked with thousands of people to determine the importance of discovering and nurturing our natural gifts and talents. Their research shows that the most successful people start with a dominant talent and then add skills, knowledge and consistent practice so they can fully build a powerful and rewarding \\"strength.\\"<br /><br />When you purchase this book, you receive a packet including an access code to the Strengths Finder 2.0 assessment program located on their website. For me, the assessment quiz is worth buying the book. You take the quiz and immediately get your results. The book, assessment and website all work together so you have an opportunity to particpate in the activities and develop a workable plan of action for finding and enjoying your strengths.<br /><br />Strengths Finder 2.0 by Tom Rath also includes 34 Strengths Themes and Ideas for Action - again worth the purchase of the book.<br /><br />This quote from the book rang so true for me: \\"Far too many people spend a lifetime headed in the wrong direction.\\" I highly recommend this book.many people spend a lifetime headed in the wrong direction.\\" I highly recommend this book.
B004I744AS|5.0|is a good app if you have wifi. no Internet connection will leave you strandered. however with Internet its Gerry convient, and such a lifesaver.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is an addiction to play each and everyday.  It is very fun to play. the only reason I don't give this app five stars is because when you ask for hints they give you hints that will lower your score. Other than that this amazing to play and is awesome!!!!!!!!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I found this to be one of the best books I've read so far. I was a bit concerned at first, because of a few bad reviews, but it far exceeded my expectations.  It doesn't live up to the author's claim that 'it will make you believe in God', but it definitely engages your thought process. It's the kind of book that deserves a second read, which I rarely do.  Kudos to the author, and I'm looking forward to reading more from him.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This book is extremely depressing and I am not in the mood to even finish it. I can say with honesty that it is really well written and it tugs on the heart strings, the only problem is that it makes me feel like there is no hope. If I wanted to be depressed I just have to go out and talk with people.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I wasn't overly impressed with this book although I couldn't point to a specific fault in it. The story was good, the characters well developed and with good prose. It has all the makings of a great novel but lacks that final touch that will make it shine above the rest. Somehow it failed to fully satisfy me and I was left wanting more.  I'm giving 5 stars because, like I said before, I couldn't really find a fault in it and it's probably an issue of personal preference rather than a shortcoming from the author.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|One of the great music experiences ever.  Some of the greatest musicians of all time playing together.  Tribute to George Harrison.  Disc 1 is a sitar orchestra. Watch it once and say, \\"That's interesting\\", then throw it away.  Disc 2 is incredible. If you can watch Billy Preston doing \\"My Sweet Lord\\", Sam Brown on, \\"Horse to Water\\", and Eric Clapton on, \\"When My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and not be moving your body, check for a pulse.  Hell, the backup players include Paul McCartney, ELO's Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, Ringo Starr.  Just get it, thank me later.
B000BC8STC|5.0|I don't think I've ever witnessed a more intense, hard-driving, relentless display of pure energy and talent than I just did watching this video.  James Brown is without a doubt not only the hardest working man in show business, but also has the most stamina and staying power.  I actually felt sorry for his musicians on the stage - not even a bathroom break!  But if he is incredibly talented, so is everyone in his band.  Maybe not as much as him, but in their area of expertise, they shine, and even radiate a glow of excellence.  This production was fantastic - from the camera work, the sound, the direction, everything was fabulous.  The only mystery is why the cameraman seemed to deliberately turn the camera away when James was doing his incredible dance steps.  And he did it repeatedly - every time James Brown would start to dance, the camera was looking at something else.  Maybe the cameraman was jealous.  Anyway, nobody puts on a more frenetic show than this.  Great, and great!  You'll love it.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Live concert with David Gilmore, Richard Wright, Nick Mason of the original Pink Floyd, as well as some new guys and the fabulous Sam Brown on Backup vocals.  I bought it for one song, \\"Comfortably Numb\\", but I got so many other great ones.  \\"Time\\" is stunning as well. Gilmore looks to be having fun, and demonstrates why he may be the greatest guitar player of all time.  The set and lights are spectacular, and I could just watch the backup singers dance,  so the great audio is just a bonus.  Be aware it's in 4 x 3, and they make no apologies about it.  It must have been awesome to be there.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Though I was originally looking for another version I play on my phones but couldn't find it on Amazon's appstore, I  thought I 'd try this one on my new tablet.  Not only does it play great, I  really like the layout on a larger screen.
B004XJHBCE|2.0|I downloaded this when it was the app of the day and it was pretty convenient. I categorized my apps and made widgets that could hold more icons on my home screens.  It was kind of annoying that the app had so many updates, but it was really no big deal. Sometimes after an update my icons wouldn't display correctly, but that was fixable by either force closing this app, removing and replacing the affected widget, or restarting my phone.  Well, about a month ago one of those updates screwed up my widget's appearance again so that about half the icons are missing. I've done everything that fixed this problem in the past, multiple times, but it hasn't fixed it, and neither have any subsequent updates.  I have it only two stars because one of the main features if this app, making folders, doesn't work. If an update came out that fixed this problem and it remained stable for some time then I'd alter this review. Until such time though, I give it a negative review for not working.  Htc Evo 3D
B0063IH60K|4.0|As distracting as some of the ads are, this is a great app!  I would highly recommend this game.  Warning: Highly addictive.
B002IKLZZY|1.0|I am extremely disappointed with this DVD.  The color quality is very poor.  The skin looks very green in most of the scenes.  It really detracts from the story as I kept thinking they all looked like Frankenstein.  The sound is also very low and I had to turn the volume on the TV up to 30 (when it is usually at 10).  I would not recommend this version to anybody.  The extra disk does not make up for the poor quality.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I didn't expect a lot when I bought this film. I saw one preview of it and thought it looked interesting, maybe something like Crossroad with Ralph Machio. It soon got my interest as I watched it. I will not go into details; but this film became one of the best films I have seen in my life. I have two children that are music majors with degrees from college and are now music teachers. This movie is about the love for music and what music means to many people. It is a fairy tale, and quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. If you love music you will love this movie.  Signed, moved to tears!  P.S.  I have read a review (only one) where some gave this movie one star.There were others but I didn't read them. I feel sorry for these people. They obviously have a very dark outlook on the world. Again I give this movie five stars,and would rate it higher if I could. I could write more but, just watch the movie. Bye, ya'll
B005DR64SC|5.0|I am actually surprised at the amount of negative reviews for this film. I recently watched this movie as I thought it looked good and I was actually very surprised at how good it really was. The tension and suspense in the movie was well done. It was well acted and there was enough twists and turns to captivate the viewer for the whole movie. Maybe people expected to much because this thriller was exactly what it promised to be. I highly recommend this movie. Avoid the negativity this movie deserves some recognition and is worth a look.
0316098329|1.0|I could not make myself get further than about 1 hour into this audio book.  I felt like a voyeur, waiting for something horrible to happen, knowing something horrible would happen, dreading that something horrible would happen. To know that situations such as the one described in this book actually have occurred is bad enough and if you follow the news you already know more than you need to know.  To realize that someone spent the time imagining--down to the smallest detail--what such a life would be like, in order to novelize it and make a profit, gave me a sick feeling deep down in the center of my being.  I don't want to suggest that we bury our collective heads in the sand and pretend these monsters don't exist. A non-fiction account attempting to explain the real-world people who \\"inspired\\" (a better word for it might be \\"triggered\\") this story might be acceptable, in my opinion, if there were a lesson to be learned that would be applicable to a wide swath of humanity (which I doubt).  However I sincerely do not believe the world needs a fictional account of something like this. It simply feeds our ghoulish tendencies, appealing to the part of us that slows down at a traffic accident to rubberneck and get a glimpse of--what is it we are hoping to see?  Some blood? A body? Someone crying?  Why are we so eager to witness the disgrace suffered by another? Far better to turn away and pay attention to the road on which we are travelling. Don't succumb to the baser part of your nature. Rather than gawk at this car wreck of a book, find something positive to read and then practice what you learn on the people around you. The Five Love Languages would be a good start.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I've been having a lot of fun with this game. Totally worth the money. The online is pretty cool also.
0385534639|5.0|This is a glorious love story filled with smoldering drama, unique and lovable characters, and a truly magical circus. I will not say more in regard to the story, other than I never wanted it to end.  This is a probably a hit or miss book. In my opinion, it is loved or hated with rarely an in-between. I have two suggestions for anyone considering purchasing this book. First, and most importantly, don't start it unless you can read in a marathon session, over a long weekend perhaps. Second, pay careful, though not obsessive, attention to the dates at the beginning of each chapter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought this game was extreamly, extreamly fun, although, I am only writing this rewiew so I can get lots of points.
B000P0J09W|4.0|Jeepers!  I saw this when I was a teenager and remembered it being a great movie with lots of adventure, laughs and greats sets, which it is.  However, in the interim from childhood to when I showed it to my seven- and eight-year-old children, I somehow purged any memories of the movie's extensive profanity.  My wife and I winced as various characters used the \\"S\\" word throughout the film (okay, it was probably less than ten times, but still).  Seems rather unnecessary to have all the \\"S\\" bombs in there along with the \\"damn\\" and \\"hell\\" variations.  Next time, we'll preview some of the fondly remembered oldies before showing them to the children, unless they come with the safe \\"G\\" rating.  Great movie, but just exercise caution with the young ones.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I bought these DVD for my husband who is a big Beatles fan and the day he got them he watched all 5 DVD in two days.....could not get him away from them. said it was the best he has very seem about the Beatles! :)
B002U0KHMY|4.0|Based on its price and existing reviews, I decided to try \\"White Collar,\\" Season 1 and believe me, it was worth all 1,900+ pennies.  The story revolves around a classy master thief (played by Matt Bomer) who strikes a deal with the FBI agent (played by Tim McKay) who caught him twice, all in order to avoid going back to jail.  The agent works in the FBI's white-collar crime division in New York City and the master thief is there to provide a criminal's perspective to each case.  Catch is that the thief is confined to a two-mile radius by an ankle bracelet and needs to locate his missing girlfriend.  Tiffany Thiessen (of \\"90210\\" fame) stars as the agent's wife.  Great cast works well together.  Solid, believable scripts kept me interested and jonesing for season 2.  Could be filmed in L.A. for all I know, but looks like NYC to me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great product. Very useful for Christians on the go, or any student of Comparative Religion. I'm a Pastor and I use this app for my daily Bible Study and when doing research for sermons.
B004SBX112|5.0|Angry Birds is such an awesome game. I love it when they make the noise when you throw them in the air. My mom and dad downloaded it on their phone. So I always just play on it on their phone. It so funny....I love ANGRY BIRDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I like this cover, but the flap that stands it up is not made of a very strong material and it doesn't stand up very well.  It does work well for protection, but wasn't exactly like I saw from the picture.
B000EXZI14|5.0|The Bee Gees were very use to performing live and apparently really loved it based on this terrific cd. Something tells me I saw this on HBO, and perhaps I did and always wanted the cd. In any event, the boys were on their game and they roll through their hits, with Barry still retaining that great falsetto. My only regret is that they didn't do \\"Inside and Out\\" their early 80's hit. But it's a small regret as I have the original recording. This is a terrific cd.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|\\"Mahnattan\\" was my favorite Woody allen movie, but I think \\"Midnight in Paris\\" has just taken top place in my book. It is Woody allen at his finest, a quirky, intellectual, weird and wonderful film. I bought this DVD from Amazon as soon as it was available, after having seen it in the movie theatre. Wonderful scenes of Paris, present and past, and an eccentric assortment of characters. You will come out of this movies smiling. It has a very liberal viewpoint, so some people won't like it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is great game...even better than the original game...more options and great play on a tablet. I tried the original game, but it had a roller ball on the screen...that doesn't work very well on a tablet.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great product.  I have used other note taking products in the past and Evermore is just as good...if not better than the competition.  And it's free!
0307269752|4.0|I've had this book on my shelves for over a year and I just couldn't get in to the story.  It starts out so slow and learning all of the family history and all of those Swedish names is not easy.  I gave up.  I finally went to the movie to see if it was even worth reading.  The movie, while quite graphic, was pretty good.  So, I went home, grabbed the book off the shelf and started reading.  Seeing the movie first really helped me absorb more of the family history and all of their names.  There was also quite a bit of the story that didn't make it to the movie.  Very helpful information that made the characters more multi-dimensional.  Their quirks, parts of their personalities made much more sense.  While the book was quite graphic in nature the author wrote it in a way that was easier to read and there wasn't as much detail to the awful things that happened.  This is a true mystery and I think it was fun to read.  The next book is already on order!
B001KNVJE2|5.0|Styx has been unfortunate all these years suffering the unjust fate of other great bands like Supertramp and to some extent Queen as their music defies clear categorisation frustrating people who have the irrational hangup of just having to be able to neatly compartmentalise music.  As Styx doesn't clearly fit into the Rock genre for some given their clearly thearetical/musical/operatic leanings they must be bad or a rotten band in some \\"experts\\" eyes.  Thankfully for those of us who just enjoy great music irrespective of whether or not it comfortably fits into any genre can still enjoy great rock ballads ala Dennis DeYoung as well as hard rocking numbers ala Tommy Shaw in the same album without feeling we have to apologise for it; we can just enjoy the great band that is Styx.<br /><br />And so fans are in for a real treat here as Styx's best ever album is now in mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) format and it is one of the better mlps releases that I've ever seen.  For mlps collectors, the outside cardboard case isn't the best that's ever been released but it is not the worst I've ever seen either.  The inner jacket is very well done and resembles the original vinyl jacket closely.  Also included is a 16-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well as a cardboard square of the original vinyl center circle.  There is also a nice foldout colour poster of the band included.<br /><br />Why is this Styx's best album?  Well, as far as cohesive, flowing material with a coherent concept (fame and fortune is an illusion) throughout goes this album is excellent from start to finish and has to be heard at one sitting to be truly appreciated as the masterpiece that it is.  Some of Styx's best tracks are here from the title track to \\"Foolin' Yourself\\", \\"Come Sail Away\\", \\"Miss America\\" and indeed there are no filler tracks here as the other album tracks are very strong indeed.  It seems that every band member is at the top of their game here as well both in terms of musicianship as well as in songwriting.  Styx would never make another album as good as this one.<br /><br />Also, the sound quality is very good having been well remastered making this mlps release a worthy addition to your sonic library.<br /><br />Highly recommended!cianship as well as in songwriting.  Styx would never make another album as good as this one.  Also, the sound quality is very good having been well remastered making this mlps release a worthy addition to your sonic library.  Highly recommended!
B005K17RU0|4.0|this is a very nice kindle fire weather app. easily the best ive seen. it has radar, future forecasts and more with an easy to use interface. could stand some prettying up but still quite good overall.
B001ATDENA|4.0|Fans of this Stevie Wonder classic are in for a real treat as this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release comes well designed and assembled with a 16-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well.  While overall the album is not as great as the brilliant \\"Songs In the Key of Life\\" (very few albums if any are) or \\"Innervisions\\" it just pips out \\"Talking Book\\" for me in terms of the quality of the tracks and the overall coherency and flow of the album from start to finish.  That said this is still a very good album that still sounds good today as all classic albums should.  More brooding introspection and social commentary on the times here and has to be heard in conjunction with the other 3 albums mentioned earlier.  The sound quality on this release is good enough although not great as it is still a little muddy in spots and overall lacking audiophile expected clarity but this will still please most fans.<br /><br />Good enough sound quality for most, good mlps design to please the collectors and the great content makes this release recommended for your sonic library.
B0036TGT3E|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />Most of us are well acquainted with Disney's two obsessions in animation - royalty and anthropomorphic animals.  More precisely, Disney has excelled in portraying themes, truths, and morals traditionally espoused in Aesop's (predominately) animal fables but in feature-length movies.  Aesop succeeded in conveying his morals because he was usually able to grace his animal characters with human traits and yet let them retain believable animal natures.  Disney's animal movie fables (such as \\"Bambi\\", \\"Dumbo\\", \\"The Jungle Book\\", \\"Tarzan\\", \\"A Bug's Life\\") do the same, most of the time.  However, and I don't mean to be the literal skunk at the figurative tea party, \\"The Lion King\\" almost stumbles in selling its anthropomorphic tale of a prince facing mortality and responsibility.<br /><br />Ironically, this occurs in the opening spectacular \\"Circle of Life\\" sequence, where all the inhabitants of the African savanna congregate to witness and swear fealty to lord king Mufasa's (James Earl Jones's) new prince cub Simba.  If the characters were human, of course we would enthusiastically accept this stirring scene.  However, and many viewers have noticed this, many of the savannah subjects are herbivores and part of a lion's diet.  It doesn't make much sense to swear loyalty to someone who wants to eat you.  Also, we see giraffes and elephants genuflecting before Simba.  This wouldn't happen in real nature, that's for sure!  Elephants and other megaherbivores are the true lords of the savannah.  \\"The Lion King\\" (hereafter TLK) tries to account for this gruesome reality by having Mufasa state that, yes, lions eat antelopes but lions die and bring forth the grass that antelopes eat.  Therefore, antelopes, in a sense, eat the lions in turn.  Ehh, not convincing.<br /><br />The second, uneasy anthropomorphic fit occurs after Simba flees into self-imposed exile after mistakenly believing he caused his father's death in the wildebeest stampede, leaving the true culprit, his treacherous uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) to seize power.  After finally convinced by the shaman baboon Rafiki (Robert Guillomme - sp?) and his childhood friend Nala to return to the \\"kingdom\\" and wrest it from Scar's paws, Simba finds that under Scar's rule the verdant savannah has become a desolate wasteland (a real \\"fixer upper\\" according to wisecracking meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane)).  Of course, no animal has control over the climate or other animals' welfare.  The savannah endures cycles of moisture and drought regardless of who controls the pride. Again, this scene would work with human actors who would have SOME control over the welfare, if not climate, and so we pretend again that the animals are acting a human drama.<br /><br />Granted, there are only two instances in TLK that the anthropomorphic conceit doesn't really work, but they are the anchors of the Shakespeareanesque tale of kingship rejected, lost and won and so could potentially make TLK a little wobbly.  However, this problem will bother natural purists.  So please don't get me wrong; I really enjoyed this magnificent movie, because like most everyone else I could overlook these flaws and basically pretend that the characters were just humans in animals' clothing, just like in Aesop's fables.prit, his treacherous uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) to seize power.

1439152799|5.0|This was the first book of Kate Morton's that I read. I loved it. Completely. Am now reading The Forgotten Garden followed by The House at Riverton. Such an amazingly gifted writer. Can't wait for more works from this talented lady. Hope she can write as fast as I can read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very entertaining. I like the challenge of finishing the level/ games. Sometimes I get frustrated so I switch between games. I definately recommend this app.
1416583408|2.0|Most of what I'm about to say has already been said, but I thought I'd just chime in for support. There is one part where the author describes how dogs see that I had never heard before and was totally ignorant of. The description of dogs' retinae and their flicker-fusion rate is fascinating. It also made me look at my dogs differently. However, she is totally unwilling to accept that not all dogs are the same, while stating at the same time that all dogs are different. This is frustrating. She believes that dogs should always be allowed to approach each other, for example. I have two lovely, lovable dogs who adore people but hate other dogs. This is partially my fault because they were not properly socialized. I also believe that the fact they're terriers has something to do with it.  Then she says that dogs need to be petted based on their own personalities and experiences. If you allow for that, also allow for different approaches to other dogs.  I also agree with other reviewers who thought the anecdotes about the author's dog to be a bit much. I love dogs and I love stories about dogs, but spare me all the gazing into each others' eyes.  I think the information about dog biology is really interesting and might make this book worth reading. But, when it comes to being with your dog, trust yourself and your experiences with your dog because you know better than the author in that regard.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This is not a review of the quality of the game, which is superb. I played the entire campaign on my laptop and loved it. Hoping to relive the joy I got the Android version. It freezes near constantly. I can only occasionally finish a level without the game crashing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it. so much fun and challenging. very addicting. I cant wait to unlock. the other games! totally worth it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|The price is right and it tells you all you need to know in an eye catching display. It is also integrated with the general display so that you get a reading of the temperature at the upper right hand corner of the screen whenever you turn the kindle on.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|works great with my kindle fire. its quick to respond and the difficulty is easy to use and set. looks great too.
B005K2XUPK|3.0|The Timbuk 2 is safe enough for around the house but I do not like the velcro used to close it. I do not feel it is secure enough.
B005DC68NI|4.0|This is really two books. The first book is a defense of self-publishing, and an illumination of the massive paradigm shift in the publishing industry caused very much by the web page upon which you read these words right now. It's a water-tight case. I skimmed it, however, because I was already a believer.  The second book is why I purchased. It's a how-to for self-publishing authors. It offers a lot of practical advice, some outright recommendations, links to other tutorials and helpful sites. It has a ton of success stories, which I skipped, and an excellent list of references for the various vendors needed for people like me.  Some of the data is already out-of-date, however. I would think the e-book format would allow him to update various figures that have since changed, as it won't drastically change the content whatsoever.  It's useful and well worth the $2.99.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I learn a lot details about the different phases of the moon from this app.  I can easily scroll through all phases of the moon.  What I like most is the beautiful live wallpaper mode.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Well I don't like to write reviews but I do find them helpful when making a purchase on a line of products I don't know squat about. This (Ear Force X41 XBOX LIVE Chat + Wireless Digital RF Game Audio with Dolby Headphone 7.1 Surround Sound Purchased on 12/30/201 by Turtle Beach) has occasional popping sounds (probably wireless interferences) and they are loud. Yes I read the manual and moved things around but it didn't change at all. The fit is not uncomfortable but weird in that both my young daughter and I have to adjust the position (not size) while we are playing. The chat functions are great but I can't see what the hell it says on the chat controls (cord mounted) so I sharpied some lines across as a starting point. No I won't wear my glasses because I would have to put them on and to take them off I am 41 years stubborn. To sum up my personal experience they are 100 times better than the Xbox originals and my wife stopped screaming \\"TURN DOWN THAT NOISE!\\" but keep in mind I have never had the opportunity to try anything else. Maybe the popping sounds are the way it is or maybe it has a problem. IDK?
B001F290E4|3.0|We all know Seal has an amazing voice, my only issue is that he didn't really add anything to the songs. The covers are good, but I guess I always want a cover of something to bring something else out in the song. Instead it just seemed like a karaoke night out with Seal.
B000M343BM|3.0|A captivating, often hilarious, sometimes lewd, rude and profane baseball underdog story that remains the only time the Indians have finished the season with a postseason victory since 1948. Like \\"Naked Gun\\" the jokes sometimes come so fast and furiously that only some of them hit the mark, but there are many laugh-till-you-cry moments and quotable lines. As someone who lived in Cleveland from 1977-2000, the movie has special poignancy for me, especially the brilliant opening. The movie is \\"just a bit outside\\". It is a little too sentimental, silly and unfocused to match the best satires and a little too wacky, lewd and profane to equal the best romcoms or underdog dramas. Still, it is crowd-pleasing entertainment, helped a lot by good-looking action scenes. (Although Tom Berenger does need to work on his bunting) It earns its R rating for its lewdness and rudeness, including partial and cardboard nudity.
B004LUHQ1G|3.0|Sounds like EVERY OTHER FOO FIGHTER ALUM since `The Colour and the Shape' which we all know what excellent.  Now simmer down all you Foo heads... I certainly think they are one of the better bands in the game. If only bc I secretly idolize Dave Grohl... for his drumming mostly, but I do really think he's talented. I just feel like a lot of their latest discs aren't really bringing something novel to the table. I mean, if you followed alternative you KNOW you remember how epic `Everlong' was... and THEN the amazing video for it came out. Or the `Big Me' song and video. They seemed to have had a creative lapse in such arenas. Their singles on all their albums are decent, but not mind blowing. I still get tingles when I hear \\"My Hero\\", but I'm not really getting that from them anymore.  Must be that I'm getting old and can't rock as hard... or maybe... I'm rocking even HARDER! (No, you likely won't get a Pantera review soon.... or will you?)  That said, I'll give this album three stars... I can hang with it. It doesn't make my ears bleed, but is it something I'm going to crave listening to everyday? NnnnnnnnOPE!  One lil bright spot though is `Arlandria'... will it be an all-time best? Not likely with the discography that they have.... but Grohl vocals and Hawkins drums set the pace. Shoot, you could ALMOST have synchronized hand claps to it. And you know I'm a sucker for those.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|As another review stated this thing is extremely lightweight and when I received it I was ready to ship it back.  Instead I thought I might as well give it a go and so I installed it onto my Kindle Fire.  It is so well made and such a perfect fit that I immediately changed my mind and enthusiastically endorse it!  It adds almost no bulk, nor weight and it is exactly what I was looking for.  It protects and defends with no down side that I have been able to determine.
B004I654WQ|5.0|I purchased this set because even as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed these movies just as much as my kids and grand-kids do. This way I have a copy whenever I have my grand-kids over. Both versions of Cars are hilarious and entertaining!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great app! I love that there are different translations and Bible reading plans. You have the option to read the Bible in a year or in chronological order. The only downside is the Internet is required to use the app.
0062082353|5.0|I read A LOT of these types of books.  I have never bothered to write a review for a book in my life - this is the absolute best book of its type that I have ever read.  I read it twice - my son read it, my dad read it, I took it to work and all the guys are reading it and waiting to read it.  I served in Iraq - this guy speaks the truth.  Again - outstanding read - worth every penny.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this was a great app. there were so many games to choose from It kept me busy for hours on end
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I gave this to my brother as a birthday present,  he was very pleased with the quality and ease to do the setup.  it met expectations.
B00005A8MA|5.0|This is one of my favorite records. Great from start to finish. The list of stars playing on it is incredible. Great songs. This is however, one time, I must disagree with the Artist. Re-mixes were not needed for any track on this double cd.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am a physician and I am always coming across journal articles, etc. that I want to be able ti reference later on.  An example is a great article I found recently on a new way to numb up a patient's ankle for sutures or ti fix a fracture.  It could easily be 6-12 months before I need to do something like that, and bu that time, I might nit be able to find the original article.  I can just drop the article into Evernote, and I can access the article from my PC, iphone, Internet, ir Kindle.  Evernote allows Md to organize notes from a variety of formats, so they are easy to find!
6305079900|5.0|The 1997 version has much better sound. Newer version has a desert eagle sounding like a silenced gun.  Less special features though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This reads to you. It has a wonderful Bible Study plan. looking forward spending much time in the word with this app.
B00702NWW4|5.0|It's like Chris Isaak and Martha Davis of the Motels got married and had a baby.  Call her a modern day Nancy Sinatra.  A retro romantic.  A totally created persona.  Call her whatever you want, but there's no denying the music of Lana Del Rey is compulsively listenable.  I simply cannot get enough.  Apparently there are others who feel the same way.  Those who don't can always change the channel.  I, however, am sticking around in the hopes that this is just the beginning.
0312576463|5.0|This book is a great read, especially if you are a young Baby Boomer from the Midwest...Also, if you have been keenly aware of the crazy way the USA has reacted to certain events in the last 10 years - starting with 9/11 - you will enjoy this book as well.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|My nephew is a big fan of The Beach Boys and he just loved this set. He's been playing guitar since he was 6 and they, along with The Beatles, were a big influence on him. I can't really comment on the content as we only listened to a few tracks on 1 CD but if you're a die-hard Beach Boys fan I would think it's a must have. I couldn't believe it came with 2 LP's!
159562015X|2.0|I read this and was amazed by number 4 & 5 star comments. I don't review many purchases but I just had to comment on this.  Really you are buying the book to do the online test. I would have been happier paying $5 get the test and not have the printed book mailed to me.  I've done a few of these, and essentially this didn't provide any amazing insights. It stays clear of the negatives, which some say is a good thing. Personally I need to know my negatives so as I can know what areas I need to have people support me in making up for those weaknesses.  The book just didn't really have a lot of meat. There are 33 page of intro, and then really you are just paying for the code to allow you to take the online test. The online test is ok, the report essentially gives you a PDF of your strengths and a blurb about them. In essence the same detail that is in the book.  The test told me many of the same things as my MBTI - but in a much longer version.  Overall - I feel cheated out of $10. The online test was worth $5. I wouldn't count on being wowed. However if you have never done any of these types of test you may like it.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I'd say you have to have at least a small interest in sports to watch this movie. But you don't have to be a fan of baseball, because I'm not. This was an interesting, sometimes funny, and intelligent movie. It was fascinating knowing this was all a true story and how this changed baseball and what all occurred. However, I do not believe that Jonah or Brad deserve Oscars. They did a rather good job acting, but it was not Oscar worthy, in my opinion.  Girls may like this movie as well. I myself being female rather enjoyed it. Is it action packed, suspenseful, a gut buster, or a romance for the times? No. And it doesn't try to be. It's a real world, yet slightly transcended movie that is easy to watch and worth taking a couple hours to sit down and experience. Rent this one, but I wouldn't buy because I doubt you'll want to watch it more then once or twice. SPOILER: WHY didn't he go to Boston!? He could have become so much more. Alas.
B00702NWW4|4.0|I'm not going to touch on the hype and negativity surrounding Lana Del Rey (which has polarized folk months before her album was even released, with many hoping she falls flat on her face), as I'm sure loads of reviewers will do a fine job of that. What I will talk about is the music which, while not ground-breaking, is pretty nice. Dark, cinematic,string-swathed pieces, set to gently throbbing electro or Hip Hop beats best describes her sound, almost Trip Hop.<br /><br />Opening is the brooding title track sung in her doleful lower register. The sweeping \\"Off To The Races\\" finds her deftly flitting from low husky tones to higher girly notes. \\"Blue \\"Jeans\\" starts off sounding like something from a spaghetti western (and name checks James Dean), while the song that started it all, the spare \\"Video Games\\" allows one to appreciate her vocals which are pushed to the fore.<br /><br />Other highlights are \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" (with tinkling piano and clipped Hip Hop beats), the quivery \\"Radio\\", the ballad \\"Million Dollar Man\\"(which sounds like a meeting of Garbage and Nancy Sinatra), and \\"This Is What Makes Us Girls\\" (with a faint Timbaland hue). There are a few average same-sounding songs, but closing on winning form (on the deluxe version anyway) is the brilliant ballad \\"Lucky Ones\\" which reminds me (in parts) of seventies Elton John. A pleasant musical experience for the unbiased. Her fans can breathe easy.
B001NA2NMO|5.0|I loved everything about this movie.  The acting was wonderful.  I fell in love with all the \\"freaks\\", especially Freida and Hans.  The freaks were beautiful and frightening at the same time.  Don't miss this unusual and memorable movie.

0385344228|4.0|The comparisons I've seen of \\"Defending Jacob\\" and \\"Presumed Innocent\\" are valid ones - but not for the reason I would have thought at first.  True, the stories involve a prosecuting attorney embroiled in a murder that ends up hitting far too close to home...but more accurately for me, they are similar in that the main character in each remains emotionally closed off to the reader.  It becomes increasingly obvious that there is something the main character, in this case Andy Barber, does not want the reader to know.  There is some piece of the puzzle that he has that the reader does not.<br /><br />\\"Like many people who have been exposed to violence, I confined my emotions within a narrow range.  Never too high, never too low.  Since I was a kid, I have always made sure of that.  My emotions ran on steel rails.\\"<br /><br />A classmate of Andy's son Jacob is murdered, Andy begins working on the case...and then his son Jacob is arrested for the crime.  Andy and his wife Laurie are completely blindsided by the charges and they are forced to look more closely at their son, their family and themselves as parents.  There is no going back to the life they thought they led once the events are set in motion, and through Andy's eyes, the reader is given a very tightly controlled view of his world.<br /><br />\\"I thought it was important to be - at least to seem - a tower of strength and to encourage her to be strong as well.  It was the only sensible approach: Tough it out, get through the trial, do whatever it takes to keep Jacob safe, then repair the emotional damage later.  After.  It was as if there was a place called After, and if I could just push my family across to that shore, everything would be all right.\\"<br /><br />But of course, nothing is all right.  The isolation, the doubt, the grief and worry eat away at Laurie and undermine Andy's view of his role as a husband and father.  They are forced to confront so much in the face of few facts and fewer insights into their son.  Andy and Laurie's happy marriage soon becomes a distant memory.  Both Laurie and Andy wonder what parts of themselves are actually true and which parts are facades.<br /><br />\\"All that ease, all that naturalness, all that credulous self-confidence.  For years I had studied men like Burt French, despised them, copied them.\\"<br /><br />I did wonder why the story was set in 2007.  With the constant mentions of Facebook, Twitter and various I devices, it felt like it was set in present day...yet the events take place 4 years ago.

B0067LY4WG|4.0|\\"Old Ideas\\" is Leonard Cohen's first album in 7 years, and is filled with poetic, spiritual musings in his spoken-style gravely (sometimes rumbling) baritone set to Blues (\\"Darkness\\"), Jazz (\\"Anyhow\\"), Hymnal (\\"Going Home\\", \\"Show Me The Place\\", \\"Come Healing\\"), Folk (\\"Crazy To Love You\\"), and Country (\\"Show Me The Place\\", \\"Banjo\\").<br /><br />Providing additional vocals and harmonies on some songs are Jennifer Warnes, Dana Glover (she of \\"It Is You (I Have Loved)\\" from the \\"Shrek\\" soundtrack fame), Sharon Robinson, and The Webb Sisters. Everything meanders at a similar languid and classy pace, except the organ-sprinkled \\"Different Sides\\" which ups the tempo a wee bit. My favourite though is \\"Amen\\", a tender shuffle with a lovely horn solo which conjures images of taking a walk somewhere in Paris. Absolutely delightful!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Amazing cross platform functionality. Use this in my computer, phone, and Kindle fire. Could use better calendar integration but well worth a free download.

030788743X|2.0|I'll begin by saying I WANTED to like this book...a lot. After reading countless Amazon user reviews which loved Ready Player One, I got excited when it finally arrived.<br /><br />I am a child of the 80's and the images and culture Ernest Cline constantly alludes to and references are spot-on and give the reader a real sense of nostalgia.<br /><br />Now the bad stuff...<br /><br />I can't really ignore how poor the dialogue is written. It doesn't flow and is frankly, pretty bad. While reading this book, I couldn't stop thinking about how Cline probably had a massive breadth of 80's pop culture knowledge in his brain and decided to write a book around that. Mistake #1. Plus, characters are not creatively introduced, more so the opposite. The author spends chapter 1 explaining the world, chapter 2 explaining the protagonist, and chapter 3 introducing supplemental characters and the villains. It's all very, very juvenile and not compelling at all.<br /><br />Which is what I suppose my biggest complaint is. I felt like this book is meant for 16 year old readers, not adults. I accept this as being Cline's first book and applaud his efforts. But as a consumer, I thought this book was just plain bad. He should never have tried to create a story around a theme. That is a skill that I feel only the most accomplished writers can do. Instead, he should have written a solid story, then created the world and culture around it.<br /><br />Long story short - I enjoyed the pop-culture references, but hated the story, character development, and dialogue.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|We love this show and have every season.  I can't wait to finish the other seasons {again} so I can watch this one and 6.
B003O86MY8|5.0|This is Awesome Stuff! Great for anyone who enjoys classical or rock or both! Our whole family loves listening to David Garrett in Rock Symphonies! Would love to have the live video too!
B004XZR63M|4.0|I found this book to be intriguing. I never thought about the points that were brought up in the book, and I recommend it for everyone to read it, because the book approaches from an angle that many of us never see. All minute details aside, the book gives the reader a good point of view in finances, which makes a huge impact in our lives.  I'm not quite sure whether or not his advices and tips, beliefs are good or dangerous, but for me, it opened up a door to a different world.
B0062NAVXA|4.0|Ok, I saw this in the theater and as a Christian I always go to support these films and always gain so much from them.  This one is by far my favorite hands-down.  I had no idea of the story line going in and was weeping (yes I'm man enough to admit that - smile) and so encouraged and inspired as a man. At the end you want to stand up and SHOUT!  As a Christian I pray and hope that when I get married and have kids that I'm this kind of Husband and Father. America needs more of this, the world needs more of this. REAL MEN! Not perfect but trying and striving.<br /><br />I highly recommend that all MEN take time to watch this regardless if you are young or old, married or single, a parent or not one yet. Watch this film to inspire your life, call to your manhood and encourage your soul for what you should be always reaching up for.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!  ;)
0307959856|5.0|Celebrated mystery writer P.D. James has pulled off a seemingly impossible coup:  she has written a compelling mystery using both authentic period language and police techniques while staying true to the characters which all Austenphiles know and love.<br /><br />It is six years after Darcy and Lizzie have married, and life at Pemberley is just as \\"happily-ever-after\\" as we all hoped it would be.  Two fine sons have been born, Bingley and Jane have relocated from Meryton to a lovely estate in Derbyshire just a few miles from Pemberley, and Mr. Bennet is just as welcome a presence at Pemberley as Austen had assured her devoted readers that he would be.  It is time for the annual \\"Lady Anne ball,\\" held every year in honor of Darcy's late mother, and preparations are well underway when a hysterical Lydia arrives late one night in a hired chaise, screaming bloody murder.<br /><br />It turns out that Captain Denny, the reprehensible Mr. Wickham's only friend, has been killed in the Pemberley Woods, and Wickham, drunk and sobbing about his responsibility in the crime, is discovered blood-covered over the body.<br /><br />The novel then takes its fascinated reader through a police procedural, circa 1803, complete with a fascinating trial and some completely unexpected plot twists.  Some reviewers have scoffed at the book because it is not filled with many of the thrilling procedural aspects which lend so much interest to James' other popular mysteries.  But I believe that James has done something much more admirable here.  She has shown what a murder investigation would be like before all the set-pieces which we have come to expect were so firmly in place.  I found this authentic rather than frustrating.<br /><br />I loved this book.  I read a lot of Austen tribute literature, but this is by far the most interesting, accurate and all-around good fun.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that the relationship between Darcy and Lizzie is not enough on display, but I disagree entirely.  This book shows us what their marriage truly would have been like.  They each have separate duties, and they clearly are still mad about each other.  The scenes at the end of the book where old misunderstandings between the most famous romantic couple of all are aired and their love is reconfirmed are absolutely true to their respective characters, and so well-written. Ms. James also manages to bring the reader up to date on other Austen characters, not only from \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but from \\"Persuasion\\" and \\"Emma.\\"  This is the work of an author who knows and loves Ms. Austen's books.<br /><br />Even if you are not a regular mystery reader, but love Jane Austen, I recommend this book without reservation. It is a treasure.riage truly would have been like.  They each have separate duties, and they clearly are still mad about each other.

B005J6LKVI|4.0|I grew up in the south and close to the area this story was about and shot in. I really enjoyed it. Great story line, great acting, very well done. It will give you a lot of laughs, remind you of how we are still fighting persecution today in ways that are hard to see. We still greatly discriminate not so much about color but in other ways. It comes down to fears and lack of understanding (closed minds) and we still mis-treat men and women of all races today that are \\"different\\" and one day we'll look back like we do now and ask \\"How could this have happened?\\".  At times during the movie I wanted to jump and beat some of these people up for what they were saying and the EGO that was in action, but then I thought I have done the same thing and had the same thing done to me.<br /><br />This story is well done, entertaining, funny, but also deep to remind us of where we've come from, what we are capable of, and how we need to learn the basic human instincts that caused this in the first place.<br /><br />I promise you! Watch this for the PIE scene alone. LOL You will laugh and cheer so hard!!<br /><br />ENJOY!

0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain has done a really impressive job in arguing how important it is for introverts to value themselves even though American culture is so skewed towards the extrovert ideal.  She lists all the things we would not have in our world were it not for an introvert: the Internet, Apple, or even (perhaps) the Civil Rights movement.  So passionate is Susan Cain about the power o introversion that sometimes she seems to be almost apologizing to that half of the world (and presumably her readers) who are extroverts.  That, I admit, made me (a self-confessed introvert) smile.  After all, most of the time, I read books that say there is nothing (much) wrong with being an introvert (which those books equate with being shy).  It was therefore quite nice to read a book that so systematically demolished the many myths about introverts, beginning with the definition.<br /><br />Introverts are not shy people; they are people who prefer low levels of stimulation.  They draw their energy from quiet me-time whereas extroverts draw their energy from other people.  Introverts are the leaders you need when you're trying to create something new because they allow (indeed encourage) everyone to have their own idea while the extrovert is the leader you need to keep something routine going because extroverts are the cheerleaders who can be counted on to make a routine task more fun.<br /><br />And if, like me, you're an introvert who has been criticized for not liking small talk or socializing activities or been told that you think too much, this book will come as a great relief.  Reading it is almost an affirmation; a kind of I am not alone moment.  It really is great to know that my introversion is inherited and that it is wholly normal.  That it's OK to not be able to think in groups (that, in fact, most people don't think well in groups), that innovation really does happen when you work alone, and that many of the most famous people (from Warren Buffet to Rosa Parks to Darwin) are or were introverts.<br /><br />Quiet has little good to say about our culture's extrovert ideal which has created a world where introverts must struggle so hard to carve out a niche for themselves.  In our world, even the office space (with its open floor plan) is tailor made for the extrovert.  And that's not even counting the frequent presentations and meetings people are expected to give and attend.  In our world, there doesn't seem to be room for thought; only for talking.  And yet, the introvert's power lies in solitary thought and quiet persuasion.<br /><br />That's the first part of the book, anyway.  The second half reads a lot like many of the other self-help manuals out there.  The advice to identify our core passions (which Susan Cain provides in the second half of the book) for example, is advice that's good for anyone--and advice I at least have heard many times before.  So, my personal advice is to read the first half of the book several times.  It can really change the way you see the world and yourself and maybe skim over the second part.Quiet has little good to say about our culture's extrovert ideal which has created a world where introverts must struggle so hard to carve out a niche for themselves.

B000RH0C8G|4.0|I really enjoyed this look into baseball and appreciated the analytical approach known as Sabermetrics that was talked about at length. The story is interesting and well written and kept me continuously glued to the pages which is probably why Brad Pitt and Hollywood made the movie. However, it is not a thorough analysis of analytics in baseball and does not do the subject complete justice. In future reprints I would appreciate a forward or mention to some of the counter points that people have made questioning the effectiveness and success of the Sabermetric approach.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|How does one come to grasp with the realities of the past? You first connect with those around you, especially if they reveal to you the realities of the past that they had been coping with and trying to protect you from in a very hurtful way to themselves. This movie is a wonderful look into hurt feelings, betrayel and protecting love for those around you. Look deep into yourself as George Clooney and how you would respond to what you learn and feel.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I thought this was a very enjoyable and a pretty quick read.  I liked the cover art, I'd say it's a good representation of the book.  The writing is very detailed and descriptive.  The reader can fully visualize the atmosphere in which the characters live.  The image of the circus was so detailed and came through so clear to me that I could really see it.  If such a thing were possible, I'd actually want to see a circus like that in real life.  The story took place from 1873 - 1903.  Even though this took place over 100 years ago, I don't feel that the time period is the focus, the circus is.  I think the time period in which the story took place allowed that circus to be more magical, yet I didn't feel like I was reading historical fiction.<br /><br />For the rest of my review, check out my book blog.

B005L3HKTU|4.0|For those who are familiar with Insomnium, you know that they are relentless with their signiture take on Melodic Death Metal; Pounding drums, deep and unique vocals, and haunting and powerful riffs and melodies. What makes Insomnium Insomnium can be hard to explain, as by discription they sound like many other MDM bands. However, when put into practice, they have a unique and masterful grasp on the genre that not all have. This album, One For Sorrow, is similar to their other releases in that it features more haunting melodies on guitars and keyboard, the same sytle of vocals by Nillo Sevanen, and lyrics that are sorrowful and poetic. However, on this release, especially when compared to their last, the songs are more fast-paced, hard, and driven. To be sure, there are still the quiet interludes to add atmosphere, but the riffing is heavier than ever in places as well, particularly on songs like Only One Who Waits and Every Hour Wounds. This is a bit of a plus and a minus to me, as I am more fond of the more progressive, melodic, and atmospheric pieces in their catalog, yet at the same time it also gives your Insomnium listening experience a little more variety. My favorite songs off the album are Song Of The Blackest Bird, Unsung, both of which compare with the best Insomnium has ever done. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star instead of 5 is that it doesn't have the same \\"I can listen to all the songs without skipping\\" feeling that Across The Dark and Above The Weeping World have.

B004XN3FHA|4.0|This is my first bigger and expensive flashlight. I tried it out tonight and the light level intervals work out just fine. The turbo mode is too bright for using inside a house. The beam spreads out nicely and it has a good size hot spot. This light is more of a thrower. The finish looks good and the knurling is comfortable. I just got it so I can't comment on battery life. Right now I'm waiting for my new rechargeable batteries to show up so I'm running it on 4 older rechargeable batteries right now. That's a convenient feature to be able to run in on 4 batteries if needed instead of requiring 8 cells only. One irritating thing. Th battery carrier rattles slightly inside the body of the flashlight. At this price level for a flashlight I would expect it to be rattle free so I took one star off for that.<br /><br />Dec 27,2012- This flashlight is my go to flashlight for around the house use and even for camping. The four light levels give it great flexibility for all my needs.

B006O5XYWG|5.0|I'm surprised how much better the computer generated monkey could act than the real actors in the film.  Fortunately the computer generated monkey is the star of this one.<br /><br />The film is a blend of \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" and \\"I am Legend\\", with a little of \\"Cool hand Luke\\" to boot.<br /><br />The ads would have you believe it's a tale of war between monkeys and men (in which the men are bested).  Not at all.  It's a good story, and not as violent as you might think.  I'll avoid spoiling the ending, but the monkeys are not all that bad.
0393057240|5.0|All I can say is that the main characters of 'Trainspotting': Rents, Spud, Sick boy and the Beggarman have never left me since reading the novel back in the 90's. `Trainspotting' featuring the exploits of these now famous four, put working class Edinburgh on the map and is pure catnip to its readers or awesome movie version fans. The local dialect/vocabulary, characters and storyline is as distinctive and at time challenging as Burgesses `Clockwork Orange'. Welsh the bard of the new century Scots working class consciousness. A must read unless you're easily offended, too old or Tory ie: English conservative.

B003ES61EE|2.0|I can't say that this met my expectations.  The cleaning material (the foam pad stuff) only works on the mildest of finger prints.  I tested it on a lens filter that my 1 year old got a hold of, and the lens pen did nothing to recover from his slobber marks (okay that's asking too much).  If you put it in your pocket the \\"pen\\" part pops off.  That whole half of the pen is not designed well to say the least.  The brush is good, but I think I'd be happier with an old bellows style brush instead.  Oh well, not a big waste.

B004V6BQ3O|5.0|I was recommended this microphone from a distinguished professional in the video field specifically because it is bus-powered.  I used to use a VideoMic by Rode, but I would sometimes forget to turn on the microphone, and it's quite bulky on top of a DSLR.  I've been using this with my D7000 for about 3 weeks now and it's been excellent.  The sound quality is much better than the in-camera microphone:  soft, crisp and clear without much noise at all.  Of course I use this as backup.  External audio capture devices, such as the Zoom H1 I use, is well worth the extra work involved to get even better sound.  But for better in-camera audio, you can't beat this thing!  Ben

The film exceeded all our expectations and trust me, they were very high.  Everything - the wedding, honeymoon and the pregnancy was done to perfection  and OH,  THAT ENDING!!!  Definitely the most emotional , jaw dropping and suspenseful ending we had ever seen.  Cannot wait for this DVD!!!!
1594202842|5.0|I read this book during my attempt to read as many books as humanly possible during 2012.  Here is what I wrote on the blog I keep chronicling my experience:    Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother    I can think of few books in the last couple years that have elicited as much anger and controversy as \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\". At the beginning of last year, heated reactions to Amy Chua's parenting memoir pervaded media and bookstores. And yet I wasn't interested in reading it. I was aware that Chua apparently supported rigorous parenting, arguing that an A- is unacceptable, hours of daily instrument practice is necessary, and children are to be subjugated instead of cultivated.    Perhaps my disinterest stemmed from the fact that I was enrolled in an early childhood program that promoted a philosophy that was ideologically opposed to Chua's supposed concept. More likely, I was disinclined to read the book because I have been exposed to parents who believe their toddlers should be drilled in math and pre-literacy concepts. Two summers ago I interviewed for a job working with one-year-old twins. I had assumed it was a babysitting job but was soon informed that the infants had a full-time nanny and I would be their tutor. \\"I've been looking for toddler flashcards but I can't find them anywhere!\\" The woman said in frustration. \\"Maybe that's because one-year-olds can't read,\\" I said helpfully. I didn't get the job.    I passed on Tiger Mother until a friend whose opinion I respect mentioned it as an interesting read. This time, my curiosity was piqued. I am not currently working with high pressure parents or studying early childhood philosophy. Also, I have been on an absolute memoir binge lately.    So, armed with Pirate's Booty and a Diet Coke, I read it in one sitting. And I absolutely loved it. I thought for a while about the intense and wide-ranging emotions elicited by this memoir and here's what I ultimately concluded:    People who say this is a terrible bookbecause of Chua's parenting style are missing the point. Chua admits toward the beginning of the book that she had intended to write this as a defense of \\"Chinese parenting\\". However, as she is writing the book the unimaginable happens: Chua's youngest daughter hits puberty and goes rogue. This sets the tone for some truly epic showdowns between a strong, determined woman and her daughter, the opposition who inherited mom's tenacity and stubbornness. From my perspective, Chua writes with self-deprecating humor and a self-awareness that allows for reflection and, eventually, evolution.    I'm intrigued by her explanations and the rationale behind her strict parenting style. While it is not a philosophy to which I subscribe, I find myself agreeing with her more than I anticipated (DISCLAIMER: It is quite easy for me to debate the various parenting styles in my current childless state, as I sit in my pajamas drinking Diet Coke and writing at 10:30 on a Monday morning). Of course I have many questions about the socio-emotional impact of parenting with such high expectations. I also worry about the potential social stigma placed on children with developmental disabilities in environments with that much pressure to succeed. However, Chua's story is not a psychological study or sociological expose. It is the experience of one family. I felt that she is not necessarily defending or critiquing a particular way of life. Rather, she is telling a story of her experience as a parent: The exquisite, the sublime, and the very down & dirty. Chua is unflinchingly honest. I found myself empathizing with her even if I didn't agree with her decisions.    I recommend this book but with a caveat. Read this for what it is: one woman's harrowing journey through parenthood.    Please check out more of my reviews at[...]

B0061QD82E|5.0|For True Film Collectors Of Classic Disney Animation, you can put your mind to rest. I have seen a review from someone on the internet that assures us that the Video Is In It's OAR of 2:35:1 cinemascope, not 1:85:1 like the the specs say at the top of this page. I had to search hard to find this information. I had to know. It had to be in its OAR of 2:35:1 cinamascope for me to consider perchasing it at all. The way I knew it was in Cinemascope was the fact the person mentioned that the aspect ratio had black bars on top and bottom of the picture even when it filled the screen due to being enhanced for 16:9 TV. I even saw previews of still frames from the Cinemascope version from the blu-ray showing proof that the film is indeed in its OAR version of 2:35:1 cinemascope. This is indeed great to find out because I am a movie purest. I want the best quality and I want the OAR shown in theaters or I wouldn't consider buying it all.

0783231032|5.0|I originally got this on VHS, only to be replaced by DVD. Nice upgrade. If you're not a technophobe, and don't mind that it doesn't come with an original theatrical version, this is a great upgrade from the standard VHS version.<br /><br />For the movie itself, I can see why a lot of critics ragged on Spielburg for this. They just didn't get his humor and he was ahead of his time on this one. It's got so many subtle moments that if you don't pay attention, and you don't watch this more than once or are preoccupied when you watch, you're gonna miss half the movie. First, it's got the 40's pegged very well...both in styles, dress, mannerisms, and everything else. Maybe except Bobbie DiCicco's haircut...a bit long for a 40's sailor...but that's not a big deal really. The music, the dancing, the ebbs and flows of the action just draw you right into the looniness of the whole situation and how group-think can get carried away into panacea. In some ways, it's a lot like a combination of Blues Brothers, Animal House and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. It's got a who's who of actors. Slim Pickins sitting on the can on the Jap sub was one of the best clips on film. The Jaws parady opening scenes...just classic!!! The scene with the Japanese Submariners as ninja Christmas Trees (part of the new footage) is a great addition. The Dumbo scene in the theater...it just doesn't get much better. Belushi gassing up the plane, Ackroyd with the bug eyes, the Dummy on the ferris wheel are all great scenes. How can you not find that funny?<br /><br />Not all the added/new footage is classic and some slows the movie down a bit, especially the diner scenes, but I still would rather have it in there than not...if given only one version for a choice. Hopefully for you purists, an eventual Blu-Ray release will give us both original theatrical and extended versions and maybe some surprises. Hopefully not rotten eggs. If you have not yet tried this film, you are missing something great. Go into it open minded.. In my books, this is one of Spielburg's hidden gems.t open minded..

B0063IH60K|5.0|good app. it works really well and can really assist you in wasting time. its nice to have the option to deal a winning hand.
B0068TL23G|3.0|The concept is interesting, though I think I've played it before. Where it falls short is the implementation of states and loading screens. It will sometimes double open games or menus because it doesn't properly handle transitions. Honestly, it's something I would expect as a first time &quot;feeler&quot; app to learn the language. Still, decent game. Also, yes, it has multiple CHAPTERS of 16 levels EACH, not 16 levels total.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was the first book I have read from Nicholas Sparks and best book I have read in a long time.  The story line kept me wanting to read more, just couldn't put it down. Story was believable and it was amazing how you could see yourself right there in the town, his details were almost life like.  My only complaint is that I love to listen to books while I am crocheting but the text-to-speech was disabled and love to see that changed in the future.
0385344228|5.0|Theoretically, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  However, when a 14-year-old boy is accused of murdering a classmate, no matter what the final result, just being accused is as good as being proven guilty. The trial becomes a formality as the community around the family decides that Jacob is guilty before he even comes to trial and it is the parents' fault that he was capable of murdering another child.  Jacob's father, Andy, who tells the story, is an assistant district attorney. When Jacob is accused of murder, though, Andy is relieved of his duties and his whole life becomes defending his son, whom he believes is innocent. Painful secrets and foolish actions work to undermine the family's ability to deal with and to recover from this crisis. Learning more about each other does not necessarily draw a family closer or allow them to deal with a crisis better.  William Landay kept my attention throughout the book. I could hardly put it down, even knowing that the ending might not be as pleasant as I hoped. He keeps the emotional roller coaster going, as he details how Jacob's father does all he can to defend his son. In this novel, Landay has told a story that could apply to many fathers who, like Andy, would be willing to do whatever it takes to keep their children safe and free.

Only a couple of these takes on Dylan's songs are any good. The most interesting are Kronos Quartet's version of \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" and K'Naan doing \\"With God On Our Side.\\" Airbone Toxic Event acquit themselves well enough, and the other billion songs on here aren't worth listening to.

B005G0ETV0|4.0|The recordings of Arthur Rubinstein have been well treated on Compact Disc. Some of RCA's first CD issues of analogue recordings were devoted to Rubinstein, although the early remastering left much to be desired. (I worked at a classical record store on Cleveland's Shaker Square when a Tchaikovsky/Grieg disc was issued. The manager said it would never sell because it originated as an analogue recording - in fact all our copies sold within two days.) Most of Rubinstein's stereo recordings have received multiple CD issues, a testament to the pianist's continuing popularity with the public. The mono recordings have not had such broad distribution which has contributed to a distorted picture of the pianist's legacy. RCA's Complete Rubinstein Collection, issued as an expensive box in 1999, gathered together all of Rubinstein's recordings for RCA, HMV/EMI, and a single recording he made for Decca/London - it also contained a two CD set of interviews and previously unissued recordings. Now we have this Original Album Collection. Contained herein is everything from the 1999 box, except for the 1964 Moscow recital, which is available elsewhere on CD and DVD. This set also includes three CDs of previously unpublished live recordings (more on those later) - making for a total of over 100 hours containing a huge swath of solo, concerto, and chamber repertoire - at a fraction of the price of the 1999 box.<br /><br />With the exception of a 78RPM disc made for the Polish Favorit label in 1910 (never transfered to a modern format), Rubinstein refused to record during the pre-electric era - he complained the old acoustic recording process made the piano sound \\"like a banjo\\". So the earliest recording here was made when Rubinstein was already 41 years old. It's fascinating to trace Rubinstein's evolution as an interpreter over a 48 year period.<br /><br />In general, Rubinstein's earlier performances of shorter works, such as Chopin Mazurkas and Nocturnes, are freer and more imaginative than the later remakes. The younger Rubinstein also has greater control of pianissimo, which can clearly be heard even in the earliest recordings. Conversely, Rubinstein's sense of structure, particularly in larger scale works, improved with advancing years. The pianist's stereo remakes of Beethoven's Opp. 13, 31, No. 3, and 81a sonatas, Chopin's Op. 35 sonata, and the Brahms Op. 5 sonata, are head and shoulders above the earlier versions. The flip side is that, by the 1960s, Rubinstein had become conscious of his role as an \\"elder-statesman\\" of the piano and that he was recording \\"for posterity\\" - resulting in a loss of spontaneity. Also, his recordings from the mid-1960s onward are increasingly marred by the lack of a true pianissimo in his playing - possibly a result of deteriorating hearing. Many of the pianist's mid-period recordings, such as the Chopin Polonaises from 1951, marry the best of both worlds.<br /><br />We are doubly blessed that many of Rubinstein's best performed recordings (especially in concertos) were also made during RCA's \\"Living Stereo\\" era - when that company's recording engineers were putting out their best work. By the mid-1960s, RCA's engineers were experimenting with multiple-miking which marred his later concerto recordings, despite digital remastering<br /><br />Now to the newly issued material: These stem from the 1961 series of ten Carnegie Hall recitals given by Rubinstein (truly \\"given\\", as he donated the entire proceeds to charity). Four works are new to Rubinstein's recorded repertoire: Falla's Dance of the Miller's Wife; Debussy's L'Isle Joyeuse; Scriabin's Nocturne for the Left Hand, and Stravinsky's Petrouchka. The Scriabin is proof that Rubinstein's left-hand technique was secure, despite an inconsequential wrong note at the beginning. The Falla and Debussy have an orgiastic brio that allows one to forgive the many missing details. Performances like these must have led Harold Schonberg to write that \\"Rubinstein playedwith the great pelvic thrust\\". The Stravinsky is most interesting, as it was written expressly for Rubinstein (with the pianist's assistance) and the composer gave Rubinstein carte-blanche to make any changes he felt appropriate. The most significant change is that Rubinstein reinstates the \\"drum-roll\\" interludes between the three scenes. The Russian Dance starts out roughly, with several wrong notes and some unsteadiness, before settling down for the scene in Petrouchka's Room. In the Shrovetide Fair scene, Rubinstein throws caution to the wind and gives a full throttle, adrenaline fused performance - overwhelming in its savagery. This is the Rubinstein that music lovers over a certain age reminisce about - one never heard in the more cautious studio recordings. The remaining works have been recorded elsewhere by Rubinstein, but when performing live, the pianist was notably more flexible, poetic, and exciting than in the studio.<br /><br />The set also includes two DVDs: Rubinstein Remembered, a 1987 documentary hosted by the pianist's son, John Rubinstein; and Recital for Israel - a 1975 performance at Ambassador College in Pasadena, California. There is also a CD only version of this recital, although the playing is far from Rubinstein's best and I have no doubt the pianist would be displeased by its release.<br /><br />This set uses the best existing transfers of each recording, which in most cases means the superb 1999 remasters by Jon Samuels. A few exceptions include SACD hybrid remasters of selected Living Stereo items. Of course, the three discs of new material are newly remastered, but the source material (monaural cassette tapes owned by John Rubinstein, and RCA tapes recorded using an AMPEX noise reduction curve that flattened Rubinstein's tone), is less than optimal. Still, these remain eminently listenable. The sound in the Ambassador College DVD has been sweetened and is more palatable than previous issues - though still far from ideal.<br /><br />NOTE: After I received the set, I realized that my box was missing disc 11, had two copies of disc 13, and was lacking disc 94 (and jacket).  I checked online forums and found several others had similar experience.  I advise those who order this set to check it thoroughly to make sure the proper discs are there.<br /><br />The quality control issues prevent me from giving this a five star review.insky is most interesting, as it was written expressly for Rubinstein (with the pianist's assistance) and the composer gave Rubinstein carte-blanche to make any changes he felt appropriate.

0307959856|2.0|I am a huge fan of P. D. James- this book wasn't even close to her finely crafted mysteries.  Very disappointing- if it didn't have her signature on the cover, one would never identify this book as one of her's. Characters and plot lacking any suspense, very predictable and almost boring for James.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Woody Allen's kind of like black coffee. Either you love him or you keep a decaffeinated distance. He's never dished blockbuster helpings, which obviously implies that most moviegoers haven't taken the time to encounter him. I suspect Midnight in Paris will be an exception to the rule. If you're curious but ultimately intimidated to scoop Allen's macaroni salad onto your cinematic cafeteria plate, then Paris is a thoughtful starting point.<br /><br />Owen Wilson plays a successful yet unsatisfied go-to Hollywood scriptwriter with a Beverly Hills home and beautiful fiancée whose future business minded in-laws can't perceive his soul's ambitions apart from seven digit paychecks. So begins the films initial conflict when Wilson's only desire is to abandon scriptwriting, move into a Paris studio and polish up his first independent novel.<br /><br />Here's his handicap. Wilson's a romantic. He believes Paris' nineteen-twenties past is superior to his twenty-first century present. So begins solo late night walks, and unmistakably when the magic happens. I think most viewers will criticize his unbelieving fiancée and in-laws for not taking lamp-lit strolls with him, but Wilson's a writer. The magic, and his eventual rebirth, as proposed in Midnight, could only happen in the alleyways of his solitude.<br /><br />-Noel J Hadley

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|\\"You give your children enough money to do something, but not enough to do nothing.\\" - Matt King (George Clooney)<br /><br />Director screenwriter Alexander Payne doesn't wait until the end of his films to pellet you with plate trembling reality shifts. No sir, he doesn't let you off that easy. If you've seen the trailer for The Descendants, you basically understand most of the plot twists because Payne lays his cards on the table early on. George Clooney's estranged wife falls into a deathly coma. Clooney enlists the courage of his troubled daughters in order to reengage decayed family dynamics only to learn that his wife was committing adultery. There, I've said it. Plot ruined.<br /><br />Actually, that's where the movie begins. Payne isn't interested so much in abruptness as he is with painful realization and its curious road to resolution. As evidence, up and coming teenage actress Shailene Woodley provides a heart-wrenching performance drenched with anger from the bottom of Clooney's leaf contaminated pool. Using the alluring Hawaiian paradise to contrast his story of grief and brokenness, Clooney is burdened with the responsibility of not biting from Eden's apple, however personal and complicated its abstinence proves. Payne absorbs the screen using supporting characters quilted with composite personalities in order to deliver the complexity in the protagonist's ultimate decision for doing good.<br /><br />Films by Alexander Payne:<br /><br />The Descendants, 2011<br />Sideways, 2004<br />About Schmidt, 2002<br />Election, 1999

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Tree of Life is a massively ambitious slice of experimental cinema from filmmaker Terrence Malick that recaptures a family living in 1950's Waco, Texas, on both a molecular and cosmic scale. Attempting to microscope two overlapping paths in life, the way of nature and the way of grace, we're introduced to the father, whose relationship with his three boys alternates between affection and bullying, and their loving mother, seemingly detached from nature.<br /><br />Terrence defiantly refuses anything resembling a conventional plot line, showering us instead with photographic exposures and voice narratives brimming with transcendental beauty, utilizing the book of Job as a blueprint to undress birth, life, death, meaninglessness, and the mysterious shroud of God's measure from humanity, even taking us on an exploration of big bang origins.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Tree is misunderstood and under-appreciated. There's people out there telling you not to waste your time on this film, and they're wrong. Look, it's simple, if you think Pirates, Potter, or Transformers IS the cinematic experience, then you'll gag your way through Life. It's like nothing you've ever seen before. You can't simply watch this movie. You've got to surrender to it. You've got to let it flow over you like water.<br /><br />Noel J Hadley (200 Word Reviews)

B0059XTUMC|5.0|The Artist (2011, directed by Michel Hazanavicius)  I never expected the day would come when I'd see a new silent film in the digital age, but that's exactly what's happened, and it's wonderful. The Artist is a feel good hour-and-a-half voyage eighty-five years back in time when silent pictures, and their actors, were discarded by the wayside not only for talkies, but up-and-coming beauties to narrate them.  There's a deeper message here. Sadly, the majority of men, no matter their discipline, will likely outlive their industry; disposable parts to newer, shinier engines. It's a grim truth, but not entirely despairing. What Artist does particularly well is celebrate the grandparent form that gave us life. Whereas films nowadays use lengthy dialogues to bring viewers to speed, silent films could not, employing animal emotions, bodily narratives, and instinctual improvisation to carry the chronicle.  I imagine Hazanavicius kept his fingers crossed every step of the way, even recording in full screen format to make everything about his film feel historically genuine. My only complaint is that Artist ended on a happier note than for most actual silent actors, perhaps because this conclusion isn't projected from 1932. Perhaps Hazanavicius wants us, in 2012, to gaze, smile, and declare: They live on!  Noel J Hadley  200 Word Reviews

B004EPYZUS|4.0|What initially got me excited about this movie wasn't the fact that it's a Mission: Impossible film, though that's certainly a good starting point. Curiosity did. I like that each Mission film hand selects qualifying directors to helm continuing serials in the title series. Brad Bird is a welcome addition. Previously directing animated masterpieces The Iron Giant, Ratatouille, and The Incredibles, Bird has shown an exemplary eye for dissecting authentic human character, and by doing so, creating heartfelt drama, comedy, and perhaps most importantly, heightened peril.<br /><br />Character's an imperative element to film yet often diagnosed as the necessary evil for establishing most action moneymakers, but Bird prevails. Mission not only parades these elements, it does so in a poetic framework that exemplifies and makes you thirst for each character on screen. What I like most about the script is its comedic elements in very strenuous situations. Tom Cruise barely hanging on for life from a Dubai skyscraper and angrily disposing of his broken glove only to find it sponged on a window several stories higher, as though taunting him, brings satisfactory relief to suicidal vertigo. Jump on couches all you want, Mr. Cruise, so long as you keep them coming.<br /><br />Noel J Hadley
0071762345|5.0|I'm always wary when it comes to reading social media books and quite often debate if they'll be worth my time. But this book blew all other social media books out of the water.  Yes, I admit that some of the examples are common sense. But I think the fact that he lays them out there anyway is important. People who dive quickly into social media tend to overlook the common sense aspect of it and think only about the monetary value that it could create.  Dave is right. As a consumer and as a Social Media Coordinator, the way people respond to your products is if you can relate to them on a personal level and give them what they want. Communication is a two-way street and that's exactly what I love about what Dave writes in this book.  Suggestion: read this now. You won't regret it.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|\\"The new production needs a new swan queen. A fresh face to present to the world. But which of you can embody both swans? The white and the black?\\"<br /><br />What does it take to become a black swan? Personally, I don't have a clue since I've never seen a production of Tchaikovsky's ballet \\"Swan Lake,\\" which director Darren Aronofsky mirrors his movie from. But Natalie Portman does, executing her authority with intense passion and heroic nobility.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart, Black Swan takes an inside tour across the stage, proving alluring yet horrifying and at times grotesque.  In comes Natalie Portman as Nina, a ballerina torn between the technical perfections of abstinence, as prevailed by the white swan, and the emotional, sexual dominance that cultivates the black swan's thinking; a duo role that will only be granted to one. Introduce actress Mila Kunis, a dancer who represents not only Portman's professional competition, but the very sexual plurality that Swan Lake requires.<br /><br />What follows is a confused mix of dreamlike fantasy and puzzle-piece reality. Portman's struggle to become both swans ignites the fear of anyone who's ever dated an artist. Yeah, we're prone to insanity. It's best not to spin your head in circles trying to figure out what actually happens in the end. I suspect that's not the point of the movie. The journey there, however, is.<br /><br />Noel J Hadley
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Before comparing these to my AKG K272s (essentially a closed version), I broke these in for 100+ hours and these just did not sound nearly as good in comparison (like I was listening from behind a curtain).<br /><br />However, after another 100+ hours of playing my entire music collection, they are now sounding much better and I quite content.  The stiff new diaphram takes a long time to loosen up.<br /><br />For long term comfort, I prefer the velvet / velour earpads of my 272s over the leatherette / pleather material in these 240s so I ordered a set directly from AKG (see comments for details).  They were 39 bucks, so these may have been a better deal: [[ASIN:B0016MNBAM AKG K240MKII - AKG STUDIO STANDARD SEMI OPEN 55OHM HP]]<br /><br />The velvet earpads have made a big difference in long-term wearing comfort.<br /><br />For the same price, my Sony SA1000s also sound just as good (a bit less bass but better soundstage... more like being there listening to the orchestra live), however these AKGs have a much better build quality and will likely last years (My SA1000s lasted less than 4 years before the plastic arm broke and I have read that this is not uncommon with those headphones).
B00275EGWY|5.0|\\"There's enough bang in there to blow us all to Jesus. If I'm gonna die, I want to die comfortable.\\"<br /><br />There's plenty of good movies out there, but few of those films raise its banner to future generations as an exemplary archetype of the filmmaking art. Technical precision isn't always involved in that decision, but cultural significance is, and I believe Hurt Locker stands as one of them.<br /><br />Director Bigelow depicts James, a reckless bomb specialist who chooses to be in danger by his own accord, often defusing explosives under gunfire. He's obsessed with his work. He wants to feel what the bomb maker feels, which is almost ironic considering that the designer may be standing idly by waiting to detonate it. For him, war is a drug.<br /><br />What we have in Locker is an experience as old as civilization itself. This time it's given a twenty-first century facelift with a terrorist enemy that prefers pointless chaos over established order. Still, an entire generation of 9-11 adults signed up for it. That's the focus, I believe, of the film, the generation, not your view on President Bush's war. Locker dissects millennials with focused intensity. To future generations it declares: Say what you will about our war, but this is who we, or at least a volunteer pocket of us, were.<br /><br />Noel J Hadley

Always have, always will, everything he has ever written is over the top outrageously good.  11/22/63 is a bit of a departure for him, one that I'm so glad he took; I go willingly anywhere he wants to take me.

B005FITIK0|4.0|Matt: \\"What are you doing back in Mercury? Did you move back or...\\"<br />Mavis: \\"Of course not. Gross.\\"<br /><br />Young Adult is an uncomfortable movie. It begins uncomfortably, progresses awkwardly, and ends painfully. But that's the point of Jason Reitman's film. Reitman breaks with form to create such wondrously intrusive works as Thank You for Smoking, Juno, and Up in the Air. What Reitman delivers particularly well are intriguing characters that represent moral objections to society (a cigarette ambassador, pregnant teenager, and cold-hearted corporate professional who fires people for a living), but don't necessarily learn the lesson that you'd suspect when credits roll.<br /><br />Bring in Charlize Theron, a thirty-seven year old young adult novelist who's never outlived her teenage popularity bratty-queen self despite the fact that the rest of the world, two decades later, has. She's beautiful, but we can't stand her. What unfolds is a depiction of her continual efforts to remain youthful by possessing her past, yet how suddenly, and often, she comes undone to herself. How one person could be so arrogant of others happiness and their own misery baffles us. When the movies through, we like her even less. While not Reitman's greatest film, Young Adult may be the best critical commentary on the modern obsession with teenage literature, like Twilight, that I've ever seen.<br /><br />Films by Jason Reitman:<br /><br />Young Adult, 2011<br />Up in the Air, 2009<br />Juno, 2007<br />Thank You for Smoking, 2005<br /><br />-Noel J Hadley

A great companion to this book would be William Catton's \\"Bottleneck:Humanity's Impending Impasse\\". The two are completely unrelated on the surface. But once you peel the layers, it will all make sense.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|For those seeking a review that helps them to decide whether or not to buy this book, my short answer is don't. I'm saddened to have read this awful, awful book. Sad. I want my innocence and time back.<br /><br />I heard an NPR review of the book that glowed, and loved the idea of a sequel to the Austin novel, Pride & Prejudice; a favorite of mine. I love good writing and good stories. The Taipan novels of Clavell, the Dune novels of Hubert, the Potter stories of Rowling, the LORT series by Tolkien; intricate, well thought out, intriguing characters, absorbing plotlines, wry humor, elegant wording. Austin is a master of such stories, even though I have latent wishes for her novels. Much of the action tends to happen \\"off-stage\\" in her books and we meet only to hear it talked about. Some of her characters are frustratingly slow to learn. Still, I read and reread P&P to be entertained and entrained once again by Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />So, naturally a glowing recommendation on NPR and the prospect of a sequel to a favorite book caught my interest. Stupidly assuming it would be at least entertaining, I bought the book as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She read it, and I noticed as she did that she didn't seem impressed. Since it was a gift, she tried not to pan it to me. I quickly read it after her and came to a better understanding of her reaction to it.<br /><br />The book is awful.  Yes, its a disappointment, as some reviewers have said. P.D. James has used the Austin characters without giving them anything like the life or personality they had in the original. P.D. James laboriously restated the events of its prequel (as a matter of the fact, much of the book is a poorer retelling of the previous book) only to plug them into a boring, lifeless new plot. I haven't read any other James' books, but I understand from disappointed reviewers that her other mysteries are detailed, painstaking and gripping; none of these qualities pertained to Death Comes to Pemberley. So, yes the book disappoints expectations. Perhaps my expectations and hopes were high. I tried to consider that any sequel wasn't likely to have Austins flair or pinache, but I still hoped to spend time with my characters again. However, disappointment isn't why I'm giving this the lowest rating I'm allowed. The story is simply awful on every front, in every way. As a novel, a story, everything it fails. I imagine that I can give James only as much credit as one would give a school child for handing in a report: she finished and published a book. That's some kind of an accomplishment. But I can offer little more respect than that.<br /><br />Darcy is made out to be wimpy and relatively unintelligent. Elizabeth has lost her fire and is suddenly a helpless chick who can do little but feel and get lost in thought about times gone by. Colonel Fitzwilliam has become an a-hole. Georgiana is still sweet, smarter, but mis-used in the story, which I'll get to in a moment. Jane is Jane, thank god, but rendered impotent, even problematic by the story. Bingley is loyal but vapid, which is disappointing because you'd expect him to have grown over the years. And Pemberly, which was heaven in P&P, is suddenly besieged by a dangerous forest. That's the character problems. But all sorts of plot points get skewed or unmade as well. What seems to be a deliberate effort is made to exclude the character of Georgiana from an evening of crazy events, building tension around her significance. Then, when she reappears, and throughout the remainder of the book, she is virtually useless and unimportant. A sub-plot is introduced in which Georgiana may choose between two possible suitors, but her preference becomes quite clear in the beginning, never wavers, and the reader is not directed to want it to, ever. All sorts of attention is paid to questions of evidence in the murder, and then the trial becomes all about circumstance and character. Much ado is made of Darcy's reluctance tospeak and torture over whether or not to defend his brother in law, Wickham, then he just does it.<br /><br />As a mystery this book fails to allow the reader to try to work things out on their own. The truly great mysteries give you everything in the story that you need to understand what happened, but somehow still conceal the whole truth, usually by playing with the order in which you get it. The reveal is fun and frustrating because you know you were close to figuring it out, and suddenly realize it was all there. That's fun. It's impressive to feel the detective character was able to work it out, and the author leaves you impressed that they were able to write a gripping story while carefully diverting your attention enough to keep it a mystery to the end.<br /><br />The reveal of Death Comes to Pemberley is utterly obscure, and dull on top of it. No one's really to blame; no one is revealed to have been secretly not what they seemed; much of the truth is only introduced in the reveal so there would have been no way to figure it out beforehand, and justice doesn't appear to be served.  There's no thrill.  There's no frustrating but fun realization. I was left frowning and horrified. \\"Is that it?!\\" I exclaimed out loud to my self, and checked the last leafs of paper to see if there was any indication of more story. I couldn't believe I had been so completely let down.<br /><br />So, my frustration is partly with the author. Shame on you P.D. James. For shame.  You can not have possibly written any good books and made a name for yourself and not known how truly awful this book is. So, you phoned something in to try to get a little more money in your old age and knew perfectly well that you were publishing crap. For shame. And to involve Austin's novels in it is double-shame. One might almost think there's a secret hatred or jealousy at work. That at least would be an interesting mystery; better than your book was.  But my great concern is that this book was ever recommended by anyone. What could possibly have happened in these people's minds?  The characters weren't the characters of Austin's novel, so how could they have been entertaining to people who missed them?  The mystery wasn't mysterious, so how could it have garnered appreciation from those who thrill for a good mystery?  The book was laborious and redundant, so how could it be lauded as well written or particularly original?<br /><br />I have to conclude that my suspicion that the publishing industry has a network of fake supporters that are paid to seem like word-of-mouth is actually well in force. No one with any taste or experience in reading would consider this book worth anything better than kindling. It has to be paid talking heads or tasteless pop culture mavins that give this book any credence.<br /><br />Don't fall for it. Please, save yourself!<br /><br />I remember when I started buying Frank Herbert's son's prequels to the Dune books. After Frank Herbert died, his son supposedly discovered a vault of notes his father had made for continuing books in the series and took it upon himself, along with some other professional writer, to continue the tradition.  He chose to write a number of prequels to the original best-selling book, and I suppose eventually write later parts. I purchased and read 2 or 3 of these prequels before I gave up. I couldn't stand anymore to have these characters I loved so badly marred. I couldn't stand to have the worlds of Dune so insipidly drained of color and value. I couldn't bear the hope of an interesting plot point repeatedly failing to deliver. I wanted to remember the Dune series as it was, so I stopped reading the bad stuff, and I haven't followed what happened to the son since.  I recommend to you readers that you leave the P&P as it was.<br /><br />I've read reviews that indicate that other people have attempted sequels, and I believe that a good one is possible. Perhaps there's an interesting one out there. I wish Icould rely on reviews and professional critics to help me find one. They've clearly failed in this case. But if there is a sequel to P&P that's fun and interesting, this book isn't it.<br /><br />Hope I've been clear. Hope this helps.ple's minds?

0345522478|5.0|One of the best stories and characters to come out of Urban Fantasy. Finally, something that's not a forbidden love story for teenage females. Intelligently written. Clever, unique characters (human & other). Great for those of Celtic heritage and hippies alike. Instantly became one of my favorite authors. Atticus has the life I want.

B006QPVH6O|1.0|Gravity on the moon, not explained. Space crabs, lame. Terrible acting. There is NO action what so ever, not even an apex to the plot. Never explains how the footage made it back after they crashed. If I could I would create a class action lawsuit to get my 90min back.

1849514003|5.0|We absolutely guarantee that just about anyone will find the book worth way more than its price in time saved. To see for yourself, head over to the book's website -- [...] -- and check out the Explore The Book section for videos and explanations of the recipes in each ... and download the demo apps. Yep, the demo apps, there's free demo apps up on the store for you to check out the recipes in action: check them out at [...] and see for yourself how to *really* support a book!    Also check out the book's thread on the cocos2d-iphone forums for some subtle understated commentary like   * \\"This book looks like it is going to be a requirement in every developer's library!\\"   * \\"Ok, I have read a handful of recipes and I am completely sold. This is an awesome book.\\"   * \\"...every developer needs to have this book.\\"   * \\"this book is an absolute must for anyone developing cocos2d apps.\\"   * \\"Great book, instant buy!\\"    Gee, gushing much? But it actually does deserve all that and more. Let us take the very first recipe, \\"Drawing sprites\\". Oh for crying out loud, you think, how does that merit a recipe? Is this thing going to be full of fluff I already know? Well, no actually, that simple sounding recipe goes over drawing from files, images, textures, and frames; explains mipmapping and batch nodes; and tops it off with colorizing rectangles. Well, that is pretty good for a first recipe, isn't it now.    The first graphics chapter goes on to cover not only common drawing and animating but movie playing, particle effects, simple 3D effects, texture animation, palette swapping, screenshots, parallax, and lighting. Pretty much a worthwhile purchase already, and we're barely started!    Second chapter covers user input of varying types, including virtual joysticks, d-pads, and accelerometer; nothing too novel here, but useful time savers here if you're newish to cocos2d.    Third chapter covers data management; reading and saving plist/JSON/XML ... and even SQLite and Core Data. Probably not much completely new to you here either, but the details of working with sprites and the like are handy.    Fourth chapter is on physics and is a particularly valuable one for those of us weak on the background there; focusing on Box2D, takes you from basic setup through impulses and forces to joints, bullets, ropes, and ending up with a 2.5D isometric game engine! That's a pretty standout one there.    Fifth chapter, `Scenes and Menus', is mostly pretty straightforward but still handy code. The sliding menu grid and minimap are particularly nice.    Sixth chapter, \\"Audio\\" is another notably useful one, nice explanations of sound manipulating, positioning, metering, recording, iPod library usage, and finishing up with creating a MIDI synthesizer with MobileSynth and then speech recognition/synthesis.    Seventh chapter, \\"AI and Logic\\" is well-nigh invaluable for those without a background in it; basic waypoints, targeting, line of sight, flocking, pathfinding (the \\"in a Box2D world\\" getting special mention, good luck figuring that one out without some help!) and finishing off with discussion of Lua integration.    We figured the last chapter \\"Tips, Tools, and Ports\\" was a bit weaker; the tools picked here mostly aren't up to the currently regarded best of breed mentioned in yesterday's roundup, and the cocos2d-x and cocos3d intros were too short to really be of much use. But hey, still worth a read.    Closest thing we have to a real complaint is that you have to email the author to get the extra chapter which was omitted from the print versions; really, how hard would it be to put it as an addenda in the electronic versions most of us are going to be buying anyways? But hey, if mild inconvenience is the worst whine we can come up with, that's pretty solid.    So, yeah. We pretty much can't imagine anyone developing with cocos2d who won't find something in here well worth the price; for those just starting out it might be a bit over your head, but it would make a perfect second step after one of the introductory books or our starting recommendation --[...]/ -- so buy it now!
0439023521|3.0|Spoiler alert:  When I started reading this my first thoughts were: 'oh great, Battle Royale rip-off incoming'.  It managed to get over my apprehensions and I soon found myself enjoying this story and having an invested interest in the mostly well-written characters and bleak world.  There were some incredible moments, and some very sad ones.  The writing overall was incredible and its on that merit I'm giving Hunger Games three stars.  However, some things just felt out of place.  First off, there's Katniss.  She's the most unlikeable protagonist in the book (not that that is saying very much).  She's selfish and vindictive towards Peeta and the others. and really isn't responsible for her image.  Cinna did the legendary flaming dress, Peeta gave her that love story, Haymitch sent her the gifts, and Rue pointed out that tracker Jacker nest.  Its like everything manages to work out for her personally.  The good moments for her aren't enough of redemption.  Second off, what's with the symbolism.  Okay Collins, I get it, you don't have to name every person after food to tell me that food is important.  You don't have to give every capitol citizen a Roman name to put the whole Panem=Rome symbolism across.  Its like Collins is beating the reader over the head with an anvil.  The symbolism made the book feel artificial and a bit silly.  If I had the time I would've gone on further.  Every time Hunger Games gets into a smooth rhythm, some flaw derails it.  All in all, this book is overrated.  Good? yes.  Worthy of being number one for a year and a half? not at all.  Another, better book deserves that number one slot for a bit.

0439023521|3.0|An exciting read but lacking in depth.  I would have liked a better treatment of the politics of the Capital.  I don't really buy the children as gladiators idea, even in a distant future.  Though, one could argue that 16 is an adult in this fictional society.  The idea that these communities would allow their children to be taken without a fight, no matter how pointless, is not believable to me as a parent.  The mutts was a completely pointless addition toward the end.  I'll probably read the others since they're available to borrow from Prime for free.
B000P0J09M|1.0|I love the movie Goodfellas. What was a mistake was purchasing it from this site. That DVD barely works! Scenes stop suddenly. Other scenes do not play at all and are completely skipped over. Only a thief would sell a product this faulty!
B003MC5N28|2.0|Felt like the first half of a longer book.  I might have liked it if it weren't for the childish writing style.  It reminded me of a the way a 10-year-old tells you about his day-- \\"First this happened.  And then this happened.  And then this.  And then this.\\"  Just not really good overall.  As some of the other reviewers suggest, read 1984 or Brave New World, or countless others instead.  One might argue that this book has more of a metaphysical leaning but those concepts weren't really given the proper treatment.  The lofty ending might not have been as bad if the first 90 percent of the book weren't so matter-of-fact.
B0067QPVD2|1.0|Technically this movie is a prequel but is essentially a remake in that the same ideas are explored.  Unfortunately by trying to stick close to the original (itself a remake of an older movie), it comes across as a cheap knock off! Throw in some laughably bad CGI and you have yourself a movie that is easily forgotten...this actually put me to sleep!

0792163710|5.0|Director George Stevens is a favorite of mine going all the way back to the 1936 Astaire/Rogers \\"Swing Time\\" and one of Elizabeth Taylor's best movies from 1951, \\"A Place in the Sun.\\"  His directing career is peppered with great movies and Shane may be the best.  Shane (not sure if this is his first or last name as it's never addressed) happens upon a farm in Wyoming shortly after the Civil War ends.  He is clearly a loner but doesn't seem to have a destination, just riding.  The farmers are the Starretts, Joe (Van Heflin), Marion (Jean Arthur) and Joey (Oscar nominated Brandon De Wilde).<br /><br />As Shane is getting some water from the family, several riders come to confront Joe about moving.  The cowboy's boss wants the land for raising cattle and the Starretts and several other families have homesteaded.  Shane's presence has an effect and the cowboys back off.  Shane hires on to help the Starretts.  The young son takes a liking to Shane and his sidearm, a pearl handled .45.  Shane and Joe hit it off as well.  There is also potential entanglement between Marion and Shane but Stevens plays it cool.  As close as they get is when they are dancing at a picnic, but make no mistake there is an attraction.  I suspect this might be played differently if the film were made today.<br /><br />In any case, although the lead rancher (Emile G. Meyer) is certainly a bad guy, Stephens allows the character to in fact, have a conscious.  He and screenwriter A. B. Guthrie allow the cattleman and Joe to debate who should have ownership of the land.  After all the ranchers were there first.  History suggests that the federal government allowed homesteading in order to populate the western territories.  The rancher eventually hires a gunman (Jack Palance) to help weed out the settlers and Shane who has proven to be a thorn in the side and couldn't be bought. The film is flush with focused brawling and of course the eventual gunfight.<br /><br />\\"Shane\\" is a big picture, filled with big men, big ideas and big scenery.  Set in the valley of the Grand Tetons, the film won an Oscar for cinematography.  It was nominated for 5 others including Best Picture.  It is perhaps the best western of its day and one of my favorites.nery.  Set in the valley of the Grand Tetons, the film won an Oscar for cinematography.

0307946711|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but found that it took far too long for our characters to finally work it out together. Dexter's character was very unlikeable and took so long to get his act together and it was excruciating to read of his spiralling downfall. Emma's, in contrast was a delight, but I couldn't understand her attraction to Dexter.  The ending was what I expected, it's the only way it could have ended, but left a bit of a sour note.  I'd be interested to see how Hollywood make a complete mess of this with the movie of the book.

0312430000|4.0|The main tenet of The Checklist Manifesto is that as our lives and our jobs become ever more complex, the power of the simple checklist grows.  Citing examples from hospitals, construction, restaurants and aviation, The Checklist Manifesto is a modern-day call to arms for a return to the simple, elegant solution of the checklist in answer to the chaos and entropy of the modern world.<br /><br />In his latest book surgeon, writer and professor Atul Gawande brings his unique perspective in analyzing the role of the checklist in harnessing the complexity and the large amounts of knowledge that lead to failure in increasingly complex fields.<br /><br />Making a distinction between ignorance - we don't know how to do something, and ineptitude - we know how to do it, we just fail to apply it correctly; Gawande asserts that even after building a base of knowledge and experience, the sheer volume and complexity of the jobs we face demand, from a term borrowed from engineering, \\"forcing functions\\".<br /><br />These forcing functions are \\"relatively straightforward solutions that force the necessary behavior\\".  A checklist acting as a forcing function in the operating room could be as simple as instructing everyone to introduce themselves to each other; which research has shown makes it more likely that team members will speak up should problems arise during surgery.<br /><br />Gawande makes sure to note that the repercussions of not using checklists go beyond simple correctable mistakes.  Citing research that \\"has consistently showed that at least half our deaths and major complications are avoidable\\" following surgery, he points out succinctly that \\"we are flawed and inconstant creatures\\" and his argument for the use of checklists is not only a call to simplify the complex, but a plea for those with specific and detailed knowledge to accept the limitations of their skill.<br /><br />Gawande also looks at what makes a checklist serviceable and useful.  As he puts it, \\"In the end, a checklist is only an aid.  If it doesn't aid, it's not right.\\"  An effective checklist isn't lengthy (between 5 -9 items), is simple and exact (fitting on one page in most instances) and must be tested, revised and rewritten.<br /><br />Gawande is particular in these prescriptions as he very well knows the obstacles to get anyone, especially highly trained and highly skilled professionals to change their behavior is a lot to ask.  But after having written such an incisive, instructional and persuasive book like this he has laid the foundation for a revolution for the everyday checklist.<br /><br />This is the rare book that can change the way you think and I highly recommend it.id, it's not right.\\"  An effective checklist isn't lengthy (between 5 -9 items), is simple and exact (fitting on one page in most instances) and must be tested, revised and rewritten.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|The intense craftsmanship of Terrence Malick's beatific 2011 film is what stays in the memory far more than his storytelling skills. It's the unique product of a reclusive filmmaker ([[ASIN:B003152YXC Days of Heaven]], [[ASIN:B001JDQXCG The New World]]) who does not feel bound by traditional narrative structure or any proven Hollywood conventions beyond casting star actors like Brad Pitt and Sean Penn in pivotal roles. Malick has clearly invested thought and care into every image of this film, but achieving a tangible level of clarity around characters and plot is not nearly as big a priority to him. If viewers are willing to overcome this hurdle - and this is quite a hurdle for many viewers including myself - then one can appreciate how his meticulous approach can seize upon the deeper emotions he is trying to convey in his time-traveling tale of spiritual replenishment. Malick presents two intertwining plot threads - one revolves around Jack O'Brien, a bereft middle-aged architect who appears to be searching for a deeper meaning to his younger brother's years-ago death, the other is a mid-century flashback to his childhood in Waco, Texas, where he is raised by a nurturing mother and a taskmaster father. The parents represent two seemingly irreconcilable ends of a philosophical spectrum with the mother following the path of grace and the father the way of nature. The tragedy of their son's death deepens the chasm that the grown Jack is still trying to rectify in his life.<br /><br />Once Malick presents the situation, this is where he stops to contemplate the origin of life and evolution. This extraordinary sequence begins with a pinkish-blue glow floating in space, which transitions into bubbles of primordial ooze, life-forming amoeba, and then jellyfish. This gives way to dinosaurs (with one contemplating the fate of another on a riverbank) and a school of circling hammerhead sharks, all ending with an asteroid impacting the earth. Somehow, Malick gets away with this piece of filmmaking brio and comes back to the more immediate family story because he can bring a level of universality to the emotional turmoil brought forth by the personal tragedy. However, his grand intentions also run roughshod over the characters whose motivations remain elliptical in the scheme of his story. Toward that end, the filmmaker makes liberal use of diminutive jump cuts, three-quarter profile shots of the characters, and fantasy images to carry his story along to the strains of majestic orchestral music (courtesy of Alexandre Desplat) to evoke the presence of a higher being in their lives. He comes back to the greater existence by showing the future of the planet five billion years in the future where the earth becomes a lifeless shell orbiting around a sun that has aged into a feeble white dwarf.<br /><br />When the story itself returns to the present day, Jack appears to be traversing the Southwest canyon country and magically ends up on a beach where he finds emotional closure. The cross-pollination of reality and fantasy into a cathartic state is something Malick does with greater aplomb than most filmmakers, and it helps that he gets a solid performance from Pitt who accurately captures the prideful sensibilities of a father from that period of history down to his frustrated dreams and his buzzcut. Jessica Chastain ([[ASIN:B006IGZWB2 The Help]]), 2011's \\"It\\" girl among critically lauded actresses, has less to do as the mother since she is given barely a word of dialogue, but she provides a memorably lingering impression of repressed feelings and maternal instincts. Penn is not given that much to do either except look pained during his journey of self-discovery. Special kudos need to be given to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki ([[ASIN:B000QGAU4E Children of Men]]), who provides a vivid grandeur to all the startling visual elements no matter what eon needs to be captured by the idiosyncratic Malick. The filmmaker's hyper-sensitive attentionto cinematic detail will definitely impress cineastes, but it will confound and try the patience of the more undemanding viewer. Granted there is a fair amount of pretension and self-absorption here, but one can't help but be awestruck by the end result.will definitely impress cineastes, but it will confound and try the patience of the more undemanding viewer.

B003H9M1QM|5.0|Dumbo has never looked this good before. This is the way a blu should look, fully restored if possible.  The colors are brighter here and the picture is without cuts and tears. Disney did a great job with this one.  the movie itself is a true classic of course. It's a work of art and was made back in the terrible depression days. It can still bring wonderment to audiences because it's  a timeless film. This blu ray takes it to another level and as with all disney blu rays , the whole thing is classy and well done. (at least the animated ones that is).
0439023491|5.0|I'm reviewing the second book of suzanne collins amazing hunger games trilogy, called Catching Fire! This time only gets more intense as the book goes on.<br /><br />Once again I spent two sleepless nights reading this book. although I did sleep it was with a worried stomach unable to handle the intensity of living within the story. In a totally awesome way.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta (*sigh*) are once again are main characters. Katniss is struggling between the feelings she has for both Peeta and Gale. As well as the realization that there will never be an end to the star-crossed lovers act, she will have to eventually marry Peeta.<br /><br />Katniss is in trouble, she unknowingly started a revolution because of her defiance to the Capitol in the games. Retribution is coming, and it's worse than anyone could've possibly anticipated. In short, she's screwed. As well as those who care about her, those who want to protect and love her. She feels worthless and despicable.<br /><br />President Snow has threatened to kill the ones she loves if she cannot convince him that she really loves Peeta. This will be difficult because she must go back to the Capitol with Peeta for the Quarterly Quell, another one of the Capitol's various reminders that they are in charge.<br /><br />This book also introduces many new characters, including Finnick a hottie who won the games a few years back with a trident. At the beginning Katniss sees him as a arrogant man who uses his beauty to get secrets from unsuspecting women. However, it turns out Finnick does things for a purpose, and the only girls he truly loves is one who is mentally insane and a sweet 80-year-old.<br /><br />Personally I think it's horrible to add ANOTHER extremely attractive male to the story. Completely heartless, I mean who wants 3 handsome guys crowding up a story? Just kidding, I love them all!<br /><br />At first I was once again doubtful of this book, I knew I loved the characters but figured the plot would be predictable. However, I was once again proven wrong, this book throws twists out like nobody's business.<br /><br />I think the magic of Catching Fire comes with the amazing development of the characters. They are relatable and their conversation does not consist of, \\"Oh mother dearest, my only goal in life is to please-eth you.\\" It is realistic and the characters are just normal (in most cases) except they've been forced to grow up, and learn to kill because of extreme horrors. However, if they were given the choice, they would be the teens you see walking in your high school.<br /><br />God, this book is freaky, it literally instilling panic in my SOUL! Haha. But seriously... It gets intense and aren't those books just the best!!! The only criticism I can give is that it had a drop off ending and I hate that, but not that much. As long as there is a book following... Oh wait there is!!! Yay!<br /><br />I think the main goal of this book, other than to provide wonderful entertainment, or the fact that apocalyptic themes have diffused all over the world. It is the reminder that we must take care of our world, live life to the fullest, protect our relationships, and a reminder to be the person to say \\"stop\\" before things get too extreme.predictable.

B003F3NDWG|3.0|I love Castle, but the recording of this particur DVD was very bad.  It had wavy lines on almost every session.  I sent it back, received another one that was also bad.  I returned that one for a refund.  I still do NOT have the second season.
B003WRLLGK|4.0|I had to read The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas by John Boyne, for a book report at school but loved the story and am glad I read it. I learned to empathize and understand a lot more about how the Germans lived during the holocaust. They were not in good condition either, although better than the Jews, they still suffered from food rations and oppression; even those who worked right under him as Bruno's father did.<br /><br />My favorite character is tied between Maria and Pavel, because they are both kind and loving to Bruno. They do their best to explain to Bruno why things are the way they are and why, although he may not like what is happening he must learn to accept and live through it.<br /><br />My least favorite character is Lieutenant Kotler, he is disrespectful and cold-hearted; one of my main reasons for disliking him is because he flirts with both Gretel, who is only twelve, and also with her mother which I believe is absolutely repulsive. He also calls Bruno \\"little man\\" I can relate with Bruno about being upset with this because I hate it when people treat me like a child, or comment on my height, which was a sore spot with me when I was younger.<br /><br />The scene I most enjoyed was when Bruno fell off the tire swing and Pavel came and cleaned his wound with the utmost of care. This scene was beautiful to me because although Pavel has had everything taken away from him, his job as a doctor replaced with being a waiter, because he is Jewish; yet, Pavel is not bitter or angry at Bruno for being the Commandants son, as I would be. This is an example of the amazing ability of humans to forgive.<br /><br />Bruno got older throughout the book, and he adjusted to his life at Out-With, with Shmuel making it bearable for him. However, Bruno never lost his childlike innocence, he, like most young children, had not yet learned to hate or deeply despise anyone. He did not understand the grown-ups nonsense of some people being better than other people; I was heart-broken when he and Shmuel got gassed, it made it so real that masses of people were murdered that I was crying and angry. Although, like Pavel, we all must learn to forgive.<br /><br />Three Questions I would looooove to ask John Boyne:<br />a. Where did you get the inspiration to put a child in the Holocaust?<br />b. Was writing the book more difficult from a child's perspective?<br />c. When did you first come up with the idea to make Bruno say the words, such as Out-With and Fury, wrong; do you think it helped make the story more realistic?<br /><br />3 Book Bees<br />Originally posted at [...].ssed, it made it so real that masses of people were murdered that I was crying and angry.

184317569X|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a classic story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, one of five sisters as she unknowingly makes an arrogant Mr. Darcy fall in love with her. While her older sister, Jane, has her own troubles with Mr. Darcy's friend, Mr. Bingley.<br /><br />This is a love stories for more than one, full of marriage do's and don'ts. It is also full of wonderful dialogue and a timeless plot.<br /><br />This is one of my very favorite books. I love how everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong. My favorite part about it is that I can relate to the story although it obviously was not written in this time period.<br /><br />My favorite mix up is how Mr. Darcy is convinced that Jane does not love Mr. Bingley so he separates them, causing Elizabeth to refuse his offer of marriage. He then goes through a long process of tiny deeds with the hope of redeeming himself in Elizabeth's eyes.<br /><br />One of my favorite characters is Mrs. Bennett. Forever causing her daughters' grief with her thoughtless comments and impropriety, she contributes to much of her daughters' unhappiness; Although all she wants for them is to be well-married and happy.<br /><br />I recommend this book with a love for classics who do not get bored with a lot of dialogue (like my sisters do).<br /><br />E @ 3 Book Bees<br />Originally posted @ [...]<br />Ima swagbucks superstar @ [...]

0307959856|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book. A couple of pages into it, it was pretty clear that I wouldn't enjoy the ride. The dialogues are stilted, the atmosphere is sterile and it's sooooo predictable. Maybe in the hands of a different writer -- someone who understands to evoke the era and would be able to make the characters come alive -- the predictability wouldn't be so bad, but in its current form it's just an annoying bore.

B005HP2J66|5.0|What a DVD \\"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\\" is!  It was worth the wait as it was a pre-order.  I ordered two, one for me and one to gift to my son.  I had missed seeing this Documentary when it played at a local theater, and inquired at Amazon.  I had to order from 2 suppliers but both delivered with no hassle.  This has been my experience with Amazon since I began ordering from them years ago.  In only one instance did I have to return an item because it was not what I wanted.  In another instance I did not receive a DVD although the Postal Service claimed it delivered to my Rural Post Box.  I informed Amazon and in a few days another DVD had been dispatched to me.  Always great service.

The signed film cell strip is awesome- Thank you Michael Bay!!! This will sit proudly on my shelf and I'll be watching all the Dark of the Moon special features and the film in 3D this evening. Why there are any negative reviews for this set is beyond me. $90 is cheap for such an awesome collectors edition. This is for true fans, not haters! TF is the best franchise ever and Michael Bay has done such an amazing job on the 3D film and the extras. I just wish that Dark of the Moon was re-released in the cinema in 3D like Avatar was as I'd go loads more times. Roll on Transformers 4!!!

0143039431|5.0|I got caught shoplifting makeup when I was thirteen. I waited for my mom to come to the store after security called her, imagining the anger she'd have in her face when she saw me and feeling shame, shame, shame. I didn't cry until she walked into the office and burst into tears, herself! Then I did, too. And on the way home, as I sobbed, she said things like, \\"I know, I know,\\" and \\"Shh...\\" Then she bought me a pineapple softserve ice cream cone at a drive-thru Mexican restaurant and took me home, where I laid in bed waiting for the sound of my dad's diesel engine and my impending doom.<br /><br />I thought of that while reading this book because Ma Joad, the strongest character I've met in a Steinbeck story, would tell her kids or her husband to hush when they started doubting themselves and their choices. She'd say something like, \\"Of course you did what you could! We all did. Everybody did what they could, so hush now, and peel these potatoes. Your pa and brothers need to eat!\\" Even her son who had killed somebody (in self-defense) was given a full pardon by Ma and told to just hush up about it! Of course you didn't put shame on the family! You did yer time, now hush!<br /><br />So, scrawny Ruthie Joad goes and tells a whopper of a family secret that changes things for everybody and puts an instant fear into the whole clan, including Ma, who gets wind of it from little Winfield. And Winfield says, hopefully, \\"Gonna whup her, Ma?\\" But no. She orders everyone to be quiet about it to Ruthie and not make her feel worse than she already does. When Ruthie shows up, she runs to her ma's middle and screams and cries into her belly. Ma knew, of course. Nobody can punish a person like him or herself. Just read the book and look at Uncle John, and you'll know it, too.<br /><br />Now, this book is not historical fiction--it's fiction from history. John Steinbeck wrote this book while all of the labor injustice was happening. Effigies of Steinbeck were burned all over California in protest over this revealing saga! He grew up in Salinas, well off, but idealistic. He spent his school vacations working in fields and on farms and listening, listening, listening to people's stories. He felt love and empathy for these people. He saw it as another Civil War for our country, but this time between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots,\\" which is why he used a phrase from a Civil War ballad as his title.<br /><br />Books about injustice and upheaval make me feel so anxious because they make me look at myself. My students read books about Martin Luther King, Jr., or Rosa Parks, and they feel empowered. They say really lofty things about justice and rights and humanity and what was wrong, and what they would do. And I'm glad to hear them talk like that, but I get anxious during this sort of talk, too. I don't think I'd have been the one to stand up against anything. If I were there, I wouldn't have been picketing, facing violence! I'd have been hiding in my cabin, wishing everyone else would just go back to their cabins and work and stop causing trouble. People are likely to get their heads smashed in when they stand against power. And thank the Lord (Ma Joad's Lord, please, not Rosasharn's or Uncle John's) that there are people who will. Okay, enough about me and how I am no hero. It makes me feel squirmy.<br /><br />Though, maybe I'll find my cause. There was one thing that got to Ma Joad enough to shame her kids, and that was selfishness or self-pity. \\"It's not all about you, Rosasharn,\\" she says to her pregnant daughter. She tells her that if she were well and not with child, she'd give her a whop in the face for all that self-pity. She wanted her to understand that you can't be self-serving! You've got to give even when you've got nothing! And Rosasharn learned that lesson. I learned that she had in one of the most beautiful paragraphs I will ever read.ling saga!

B001AVCFK6|4.0|Disclaimer: I am NOT a Trekkie. I have never watched the original show, and saw maybe one of the Trek movies years ago. As such I cannot comment on the story in terms of prior Star Trek lore.  Despite my lack of knowledge in regards to the Star Trek universe, I really enjoyed this film. J.J. Abrams did a wonderful job, and the script was very well written. Chris Pine, who plays Kirk, is very charismatic and fun to watch on screen. Zachary Quinto, Spock, is also very good in his role and the chemistry he has with Pine is very apparent.  Overall it is a very good movie, even for people who are not familiar with Star Trek. And the HD picture offered by Blu-Ray is absolutely brilliant.  8/10

B005GYGCOI|2.0|Lonely Planet is happy to highlight every limit of ebooks and take advantage of none of their strengths. This ebook is not worth buying.  The book is missing essential links like, well, lets start with the Table of Contents. In theory it is there, but the table of contents contains eight items most of which are useless (I am not kidding, half of the links are...picture of the cover, how to use this book, contact us, about the authors, etc.  Even within cities, the links are terrible. In a number of cases, they actually link to the wrong item. Sometimes it jumps to another city! Did any proofread it. Obviously not, they just wanted to make more money.  The book itself is ok. Coverage of the north is good, coverage of the south is extremely sparse. A random city in the north, say Udaipor, might have 20 hotels listed. A comparable city in the south might have three. Take the City of Ooty (Udhagamanadalam). It is a trekking town (The book reads, \\"Trekking is pretty much de rigueur in Ooty and the reason most travelers come here). And then they don't recommend any guides or places to go.  This is repeated all over the south.  The guide is also pretty out of date. Prices were two to four times the listed price.  Buy the print edition or buy something else, this ebook is not worth it.

0385535139|4.0|The Litigators reads like a fairy tale to me.  No greater story then a street lawyer doing good deeds for deserving people, then being rewarded handsomely for it with a good life and financial success.  Its pure entertainment.  John Grisham is a master at character creation.  Most of these guys are stereotypical and even predictable.  Usually, I eschew such a thing, but not in this book.

This is a great tool  to toss in a backpack if you spend much time outdoors with any kind of knife, but it's also very handy around the house.  Just run the knife towards you (one direction every time) a few times, without much pressure, and the knife will be sharp.  It's that easy.  A lot of knives these days don't hold an edge for long, and this saves a lot of money because a knife can be used many times longer.

B004A8ZWY2|5.0|Once in a while, a truly magnificent movie comes along.  This is one of them.  Like any great Spielberg film, War Horse is a roller coaster ride that will take its viewers from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other.  Just like E.T. and Saving Private Ryan, this movie has the ability to make you laugh one minute and then put a lump in your throat the next.  The imagery, musical score, and cinematography are second to none.<br />  If you own a horse or love horses, this movie may be difficult to watch at times because it can be quite stirring.  As difficult as some scenes are to sit through though, I'm grateful for them and their ability to expose the cruelty that mankind has inflicted on horses.  In many ways, this movie seems to honor their contributions.  Best of all, it is one of the few movies that actually appreciates horses and portrays them as something other than veterans of the race track.  The only other movies that accomplish this are The Black Stallion and Black Beauty.<br />  War Horse does an excellent job of exposing the many horrors of war that the soldiers and horses both faced.  It has all the unique elements of World War I such as no mans land, poison gas, tanks, and machine guns.  All of which were a novelty before World War I.  Historically, this movie seems to be very accurate.  Kudos, Mr. Spielberg for doing your homework, putting your heart into this project, and delivering an exceptional movie!

0671027573|5.0|Book Review:  This was a new-author-to-me and I wish I started reading her a long time ago. What a super-freakin' fantastic book. It's filled with a gripping plot from page one. I read through most of the night, until my eyes couldn't stay focused on the words.  I seriously couldn't stop laughing--there are so many zingers in this book-while reading.  Have you ever met someone who provoked you, pushed your buttons, and was completely not what you thought at first?  That's Jaine's dilemma at the beginning of this hilarious and sexy read. Jaine Bright has just recently settled into her first home. She loves her neighbors, the tree-lined streets, and has made her house a home. There's just one catch--her neighbor is a surly, red-eyed, shabbily-clothed drunk. Or at least, she thinks he is. He is constantly banging his door at odd hours of the night, drives a hunk of metal that has seen better days, and has the nerve to complain to Jaine that she is too loud--at 2 pm in the afternoon--while he is trying to sleep. Their first conversations are pretty entertaining and you can feel the underlying tension between the two. The dialogue is witty, snarky, and spot-on for placing the reader in the actual scene.  Jaine finds out that her drunk of a neighbor, Sam Donovan is actually a cop. And he likes to drink from the OJ container in front of his fridge--butt nekked--early in the morning. Oh yeah--and Jaine's window is in perfect position to see all of his manly parts while sipping her coffee. (Whistles tune from the Maxwell House commercial, lol).  What follows is a rousing, page-turning, and jocular read that I will hold close to my heart-and on my keeper shelf.  Thank you Melissa, Rao, and Lisa Renee Jones for pointing me toward this amazing and talented author.

B003EV6DBW|5.0|As someone who started at the beginning of NewWho Season 9 and fell head over heels for David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, I refused to even entertain the possibility of liking Matt Smith. David Tennant was \\"my\\" Doctor, no ifs ands or buts! Buuut, after watching the first episode of series 5, I was hooked. Smith's Doctor and Moffat's direction, bring something new and refreshing to the show. He's a young and passionate Doctor who doesn't let the burdens of his previous regenerations weigh him down and dampen the fun he can have in this one. Add to that the fantastic dynamic between himself and Amy Pond, and eventually the tag-along Rory and everything combines to make a really fantastic show that keeps you coming back for more, devouring every in-video commentary and Doctor Who Confidential available!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I ordered this sonic screwdriver with the intention of being able to ~use~ it, but all it's done so far is light up and make the sound, which doesn't help me much at all. The other day I was at a space station and demonized ood were chasing me and my pals and I couldn't even unlock the door with it. Do you even realize how embarrassing it is to have a useless sonic? I mean, I know it doesn't do anything to wood but that's expected, and I just think this screwdriver needs a little more sonic.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This item arrived at my home swiftly along with the fact that it has all of the parts to the item that it claimed.

B000ZAY1W8|5.0|i have this book in my treasured  books, but i got this copy for a young friend of my sons. i know that this has been likened to stoicism, maybe, i'm a stoic, but even though the meditations are from another time they are so relevent today..i would not recommend sitting down and reading from cover to cover, but rather savoring it over days of reading a paragraph or two and testing out the wisdom for yourself.
B003OWVI0W|5.0|This import version of Live Evil released on July 15, 2010 is a *fantastic* way to experience a classic Miles Davis album.  At first I was skeptical that since the price is so cheap (especially for new copies) there must be something wrong with it.  I hear NOTHING wrong with this version, and in fact, maybe it's just me, but the sound quality is even better than the other versions out there.  Everything's louder, brighter, and cleaner.  Two discs that keep intact everything you've loved concerning the original edition.  Well then again, maybe not.  There's no liner notes or any additional information at all.  It's just the album cover with the 2 discs.  As for the music itself, I've always considered Live Evil one of Miles more melodic offerings (along with On the Corner) so it's a pretty easy album to get into for those who may be just learning to appreciate this unique, experimental style of early 70's electric jazz.  I find absolutely NO faults with this version.  I highly recommend it.
0307957934|5.0|When the Feds defunded the Texas super collider, Dr. Alex Hoffmann obtains a position as a physicist at CERN in Switzerland.  When he suffers a nervous breakdown, he leaves Geneva.  Alex takes with him VIXAL-4, an independent computer with the uncanny ability to self-teach at a speed that humans cannot comprehend.<br /><br />To finance his research and his machine, Alex sets up a hedge fund run by VIXAL.  The algorithm VIXAL uses takes the pulse of investors leading to four years of incredible growth while the stock markets around the world collapse.  However, as the creator loses control of his creation, someone inside the firm diligently works on making Hoffman look insane to his staff.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable modernization of Frankenstein with a touch of Harry Kellerman inside of a contemporary convergence of physics, computers and international finance.  The storyline is fast-paced with a terrific late twist although none of the cast including VIXAL is likable as all seem morally bankrupt.  With a two prong cautionary plot, Robert Harris provides a fascinating timely thriller as science without passion is dangerous while even more lethal is finance void of ethics and scruples when profit is the feral god.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000001DYA|5.0|Vincebus Eruptum is definitely one of the first straight ahead hard rock/heavy metal albums ever.  It influenced Black Sabbath and Deep Purple that's for sure.  The only negative is that it sounds really tough and dated whereas some Sabbath albums such as their debut and Paranoid in particular, do not.  It sounds dated in the production of course, but hey, on the plus side, the music actually sounds really sludgy and remarkably heavy even after all these years, and that's what makes it so cool to listen to.<br /><br />\\"Doctor Please\\" has a nice vocal melody that sets the course for the real meat and potatoes- that being the psychedelic-tinged, fuzzed out guitar solos.  They sound *awesome* and anyone who disagrees must simply have trouble appreciating the late 60's bluesy period of rock music.  I think it's fantastic stuff.  \\"Second Time Around\\" has a vocal melody that totally reminds me of the British hard rock/glam rock band Slade.  The lead singer in particular.  I love the lyrics too.  \\"I told you once, I told you twice, you better straighten up child, you better fly right\\".  Anyone who's a fan of Steppenwolf's \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\" would probably like the guitar jam.  They both have that adventurous, hazy-like quality about them.<br /><br />\\"Parchment Farm\\" has a pretty solid verse melody but what I actually admire most is the anthemic guitar solo.  Sounds pretty different from most rock albums of this time period, and that's a type of guitar style that Black Sabbath mastered on their first two albums.  Shortly after the 2-minute mark, I hear a resemblance to Cream's \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" in the chugging guitar riff.  May be a connection there that I'm not aware of.  Either way, I LOVE the bluesy guitar solo here.  It's a highlight of the entire album.  \\"Rock Me Baby\\" is a slow-paced, typically created blues track.  Not bad, but surely not a highlight.  It does speed up a little during the second half.<br /><br />\\"Out of Foucs\\" is one of the more melodically pleasing songs here.  Really snappy vocal melody in the way this line is sung- \\"Now don't somebody tell me what's wrong, tell me what's wrong with me\\".  Oh, and THIS version of \\"Summertime Blues\\" is by FAR the best version ever.  I don't even know why so many musicians bother covering it when *this* is the version we should be hearing.  The fuzziness in the guitar riffage reminds me of the Black Sabbath song \\"Tomorror's Dream\\" from their Volume 4 album.  Of course there's probably several other Black Sabbath examples I could name too.<br /><br />Overall, Blue Cheer is a great band, and Vincebus Eruptum is a great album.  An important historical album yes, but the quality of the songwriting matches the significance of the music so it's worth owning.ppy vocal melody in the way this line is sung- \\"Now don't somebody tell me what's wrong, tell me what's wrong with me\\".

0385344228|5.0|For twenty-two years, Andy Barber worked in the Middlesex County, Massachusetts Office of the District Attorney.  By 2007, he had become the first assistant district attorney reporting only to DA Lynn Canavan.  However, in April 2007, CPAC State Police report the stabbing murder of Ben Rifkin, a Newton middle school classmate of Andy's son Jacob.  Because a child is involved, which denotes media frenzy, Andy takes the lead as first prosecutor.<br /><br />However, he soon finds himself in a conflict of interest when the local police arrest Jacob.  Stunned by the accusation, Andy and his wife Laurie deny their child would commit a murder as each assumes some psychopathic child molester is the guilty party.  Jacob swears he is innocent and both believe him though the evidence overwhelmingly makes it clear that their child killed a classmate.  Andy and Laurie struggle between saving their offspring and accepting what appears to be the horrifying truth especially with other questionable deaths while his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Neil Loguidice takes over the case.<br /><br />This is taut legal thriller that grips the reader from the opening Grand Jury testimony to the stunning out of control climax.  This is a fast-paced yet extremely cerebral tale with a profound look at the conflict between what happened and justice the American way.  Readers will relish this tale as Andy, by Defending Jacob, learns that death may be a better option than the truth about himself and his loved ones.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B005VPRG10|5.0|This is Lego's newest version of the Tie Fighter. There have been a dizzying number of Tie sets: there were a few standard Tie Fighters (#7146 and #7263), Darth Vader's variant (#7150 and #8017), Tie Bomber (#4479), Tie Intercepter (#6209), and the hyper-drive equipped Tie Defender (#8087). There have been two Ultimate Collector Series (UCS) Tie Fighters: Vader's (#10175) and an Intercepter (#7181). Set 9492, introduced in January of 2012, is arguably the best of the standard, playable Tie Fighters to date. The UCS sets are in their own league as they place a premium on authenticity over playability, and carry high price tags as well. And there have been mini-scale Tie Fighters as well.  The major change with this version is the construction of the radiators, the large black hexagonal panels on each side of the craft. In addition to the usual plates, Lego has run a band of tile around the edge (a technique more commonly referred to as studs-not-on-top, or SNOT). Along with smaller detailing, the radiators are a much better representation than prior sets, and they are arguably stronger. Another change in the design evolution is the use of a new cockpit window that is more cleanly spherical. Beyond this, the design features are smaller, such as the use of side-facing roof tiles to give the craft sharper edges.  The set comes with a pilot, an imperial officer, Death Star trooper, and R5-J2 droid. The trooper's helmet is new and nicely designed, as is the droid's new conical head. The craft also has two flick-fire missiles situated underneath the cockpit dome.  In terms of playability, this set is not as interesting as Lego's new X-Wing fighter (#9493), but I believe the general thinking is that kids (or their parents) will buy the X-Wing or Millennium Falcon (7965) first, and then buy the Tie Fighter so they can stage a dogfight. In this regard, the new Tie Fighter is a great set and does an admirable job of being the bad guy. Parents, you are forewarned that, depending on the age of your children, you may be conscripted into fixing battle damaged Lego spacecraft; I think this is a fair exchange for a toy that can be built and modified. Until children learn to fix the craft on their own, it can be very frustrating for a parent, even one that loves Lego. Patience Iago, patience. Inner peace, inner peace. Find a happy place. Serenity now.  As I mention in my other Lego reviews, you can go to Youtube and search for lengthy reviews of this set. It helps to see this craft handled.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I shopped around for something that would not make my Kindle fat or bulky feeling and the Microshell Folio Cover by Marware fit the bill perfectly.

I amn very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone.

1451627289|4.0|I'll start off by saying this was my first Stephen King novel, but I plan on reading more from him.  I was initially skeptical of this book since it appeared that most of the reviews were from people born in the baby-boomer era.  Clearly, these readers have ties to this book and the Kennedy incident.  However, I wanted to give it a shot and I found it to be both a good read and informative.  I learned a lot and the novel made me wish I could take a time machine back to the 60s!  King does a great job making the reader feel connected to the characters (the 850 pages didn't hurt either).  I found myself rooting for George/Jake and intrigued to see what life would be like if Kennedy survived.  I would actually give this novel 3.5 stars but I had to choose 3 or 4 so I went 4.  My only thing is I wish King would have given us more on the aftermath and about 150 pages could have been cut.  Other then that, great book!  I hear a movie is in the works and I am looking forward to it!

B005OK722U|4.0|This is a B movie. A great one by the way. I didnt´have high expectations about this film but gave it a try. There are a lot of fake clues that keep you wondering who is really the bad guy ( and who isn´t ). This is the fun part. The rest of the film is standard Hostel plot: one friend get lost, the other ones start searching only to get butchered themselves. The trick here is to add new elements and with a limited budget I think they did decently.  My biggest complain is the ending. Too predictable and dumb. The DVD should at least have an alternative ending.  One star taking out for the ending. Yet the movie is entertaining to watch it with your loved one, a few scares to trigger a hug, nervous giggles, etc. Not Oscar material, Scream award or anything like that. It´s just another scary movie.
B000002UVX|4.0|This is the original CD release of Hendrix's `Band of Gypsys', recorded over four concerts on 31st December 1969 and 1st January 1970 at the Fillmore East. Fans of Jimi's music will know that this experimental trio replaced `Experience' members Noel Redding on bass with Jimi's ex-Army buddy Billy Cox, who had by this time been playing and rehearsing with Jimi for several months, and Mitch Mitchell on drums with Buddy Miles.<br /><br />This release differs from the more recent Sony/Hendrix family release only in that it's in a plastic jewel case instead of cardboard sleeve, and lacks the amber-and-purple square sticker on the cover: for legal reasons you can no longer buy this new, but the Sony release contains exactly the same material.<br /><br />The Fillmore concerts used some of the `Experience' numbers as time-fillers, but none of Jimi's previous recorded material appears on this album; only the new stuff. This collection has a more soulful - some say `funky' but it's not really anything like 1970s `funk' - feel to it, and both Jimi and drummer Miles share the vocal work. In contrast to the psychedelia and playfully imaginative song themes of the `Experience' years, the song lyrics on BoG lean towards the political and socially-aware. This is especially true on the star track of the album, `Machine Gun' on which Jimi actually makes the sounds of full-on 20th century warfare with his fender, as he pleads for humanity to the machine-gunner; for context to younger readers, this was during the Vietnam war which was a VERY big deal politically at the time, filling the TV news around the world night after night and inciting violent mass protests all over America.<br /><br />Buddy Miles shares the compositional credits. `Changes' became one of his best-known numbers, though without the full-on brass section used in many later renditions you have Jimi's guitar with wah-wah delivering the main theme.<br /><br />BoG was a short-lived combo, the only time Jimi played with an `all black' band (the USA in particular in the 1970s was much more politicised along black-and-white racial lines than our multi-ethnic, mixed societies allow for in the 21st century). Billy Cox however continued to record with Jimi throughout 1970, and contributed to some of his career-best material originally released on the `Cry of Love' album and now available on the excellent `First Rays of the New Rising Sun' CDs. Jimi parted company with Buddy Miles in February 1970, and Mitch with his more jazz-drummer style returned to offer rhythmic support for the remainder of his tragically short career.<br /><br />Overall BoG is essential to any Hendrix collection.

B005QJZ5FA|1.0|I found this disc at Half-Price Books for a few dollars and bought it for a listen (and to see if the many raves here are correct). Well, after three listens, the disc is now a coaster.  It is quite simply the most horrid trash I have ever heard in my life. As a boy many many years ago I used to walk past a slaughterhouse where one could hear the painful wails of the doomed animals and the low rumble of their despair...then the howls of pain.  That's what this \\"singer\\" sounds like. Maybe I am listening to a different version and the other posters here heard something else and better.  The news today said that this young lady is banging the elderly Axl Rose.  Now there's a duo I'd pay to hear.....drunk or sober!!

B0059XTUB8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I am a huge Marilyn Monroe fan. I have been a fan since I was 12, and I am 20 now. I saw this movie weeks back with my mom at the mall in Spartanburg, SC. Anyway I was very impressed with Michelle's performance and potrayal of Marilyn Monroe. All of the movies based on her including Blonde, Marilyn Monroe the Untold Story, Norma Jean and Marilyn, this is by far the best and only good and decent movie that potrays Marilyn the way she deserves to be shown. I am so sick and tired and fed up with movies potraying her as a slut or a gorgeous blonde with no brains. Michelle really manages to shine in this movie as one of the most beloved Hollywood icons and legends of all time. She manages to show the gorgeous and beautiful woman and actress the public knows and the part behind that imagine that the public and the fans were kept from discovering: the fragile woman with a sensitive soul and a fear of being abandoned and alone. Michelle really did her research and had the courage to take on such a famous and Hollywood legend like Monroe to play in this film. I know quite a bit of Marilyn Monroe fans I know on facebook are disappointed not by her performance by the film itself: claming that the affair that happens between Marilyn and Colin Clark, the assistent director of the film \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" in which Marilyn starred along with probably the most respected and talented classical actors of all time, Laurence Olivier, isn't accurate or true. The film itself is based on the book,\\"My Week With Marilyn\\" by Colin Clark himself. The film tells the story of making the prince and the showgirl and the tension between Monroe and Olivier doing the making of the film as well her one week innocent affair with Clark while her husband, Arthur Miller, is away in the USA visiting his children. After reading the book itself before the film was released in theaters and watching the documentary \\"The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me'' told by Clark's point of view I believe the possibility of an affair did take place. Most of Marilyn's friends who are still alive today think it never actually happened while her co-star, Don Murray, from \\"Bus Stop\\" thinks it may have happened. I'm not saying that the affair is true or not. All I'm saying is I think it's a possibility. Afterall, Marilyn was under tremudlous pressure while filming \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" in England while she was stressed over her recent marriage to the famed and respected playwright, Miller. She was on edge due to Laurence's behavior and attitude toward her while directing the film as well as being her co-star and the tensions in her marriage especially after finding the diary left open by her husband saying he was disappointed in her and she wasn't the angel he thought he was marrying. I think she could have found comfort and solitude in Clark and felt he could be trusted. I was very touched and moved by Michelle's performance. At times I forgot it was Michelle who was on screen and thought it was Marilyn herself. \\"All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe. When they find out I'm not her they run. Why is it that everyone I love leaves?\\" Monroe confesses to Colin in a passionate scene from the film. Marilyn could have very well said that. It sounds very much like something Marilyn would have really said. Afterall she once said,\\"I want to be loved for myself and my talent.\\" She wasn't the typical movie star in real life. Marilyn Monroe was just a fanasty and an act she performed for the camera and the public. But it eventually became a burden. \\"Fame stirs up envy.\\" And \\"Fame is fickle,\\" Marilyn Monroe once said herself. I was very pleased and excited that Michelle won the golden globe award herself for her performance in this film, an award in which Marilyn won 50 years ago. Michelle has never spoken cruel or disrespectful toward Marilyn ever in any of the interviews I've seen and always treated her with respect. She said,\\"She was a very complex person.\\" By her performance in this film you can see the Hollywood icon and legend and the real person she was in this film. I think that is the reason why I was very impressed with this film and loved it. I will definitely be buying it when it is released on DVD March 13, the day after my birthday. I was very impressed by everyone else's performance : Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, and Doughery Scott just to name a few. Kenneth mangages to do a wonderful and convincing potrayal of Laurnce Oliver and show him as the very talented actor he was as well as a vain and impatient man who had no patience with Marilyn's inability to remember her lines or deliver a perfect performance on camera on the 1st take or her obsession with the Method acting or her relibility on her drama coach, Paula Strasberg doing each take during filming. Michelle manages to show the insecure and lonely person Marilyn Monroe really was and well as her determination and dream to be taken seriously and become a dramatic actress. I rate this film 10 stars and will be watching this for a month when I finally get my hands on the DVD. Anyone who loves Marilyn Monroe and is a huge fan of hers like me should watch this film for Michelle's performance even if they are unsure of the accuracy of the film. They wont be disappointed. I wish I could see this film 2 or more times before it is released on DVD!!!! Go for it!! It would make a perfect gift for anyone who loves and is obsessed with this Hollywood icon. Definitely worth watching more then once and for years to come and to add to your Marilyn Monroe collection!!! :))
B006INDGFE|1.0|Loved the first one so we thought we would enjoy the second. WRONG. Plot is same as the first only not so funny. Full frontal nudity is getting old. Alan is mean and rude and generally unlikable. Not much to laugh about that hasn't been done before.
B002ZG981E|5.0|First of all, I was surprised when I found, besides the Blu-ray disc, also a DVD with the movie, because the product details didn't mention it. The movie in itself, it's amazing and the features are also very good. The documentaries are very interesting, specially the one called \\"Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious: Can the dream world be a fully functional parallel reality?\\", as it makes you feel that there was a very deep research on the matter before making the movie. Definitely a great purchase!
0307891372|5.0|This book is almost a must-have for hardcore Skyrim players out there.  While it's true that you can find most of what you need online through Skyrim wikis, walkthroughs, etc., I have found that this book breaks it down better than most things out on the internet.  Not to mention, I love being able to highlight the quests as I complete them, and it's a great reference guide to armor, spells, enchantments, etc.  There is also a really big map that comes with it, which I love.<br /><br />The beginning of the book also has a lot of details on how to be successful in Skyrim.  Even as a veteran Elder Scrolls player, I still found so many of these tips extremely beneficial to me in the game.  While you can get through the game without it and head to a wiki when you're stuck, I prefer having a real book next to me while I'm playing the game.  Great job by Prima!
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for and very timely delivery! I am glad that this specific item was within my budget and as a Director's Cut at that. Blade Runner was way before it's time when Ridley Scott created, the now, cult classic. Thank you!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This program works flawlessly on my Optimous LG smartphone.  Even better than the Windows program on my pc. Great for when you need to fill in some time  waiting in doctor's offices, etc.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|After seeing the movie as a \\"special\\" on television, I knew I had to get the movie. Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor are absolutely charming together on screen!!! I loved them in Down with Love and even better in Miss Potter. This is one every family household should have in their collection! Classic!! Timeless!!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Simply put, a DO NOT MISS MOVIE FOR FAMILIES......Especially those family with kids!!! Great Christian value movie for your family and your kids friends too!  An excellent off shoot for church ministries as well! Wish they made more movies like this!  I rate this movie a big 5 stars....
B00008WT5M|5.0|What can I say about these rock classics that hasnt been said already?  I love \\"Thuderstruck\\"  and \\"The Razors edge\\"
B00407PNY2|4.0|Just saw this in the last month, and it has held up pretty good over the years. The chase scene through San Francisco is still the template for all to follow. Closest to this was Gene Hackman's elevated train (el) chase in the \\"French Connection\\". \\"Bullitt\\" is not as slow-paced as \\"Connection\\" before the big event, though. Worth the moolah.

I'm quite upset I can't rate this app any lower, b/c if I could I would give it a -20!!

B0068TL23G|5.0|This game is addicting....and makes your brain exercise finding the shortest routes...  Love it!!!  Hope there are more levels to come.
B006ZS7ZLS|5.0|I really enjoy this album.  Lana Del Rey has a beautiful, mysterious sound to her voice which is complimented by the beats and sampling.  Overall it's rather unique and just a great album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I also came to the show too late, when it was gone. Thank the gods old TV shows don't go away anymore, but get packaged into DVD releases like this one. Yes, it was a group of key friends' recommendations that finally got me there. I was never comfortable with the \\"western in outer space\\" feel of the show, despite the fact I'd loved the Sean Connery movie \\"Outland\\" back in the day, and the fact that half the SF shows ever done could, in some way, be seen recast as westerns and vice-versa. I was never comfortable with FIREFLY's western motif until after seeing several episodes, after which it fit like an old glove. Maybe I needed to grow into it. In any case, that's no reason not to like something, and I rose above that slight prejudice. There's not much left to say that the three thousand plus reviews haven't already said, probably better than I can. I'll just add my stamp. I didn't come to this a huge Whedon fan, though I enjoyed many episodes of his other shows. I didn't come to this as a fan of SF, though I've loved some SF since I was a kid and loved Jules Verne and HG Wells first and Star Trek later, not to mention Philip K. Dick and Harlan Ellison. My \\"thing\\" is horror and thrillers and dark fantasy. (I write some of'em, not that it matters here.) No, I came to this based on recommendations and an ultimately open mind, and a deep appreciation for great characters, great dialogue, great acting, and great action... and, not surprisingly, the chance to find a strong message hidden beneath all those elements. FIREFLY fulfilled a lot of expectations and exceeded many. I became a fan of TV's \\"Castle\\" mostly due to Nathan Fillion (OK, and the fact that his character is a writer), and the strength of his likability there made FIREFLY a more certain gamble... and it paid off handsomely. As many have said, FIREFLY may well be one one the best television series ever, perhaps partly because of its stunted, truncated life. It left many of us \\"wanting more,\\" and in that sense it entered the realm of mythology. It's the great TV show that got away. The one the Fox let escape into its legendary status. Too bad for you, Fox. But maybe, just maybe, it protected the idea and the thematic thrust and the ensemble from ever becoming old or stale. Maybe we'll love it all the more for its rare quality, like a diamond, or a rich vein of gold. I haven't tried to describe the show -- much better descriptions are out there than what I could attempt. I tried to give you a sense of what made it special for me, seeing it so long after it had come and gone. This one belongs in all collections of television greatness. If you're on the fence, jump off and delve into this deceptive treatise on the human condition that just happens to be disguised as a \\"western in outer space.\\" Just try to feel that way after you've watched it all. Classic. And rare. I envy you, those who are about to experience it for the first time. Enjoy.<br /><br />--W.D.

B001NPDCFQ|4.0|I bought this solely because 99% of all my film collection is dark themed materials. It's a classic old time film so I can turn my brain off and just watch and remember my family watching it as when I was growing up. The transfer to HD is not as great as I would have hoped, but it's ok. One of Garland's most loved musicals, most know if they'd want this, if you haven't seen it check out some clips on youtube or elsewhere. I did find it annoying that you get a fairly nice book style case, and YET they only give you 4 song sampler disc extra? why not just include the entire soundtrack? COME ON!!! lol
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I have gone through years of the Star-Wars releases.. from VHS to recently DVD digital remastered. I waited months to check on reviews on the 2011 release in Blu-Ray.  All I can say is the video and DTS6.1 audio are fantastic for the Episodes IV-VI (the earlier movies).  The one-star reviews/complaints that 'original' theatrical release is not shown, and 'some' video editing has ruined the movie to me is purely an edited review.. not the QUALITY of the VIDEO or AUDIO.  The 'old' SWs IV-VI are like watching brand-new movies.  Maybe the complainers do not have proper Video or Audio (7.1 surround) to enjoy the new benefits of the Blu-Ray release ??  Just love it.  Of course, next will be Blu-Ray original theatrical release, then 3D.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Great application, works great on ATT Samsung Galaxy SII. Syncs with google calendar. Not sure why people don't like it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so fun! I love all the minigames but its hard to earn enough points to unlock other games. you have to replay a lot. and serpent (basically snake) is by far the hardest!
B006MQRLSA|3.0|I wanted this to be good! Brad Pitt is good in just about everything I have seen him in. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is good in mostly everything I've seen him in. I love baseball...heck, I even met Billie Beane onetime! However, it's hard for me to give it even three stars--except that if my expectations were not so high, it wouldn't have been so disappointing-so, with no expectations factored in, it was a 3 star movie.  What was wrong? The flashback scenes did not help make a connection to the character. I caught myself thinking, okay now is where I am suppose to feel sorry for Billy Beane. Nothing really happened in the flashbacks. There was never a sense that he loved baseball at all.  So why build a career in it after failing as a player?  Also, there was no sense that he loved being a GM.  They didn't really use what could have made it an awesome movie: the relationship between him and the assistant GM.  They wasted good chemistry between those two characters. There was no love for the game shown.  What was good: The thing that saves this movie is the relationship between Beane and his daughter.  Their scenes together were very touching and there were too few of them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game. my hubby is hooked. there are great games that are addicting. the suduko was a challenge which is good for me. I would difinately recommend this game. we want ti keep playing to unlock new games. that was a good idea because it makes you want to keep llaying

0439023513|3.0|Where were Suzanne Collins editors when she wrote this book? Too many loose ends. Too rushed. Characters weren't at all like they had been in the previous two books. The point that Suzanne Collins was trying to make was that war can ruin people. But, what she fails to grasp, is that although war leaves scars, it also can bring out the best of people. Courage. Strength. And hope for a better future.  This book left me empty.  I love her other books, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. But this book just doesn't fit in the trilogy.
0778328821|5.0|I just discovered the Blossom Street series and as a knitter I can relate to the characters.  This yarn shop reminds me of the one I take classes at with all the different personalities.  I really like the author's ability to bring the characters to life.  Read this quickly and have already started on the next in the series.
B005QJZ5FA|1.0|It's beyond me how anyone could listen to this drivel for more than a few seconds. Back to latest album from Bobby Messano or Joe Louis Walker; i.e., something GOOD!
0812992792|5.0|I've read some pretty good books lately, but I can't remember when I read a book that blew me away the way this one did. It's hard to say why, because a lot of it is very grim. Somehow it's the character of Jun Do, who I was rooting for from very early on despite the fact that he was doing a lot of despicable things -- which is one sign of a masterful writer. But it was also the satire, the irony, and the dark, dark humor, that helped keep the story from being too depressing.  I was also astonished by Johnson's audacity at believing he could conjure up the society of North Korea vividly enough to write a whole novel set there -- and even more by the fact that he achieved it. I went in to the book totally skeptical, but almost immediately I was caught up in the story and totally believing it. The insanity that is the real North Korea made possible the magic realist touches of total nuttiness that somehow I find harder to buy in different settings.  In a totally geeky way, I was also impressed by Johnson's \\"propaganda broadcasts,\\" which contained enough of the quality of real North Korean propaganda to make anybody who knows about North Korean propaganda laugh out loud. Just brilliantly, brilliantly done. I want to read it all over again now!
B0068TL23G|3.0|The game itself is excellent in its simplicity. The concept is simple: connect the different colored dots without overlapping. Those who are looking for a simple game to play while in the waiting room or waiting in line will love this.  Many annoyances accompany it, however. You can undo moves, but only in the order that they were played. This means that if I play move #1 and then move #2, but now I want to undo move #1, I can't do so without undoing move #2 first. Also, it can be difficult to accurately direct the lines. Finally, your previous star score (1-5 stars) is erased as soon as you re-enter a previously played level, which is quite annoying.
0525478817|5.0|A must-read. This book tugged at my heartstrings and really, really made me think. The characters are dimensional and realistic, and I got completely caught up in the plot. No other young adult author can hold a candle to John Green.  If you're thinking about buying this book, stop thinking and buy it already. You'll be glad you did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this one better than the first, which I really enjoyed as well. Most are slow starters; this was not. Quite a twist at the very beginning.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I downloaded this game because it caught my eye that it had more than 100 games all in one. games r simple but fun m addicting lol
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was my first encounter with first person, present tense POV. It took a little getting used to because I am so interested in getting into the heads of/the psychology of all the other characters. First person POV did not afford me that opportunity.However, I did find that Ms. Collins managed to get me deep into the head of Katniss. She made me indifferent to some characters while remaining standoffish to others. I think she pulled this off quite nicely. The present tense provided a more immediate feel for the situation. The tension was good. The pacing was good. I found myself not wanting to put it down, even when real life called.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this story. It is very reminiscent of Lord of the Flies and Running Man, with a hint of Romeo and Juliet. A struggle for survival. Playing a game of life or death, and only one can emerge the victor. I'm not big on the whole romance thing, though. At least it wasn't dripping in it. Not sure how that will play out in the following two books, though. But we'll see.<br /><br />The only real problem I had with the story, and it really is a minor one, is that it was too predictable. I pretty much figured everything out. Like I said, this is a minor irritant. After all, the book's intended audience is for the \\"Young Adult\\", not someone like me. The overall story, the characters, the plot, everything was rather enjoyable and I wanted to keep reading even when life got in the way. I will be reading the other two books soon enough.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is so amazing. I love the story and the characters. Keira is very beautiful and she plays Elizabeth so perfectly. The director brought the story together so beatifully. I watch this movie over and over again. Such a beautiful love story never gets boring
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This series is so different and much more compelling than any other horror-themed television show that I've ever seen. If you like Walking Dead (which I LOVE), it's like the haunted house version of that show because every single episode is so suspenseful and has so much going on that you can't wait to see the next. Every episode is like watching a mini-movie in the sense that each one is completely intriguing, suspenseful, full of story line and such quality visual effects that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Of course it takes a few episodes to get going and start piecing things together but even from the very first episode it is very creepy, gives you chills, piques your interest and leaves you hungry to see what happens next!  We don't actually have cable so we would have to wait for each episode to come up online after it aired that night. It got to the point where it was almost like an event at our house where every week we would get together with friends to watch it.  ****One thing though, you really have to start from the beginning  to understand everything that is going on. It would be hard to watch an episode here and there and still be able to know why things are happening the way that they are.  When Supernatural came out I was really excited b/c the effects/creepiness seemed like it was pretty cool but when I watched a few episodes it seemed like it was like watching a glorified Buffy The Vampire type/Teen TV show that I didn't like at all.  I am normally cheap about buying DVD's and like to get the not-too-much-worn-used versions on Amazon and things like that, but this is one of those series that I'm willing to pre-order and pay more than full price to have right away!  If you love horror movies, you just can't pass this one up!

If this problem were repaired, I would have given this app 5 stars instead of 4.

0439023483|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read! The entire book is excessively violent. The prose is leaden. Every other sentence spoken by Katniss has at least one 'I.' The characters are cliches: no real development: Katniss' mother and sister Prim have blond hair and blue eyes. Katniss and Gale have black hair and eyes. The rest of their faces? Who knows? The only sympathetic character is the boy Peeta who never wavers in his love for Katniss. She, for her part, just does what she wants, playing both sides of the coin to survive. This is all she cares about besides her sister Prim. Caring for family is not bravery, it's an extension for Katniss' survival instinct. She'll act like she cares about Peeta, then changes her opinions constantly. The dialog gets tedious with the constant talk of food and clothing. When the final 3 get to the Golden Cornucopia, wolflike creatures attack them. They have the eyes of the dead tributes. How did this happen? No explanation. The contest over, everyone goes home to starvation, with the exception of the winners who will live in luxury. The next year they have to participate again as aides. They'll do this over and over again. What have we learned from this book? That violence and inhumaity are our basic natures? We come away brutalized, just like the Hunger Games winners.
0425238091|1.0|I must say hat I had much higher hopes for the book. I enjoy reading medical based literature, since I am in medicine myself. I did all I could to get myself through the first chapter, luckily it was short. The baseness of the book was disgusting. How anyone could write of having a sexual orgy during a code, in full light of everyone in the room was beyond me. If any institution was to have anything of the sort going on I would mandate and petition for its immediate closure. The title of the book only makes the issue worse. I would recommend the book for burning, or cleaning up bird droppings, but not much more.

B006OFN0BQ|5.0|Clint Eastwood's latest masterpiece covers the highs and lows of J Edgar Hoover's rise to power. Clint has been on a serious roll for several years now. And we can add this film towards the top of his directing resume. There is so much ground to cover in J Edgar's life and career its impossible to cover everything. This is where many people feel this film came up short. Well for over 2 hours, Mr. Eastwood has crafted an entertaining look at a complex figure in our nations history. There are some areas that he chose not to explore too deeply - and that was probably a wise move.  J Edgar's career is not the only focus in the film. His relationships with his mother as well as his number 2 man- Clyde Tolson are also part of the fabric of this film. He is so close to his mother and values her opinions that he lives with her for much of his younger years. And you can sense that when the time comes when he will be without his mother, it will be very difficult on Edgar. He also developes a very close relationship with his number 2 man. This relationship is put to the test in several scenes, as both men struggle with their feelings. Mr.Toloson, although questioned by Edgar about his loyalty is always there for Edgar. He loves Edgar very deeply and the feeling is mutual. But Mr.Tolson's feelings run a little deeper and exposes this more when Edgar mentions that he wants to marry a woman. Its one of the more powerful scenes in the movie.  The film follows Edgar from his early investigations into communist radicals in the 1919/1920 era until the Nixon administration comes to Washington. In the early days Edgar has many new ideas that he has to put into place to make the bureau stronger and able to conduct the type of work that he feels is right to get the job done. There is opposition. His ideals and suggestions meet resistance. But in the end ideas like finger printing and crime lab work win out. When America cheers on the mobsters on the big screen, Edgar is trying to end their rein on the streets. In his mind he is making all the arrests and he adores the attention of cleaning the streets of thugs. But is this reality? The Lindberg kidnapping is covered very well here. Where the crime scene and evidence from the crime scene showcase Edgar's beliefs in solving cases. The cops appear to be sloppy and often overlook key pieces of evidience. The film follows Edgar through the Kennedy era and civil rights with Dr.King. There certainly wouldn't be enough time in a movie like this to explore everything. But the events are touched on with the right amount of attention for each moment in history.  This is Leonardo Dicaprio's finest acting performance. I haven't seen every one of his films, but I have seen almost all of them. He plays this role so well and with conviction. I can think of no other actor that could have done a better job. This isn't just a role about a man in a particular time period. He has to play Edgar through several decades. And he pulls this off quite well. I was very impressed with him in this movie.  Armie Hammer is also excellent as Clyde Tolson. Another great performance that won't be forgotten. I felt like his performance was very strong as Mr.Tolson was in his declining years. He played the part of a frail man with a stroke very well. He had the mannerisms down for this type of decline. Naomi Watts does a nice job as Mr.Hoover's secretary. She devotes her life to the bureaus work and has to put up with Edgar's decisions in sometimes difficult circumstances. And like Mr.Tolson, Miss Gandy is reliable in every situation- especially the end. And the makeup for this film was great. They did a stellar job of creating these characters as they age through the years.  I give this  4 1/2 stars. It would be great to have seen a little more, but most people wouldn't enjoy a movie much longer than this one. Edgar held secret files on presidents and other powerful figures- and for over 2 hours our minds were entertained  The BLu Ray also comes with a nice little feature on J Edgar the man from those involved with the film. Eastwood, Dicaprio and several others comment on the different sides to J Edgar- good and bad. And what his place in history might have been if things were different. Definately worth checking out.

030788743X|5.0|I typically read a book or two per week, but I devoured this in one day.  I love the details that saturated every page, from 80's trivia to the online world he created.  I can't recommend this book enough.  But the plot stands on its own, and I think readers of any genre would be happy they picked this book up.
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|\\"The Final Cut\\" was a decent album but I didn't care too much for the slow, depressing sound. There was some talented songwriting throughout and it showed a lot of maturity in their music. However, I didn't get the same enjoyment from it like I did from \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Animals\\". Roger Waters' departure changed the band a lot and the songwriting isn't as good but David Gilmour does a decent job writing the songs. I find it highly superior to \\"The Final Cut\\" musically. I really enjoy the late '80s sound of the songs, Learning To Fly is a classic and one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs. Overall, it's one of the most underrated albums of all time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an amazing book that I picked up back in high school. I've since reread it twice and each time I feel like I take more from the book than the time before. It is a highly recommended book for everyone to read. Ender will get in your head and force you to test your morals and explore the extent of the human need to survive.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|Why on earth cast Streep when the great Judi Dench would have been perfect?  Or Helen Mirren?  While British actors do a wonderful job on pretty much any subject they tackle, American actors and filmmakers nearly always do horrible work on any foreign project.  Were I British I'd be madder than a mashed cat over this portrayal of Thatcher, whether I liked her or not.  Just a note to say I remember the Thatcher years not just for the reasons mentioned in other reviews, but because they also dovetail with the Ronald Reagan years.  Apparently folks here in the States prefer not to remember some of the facts about Reagan, while creating this mythological delirious idolatry of a man who was at best a \\"B\\" actor who could not add. He could, however, look the part of the all-American archtypical hero of the day, deliver a great speech, and did have a gorgeous speaking voice. He also had a bitch on wheels for a wife who spent money like a drunken sailor on shore leave for designer clothes, real jewelry along with other luxuries, all for the good of the taxpayers I'm sure.  What most Reagan devotees really like to avoid discussing is his very close relationship with Lew Wasserman, the last Hollywood mogul. Lew Wasserman (allegedly) started out as a Chicago mobster, was successful enough to move onto New York, and then became enthralled with the movie business. He acquired MCA (Music Corp. of America,) hooked up with Jules Stein and headed for Hollywood, CA. MCA was the most powerful talent agency of it's time mostly in music, but it did manage two actors - Hattie McDaniel, Oscar winning actress of Gone With the Wind, and Ronald Reagan. Wasserman went on to become a legend creating Universal City and so forth. He also created Ronald Reagan. Clearly not going anywhere as an actor, Wasserman cleverly \\"promoted\\" him as President of the Screen Actors Guild (the union for actors,) then Governor of California for 8 years (what a mess - put my home state straight away into bankruptcy,) then President of the U.S. for 8 years (same story only worse.)  Ronald Reagan was (allegedly) a charming empty suit who received many sweetheart deals from the very powerful film industry, and gave back in return from the very powerful positions he attained.  The Thatcher/Reagan match was obviously one made in heaven for both. Reagan turned the Republican Party into a mecca for religious fanatics, bigots, and racists, throwing separation of church and state out the window; deregulated lending institutions; and pretended to overthrow communist Russia, among so many, many other things noteworthy for their disasterous effects like chucking the gold standard out the window and bankrupting the U.S. too.  I would not watch anything about Thatcher or Reagan. Living through the years they presided was more than enough. Who wants to relive that?  And I am sick to death of Streep and her imitations and stupid accents. It is embarrassing to have an actress with that much money always appear on award shows looking like a homeless frump. She works with the greatest costumers in the world. Get one, or take a hard look in a mirror and get help.

B003DZX3SA|1.0|I ended up trying two different [[ASIN:B003DZX3SA Beauty and the Beast]] discs (purchased directly through Amazon, and definitely the real Disney article) and found a serious play flaw in the same spot in each. Each disc cut off the end of the same scene when watched in \\"original theatrical release\\" mode. When we tried \\"extended release\\" mode, they finished the scene, but then jumped back to the beginning of the movie! Amazon was great to deal with re: replacement/returns, but when I asked about maybe trying a different lot, Amazon's answer was that only option open to me was to try purchasing through someone else. Buyer beware! There are a bunch of other versions available, so don't bother with this one.

B000068TPN|1.0|Colonel Moore wasn't stupid enough to stand in plain sight while the NVA fired rounds at him.<br /><br />Even worse was the bogus charge up the hill at the end.  Charlie didn't stand and fight, he faded away.  Any charge up the hill, with guns blazing would have found no one at the top.  This was pure old wave-the-flag crap for the benefit of people who will never hear a shot fired in anger.<br /><br />Want to feel your hair stand on end? Buy the book by Hal Moore and Joe Galloway.  There's so much more heroism and pathos in that book than you'll ever find in this crummy rah-rah film<br /><br />The best part about reading the book?  YOU'RE in the book.  Mel Gibson is in the movie.<br /><br />The movie makers took about 50 pages out of the book (which was written by the commander of the troops and a reporter who had made his way to the LZ against orders) and made some crap film.<br />You don't see the soldier who played dead while an NVA used his body as a rifle support while shooting at Americans.  In the movie, that guy would have jumped up and killed the NVA soldier with a shoelace.  The book is REAL.  The movie is fiction.<br /><br />Get the book.  You'll never regret it.

The DVD version is wonderful as the sound in DTS and Dolby 5.1 with the addition of videos of the day, meeting the fans.

How come it's after the 77 year old songwriter, intent on harming the gracious and self deprecating old fellow?<br /><br />We never learn. Perhaps this is a merciful thing...<br /><br />Over the course of his lifetime Cohen's ever more gravelly baritone has at times been the voice of the prophet, the muse, the lecher, the lover, the poet, the madman and oftentimes, the priest. All are represented in Old Ideas, a remarkable new collection of songs by the master.<br /><br />This is a starkly existential album. It traces a thin line along the edge of an abyss. But even as it does so, it holds out the hope of redemption and the promise of restoration - a coming out of the darkness and into the light.<br /><br />Darkness is one song I just can't get out of my mind. It's a taut and sinister twelve bar that's at any moment ready to snap. The tension is unbelievable:<br /><br />I caught the darkness<br />It was drinking from your cup<br />I caught the darkness<br />Drinking from your cup<br />I said, \\"Is this contagious?\\"<br />You said, \\"Just drink it up.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile Leonard finger picks insistently, Neil Larsen weaves a haunting refrain on the Hammond B3, and when Sharon Robinson and the Webb Sisters kick in with a vocal of urgent and barely restrained desire it makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />How about this from Different Sides:<br /><br />I to my side call the meek and the mild<br />You to your side call the Word<br />By virtue of suffering I claim to have won<br />You claim to have never been heard<br /><br />Both of us say there are laws to obey<br />But frankly I don't like your tone<br />You want to change the way I make love<br />I want to leave it alone<br /><br />The production of this album is exceptional.

B0053VKP8S|2.0|My new JVC LCD/LED TV has only a digital coaxial audio output. I bought this converter hoping to convert this digital audio signal to analog to connect to my surround sound system. All I got through my speakers was a click click click sound. I called JVC and they said to buy an adapter cable with a mini stereo headphone connector on one end and RCA type left and right audio connectors on the other end.  This JVC TV has a headphone receptacle. THE ADAPTER CABLE DID THE JOB. Great sound with no conversion needed. Apparently the type of digital audio coming out of this TV is not compatible with this FiiO converter.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Case works very well at protecting our Voyager Pro HD headsets.  My wife is hard on her headsets, they usually die a quick death going into and out of her purse.  This case fixed the problem and she likes the fit and performance of the VP HD headset.  Two home run products!  Arrived as advertised and they seem to be very well made.  No sign of poor workmanship or early wear.  Definitely recommend this case.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|One of my biggest concerns with the Fire was that it might be too heavy, so I wanted to be sure to purchase the most lightweight cover I could for it.  This cover is so thin that it almost looks like it's part of the Fire, yet it provides enough protection for it that I'm not worried that something will fall on it and crack the screen.  The stand works just fine, but since the material is so thin you have to be sure you are situated and pretty much stay that way or it will collapse.<br /><br />If you keep your Fire at home I think this cover will be just fine, but if you carry it around in your purse or a case you might want something more substantial.  But, for my purposes it's just perfect.<br /><br />3/21/12 Update:  I found that I was using my Fire more and more to watch videos, and this case just does not work well as a stand because it kept falling over on it's own.  If you want a case that is useful as a stand, you might want to check out something else.
0920668372|5.0|When I first read this book at the bookstore, I really liked it but didn't buy it.  I couldn't get it out of my mind and soon returned and purchased it.  I too thought it was very moving, and when I read it with my husband we both began crying.  We have an almost two year-old, who resembles the tot on the cover.  He's beginning to act a lot like him as well.  Bottom line:  No book I have read has come as close to showing the mother-son bond.
0385342063|5.0|Reading this book was a pure delight!  This is a fairy tale that will make one double over in laughter sometimes and make one try to swallow the lump in her throat at others.  In the tradition of Kinsella's heroine in her Shopaholic series, Poppy Wyatt gets herself in the craziest predicaments that have the reader squirming with discomfort.  The book opens with Poppy losing her engagement ring at her bridal shower.  On her way out, her cell phone is stolen.  She happens to find a cell phone in a trash can and starts using it as a contact number while she tracks down her engagement ring.  The phone belongs to the personal assistant of Sam Roxton, a dashing single businessman who is embroiled in a corporate fiasco.  He lets Poppy continue to use the phone while she prepares for her imminent wedding and searches for her ring.  Of course, Poppy cannot help snooping into the texts and voicemails that come through to Sam via his personal assistant's phone.  The situation becomes a madcap mess when Poppy's fiance turns out to be much different than he appears and the whole corporate intrigue explodes.    The characters are rich and dynamic.  Even with the romantic plot, no part of the story feels forced or too formulaic.  This was truly a fun romantic caper!

I'm honestly thrilled that we have two amazing groups putting out music no one else is.<br />If you want the drama from both sides there's no shortage of it online.<br />It makes an interesting if somewhat immature read to say the least.<br />I had just read about Chicken lately and decided to buy the new album.<br />I still haven't gotten the first album but I will shortly.<br />And.............<br />Sammy?<br />Anthony?<br />Satch?<br />Chile drummer?<br />OH YEAH!!!<br />If you loved Hagar era Halen this is the album for you.<br />I'm mostly a death metal head and have been since I was about 14 years old.<br />Once in a while it's so refreshing to take a break from the growling and the screaming and just hear some awesome rock.<br />Anthony's vocals are in top form as are Hagar's.<br />Satch brings the shred like only he can. Epic but with restraint. Flashy without being a showoff.<br />Solid drums lay an excellent background.<br />Anthony's bass completes the awesome.<br />Every song on here is good but my faves are.<br />\\"Alright Alright\\"<br />\\"Different Devil\\"<br />\\"Come Closer\\"<br />\\"Three and a Half Letters\\"..........Sammy smokes on this one.<br />\\"Big Foot\\".......if you're not dancing in your chair you better check your pulse........you're not alive.<br />\\"Something Going Wrong\\"<br /><br />And the packaging is brilliant.<br />Seldom do 3d glasses work but they made buying the physical CD totally worth it.<br />Brilliant.<br />Highly recommended.
B0059XTUMC|5.0|I don't know if \\"The Artist\\" is the best movie of 2011 but it is certainly the most charming, original and unexpected. To make in 2011, in the age of the breathtaking and jaw-dropping video possibilities, sound techniques and rapidly becoming the common place 3D, the authentically looking and feeling black and white SILENT movie just like they made them back in 1927, it takes guts, talent, and deep and tender love and admiration for above mentioned movies. It takes the director/writer who not only had a dream of bringing the long gone era of cinema's adolescence on big screen but made his dream come true. It takes two basically unknown to the American audiences French actors who were splendid as the stars of the silent pictures in the silent picture (Jean Dujardin and B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo). They were helped by John Goodman, James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle, and Malcolm McDowell). Let's not forget one special four-legged artist (or there were three of them?) - the cutest, smartest, and most loyal dog that ever graced the screen.<br /><br />I wanted to see the film since I first read about and I expected to like it but I did not expect it to be not only technically perfect and very funny but also melodramatic in the best, sadly almost lost now, meaning of the word. I expected more lighthearted comedy but it is more tragic comedy. It is easy to overdo the melodrama but it never happened with The Artist. It is beautiful, romantic, funny, and spectacular. Jean Dujardin and B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo are the best silent era couple on screen since well.. the end of the silent era.<br /><br />As I am writing, \\"The Artist\\" is one of the major contenders for the Best Picture of the year Oscar having received already the awards from many prestigious organizations and made the countless critics list. Ironically, in the case of \\"The Artist\\" to be noticed and heard meant to go completely silent. Is it not miraculous? Another observation - language of cinema is truly international: one of the sweetest love letters to the Hollywood early years is created by a European director, French Michel Hazanavicius. His film speaks the native film language that involves the images, gestures, eyes, faces, and most importantly - the soul to perfection. It speaks clearly and loudly to movie lovers everywhere. \\"The Artist\\" is artistique, fantastique, magnifique, et tr&egrave;s charmant.love letters to the Hollywood early years is created by a European director, French Michel Hazanavicius.

B003VS0CXS|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent.  I can not come up with any complaints at all about it.  It looks like a brand new movie shot digiatlly, even better than some I have seen.  It was presented in 2.20:1 aspect ratio, so it wasn't as wide as the normal 2.35:1 widescreen, but still had narrow black bars at the top and bottom.  I feel like I'm missing part of the movie anytime the video isn't wider than my widescreen LCD.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray has DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio, but there were almost no surround sounds.  At the beginning, before the video was visible, there were race car sounds coming from the rear and side surround speakers (as well as the fronts).  I'm not even sure if this was part of the original movie.  But this beginning was the only real noticable surround sound (I did notice a little sound from the side surrounds, but not much).  So, I really don't understand why they made this in 7.1, since 99% of the sound comes from the fronts and center speakers.<br /><br />The movie lasted two hours and 24 minutes, which included the intermission.  I don't know why they have an intermission, since you can pause the movie any time you want.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My husband and I have 4 children, and 2 months ago decided that instead of just \\"saying\\" we are Christians, we really need to walk with the Lord and live by his word. With that said, we started buying Christian movies to watch with the kids and this was our first one. Such a wonderful message that brought me to tears throughout the whole thing! I even had to leave the room so my kids didn't see me crying so much. I have given this movie to my grandparents, who have passed on to my aunt, who has passed on to my cousins ... and I am going to buy them for all the dads and grandpas in our family. My kids loved this too ... of course ... they are police men! I have 3 boys. My daughter was just as emotional as I was :) Great movie.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I did quite a bit of research on Amazon, went to Best Buy and tried several cases, but this one is perfect.  It fits the Kindle perfectly and protects the glass front very well.  It has a nice elastic strap that keeps the cover closed when not in use and can also serve as a great way to hold the Kindle when reading.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend it.

B004NROYUI|5.0|I have had this case for about 4 months now. It is a great case. It looks fabulous, fits the camera like a glove, and is well made. Particularly nice is the way that the case opens - it has magnetic clasps that allow the case to be securely closed yet open quickly. It also does its work in protecting the camera. I have tossed the camera (in the case) in my suitcase or backpack on numerous occasions and it does the job. I also have used the shoulder strap as intended, carrying around the camera on day hikes and excursions about town and it is functional and comfortable.  I'm not sure what other reviewers who gave this case a low rating were expecting - it looks just like the picture, is well made, and does what it says it does. You'll have to decide for yourself if this case is worth the money (it is not cheap - though I've noticed the price keeps falling). However, part of the fun of the X100 is that it is such a great conversation starter and this case adds to that effect.

0439023521|5.0|This book reminded my of why I grew up loving to read. By no mean is it great literature, but it's fun and I was able to get great mental pictures of their world. I could actually see my fourteen-year-old self in the arena and imagine how I'd have stacked up. I couldn't put it down until I knew what happened to Katniss. If you're over the age of 20 remember that this is a book for teenagers and let the teenager inside enjoy it.

I love the audio versions as well. could use a better topic search and topic suggestion search. ex. &quot;what does the Bible say about...&quot; unless its in there and  I haven't seen it .... I probably missed it completely. I'm just writing blindly to be honest. ok God bless.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Finally another Fire Maple game. If you loved The Secret of Grisly Manor, you'll love this one too! This one is longer and a bit more challenging.  I did have some trouble finding one of the items and it ended up being in a different spot than what the walk through said. Still fun! Keep these coming!
B003ASLJO0|4.0|Loved seeing this movie in the theaters, and though I bought it as a gift for my significant other, I'm sure I'll be watching it too!  It was a great deal, can't beat it.
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|The original \\"Hangover\\" was hilarious. \\"Hangover Part II\\" got only a couple of giggles. I give it a disappointing 2 giggles.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Really enjoyed seeing this in theaters, and had to get it when I saw it on sale on Amazon!  Now I just have to see the second one!
B000B8QF14|5.0|I bought this over the summer, and I actually just got around to review it ^^; Anyway, It arrived quickly and within the expected time. I love the DVD and CD, it is a must have for any devoted Green Day fan, I myself have watched it more than 5 times :)
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is one of Sandra Bullock's best, in my opinion.  A really great movie to watch, uplifting with a good message.  Glad I snapped this one up :)
B004T4LUPW|5.0|totally worth the price. I use it daily to track work and personal appointments, and keep all my to-do lists organized. nothing else like it out there.
B006FTCH2E|4.0|We've all behaved recklessly at times. If the result of this behavior is not bad, one remains untarnished. If the result is, as luck would have it, terrible, the fault is one's own. Luck plays this role in determining our moral fates. This film explores \\"there, but for fortune, go I\\" under the genre of science fiction. The concept of moral luck is simple, and so is this story. The acting and script are just fine. The reference to Oedipus is a bonus offered on the side.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Just what the doctor ordered. nicer than it looks on screen.  the fit and quality is very good. Highly recommended to my friends and whoever wants that up to date cool look.
0525478817|5.0|I've never wanted to be friends with the characters from a book more. John Green outdid himself with this beautiful work of art. Each person is vividly described, the dialogue flows smoothly, the plot development doesn't blindside you at any point and is easy to follow. This is my favorite book I've read thus far. The Fault in Our Stars made me laugh and cry. Read this book.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|The game is really fun and it works great on my kindle fire.But I don't understand the new challenge part of it.Oh well I do recommend people buying this game really fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is by far my favorite app that I have on my kindle fire. I catch myself playing it ALL THE TIME. I even sneak it during school :)
B005T87QCI|4.0|the game looks great but it would be better if it had were you could build your own robots and also more from the movie
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has so many differrent games, and so many varieties. If you are bored, just find a game you like, there must be a few you like. Collecting is fun also, so this game, or many game package is awesome.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I loved this book and the whole series!!! The Uglies is full of adventure and is definitely a page turner. If you liked the Hunger Games, you'll enjoy this series!
1594744769|3.0|There once was a day that even when a book was part of a sequel, there would still be an ending that felt somewhat resolved. . . This book had an interesting concept. The pictures were interesting to look at. But, at the same time, sometimes the book felt like the author was just trying to add characters that he had cool pictures of. I appreciate the creativity of the \\"real\\" pictures being used. But I wanted to feel more that he wrote the story and just happened to find some interesting pictures that added to the story, instead of the other way around. It also annoys me when there is bad language in a YA book which is just not necessary. I really wanted to like this book. I'd heard so many good things about it. But in the end it was just a disappointment.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Fantastic movie.  I am not a movie goer or watcher, but Courageous more than held my interest.  My husband will NOT watch a \\"chick flick\\".  On the way home from the theater, he told me to buy at least 2 copies and loan them to friends.  A few week later at our breakfast group we were discussing Courageous, a couple of men with us who work as undercover cops or policemen, said that gun fight scene was totally realistic.  Our favorite scene was the one in the back seat of the police car.
159514188X|1.0|I kept waiting for something to HAPPEN!  I kept thinking \\"OK...Hannah witnessed some awful things...but what was bad enough for her to commit suicide?!\\"  Yep, high school is tough.  Life is tough.  Hannah needed to SUCK IT UP AND DEAL!!!  What a whiner!  I forced myself to finish the book even though I'd pretty much decided half way through that NOTHING would happen to warrant what Hannah did to herself.  Poor, Poor Hannah.  All of these people did so many horrible things to her.  It's always somebody elses fault.  Welcome to life, Sistah.  Shrug it off, do the right thing, and move on with your life.  Or not ........
0307352145|4.0|I finished reading Susan Cain's book Quiet. For me it was a worthwhile purchase and I have some new insights on introversion. I see from the reviews that some readers were expecting a more definitive handling of the topic, but since there seems to be more we can learn about introversion/extroversion that seems like a bit much to expect. I would say that if you are passingly familiar with introversion or want to know more or to better understand the introverts in your life then this is the book for you. If you are someone constantly pouring through Psychology Today, reading reasearch papers and the like, well then maybe not so much.  I found much value in the things she had to say about embracing our tendencies rather than repress them, though reminding us there are times that we temporarily may need to switch over into extroversion. I am fine with that because there are certainly times that extroverts could use to tone it down and act more like an introvert. Personally I liked when she discussed, in business settings at least, that extroverts seem to gravitate toward more competitive people and that introverts gravitate more toward collaborative types. Also that if an extrovert seems combative that often it is because they are passionate about the topic at hand and isn't anything personal just a way of expressing themselves. I readily admit this may be more obvious to others, but she really made me think about what she was saying and I can see that my not understanding this has caused me grief sometimes in my career.  I could have done without the political bias in the book. Authors are supposed to consider their audience and the topic appeals to more than just liberal leaning readers. To me it seems like she lost an opportunity to better connect with ALL of her readers by indulging that. I have to agree with many reviewers that she could have tightened up how she organized her content, some of it does seem like rambling. It's such an interesting topic, though, thatthis wasn't a showstopper for me.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|As if the housing mortgage dilemma isn't enough of a bummer, here come the vampires to further sabotage the property values. A pervading sense of isolation informs the opening moments of FRIGHT NIGHT as the camera sweeps into a shot of a desolate Vegas suburban sprawl entirely surrounded by desert. It's an unsettling image. It sets you up for the terrifying stuff later on.<br /><br />This is a neighborhood in which blackened or boarded up windows are common sights, what with foreclosing as the new norm (hey, thanks, economy) and many residents in the community who tend to work night shifts and sleep during the day. So what's another house with darkened windows? Teenager Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) doesn't think twice of his new next-door-neighbor, Jerry Dandrige (Colin Farrell), who keeps strange hours and has unsightly dumpsters and debris decorating his lawn. But then people start vanishing, and it's at this point that Charley's estranged nerd chum, Ed Lee (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), begins accusing Charley's charming new neighbor of being a vampire. All of a sudden, Charley, who always did stress out too much, has a new thing to worry about. Especially since Jerry seems to be eyeing his single mom (Toni Collette) and his hot girlfriend (Imogen Poots).<br /><br />Let us not talk falsely now. This remake doesn't hold a candle to the original. Yep, I'm one of them what loves the 1985 version, and so the most telling points for me are that this, er, revamp dispenses with the original's more subtle touches and that Tennant's Peter Vincent doesn't have as many showcase moments as did McDowall's Peter Vincent. And there are several missed opportunities, I think. Sin City itself, Las Vegas, for instance, could've been featured more prominently as a secondary character, that old den of decadence. I can't think of any other place so well suited for vampires. In that sequence in Peter Vincent's posh apartment which has Charley and Amy fighting for their lives, it's practically wasteful how Peter Vincent's collection of vampire-slaying paraphernalia wasn't employed near enough in taking out the undead. And Jerry, our 400-year-old monster, does seem to have an odd way of keeping a low profile. He's supposed to be trying to blend in. What he does after the Brewsters wouldn't invite him in is pretty over the top and something that's bound to attract glaring attention. So that didn't make sense.<br /><br />But those are the quibbles. What are the good bits? I thought the acting was solid all across, although Yelchin may be getting too old to play high schoolers. Colin Farrell submits a more scruffy, more feral bloodsucker than did Chris Sarandon, although he's just as charming. It's a different take, that's all, and not a bad one, at that. (By the way, Sarandon shows up in a cameo as a victim.) Farrell exudes this shady vibe. There's a very well done scene in which Jerry is standing right outside the open doorway of Charley's house, waiting for Charley to lend his a six-pack of beer. It's apparent that he's waiting for Charley to ask him in, but Charley at this stage has got the wind up, is starting to put the pieces together. You can feel that aura of menace just start to build and emanate from Jerry as he realizes that he's not going to get an invite after all. It's one of the best scenes in the film. Meanwhile, David Tennant makes the most of his showy role, playing the boozy and indifferent Las Vegas stage magician who's boned up on vampire methodology. He's fun to watch and his Peter Vincent is very different from his Doctor Who role. But he's no Roddy McDowall. For that matter, when it comes to playing Evil Ed, Christopher Mintz-Plasse doesn't have the impact of a Stephen Geoffreys.<br /><br />I do recommend FRIGHT NIGHT the remake. There are pretty good scares, although, as in the original version, it flirts with the tongue-in-cheek stuff. This plays right in the wheelhouse of screenplay writer Marti Noxen, who used to pen episodes of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Maybe the highest compliment I could pay this FRIGHT NIGHT is that it sort of recaptures that cool LOST BOYS vibe. Not that I'm saying this is as good as THE LOST BOYS. But if you see this playing on cable, stop and look. At least these vampires don't have sparkles.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Bloopers (00:03:25 minutes)<br />- Kid Cudi \\"No One Believes Me\\" Music Video (Uncensored Version)<br />- the Squid Man sequence - Extended & Uncut (00:02:56 minutes)odes of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.

B004I744AS|5.0|its great there's hangman a spelling bee and there's news and weather and word of the day and its just great
B0036EH3TS|5.0|I wish there were more inspiring movies like this.  I still brings tears to my eyes, and makes we wish we had more heroes like these guys.  If I wanted to hear about more bad people doing bad things, there are far too many options out there.  Please make more movies that make people feel good, where the good guys win, even if they have to pay a terrible cost.  Reluctant heroes are all the more inspiring.
B005DZMNHA|5.0|this is a great bluesy album loved it and a lot of my friends agree. the sale was easy  quick and painless which is the way i like it
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I was very excited to get this movie as a rental.  All the hype and excitement that I had read in reviews really got my interest.  Then...I started to watch it and could not believe just how BAD this movie really is.  Is there another version that makes is so good to be the Amazon #1 seller now?  I can't imagine why people would buy this movie--let alone watch it!  Another Gosling goose egg better fried and eaten with toast than watched.  Most of the actors behaved as if they were on some hallucinogenic drug or sleeping pill.  One line delivered and then 15 seconds go by before someone responds with one or two words.  Save your time and skip this one!  UPDATE: I found this review from a less-biased source that really explained the main issue I have with this film:  I can understand the approach Refn, screenwriter Hossein Amini, and Gosling himself wanted to take with the character, making him a man of few words, somewhat awkward around other people, and slow to show emotion. The problem is that he feels--and I mean no offense here and this isn't a dig--almost autistic throughout. In quieter moments, Gosling doesn't seem to know what to do with his face, alternately between a goofy smirk and slack indifference. Throughout most of the film, he doesn't really modulate his voice beyond a flat monotone and it's seldom his emotions even reach his eyes. I think the intent was to go for hardened and difficult to read, but what we get instead is emotionally arrested.
B001G8XON0|5.0|There are lots of things to love about this movie. The blend of modern music with a classic musical sounds is done so well. One might not think of having groups of men in suits and women in can-can girl dresses singing \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by Nirvana but (incredibly) it works. The songs chosen fit the story well; I laughed when they started singing \\"Roxanne\\" in the scene where they were discussing falling for a prostitute because it was perfect yet I didn't expect it. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have wonderful on-screen chemistry and both have terrific voices. All the acting in general is well done.  The writing is superb, from all the original material fleshing out the characters and the story, to the intermingling of excerpts from contemporary songs. There are some fantastic elements at times - a scene with Ewan and Nicole dancing from one building to another comes to mind - but these go with the whimsical feel of much of the film. Many of the sets and costumes are colorful and dazzling, the perfect compliment to the energetic dancing at the Moulin Rouge. Early on it's clear the story is destined to end tragically; however, the positive message about love and spirited portrayal prevent the film from being a downer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded this for my Kindle Fire and have been happily playing it since...highly recommend!  Really like the ease of card movement.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I'm finding I will exit out out the game b /c some of the games themselves are too difficult. its also annoying that you have to return to the home screen after every game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would highly recommend this series! I read The hunger Games (book 1) over the weekend and attempted to wait until the following weekend to read Catching Fire (book 2). I could not wait even a full day to find out what would happen to Katniss and Peeta!
030788743X|1.0|I wanted to like this book.  I really did.  I read the reviews and thought it sounded amazing.  And then I started reading it and it dawned on me that the dude in the book had a sad sad life.  He sits in front of a computer all day long and plays his little role play games trying to \\"win\\" a challenge set forth by the creator of a virtual world.<br /><br />People who love Second Life, Dungeons and Dragons, and World of Warcraft will love the book.  Those of us who think role playing/virtual games are for losers will have a hard time checking reality at the door and jumping in.<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble if you want to get your 80's fix: pop a John Hughes movie in your DVD, blast some Bon Jovi on your iPod, peg your jeans, or run out and see if you can get your hands on a pair of jelly shoes.  I'll take my 80's pop culture somewhere else, thank you very much.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|This album is very popish Coldplay. I don't like this album as much as the earlier albums. There sound has defenatly changed over the years and I am more a fan of the more mellow songs for example; \\"Yellow\\", \\"Trouble\\", \\"Shiver\\", \\"Green Eyes\\".
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|This is an excellent prison genre film that realistically depicts life behind bars. Behavior that involves manipulation, violence and unfair treatment towards inmates is just as relevant today as it was 30 or 40 years ago. Prisoners have an uncanny ability to realize a potential, they probably misused on the outside of prison walls, to become more creative. Overall the movie is a heartening depiction of human will overcoming insurmountable odds. Morgan Freeman's performance was superb and I would wholeheartedy recommend watching this movie.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This album is infused with passion, you can hardly listen to a song without being swept up by all the emotion. I listen to this album over and over and it only gets better. We need more ladies with voices like this singing their true feelings.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I bought the app and was told I needed to download another 80MB update! The download failed three times before completing.  The game plays in landscape and I had to suffer through some opening credits just to get to the game.<br /><br />Once I got to the game, it played as expected -- just like the UNO card game.  There are some settings to adjust game play -- difficulty levels, game modes (standard v/s duel), scoring type, and penalties.<br /><br />Overall, a fun game despite the minor issues.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This is a spectacular film; the acting is extremely subtle and emotionally driven, the music is spot on perfect (you'll be buying the soundtrack right afterward as I did) and the mood is so super-cool you'll want to live in those remarkable moments beat for beat within the film.  First, I concede that the marketing for this film may have attempted to sell the movie for something different than what it is, but that is hardly Nicholas Winding Refn's (Director) fault and the a fore mentioned fact should not cause you to fail to enjoy what can most closely be described as an art-house actioner from a brilliant auteur. Refn is always aware of the genre his film may be compared to and deliberately severs the connection between the two in his most poignant  scenes. Where one style would speed things up and force edit cuts on you every few seconds, Refn slows things down and lets you feel the pulse of each character, he lets you study them before the inevitable brutality commences. For example...  *Possible Spoilers Below  ...you'll notice the film features the bloodiest and most brutal scenes at the beginning and towards the middle, and then consciously removes the gore in favor of allowing the audience to soak in the character during the event, rather than the shock value of the event itself; this style emerges slowly and then reaches its peak in the finale. I believe this was deliberate and I feel it was very effective in giving this film its own tone, its own formula.  Don't expect what you've been programmed to expect; this is not a remake, sequel, rehash of old formulas, this is something new so study and try to enjoy it for what it is. I do not feel this film is made for everyone, but I do feel that a lot of viewers aren't judging it for what it is, merely how different it may be from what they were expecting. I try to enter a film with a blank slate as much as I can, don't listen to promotions, don't watch too many trailers, just go and experience the film for whatit is; Drive is definitely one of those times where you will benefit from pushing PLAY, open your eyes and ears and experience what the director intended...then discuss.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app. Easy to use perfect for life on the go since I have 4 little ones and I always running off to get them.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I. bought the kindle fire a few days ago and it is downloaded all my apps but it. come to this one it doesn't want to download. I know for a fact its compatiable because the one on display had this app.if anyone knows why this is happening please contact me at icykim@Aol.com thank you.
B00664AM5C|5.0|I thought I was going to hate this movie, but I loved it. It had great acting and a great story line that managed to capture how a real-life outbreak would really happen. Surprisingly, there was conflict and tension that will keep the viewer interested during the entire film. Unfortunately, everyone has friends that do not like to use their brain or can't focus on a movie because they have ADD or are not educated enough to comprehend the material. They will be frustrated by the movie. There was nothing to hate about this film. If someone cannot stand the movie, perhaps they should read a bit more and broaden their horizons. World disasters will not always involve transforming robots and massive explosions, so deal with it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Well this is a great distraction while I waited a the DMV made time fly by. I would personally. recommand this app to anyone that enjoys that offer you to think outside and inside the box at the same if you need clear direct on what to do to play a game this is not the app for you
B001RTSPVY|5.0|The best TV series ever!  I can't wait for season 5.  I'm the last person to own movies or tv shows on dvd, but I had to order this series and watch it all over again.  It is that damn good!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I figured out the ending a third of the way through...  So, while the action kept the reading bearable, I kept waiting to see how Collins handled some of the character development plot lines she created. She never did use them. What a disappointment.  First: In the beginning, Collins alludes to Katniss having to make the decision to become a hunter of people or not. Can Katniss kill someone in cold blood? Can she lie in wait for her human prey to cross her path, and then stare them down and kill them? Unfortunately, we never see her face that dilemma.  Second: Both Katniss and Peeta make a kill, yet we never see any of the effect that kill has on them. They killed a human. How can that not affect them? Even after the games end, there is no reflection of what they've done, only concern about what is yet to happen. And a bit of self-congratulations.  Third: I expected something more to develop from Katniss' wearing of the Mocking Jay pin. It was explained in some detail, yet it disappears while Katniss is in the arena. Then suddenly it appears again at the end.  The action in the book kept me going, but for this to be a great book, it really needs more character development. I will probably read the remainder of the books only because they are a quick read, and I still hold hope that Collins will use her next book to develop her characters more.
1573301183|5.0|I had not seen or heard this performance since it originally aired when I was a teenager.  I remembered loving it then and have always been an Alice in Chains fan but seeing it again was a real revival.  Its sad thought about Layne, there are things in the performance that at the time I'm sure were really funny but now underneath the humor is a real sadness when you know how things turned out.  On a more upbeat note thought the performance is spot on by everyone in the band and truly showcases Jerry Cantrell's song writing and playing abilities.  I would recommend the heck out of this DVD for anyone who grew up in the 90's.  If you grew up in the 90's and didn't like Alice In Chains... then you shouldn't be on this page anyway.
B0029XFNA8|4.0|The story is a classic and this original is one of the best.  However, as a Blu-ray we expected a bit more.  First, the cover shows the colorized version of the movie.  We expected to get both, you only get the black and white version.  In fact, that is all you get.  Hardly worth the blu-ray disk storage.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I have been checking everyday for a new Fire Maple release- Hurray!!!! clean, smart, engaging Fun!!!!! Keep up the EXCELLENT work!
B00006JLX4|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Pavement CD though it's impossible to go wrong with any of their music. A must have.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie is a beautiful adaptation of the book, very moving and shows a lot about the human spirit.  I would have to say it is a wonderful movie, simple yet compelling.
B001GNRNQE|5.0|This girl has me waving my hands in the air like I'm at church! She is amazing! YES!!! I've had this song on repeat! I love the message of this song. It's very positive, and talks about a couple sticking together. We need songs like this in this age where people break up as soon as somebody's ex says \\"hi\\" at the grocery store. Not enough couples \\"fight\\" anymore.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great concept. Totally different. I don't do well with this type of puzzles, but enjoying the challenges.  Purchased both this app and Quell Reflect. Thanks for developing these gems Fallen Tree Games.  Am both frustrated and challenged.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Never let the facts get in the way of a good story, and this is a very good, cinematic story. Enjoy the ride, and don't worry about how much of it is distorted, exaggerated or untrue. I was an American League baseball beat writer during those years and walked those clubhouses. But I'm still a sucker for a good baseball story and will happily suspend disbelief when it's entertainment, rather than documentary. The script is solid, as are the acting and directing, if not quite worthy of \\"Best Picture.\\" My favorite baseball movie of all time, \\"A League of Their Own,\\" also was \\"based\\" on a true story, and those liberties with fact do not bother me. The Special Features with the real Billy Beane are good. One small complaint: \\"Moneyball\\" looks a little grainy, which I assume was a decision of the director or cinematographer. That's fine for a period piece like \\"Stand By Me,\\" but for \\"Moneyball,\\" I would have preferred a sharper picture.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I ordered this because it was recommended by other users, and I'm very  happy with the product. It's roomy enough to store my camera and extra lenses. It also lays flat for easy access.  I\\"m also very happy with Amazon customer service. The first backpack I ordered never arrived, so after my inquiry, they immediately sent another one, which I promptly received.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|This is a great movie!! Glad they had an X-Men movie that explained the beginning.  This Blu-ray in particular was clear picture and sound. :)  I was very happy with my purchase
B005T87QCI|4.0|I would like to know how fun before purchase. thanks a lot people of the world how funk is the game ya ya ya ya ya
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I originally thought it would be a game the I could use to kill time, but it actually turned out to be more challenging than expected. Don't get me wrong... it is still incredibly stupid, but in a good way because ot actually requieres some strategy and fast thinking to get through some of the games.
0380820846|5.0|This is by far my favourite out of the Bridgerton saga. Colin, worldly, urbane and totally funny; Penelope, funny, secretive and a wallflower. She has been in love with Colin practically her whole life, had her heart broken by Colin once but that didn't dim her love for him. Colin always thought of Penelope as his sisters friend nothing more until that fateful day when she read his diary.  I love these two characters, other than Daphne and Simon they are by far my favourites. I remember reading this book and not being able to put it down longer than a minute. I read the whole book in one day. That's how much I loved it.  Every one loves it when the plain, unpopular girl snares the great looking popluar guy; and the popular snide little brat gets put in her place yet again.  Well done Julia Quinn on another fine story that made me laugh and cry.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Great show, great characters, great actors and the best set decoration I've seen in the business.  Couldn't be better; now if I only knew when the next season would begin!  Jennifer Paley
B001NEK2GE|3.0|Many have written lengthy and good reviews, so I'll be brief.  I realy like my G13.  Have had it a few weeks now.  I'd say it took me about 2 to 3 hours of play time to get used to it and maybe another hour or so to tweek mappings to where I like them.  I was hoping to use the joy stick for motion, but as others have said on here, that doesn't really work.  But, I map actions with longer cooldowns, but ones I want to use a lot.  So I can kind of flick my thumb and take care of it.  I did keep backwards on it, because I use the mouse to move otherwise, and I can't go backwards with it.  But I don't need it much.  I put a pad under my wrist, because I like to come down on the keys more than the actual shape lets me.  But that 2.5 in or so elevation makes it perfect for me.  The custom colors are pretty cool too.  I would not pay $80 for this, but I got it when it was down to like $58 and I had a couple promos that got it down to $35.  Well worth it at that price.  Update: I've had this over a year now and would not go without it.  I still hold to my original comment that I still put a pad under my wrist to raise my hand on it more, but short of that, I really like using it and would purchase it again.  Update. I keep having issues with the buttons by the joy stick. One went bad and I replaced it. I have had this about 1 year and it too has got bad. Not sure how I can go without it but I don't really want to buy another one.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I was finding the proper shield for my daughter's Kindle fire.  Relatively, it is not expensive.  It really light, and I feel it is so durable and fits very well to the Kindle.  I am satisfied with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has a great plot, good characters who develop throughout the story, and a satisfying conclusion that still leaves you wanting to know more.  The plot reminded me of Orwell or Bradbury, believable and terrifying.  It is something that I certainly hope never comes close to the truth in the future, but you still believe it could, and wind up asking yourself, what if it did.  The story is touching, funny, thrilling and completely engaging.  It is coming out as a movie soon.  I hope Hollywood can do it justice!  Do yourself a favor and click \\"buy,\\" but be ready for an \\"I just couldn't put it down\\" experience.

0802473156|4.0|This book is easy to read and implement.  If you take it seriously and learn to appreciate the differences between you and your mate, rather than bemoan that you are not understood, you could take your relationship to a high level of mutual satisfaction.  This book should be required reading for all people who are about to embark on a serious long-term relationship.  If more husbands and wives practiced the simple advice given in this book, we would see more loving and lasting relationships in this country!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved book 1 and liked book 2, but this one was a huge disappointment.  I wanted to see Katniss grow up and really take responsibility for her actions, to fight and end the games because she claimed her power and asserted herself heroically.  Sadly, Katniss continues to be fearful, insecure, unsure of any decision and unable to commit to a course of action.  She is manipulated by others and by the system.  She spends a lot of time crying or recovering from wounds or wondering what she could ever do to make a difference.  I wanted to scream at her wake up and appreciate the incredible power and opportunity she had for the taking.  I wanted to make her see the preciousness of her relationships, which just wilt in this book.  I really only finished reading it because I wanted to finish the series.  It felt contrived and untrue to the plot and characters' journeys which began in book 1.  Mockingjay should have soared above the others, bringing a wonderful story to its powerful and compelling conclusion, but it fell dead, flopping at my feet.

B005KELQEU|5.0|I got this when all the Amazon kindle covers with lights built in were leather. I figured if I'm going to get something to protect my new touch, then I'll just get something light-weight if I can't have built-in lights (I don't buy leather products). And this was a great choice! It's pretty versatile. I can keep it in my purse and slip it in without removing the sleeve if I zip it one way for the horizontally shaped purse and zip it another way for the more vertically shaped purse.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I actually just discovered this show about a month ago, 10 years after it aired.  The thousands of 5-star reviews caught my attention so I figured it was worth a try.  LOVED. IT.  I watched the entire 14 episodes, plus the movie Serenity which ties up the series, in a span of 5 days.  I'm now in withdrawals.  With so much garbage on televison right now, I wish they made more like this.  Lots of action, drama, romance, and laugh-out-loud moments.  Wonderful characters and great story-line.  I've recommended it to everyone I know.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|All in all \\"El Camino\\" is a solid CD, but I have to say I'm a little disappointed.  Relative to other CDs by The Black Keys, I would rate this more of a 2.  However, relative to most new music on the market, I would rate this more of a 4.  Bottom line, The Black Keys are one of the best bands out there today.  \\"El Camino\\" falls short of The Black Keys earlier work (pre \\"Attack and Release\\") and is a weak follow up to the \\"Brothers\\" CD, which I believe is one of the best CDs to be released in the past decade.  Dan Auerbach is a great song writer, but this CD feels uninspired.  Most, if not all, songs on \\"El Camino\\" sound as if they came off the same assembly lines as those mini vans pictured in the CD artwork -- produced quick and cheap for mass consumption.  These tunes are well crafted and a good ride short term, but they won't stand the test of time.  The Black Keys next CD will be telling of the band's direction and, ultimately, their integrity.  There is no shame in becoming popular, I just hope they haven't sold their soul in doing so.  ADDENDUM:  Since I originally wrote the review above, I have been listening to \\"El Camino\\" in the car (preparing to see them in concert in March), and the CD has grown on me.  I have upgraded my score from 3 to 4.  Again this is a very solid CD, and The Black Keys really are better than 90% of the music being put out.  One additional point I would like to make -- Patrick Carney's drumming plays an important role in defining The Black Keys sound.  The strongest tracks on \\"El Camino\\" are those in which Carney leaves his signature.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is a revolutionary read. I have resisted books relating to spirituality and religion forged from my own experiences of the church and the corruption that is associated. I used to go to a pentecostal church where the magic at front of stage was purely a front to extract money and followers to complete the agenda of the few. This book has opened my eyes to true reality and empowered me to walk the path of enlightenment, including giving me the tools to help others identify and free themselves from the mental bondage and anguish of living in a corrupt and greed driven society.<br /><br />If you have an internal murmuring that questions life, questioning why you cannot disconnect yourself mentally from work or family, or can't quite grasp why you keep making the same relationship mistakes over and over, or why you feel rage, frustration or fear when a situation does not go the way you predicted - then I highly recommend this book. If you are incredibly mentally or emotionally burdened I would recommend reading it twice, as the tools you gain throughout the book will help you focus on the content if you read a second time.<br /><br />If you are deeply cynical of religion and spirituality, please reduce the urge to close the book at the mere mention of God, Jesus, Buddha or any scripture - Eckhart requires these as labels or signposts to guide the reader throughout the book, as he will describe the more you read.<br /><br />I have already bought copies for my staff that are having personal and disconnecting from work related issues, forewarning them of the spiritual and religious connotations in the book, as I am sure everyone has had some form crisis with a religious organisation, and most humans don't like religion being forced or subliminally marketed to them.<br /><br />I write this review based on past experiences to connect with anyone that might be hesitant in pursuing this book.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|I grew up with the Muppets, and grew to dislike almost all of their movies.  I went into this hoping that I'd not be disappointed, and brought my family (including kids ages 2, 9 and 12).  I loved it, the kids loved it (the two year old sings the soundtrack, for goodness sake).  Anyone reviewing this movie claiming that the plot is cheesy and the story-telling is lazy is both right and ridiculously overthinking it.  The film is faithful to the tv show, the music is mostly memorable, and the actors are all very clearly having a great time.  What more can you ask (other than a bit more of Animal, perhaps)?

0393338959|2.0|Joseph Stiglitz is an interesting character.  He is seen as an outsider of the political establishment although he is very much a part of it; and is a darling of the leftists in this country while simultaneously promoting numerous ideas that either directly, or through their implementation, are opposed to the leftist's stated goals.  This follows in the traditional modern leftists tradition of settling with a \\"this is the best we can expect\\" mentality and the traditional intellectual laziness that permeates the entire body politic; where people are simply passive consumers of political ideas rather than doing the required research, discussion and classical logic (think Platonic dialectic) to come to rational conclusions regarding humanities problems.  After all, all these things require work and humility.  Stiglitz, while further developed than most mainstream economic cultists, still believes and promotes many false and wildly insane things in a book that would otherwise be overall fairly good - compared to many other modern books on economics.  1) Stiglitz operates from the mindset that Globalization is a net good to humanity, as he never challenges or seeks to reform the problems that were (and continue to be) caused by Globalization, especially in regards to the immediate crisis.  He specifically warns about \\"protectionism\\", as if tariffs are \\"beggar-thy-neighbor policies\\" and yet somehow Quantitative Easing isn't a \\"beggar-thy-neighbor policy\\".  Tariffs DO NOT qualify as \\"beggar-thy-neighbor\\" but even if they did, they support the forces of labor and production over finance capital; Quantitative Easing or \\"Competitive Devaluation\\" is simply a global means of \\"beggar-thy-labor\\" as its primary - and stated - goal is to drive down the price of labor.  And as other nations must follow suite with devaluation or be priced out of the market, it universally shifts the much weight of the economic crisis to the global forces of labor.  We see this in the decreasing wages, lower starting wages for new jobs, lower statistical average for jobs for recent graduates, and of course the price of commodities increasing (or inflating) in relation to decreasing or stagnant wages (deflation).  2) This 2nd is one of the most egregious fallacies - nay, not a fallacy but something plainly sinister.  Stiglitz claims that net exporters (countries with trade surpluses) cause problems in relation to the net importers (countries with trade deficits) of the world and that the solution is for those exporting nations to have their exports limited or capped.  I've heard this idea popping up all over the internet, repeated by people who are very much politically inclined to be fans of Stiglitz.  This idea proclaims that it is better for a country like Germany to have its massive trade surplus artificially limited and arbitrarily reduced so other nations cannot maintain a trade deficit.  If one enacts this logic in the first level we see that hundreds of billions of dollars of value that would have been created for export simply would not exist and the world would be incredibly poorer as a result.  Next, since any problem of a `trade surplus' can (by this theory) be resolved by reducing that supply, rather than increasing the productive capacity and value creation of the country, we see that this is a global race to that bottom, where all `problems of overproduction' can be solved by reducing production and supply.  Rather than increasing the net value creation of humanity, all problems of trade imbalance can be solved by reducing the net value creation.  This is a bottomless pit.  One wonders, since Stiglitz uses this infernal \\"logic\\" for international trade, does he apply it to domestic production as well?  One can imagine Stiglitz gleefully bulldozing houses as they did under the Hoover administration to increase prices through willful destruction of supply rather than enabling the population to create their own demand by employing useful productivity.It is a testament to the modern evil, ignorance and stupidity of our society to promote \\"ideas\\" as toxic as this one.  The obvious solution to a trade imbalance is to PRODUCE YOUR WAY OUT OF IT - use tools of the American System of Political Economy as necessary.  3) As Stiglitz hails himself as a \\"Keynesian\\", he follows in the Keynesian tradition of avoiding the obvious solution to our crisis: Nationalizing our Central Bank (Federal Reserve) so the nation can function as its own bank.  Keynesianism suggests, somehow, that it is better to borrow money to spend for public works than to simply issue it yourself as is your sovereign right as a modern nation state.  The United States needs to regain its sovereignty and dump its oligarchical owners and controllers - but don't look to Stiglitz to help us do that, he's too busy rubbing elbows with them at Davos and other elite get-togethers.  4) As I'm someone who has interviewed hedge fund technicians & programmers at what ACTUALLY goes on in modern finance - it is not surprising to see that nowhere does Stiglitz discuss the massive socio-economic problems plaguing the financial markets and how they relate to our overall crisis.  If he did he would have to have proposed solutions to it to save face.  He doesn't discuss what these various financial markets should exist for (historically and in terms of social necessity) and therefore can't separate the wheat (legitimate investment) from the chaff (\\"scalping\\", high frequency trading, \\"churning\\", \\"pump and dump schemes\\" and all other manner of larceny, parasitism, and fraud that occurs on a daily basis in these markets).  Therefore, the solution to much of this parasitism, that is, the a Financial Transaction Tax, Tobin Tax (if collected by the individual nation states), or Wall St. Sales Tax is never discussed.  5) Of course the massive benefits of fixed international currency exchanges (Bretton Woods) with regards to the real economy aren't discussed as a solution to ourproblems.  Fixed exchanges are completely ignored in how they operate to promote and actual industrial, productive, value-generating society over the interests of financial speculators and parasites.  This is anti-surprising given Stiglitz's econo-religious orthodoxy he is still very much a part of.  6) He says that more economic depression, austerity and misery and \\"unavoidable\\".  This is simply not true; a recovery is simply an issue of political will - nothing more.  The means out of this crisis have been put forth by myself and others, if anyone wants to know the way out of this mess please look up Dr. Webster Tarpley's economic recovery program.  It is about 80% similar to my own.  There are numerous other problems I have with Stiglitz's analysis, but they practically all stem from these non-factually-based ideological viewpoints as I've illustrated above.  As all the avoidance of the things I mentioned: Globalization, sovereignty of national ownership over its Central Bank, modern financial market operations, Bretton Woods or other fixed exchange models, and the inevitability of the depression; aren't simply trifling or textural problems - but core to the very nature of the crisis we are experiencing - this book gets two stars and barely that.  Other than these ideological flaws the book is fairly good, you just have to know and understand the ideology of the person that you are reading.  For those of you that don't read dozens of economic books per year I'd recommend something that can give you a better foundation on reality.  Something from Steve Keen, Michael Hudson, Herman Finer, Friedrich List, Heikki Patomaki, Ha-Joon Chang, John Quiggin, Les Leopold, Webster G. Tarpley and of course Alexander Hamilton's Report on Manufacturers to name a few.
B006ZBRMOU|1.0|More of the same from the prior two installments of this story only worse. More exhausting melodramatic hot mess. Normally I would do a review but I have wasted too much time as it is reading this story in it's entirety. It amazes me that readers say they would want a real man with the qualities of Christian Grey (aka originally Jame's twisted version of Edward Cullen). His personality is the type that would seriously cause a sane person to consider murder or suicide. I opt for neither Christian nor Edward and will stick with Roarke.<br /><br />*The fact that the author has separated a single story into three separate ebooks for profit is insulting and considering it's poorly edited fanfiction, it is not worth the total price of $30.
B005FLX1HS|4.0|Skrillex blew me away with Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites; this time, he gives us a follow-up that feels more direct and less layered.  The hooks aren't as mindblowing as Scary Monsters, but there's enough on here to satisfy.  While there was less vocal layering than I would like, this album deserved every penny I paid for it.  Let's take it a track at a time.  01. Right In: Definitely feeling the drop at around 0:59 (sounds like S-S-SONNNYY).  Whenever Skrillex layers vocals and instruments into a melody, it's creates a very powerful effect.  While the other distorted, \\"transformers-sounding\\" drops are more forgettable, this beginning track sets off the album right, with an absolute club shaker coming in afterward - reminding me of why I love Skrillex.  02. Bangarang: The drop hits HARD.  Sirah was NOT needed, however; I am not feeling this sudden mix of house music with rap (David Guetta, recent tracks by Deadmau5 with Sofi); this may be an opinion of only mine, because it keeps happening, but I digress.  This is definitely one of my favorite drops by Skrillex, though, hands down.  03. Breakn' a Sweat: The centerpiece of the album comes in at full force, with one of the most ADDICTING hooks I've ever heard in a song.  This collaboration with the Doors showcases Ray Manzarek's awesome keyboarding abilities that I'm sure we're all well aware of; Skrillex takes hold of the buildup and never lets it down, repeating a chorus that is more than well-deserved to be repeated, although one bridge too many.  A nice quote from Jim Morrison from back in the day accurately predicts how the song it is featured in has been made; very interesting.  04. The Devil's Den (feat. Wolfgang Gartner): This is definitely a different style for Skrillex, for all of those people saying that he is mostly rehashing his old presets on his Massive VST.  Wolfgang Gartner gives this track not only a different BPM, but a different feel overall - becoming the closest thing we can get to at the moment of what a collab with the Mau5 would sound like.  05. Right on Time: This is two different songs, with the 2nd starting at 1:39, and then going back to the first at 2:50.  Personally, my least favorite song.  A discord synth that reminds me of the most generic house music you can think of, with an extremely repetitive \\"RIGHT-ON-TIME\\" sample playing throughout the whole time.  I had to skip this one, although I listened to the whole album straight through.  I know that Skrillex is trying to venture into other genres, and he definitely has.  But this is just a mistake.  06. Kyoto: The hook is pure quality.  One of his best; so good, to the point where Sirah actually fitted in here.  The guitar hook, the rolling hip-hop snares, everything about this track shows Skrillex getting into a more hip-hop/rock/crunk feel, but still sticking to what he's known for best: distorted dubstep & electro.  But honestly, I'm only using genres for comparison; I still am at a loss for words in terms of a genre to put Sonny Moore in.  And it shows - with his wide variety of musical styles, apparent with the transition from this to the next track.  07. Summit: The \\"With You, Friends\\" of Bangarang.  Very light, but in contrast to \\"With You\\", keeps it's tempo and beat all throughout (besides a few well-fitted breakdowns).  The \\"chill\\" track of the album, it sends us off with a feeling of uncertainty, as if there might be a second part to an album that was already a sequel.  In short, this album is worth buying.  Is it a complete work?  In a sense, yes.  Does it feel that way?  Unfortunately, no - but if you like catchy electronic music that you can dance to, and has a recognizable well-crafted hook, then you will easily enjoy Skrillex's newest work.  You can always be a critic, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this - ignore the fact that Skrillex has put something out similar to this, and instead let your instinct allow you to decide.

I really enjoy the Garmin Connect site where your information downloads to and where you can review.

Don't think though that you are going to pull this out of the box and immediately use it. There are tons of features and it will take a little homework.

0893860220|5.0|I could have finished this book days ago if all I wanted to do was to read it. Instead, it has compelled me to slowly chew on every chapter. I read a chapter once and in silence let it settle in as I reflect on it. Sometimes I read it two or three more times. I will, in some, copy out the entire chapter in a notebook. The act of writing it out slowly gives me way of physically connecting with it which further sinks into my being. I'm only nearing half way into the book as of today.<br /><br />I read one of the reviewers expressing their annoyance on the stupidity of some of the questions being asked of Maharaj. As for me, I think the beauty of a 'stupid' question(s), if there is such a thing, gives me a sense of perspective--kind of the way a photographer will put a penny next to an object in order for the viewer to get a relative idea of the actual size of the object. In this case, the photographer is Maharaj and the penny is the 'stupid' question. Additionally, I can appreciate and relate to so-called stupid questions since some of them I recognize I would've asked myself a few years, months or even weeks ago! Actually, come to think of it, every question thus far seems to bring out facets of brilliance in the gem that Maharaj illucidates. Every tiny sparkle and glint catches the eye of the soul.<br /><br />It is moving and wonderful to read that Maharaj was but a lowly cigarette vendor and he speaks of it matter-of-factly in here. He also points out how his home is across from the public toilet. These two statements come about due to a questioner asking about non-violence and how come he sits on the skin of a dead animal. He lived a life as ordinary as one can get. No bells and whistles of an ashram to speak of and yet the magnificent simplicity and truth of his life and teachings makes it all that much more powerful, relatable and loving.

B003OFVIXG|4.0|The cover photo shows a rather edgy young woman with her name graffitied on the wall next to her.  I expected the music to be somewhat raw.  However, for the most part this is a nice cabaret performance.  I am trying to work on my French, and Zaz actually sings slowly and clearly enough that I can sort of understand what she is singing about. She has a great voice, definitely reminiscent of Edith Piaf.  It's mostly pretty easygoing stuff.  However, she really belts the last track with a ton of passion.  I'm definitely going to work on the translation for that one.  Often CDs by foreign artists do not seem very accessible.  This one travels very well across the pond.

0307277887|3.0|I'm aware of the Showtime Dexter series but have never gotten round to watching it.  Then a friend recommended the series after watching the multiple seasons in a marathon viewing session.  I opted to read the first novel in the series.  Go straight to the source, I say.  Well, I enjoyed the dark humor.  I especially appreciated Lindsay's ability to help us understand the cold unemotional world in which a sociopathic psychotic killer lives.  For me, this is the best aspect of the novel.  I found myself imagining what that must be like, to feel nothing, to relate to no one, to be always putting a show on to deceive people into thinking you are like them and you like them.  However, I found other aspects of the book not as compelling, in particular the reveal at the end, which I will not reveal, even though almost everybody reading this probably knows what it is.  Good, but for the best serial killer fiction, see me list of favorites at http://www.amazon.com/lm/R70AQ0BU2OCRL/ref=cm_pdp_lm_title_1.

0307949486|1.0|Those of you who know me in real life know just how much I despise this book, and now you, my virtual friends can know too.  The first hundred pages detailing a libel case about a Swedish mogul's financial crimes are mind-numbingly boring.  But, I plowed through it because millions of people have read this book, and millions of people can't be wrong.  Right?<br /><br /> After getting out of jail for the aforementioned libel case, the main character, Mikael Blomkvist is hired by Henrik Vagner, a tycoon, to solve the cold case of the murder of his niece Harriet.  Blomkvist hires Lisbeth Salander (the owner of the dragon tattoo) to help him solve the case, which they do by hacking a lot of computers and drinking a lot of coffee.<br /><br /> The dialogue is stilted, the pacing is the literary version of stop and go traffic and most of the characters are one-dimensional.  One redeeming quality is that Lisbeth Salander, with her troubled past, social incapacities and the intensity of her fixations, is an interesting character.  However, she is not enough to save this book.<br /><br /> The skeleton of the story is a basic who-dunnit, so how does Larsen add some much needed action to this run of the mill plot?  With lots of rape scenes, of course!  Lisbeth gets raped by her legal guardian, so she rapes him right back.  It turns out the men of the Vagner family make raping and killing a family affair, with the father teaching the son the tools of the trade.  Along the way there is also some good, old-fashioned consensual sex between Blomkvist and every woman he spends more than five minutes with.<br /><br /> Rapes happen.  They occur among strangers and within families.  We should work to prevent crimes against women and girls, not use these moments of devastation as titillating padding for a flimsy plot.<br /><br /> I wish I could get a refund for the hours I spent suffering through this story, expecting something, anything that would explain its phenomenal success.<br />The only explanation I can find is that the success of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an example of group-think gone horribly wrong.he Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an example of group-think gone horribly wrong.

0307477479|5.0|In the novel A Visit from the Goon Squad, Jennifer Egan doesn't give you a straight story line, rather, she hands you a bag of puzzle pieces and it is up to you to assemble the story.  At the center of the novel's spider web is Sasha, a complicated woman who compulsively collects mementos from the people she encounters;  the only problem being those mementos happen to be people's wallets, scarves, keys and other items they would most surely want to hold on to.  Benny, Sasha's over-the-hill, out of touch music producer boss, is a character in the following chapter.  While the next is built around a character from Benny's story, and so on and so forth.  As the story progresses certain characters fade into the background while others come to the forefront, and each chapter is told from a different point of view at a different point in time.  All of this pogoing around through time and space could easily descend into a clever gimmick. What makes this book work is that the characters are so damn compelling.  Two paragraphs into a chapter and you are desperate to know why Sasha is so circumspect.  Who was Benny before became so obsessed with regaining his virility that he developed a habit of eating gold?  And Lou, not a vampire of fantasy, but a real life vampire who steals the life out of young girls to keep himself feeling young, will he get what he deserves?  Failure and success, youth and aging, those who buckle under the accumulation of years and those who flourish; these are themes that run through all the stories.  By the final chapter of the book, which is told through power point slides, you can step back and see how these seemingly fragmented pieces all connect, one person's life rubbing up against another's, discrete points of contact, a web of humanity, both virtual and physical, so much like our world today.
0880796863|4.0|This is defenitly not the Tarot pack you are looking for if you are just starting out. For a beginner I would recommend [[ASIN:0738711500 Easy Tarot: Learn to Read the Cards Once and For All!]]  I only gave this four stars instead of five because the booklet for the cards is so small. The artwork and graphics however are much better than the picture, and the colors are much more vivid. The explanations of the cards go very in depth and this product is better than I expected it to be for the price. It comes in a neat little box to keep all the cards and help guide with it. For this price if you are an advanced Tarot reader I would defenitly recommend this product. Fast and efficient, thank you Amazon.
0061547840|4.0|I can't say great but I can say read it.  This is a fundamental American message: Take advantage of your freedoms, and be as successful as you want to be. He emphasizes taking responsibility for yourself, and not blaming him or her or society or the government or whoever. Be passionate about what you do, and strive to be the best at it. The basic message is a good one that should be taught in schools about personal responsibility and ability.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Though directed by Joe Carnahan and written by Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, the driving force behind the story and themes in The Grey is a man who died almost a hundred years ago:  the great American writer, Jack London.  His name appears nowhere in the credits and the film is not adapted from  any of his stories, yet it's a sure bet that both Carnahan and Mackenzie are intimately familiar with him because his literary fingerprints are all over this film.  If you've read London, then you know exactly what you're in for.  If you haven't read London, then you probably don't.<br /><br />The basic plot in The Grey is remarkably simple:  a plane transporting a group of workers from a remote Alaskan oil drilling station during a blizzard crashes in the wilderness, leaving only a handful of survivors.  The survivors quickly discover that they not only have to contend with being stranded in the freezing wilderness with little in the way of food or shelter and even less in hope of rescue, they are also being beset by a pack of highly aggressive and territorial wolves who view them as intruders to be eliminated.  It's man against nature and the elements.  It's Jack London's world, with all that that implies, updated into the 21st century.<br /><br />The center of the story is in its main point-of-view character, John Ottway (Liam Neeson), a man who specializes in protecting oil field workers in the field from wilderness predators, most particularly wolves, watching for them and picking them off with his rifle if they make any moves to attack the workers.  Ottway is a man beset by memories and an overwhelming sense of loss centered around a woman we see only in snippets of flashback.  But for all of his depression and loss, there is still something primal in Ottway, something that can still pull him out of himself.  In an early scene, when Ottway is on the verge of giving in to his despair, he unexpectedly hears a wolf howl at the critical moment.  The searching look on Neeson's face when he looks up at the howl says more than any spoken words possible could.<br /><br />Neeson brings, as always, a centering gravitas to the role and in terms of the action he's the one who makes things happen as Ottway quickly - and quietly - takes control of the situation after the plane has crashed.  But it's a mark of the work Carnahan and Jeffers did with the script and the directing that The Grey is much more than just Neeson and is a far cut above the usual cliched work that Hollywood films of this theme usually fall into.  The Grey engages you in ways far beyond the who's-gonna-die-next-and-how-are-they-doing-to-die? formula most films of this genre never rise above. Armed with a well-done script and dialogue, the supporting cast do an excellent job, both of fleshing out their characters as individuals and of convincing you of the kind of bonding that can come - however awkwardly and uneasily - when groups of strangers suddenly find themselves confronted by the ultimate in desperate situations.  One of the things I really liked were the scenes where nervous laughter would sometimes break out in the group as they seize upon the damnedest things to laugh about, drawing them towards each other and away from their fears.  Frank Grillo in particular as the hard-case ex-con Diaz gives an outstanding performance, taking what could easily have been a throwaway clich&eacute; of a character and making him sympathetic in surprising and subtle turns.  When these characters die, it _matters_ to you.  Which makes the film matter and keeps you thoroughly engaged all the way to the end.<br /><br />The script also makes a lot of subtle and clever contrasts, one of them being showing men as a pack dealing with wolves as a pack.  A good example is a scene in which the characters suddenly hear some fierce growling followed by a painful yelp coming from the woods around them.  When one of the men asks \\"What was _that_?\\", Ottway explains that it was the alpha wolfof the pack putting down a challenge from one of the other wolves.  A few minutes later, Ottway ends up doing exactly the same thing when one of the other men in the group challenges his authority.  No narration or exposition is needed - the film smoothly and efficiently gives exactly enough to make its point and no more.<br /><br />I will mention in advance that not everyone will like the way The Grey ends.  It caught me somewhat by surprise, but in looking back on it, I feel that it could not have ended any other way.  To give it the kind of clean, neat Hollywood ending that people tend to expect would have violated the spirit of the film and everything that it had subtly built up to.  The poem that Ottway recites earlier in the film, one he remembers that his father had written, comes back again in the final scene:<br /><br />\\"Once more into the fray,<br />Into the last fight I'll ever know.<br />Live and die on this day.<br />Live and die on this day.\\"<br /><br />When you reflect on that, and on everything that goes on throughout the film, you realize that the film ends the way it had to in order to stay true to itself, and it's to Carnahan's credit that he didn't take the easy way out.<br /><br />And speaking of credits, there is apparently a very brief post-credits scene (which I did not know about) that you may wish to wait for.  Whether or not it clarifies or muddles things appears to be a matter of interpretation and argument as different people come away with different reactions and interpretations of it, and with differing opinions as to whether it added to or detracted from the main ending.  Not having seen it myself, I find that I don't feel I need to as I felt the main ending was exactly the way it should be. But I did feel I should mention its existence so that you can choose to catch it if you want to.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give this film a full five stars rating is because of the way the wolves are depicted.  I know that it's largely a literary license taken by the writers to give the film its core conflict, but it does perpetuate the traditional stereotype of wolves as predatory threats towards humans when in reality they are quite wary and shy of humans and would not behave in the way the wolves in the film do.<br /><br />But that aside, I recommend The Grey as a well-written and directed London-esque film dealing with men in a life or death struggle against nature and the elements.of the other wolves.

B001LF347E|5.0|I love Merlin so much!  I literally can't stop watching it, which is partially due to the episodes themselves, and partially due to the amazing bonus features on this dvd set.  Audio commentaries with cast & crew, behind-the-scenes, making of, deleted scenes, video diaries; so much awesome in one little package!  The best feature on the dvd though, has got to be the cast's video diaries.  It's so fun just to see them living their normal every day lives, and to see how well the cast and crew really do get along!  Not disappointed in my purchase AT ALL!!

0385523912|5.0|This is a well written book about six people living in Chongjin, North Korea and their eventual escape. The book chronicles their lives during the 90's famine and describes their transition from \\"true believers\\" to defectors.  Not only is this a reminder that these tyrannies exist, but it also gives the reader a glimpse into the human spirit and serves as a reminder to put your own life into perspective and appreciate what you have and what can be taken away.

0375836675|3.0|The publisher's notes are extremely misleading.  While it says for \\"Ages 12 and up\\" or \\"Grades 9 and up,\\" this book is really not geared for anyone under the age of 18.  Or perhaps a very, very mature 16.  I am surprised it is classified as a children's book, and more surprised that I did not come across any reviews addressing the propriety of the content for young readers before I purchased the book.  My daughter is an advanced reader at age 11, and is just now entering the world of young adult fiction (Hunger Games, etc.)  I wanted to get her something of quality from the YA selections, and this appeared to be it.  What I was not expecting was the explicit sexual references throughout the novel.  An entire chapter is devoted to the narrator's perceived sexual inadequacies, titled, \\"Sex Should Be Like Math.\\"  One running theme throughout the novel is also the narrator/protagonist's desire to sleep with his best friend, while she apparently would eagerly have sex with anyone but him.  While the novel itself is well written, I cannot emphasize enough how inappropriate it is to classify this as a children's novel, or even YA novel.  It is an adult novel and parents need to be aware of the nature of the content.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I went for this cover in Red and I just love it!  I read a lot of reviews on different covers and tried to choose wisely and it paid off. I wanted not only a stylish cover, but one that would do its job and hold the KFire in place. It seems tight now and I am hoping it holds up. It does have a slight odor to it, but not as bad as some of the other people mentioned when they received theirs.  It is like holding an antique book in your hands, but inside it has all the new technology. You will be happy and satisfied if you purchase this Kindle Fire cover.

B00637HXNG|5.0|I just purchased this yesterday from a big box chain.  I do not have a 3D Blu-ray player, but I have a new Sony Blu-ray, and it plays perfectly.  While watching it though, you can tell which parts are in 3D, like when Klaus dangles the microphone stand into the crowd.  It's not distracting or anything, but you can tell what would be in 3D, or not.  I had the pleasure of seeing them on this last tour, and they were perfect.  Klaus' vocals are still great, and the band is tight. A nice mix of old, and new tracks here, but was surprised \\"No One Like You\\" was not on set list.  I love the new album, and this concert rocks!  Sound is excellent, and so is picture.  Hopefully one day I'll be able to enjoy in 3D!

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is a satisfying conclusion to Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy.  He wraps up many, but not all, of the loose ends with another fast-paced plot.<br /><br />In the trilogy, Mikael Blomkvist is portrayed as a champion of the oppressed who fights the rich and powerful in his quests for justice.  The fact that he has an ongoing affair with a married woman is not a character flaw, but a healthy diversion because he has the approval of Erika Berger's husband and it seems to help all of them stay energized.  The implication is that there is nothing wrong with such a relationship even though it is acknowledged that it is the cause of Blomkvist's divorce.  It also seems to be implied that this is not only a legitimate lifestyle, but a moral lifestyle because of all the good that Blomkvist accomplishes.<br /><br />But what of Blomkvist's daughter, Pernilla?  He has two encounters with her in the first novel, and no encounters in the second two novels that encompass approximately two years.  It could be argued that the author omits those details because they do not contribute to the plot.  But Mr. Larsson does give us details about what time Blomkvist gets up in the morning; what he has to eat, drink, and smoke; and what new clothes he buys when he does not have time to do his wash.  If these details are significant enough to include in the novel, wouldn't it be appropriate to mention a telephone call or an outing with his daughter?  How moral is a man who makes time for multiple bed partners but does not make time for his daughter?<br /><br />I know that having the protagonist spend a weekend with a sexy, body-building law enforcement officer might sell more books than having him spend his weekends with his teenage daughter.  But Mr. Larsson allegedly attempts to enlighten his readers about crimes against women.  Apparently he doesn't think that absentee fathers are a problem.
0756404738|2.0|I finished the Name of the Wind a while ago, and thought, ok, that book didn't really go anywhere narratively, but now the sequel is out, awesome!<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Wise Man's Fear doesn't really go anywhere either! It's just a collection of weird and barely-related stories about Kvothe, where he becomes increasingly more super-awesome-solves-every-problem-instantly.<br /><br />The Felurian part is also hilariously terrible. Might be worth picking up this book just to learn \\"how not to write fantasy fairy goddess romance.\\"<br /><br />Things that you'd think might have been addressed (or, gasp, resolved!) at this point, but in which no advancement is made:<br /><br />1. Those spider things from book 1. They kill a guy in book one, and seem important, but don't show up again.<br />2. Why Kvothe is even hiding in the first place. Yeah, we got \\"there is a bounty on his head,\\" but that's it.<br />3. What's up with Auri, the girl who lives under the University. \\"She's crazy.\\" That's it, huh?<br />4. What's up with the SUPER SECRET metal door in the Archives in the University. I guess it gets to stay a secret! Forever!<br />5. Devi really wanted to sneak into the Archives. Kvothe knew a SECRET FORBIDDEN way in. Kvothe owes Devi a ton of money. Oh, but now he has money, so I guess that didn't go anywhere either!<br />6. The \\"Rookery\\" is where crazy students go. I guess this isn't important, it's just world building.<br />7. Kvothe made that whole trip in book 1 up to see a burnt wedding party, so find Chandrian clues. In this book, he gets a drawing of the Chandrian that a girl sees in her dreams. This is also not really relevant yet, apparently.<br />8. Kvothe invents a super awesome magic arrow defender thing. This is not really important either.<br />9. Those University buddies that Kvothe made? They pretty much disappear into irrelevance.<br />10. The guy that Kvothe plays the game with, when he's hanging out with the Maer? Irrelevant to the plot also.<br />11. The super evil wizard who is poisoning the Maer? Runs away and dies offscreen.<br /><br />Other complaints:<br />Kvothe spends like 250 pages in the forest hunting for bandits. Then he kills them with heretofore-unmentioned super magical killing ability. I guess he was practicing between chapters.<br /><br />The evil magical oracle that Kvothe meets in the hilariously bad Felurian chapters tells Kvothe that the evil bandit leader that he met earlier was none other than CINDER, the evil dude who killed his parents in book 1. Somehow this super powerful demon guy is unable to keep Kvothe from wrecking his bandit camp, and runs away.<br /><br />Anyway, basically this is a \\"shaggy dog story,\\" as mentioned in another review. Save yourself some time and hope that an abridged \\"Classic Literature\\" version comes out in like 100 years or something.<br /><br />I highly doubt that the author will finish this series in just one more book.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|Is Curtis LaForche having a futuristic vision, or is he in the early stages of schizophrenia?<br /><br />That's the question that we keep asking ourselves as we watch TAKE SHELTER, writer-director Jeff Nichols' tense psychological thriller that features an astounding performance by Michael Shannon as Curtis, as well as stellar dramatic turns by the rest of the fine cast.<br /><br />Construction worker Curtis LaForche (Shannon) lives in a small Ohio town with his wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), and their six-year-old, hearing impaired daughter (Tova Stewart).  When Curtis begins having nightmares and hallucinations of a coming apocalyptic storm, he not only builds an expensive storm shelter in his back yard, much to the concern of his family, friends and employer, who eventually fires him, but he also begins to doubt his own sanity, since he mother had fallen victim to schizophrenia years before.<br /><br />Nichols endows his story with a deliberate pace that allows viewers to take the journey with Curtis as, on the one hand, he succumbs to his unnerving \\"visions\\" by building the expanded storm shelter while, on the other, exploring the looming possibility that he is, indeed, losing his sanity like his mother (Kathy Baker) did when she was his age.<br /><br />At times, the slow pacing works against the film, which would probably have been more effective than it is already, were it trimmed by twenty minutes.<br /><br />I don't care how \\"great\\" an individual scene or moment might be.  If the information it conveys is redundant and it slows the overall tempo of the film, then it should go.  That's why \\"God\\" created \\"Deleted Scenes\\" sections on DVDs.<br /><br />Nevertheless, TAKE SHELTER is a fine film with an ending that will definitely have viewers pondering long after the picture has ended.<br /><br />The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains informative and interesting audio commentary by writer/director Jeff Nichols and star Michael Shannon.<br /><br />There are also two deleted scenes, a 10-minute \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurette and a 20-minute Q&A with Shannon and co-star Shea Whigham.<br /><br />© Michael B.

0385523912|5.0|Although often painful to read, this well-written book is very hard to put down. I felt both profound sorrow and boundless admiration for the North Koreans who were interviewed--all defectors, of course. It is illegal for ordinary citizens in North Korea to talk to foreigners, and residents monitor their neighbors and report anyone who misspeaks to the authorities, so they cannot openly express their opinions unless they defect. One of the most moving parts of the book for me was when the starving and desperate pediatrician, Dr. Kim, crossed into China by herself and came upon a small farmhouse in the countryside. In the yard, she saw a bowl filled with white rice and bits of meat for the family dog. Dr. Kim had been barely surviving on scavenged grass, tree bark, and weeds, and she was shocked to discover that even a dog in China ate better than a doctor in North Korea.  Kudos to Barbara Demick for her detailed and painstaking research and her patient, thorough interviews with her subjects. Her kindness and concern for them permeate the book, ad she has done the people of North Korea a great service by illuminating the darkness that is their existence. She has also done me a great service by educating me about this silent and secretive country. I feel fortunate to have discovered this book and will be recommending it to my friends.

0316056863|5.0|I don't think Tina Fey means to make so many points about society.  I think she's telling you how she sees it and if her observations help you along, great; and if not, oh well!  It's admirable and inspiring how she moves beyond the criticism and lives her life.  She is who she is - funny, intelligent, obsessive, panicky, out of place, and loving it.  What other choice is there?!  In short, she's human and I like her all the more because of it. She doesn't claim to be perfect and she cannot offer you a recipe for success.  She acknowledges that support, luck, dedication, and humor play roles; and had things gone differently, Sarah Palin might be president and Tina Fey would still be ignoring the directives of Second City.  This is life and Tina Fey brings humor to it so that we might laugh at ourselves, as well as her.  Great read!  For those of you who don't like Tina Fey, you'll enjoy it too.  She offers so much of herself that you'll surely find something to criticize.  Tina Fey, if you are reading this, please know that I had NO CLUE that you had a scar on your face.  Also, I'm catching reruns of 30 Rock.  It IS a good show! :) So, thanks for bringing it to my attention! And sorry I didn't watch it before.  I'm sure there's a good reason for it...

B005FITIGO|5.0|The rich get richer and the poor get poorer...I heard that somewhere. That's what \\"Margin Call\\" is (mostly) about, and the profound arrogance of corporate greed is well examined, especially by Jeremy Irons' slimy performance. I've read some of the other reviews, some not very favorable, but I was never bored; rather, I found it compelling. This is a film about integrity, either lost or on the fence, and what corporate greed can do to otherwise fine people.<br /><br />Some comedian once said \\"Life is all about ass...either kissing it or getting kicked in it\\". \\"Margin Call\\" gives a bit of insight into some talented men who have lost focus on their humanity. It's more about attitudes than the actual events that are being portrayed.<br />One of the most profound scenes was between Spacey, looking for closure, talking to Irons, pigging out on a steak dinner, smug that he made another billion at the expense of the little guys.<br /><br />Certainly, the ensemble cast of pros is impressive. Spacey and Quinto were particularly fine, but Irons takes the prize. I genuinely hated him. Demi Moore, too, is not to be dismissed. Too bad the fine Mary McDonnell appeared too briefly. She's got class. I'm sure much of her part was cut, since she has almost top billing.<br /><br />Perhaps I enjoyed it more than most. The events weren't as important as the characterizations. I was impressed.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I received my Kindle Fire for Christmas and immediately went searching for a case. I purchased this Marware product because it looked the best and had the best overall reviews. I must say I am very pleased! The case is substantial and gives lots of protection to my Kindle Fire without adding additional weight. As others have said my biggest problem with the Fire is the fingerprint prone screen. However, this product has soft felt on the underside of the cover that seems to clean the screen every time I close it up for the night. I'm sure this was not intentional, but a welcome side-effect nonetheless. I also enjoy the folding cover that converts into a stand. It gives a perfect viewing angle and is easy to set-up in seconds when firing up Netflix.  The only reason why I gave this product 4 stars is because the elastic strap that keeps the cover closed already feels loose and frayed after only a month of use. Not a huge deal, but for the amount of use it has yet to go through I am just not certain it will be able to hold up much longer.  Overall this product is great and I would buy it again in a heartbeat. It gives great protection and maintains the Kindle Fire's sleek, handheld form-factor. Definitely worth the money.
B001NR8F2O|3.0|I agree with The Reverend's assessment, and will add to it.  How is it that \\"Kiss Alive!\\" (Alive I) is the best sounding concert of the five official live albums to date?  I mean this sonically...the overall sound production and mastering of this concert.  Kiss, as musicians, have in fact improved dramatically over the years (Peter's declining skills in later years duly noted).  Why is the sound quality of this one so incredibly poor?  Things had progressed dramatically between 1975 and 2000, yes??  The first 16 tracks of this mp3 sound so distant..virtually no guitar presence, drums like my starter set as a kid.  Ahhh, you ask, what about \\"God Of Thunder\\" (Track 17)?  I'm very much convinced that tune was lifted from another concert (check out the little known \\"Kiss In Las Vegas\\" DVD...I think it was lifted from this show).  Listen to it...the drums are full...the guitars are so present and well-done they bring a tear to your eye!  THAT SONG...THAT SOUND...is KISS!  And there you have it, one masterfully produced tune (sonically) that got slapped on as the last song of this \\"performance\\".  So sad, because the other comments about this album are true.  There are several tunes in this mp3 (\\"Alive:  The Millennium Concert\\") that are MUSICALLY delivered better than ever... it's the sound that just suffers terribly.  In the meantime, we continue to await the delivery of a raw, continuous, unedited performance whose translation to \\"vinyl...CD...mp3...whatever\\" delivers the true band we've loved for 3 decades.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I've had this cover for about a month. Works great.  I take my Kindle Fire with me in my purse and it provides great protection. I watched a few movies and the cover that flips back and inserts in the slot is really nice.  However, it is really easily knocked out.  If you plan on little kids watching movies on it or playing games on it, I doubt it would stay upright.  But for my it was perfect.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game and have not put it down since downloading from the app store. Good time sink IMHO.
B005GVF95O|5.0|I have tons of kids apps but this is the first one my son has ever been interested in. Not just interested, he absolutely loved it.  He hasn't played on a touchscreen so he needed a lot of help at first. He already knew where the simple 1-piece pieces went, it was just a matter of getting there. He was so happy when we clapped at the end.  Someone mentioned it didn't support multi-touch and this is true. It caused some confusion for him at first so I just decided to work on teaching him to &quot;poke&quot;. The app is still really awesome.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this has helped me many times in my studies! easy to use and read, I love the highlighting factor it allows and I will continue to use this app everyday
0060873027|1.0|I could tell exactly where Crichton had left off.  The book was engaging, exciting, and easily readable...just like his other books.  However, at 1/3 of the way through the book, a new section begins.  Actually, a new book begins.  A terrible book.  A book I couldn't even finish.  I really wish they would have found an author who would have held true, not just to the story, but to the writing style of Crichton.  Especially if they are going to tout this as a Crichton book.  Very disappointing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Does everything it says it does. it has all the books  of the bible and all types of bible to get a better understanding while reading the  bible. Gives you the option to choose which type of bible you would lile to choose from.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this app because is free, and you can watch the video and listen to the song. but some music that you choose is not available, which is kind of stupid. when you downloading song it feel that is taking forever. but sometimes it worth it though. I use this app for my kindle fire. so far I recommend this app for the music lovers.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Loved this movie.  Cinematography was cool.  Soundtrack was AMAZING!  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Great cinematic experience; full recommendation.
B006HGXGWU|3.0|\\"You think I'm crazy? Well, listen up, there's a storm coming like nothing you've ever seen, and not a one of you is prepared for it.\\" After a series of nightmares and hallucinations Curtis (Shannon) thinks that he is going insane. After beginning counseling he isn't seeing the effect he wants. Fearing the worst he begins to build a storm shelter for his family. When this causes tension he tries to convince everyone that he is not crazy. This is a very interesting movie. It is a very neat and disturbing idea but at the same time so incredibly slow moving that it is hard to stay interested for most of it. Watching Shannon go from a \\"normal\\" father and husband into what he becomes is very interesting to watch but again seems to take forever to get there. The acting by Shannon is so good that you really begin to feel for him and by the end you actually are hoping he is right. Overall, a movie that has a neat idea but needed something else to make the movie as good as the idea. I do have to say that the ending makes watching the movie worth it though. I give it a B-.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Ok everybody this is a great book! I don't care wat all u people say cause id like to c u write a better book! Also WHO CARES IF UR BOOK IZ DAMIGED OR IF IT HAS INK SMUDGED ON IT! Dont blame it on the book! Its a great book and all u readers should at least give it a chance!!!!!! Listen to me not the one star review ppl
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I found that this product not as easy to use as I had thought it would be. It does not stay in the groove as well as I would like when placed on a flat surface.
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|A cheap model but nice , well built and cool ! It looks like an expensive brand but it is an actual bargain . Recommended .
B0059XTUMC|5.0|A fantastic movie.  I just saw it and already I'm pre-ordering it.  Jean Dujardin and Uggie the dog is are wonderful together.
B00005K3O4|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Truly an imaginative, hilarious, sometimes disturbing, sci-fi horror black comedy, cult classic.<br /><br />The \\"Klowns\\" make up is impressive for such a low budget affair, & their certainly inventive of ways to capture the hapless human victims for a snack later, LOL!<br /><br />Cotton candy anyone?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it is really fun also the games are a little bit hard other then that its alsome. I LOVE IT SO MUCH :)
B00081ELHY|5.0|Great record, packaged and shipped nicely, and I really like the poster that comes with the album. This is definitely something every Coldplay lover must have!
B005NQ5LSC|4.0|This movie has a LOT of action, quality is great, story is a little boring (hence the 4 stars) but, after all, it's about the IP Man and his legendary battles...watch it now!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|As a long-time Leonard Cohen fan, it is quite remarkable to see that this great new CD is currently Amazon's #1 seller. If you check out Apple's iTunes  Top 10 charts, it is either #1, 2 or 3 in almost every country. Cohen newbies will not be aware of the fact that his albums have almost never reached the heights  in terms of sales. But something has changed - maybe a record company that has actually promoted him, or a public that is finally prepared to pay attention to music that goes beyond the usual happy pop formula.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game...way too addicting. it just makes you. wanna pass all the levels and get as many points possible to open up new games
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I find that with the current Media available there is too much sex, too many drugs, too much alcohol and far too stupid people. John Green produced another book that reminds me of the intelligent youth. It tells the story of two intelligent youths put in the position where they are dying of cancer and turns into a romance that is rushed into the desperate need to be loved teenagers feel. The sex was sweet, non-graphic, and non-rushed as it should have been for a young adult novel. The love was real and the parents were depicted as intelligent loving caring people who were dealing with the very real situation of their children having cancer and the inevitable consequences of cancer. I give this book five stars without being a nerdfighter but knowing what they are. I read books, it's what I do and I enjoyed this one without compromise.
B0063IH60K|5.0|There is never a boring moment during commercials when watching television.  I just turn on my Kindle Fire and play my favorite game of solitaire.  These Apps are so easy to use.  Very cleverly done. A lot of fun.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|This is, basically, the final series of the Tenth Doctor...and it is brilliant. This is the Doctor alone (or as alone as he ever gets), spiraling out to the end. It's Ten as you've never seen him before, unraveling and powerful and at the very height of Time Lord arrogance and the lowest depths of lonely despair. The Master returns, we get a surprising glimpse of Gallifrey that those unfamiliar with the original \\"Who\\" have never seen before, and the Doctor bids a final farewell to his friends. (And \\"Waters of Mars\\" is, in my opinion, one of the most perfect stories ever told, albeit heartbreaking now due to the how unlikely it is that we will achieve the future depicted in the time allotted. But that's beside the point, which is: watch and revel.) If you've enjoyed Tennant's run as Ten, and you haven't yet watched his final stories, you are missing the most beautiful final chapters, and you should remedy that problem as quickly as possible. The Doctor's finale is one of the greatest farewells to a character that I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and I cannot imagine how one could possibly find it disappointing.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It has been awhile since I had trouble putting a book down!  This was so realistically written I was actually starting to get a little afraid of the dark.  It was not over-overpowering with zombies, not cheesy at all.  So now I am reading the \\"survival guide\\"
B006W0QOF2|3.0|I was torn between a 2 and a 3 for Drive...so I'll call it a 2 1/2. I usually like Ryan Gosling in movies, but he bugged me a little in this one...especially for the first...third or so.  I think he was going for the \\"James Dean effect\\" with long silent pauses after anyone spoke to him.  Sometimes I found myself holding my breath waiting for him to say something and thinking...\\"talk already,\\" I'm tired of waiting for you.  In a movie titled \\"Drive,\\" which is about a stunt driver that is also a getaway driver, you might think that there would be some creative car chases. There's one chase early in the movie, and I kept thinking...\\"ok any minute now...he's going for it,\\" but it never happened...the scene was anti-climatic...there's a slightly better one later, but really nothing memorable or ground breaking.  Then, there's and inexplicable scene where Gosling's character kills a guy in a pretty excessive way in front of the girl that he likes. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the violent scene.  It just didn't fit that the cool, brooding and quiet character, would get so extreme in front of his girl friend.  It was a little weird.  The story is OK, but they let it get a little thin and I think they let the viewer slip away some.  Yeah, I think two and a half stars is fair. It was worth watching...but not by much.
B004EPZ084|1.0|I found nothing the slightest bit amusing about this movie... I even gave it a second try thinking I was tired the first time I watched it...but wide awake I still couldn't get thru this slapstik movie...I don't know what to say about it, except it did absolutely nothing for me, I didn't even give a small haha...It was a very childish type movie, something that kids would find amusing...
0307959856|1.0|I've avoided the glut of updates on Jane Austen, but thought PD James might write something worth reading. I was wrong. The plot was uninteresting, the characters likewise, and the coy parroting of some of Austen's memorable phrases is annoying. I wish I hadn't read this book.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|I've seen most of Ryan Reynolds' movies and they are fairly tame, this movie on the other hand, is comparative to the lewdness of The Hangover 2.  Do not watch this with anyone you might be embarrased of seeing graphic nudity with or hearing shocking sexual references. The dialogue is so shocking and offensive that I spent half the movie with my jaw dropped. This is not a script I would have expected either main actor to gravitate towards but I guess I was wrong. It really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I appreciated the first Hangover with all it's graphic content but this is just too much.  Do not waste your time, you will feel gross after watching it.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have a nice modern turntable, though it doesn't have a built in speaker and it only has two aux cables. I managed to find a aux audio input extension and when I plugged my headphones in I could barely hear anything (this is on some Bose headphones, not some cheap thing). I finally found what I have been looking for, the FiiO E5 is perfect for amplifying my turntable to my headphones. Obviously the sound isn't totally \\"crystal clear\\", so an you get the whole full blown vinyl sound from this. Now I listen to a lot of heavy music from metal, drone, industrial, hardcore, noise, etc, so the FiiO hooked up to my iPod works great for me. The volume and mass of the sound from the music is intensely amplified and that's what I want. I can hear everything so much clearer, especially in very layered kind of music like post-rock/metal and drone based music. The battery life is pretty decent, and charging it is very easy. All you have to do is use the special USB cable which is provided and hook it up to your computer/laptop and let it charge until the red light goes away. I really do recommend this, especially to those who love to listen to LP's.
B005TPCQ5I|5.0|If this movie doesn't tug at your heart strings then I don't know what will. I didn't know what to expect but this movie was truly great. You have to pay attention to this movie, try not to get distracted by other things while watching it.  Yes Anne Hathway's British accent is not perfect but trust me, you will not be sorry you watched this.  Great love story with twists and turns! This is a must see.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|LOVE Pink! And I was not disapointed with this STUNNING video, I LOVED every minute of it. Made me definately want to attend one of her concerts in real life when she comes! LOVED all her bandmates and dancers, just a visual feast for the eyes as well. LOVED Bohemian Rhapsody! Loved the behind the scenes footage...just an incredible video and worth every penny!!!
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|This prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 classic remake of the 1951 original is much better than I expected.  The movie is faithful to Carpenter's version and maintains its eerie atmospheric tension.  A major disappointment is that some of the key scenes are filmed so dark, you miss what's going on.  But the effects are well done and I like Marco Beltrami's haunting score.<br />The cast is good, especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead's reluctant heroine, Joel Edgerton as the American pilot and Eric Christian Olsen's doleful lab assistant.<br />While not as effective as Carpenter's masterpiece, this prequel is a very good horror movie and I recommend it.  Perhaps a double feature would be fun!!!
1439170916|4.0|This is a well-structured and thoughtfully written history of cancer treatment, focusing for obvious reasons on the last hundred years. The drama develops between the knives and the poisons, with genetic research giving a boost to the poisons side in the last decade. A pleasure.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I'm giving this game 5 stars before I even purchase it. Based on the reviews I've read. I plan to write this review, then I'm going to purchase both games by Fire Maple Games. I don't care how short this game is, it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun. There is only one review on the other game, but if it's anything like this  one sounds, it's going to be a blast too. I'll be back to leave another review on how much I like them. I don't mind paying .99 cents for this game (no matter how short) then paying another $1.99 for the other game. They both sound like a lot of fun (my kind of fun). When I'm done I know my grandson will love them as well, so in my mind, it's well woth the money. Well I'm gone now to buy my games, and have some fun. I'll be back in a day or so to let you know just how much fun they are. Thank you Fire Maple Games.
B000001Y9I|4.0|After the recent album, The Battle Rages On, Ritchie Blackmore left once again and Steve Morse joined the band. Purpendicular is quite different from the earlier albums before it. New musical arrangements are found, while the melodies are given a more complex touch. As a result, the album is a couple of notches down what can be expected from a Deep Purple album. Not to say that Purpendicular is bad; it's just that some of the songs aren't very memorable. Songs like \\"Loosen my Strings\\" and \\"Soon Forgotten\\" are easily forgettable. However, there are some very good things about this album. \\"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\\" is easily one of DP's finest moments with its broad poetic melodies and meaningful lyrics. \\"The Aviator\\" is another huge hit with its experimental tendencies (half of the time, it sounds like an American country song).<br /><br />So there are some great moments in Purpendicular, but there are some bad ones as well. Some of the songs may be forgettable, but at least there are others that still prove that Deep Purple still had it in the 90's.<br /><br />Grade: 7.8 out of 10<br /><br />Also from Deep Purple<br />In Rock (10 out of 10)<br />Fireball (9.1 out of 10)<br />Machine Head (10 out of 10)<br />Who Do We Think We Are (9.4 out of 10)<br />Burn (8.1 out of 10)<br />Stormbringer (9.8 out of 10)<br />Come Taste the Band (9.5 out of 10)<br />Perfect Strangers (7.7 out of 10)<br />The House of Blue Light (7.9 out of 10)<br />Slaves and Masters (9.2 out of 10)<br />The Battle Rages On (8.8 out of 10)
159514188X|1.0|My teenage daughter bought this book to read, after a friend (who had only read the first few pages while browsing in a bookstore, so hadn't seen the content past that) said it looked good. The back cover portrays the book as a mystery novel, which appealed to my daughter since she enjoys reading mysteries. Right after my daughter bought it, I sat down and looked through it. I was shocked and disgusted at the graphic sexual content throughout the book...a book that's being recommended for 12 years and up. There are many effective and appropriate ways that the issues of bullying and sexual pressure can be addressed to young women, without writing a fictional book that goes into graphic sexual detail. I honestly find it very disturbing that it's an adult male author writing about sexual things being done to and being engaged in by a teenage girl, using the first-person voice of a teenage girl to describe those sexual incidents in detail. This is one book that's going straight back to the store.
0811879542|5.0|I'm definitely wondering why I didn't think of that.  This book is interactive, interesting, fun, and yet very simple.  It could have been made at home, and yet it's very well done.  It would be fun for classes to make similar books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is a lot of fun &amp; offers a lot of variety. it's fun trying to beat your high score.

0060873027|3.0|Jurassic Park meets Honey I Shrunk the Kids. That's the best way I can describe this final offering from the mind of Michael Crichton. Micro was an unfinished manuscript Crichton had been working on when he passed away from cancer in 2008. It was finished by Richard Preston, brother of Douglas Preston, who wrote The Cobra Event, and The Hot Zone. I've enjoyed books by both authors and I think Preston was an excellent choice to finish Crichton's story.  Seven graduate students have come to Hawaii to look into working for Nanigen, an obscure, high-tech company that's at the cutting edge of medical research and nano-technology. Nanigen claims the ability to construct tiny robots, some of which are mere millimeters in diameter. They use these robots to perform research, gathering samples in the microbiological world in order to develop new medications.  What these students learn when they arrive is that Nanigen's technology isn't in creating these minuscule robots. Their technology is far more advanced and dangerous - it shrinks things, and not just the robots it builds, it can shrink anything: robots, equipment, scientists, and graduate students. Unfortunately for the students, they're shrunk against their will having uncovered the sinister side of Nanigen's psychopathic president.  The idea behind the story is outlandish, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment in reading it. The world is a far more dangerous place when you're half an inch tall and have to survive in the Hawaiian forest. Crichton (and Preston) do a great job of creating a sense of what that world would be like and creating the same level of fear for me that I felt for T. rexes and velociraptors only this time they did it with birds, wasps, spiders, and ants.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I used to take a sound machine machine with me everywhere I traveled, now I have one less thing to pack.  Awesome!
1568363931|4.0|Love every aspect about this book. I have nothing negative with what is actually in the book. I would only hope for a few more mainstream American food. I think it would make my wife more comfortable cooking some of these menus.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great game. pleasant to play. can move cards very smoothly. very pleased. can't complain about anything even if I try to.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Much bigger than I thought, despite having read all the reviews! Barely fits onto my Foxconn motherboard for Gateway DX4300 model. Keeps my CPU less than or at 100F, even under a pretty decent load--highest I've seen so far is 130F, but it will idle around 80F. The fan made me nervous since I have a 3-pin, rather than a 4-pin which the fan requires--it did not begin spinning on first start up until the CPU reached about 125F. I am going to have to be creative with my case, as it does not fully close with this heat sink. The stick of RAM closest to the CPU runs hot--about 30F hotter than the other three sticks. Amazing product for the price!
B006OT03BM|5.0|Arrived on release day, the set looks good and a must for any fan or collector. The negative reviews posted by others before the product was even released are ridiculous. I did not own the previous two on blu-ray, so this was a great value. Throw in a signature and the spiffy box and you have a great deal. When sold out and no longer available, watch the value skyrocket.
B006DICWUE|4.0|Brand new NS fan here...I must admit I only knew these guys from the trendy alternahit 'popular' back in the 90s, so I went ahead and heard this album without any preconceptions of their sound and aesthetics and by jolly gosh, they blew me away with each and every song, I don't know if it's their trademark but it's like beatles for a new generation!! its infectious, jangly guitars and mesmerizing vocal melodies are pleasing for a nice ride or a day at the office, nothing fancy or contrived just a good old rock album with a dash of pop for good measure...hasn't left my playlist for quite a while...totally recommended!! plus, it's well recorded and produced, none of that 'loudness wars' nonsense in here, so your ears won't feel tired after hearing it several times like I know you will!! Enjoy! -pupo<br /><br />Update 4/2: \\"I wonder what was that world I was dreaming of...\\" -When I was young, I guarantee it will stick like peanut butter to your brain for days...

1451648537|4.0|First, I admire this man tremendously except for his inability to show compassion and understanding to anyone. Even though Mr. Isaacson was able to interview many people for this book, there had to be some restrictions on content. In a way I look at this as Jobs being able to confess publicly how he viewed himself. Future books about Mr. Jobs will be more interesting into the real creativity and intelligence that Steve had and how he was able to get his empoyees to drive themselves so hard and how they were able to be so determined and committed to create such beautiful and (magical) products. I began following Mr. Jobs when he came back to Apple. I was into computers very little.  His products have converted me to going from a 3rd generation iPod to an iTouch to an iPhone and when available an iPad3.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Don't be put off by the Hollywood patina. This is a racer's movie. The semi-documentary style brings you right on the track. I enjoyed it very much, and cannot recommend this highly enough.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Excellent product. Great end to a great series. Well done to the writers who completely tied all the story lines from all previous seasons. Very well done!
B005K8QIS0|4.0|\\"Case Histories,\\" a television series of British mysteries/police procedurals, is based on the popular novels by Kate Atkinson.  It was made by BBC Scotland, which intelligently moved the action from Yorkshire, where Atkinson had set it, to Edinburgh, Scotland; a more beautiful and interesting place.  In the U.K., this series was aired in twin one hour episodes on consecutive nights. This resulted in two episodes each of three single dramas, each crime drama based upon one particular Atkinson book that run approximately one hour 55 minutes each. Each drama has a mini-climax at the end of the first part, as well as at the end of the story arc.  And, thank goodness, for most of us not so conversant with Scottish dialog and usage, Acorn Media, the American releasing company, has kindly given us subtitles.<br /><br />Our detective here is Jackson Brodie (Golden Globe® nominee Jason Isaacs, [[ASIN:B000KF0DVQ The State Within]], who was a soldier in the British army, then an officer in the Lothian and Borders Police, an entity that will ring bells to any enthusiasts of Ian Rankin's Rebus novels, and TV series, as indeed, will Edinburgh itself.  However, the indefatigable detective has left the police for various reasons unspecified in the TV treatment, and turned private investigator.  His tough exterior hides the famous heart of gold, and he finds himself compelled to try to help all comers, looking into everything from lost cats and lost girls - many lost girls --to wayward spouses and killers on the run. He also does a lot of running himself, partly to unwind from the stresses of his work, but seemingly mostly to brood upon his own traumatic past.<br /><br />In the U.S., this series was recently seen on Masterpiece Mystery.  This \\"more than successful adaptation\\" (The Guardian, U.K.) of Atkinson's award-winning novels also stars Amanda Abbington, ([[ASIN:B002PNU13G After You've Gone - Series One]]); Natasha Little,([[ASIN:B001FBPSWS Another Life]]); Phil Davis, ([[ASIN:B0007P0YKY Vera Drake]]); Sylvia Simms,([[ASIN:B000053VAR Alice's Restaurant]]), and Keith Allen (ROBIN HOOD). It was created for television by Ashley Pharaoh of [[ASIN:B001XRLWLU Life on Mars: The Complete Series]].  It is a character-driven drama boasting an outstanding lead performance by Isaacs, who apparently was born to play brooding, handsome heroes.  And it's all set against the ruggedly beautiful Scottish scenery.<br /><br />Episode 1 is based upon [[ASIN:0316033480 Case Histories: A Novel]] and boasts three subplots.  As Brodie searches for one of the cats of his crotchety client Binky Rain (Sylvia Simms), he stumbles across the 30-year old mystery of a little girl who disappeared from the house next door. The girl's sisters, Julia (Natasha Little) and Amelia Land have found their little sister's stuffed toy, Blue Mouse, while going through their deceased father's things, where it ought not to be. A distraught Theo Wyre (Phil Davis) barges into Brodie's office to beg him to look into the murder of his daughter Laura, as he doesn't have confidence in the police investigation. And a manipulative nurse, Shirley Manning, wants him to find the niece who was put into foster care years ago.<br /><br />Episode 2, based upon[[ASIN:0316012823 One Good Turn: A Novel]], finds Brodie, while out for one of his jogs, discovering the body of a young woman floating in the ocean.  As he tries to establish her identity, he traces her to a Russian-owned and staffed maid service where the staff are afraid to speak to him. Meanwhile, Brodie witnesses a man brutally beaten in a multi-story  parking lot, in an apparent episode of road rage that has morphed into a mugging. Fortunately, a bystander, mystery writer Martin Canning tosses his laptop at the assailant, probably saving the victim's life. But the cowardly mystery writer fears retaliation and insists that Brodie must protect him. And Gloria Hatter's captain of industry husband has just had a heart attack while glorying in the company of his Russian immigrant dominatrix Tatiana. As the master of the universe lays dying unconscious in a hospital bed, his wife finds  that their company Hatter Homes is under investigation, as are her husband's other holdings, and an employee of his, Terence Smith might well be up to no good. Just by coincidence, the three cases turn out to be one.<br /><br />Episode 3, based upon [[ASIN:B00342VG5Y When Will There Be Good News?: A Novel]]  begins as Brodie works an adultery case.

1439152799|5.0|Kate Morton's books are just amazing.  She has a wonderful descriptive talent, and it's easy for readers to relate to her characters.  This book, as with her other books, left me unable to stop reading until I was finished.  I love how she is able to weave together the historical parts of the story with the modern aspects and cleanly tie up all the loose ends.  Excellent, excellent read.

B006VRZ5YM|4.0|When I saw the trailers for this movie, I really wanted to watch it. However, \\"Rotten Tomatoes\\" put me off it. It got only 28% votes! But when I saw it on Amazon Instant Videos, I knew I'd rent it. I am glad I did. I watched it with a girlfriend, after a long day at work, expecting a crappy movie. But I was presently surprised. I found myself laughing quite hard at several points in the movie. Yes, the story is predictable in terms of plot. But Anna Faris is simply brilliant in terms of comic timing. The jokes in the script are good. And I absolutely love the wedding vows that the sister character and her husband say to each other. I'd say WATCH. This movie is for gals who like toilet humor especially! I highly recommend it.
B0070Z97LG|4.0|`Once upon a time, there were two little girls who lived in a house.'  Entering into the realm of this film written by David Loucka and directed by Jim Sheridan (In America, The Boxer, In the Name of the Father, The Field, My Left Foot, etc.) is more of a challenge than the viewer is ready to understand. The apparent story is so tightly written that all of the elements of the real story are placed before our eyes, but as in so many life instances, what we think we see and understand is a mirage: the story being told is occult until the film is over.  Similar films that use this technique include The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island, and The Others.  Sharpen your observational skills and this film will be extremely satisfying.<br /><br />Opening with a New York City farewell party for writer Will Atenton  (Daniel Craig) who is leaving his high paying job to spend more time with his family, we soon find Will in front of his dream house in the New England where is beautiful and passionate wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and his two young daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare) are in the process of fixing up an old deserted house.  Some strange things happen - as in all good ghost thrillers -  and soon enough Will learns that the house has been vacant for five years because of some heinous murders.  A neighbor across the street - Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), seemingly estranged from her husband Jack (Marton Csokas) who is attempting to gain sole guardianship of their daughter Chloe (Rachel Fox) - visits and shares with Will some of the grisly details.  At this point the story begins to unwrap the real situation of Will's identity and the real history of the house of memories.  To share more story would be unfair to the impact of the illusion of this film.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is superb as Will, and Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts are excellent, as are the supporting actors which in addition to Koteas and Csokas include Jane Alexander in a pivotal cameo role.  What appears to be an enigma at first is resolved with great skill.  A thinking person's movie, this.  Grady Harp February 12enigma at first is resolved with great skill.

B00637HXNG|5.0|I also picked this up last week at a big box chain as an exclusive release.  I do not have a 3D TV, but it plays perfect with stunning picture quality in regular 2D mode.  The audio is perfect (it's perfectly in sync with the video and the mix is great).  The performance is awesome, and best of all, the camera work is really great (no hyper fast editing like on most modern concert videos).  This Blu-ray is extremely well done in all respects.  If you're a fan of the Scorpions, definitley pick this one up.

B005N0PJJO|3.0|FIFTY SHADES DARKER by E L James.<br /><br />This is graphic BDSM erotic romance.  There is no paranormal.  There are no vampires.<br /><br />If you're considering my opinion on this book, please read my review of book 1, Fifty Shades of Grey.  I didn't want to duplicate that review here, but it applies.<br /><br />This is book 2 in a trilogy.  You must read book 1 before this.  Both books are longer than average.  The first book had the couple meet and get to know each other.  Book 1 ends with a conflict, and the couple is apart.  This book starts with Ana grieving over their break up, and then they get back together.  Most of this story is Ana questioning and worrying about how Christian feels.<br /><br />This is an erotic story, filled with many lengthy sex scenes.  There is bondage, spanking, sex toys, and one instance of rear door activity.<br /><br />These stories were originally written on the fan fiction website under Twilight.  The characters' names were Edward and Bella.  The author changed the names to Christian and Ana for this ebook publication.  I can see how Twilight fans loved being in that world and were eager for almost any story about Edward and Bella.  In that sense this was probably very satisfying.  But as an independent story, it didn't do much for me.  About 2/3 the way through I was impatient for it to be over.  I was not interested enough to read book 3 (Fifty Shades Freed).  So I was delighted that another reviewer summarized the book 3 plot for me so I could know what happened without spending time to read it.  If you are interested, see the second comment below.  Several reviewers were unhappy with book 3.<br /><br />CAUTION SPOILERS:<br />There is a lot of angst and worry on Ana's part.  She is jealous and feels insecure when Christian interacts with women from his past.  She thinks he needs BDSM toys and sadism to enjoy sex.  She believes they are incompatible, and that she will never be able to give him what he needs.  He keeps saying no that's not true.  Christian is jealous and takes action when other men are interested in Ana.  For conflict, the author added a couple of characters doing threatening things.  Those were ok, but they felt like add-ins rather than part of an overall plot plan.  One of the draws of the book might be watching Christian spend lots of money living an expensive lifestyle.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Kindle count story length: 10,495 (1776 KB).

B0052U59F4|3.0|FIFTY SHADES OF GREY by E L James.<br /><br />This is graphic BDSM erotic romance.  There is no paranormal.  There are no vampires.<br /><br />COMPARING THIS TO TWILIGHT:<br />This story was originally written on the fan fiction website for Twilight.  The main characters are the Twilight characters with new names.  The difference between the heroes is that Edward is a vampire and Christian is human.  Christian wants to cause pain to Ana.  Later he fights his desire to hurt her.  Edward never wanted to cause pain, but his vampire nature would, so Edward fights his vampire desires.  Ana/Bella is so drawn to Christian/Edward that she is willing to put herself in danger to be with him.<br /><br />When I read Twilight, I had wonderful feelings of love and desire.  With this book, I felt insecure and unsettled.  My feelings weren't as good.  Part of the problem might be that Ana had to suffer physical pain from Christian and worried about Christian's feelings for her.  Bella did not suffer physical pain and did not worry about Edward's love for her.<br /><br />In Fifty Shades, most of the mystery and conflict is Ana pondering her feelings and fears and wondering what Christian's feelings are and whether he can ever change.  That's not enough plot for me.  Twilight had more plot.<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />Christian Grey is a self-made billionaire through corporate mergers and acquisitions.  He was physically abused early in life.  Therefore he needs to cause pain to women during sex.  He calls himself fifty shades of f***ed up, thus the title.  He is in his late 20s.  He meets Ana who is a senior in college.  She is a virgin.  They are drawn to each other.  He tells her she should stay away from him because he is dangerous.  His past relationships have been with submissive women.  He has a room in his home with BDSM equipment: floggers, whips, bondage contraptions,etc.  Ana calls this the Red Room of Pain.  Christian wants Ana to be his submissive.  He intends to control every aspect of her life including what she eats, when and how much she exercises and sleeps, etc.  She is willing to try.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />This is book 1 in a three book series.  Book 1 stops in the middle of a conflict.  There is nothing resolved or concluded.  You will be left hanging.  So, if you're halfway through the book and you like it, go ahead and order book 2.<br /><br />This is told in first person by Ana.  Most of the plot is Ana's emotional angst about their relationship, loving him, wanting him, being jealous of women in his past, worrying if he loves her or not, worrying about why he seems cold and distant, wanting him to change, worried about whether she will be able to accept the BDSM sex and pain.  She yearns for a normal relationship where she can touch him, but he won't let her touch him.  When they have sex, he holds her hands still or ties them.  One mystery is what happened to cause Christian to be this way.  He doesn't want to tell her, but eventually she learns a little about it.  The main mystery is will they keep seeing each other, and will he do some of the normal things that Ana wants.  Outside of that there is no plot.  He is jealous when he sees other men interested in Ana.  He spends huge amounts of money on her which she is reluctant to accept.<br /><br />I think the main draw for many readers is that Christian obsessively pays attention to Ana.  He does all kinds of things to give her pleasure, both in and out of sex.  He shows intense and constant need, want, and desire for her.  He's always worried about her health and well being, asking her how she is eating and sleeping.<br /><br />Whenever Ana feels insecure about their relationship, all she has to do is look at him.  She sees this elegant, beautiful, Greek god, and then she forgets whatever was bothering her.  Every woman who sees him, is drawn to him.  Other characters are also beautiful: Ana, her roommate Kate, Kate's brother, Christian's brother and other family members.  There are no quirky or unusual personalities in this book.  I suppose that's not a problem, but I noticed it.<br /><br />This is an erotic story, filled with many sex scenes.  They are emotionally intense.  There is some pretty good lust.  There is bondage, whipping, spanking, and sex toys.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Kindle count story length: 10,512 (1,291 KB).  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.
