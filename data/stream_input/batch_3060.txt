B0064X7FVE|5.0|Have had the weather channel app for a while now, and could not be more informed about the conditions in my area, great app, thanks weather channel!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Do far I've been able to pull several videos into my galaxy to pass the lunch hour away. Good quality and easy to use.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Well known app lives up to it's name, each time I play happy to spend time right here at the candy store!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Of the three books it is certainly the less interesting one, I think partly because most of it is not set in the City but in what comes across as a more normal and less lyrical place.  On the writing, I have to agree with other reviewers that the two view points sound so similar that the only clue as to who was talking was whether the first person narrator talked about the other main character as &#34;him&#34; or &#34;her&#34;. Not very good writing there. I don't mind the end - although that may be because I am no longer a &#34;young&#34; adult. In some ways it would be inconsistent with the character if the original plan had gone through and the whole scene made a lot of sense.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally this game is available on the Kindle! This is a very addicting game!  I just wish you did not have to pay for boosters or additional lives.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Awesome movie.  The special effects are the best in the business. I usually don't like 3D movies, but I'm glad I purchased this movie in 3D
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think it is good on the Kindle except it seems slower than on the iPhone. Otherwise it works fine.
B00B2DSK06|3.0|I really want to like this movie. I love the concept of using video game characters and their little worlds. However this movie could be better. Some parents may not like that there is a scene with Satan. And more horrifying is the zombies heart being torn out. We had this movie on our DVRr but eventually my kids started asking me to fast forward that part. It was way to violent and graphic for the. I really hate the music especially the \\"shut up and drive song\\". And its really annoying that my kids can not even sing along since they know not to use those words. Also there is a lot of name calling. Really bad name calling. The Hero's duty video game is horrible too. I get having jokes for adults to enjoy the movie too but I think that they go way too far. So for now I'm deleting this from our DVR. Maybe when my kids are a little bit older I will purchase it but not now. I'm so happy I never bought this.The main character is really cute though and I like that Ralph sets out to make more of his life. So all in all yes there are a lot of teachable moments but if your kids are really young or very sensitive or at an age where they repeat everything then you may not want to get it just now
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book warms your heart with the happiness and knowledge that true love exists and then crushes it at the same time as you read about cancer riddled children. Read in one day; could not put it down.
B00D48BT5A|3.0|I have read most of Bryson's books with relish. But having read both &#34;House&#34; and &#34;One summer&#34;,  I am missing his humour and originality.  The last two books come over as &#34;WikiBryson&#34;.  Interesting detail, but lacking warmth.  Quite boring in parts, to be honest!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not the best written. Lots of repeats. Liked this one better then the 1st  .  More romance and real.  Rate a ,C ++
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another excellent story by Mr. King. I, too, am guilty of wondering where and what little Danny Torrence was up too.  Now I'm hoping to read more about Abra.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Interesting read.  If you are a fan of his previous work or superhero type stuff in general you should like this book.  The action is basically non-stop and character development is top-notch.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|This figure is so amazing!  The detail is really good and it looks even better in person than pictures show.  I thought I would be sad that you cant pose him but nope!  He sits on my desk next to my other figures and looks cool - just like the real goku.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I didn't read the original release when it came out, but I have read some of his previous work.  This one is very well written and his take on the Gods is very unique.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is so much fun!! I have always been a Bejeweled fan, and did not expect to get so hyped about candy crush....but it is Awesome!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|A long read but well worth it.  I've actually read it three times now waiting for the next in the series.<br /><br />Lots of good character development/plot twists, etc.<br /><br />Sanderson writes action very well and he does it particularly well in this book.<br /><br />The magic system is very interesting and I can't wait for it to be expanded on in the sequels.<br /><br />Some slow parts are with the girl, but they get interesting pretty quickly.<br /><br />There is a ton of very graphic and awful violence.  If you've read his books in the past you know what I'm talking about as it seems to be a common theme in them, but seeing the characters rise above it is good.<br /><br />I highly recommend it if you are a Sanderson fan, a fan of Fantasy, or if you just want a good long book.
B005PK553C|5.0|I really just &#34;stumbled&#34; upon this show this year (season 3).  So once bitten, of course I had to get caught up on season's one and two.  I don't really watch very much tv, (Game of Thrones is the only other show I follow) but this has become my absolute favorite.  Season one is very gory and the images are mentally shocking (?).  I'm sure that is the creator's intentions.  I haven't been able to get completely caught up watching season one because there is only so much shocking imagery I can watch and process before having to take a break.  All in all, from the 6 or 7 episodes I have finished watching, the show is superbly done.  I've always thought Jessica Lange was an excellent actress, but she absolutely shines in this show.<br /><br />I didn't really read any synopsis on American Horror Story before watching, but I finally clued in that the central characters revolve around hauntings caused by famous brutal and gory murders throughout history in the area.  Season one is set in Los Angeles and touches upon several famous murders that happened in California (i.e. Black Dahlia, etc.).  (season 3 is in New Orleans....sorry, haven't watched season 2 yet)<br /><br />I've read that television is in entering a new &#34;golden age&#34; (where else can tv go but up, after reality shows?).  If that is true, American Horror Story is one of the shows that is putting it there.  A+ acting, writing, and imagery that keeps you engaged with the story and on the edge of your seat.  Guess what I'll be watching on Halloween?  LOL
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This is an amazing band!  They got semi popular with the release of 'Sail', but they have so many of great songs on this CD.  Every one is very good.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Most of it is up-beat music, but they do slow it down with a couple songs.  The final song even has some rapish type stuff on it (from guests, I'm assuming as it's not the lead singer that does the rapping) that works very well with the lead singer doing other singing parts.<br /><br />Again if you haven't heard this album yet go out and get it now, you won't regret it!  And hopefully their new one should be out soon.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I had purchased a speedlight at Wal-Mart as a last minute option for a shoot I was having. I couldn't get it to work. So I made the decision to try it again and purchased this one. I love it. It does what I need to and I love the looks of my photos that I have taken while using this!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A nice follow up novel to The Shining.  A very fast read that expands upon previous concepts touched upon in the Shining.  Mr King shows once again why he his one of the true master's of his craft.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie and good graphics.  I think they are improving 3d all the time so you depends what your comparing it with.  But, the movie itself is great.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Fantastic Movie.<br /><br />Well worth the price.  However the package I got from Amazon had my DVD broken in the case-cracked completely in half.  The BR works fine (no scratches or anything), but the DVD was broken.  I dunno if this is common, but just beware.<br /><br />Other than that, I'd recommend this.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|This movie rocked. Great action. Great effects. Interesting story. Funny. I was surprised to find that this was my favorite blockbuster of the year.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|This book wasn't very good.  The first book was very interesting, but this one is mostly just the main character sitting around doing nothing.  The girl decides to pretty much ignore him completely so that dynamic is pretty much gone most of the book.  Although he does meet someone else, their relationship is not as interesting as his was with the 'witch girl'.<br /><br />Very disappointing sequel.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|You like action this is the movie. I would have saw it sooner if they had a better trailer showing in the beginning.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun to play but won't let you daub your numbers when it gets close to zero bingos. It has not excepted a lot of my bingos & numbers. Therefore gets very frustrating...
B00DMEQP46|1.0|I am 30 years old and  I think this new music coming out is making me question my sanity. I was expecting something with some type of a beat that resembled pop music, but if this is called \\"pop\\" I must not have a clue. Between the \\"Indie\\" and \\"folk revival\\" revolution compiled with this \\"pop\\" junk really makes me wonder who thinks this is good. Is this inspiring, it makes we want to punch my monitor, but that is probably what I get for growing up when \\"alternative\\" was good and didn't have a bunch of filler at the beginning of every song.  What a waste of time with half of the songs made of of what I think of is at least a minute of intro sounding like misc noise crap \\"traffic sounds or some junk\\". Well at least The Muse is putting out decent music. I'll keep hoping these new pop indie bands like MGMT, and The Killers can start putting out good catchy music again that makes me want to dance instead of wondering what kind of downers they are on.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Nothing to say but well worth the wait. Read it in two days. Could not put it down. The bad part? Only that it ended! Loved this book and the writing was, as always, superb.
159463176X|4.0|If you liked The Kite Runners and his other book, you will enjoy this.  Interesting information about life in Afghanistan some years ago.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|My 6yr old granddaughter and 4yr old grandson both love this game.  They would play it for hours if I would let them.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite Stephen King books. And I have read them all of his work.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|OK, while I was fascinated by this book in the first half, I did remember why I put it down at the library a year ago: so much repetition. As other reviewers have pointed out.<br /><br />I read it this week and OK folks, nothing but spoilers in this review.<br /><br />Why did Claire not say she had been in touch with the son Adam over the years? After all, she and Christine had not talked in ages, so they were catching up. Oh, because the author still wanted Christine to believe her son was dead.<br /><br />Why didn't Claire immediately call the police or come over once she realized Christine was living with an impostor? Oh, because the author wanted to send Christine into yet another potential death situation.<br /><br />Why didn't Christine tell her best friend Claire more about her affair and her lover and his name--after all, Claire said, \\"We never lie to one another.\\"<br /><br />And oops, Ben was in Italy and never, ever keeping track of the wife he unexpectedly divorced (\\"because it would be better\\") and never checking up on her and then professing his love at the end of the novel? Oh please. That truly was one of the weakest parts of the novel. Like, the guy couldn't have simply stayed away and let his insurance pay for her care, if he did love her that much.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there is not much in the way of characterization in this book. You don't know much about Christine, and nothing about Ben, Adam, or Claire, except that they were sweet and lovely and loved her. Yep, that tells me lots. We basically never see them at all.<br /><br />Maybe the movie I've heard is upcoming will flesh them out, and be one of those rare films that is better than the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've heard a lot about this game from my friends and wanted to play.  The game has not disappointed me.  A lot of fun.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Its a good player and recommended. I hope it will play all formats available, and hope to have customization on video such brightness, color, etc or probably have scene themes such cool, warm videos, etc. and lastly will read subs of the video or movie.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I couldn't find my old copy so i ordered another one. What a great album. &#34;Long Live My Chemical Romance!&#34;
B00BO4GTG0|3.0|the flowers in this book are fun, or stunning, or whimsical or gorgeous, and sometimes all of these. the problem is finding crepe paper to actually DO the projects. i spent several hours last night checking the resources provided, only to find that not one of them has more than a few of the appropriate papers. be prepared to spend lots of time tracking down the papers, and paying many different shipping charges. i never did find some of the crepe. the author uses specific names for many of the crepe colors, and i am at a loss to find them. the kite paper (glassine) in pretty colors seems to be a real rarity. i really want to make some of these. if anyone has a suggestion, i would love to hear it.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Love this album! I'm late on writing this review but it came quickly! I'm so sad about my chemical romance breaking up it feels just like yesterday :(
B009WUBERW|5.0|Good picture quality, great move with all the hero stars. Thanks amazon ...if you are not a prime member you ought to be one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is excellent. Easy read, beautifully written and very real that you can almost relate and feel the characters in the story.<br />I just hoped for a happier ending but then again that will not be a &#34;real&#34; story, it would be a movie or a fairy tale. It's what I would like to call a &#34;thinking&#34; book where you feel the need to analyze the motives and actions of the characters against yourself. I enjoyed reading it till the end. I want to know more of how the characters moved on with their lives, with the closure they didn't really have. I just wonder.<br />I loved it! Loved the reality of it! Thank you Liane!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|She killed the heroine.... She fought too hard for her to kill her off. If this is going to be the outcome of the movies then I am not going to watch them.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was so filled with drama I couldn't put this book down. I liked it better than the first book.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Enjoy the fact that all this movies are at my finguer tips. :-).  I like that I can view this movies any where I go.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Thanks for delivering my item on time. Movie plays good and was exactly as described by you guys. I hope to do business again with u guys soon and thanks once again for a job well done. Please continue to keep up the good work you guys are doing and hope to see you guys soon on amazon.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|My student is required to read several texts for the academic year and with adobe reader it is useful to utilize with Amazon Kindle.
B00ESB75FA|3.0|This episode is from &#34;How I Met Your Mother&#34;'s final season, and as such should appeal to committed fans of the show.  The parts in which the minister appears are among the highlights.  Those who are not regular viewers of the show may have trouble following the plot and may be offended by the show's often smutty attempts at humor.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Really Good, very challenging. Must get this app, I am very picky but I highly recommend this app. This is actually very hard, I have not gotten past level seven. I need a hand. The good part is unlimited hint and little ads everywhere!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it is fun and challenging - it's different and fast paced - I am not good at it yet but I will be soon :)
B003G4W49C|4.0|I have been a fan of fantasy and sci-fi for many years.  This book has long been on the periphery of my chosen series, but never read.  An interview with Mr. Card drew me to give it a shot, and I am extremely pleased that I have done so.  While the ending of the book was somewhat apparent, the execution of the story was nothing less than amazing.  The emotional roller coaster the book puts the reader through is not to be missed.  I will consider this one of the better books I have read, and it will end up in a rotation of &#34;to be read again&#34; stories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such an addicting game. I'm so glad it's finally on Kindle!!! I do think the lives should update alot sooner. 30 minutes is a long time to wait:)
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|When i heard the samples i was disappointed because of the autotune on some songs.<br /><br />BUT when i heard the whole album i loved it, i have listened to it countless times since!<br /><br />Cher has created a very modern, very Cher album with this, it has dance songs, amazing ballads!At the age of 67 she still has an AMAZING voice!<br />Would it be better without autotune? Of course, her voice does not need it!<br /><br />Fell in love with Lovers Forever,it's such an amazing song, co-written by Cher, originally a ballad, here a fast paced dance song, would be an excellent single, when Cher sings \\"surrender to me now\\" i immediately did!<br /><br />Love all the songs ... just to name some Dressed To Kill is fun, My Love is beautiful, Sirens is haunting, I Hope You Find it , Lie To Me, Will You Wait for Me are gorgeous ballads, Walk Alone is a great song written by Pink and Pride is also a favourite.<br />Basically the whole cd flows nicely together, worth to buy the deluxe edition, i have taken out the 2 unneccessary Woman's World remix ( songs 15, 16 ) and the rest of the 15 songs make a perfect album.<br /><br />Cher has an amazing body of work starting from the late 60's. In 50 years she have made many excellent albums in many different styles, movies, tv shows, concerts, have appeared in a theatre play, won many awards from Grammy to Oscar and through out all this she have stayed the same lovely fun personality!<br />I was lucky enough to meet her in person recently and she is really lovely and down to earth, she has really done a good job with this Closer To The Truth release!<br />Next year a new tour which is exciting and a bit sad at the same time, might be her last, but we can all hope not!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|i love it, I like it very much, I love the story very much especially that they present it with different way than any other producer present that story before
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't help but fall madly in love with Christian Grey! His transformation from Ana' s love is utterly beautiful!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|awesome ! great fun for all ages! challenges the mind in every way! what a great find! cant wait to move on to more rooms and harder puzzles!  I give it 5 out of 5 stars!!!! ENJOY!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pros:<br />Great dpi<br />Adjustable weight to  fit your preference<br />Good size<br />Great button placement - the side buttons are easily accessible but not intrusive<br />Easy to use software<br />Price<br /><br />Cons:<br />Side buttons don't have a solid feel - time will tell if they last<br /><br />Coming from using a Razer Naga, the Anker mouse is a great alternative.  After my naga broke for the 3rd time, it is no longer covered by their warranty, and I was left to find an alternative.  I took a gamble on this brand I had never heard of, and have been more than pleased so far.<br /><br />Time will tell if the buttons hold up, but I'm impressed with the quality of this mouse.  It sacrifices very little to become a great budget gaming mouse.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|At first it was working perfectly, but then it crashed and never worked again. I deleted it and downloaded it, but it still crashed. Waste of time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you for such a great app. Well worth my time to utilize! I can't believe this is free! It will even read the bible to me in my preferred translation. Nice!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so elated that Amazon finally allows us to play candy crush!!! Now we need pet rescue. This game is like my escape from the outside word. It keeps you wanting to get to the next level
B007EC27QM|4.0|Tried a few, and no percent or square key, then found this one. Finally one that works like it suppose to. I would recommend this app.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Very smart writing! You could feel the emotions of the characters. It had several twists and turns. Just when you thought that you had the story all figured out the plot would take a twisted turn that you did not expect.<br /><br />When it ended, I wanted more.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I really like this when I am out of town and at motels, cuz it helps create a soothing sound and makes it easier to sleep. I don't even hear the traffic. I really like this app and I would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Scary but cool I think this is an easy read although pretty scary if you like scary books read this!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two book in this series and was waiting impatiently for this to come out.  I came away feeling that the the plot was overly simple, the way Four \\"fixed\\" things a joke, and the loss of a certain character pointless.  Way too angsty, feels like it was written by another author all together.
B00004RF9B|5.0|When a space craft and it's crew are sent to relieve a scientist sent to a far away planet, they are turned away. But Leslie Nielsen will not go away.He is the Captain. Not very long after arriving the Crew of the ship start to be killed by an invisible being. You won't believe what it is. Robbie the robot debuts here as well. Just an all around Good movie but don't expect a rock em sock em robot flick.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|By far the most rewarding card game to play on the kindle. Real Time magic the gathering type battles with people? Yes please.
B000000OU0|5.0|A fantastic concert. Eagles classic songs and a few new ones as well. The best part is the politically incorrect song to me &#34;Get Over It&#34; a gotta have for Eagles Fans
B00FCR3JQS|4.0|If you reading this review probably you know about HONY.<br />If you don't follow the facebook page and the blog.<br /><br />I am dissapointed with the Kindle edition. It ws my first kindle ebook purchase and the quality isn't there,<br />Also the pre-order price was around $17 and now it is $12.99<br /><br />Get the printed version. The kindle edition isn't worth.
B002KH4KSY|3.0|Not one of the Best remakes, but if you have the rest it is almost a must have. You feel sorry for the Hero as his wife is kind of annoying. When the children of the corn find her...well you guessed it, The Hero doesn't come out on top, but you root for him all the way through the movie. So not the worst remake.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, lots of fun and makes me laugh all the time.  Very addicting.  Graphics are amazing and I love the Halloween theme in residential.
6300181286|5.0|A Fantastic Classic for the Ages. Karlof at his best!!! A Must Have!!! If you are going to try and build a human then you have to be a madman!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|WOW. This book was a slow starter. It ended about the only way it could. Hot and erotic or just old fashioned torture?
B000FA57US|5.0|Michael Myers finds out he has a niece and goes on a rampage again looking for her. Just when you think she will survive the horror, she turns out to be a true killer herself and later on stars in in Rob Zombie's re-make as well. A must have for Halloween buffs!!!
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I was told by a friend that there was not a good movie because there was not enough action. Well if you expect the same from a particular actor/actress through their whole career, that might be true.  The movie was more \\" cerebral\\" than most Will Smith movies , which was find to me.  I recognized the concepts brought out in the movie.  Some things that many persons are not interested in, unless you are drawn to that type of thing. I can also see the difficulty actors may have in getting into different types of roles that a lot of their fans don't care for. I loved the movie. I like lots of action also , but I'm not addicted to it.  Peace!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|The game downloaded OK, but wouldn't install on my Kindle Fire. I cleared space for it, sent almost everything to the cloud, but it still wouldn't install. I guess I got what I paid for. Nothing!
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|Just enough bluegrass arranged in a country style.  This album is just what Alan Jackson needed to continue strong in the business.  I was never sure why he or many other country artists hadn't done an album like this when it would surely sound great.  I'm glad he did.
B008220AVW|5.0|I kind of wish I didn't see this.  Before I did I was completely indifferent to Katy Perry.  I didn't like her or hate her.  I just didn't care either way.  Then one day I sat down and watched this after hearing some rave reviews about it from critics and I fell in love with her.  After watching this I discovered things about this Katy Perry character I didn't know anything about.  She was likable and nice.  There wasn't a diva bone in her body.  I sort of equate female pop stars to being a little full of themselves as if they're curing cancer or something.  I realized that Katy Perry is a hardworking girl who loves to entertain, sing and play the guitar.  There was some poignant moving moments in this as she allows the cameras to continue filming even when she's visibly heartbroken over the problems with her relationship at the time with Russell Brand.  I also didn't know that she writes her own lyrics and that they are from her personal experiences.  That made me like her even more that she allows herself to be cracked open in her work.  I learned that she didn't have it all handed to her and had to fight to create a career.  Sure this is a little cotton candy and bubble gum-ish, but its done so well that you find yourself being uplifted.  I'm embarrassed to say that I loved this and became a fan of Katy Perry by the end of this.  But hey if she can be that cracked open in her lyrics, I think I can be just as cracked open to admit that I like Katy Perry!  Ended up buying this DVD after watching it and of course then ended up buying two of her CD's since I didn't own anything Katy Perry related.  \\"Teenage Dream\\" and \\"Prism\\".  It's a good thing she made this movie, otherwise I probably never would've given her a chance.  I'm not particularly a big pop music fan, but it seems like she's one of the better ones out there.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is an excellent tool for a student. It is clearly formatted and provides all the elements for a word.
B002QS1O36|4.0|Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler gave a powerful performance as Christine Daae and the Phantom. Rossum's voice showed an extraordinary amount of color and flexibility for a teenager. Butler's voice sometimes maxed out on top, but his performance of Music of the Night was completely seductive. I could have done without Raoul's mullet, but his duet with Rossum was sublime. I love the effect when Christine puts the Phantom's ring on before offering herself to him to save Raoul's life. In the play he forcibly puts in on her finger as he proposes to her in front of the audience. My one complaint is I wish I could put it on a DVD so I can watch it on my TV with a bigger screen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's ok. I mean it's really good for little kids and 10 year olds. Not the best for older kids although. It gets really boring after awhile because you have to like check on them every five minutes to keep their health up. And the fact that feed you have to spend like all of your coins to boost their health tbe most (which might I add that the highest is 20) I really like the app it just is better for little kids.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I especially appreciate this app's ability to display on my Kindle Fire those items I've saved from my desktop or laptop computer.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love the Angry Bird games to begin with, but the addition of the Star Wars themed characters and abilities has made the game interesting.
B004V9MU86|5.0|The descriptions in this book catch you off guard with their rarity and clarity. Just breathtaking. The characters were in my heart before I knew it and now at the ending I have tears on my cheeks. An astounding book, original and insightful. Worth every second.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this app!! its so cute when om nom is sleeping!!!! I rate this app 5 stars and if you like cut the rope you will love this!!!!!!
B001V7YJMG|5.0|This is an awesome movie unlike others of this genre. Creepy, suspenseful but well-thought out with a good cast. Definitely worth watching!
B00G32VYDG|3.0|It's a dumb blow'em-up movie that gets right to the point. At 97 minutes, this movie doesn't try to waste your time with extra side stories or alternate main plots. It also doesn't have any subtlety or nuance, even for an fx-laden action film.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Good show, DVD good quality. Child hood has been redeemed.<br />Would recommend. Also a lot cheaper that at stores. yup
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|And continued to think about the story after I finished.<br /><br />Waiting for the next book in this series to come out.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Nice little sharpener.<br />Ceramic and carbide sharpening options.<br />Even a diamond spindle for grooves.<br />Really nice price too.<br />Get one
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|It is a really cool app so you can see what you sound like recommend it to all ages<br />Love love love
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Not the movie of the year, but fun and exceeded expectations!  Entertaining and overacted, Rest In Peace Dept. was definitely worth the rent...Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds didn't break new ground as two undead cops searching our world for the &#34;Walking dead,&#34; but it worked!  Not quite Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith but chemistry was there.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Am so happy to see this game on Kindle. This game takes my mind off problems. It is so relaxing and help you use your brain. Very excellent game.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|Fun game and challenging.  Don't have much time to play, but I was having a fun time when I did.
B000LZ53N8|5.0|Great album and I love the bonus track, Glorious.  This is the version to get, even if it is way more than other CD/DVD combos.  The bonus dvd is great as well.

B00915G6MG|1.0|DVDs 3 and 4 are missing instead I can open a shop with DVDs one and two.  Well one could give it back but that's quite a pain if you are living in Europe....<br /><br />I hope this time I'll get at least one box with the missing DVDs....
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I don't normally do reviews for games but this one is great!<br /><br /> So relaxing and so cool how it's like playing a galaxy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|no spoilers :)<br />THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT BOOK!<br />I have to wait about a week before I can get mockingjay.<br />I just can't wait!! I LOVE JENNIFER LAWRENCE &lt;3 she's a true role model. Can't wait for the movie!!!!!!!
B004ZH66XO|3.0|its a fun game for boring moments and will give you hours of fun in that case. but i deleted it after 2 weeks due to the fact that for me it did not hold my interest and i never got use to the controls
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another Grisham winner! One part education. One part thriller. One part mystery. One part nail biter. This novel was a page-turner from the first page.
B00F91H15W|4.0|The actors did such a great job of showing the emotions of the real teens throughout the movie! Just fantastic!
B004ETVAH0|5.0|This music video is one of the best I have ever seen! The music and singing is so in sync that it blows your mind! Have had several friends over to watch it and have literally made a night of it. It actually makes you want to get up and applaud. Imelda May is a super singer and can pull this off without a hitch. Only wish I would have been at the event live.  Would have been fabulous!!!!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I miss the happy falling in love days of season 1, but that is just me.  I had to look up the spoiler info on this season and intentionally missed watching episode 5. It was a great episode I was told, but too sad for me. It would have ruined my whole week!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Definitely will recommend. Story is exciting and sexual. Characters are interesting. I look forward to the next stories to see what becomes of their relationship
B0013G2VBQ|5.0|Its Layne Staley at his best....and the band is on fire on every track.... very deep material. An albumn I never get tired of.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Please fix this poorly thought out book.  Read these awesome reviews because most are spot on.  Make the movie better than this book!  It shouldn't be too difficult.<br /><br />I wanted to really be blown away by this book, like I was with Divergent.  Unfortunately it's just been a downward spiral of disappointment.  Read at your own risk folks!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I used to watch Netflix using my desktop pc that is connected to my 60&#34; television screen, but my desktop runs a little loud sometimes so that always bothered me.  You can't even hear chromecast so now I just use this and turn the desktop off.  It is awesome!<br /><br />Looking forward for future apps that will hopefully come out for this like Amazon Prime, fingers crossed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I had very high expectations for Allegiant. The first two books had perfect flow, interesting concepts, and a constant state of suspense along with believable characters. This one, not so much...<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Questions are finally answered about the Divergent, the world outside of the fence, the factions, and other previous events.<br /><br />2. The IDEA of having split chapter points of view between Tris and Tobias was a good one, though the execution was lacking.<br /><br />3. There were some places where the writing reminded me why I loved this series in the first place.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1: The writing. Even though some places had the same engrossing writing, I was disappointed with most of it. There were many entire chapters that were boring and unnecessary and I found myself forcing myself to push through it. The perfect pacing from the earlier books is all but non-existent. Instead, either everything's going on at once or nothing is with no happy medium. A series that used to be beautiful in its uniqueness fell into clichés that distracted from the writing.  When I read it I honestly thought it was a manuscript rather than a final, edited draft.<br /><br />2: There was next to no difference between the voices of Tris and Tobias. When I heard we were going to get chapters from both voices, I was very happy with the decision. However, what could have been a good tool just turned out confusing. I often had to look back at the chapter headings just to know who it was speaking. Characters are all individual people with individual personalities, so them having the same voice just doesn't make sense, even if this is really difficult to do.<br /><br />3: Inconsistencies of character-a lot of them.  Tobias becomes whiny and emotional and loses his grip on logic way too many times, differing from his steady, calm persona established in the earlier books. Tris also makes some decisions that are completely put of character. Peter, who got some amazing characterization in Insurgent, is ignored and then he's completely different. Other major gaps are seen in Marcus, Evelyn, Johanna, and Uriah. One major character only had two lines.<br /><br />4. New characters I didn't care about. They didn't receive that much characterization and I really didn't care about their fates. They weren't real enough for me to relate to them.<br /><br />5. Lack of a good antagonist. Jeanine in the first two books was the perfect villain. She was cold, intelligent, robotic, and capable of doing horrible things with no remorse. In Allegiant, both main antagonists weren't properly fleshed out. I hated them, but I didn't LOVE to hate them.<br /><br />6. The ending. I'm okay with unhappy endings. In fact, if there was a &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending, I would be just as angry. But no matter how depressing the ending is a sense of hope still has to be there, otherwise the reader feels cheated. Instead of feeling hopeful at the end of this book, I ended up feeling discouraged both by the &#34;main event&#34; of the climax and the purpose for it. Without giving away what happens, it left me feeling confused as to what the message was. I felt that while it was bold, Veronica Roth's decision was completely unnecessary and, to be quite frank, a wrong one. While it hit me emotionally, it left me feeling angry, with no closure.<br /><br />Overall, there are many reasons for why this book leaves me feeling unsatisfied, disappointed, and most of all bewildered. No matter how much I admire how courageous the author was, I was left feeling like the whole journey had been worthless. Even rereading the first two books won't be the same knowing what happens, and unfortunately I probably won't, even though they were two of my favorites. After months of waiting, I wish that I hadn't read it at all. Anything I could imagine would be better than the unfortunate train-wreck this turned out to be.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Just got this headset and it works amazing for a wireless headset.<br />The sound quality is pretty good.  It isn't amazing or anything, but everything sounds clear and the \\"7.1 surround sound emulation\\" is pretty decent.<br /><br />The battery life is great and the range is also fantastic.  I can walk all around my house with these on and the sound quality is as if I was sitting next to my desktop.<br /><br />The only bad thing is sometimes, even if I am sitting in front of my desktop, the headphones will lose sound for 1.5-2 seconds.  Out of 4 hours this might happen once and sometimes twice.  This isn't a big deal for me since it is kind of expected for it being wireless, but that is the only delay I ever get and again, it rarely happens.<br /><br />Also works fine for windows 8.1, just download the newest drivers at [...]<br /><br />I use this with Mumble and it has worked fine with any online game I have tried.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|i never get bored with this series and have found it entertaining from start to finish,i cant wait for season nine
B008JFUNKU|5.0|This movie was suspicious and intense since it started. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It is one order the best movies I have seen in a while but let me tell you that I wouldn't want to see it again for a while. The friend who went with us said it her anxiety, I loved it but I have to not  see it every day
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I liked this game at first but I have been stuck on one level for weeks. It really takes the fun out of it when it is impossible to move on.
B00G32TD98|5.0|My husband, 13 year old daughter, and I rented this on Amazon Prime. We had planned on seeing it in the theater but didn't get a chance to do that. We were all jumping and  screeching and pointing things out that were happening. Granted, my husband was screeching less than we girls, but still. It had a good plot. It didn't feel disjointed. It wasn't majorly gory. It had awesome tension. Anyone who really likes scary movies with atmospheric tension should love it. Similar to Insidious and to a lesser degree, Paranormal Activity. If you are looking for a movie with tons of gore though, this might not be for you. All in all, we really loved it and plan on buying it on Blu ray later. :D
8866130915|5.0|For the past three years, I have been using the Moleskin Weekly Notebook Diary/Planners, which are fantastic. They're solidly constructed, with smooth, non-smearing paper, and are designed such that the left pages are dedicated to the weekly planner, while the right page is dedicated to notes. There's also an additional notes section in the back of the planner and references pages at the beginning (including international holidays, travel planning, monthly calendars, etc.).<br /><br />I love using these not only to keep track of what's coming up, but as a record of what I've done in the past. Highly recommend!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I just wish some of the stuff in this movie could be translated to real life. I wants me an invincible flying suit real bad.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Great movie. Wasn't as good as number one and number 2 but still it was a good show to watch.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Good touching book. More realistic views on living and dying . Wish it didn't make me cry though. Read it
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is my hero she is not only the funniest person, but she is.also kind genneres and enthusiastic. When I read this awesome book; I felt that. Seriously ...I'm kidding is my favorite book.
B0035LMTZA|1.0|Very poor video quality didn't even watch the movie cuz it was just piss poor video quality, don't understand why anybody would watch a movie with that video quality.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|You should totally get more of these book but so far this is my very very favorite. THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|My 6 year old grandson is completely entranced by it. The graphics and audio are very good and he has figured it out very quickly so it appears to be pretty intuitive in its play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive I play on my home computer,phone and on my kindle fire love the interaction with others on Facebook!! I highly recommend it!!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|First, the build quality is nothing but excellent and the folding design is extremely convenient. Ear cushions are very comfortable and fit perfectly. Sound isolation is very good also. Head band is padded just right. (I imagine some may want more padding but it does not cause discomfort.)<br /><br />Second, sound quality is amazing right of the box.<br />I tried many premium headphones in stores but I do not think I would trade mine for any of those.<br /><br />One thing that took me a bit by surprise was the coiled cord.<br />At first, it looked somewhat large for personal use.<br />But I like it now as it allows me to walk away from my computer (or even walk in a room) not taking off headphones.<br />I also cannot get tangled in it as I did with a 10' straight cable on my other headphones.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book is impressively well written, and the author appears to have thought of everything. Before starting I had no idea the layout requirements would be so different from \\"normal\\" word processing, but it seems that every contingency has been covered.<br />Although I have not yet taken the final step of uploading my book to KDP, I feel confident that I will manage it without difficulty and am grateful.
B00E03ULJS|5.0|I thought this album was going to be OK since it was a lot of hype for Krewella. At first when I listen to the album, it was OK. After listening it a couple of times, it grew on me.
B0007LGCB8|5.0|Quality and performance is best in class.  You could probably get something similar within the same price range, but it would not last as long.  I have been through two disappointments with two other leading brands.  My previous KEEN sandals outlasted them  both, even as I put them through much more abuse.  I am happily back to KEEN - it has been several months and quality is as good as always.<br /><br />I got 1 size bigger, to have it fit very comfortably without being too big.  I got a different KEEN sandal which is true size for me (1 size smaller!) and if fits perfectly.  At least, Buy a half a size bigger in this model.  I wish they would be more consistent sizing their different models.  Go to their website - they have guidelines around this for most models.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|The book is great.I love it.I think that the author did a great job on the book.<br />I think that other people should read the book to. Its officialy the best book EVER!!!!!!!!!! I love jeff kiney because she is a really great writer. Shes funny and she writes really good books.  :-D
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Does not connect, have tried it with two routers,tablet and laptop, waste of money. I use my Roku,with no problem
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant is the first book I've ever cried over. I am devastated that Tris died and also very sad for Tobias too. I so thought that they would make a new life after that final fight but no she dies but it was a good death. I have no idea what I'm going to do now since I finished this series! But I know that this series will live with me forever. So those who read this, be brave reading this book.
006202406X|1.0|Where do I even start?<br /><br />First of all, I have to state that I was really looking forward to this book because the first two were so good, for YA fiction. Granted, the writing wasn't Pulitzer Prize-worthy, but the characters were well developed and the plot lines seemed to flow toward some congruent point. The way that Insurgent ended, with the big cliff hanger of Edit Prior's video, made me believe that the story was going to progress down a path that would lead the characters to answers about their past and the future of their city. However, Allegiant started off slow, took too many confusing (and dead end) turns and then had such a shocking, hearbreaking end, I felt like I was reading someone else's interpretation of Veronica Roth's work.<br /><br />Just a few of the things I didn't like:<br />The dual POV. I was actually excited when I found out that this book would be written from both Tris and Tobias' POV. Because I had read Free Four and The Transfer, both written from Tobias' POV, I felt like I already had some insight to how he thought. But the voice of his character in Allegiant was nothing like the previous stories. Nor did it seem to jive with the behavior of his character from the first two books. Also, even though we were able to see his POV in this book, some of the actions he took in this book were out of character for him and had no explanation.<br /><br />Tris' lack of continued character development. In Allegiant, we finally find out what being Divergent really means and that Tris is basically a &#34;genetically cured&#34; human, But there is no explanation as to why she is an anomaly even among GP's. For example, why is it that she can resist the &#34;death serum&#34;? And while on the subject of &#34;death serum&#34; (and serums in general): this concept was so ridiculous that I couldn't take it seriously. Why would they need to develop a serum for death? Wouldn't a hypodermic needle full of bleach serve the same purpose? I don't know anyone, GP or not, who could resist the effects of that pumping through their veins. Also, she spends most of her time at the compound trying to find out about her mother and is basically oblivious to the fact that Tobias is struggling with the truth of his identity and their existence. She makes little attempt to comfort him or assure him that she still cares for him.<br /><br />The visits to &#34;The Fringe&#34; by both Tris and Tobias appeared to serve no purpose to further the story, maybe other than to show the divide between how the GP's and the GD's lived. But the only example the characters were able to observe of GP lifestyle was at the Bureau compound so how could they adequately judge whether that divide was the same everywhere. They just took it at face value and never really questioned it.<br /><br />The name of the book, Allegiant, really had nothing to do with the rest of the story. The only glimpse we got of the Allegiant movement within the city was through the cameras in the Bureau compound. Also, their cause was they were loyal to the Faction system, which ended up being disbanded anyway. Another dead end plot line.<br /><br />Lastly, obviously I'm not alone when I say that Tris' death was a huge shock. I really didn't see that coming and I'm not really sure why the author felt the need to kill her off. I didn't get the sense that her death was all that self-less or necessary. Plus, to be perfectly honest, I was hoping for a happy ending for Tris and Tobias. Not really for Tris' sake but I felt that, after all he'd been through in his life and considering how much he lover her,  Tobias really deserved a happy ending.<br /><br />I'm going to forget that I read this book and hold out for the hope that if they end up making all 3 movies from this trilogy, that they fix the ending.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|So,I downloaded this on my dad's original kindle fire.It was a great choice!But,soon afterwards,we ran into charging problems with the fire,so we picked up the gen 2.It ran even better!It crashed 2 times on maps,but the free price gives it 5 stars.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Can't stop reading!!! Tyrion is my fav character! It's a book where you will love and hate the same character more than once because you don't know what's coming next!!
B002JODPSO|5.0|great scenes, good humour Bruce Willis and his unwilling sidekick worked great together. the action was pretty good, a bit out there maybe, but what the hell
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Kept me going same as the first! The characters are easily liked and hated? I will finish the books prior to season 4 comes back on!
B001P36OY2|3.0|I chose this rating cause it claimed uncut? this is a very good movie, but certain scenes were not in it and i was a bit dissapointed, at such. please do not state a movie is extended when it is actually missing shots.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Amazon finally fixed the glitch(es) in this game so I can sync w/laptop & phone.  I've waited and complained about this for quite awhile & glad someone was listening.
B0047SF41G|4.0|I really liked this movie.  A nice verity of characters and I really like the theme of the humans choosing if they are hunters or prey.  Alot of great one-liners as well.  There were some plot devices that didn't work but over all it was a really good movie.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|My 8yr old son loves Legos and Mindcraft so this birthday girt was perfect. He LOVES them and I will be getting the other sets to go along with The Village. Legos are on the more expensive side but always worth it. Educational and last forever, so I will keep them coming! Amazon did great with delivering earlier than expected also!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Some of the levels take quite a few times to pass.  I really like the game just wish you could earn more coins and gems.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY. I'm excited now I can pay it on my Kindle it's about time lol. All in all its a great game addictive but great.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Youtube and netflix streaming is awesome. but they must provid support for other application also. sometimes  it doesn't detect by laptop. still there are lots of issue with the device. you need to have patience while using it. but its value for money if its working fine. looks like google guys need to do lot more testing before launching the product in the market.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so much fun! You can design people's hair and even take pictures of  the finished hair do and send it to your friends. This game is AWESOME and I recommend it to anyone!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book. I mean, who gets married overnight, I was expecting to find it unrealistic. But have to say - it was great. I couldn't put it down. The characters were believable, and easily identified with. The love story behind it was lovely and of course with a happy ending. Bit predictable of course, but a good read and some laugh out loud moments as well.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Joss Whedon gathered a crew of actors with whom he had worked previously, and they joined to make a movie of Shakespeare's<br />&#34;Much Ado About Nothing,&#34; at Whedon's house.  The words are Shakespeare's, but the setting is contemporary--in Whedon's home.  This is not an informal stab at Shakespeare: the actors and are outstanding, the performance true to the play.  Extremely well done.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Works just like desktop version and I don't need to play on my phone anymore. So happy this is finally available!!!!!!!
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|A beautiful print of &#34;Sunset Boulevard,&#34; enhanced by Blu-Ray.  The commentary on the movie was outstanding and helped put the movie in historical context.  The commentary also included stories about Billy Wilder's role in the movie as well as the significance of Gloria Swanson's effect on the film.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I am really enjoying this game, and will no doubt buy the next installment. I am a bit disappointed that the game didn't go any further, but I did like figuring out the puzzle. It is fantastic brain stimulation! There were also a couple of spots that I got stuck on, as the clues provided didn't lead me in the right direction right away, so I had to stop playing for a day or so to let my brain rest before I could properly utilize the clues and make progress in the game. Overall, it was very fun, and I loved making new discoveries in the game, but I wish the clues weren't so cryptic at points.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies for little girls. I love that this sweet little girl (Sara) never gives up and always retains that hope that her father will return for her. She recalls the special message that he taught her, that she is a princess (even if just his princess). Although she is abandoned to the care of a less than generous schoolmaster who treats little Sara as the lowliest of servants, Sara maintains her principles and treats others with unconditional love. One of my favorite scenes is when she and her friend (other little servant girl) wake up to a beautiful dream compliments of their generous neighbor benefactor. Alfonso Cuaron, who also directed a couple of the Harry Potter films, is a creative genius and did well with this one. Worth the time to watch.
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|Sophomoric drivel--  not  up to  the quality of Blink or Outliers.  Gladwell assumes adversity and mismatch equate with virtue and triumph. He does not present a convincing case . The opposite outcomes are just as plausible.
B00AXVHHTI|4.0|I'm a student in grad school and it's hard to find free time for movies but several of my classmates (gals and guys) talked about this series so I decided to sit down and use my Amazon Prime membership for something besides the 2-day free shipping! I started with Season 1 of Downton Abbey and loved it! I can see why people talk about being hooked. I finally finished the final episode of Season 3 (watched all 3 seasons in the last 3 weeks-sacrificing my sleep but not my $$ education). Spoiler Alert: I was disappointed with the end of the season... I think Tom needs his ally (more than ever) and I'll be sad to see Matthew go but I'm happy to see that Mary survived the birth of their son. Looking forward to Season 4.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love love love LOVE the ending best book series I have ever read filled with action suspense and could not stop reading
B004ADB17Y|5.0|One of my favorite movies for children. Full of adventure, true friendship and camaraderie, first love, and sticking up for the underdog (in this case, sticking up for the \\"Goonies\\"), this is a true classic for children of all ages.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very fun game. A definite must have.<br /><br />It's like temple run for kids, but with better graphics and more character choices. You always have the opportunity to get new players and upgrades. And you get to see a lot of places from New York to Italy to Tokyo. Also you can earn extra upgrades with mini challenges.<br /><br />I can share this with my niece and nephew and not worry about losing my progress for a new update. The more you play, the more you earn. If you want something specific, you can save up to get it without having to actually spend money. You can purchase with real money for characters or certain upgrades, but usually not necessary.<br /><br />It's great to share with friends online or through mobile devices.<br /><br />The only thing that has me giving it 4 instead of 5 stars at present is the latest update. It has resulted in causing the game to glitch while you play. This usually makes the player trip and get caught more frequently. Hopefully this technical error is fixed and you get to enjoy the game as I've had for the last year.<br /><br />My only other disappointment is that you can't move between locations. Like go to New York from Miami. You do travel with each update. But sometimes I want to go back to a previous location setting.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I thought, overall, this was a pretty good series. the final book had plenty of action and resolution. The world the series is set in is very interesting and fantastical though perhaps a bit unrealistic at times, however that isn't necessarily a bad thing to me. it's definitely aimed towards young adults but I don't think that takes away from the story, plot, or characters. the final book, Allegiant, was my favorite of the series. a good read all around.
B00DG86ARK|4.0|Exceptional visual and audio quality. Breathtaking performance. Highly recommended. Only reason it's not 5 stars is that the bluray is only a stereo audio mix.  A 5.1 mix would only improve an already outstanding performance.  Must have.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Good movie but only was able to hear half of the sound. The comedy was the best part of the semi action movie.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I'm sure there are a ton of reviews saying this same thing but, I got this for my girlfriend and was surprised by how great of a concert it was. She is an amazing singer and its not my kind of music really but I've gladly watched it more than a couple times.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|The movie at be fine but Amazons delivery is not very good. Either the movies don't play or the sound is off. Not sure why the service is so poor.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|This is great.  It gives you lots of options to play and it gives you enough points to continue playing.  Lots of fun.
B00003CWPL|1.0|Just DO NOT WATCH IT. This movie needs NEGATIVE STARS to be properly rated. Okay, are you masochistic? Love to make yourself suffer? This movie is so horrible it should be banned as torture. Oh, are you &#34;sophisticated&#34; and pride yourself on having a higher sense of artistic appreciation than others? Yes, watch it, you stuck-up, jaded, dead-souled thing, and write glowing reviews about the masterful use of dark and light, surrealism, etc. But none of these positive reviews fool me -- NOBODY could watch this film even once -- not even partly through -- and actually enjoy it unless there was something very wrong with their head and even deeper in their psyche. The only reason there's so many positive reviews is that nobody in their right mind (truly right mind) would think of watching it if they had heard much about it, and wouldn't watch much of it if they didn't know what they were getting into and started watching it. Take it from me: I gave in to a dark impulse of morbid curiosity and now wish someone had warned me. I have a taste for the weird, bizarre, even avant garde, at least when I'm in the mood, but this monstrosity isn't so much strange and bizarre as it is willfully designed to create a constant strain and irritation of the mind!  It is unrelenting, there is no island of sanity, no glimmer of hope or happiness, not a moment when it doesn't grate like chalk, fingernails, claws on a blackboard accompanied by a can opener grinding on a mispositioned can. Maybe it should be watched by the people who say there is no sign of God in this world, or if there is one, he's evil -- because THIS shows what that sort of world would be like; there's no good in this world, and its creator obviously was evil. It might also be good for those contemplating having sex with someone they are not married to -- obviously nobody is really going to have a baby with a head that looks like a cross between a giant sperm and a lamb's that was skinned alive, but the imagery is so stark and merciless it will certainly cause a loss of appetite for sexual relations (or food, maybe living...)
0199235694|3.0|This book is short and right to the point, and is so tiny that you barely feel the weight when carrying it to class.  The bad thing is that the ideas are very generalized because it's so short so there is some more research involved if you want to find out more key details about Japanese history.
0345803507|5.0|Couldn't put these books down.  I enjoyed them a lot and have shared them with others as well.  Look forward to reading them again one day!

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|So much more than we expected. My husband is so happy to hear some oldies he had forgotten, as well as clever remakes of familiar ones to me. Good Sale quality of disc and all!  Jan Robinson
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The ending of the book ruins the whole series for me.  I think the author was trying so hard to make this another Hunger Games that she felt she needed a big shock value, but this was the wrong choice in my opinion.  It just makes the whole thing pointless.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Luv this game!!!! It's keeps me busy and entertained. A must have.  Great for all ages, it keeps meds busy and adults entertained. Can get to the point you don't want to put it down.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Just another great book by Mr. David ,don't ever quite selling his books.and I well always have something to read.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|Great family movie! Fun for all of us. If you're looking for a family movie to watch for Halloween this is it. I watched when I was younger and loved it then and two decades later love it still. My husband, kids, and I all really enjoyed it.  It's a great story with a great ending.  It will be our new Halloween tradition.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Absolutely great book.  Lost much sleep staying awake with the characters in this book. They became like friends and family over time  Just cannot wait for the third book in the trilogy.  Thank you so much Ken.
B00COCY67A|5.0|This is MUSIC. This is another part of REAL ELVIS QUALITY. The sound, lineer notes, photos, songs themselves, Elvis' humor between the reherseals; Everything is really entertaining. This is a real music for new fans, old fans of Elvis; also just music lovers. Different types of songs, R&B, pop, ballad, everything's here to entertain you by the biggest popular icon ever. Elvis is timeless and this is another reason why a 31 years old(born after 4 years of his death) young guy from Istanbul TR loves his music sooo much.Elvis deserves the respect and quality care; so is this alb&uuml;m. BUY IT !!!
B0000C23DO|5.0|I love this collection!  Includes 17 of the all time best covering virtually the entire Grateful Dead trip.  If you were around in the 60s, 70s, and even the 80s, this album cannot help but bring back nostalgic memories.  Remastering and sound is great.  What a fun ride!!!
B0096PS5Q6|5.0|Elvis is timeless. So is this concert series.It may not be the BEST concert of his but a great concert with well choosen song list by the biggest entertainer of all time. The reherseal concert sound treat is another winner and makes this limited edition vinyl a rare collection piece. The lineer notes with really good pictures give you full details about this concert event. Great quality indeed.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Long anticipated and long over-due.  This is a truly memorable concert and perhaps one of the really great Dead performances of all time.  Considering the age, setting, and circumstances, the re-mastering is remarkable.  This concert was worth the wait and has been played non-stop since arrival.

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I believe this game is better then the other one this one isn't as glitchy and didn't take to long to understand the controls
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I suppose the biggest criticism that I can make for The Wise Man's Fear is that it seems to do so little to advance the plot this book feels less like a sequel and more like leftovers from The Name of the Wind. It's well written, and it certainly does much to expand the character and legend of Kvothe, but at the end I can't help but feel like a lot of it was fluff material. Random storyline tangents come up regularly, and seem to serve no purpose but to deliver on relatively inconsequential plot points (so far) that we saw in the first book.<br /><br />And yet despite all of this, I found it compelling as the first one. I only hope that the third book is sufficient enough to advance and conclude (if it is indeed to be the last in the series) the main plot.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Amazing very funny. These guys keep you on the edge of your seat. So to speak. They make it look so easy and original
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really hate to write this review. The first two books in the series were great-full of raw emotions, tension, energy and details lots of details.  This final installment seemed like it was written by a different person. The dialogue was stilted and forced. Someone else mentioned that without titles on the chapters it was often difficult to tell who was speaking and that is very true. I found myself repeatedly going back to check the title of a chapter because I couldn't tell who was talking much of the time because everyone sounded the same. The characters were flat, underdeveloped and I didn't really feel anything about any of them. The premise of GDs and GPs felt like a lecture on human nature. Too much time was spent on that explanation (which sounds odd because there really weren't many actual details) and not enough time on character interaction and development. Except for a few characters we didn't get to know any of the people living in the compound or the fringe.  This book felt rushed to print and I wish I had stopped after the first two-which I thoroughly enjoyed and didn't want to put down. I had to force myself to finish reading it and found myself skimming the final chapters in boredom. To be fair I went back and forced myself to read them completely but still felt the same-bored. Very disappointing ending to what started out as a great series. I need to add to my original review. Its not all about Tris dying or not dying as so many people are complaining about. That  has nothing to do with my review. Its about the overall construction of the third book. Compared to the first two it is flat and two dimensional.The plot, the pacing, the repetitive narrative. It left me feeling bored, cheated, disappointed. I will follow an author's idea anywhere as long as the ride is a quality work of writing. This author has already proven herself capable of excellent writing but not with this book. I hope she takes a hard look at how her style has changed and returns to the passionate way of writing of her younger years.

B006RXPUR2|5.0|I had not heard much about it when it was first released so I was pleasantly surprised watching this movie.  The story (more appropriately interwoven STORIES) was fascinating.  The characters were wonderfully multi dimensional. This is the kind of movie that makes you question what is right, what is wrong, who decides, and who has to live with those decisions.  I highly recommend it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The colors are very easy on the eyes in the middle of the night or early am.<br />Having it the Kindle is convenient.
B00AEBBAF4|1.0|I purchased this movie solely for Tom Cruise's contribution.  I assumed that if Tom Cruise would be caught dead in this Ben Stiller-ish garbage there must be something tangentially worthy about it - WRONG!!!  If you are a fan of good cinema and a Tom Cruise believer, steer clear of this extremely stupid embarrassment of a movie.  However, if you're a Ben Stiller fan, by all means, purchase multiple copies and enjoy.  Just when you thought Ben Stiller couldn't possibly out-do himself in the stupid cinema genre you'll be left unbelieving of how he pulled off yet another masterpiece for the inane cinema effort.<br /><br />If you're a member of the undead Zombie demographic, you too MIGHT find this slightly enjoyable, OR it might make you so angry as to prompt you to make Ben Stiller your newest recruit.  Would you want him as a recruit???<br /><br />This movie has the distinction of being the first item I will ever Trade-In to Amazon.  Though the amount I'll receive is but a pittance, it's more than I'll receive by throwing it away, which was the consensus favorite before inquiring into the Trade-In option.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|I saw it on TV, I had to have it, get my own copy to add to my collection, allot of action, this movie was very similar to the book, the acting was also great, Hugh Jackman was superb, Kate Beckinsale was also superb, it was sad to see her die in the end, but, his character was cured, he no longer had to fear full moons
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved reading this book and really enjoyed the format with 9 experiments; one to do every 2-3 days. I wanted to do all of the experiments individually - but I couldn't put this book down and finished it from start to finish one lazy Sunday. I will now have the pleasure of going back to the individual chapters and their corresponding experiments! Funny, light, easy to read and a great refresher course on the law of attraction principles. Thanks!
B00003CWRX|3.0|I liked the movie, the second time around<br />there wasn't much action, actually, there was none<br />it was kind of A sleeper
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally!! I have been waiting for this game! It is very addictive!! I love it and don't want to put it down. Don't really like having to wait for a life though!!!!!!

B001S31MTQ|4.0|The Doors of Perception is Huxley's narrated account of a time he took \\"four-tenths\\" of a gram of mescalin and tripped under the watch of an observant peer. Some of the text is a record of things he said and thought during the experience, some is commentary, elaboration, and interpretation. Some of his account is in plain English and serves to bridge the gap between what he was experiencing and what most of us experience daily. Other parts were more esoteric and, without having been there before, is tougher to comprehend. I particularly liked his reflection on humanity's appetite for self-transcendence that begins on pg. 62. He considers the various chemical modifiers of consciousness, focusing on both the mental effect and physiological price of each drug. He doesn't get explicitly political, but I imagine it leaves most USA readers a little indignant about the irrationality of our laws re: chemical modes of self-transcendence. For all the value that conscious altering drugs offer, which through his recounting of his experience + commentary, he has made a strong case for, one would think that the govt. would need a damn good reason to forbid them. Considering how dangerous tobacco and alcohol are, it must not be solely a matter of harm to humans. The most obvious implied explanation is that laws are intended to keep us away from the mind's antipodes. Could this be the case? If so, how inappropriate and kinda creepy.<br /><br />Heaven and Hell is a study of the modes of accessing the mind's far corners of perception and experience. He focuses on art, colors, chemicals, objects and historical circumstances- ordered by most considered to least. He makes some compelling arguments linking humans' appreciation for certain things to their corresponding ability to bring us to visionary experience. Some of Heaven and Hell gets boring, but I think it's because I have a difficult time relating to the kinds of experiences that the various vision-inducing things can create.<br/><br />The two short works plus the bonus material at the end of Harper's version all taken together made me appreciate the worth of alternative states of consciousness. It makes sense that we modern folk have a bias for normal waking consciousness because thus far it's been the most industrially productive (if we're counting effects of caffeine and not counting adderall etc.) Plus, most religious traditions that influence modern western thought are fairly conservative about which means of reaching spiritual experience are appropriate. If you approach this book with a willingness to reconsider your reasons for discounting alternative forms of consciousness, I think you'll understand why this book is considered a modern classic.
B009C7JS14|4.0|the app works great. it is so convenient to hit one button and have the weather right there. makes it easy.
0061950726|5.0|This story crabs ahold of your emotions. The story is so captivating you will regret when the the book reaches the end.. Made me hungry for more Christine Baker Kline books. This book is her best so far
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very glad it's finally on Kindle, so addicting I can now use only one tablet THE KINDLE ..Thanks Amazon...great addition..
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I must admit that I saw many of the one star reviews of this book after I had started it and was so disheartened that so many fans, like myself, felt so negative about the final book in this amazing trilogy. I didn't read any of the one star reviews that contained spoilers because I wanted to finish the book on my own but I was scared to finish it at the same time. I'm so glad I did finish it on my own though. I realize that most people had a problem with Tris dying and Four and Tris not getting their happy ending. But I see it differently. They did get their happiness, they acknowledged they were the forever kind of relationship that stood up to every hardship and still held immense love. They saw the things that they brought out in one another and in their last days were truly together. She died not wanting to leave him and while I definitely wanted Caleb to go, not her, I loved knowing that the love between Tris and Four was in tact and whole not fractured like I worried it was going to be.<br /><br />I think each reader will feel their own about this ending but I cried for the love they had and the love he had even after she was gone. That was beautiful to me. We don't always get the ending we want from a book but I don't think this book' sending deserves all the negative reviews it's getting.<br /><br />I gave it four out of five because of course I wanted them together in the end but ultimately I still loved the book.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|Thought it would be fun, but it's stupid. It keeps turning upside down and frustrating me. I would not recommend this app.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Horror fans know that this is one of the greatest horror films of all time...often ranked number one, so I'm not going to do this movie the injustice of trying to review it. There aren't to many extras on this blu-ray, but it's the best looking and sounding version of The Shining that I've seen. For less than $10, you can't beat it.<br /><br />On a side note...my favorite thing about this purchase: I have been a fan of the movie for many many years, but had never read the book. After reading the book I got obsessed with wanting to see the movie on blu-ray. The last version I purchased was in standard format on DVD. After killing a Saturday afternoon trying to locate one around Tulsa, I gave up and ordered a copy on Amazon. I was happy because of the price, but felt defeated because I had had my heart set on watching it that night. But within minutes I got an email from Amazon letting me know that I could watch the HD version online instantly for no additional cost! Needless to say, I was stoked. It's the little things...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME! Very addicting. I have been playing it for 1 hour strait! LOL! This app is a lot like temple run but I like this app better because of the different gadgets

0307454568|5.0|The third book in this wonderfully riveting series by Stieg Larsson - as well written and as full of surprises and intrigue as its two predecessors.  Continuing plot lines and character development make it hard to put down!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  It took me a while to get it, since it was unavailable for so long!  But, well worth the wait.  Very challenging.  I compete with my family!!!  So much fun and very addictive!
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|I purchased the deluxe version on itunes only to get the Our Love and MacArthur Park (vocal version) remixes and after reading some's unsettling opinions (IMO), I felt compelled to speak (my) truth. First of all, the ONLY tracks worthy of being on this cd are Hot Stuff and Last Dance. Why, because not only do they present great modern takes on each track, but they are respectfully done and equally important, they actually feature Donna Summer's vocals. \\"Hot Stuff\\" is housed up by the House king himself (Frankie Knuckles) keeping the trademark riff of the original in tact while shedding the dated back ground chants making this remix the star of the show. Equally impressive is Master at Work's \\"Last Dance\\", which I will agree is a smidge loungey, which may be due to the remix slow pace compared to the energetic original), it's clear that care was taken with this remix with pauses for strings and nuances. You can practically hear M@W's respect for Donna on this remix. These two are clearly the best songs on the cd.<br /><br />The next best track is the remix of MacArthur Pack remix w/ vocals (only on the Deluxe Version). At first listen, it sounds like an arrangement from American Idol, but then it thoroughly brings you in with it's obvious update but equally faithfulness to the original's music. And only Donna's vocals can complete this song. It's a modern take that demands your attention. Making the remix with vocals the third song worthy on being this release.<br /><br />The orginal Love Is In Control (Finger on the Trigger) is one of my all time favorite Donna Summer song. It was her first and only foray into REAL early 80's r&b/dance (ie. music by Change, Cheryl Lynn, Kano etc). So, with that in mind, this remix though very upbeat, remains unimpressive. Another fault is that it does not contain any nuances from the original. The new male voices singing the title does NOT sound better than the original vocoder voice, which could've been left in to retain some typeof essence of the original since the remix music is so different from the awesome, untouchable frenetic sound of the original. Only good thing is that LIIC was chosen over a more predictable choice (\\"She Works Hard For The Money\\") for a remix to represent a Donna Summer 80's hit.<br /><br />Dubs (AKA instrumentals with scarse or no vocals) were never my favorite and are better suited on cd singles, unless superbly done, which is rare which bring me to Our Love, which is okay. \\"Dim all the Lights\\" and especially \\"On The Radio\\" don't fare well. With OTR getting less respect due to both the lack of Donna's vocals and the bad echo effect on the few vocals that actually on the song. These two remixes are NOT favorites of mine.<br /><br />And the Worst of All .... (drum roll).... The horrible remix of \\"Working the Midnight Shift\\" using a freakin' different singer. WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You don't do no mess like that. This Holy Ghost person is a moron, him OR whoever record company prick who thought it was a good idea for a cover version to be on THIS particular album. It's total disrespect to not use Donna's voice, especially at this time. The music's okay but I still HATE this remix because another person is on it. It has NO place on the cd.<br /><br />The other remixes are just there. The two versions of \\"I Feel Love\\" is just overkill. With alot of focus being on the awesome original version lately, I guess I can see why, but still the Banga remix should've just been a bonus track on the deluxe version with \\"Our Love\\" getting the available spot on the standard album.<br /><br />Giorgio Moroder or not, the \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" remix is another NON favoite. The music sounds like some suped up Ace of Base or Gwen Stefani (who remade the song on the Zoolander soundtrack) with Donna Summer's vocals being the only saving grace. Another missed opportunity (along with \\"On The Radio\\" and \\"Dim All The Lights\\"). The beat just does not work for me.<br /><br />To any review haters, I am a longtime Donna Summer fan, but I am not stuck in the 70's because I don't like SOME of these remixes. It's a matter of knowing if these updates do justice, or properly honor the original which is kinda the point of this album. These remixes will never best the original versions, and I understand that the remixers weren't trying to do so. So if their music will introduce a younger audience to the music of Donna Summer, I guess I can accept only liking a handful of the songs of the cd. As I will continue to support Donna Summer and all her music.<br /><br />UPDATE... I forgot to mention how great the Hot Chip re-edit of \\"Sunset People\\"  on the deluxe version is. It's just slightly different from the album version but still sounds updated and a definite reason to buy the cd. And after a bit more listening, there are more of Donna's vocals on \\"Bad Girls\\" (Gigamesh remix),  \\"Dim All The Lights\\" and \\"Our Love\\" than I previously thought which make these remixes  sound better to me. And while it may take a little time, I could tolerate the remix of \\"On The Radio\\". \\"La Dolce Vita\\" sounds like a track from Crayons, just with some minor tinkering by Giorgio Moroder, which is alright I guess, except with the guitar bits which someone here claimed sounded like Daft Punk's \\"Get Lucky\\" (ie. Chic-like). But that's okay. So even though my favorites haven't changed, I do feel compelled to give the cd a much better rating. It's definitely worth purchasing. I just wished the deluxe version was available on cd format with artwork and credit information. Only Donna Summer could get me to buy a digital album without the physical content I normally insist on having.

B0068PHS5Q|4.0|Really enjoyed this novel, could not put it down.  The descriptive style of writing of Diane Setterfield made me feel like I had been transported into the story.  The ending was unpredictable and I felt drawn into the story from start to finish.  This was my first read from this author and it certainly won't be my last.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Successful at understanding the mindset of communism with great writing. Personalities really well developed, so real, ...everyone deserves sympathy. Great.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I hated the ending to this series. I won't spoil it by saying what happened but be prepared to be disappointed.  It was a difficult read from the beginning because she switches back and forth from Tris' and Four's point of view. The first book was great. The second was a good read but had moments when it was boring. This last book drug on forever without anything great to say about it. Not sure why the author would choose to end this way. Maybe she'll be smart and write an alternate ending.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the first two books. This book is very good also.<br />The rest may contain spoilers......<br />I believe many readers are rating this book based on things they didn't want to happen in the book. Readers tend to get attached to characters and expect a perfect happy ending. This book has a good ending....just the way the author choose for it to. Things don't always go the way we think or choose for them to. It doesn't mean we should rate the book negatively.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Luckily, I was given the book to read by a friend, as I would never have picked this one up on my own.  I was delightfully surprised as this was excellent.  I am anxious to start the next one, as I am eager to know what happens to all the characters, but was devastated to learn that the third books has not been written yet - oh my!  The story is intriguing, fresh, original, intelligent, and complicated.  This book crosses all genres as it is a love story - although they never make love, it is a mystery, definably paranormal with witches and vampires - but is not your usual witches and vampire tale as they are mature, successful and well-educated professors, historians, scientists, and generally nice people.  The book is thick and not a fast read, but I enjoyed every bit of it and was sad to turn to the last page.  Ms. Harkness is very clever and extremely talented.  Her writing is top shelf.  I look forward to losing myself in the second one soon, and hope she is currently locked in her attic and slaving away on the third.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|While it's not exactly a secret anymore who Benedict Cumberbatch plays, I still felt compelled to add the SPOILERS disclaimer even though it says it on the back cover description lol. Cumberbatch delivers quite possibly the greatest performance in all of Star Trek history as the new Khan!!<br /><br />I understand the uproar of casting a Caucasian as Khan. However, for the purposes of that twist toward the end, it was a good choice. It was the perfect casting decision to have Cumberbatch play Khan. Best one ever!

1401201911|2.0|The best comics are powered by exciting new ideas that make the reader think in new ways.  A good comic might just have new ideas.  This comic didn't meet either of these criteria.  \\"Red Son\\" takes an old and simplistic fear and inserts Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman into it.  What, communism is BAD and leads to authoritarian control?  That's old hysteria and isn't very interesting.  How about showing an America that eliminated all communist and socialist ideas, had unfettered capitalism where money rules all, and gave NO power to the people?  You would get a small society of the super-rich and most people would be desperately poor.  America in the 50s and 60s was heavily influenced by the communist idea that the people should have power, not just the bosses.  Demonize Superman, take the labor unions away from America and show what the super-rich can do to the masses who are wage slaves.  Show Wonder Woman fighting for social justice, show the women and children sleeping in the streets.  That would really strike a chord with Americans today.  How about showing Superman dealing with the inherent problems of communism such as lack of incentive to invest in technology and infrastructure.  Show Superman succeeding by injecting some capitalist ideas into communism.  Happiness that we Americans can't have, now that would be subversive!  Communism, just like capitalism is not inherently oppressive.  But they both need BALANCE and a strong, educated middle class to be successful.  Last, Wonder Woman in this story is just an old, bitter, and lonely hag. Not only is this sexist and out-dated, it does nothing for the story.  Sigh.  I can't recommend \\"Red Son\\" to anyone.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Turn back while you still can, this book may not be worth the heartache<br />So amazing, so painful, so worth it
B000V39KDO|5.0|I thought the movie was action packed and warriors and special effects were awesome. The movie showed love,compassion and loyalty for a common cause. Not onetime did the king forget about his love for queen nor did she forget about her love and did all she could to to send aid to her king to help fight.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome product I can't seem to not Ute out everyday I get home from work during the days. Thanks Google
B004HWYTP4|4.0|It was all the spy stuff you would and could expect. It shows how our government (one can) easily become corrupt and use our military resources for personal gain. Very entertaining and funny.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like being able to set up my Kindle as an alarm clock. Both of us can now see the time and we're good with that.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|this is a good old movie from the good old days hope you like it ..this is one for the holidays an sundays.
B00BMKH5NW|3.0|For all of the hype and anticipation, I was a little let down. The novel has a great premise and the characters are cute, but the writing style did not impress me. I don't know if it is because the novel is meant for younger readers than myself, or if there was something lacking in the writing. It just did not read like something I'd find in a bookstore. I guess that's what you get sometimes when a work is self-published.<br /><br />However, I will give the book props for its creativity. The author took a creative spin with college romances, and made me actually want to see how it worked out. I think the romance is a bit too obvious at the start, but the main character's awkwardness is really enjoyable. The author does a good job making realistic and enjoyable characters, so it makes up for lack of professional writing.<br /><br />I also like that the novel is a NaNoWriMo winner. Always great to see finished works become successful. I would have maybe liked to seen the story fleshed out a little more through editing.<br /><br />I can see why the novel is popular for sure, but I guess overall I'm not a huge fan. Glad I did read it though. Just not my personal style. Do give it a try. Don't let me deter you, but I think it is more for younger readers who don't like to get bogged down in detail. Check it out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the Downton Abbey series.  I can't wait to watch Season 4. Interesting to see what happens next...
0316204366|5.0|This is another set of New Yorker profiles written by Malcolm Gladwell. The book's theme is that some disadvantages may really be advantages. David had an advantage over Goliath because Goliath was slow and dumb and David was smart and clever. Maybe some people with dyslexia have an advantage because they must use their oral and listening skills.<br /><br />The weakest profile is that of David Boies, a famous lawyer with dyslexia. Boies is a great lawyer, but the profile does not do him justice. Its too weak and flimsy and unimpressive. I was left with the feeling that Boies, who graduated from Yale, can read far better than he lets on and is far more able than Gladwell understands.<br /><br />The best article is on a student who went to Brown, but dropped out of science. The theme is that our schools force too many good science students to drop out and, in the case of those who attend elite universities, many students would be better off going to a school that is less competitive. This is more typical of Malcolm Gladwell. His writing is usually contrarian and his article usually challenges the conventional wisdom. A classic example is his article on school class sizes. Classes can be too small and sometimes large classes produce really bright students.<br /><br />The most interesting person profiled was Andre Trocme, a Hugenot who protected many French jewish children during World War II. Trocme had a disadvantage in that he was a minority, a Hugenot in a Catholic country.<br /><br />In sum, a fine book, with one weak profile of David Boies and other excellent profiles that challenge our way of thinking.
B00FI7XBIS|3.0|Enjoyable VAMPIRE app that has decent challenges that get harder as you go along.  You have to collect ROCKS and BOMBS to aim and shoot at various hazards like Fatal Light Beams, Skeletons and  Flying Bats.  You also use varying Strategies to BREAK LIGHTS or Block their Beems or Destroy Skeletons by aiming your Vampire shots at Lights, Piles of Rocks,  Giant Rolling Balls, Balance Levers to move blocking items, etc.  Unique, CLEVER PUZZLES keep you Engaged and Challenged.  Your Vampire must reach a Beautiful Girl that is sleeping in a bed.  Each level ends with a BITE on the neck or a KISS (ha-ha).  Scoring is affected by number of shots missed and COINS are also awarded that can be used to buy more AMMO.  If you do well, you get to play the BONUS LEVELS in the last Chapter.  3D Graphics are Smooth, Cute and Funny.  A Cute Monster Story too.  Music and Sound Effects are perfect for the Goulish VAMPIRE THEME.<br /><br />Sadly the Screen GETS JUMPY, Cuts off TARGET areas and MOVES YOUR VIEW unexpectedly (on 10\\" Tablet).  This makes shooting accuracy HARDER THAN NECESSARY.  Missing shots and annoyances detract from fun!<br /><br />Overall, a Cute and Unique PHYSICS GAME with challenging Aim and Shoot levels.  You control the Direction and Strength of each shot with one finger.  Some levels make you work a little harder to figure out the needed Strategy.  If you get stuck, they have a SOLUTION Option that you may select from the Menu.  You can REPLAY levels to improve score at any time.  Music and Sounds can be Muted also.  The CONTROLS are FRUSTRATING and so is the occasional failure to detect your touch to move the Vampire.  Very annoying so I deduct 2 Stars.  After playing Entire game, I am disappointed because it has great potential but is TOO AGGRAVATING!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting. Really love this game. Would recommend this game to anyone of any age. Fun for the whole family.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Not as funny as the othee two novies and kinda dark movie for a comedy. By itself its an OK movie.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I really enjoyed this.  It was a little predictable, but it did fill me in on this part of history.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Fast moving, full of action...I couldn't put it down between breaks, although I tried. Just kept thinking -one more chapter then I'll do some work.  No luck.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game, and now there's an update. I'm so exited and recomend this game for any body. I have a kindle fire, and it works great..
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Amazing!  So glad we added this to our collection.  The ending is so wonderful with the reunion of former stars.  We all love it!
0316204366|2.0|I have not read the book nor intend to read it after listening today to Mr. Gladwell's interview with Fareed Zakaria. Whatever Mr. Gladwell's agenda is, using the David and Goliath story in 1 samuel to make his point is meaningless in that Mr. Gladwell creates non-evidence-based theories, and ignoring a whole body of Biblical hermeneutics that provides context to the story. Written by an unknown author designated as Deuteronomist  (who wrote the Deuteronomy-2 Kings books), this priestly author had a clear pro Judahite monarchic agenda that aimed to glorify the Davidic line and discredit the Israelite monarchic dynasty established by King Saul. The David and Goliath pericope is propagandistic to its core. The size of Goliath is a metaphor for the \\"many against the few\\", and has nothing to do with acromegaly. As well, how could Goliath be mortally wounded by a stone-blow to the head which was well protected by an oversized and heavy bronze helmet? Other Philistine commander is described elsewhere as having 24 digits. All Philistines are derogatorily portrayed as uncircumcised and David is all too happy to extirpate the foreskins of 200 Philistine corpses. Mr. Gladwell's assertion that the battle in the Elah Valley was over control of the Hill Country is unsustainable. The Philistine city- states were, like the Phoenicians, interested in trade and in keeping trade routes open. There was no trade route from their city to Jerusalem and beyond. The trade route between the Philistine Pentapolis and Transjordan passed through the Negev (a route used also by the Bedouins and Nabataeans, and the route through the Jesreel Valley. Besides, given that the Bible provides several instances that point to cooperation between David and the Philistines, it is not clear at all why the Israelites and the Philistines (like the Amalekites) became mortal enemies. The death of King Saul was the author's way to terminate the Israelite royal lineage, making room for the YHWH-chosen David. Itseems to me that Mr. Gladwell should have refrained from picking the \\"David and Goliath\\" story to make his point, as he clearly has chattered, to him, unfamiliar waters
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is one of the most useful apps i have. and you cant beat the price ...free its worth cjecking out imo
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|My kids and I love this game. Non stop fun and my 4 year old never puts it down yay!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is highly addictive!  The only complaint I have is you only get 5 lives and the wait time between games is ridiculous.  Otherwise, fun game.
B003U2QHB6|3.0|A fun video to watch,  Good to kill an hour or two of time.  Was much better when I was younger though.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The app works exactly as advertised and the free version is not overly loaded with ads. I highly recommend it. It is very easy to use.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|I caught this excellent documentary on CNN, watched it 3 times. While I don't wish to speak bad of the dead, and I will be royally slimed, no doubt, wasn't Dawn Brancheau just part of the problem? She trained this top of the chain carnivore to do stupid human tricks, things Nature never intended, and everyone wrings their hands wondering why this animal attacked. Orcas eat warm, bloody MAMMALS, not dead cold fish. Dawn was a warm bloody mammal and Nature just took its course. Same as with \\"pet\\" lions and tigers. If she and other trainers really felt for these animals, they would walk out, quit!! Seaworlds cannot display these animals without trainers. Therefore, all you orca trainers out there, merely refuse to deal with these animals and maybe they can be released back into the wild which in its own way is more humane than being trapped for eternity in a big bathtub.<br /><br />Very well done!
B00C5R8364|5.0|This book was not only entertaining but very informative of what goes on in our world today.  Naysayers of the use of drones should be required to read this book... It is an eye opener.  I gave it five stars because it is a book that would appeal to just about every reader... And I mean from mid teens to seniors of both genders.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|this app is entertaining and a little challenging at times..when I am bored I always resort to this game. fun

B004GJXQ20|3.0|The Game of Thrones was way too bloodthirsty for me. If you take away all the blood and guts there's not much story left. If you don't like gore then don't read it
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|I loved this movie, it had a couple of twists which I've always thought  made a movie more interesting. I think Julienne is becoming a great actress!
8888493190|4.0|Though the outside seemed worn the pages themselves were great, I enjoy my purchase. Thank you for the mike giant book.
B00DJ80VLS|1.0|I can't honestly believe that I get a replacement disc because the DVD-Audio disc doesn't play and the brand new replacement does the same! I had just bought another multi channel cd and it played fine.<br />I would like someone to tell me if I'm the only one having this problem, or was their some technical glitch when they shipped out a certain batch.<br />I'm not going to return it for a third time as I feel it will be more of the same. I just want someone to tell me if this is a problem with production or what!<br />Thanks in advance...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have Temple Run and Subway Surfers on my kindle. When I got Minion Rush, it was even more addictive than those 2 games. I really love the Halloween update.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoy this app...got the free version first, & recently upgraded to this.  I have my own special blend of sounds that I listen to every day.  I hope that they will add even more sounds in the future.  Listening with the earbuds has a very relaxing & calming effect, & I highly recommend this to everyone!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Few are the works that require such thoughtful reflection as Hugo' s opus. The reader should hesitate long before committing to the discipline and maturity that are prerequisite to this study.
B000059TFO|5.0|he casting of the two major protagonists is perfect - he level head esus he emotional one,  The story demonstrates that pur reasonablness is often not enough when solving a problem
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much...Its like caretaking virtually!!<br />I hope you all create another one but with wild animals like (deer;bears).
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|I've enjoyed the endeavor of reading many books like this over my lifetime.  I already know that my thoughts create my surroundings.  However, the way Pam speaks in this book is very direct; almost demanding, and her exercises did not work out for me.  I think the reason for this is because her exercises were not something that I intrinsically wanted or needed, so even though I put my mind to them, I did not organically connect with her 'commands' and therefore failed.<br /><br />Long story short - the purpose behind the book is to open your mind to your great strength... your thoughts.  This book may work for some, but it did not work for me.  Nor did it really provide me any insight that I hadn't already learned through other enterprises.
0385523394|5.0|Loved it and I would tell others to buy this book if they are interested in reading about restorative justice.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Not worth the rental cost. Unintelligible plot. Voice sometimes not in sync, and sometimes not understandable.<br />Save your money.<br />If you must see it, it's cheaper on Netflix.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Frightening, especially since it was based on a true story. Many jump out of your seat and cover your eyes moments.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I have watched this movie a half dozen times already and loved it every time. the 3d version is great. this and promethius are my 2 fav movies at the moment. both have amazing 3d and are thrill rides from front to back. this obviously being the more action packed one but both so amazing. anyone who loves action and big ass robots killing big ass monsters will love this. i have nothing bad to say about it. i can only hope for more. kick ass Del<br />torro thank you!
B0026OR1UK|5.0|Phenomenal across the board. As a golf instructor and professional I've seen first hand the importance if Deep Practice. Daniel Coyle proves it Period.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|I'm a big Nesbo fan, but The Bat just was not suspenseful. It was interesting meeting a young Harry Hole, especially when he actually had a rather normal relationship with a young woman, but then, once more, the author had to send him back to a downward drinking spiral.<br />The author spends more time on local color and stories that he does building the plot. Can't recommend this one, sorry.
B004JMY312|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Better Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, witches and halloween magic. What more could you ask for?
1936608898|5.0|Very direct approach to what different food groups do to a body...plenty of easily understood science to back it up, with loads of references. I especially like the practical tips on portions and at least where to start.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Seriously,  the best movie ever.  I watch it once a week and bought the :poster. Well written, acted and directed.  :-)
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was mildly disappointed with this book. Perhaps the pressure was on since its being made into a movie.  The first 1/3 and the last 1/3 were the best part. The middle was borderline mind numbing. It took me 3 days instead of my usual 1 to get through.  I felt the big picture result was mostly satisfying albeit sad.
B0084670FU|3.0|Plot was poor and acting only fair. Well known actors but material was not the best and they could not overcome it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Plot was interesting and kept you involved. The acting was top notch as one would expect from the old pros in the film
B00G32TD98|4.0|I watched this with my 16 year old and we both enjoyed it. There are several suspenseful scenes and a terrifying finale that left us shaken,  considering this film is based on true events.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Cher has outdone herself.  Close To The Truth is the best Cher album ever.  I highly recommend listening to the entire album from start to finish.
B00B23O96A|2.0|it is very old sock not his best work.even when Eric does other peoples songs he makes it he s own.he always has great tast but this time not so much.calling it old sock was he s first mistake.we expect better from him
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Good movie, I would recommend this as a family and kid friendly movie for everyone.  My daughter liked it a lot
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is the best game ever!! Make more of the same.<br />But with different objects. And more lives and more time to play.
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|An enjoyable read with likeable characters. Not too predictable or over the top. Good read after a hard days work.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|FUN app love it very very much do you LIKE IT hope you LIKE It is my favorite game is it yours !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001VLXNLU|2.0|I was given this book by a friend of mine. I really didn't like this. It's a vampire book, done completely different which the premise didn't pull me in at all.<br /><br />I won't recommend this series. Sorry
B003K16P3M|5.0|I am giving it five stars because of numerous things. First of all I think the story line and all the plots is amazing, keeping you wanting to read more. I guess its the other reason why I finished this almost five hundred page book in just three days. The way its written also gets a star. I always ask my self if I have learned anything after reading a novel and with Graceling my answer is double yes. It is not easy to write a novel in third person but Graceling was beautifully done and the vocabulary is of such a nature that I have learned not just new words but new ways to express one self. That is what I am looking for in a story. I think Graceling is well written and definitely a page turner. Guess it won't be everybody's cup of tea but if you are a true fantasy fan, you will absolutely love it. It is very realistic and that is what I love the most. None of it is far fetched and I do hope that it reach the success it deserves. Two thumbs up for Graceling. I can't wait to read Fire.
0060318252|5.0|Anything by Peter Drucker is worth the time invested.  Recently I started working with a young pastor, first pastorate.  I gave it to him to read.  And I decided to re-read it myself.  Course correction for me!  While I have molded myself in the image of the effective executive, I realized that I had gotten rusty on some important points.  So it is always a great read.<br /><br />Also, if anyone takes 7 Habits to heart, they can see how Covey comes after Drucker.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Short Review:  Not great, but not nearly as bad Amazon Reviews would lead you to believe.  Overwhelmingly the negative reviews are complaining about the ending.  I am not going to blow the ending, but I thought it was fine.  It was not a happy ending, but it is a dystopian book, they are not supposed to have happy endings.  I do have a problem with a lack of coherence with the setting.  The size of the factions, the level of technology the actual geography (you can see O'Hare from the Hancock building on a clear day) are all problematic to the story telling.  But fiction books frequently have problems being fully coherent.  Similarly the writing as a bit flat.  But there are very good books that are intentionally written flat (The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is a good dystopian example.)<br /><br />But when you mix all of the problems together it really shows.  It just was not as good as it should have been.  I wanted to love it.  But I just could not. But it was not nearly as bad as all of the 1 star reviews would lead you to believe.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a great little book with practical exercises that allow you to test and strengthen your energetic muscles..... It's a pleasure to read.
0375869026|5.0|This is a book that rocked my moral compass! Well written. Sensitive yet strong. A must read for kids an adults alike!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Easy to use.<br />requires no set up or rooting of device.<br />Fast file transfer with no cable.<br />Works on all my device's
B00AVXVQGI|3.0|I found this jumped around too much for me, and it ended abruptly.  I would not recommend.  I only continued because it was our book club book.
006202406X|2.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />I am indifferent about Tris' death, which is a sad statement after 3 books.  I hated the two person POV.  As other commenters mentioned, there was no real distinction between the voices.  I'd get a couple pages into a new chapter and discover I was thinking of the wrong character.  I kept thinking that Tobias thinks/talks like a girl.  I get why she did it. She decided to kill Tris (stupid name as an aside) and then thought she'd need another POV to carry on the story.  Not so. It would've been just as easy to switch narrators after the death.  I also didn't like the setting of the outside world as a bombed out version of the US.  It would've been more effective as just a nondescript place. All the references to Chicago O'Hare fell flat.  It was also super sketchy on the details.  If it was so easy to waltz in and out of the city, why not do it more often?  Also, did anyone else notice the repetition in the descriptions?  Everyone's lip curls, Tris always pulls on Tobias's shirt or belt loops, etc.
031624662X|4.0|Not since FOREIGNER have I felt so immersed and utterly and wonderfully lost in an alien culture. Ann Leckie's book pulls you into the many perspectives of Breq/Justice of Toren/One Esk-Nineteen, in a satisfying way. This is high-concept science fiction for thinking readers, and grand entertainment.<br /><br />One warning: stick with the book. The opening chapters are somewhat confusing, but that's because Leckie's concept takes time to unfold.<br /><br />Well-written, engaging, I highly recommend what may become one of the best SF reads of the year.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Interesting way to follow people you respect and know.<br />Easy way to stay in touch with people's activities and thoughts.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|Funny, but no where near as good as the others.  Actually felt a little cheated at the end.  Oh well.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Great to have network of people. in industry and connect with people I know.<br />Easy to use and real time.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|It was a great love story didn't expect it to be the way it was.So you see it is never to late to fall in love.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was drawn into the Magic of this book by the easy flowing descriptive words. Erin Morgenstern created a journey that I was drawn into and never wanted it to end.
B006AN78XS|5.0|Loved it will watch it over and over again. Did not expect it to be like it was recamend it to my friends.
B00FVW4CF6|1.0|I love this series and have bought every single one, but with season five too many technical glitches with downloading the episodes into the computer.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Life on the Mississippi is ever changing, as is the river. This is a wonderful story of love and growing.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Hard to get it to work when I touch the kindle screen.No instructions and it is not like an everyday calculator.
B002TXZRNQ|5.0|A small book but contains information which you can never afford to miss if you want to live a life full of happiness and contentedness. It taught me how to live so that when I am dying I have no regrets.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book still haunts me - I loved every word of it and I dreaded the minute when I would finish it.  I felt like I was  a part of the book and never wanted it to end.  Great development of characters- especially good reading for the underdogs and unique people.  Gave me a rare insight to the limitations of others.  Will read it again.  Can't wait to discuss it at Book Club.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|Excellent quality for the price<br />My son is happy with the Goku<br />It is really the same that the picture

B009LA1QW6|5.0|Lana Del Rey has a unique voice. Enjoy the music. Would prefer less explicit language though.<br /><br />Over all a great album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive and I'm thrilled I could finally download it on my Kindle.  I play this game all the time!!!
B007DIQC90|5.0|I hadn't heard of them before at all. I was watching Gotye and Lana Del Rey videos on youtube and it suggested a video by them. I watched it and really liked it so I decided to buy an album.<br /><br />I really enjoy the music and recommend it.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|The Everything Store is basically a road map for success.  The Book outlines how to be successful in the corporate world and in everything.  All the bad press this book is getting is missing the point.  Jeff and Amazon beats to its own drum and uses whatever advantage it can get.  But guess what?  EVERY successful company in the history of man has done the exact same.  Ruthless aggression, the passion to win, and the ability to sacrifice what others won't is how you become powerful.  Jeff is personification of success, and if you learn how to read between the lines in this book and apply its teachings you will as well.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I really enjoy Lana Del Rey. I only recently heard of her at all.<br /><br />I bought this one and Paradise and really like them both a lot.<br /><br />Would prefer less explicit language but still great albums.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally kindle added this game . passed the word to all my friends and family .love this game ~ can't put it down.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I like every song on this album.<br /><br />That is unusual for me. There is usually a song or two that I will skip when listening but not on this album.
B004SIP6WW|5.0|One sign of a great film is when each character's life seems to spill over the edges of fiction and narrative.  You can imagine a detailed past for every cop as clearly as you might a neighbor or co-worker.  Stallone is the big surprise here.  Virtually every trace of Rocky and Rambo are gone.  Keitel and DeNiro are as good as ever also.  I can see why so many talented actors were attracted to this script.  It presents a unique atmosphere and an ending that comes out of nowhere.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun game that helps pass time while waiting in lines or at appointments. Takes only a bit of skill, but keeps the brain moving quickly. I like that!
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|After Sacred Songs, I thought Sting had run out of ideas.  I appreciate the tangents that he has taken since then, Songs from The Labyrinth and On A Winter's Night and Those albums seemed to be pointing him in the direction that he has chosen to follow on this record.  I was encouraged by the fact that there was a common theme with The Soul Cages which happens to be my favorite of his, soI purchased the 20 song version and was not disappointed.  I give Sting credit for realizing that trying to create a top 10 album might not be in his best interest in today's musical climate.  He's been there, he doesn't need to have a top 10 song anymore and sell millions of records.  He does have the freedom to follow his interests and try to create a good collection of songs, which I believe he's done.  There's nothing 'pop' about this record, but if you approach it as an English folk album, you may enjoy it.  The fact that the Unthank sisters are on it should give you some idea of where this album is coming from and if you like their work, there's at least a good chance you'll enjoy this album.  Regarding the extra tracks, I have enjoyed them within the overall concept of the record and have to say that I don't think any of them really feel like b-sides.  The second disc also contains my favorite track &#34;It's Not The Same Moon&#34;.  All in all, I am really enjoying this album and it has met my expectations going in and possibly even exceeded them.  I'm aware of the fact that this will be turned into a Broadway performance and I can see how this material could be adapted to that type of performance, but I feel this album stands on it's own as a fine record from Sting in the later part of his career.
B00ERIUO02|1.0|I purchased this album blindly and I wish I could take it back. I really enjoyed her last 2 albums but this one is just terrible :( I am a HUGE Katy Perry fan but I can also be honest. Her diehard fans will talk about how great this album is but its really not. The lyrics of each song are at the level of an 11 year old girl. I LOVE pop/techno music so Katy was my go-to girl but not anymore :( I have my fingers crossed that Gagas album will be far better than the applause bomb that she released.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Everyone pretty much summed up why the book was disappointing.  David,Evelyn,Marcus,Johanna,Tris dying,Tobias ending up working for Johanna.  I loved the first 2 books.  What happened to the third?
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|If you are a fan of the franchise you can't go wrong with this movie.  Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic and is Iron Man in the same way that Christian Bale owned Batman.  My issue with this title however is how the digital copy redemption has been muddied to the point of being painfully annoying.  Previously, codes were typically available for iTunes or UltraViolet copy.  Both have their strengths and weaknesses which I won't go into in this review.  My complaint with the new trend in digital copies is that now end users are sent to a website to enter their redemption code found inside the jacket.  Once entered, three options are presented.  Amazon Digital Copy, iTunes, or Vudu (UltraViolet).<br /><br />Now, choice is good, heck choice is FANTASTIC.  My complaint however arises from the fact that in order to try to get information about the service you have to click the link first.  Once you click the link, the redemption key is BOUND to that service, whether or not you actually choose to redeem the code.  Case in point, I was interested in reading more about the Amazon Digital Redemption so I clicked it to read the terms.  Decided I would rather have it in my Vudu library and tried to go back... low and behold every click towards another service would return a message that the key was already bound to Amazon.<br /><br />I can understand trying to prevent fraudulent redemption, but how can you build a platform that binds a user to an option before the same user has a chance to read the terms for the provider. At the VERY least, a warning alerting users that once they click on a service the key will be bound would be helpful.  Not to mention linking the TOS for each provider on the FIRST Page so that you can view them before proceeding.<br /><br />I didn't deduct stars because of this issue, the movie itself is fantastic.  Just a word of warning, be careful when you are getting your digital copy!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed The Shining and other books by Stephen King.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|A fun and dark read with a sharp, biting eye. Even after I finished this book my mind wanders back to the characters. Gillian Flynn has a knack for slowly revealing the layers of her characters and keeps the reader guessing.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I have had this device for about a month now. It is amazing. It makes moving my laptop much easier because I can unplug just one cable before moving from my desk. I just wish it had a longer cable on the end.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I loved this game from when it first came out and its been getting better and better every edition.  This one in 3-D is awesome!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this final book. It has the action, excitement and emotion of the previous books that make this series so awesome. It continues to explore the internal struggle of the issues that each character has as well as the characters' complex relationship with one another. I love the way this series has evolved from Divergent to Insurgent & ending with Allegiant. I love all the characters, especially Tris & Four & I'm really sad that this series has ended!
B00886XQO0|5.0|I bought these used and everything came in the box and works perfectly. they are really comfortable, they sound great, and the battery lasts for hours. love that they're wireless. I got these instead of the xp510 simply because of the Call of duty style to it. They have the same features as the xp510. I love the Bluetooth calling and the profiles. I use these on my PC, Xbox and PS3 with many different games and movies other than call of duty. They greatly enhance my gameplay experience.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I don't think I've ever read a trilogy that was soo disappointing. This book was completely boring and repetitive. Most of the story line was pointless dribble. I kept waiting for something to happen or for the book to go somewhere but it just fell flat!!! Nothing even started to happen until 60% in the book and then it builds you up for a ending that is irritating! I waited all this time for this??????? I wish I'd never even read it and I don't think I will see the movie. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a beautiful game which is becomes more and more challenging, but it isn't impossible to figure out how it works. I don't play many games, however I was devoted to Marble Drop. (I wish it were available for playing on Kindle..) Quell requires logic skills that are similar.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book, heartwarming story. Very easy read. I had been wanting to read the book for a while and it is definitely worth reading, I felt like it gave probably an honest view of how the kids felt.
B003WUYR6I|5.0|Very fast moving. Loved the suspense. Couldn't put it down. But I only see Matt as the Lincoln Lawyer now. Not sure I could ever accept another actor if there are future<br />Movies.
B00BATKPBE|4.0|I have read several of Dawkins's books and admire him greatly, both as a scientist and thinker and as a writer.<br /><br />I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that she couldn't quite comprehend the scientific experiments that Dawkins had done before the writing of the Selfish Gene.  I also found the author's descriptions of them a bit hard to comprehend (although I found no difficulty whatsoever in understanding the science in any of his other books).<br /><br />I also agree with that same reviewer about the need of more descriptions of Dawkins's feelings during some of the important milestones of his life.  After all, this is an autobiography, not a science book.  I hope to find more of that in the second half.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed his descriptions of the educational system at Oxford at the time he was a student and also the credit he gives to both of his parents.<br /><br />Another point I'd like to mention is that I watched the author's three interviews: on Book TV, with Bill Maher, and with John Stuart.  I noticed that both Sally Quinn and Bill Maher asked him about the \\"sneezing\\" reasoning at the end of the book.  Apparently, they both didn't understand his explanation in the book.  I have to say I didn't either.  I understood the general concept of the role of pure chance in shaping history, but he didn't make that clear in his \\"sneezing\\" explanation. So, I hope maybe he can address this point in the second half of his autobiography.<br /><br />As an aside, I thought he should have been content with his in-depth interview on a respected show like Book TV's After Words and not lower himself by appearing on \\"Real Time with Bill Maher\\" or \\"The Daily Show with John Stuart.\\"  I respect him too much to see him on shows of this caliber.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book left nothing to be desired, it had great correlation between &#34;The Shining&#34; and this one. I could not put it down, I read it in 3 days.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The DVD came in perfect condition. I only wish there were more extras!
1400069289|5.0|Very interesting subject matter handled in a concise well written way. Terrific book! Makes it easier to incorporate good habits into a daily routine.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The only thing I would change is being able to change volume of a sound already playing (with a long push activation for example).  Otherwise perfect for on the fly creativity while leading meditation.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast works great for watching Youtube.  However, if you want to watch a show you missed from a network online site, it will not cast a full screen view.  It will cast the tab and then when you click on full screen, the TV goes black.  You hear the voices and see it on the computer, but not on the TV.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the reminders, highlight features, etc. Easy to read, personalization is great. Choice of Bible version and languages  is truly extensive.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So well written and a wonderful story.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a good book.  On my top 10 list of favorite books
B00594M53M|4.0|twined stories, centered on a 30 plus one binoche and her dancer brother (no, he is NOT gay).  brother is informed that a heart transplant will be needed to save his life, as his own is failing...and that the transplant is also likely to.  have done this of impending death situation, and his response is quite reminiscent of my own.  terror apart, he finds his eyes have been opened to the miraculous, precious event that an ordinary human life actually is.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I don`t know if all the fanboys were happy with this film,but I was.The casting was good and the movie has a good balance of character development and action.Why some people were disappointed with the casting of Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury is beyond me,he was very good.Yes,this is a cgi movie but it flat out works,with some very cool battle scenes.It was faithful to the comic book without being slavish to it.I liked the scenes where the avengers bickered amongst themselves,the dialogue was terrific between Captain America and Iron Man.All in all,this was a highly enjoyable movie that I found to be very engaging.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition, still plastic wrapped. Very happy with this as it is for a gift.
B004ZISVRW|5.0|Hilarious. Awesome. Gorgeous. Has trolls. Probably the best mockumentary I've seen since Spinal Tap. That concludes this review. I'm off to live in Norway.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was amazing! It has it's ups and downs definitely keeping you guessing. A book of thrills and excitement! I would definitely like to read more of her books!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|As a fan of the original STAR TREK series, I am reluctant to accept  new versions that don't meet the standards of the original movies. The latest release meets those standards and deserves FIVE STARS. Well done, my CONGRADULATIONS to all the actors involved in the making of this movie.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|The touch ground of our insane wars! When we look behind of our history of killings, we have to understand where we arrived: Numbers 35:33 (KJV)!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The complexity is nailed in this book. Navigating a difficult era in human history, the Book Thief is wonderfully written. There is laughter and tears, heartbreak and triumph. Just amazing. I'm sure the film will make an okay movie but there's no way it can do the book the justice it deserves.
B0071CNGI8|1.0|I loved that book it was amazing I love horses so I loved it. Can't wait to read your other books. I love the ending about Emilie and her grandfather's promise to Albert and how he promised Emilie about Joey and the black horse.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I think the game is ok. But fail to find what's so wonderful?!?<br />I like it, but prefer to play Bejeweled or Candy Swipe...<br />The music is very nerve racking!<br /> I wish there was a setting to turn it off instead of having<br />to use my volume on my Kindle!<br /><br />Just don't know what all the hype is about....<br />So glad I didn't pay for it!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This account of the difficulty children face when raised in poverty and without a sense of belonging, demonstrates the human ability to survive! It was a page turner that skillfully provided an education in endurance and insight into human character.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I never could get into the story and directions of this book and I finally gave up and did not finish it.  It just did not seem to be worth my time and effort.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|If you listen to country music and enjoy thr new songs that come on the radio, then this album has the best songs out there for you. Florida Georgia Line has several amazing hits in this album and it was worth every dollar.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it! It needs some improvements, but it's still in beta so don't be worried. Looking forward to the vast improvements that are abound.
B00993FEUK|5.0|That is to say, it was a lot better than the advertising let on.<br /><br />I will caution that this movie is PG for a reason, some of the content is both too much for the young ones and some of the humor is a bit on the adult side.  That said, Paranorman is a very enjoyable movie that manages to keep you hooked with humor for the first two acts, and then really hits home with the drama in the third quite unexpectedly.  The sudden shift into drama at the end is a bit jarring, but very satisfying none the less.  It elevates what was a fun older kids flick with some borderline humor snuck in, to a truly recommendable go see it!<br /><br />The animation style is a bit edgy, I can see some people being turned off by it in the first two acts, but the third really steps it up several notches.  The casting is good, but most of the characters don't do much more than feed into the humor.  Standard fare for kids movies here.  The music and audio were both good, no problems there.<br /><br />In total, ParaNorman is a good older kids movie with some great easter-eggs and adult humor snuck in, and an unexpectedly meaty and dramatic closing.  Don't let the Halloween gimmick fool you, there's more here than seems at first glance.  Certainly worth a rent at least, I am going to buy.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The kite runner was great, then he wrote a thousand splendid suns and I thought ' this poor girl can not catch a break' and now I'm tired of his style and all his unremitting sadness.
B002LF2T4C|2.0|A bit too weird, though a likely accurate portrayal of Thompson's life.  Funny at times, Depp was great, as always.
B00CZ1HELA|5.0|love this game. very relaxing music and you can play for hours. love it play it every night to relax before bed
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|A Pendergast story is always a fun, inventive read--some more believable than others.  Our enigmatic Aloysius survives some very hairy i.e. \\"impossible\\" situations yet again.  However, he doesn't always succeed in producing the desired outcome.  Read and you shall see!!
B003M70O5O|5.0|Was really surprised by the great characters and the awesome job the actors/actresses do bringing them to life. Great job.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only thing I don't like is that you have to wait for more lives. Other than that it is great!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book!  Just like the other two. Keep it going Ms. Day  :) can't wait for the next one, please hurry up
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It's an ok game, a little childish, but I guess that's to be expected. Not really a game for adults.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|all of it I  awesome it is just like temple run but different it is a good game every kid likes it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush. Finally it is available for the kindle fire. I can play this game all day. I just wish more lives were available.
B00F2362IE|4.0|We came to own this game due to my 3yr old purchasing this and a couple of other apps on his own. Because of the incident and the price of the app I was pissed...  But I will say that it's the best of what he downloaded and actually a pretty good game. A little advanced(he plays but doesn't quite get it) for a 3yr old but he likes the cartoon and really enjoys watching me play. Good graphics and the ability to earn in game content sets this game apart from a lot of its rivals.
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|This had \\"I AM going to SCREW this up\\" and did not, WOW.  They did this VERY well and could create a Star Wars type following with the masses if they really wanted to and did it like this .<br />Great job keeping Master Chief in true form from the books and game. Would like to see more with MC....<br />Nice Job<br />Thank You ...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game I'm so glad that it is finally on my Kindle.<br />Now I can really beat my friends.<br />Hopper
B00ARF92HK|1.0|This is a poor quality action film that doesn't even qualify for passing time. There are almost infinite other films that would provide better entertainment than this one. So unless you exhausted every single of them, stay away from this one.
B0055MBQOM|1.0|The DVD/CD that came with the unit was not readable in my machine (Mac).<br />Downloaded the software from their website, and at the end of the installation, gave me an error and didn't install.<br />Contacted the manufacturer, and after a couple of days sent me a PDF with explanations on how to register the product.<br />After a few more emails, got the link to the download (that I already had used) with the same results.<br />Returned it and bought a Spyder4Pro.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a family movie that shows you how you should reach out to those in need and be there for them.  It's about a white family that goes above and beyond their duty to help a black boy and how it changes all their lives.  It is very enjoyable.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|I know the headline sounds lukewarm, but hardly any movies hold my interest.  As many others have written, &#34;Unknown&#34; begins with botanist Martin Harris arriving in Berlin for a conference which is going to be attended by the world's most famous frankenfood brains.  He is caught in a car accident, almost dies, and when he wakes from a coma, 4 days later, someone has stolen his identity.  The plot proceeds from there, with things getting worse and worse for poor Martin, who has no idea what's happening around him.  In the usual way of such stories, he hooks up (in the old sense, not the new) with the cab driver who saved his life and tries to find out what happened, bodies pile up, car chases and foot chases abound.<br /><br />I really enjoyed &#34;Unknown,&#34; and only when it ended realized that there were some gaping holes in the plot.  That diminishes my enjoyment retrospectively.  I like movies to make sense.  Also, I am tired of the custom of filming movies that happen either in a dingy place or a winter place with a green gray overlay.  Finally, although I love Liam Neeson, I could do without his &#34;gruff&#34; voice.<br /><br />Still, it was enjoyable while I was watching it.
B005F3XV62|5.0|This movie is a great family movie about a zookeeper that discovers that the animals in the zoo can talk.  The animals help him realize what is really important and what he really wants out of life.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book is the Truth. It will give you your life back - though, as you will see, it was there all along.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I learned a lot about life from reading about these two dying lovers.  I'm not sad after reading.  I feel alive.  The characters were wonderful and I wanted to be there with them.  I was there with them.  What a wonderful love story wrought with death and pain that brings depth, warmth and life to its pages.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It's not often that a book about Nazi Germany can be described as beautiful but this book is very beautiful. It hurts to read sometimes but it never left me feeling desolate & hopeless. It took a bit to fall into the rhythm of the words but after awhile it seemed natural.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Has all kinds of settings from doing math to disable the alarm to being in your car.  This alarm had saved me tons of times.  Any customization to an alarm clock you'd ever need
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|Great entertainment!! I had 2 parts on the DVD that I had to skip over due to problems with the DVD quality. also arrived 2 days after the sellers date, may have been due to other problems and not the sellers fault.<br />I would recommend Downton Abbey to everyone! I'm sorry i have gotten such a late start!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Of course, this series has been verified excellent by numerous awards, and I can only add my review of exceptional writing and acting. The DVD arrived promptly, and was in perfect condition.
B00AH6CYRO|1.0|I used to be a big fan as a kid in the later 80's... 90s came and I still tried to listen and find a way to accept their music but could not do it...I built my love of metal around other bands instead...Now that 2000s and 2010s are here I cannot stand Metallica new or old any more, there are so many more bands out there with heavier, more technical, better sounding, with more well thought out music that are and have been around for a while. (does Metallica's cover art represent that their music has been dead for a while...maybe they are just now realizing this). If you are a metallica fan then buy this if you are a metal fan then do some research and spend your hard earned money on some other harder working(than metallica) band that is new, or that have been around as long as these frauds. I hope that this review saves you your time, money and frustration. F.U. metallica and just change your name(putallica, sadallica might be fitting). I'll still buy an exodus, sodom, or even slayer album... styles have changed, but are still ripping it up unrelenting.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Purchased this movie for my soon-to-be 5 year old daughter as an early birthday present. We've owned this since the end of September and she was absolutely ecstatic to see this as one of her gifts.<br /><br />I purchased the Blu-Ray/DVD/DigitalCopy set. A couple of reasons why I did this: (1) You just can't beat the quality of picture that Blu-Ray has to offer and this of course did not disappoint. (2) The fact that a DVD was offered in the combo is in my opinion great. If my daughter wanted to take this movie to a grandparent or friend's house and they don't have a blu-ray player then it would not be an issue because of the DVD disc. (3) The digital copy is more of a favorite for me because it's on the computer and also on my iPad, making it a wonderful thing to have when we have long car rides. (4) Last but not least, I bought the combo set because of the price for all three different formats. It was definitely well priced.<br /><br />My only issue was that the digital copy is downloaded from a third-party site therefore when I uploaded the movie to my iPad it was located in home videos instead of movies on the Videos app. This, of course, is no reason for me to bump any stars off. Another thing about the digital copy is that although it's still of great quality, it's 720p as opposed to 1080p. Not a big issue at all, just some minor notes that I know I paid attention to.<br /><br />Overall it's a wonderful movie for the entire family! My Little Pony never fails to have catchy music and this movie is no exception. It's a great addition to the MLP seasons and definitely ties in well with the tv show. (Some shows have a spin-off movie that doesn't really follow the rest of the show)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to any MLP fan!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I enjoyed this one though not as much as the 2nd book. I'm glad to have it in my library though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game . U can compete with your friends on face book. Gives you challenges . I,like it more than bejeweled.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The original and I suppose the best, but who can say?  Seasons and Star Wars are great, too.  Space and Rio, not so much - but I'm losing the thread.  This game is just fantastic.  Not buying stock in Rovio, but I do love this game.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It is the best alarm I ever had. It is amazingly awesomely fantastically fantastic. You will never get anything like this.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I know Rovio went public and has to make a buck, but all this nonsense about buying characters for certain uses or &#34;permanently&#34; is not for me.  Angry Birds functions best without power ups and gimmicks this.  All I want is great puzzles with exactly the number and type of birds.<br /><br />On the plus side, the powers, levels, characters, and play as the Pork Side are great!  Better than ever, in fact.  So five stars for the usual Angry Birds greatness, minus a star for obvious greed.
B003G4W49C|4.0|very good! I absolutely loved this book!<br />Ender is such a wonderful,dynamic character and it is nearly impossible NOT to sympathize with him.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Have this app on all 3 of my kindles be aware it is VERY ADDICTING. think I play it more than my 4yr old.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Very good on my kindle fire! Difficult at times but good exercise for the brain. Might consider purchasing the full version.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so happy this game finally became available for the Kindle Fire. It's fun & challenging with the all the different levels.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is extremely easy to operate, and I can save a variety of times for various events that happen regularly. This alarm is one of the functions I use most often on my Kindle Fire - I use it almost daily.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I have only watched the first three episodes of Season One. It is great television in the mold of The Sopranos and The Wire. The writing is superb and intelligent viewers will appreciate the sly humor. Can't wait to discover what all the hype has been about.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Written in the first person, this is a story of an Asperger's individual, trying like crazy to find himself a wife.  I rarely laugh out loud, but the author has what seems to be an excellent understanding of the problem and takes the quirkiness all in stride, finding humor in the crazy situations that arise for someone so driven to organize life to the fullest.  Ever since we've read the book, my husband keeps identifying other people who may have Asperger's.  For those of you who are Doc Martin fans on TV, you'll gain a new understanding of the doc.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I did not like this book as well as his first two novels---it was hard to follow at times. Nevertheless, it was an interesting story.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Gladwell usually amazes me; in this book however, he just is good enough. Interesting stories are what keep the glue together here but the &#34;theory&#34; that ties it all together it a little weak his time. Worth reading but not amazing.
B00B84652O|4.0|I hesitated to write a review about this product and mind you, it is not King Diamond, that I am disappointed with, it is Roadrunner Records.  First and foremost, any King Diamond Fan knows that there was one last album for Roadrunner before they parted company, even if it was a Live one.  That does not make \\"The Complete Roadrunner Years\\" complete!!!  The cd's themselves are great, to hear the albums as they were released at the time with no bonus tracks.  I just feel bonus tracks should be placed on an album all on their own.  Now we get to the cd sleeves: the cover art is beautiful!  However, when turned over, instead of getting the original artwork, we get the remaster series back covers which were really quite bad, in my opinion.  I was hoping that they would stay true to the original covers, but that is why I hesitate to \\"hope\\"; it is just another word for apprehension.  With all of that said, I \\"hope\\" the Japanese pick up on these albums, and do right by them.  The original sleeves, inner disc jackets with the lyrics, photos, etc. that they originally appeared on the market with.  If you are not interested in the Live album, original artwork for both cover and inner sleeves, then this is a must have for King Diamond fans.  The sound on these seem to be the re-mastered versions of them because they do sound great!  Overall, it is an absolutely great price for what you get.  I would have paid extra for the things mentioned that did not come with this \\"not\\" complete collection.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase as I buy all versions of King's music as well as Mercyful Fate's.  Satanic Regards to all of you Diamondbangers out there!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I said I would not get addicted, but I did.  I spend time playing when I'm bored or sitting at the airport.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so much it is fast paced its like minion run but 5 stars better.The only thing I don't like about it is it it is hard to  to get charecters thats the only thing. Sometimes it is to easy but that's good because I get like 800 coins in a run.It has some weird charecters.This game has coins you can buy like I got 12300 for just 0.99 cents. This game does not have lots of surfing and you only get a certain number of boards. I like the halloween theme set and mima. I love the game buy it now from the app store.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books of the series but I am not sure if I feel the same way about Allegiant. I understand the concept behind the story, but I guess not really a fan of the way things ended for the main characters. Maybe I'm just a sucker for happier endings, but this ending left me feeling depressed. However you should definitely read it to get closure on the concept of the factions and what purpose the whole thing had to the greater world.
B00CDTSQZW|3.0|The price on this collection fluctuates between 29.99 and 44.99 everyday. Seriously was gonna order this past week and the price changes every other day- for 10/27/13 the price was 29.99 - today 10/28/13 -its 44.99. I am not sure whats going on, but I am not happy that I was gonna buy it last night and now the price is 15 bucks higher! Target.com still has it for  29.99..
B005COO1X6|4.0|Yet another creepy vehicle that doesn't like people unless fresh eating. Now I will be even more leery of a car stopped on the side of the road that looks in trouble or abandoned. Leave it to King to scare the pants off you every time with real world scenarios.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I got this for my 9 year old because I was so sick of MineCraft.  I give this 5 stars because it makes her use her brain.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If your looking for non stop fun play angry birds it's super addicting and great for kids and it's for free! So overall you should download it today.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.it is so fun. I can not get off of it.if u dont have this game u should get it there more than 300 levels im on level 21
B00C2UUB9Q|4.0|Provided a great insight on the birth of the home pc and a glimpse into a logical thinking mind of an accomplished engineer.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Graphically and literally this is a solid piece of story telling.  Will Smith's portrayal of a father's love is timeless for all parents must at some point stand aside and just watch as their children struggle.  The movie portrays a father and son struggling to survive by finding a way and the will to cooperate with each other.  Shyamalan pulls it all together with his inventive set pieces and beautiful cinematography.  Well worth the investment of time and cash.
B000GY729M|4.0|This is a good Killers release, some of their newer stuff I just can't believe it's the Killers. Some of the songs on this CD are really good, some are average.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Captivating, naughty, raunchy, fascinating. A guilty pleasure for sure. I don't think I really knew that this really existed. Pretty great book!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|This CD is really good, better than all their past releases and it rocks from beginning to end. I've been a fan from the start and after Myles CD with Slash I really think he has come into it and the rest of the band sounds tighter! My one issue with Myles has been resolved and I think it is three times better. The lead singer has slowed down his lyrics a little bit, and you can hear everything he is saying and even sing along a little bit. The band as a whole sounds great, and if you compare how he sings on this album to some of his older stuff you will see what I mean. I think he has a great voice but his tweaking has made it all that much better!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love this little collection of the Harry potter movies. So reasonably priced and put together nicely. The books are still better but the movies are great too.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|After many listens I really can not get enough, it does get better the more you listen to it! I think this band is great and this album is just a continuation of their great music. I think it sounds closer to some of their earlier stuff as opposed to there last couple releases. If you are thinking about getting it do it!
B0054JELTI|5.0|Hilarious. I love when all the fairy tale creators invade Shreks house and when the gingerbread man gets interrogated. Could not stop laughing!
B008YZXYY2|4.0|I picked this up by recommendation, and was surprised how good it was in comparison to Stone Sours' first CD. It's pretty heavy and has a good sound to it and there are lot's of good songs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Reading the preview I thought it started out to be a cute, light story of a young girl.  But this is the most disgusting book I have ever read.  I read some of it and then deleted the rest !!
B00G32TD98|5.0|It seems like it's been a long time since a good horror movie has been released. I thought this a great improvement on what they have been calling horror movies. The movie was done very well and actually scares you and makes you jump once in a while. I really enjoyed it and the timing of the release was perfect for Halloween.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|The cd was great. love everyone of the song. Elton john did a great job on recorded thus cd diving board
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This book was a good story and you will enjoy it. There are several twists and turns that you won't expect.
B000GWE44U|5.0|One of the best movies ever in my opinion. Super fast shipping everyone who enjoys watching dvds should have this in their collection
0446699616|5.0|This is first time I read the book of Nelson DeMille.<br />The Panther start with the chapter of the his activity in how he killed the tourist in  a climatic events to show how cruel he is!<br />And then the story continue in a very nice way in telling  all the details of the requirements for John Corey and Kate Mayfield to know about the country,jihads and many other  activities .<br />This is the most interesting parts of Nelson DeMille writings!<br />He does not tell directly the story without knowing all the details of the events surounding it!<br />And this is the most interesting part of the book!<br />He really knows what he is going to tell the reader!<br />He covers every detail of what John Corey faced and saw in the events!<br />Reading the Panther makes you understand clearly how complicated to find The Panther in a country which he is considered the most prominent person!<br />I am longing to read furher othyer Nelson DeMille books,perhaps I will start with The Lion next!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Works wonder wonderfully.  My fingers are sometimes to large to hit the right letter or game figure, but the stylus gives me a &#34;small<br />finger&#34;/
B001EBWITA|5.0|Great movie! Suspenseful, not scary. I would watch it again today.  I thought all of the acting was very good.
B00E00RB5I|5.0|absolutly love this cd. Sound like EWF from the 70's. Dance floor is the jam! Buy this you will be happy.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|If you liked 24, watch this pilot. You won't be disappointed. I will be watching the rest of the seasons
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I recommend this to any one that has plenty of time on their hands.  This game is affecting and way too fun.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Great show. It really captures the contrasts and similarities of the symbiotic relationships of upstairs and downstairs. Watching the series makes me want to be living in those times, upstairs of course!
B008M721MS|3.0|not so bad, actually, but not too good either, just average. is not intuitive at all, but somewhat spectacularly vague.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|All in all this was a really good zombie movie. The story line is almost believable, even though it is a zombie move. If you view it with an open mind and let go of the reality of real life. Just check it out!
B00FF8OKJE|2.0|Fun game, been trying to update all day.  Hopefully everything isn't on fire when the update goes through.  Very frustrating.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Even though this movie has been out for a long time. It still holds up as one of the best movies out there. That is just my opinion.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I and my family really liked the first part of Crawford in spite of it's being so sad.We were pleased that it had very few bad words and few low dresses (just one or two where the neck line was a tad to low and one scene where the maid lay down inapropriatly) The second one was more interesting for us, fewer deaths of the people you liked, and even fewer bad words and kess inapropriat behavier.This part is a  SPOILER  for a small side part: we were disappointed however that they made Mary a bit of a feminism by braking off her engagement as an impediment  for her becoming a great authoress. But since she is not in the movie much and by the time you find out her choice you already care more for Peggy it is not to big of a deal.<br /> Modesty wise there is one part that is a little uncomfortable because of the way a man looks at a girl when he is asking if he might wipe the crumbs off of her skirt and the way he does it is very slow but that is all. tjere was on sort glimps of an inmodest picture in the third episod and in one episode Mary's stepmother is wearing an inmodest dress.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|Even though this movie has been out for a long time. It still holds up as one of the best movies out there. That is just my opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! I've been playing it for a while on my phone and I'm so happy it's finally available on the kindle fire!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great graphics and game play. It is a great game experience. I recommend it and give it five stars. Enjoy it
B005VPRETE|5.0|We bought these for my seven year old daughter and she LOVED it! She was so diligent putting this together and she didn't even need help. We ending up putting all of the pieces in a freezer plastic bag when she was done.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Forgot how much I enjoyed this movie as a child. Definitely worth watching again. I also forgot how inappropriate it might have been for me to have watched this movie as a child.
B003IEJZUG|1.0|I didn't much care for the dialect of the book - it is quite wordy and not that concise. That being said I mainly read non-fiction.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Breeze through some levels, think your way through some levels, declare war while ranting &quot;When I get through this level I will NEVER play Candy Crush again&quot;!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I had to force myself to keep reading this one. It felt a bit disjointed throughout the book making it difficult to really connect with the characters.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I don't understand what the fuss is all about.  I am now on book 4, and I have had no problems loading, reading, and finding my place.  The \\"go to\\" function on my Kindle Fire HD makes it very easy to toggle back and forth if I want to see where I am in the book, or if I want to flip ahead to another chapter on the same character, and the \\"X-ray\\" function allows me to find chapters and pages that reference a specific character.  When I am done reading for a time, I simply shut off the reader, then when I want to resume reading, it goes right to where I left off.  This was my first e-book, and I love the ease of it.
B00G32OER4|3.0|I love a good scary movie and I had really high hopes about this one.  It started off well enough, a bit laggy in the beginning, but quickly picked up speed.  I was genuinely anxious (eyes wide, heart pounding) throughout most of this film, however, the ending is horrible.  It completely ruined the movie for me.  It was rather cheesy and it felt forced. It's good for a few scares, but it was a let down, to say the least.
B000ADWDF2|5.0|Very moving film takes seemingly familiar elements (two brothers in love with the same woman, a Cain and Abel set up) and makes it complicated, disturbing and sad.  Abetted by excellent performances all around, this Danish film tells the story of a woman whose husband goes off to the Afghanistan War and is presumed dead.  Alone, she bonds with her late husband's previously ‘bad’ brother who tries to step up for her and her children -- only to have the 'dead' brother return home a deeply damaged man.<br /><br /> As in “Things We Lost In the Fire” Bier shows a knack for setting us up to assume we know the roads the story will tread, only to takes us somewhere richer and more deeply human.  There are flaws, but any film that quietly packs this kind of emotional punch about the damage that war does, and the deep messy-ness of families deserves to be seen.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Read the directions, but had a problem playing the game since I didn't know what I was doing.  Hopefully I will catch on soon.
B007UXTG8M|2.0|I don't think that this movie has earned all the praise that it has gotten. And in the end there was really never any resolution to the main characters problems. Which makes me feel like  &#34;what are we watching for&#34; if there is no end to the madness. The only thing I loved was the prolonged view of Michael Fassbender's, well you know. And he should really gain some weight not used to seeing a Hollywood it boy soo thin, it's really a turn off.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Ordered this for our daughter as a gift on her wedding day to share with her new husband. He had told her that the love story in UP! portrayed more about love in 8 minutes than most 2-hour movies. She surprised him with some UP!-themed touches on their wedding day and this movie. They took on their honeymoon and watched on one rainy day. Perfect gift for newlyweds deeply in love.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have read the entire series and from the moment I finish one I can't wait for the next one to come out. You will fall in love with the characters, especially Gideon and Eva. Very well written.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a very fun game. Me and my kids enjoyed this game very much, would recommend this game to anyone!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have read the entire series and from the moment I finish one I can't wait for the next one to come out. You will fall in love with the characters, especially Gideon and Eva. Very well written.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a very fun game. My kids and I enjoyed this game very much, would recommend to anyone!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This story was great. I loved the characters and could not put it down. Very well written. I definatly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally ---I can play on Kindle ...LOVE IT !!<br />wish more people would do ..need help with levels but its fun
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read the entire series and from the moment I finish one I can't wait for the next one to come out. You will fall in love with the characters, especially Gideon and Eva. Very well written.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you are not a fan of fawning reviews, keep moving. Stephan King has once again told us, once again, in no uncertain terms, why he is the master. While admittedly not as scary as The Shining, King does a masterful job of giving us what we, the constant readers, want. What happens to our favorite characters after their stories end. I loved seeing the grown up Danny Torrance. I loved how everything's a wheel and he has become the teacher. I love how I can't see mundane things any more (RVs) without wondering..... Add it to the collection!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Was a good overall time passer. Great graphics and a good weapon selection good overall game and great buy thanks
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game plays well no troubles. Been playing non stop for days already beat it. Gonna start over and do it again. Highly recommended
B0035LJY6C|4.0|A fun movie for anyone looking for spooky family humor. Graphics didn't look cheesy despite all the years that have passed!
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the ending. The book kept me interested though till the end. All in all I liked it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment. In retrospect I probably should have guessed the series would continue to go downhill - I loved Divergent, Insurgent was meh, but it's rare for me not to see a series through to the end so I went for Allegiant. Unfortunately, the whole book was boring and repetitive and lacked any depth or character development. The constant switching between POV for Tris and Tobias drove me crazy because it was so poorly executed and their voices read exactly the same. The great \\"revelation\\" of the origins of the city/factions was predictable and trite. This book would have been a turd even without the terrible ending, which was a total cop-out, but that ending put it over the top. I don't mind endings that don't go the way you want them to if they have a point or make a statement, but this didn't. It was gratuitous and did nothing to further the plot (what little plot this book had) and left the book floundering through it's final few pages that were somehow even more painful, tedious, and pointless than the rest.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is far better then origin of symmetry. I love very single song in this album. Every single one. It is very melodic. Plus the best guitar and bass!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game, although I have a few problems when playing the paddock game and mixing the feeds. Other than that, it's an awesome game!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Next stop cheat codes. Maybe a way to get to get to  of the waiting period for new lives? Lol
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoy this show. Its funny and some serious stuff. All of the characters are perfect for their parts. There is no swearing and no violence in it I would recommend it to everyone.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This \\"New dictionary\\" doesn't tell you the definition.<br />I don't like this because it doesn't  tells you any kinds of definitions of any kind of  word.<br />I  wouldn't rate this to any body.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I am a puddle of feelings on the couch right now. And it's all Scalzi's fault. There was laughing, sure, but there was also some crying. It was supposed to be a satire, dammit. Where did these feelings come from? Maybe it's because he knows just how to take the premise seriously enough and still take the piss.<br /><br />The book wasn't quite what I expected--it went above and beyond. I expected a satire, an okay read but not a splendid one. I wasn't expecting fourth-wall breaking or things that made me question my ethics as a writer. I'm not a Trekkie, but I know my way around the Trek quite well. The book got to the heart of things that bother me, and it went beyond everything I've seen a fourth-wall book ever do.<br /><br />Okay, so the novel isn't utterly perfect. It's sometimes hard to tell the characters apart because he never describes their physical appearance--intentional, maybe. And there are times when it got heavy on exposition.<br /><br />I really, really don't care. This is one of the best sci fi novels I have read, one of the best novels I've ever read, and I'm pretty sure anyone who left it a one-star is soulless. I hope you read this, Scalzi, or that one of your people sees this. Thanks for writing something awesome. I'm just going to sit here and rock and back and forth quietly, and hope I can write something as impactful and as good some day.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Prompts to 'save a copy' for or with annotations with every action. Whether one chooses 'yes' or 'no', annotations and highlights are either not retained or do not show. I can't tell, because there is no help file. 'Save as' will not permit me to rename the file, even though it is underscored and shows a cursor which can be moved. The virtual keypad does not appear, and my bluetooth keyboard is not functional in that context. Also, the app crashes repeatedly. I need this in order to do work, and have no time for this nonsense.<br /><br />Save your money. I blew 399 of my Amazon coins on this waste of my time.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Loving this game.  So easy to play and not a penny of my own money spent.  If a simple picture search game is what you are after then this should be everyone's first choice.
B001BANK32|5.0|I know this book is old, but I have never read it.  Since I am running out of Stephen King books to read, I decided to read this one that I have apparently never read!  I am about 69% through and I can't put it down.  One of his best writings!  I would highly recommend reading this one!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We use TWC to plan short and long trips, for scheduling yard work or just a round of golf.  It has become a much used much trusted tool for our busy lives.  We have tried other weather sites, this is hands down the best.  It doesnt drain my battery anymore than playing a game of solitare.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I expected something more like Roku when I ordered this - so I think my expectations were a bit high.<br />This does not have a control - but relies on you to have a laptop, iPad or phone that 'throws' its content onto the TV.<br />I've used it a few times - and when I've had to pause a movie, I've lost the connection and had to start all over.  Not sure if this is me or the system, but I've gone back to Roku for Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. and only use this for presentations or content not available via Roku.  I'm sure this will improve in the future - for for now I'm not all that impressed.  Com'on Google - you can do better!
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This is the  most awesome thing I have ever seen that is on my kindle l like I was looking through my books and I saw the dictionary and I was like cool :) <3and this dictionary is also really good on the go but the only thing that would be better is that if they let you choose a word instead of having to flip every page to look for one word
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the unusual structure of the novel.  The character development was very good.  I did guess the ending very early though.  I would read more books by the author.
1583334386|5.0|Surpassed my expectations in all ways, from content to formating very interesting view point and thought provoking. Highly recommend this to everyone!
B004OZNS2E|5.0|Older movie, but really enjoyable for the geeks among us.<br />Some heady bits (pun intended), maybe some religious undertones toward the climax.<br />Loved the movie since I first saw it in the 80's.
B00G32TD98|5.0|soooo scary!!! very well put together, amazing acting it was all around great no complaints at all, its a must see
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this thing. It does a fantastic job of streaming content to my TV--a clear picture, and very rarely any need to buffer during the middle of a show/movie. (My internet maxes out at about 2.5GB, so faster connections probably work even better.) The Chrome plug in and YouTube app don't work quite as well as Netflix or Hulu, but I have had no reason to complain. I haven't watched regular TV since I got this.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Good movie if you are a Star Trek fan. You should now a little about the characters first to appreciate it.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is one of the best books on the market!  Loaded with valuable information about healing your brain and keeping you healthy.  Must read!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The first two books were riveting could<br />Not put them down, this book was good but lacking the thrill of the first two books, and who kills off the hero of the story, not cool!!!
B000OCXIDK|4.0|I chose this book because I had seen the excellent movie with Colin Firth and Scarlett Johanssen.<br />The story revolves around a young serving girl in an artist's household in the age of the great masters in Holland. The historical era is so different, the mores, the daily way of life, the economics, are all revealed within a fascinating story.<br />I wish all history lessons could be written in such a compelling structure!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love love love loooooooove this game I'm so happy that they got it for my kindle fire thank you amazon.
0316228532|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend. i'm waiting for her to finish it so I can read it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A version for Kindle.  I have been waiting forever for this.  I just couldn't keep playing on my small phone screen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it all hands down you should totally get it. great app just very amazing worth every penny. bye
B001BWDG0W|5.0|I loved the movie and I enjoy the soundtrack.  But then again, who doesn't like ABBA?  Well maybe the younger folks that grew up in the 80s I guess, but hey, this music was cool too.
B00BMNM4H6|1.0|People, stop making/buying apps like these! This is a free game on sites like Kongregate! No money needed! Believe me, this is a ripoff!
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Guess the Emoji is a great game for kids to play.Even adults can play along with there kids or buy them selves.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I thought this was a well made game with nice graphics but I found the timer seriously annoying less than halfway through.  There's no option for an untimed mode, which I really prefer.  If you like racing against a pretty strict clock when you play games, then consider this a 4 star review instead of 3.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults. I get all the kids movies for the grandkids to watch here but we love them too.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Full of features!<br />Make a new alarm for each day of the week, each with a different sound<br />Have the alarm start softly & increase in volume<br />Has a customizable snooze alarm<br />It has a stop watch<br />Includes a timer<br />Allows you to customize the color & look of the screen, use 12 & 24 hr formatting but...<br />BEST OF ALL It has NEVER FAILED ONCE!
B004JRVQX0|1.0|These people are geniuses. They were able to woo a large company into bed and create the most annoying child ever. It's poor quality and breaks easily. I have a first generation dongle and Just downloaded PT 11. I was super stoked to get on and get going when I learn that technology in this area has advanced so far that this license can't be encoded on my primitive old dongle. I must now fork out another $50 to buy the far superior one that will be able to handle my license much better than my still perfectly functional old one... Geniuses..<br /><br />Well at least I'm not a poor college student that would be awful..<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />Ben Dover
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have to give this one 5 stars. While this book was not what I expected, it was a perfect ending to the trilogy.
6305137293|5.0|This version was superior in every way superior to that piece of crap Rob Zombie made! And he showed such promise with his First Halloween remake, and then it went all bad! If you want to see a really good follow-up to a Horror Classic watch this version of Halloween II. There are some drawbacks however: The body count is higher, (John Carpenter was able to scare the Sh#t out of audiences with having Michael Myers kill only 5 people, scared the be-Jesus out of America with a body count of 5. So has it is with sequels the body count is higher as well as the way some of the victims were killed, in the first one Mike was a psychopath, in this sequel he was an artist. With new and imaginative ways to kill his victims; and it had an ending that should have ended the series, but there was too much money to be made so they made him indestructible like Jason or Freddy. Boo.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Every runner or rather every person should read this. Agendas aside it's a fantastic book. Don't think about it, just read it.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Just like the previous seven seasons, an entertaining series. Mystery, romance, yuckiness,education shown in a great format.  Actors are great, believable in their parts. Always wondering about romantic partnerships - when, where, who, etc.  Start from season one if you haven't seen it.  A lot has happened.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|Not too bad. Food entertaient.  Will watch it again someday.  Has a little comedy flare to it.  Definitely food entertaient.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|It was great!!! It kept me at the edge of my seat. I could not put it down. I was sad when I finished. I do recommend it.
006202406X|5.0|Wow Veronica Roth delivered an amazing conclusion to one of my top favorite series. I really loved Allegiant and I just can't stop thinking about it! It left me speechless.<br /><br />Allegiant picks up briefly after where Insurgent left off. The faction system is crumbling and Tris is given the chance to go outside the fence. Roth has done an excellent job with developing these characters through the course of this series. Tris is definitely on my list of top protagonists. I like that she has been affected by everything she has seen and lived through because it makes her more realistic. She is this strong girl, but she still has her flaws and weaknesses. I also felt that I really understood her motives and decisions in this book.<br /><br />Then I loved that Allegiant was also told in Tobias' point of view. He is another character who has come so far since Divergent and has been developed really well. I loved that reading his point of view gave me some new insight into his mind and motives. I also really loved how the relationship has grown between Tris and Tobias. Then I loved getting to see the return of some of my favorite characters, like Christina, and getting to meet some new characters as well.<br /><br />From the moment I started this book, I couldn't put it down. I was completely captivated from the beginning to the end. The plot had action, romance, and twists that I didn't expect. The alternating point of views flowed really well and made the story move along more quickly. I also loved learning even more about this world and seeing what was outside the fence. All of my questions were definitely answered. Then I have to say that in this book especially, Roth's writing was beautiful. There were so many times that I would pause to write down a quote.<br /><br />Overall I loved Allegiant! It made me smile, laugh, and cry a lot. I plan on rereading this series over and over again very soon. I certainly won't be able to forget this world and the characters that Roth created.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Strong enough magnet to hold on to chargers with no worry of falling off. Also great that the price on this is not jacked up through the roof which I appreciate.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|It's hard to believe we were so captivated by a movie with hardly any dialogue.  These babies from all over the world are beautiful and funny.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Excellent. Well written. Gripping plot. Engaging characters. This book has a great mix of action and dialogue and is informative without being too technical.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I had seen the movie before, so I knew that I wanted it in my collection of DVDs.  I'm enjoying getting to know this younger cast of characters in this movie.  And I look forward to more Star Trek movies starring this cast.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King is returning to the top of his writing form. Doctor Sleep is the perfect sequel to the Shining. One plot twist is totally unforeseen. This is a must read and must collect for Stephen King fans.
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first two books and was so excited for the 3rd and final book and not to mention the upcoming movie. Now that I read this book I don't think that I even want to see the movie - what is the point? Maybe Hollywood will make a better ending to this book if the movies make it that far. I understand that the author can really do anything that she wants with the story but I kinda want my money back.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|A very gritty and real story of domestic abuse, it's effects and the healing afterwards. If you are looking for a fluffy read this is not the story, but if you want a deep and gritty story then check this out.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|This movie is a generational favorite. The kids and I watch a few times a month, at least. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommended it.
B008JFUPZI|3.0|\\"You gonna sit there and mope or do you want to help me stop the, you know, an apocalypse?\\" After things go very very wrong while out on a bust Boston PD officer Nick (Reynolds) is killed but before he heads to his judgement he is swept into an office and offered a new job. He is now a member of the R.I.P.D. and along with his new partner Roy (Bridges) they set out to capture the Dead-O's that roam free. When Nick finds a connection between the Dead-O's and his death things turn personal. I have to start off by saying that I wasn't really expecting this to be good at all. I'm not sure why but when I say the preview I immediately expected another Men In Black and didn't think it was needed. While I won't say this wasn't Men In Black like, it was much better then I expected and did laugh and was entertained most of the way through. This is very much geared toward a young teen crowd but I still found it funny. I do have to say though that without Reynolds and Bridges this may have been unwatchable. I did like it and am glad I saw it but this isn't something I'd watch again, but keep in mind I expected this to be as bad as all the reviews it got. A combination of Men In Black with a dash of Howard The Duck thrown in. Watchable but really only once. Overall, not even close to as bad as the reviews made it seem, watch it and make up your own mind. I give it a B.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this story, Uncle Stevie did gooood by his fans, want Abra's story now please.<br />also everyone should read Joe Hill's books, also awesome, I am just a big old fan of both of these guys, entertaining and mind blowing scary.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of Victor Hugo and/or \\"Les Miserables\\" and I must say that performances to date have left me flat especially in comparison to creations such as \\"Cavalleria Rusticana\\" by Pietro Mascagni.  I did, however, spend a few shekels to watch the latest cinematic version from Tom Hooper.  OMG!!!  Genius, Tom.  Pure GENIUS!<br /><br />I immediately ordered the DVD from Amazon just to re-watch Anne Hathaway perform \\"Dream,\\" which I predict will become an essential addition to precious moments in cinematic history.  This cast has made me re-evaluate Hugo and \\"Les Miserables,\\" and to finally see what I have been missing.  Miss Hathaway's one glance downward and to her left, in abject misery, made me swoon and I don't swoon.  Those of you who have seen this film know the exact moment of which I speak.  Her voice is unique in a sea of voices and her range (working hard on the low notes) is stupendous.<br /><br />Russell Crowe singing?  Russell Crowe was Russell Crowe as in every one of his performances: PERFECT.  His rough, imperfect voice is what we should expect from a life-long cop, but his imperious, murderous glance froze me with fear as only Russell Crowe's deeply sparkling eyes, full of hatred, can.  Even in his lesser roles he commands attention, but he usually turns in a performance that is LARGER THAN LIFE.  In Les Miserables he proves that he can and does everything!<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is huge-o (forgive me) as Valjean.  Absolutely the pitiful protagonist that I never liked.  I am converted to a compulsive fan.  Amanda Seyfried has the sweet innocence of an angel with a voice to match.<br /><br />I was surprised and enjoyably fascinated by Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter who scored bulls-eyes as they usually do.<br /><br />Congratulations to all.  You converted a sinner.  Anne Hathaway, will you marry me?

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Everything's absolutely great about this game. I dnt even mind waiting around to gather up more tries to play, however, I do mind the having to purchase to continue playing, or as an alternative, the having to complete a quest in order to unlock it and waiting a full day to play the next quest. I understand why but still dnt like it
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Although I am not a fan of comic book heroes becoming movies, due to the storyline changing, Iron Man 3 did keep with the flow of the previous movies.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It was so great...<br /><br />I really love this game! Good thing kindle fire have the app now...it is really fun &amp; enjoying! Good game
006202406X|4.0|This is not a kneejerk reaction. I am going to be completely honest. I was torn after I finished the book. I was frustrated with that hard twist but after taking a little time to process it I do appreciate the ending. It is definitely not a 5 star book but it definitely not worthy of all the one and two stars people are kneejerking to.<br /><br />Here is where the SPOILERS come in.<br />1)To all those crying out about there being no happy ending for Tris and Four, war isn't pretty. Roth does her best to show this all throughout the series in various ways. People and lives get torn apart.<br />2) It was completely within Tris's  character to make the sacrifice that she did. I appreciate an author that stays true to the character rather than bending the character to get the happy ending.<br />3)While the switch and style and perspective would have been better if it had been introduced from the beginning of the series, it did help provide needed information in this book and to bring the wind down to the conclusion that it wouldn't have been able to have if it had stuck strictly with Tris's perspective.<br />4)FINALLY and MOST IMPORTANTLY when it comes down to it, I truly did enjoy reading this book. It may not be a masterwork but it entertained me and tugged on emotions in the right ways to keep me wanting to read to the end. The fact that it isn't the fangirly ending some people may have wanted does not make it bad. If it keeps true to the story's characters it is the right ending, and I feel like this was.<br /><br />So to conclude, I am glad I read this series. I would recommend it to a friend. I would go back and re-read to try and pick up on some of the nuances you miss the first time you read a book.

B0002NRQTS|5.0|This is a great album. The songs, the lyrics, the music...all incredible.  \\"Presto\\" is one of my favorite songs. Just amazing. Listen to it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very captivating!  I enjoyed how this book followed on to The Shining so well!  It's been about 20 years since I read The Shining so weaving bits from it into this story helped tie it together.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I bought this book despite the other people's reviews and I am so sad that I did. Imagine your own ending because this book will ruin the whole series for you. I don't think I will be able to read these books the same way. Do not get this book.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|another Stephen King winner. this book is a sequel to the shining, which I loved both the book and the movie.  How Danny's life is affected by all that happened to him as a boy is very interesting, and I love that we got to find out what happened.  It seems like a real life story filled both with tragedy and happiness.  a great read

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really did enjoy book 2 and am excited to start book 3!!!! What a great storyline even though, (can't believe I'm gonna say this), was getting a bit bored with all the sex. Like I said it's a good story!!!

B007EC27QM|2.0|once downloaded, very slow to react when numbers are entered in. The wait time for any functions to perform is extremely slow.
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|The authors say the  rolls are random but if you play long enough and you see the computer player roll doubles with 4 pips left on the board when you have only one to play off you might get a little suspicious.  Happens way to often
B00ADQPB50|3.0|While it is not as good as season 1, it still is an interesting tale with lots of twists and turns.  The characters can make you sympathetic towards them, but if you chose to skip this one it won't be a great loss.  It's good filler between seasons 1 and 2.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The new format is complicated and difficult to use. the old format was straight forward and without all the fancy pictures and advertising.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Tatiana Maslany does a marvelous job portraying the cast of Orphan Black.  Of course there are others in the cast -- Dylan Bruce (Paul - Beth's boyfriend/spy), Jordan Gavaris (Felix the foster brother), Kevin Hanchard (Det. Art Bell, Beth's partner), Michael Mando (Vic - Sarah's boyfriend she abandoned), Maria Doyle Kennedy (Mrs. S the foster mother) and Skyler Wexler (Sarah's daughter) -- The other 5 roles (3 additional others that disappeared/died) are played by Tatiana superbly -- each having a different stance, walk, posture, mannerisms and speech.<br /><br />Orphan Black is about a Sarah Manning, a street smart young woman that walked out on her child 10 months prior that returns home and learns by accident while stealing Beth's identity, there are a group of women that all look exactly like her.  Turns out these women are clones, who have been monitored.  Although these women are all identical, DNA-wise, that is the only thing identical about them.<br /><br />Sarah is a street smart hustler.<br />Allison is a prim and proper, gun toting soccer mom.<br />Cosima is a gay naive science geek.<br />Helena is an psychopath that is killing the clones.<br />Elizabeth (Beth) is a police officer.<br />There is also a professional clone -- or pro-clone as Felix calls her.<br /><br />This first season is about Sarah taking responsibility as well as the group of women learning not only to trust one another but who not to trust.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is a &#34;girly&#34; show, it isn't.  This show will force you to think and it is far from predictable.  The actions of some of the women will be surprising and unexpected as you take this journey with them to learn more about who cloned them and why.<br /><br />Helena's insane behavior reveals some logic to her behavior.  Allison begins to spin out of control as she suspects everyone of being her clone spy.  Cosima makes mistakes because she doesn't understand exactly how naive she is.  Sarah is under pressure from Paul, Vic, Mrs. S., the clones and especially Helena (who has decided not to kill Sarah because she feels a connection to her and when you find out what it is you will say @amn).<br /><br />There is some violence but this season is about putting the puzzle together, learning who is who, hoping someone you've grown attached to doesn't die and understanding the big picture.  Is there some heart-ache?  Yep.  Are there some moments to cheer?  Yep.  Will this show make you say &#34;what the Puck?&#34;  Absolutely -- several times.  Is a good use of your time for entertainment?  Without any doubt, yes.  If you watch, like my brother and I, you will be hooked.  My brother and I went from talking every couple of weeks to talking every week because of Orphan Black, cause you gotta discuss it with somebody.om Paul, Vic, Mrs. S., the clones and especially Helena (who has decided not to kill Sarah because she feels a connection to her and when you find out what it is you will say @amn).<br /><br />There is some violence but this season is about putting the puzzle together, learning who is who, hoping someone you've grown attached to doesn't die and understanding the big picture.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|As an Author, Veronica had an opportunity to be just as much a hero to all her faithful readers as Tris was the hero for so many characters during the first two books. Sadly, Veronica and Tris both ended the series on a serious zero note.<br /><br />Veronica Roth wrote a book how she personally wanted it to play out. Fine.<br />But for the life of me I can't believe this book made it past editors, proofreaders, critiques, etc before going to the final print without someone advising her that a major re-write was highly recommended.<br /><br />Surely some of those people told Veronica the same thing that has been written over and over on these reviews. Obviously the two POV format was NOT her talent as a writer and she either needed to re-write it all in two distinct voices or stick with what she already proved she was great at..writing through the POV of Tris.<br /><br />Unlike the first two books in the series, this book was painfully monotonous, monotone and sadly the only thing it inspired me to do was exercise my right to skim through pages in search of something, anything that sparked a renewed interest in the story.<br /><br />Spoiler Note:<br /><br />Killing off a main character, especially at the end of a series, is risky business for any Author. We understand the characters an Author creates are theirs to do with as they want, but Authors also need to understand their readers have invested not only our money in their books, but also our time and emotions.<br /><br />Readers can ultimately handle or even understand such a sacrifice if there is a VERY good reason for it, but in this case, the words and short term actions building up to the gratuitous shock factor only involved Tris and her brother.<br /><br />We readers are lead into a sacrifice of Tris for a character in the series who, by Veronica's pen, was designed so that we wouldn't particularly care about him.<br /><br />The result of whatever Veronica was hoping to accomplish in conclusion to her books ended up shallow and pointless. What a disappointment...ended up shallow and pointless. What a disappointment...

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a really good read, with an unexpected ending!. Losing Hope, the companion novel, was also very good! Enjoy!
B00BATWJFE|5.0|I've been looking forward to this book since I first heard about, and I am happy to report, that I am not disappointed in any way.  I loved it and didn't want to put it down, but  I didn't race through it as I knew that I wouldn't want it to end.<br /><br /> Don Tillman is a professor of genetics at a university in Australia.  He has a very straight forward approach to life; he has a strict schedule and every thing he undertakes has a specific purpose or goal.  I became obvious to me almost immediately that Don has autism, more specifically Asperger Syndrome, though he doesn't realize  that.  At first, I felt that the narration was a bit stilted and uncomfortable, but quickly realised that it was the character of Don who was so rigid with no emotion to colour his words or activities.<br /><br /> He has reached that point in his life where he wants a wife and is determined to launch a project to find the perfect candidate.  To further this goal, he enlists the aid of his two friends, husband and wife Gene and Claudia.  The project takes a twist when Gene sends Rosie to Don with a genetics question and he mistakes her for a 'wife' candidate.<br /><br /> From the point of their meeting, we get an inside view of the development of their friendship even though Don has dismissed Rosie as a potential mate.  If I were to interview Don and ask him how a person makes friends, he would undoubtedly give me a very specific list of activities and dialogues that would have to occur, but in reality, they seem to develop over time due to repeated associations.  I really can't look back at any of my friendships, and pick that one day where we went from acquaintances to friends.  That is essentially how his relationship with Rosie proceeds.<br /><br /> Don lived a very structured life before he met Rosie, and through out the novel, he had several talks/debates with himself about changing his plans/schedules.  This is very realistic as I have found that I also become set in my ways and that I need to kick start myself and try something new and different every so often.<br /><br /> This is a wonderful presentation of two very different people developing a relationship and how they accommodate each others uniqueness.<br /><br /> I also want to congratulate Mr. Simsion for his use of humour.  This book was funny and had my laughing out loud at parts and credit to the author, that it was always the situations I was laughing and never at the person involved.that I need to kick start myself and try something new and different every so often.<br /><br /> This is a wonderful presentation of two very different people developing a relationship and how they accommodate each others uniqueness.<br /><br /> I also want to congratulate Mr. Simsion for his use of humour.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Danny Torrance all grown up. And, just as one would expect, the adult Dan Torrance arrives with more than his share of baggage from his traumatic youth.  With King as with his sometime coauthor Peter Straub, maturity and years of rich life experiences are ever so present in the development of equally rich characters.  In Doctor Sleep, those theories of both scientific speculation and legend and lore become entirely feasible and all the more horrifying as a result.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Still a fantastic movie, with the a story and characters that will last forever!  David Bowie is great, with his portrayal of the goblin king, and the music he did for the movie.  Jim Henson's world is filled with creativity, and wonder.  The humor is classic, and great for kids to discover their is more to TV then just sponge bob.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|I like most of Will's movies, but this is one of them that will find its way at the top of the list. Without telling you too much about the movie itself, I can say that this movie shows the determination of a black man to make ends meet. Highlighted are his honesty, the struggles of having to be a father to his young son, and the strength he shows during a time when he is left with nothing but his &#34;will to survive&#34;.<br /><br />Anyone at the end of the road should see this movie. It is inspiration at its best! The best way to say &#34;When all else fail, keep trying!&#34;

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|If you like contemporary music, you'll love this CD.  Lana Del Rey aka Lizzie Grant is a very talented contralto singer.  Style and voice reminiscent of Tori Amos, Lana has a unique tonal quality which is uniquely hers.  Many of the songs on this CD are thought provoking if not retrospective with a tinge of longing for something lost or unattainable.  You will not be disappointed with the quality of every song on this CD.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app &#34;bingo blitz&#34; happens to be the best yet.(in my opinion) all the action has been set up well. Yes you can purchase certain items but you can play free every day as well. This app gives you bingo and slots with really cool graphics. They start you out with free bingo bucks to play in a free five round tournament and from there is up to you. This is a fun time by all people around the world. There is chat while playing or you can turn off chat. These games teach you a lot. I recommend this for teens to adult.also the in purchasing can be controlled on Kindle Fire.

B00FFRAKRG|3.0|This album has elements of older korn and elements of newer electronic sounding korn.  Overall there are a few songs that stand out such as prey for me, never never and lullaby for the sadist.  Overall though this album is average and doesn't stand out.  Many songs are average and forgetable.
B004LROUW2|5.0|The story unwinds in a curious rhythm, sometimes with electric and word swallowing pace and sometimes incredibly slow and boring.  Fantastic and very fun to read.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|I LOVED the chapters being from Tris's and Four's points of view. It was hard to follow at first, but by the fourth chapter it was great.<br /><br />As upsetting as the end was, it had to be done. Had she allowed Caleb (who I still think Four should have beaten to a pulp) to continue he wouldn't have had the nerve to go through with it, especially once facing off with David. Not to mention, that was just the type of person Tris was.<br /><br />Kudos to Veronica Roth for doing what should have been done at the end of the Harry Potter Series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and interesting.  Easy to play and is challenging .  Can be frustrating at times.  I would recommend it for anyone.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This is a fascinating movie about four world-class magicians recruited to aid an unknown person on an unknown quest. They pull off some magic that would be mind-blowing if seen live (it's a lot easier with camera angles and special effects). But the interesting part of the story is the ease with which they always stay one step ahead of those pursuing them, the lingering mystery over the true purpose of their magic shows (even they don't know the TRUE purpose) and who their real benefactor is. All is revealed in the surprise ending and it's a good one. The acting is terrific with Jesse Eisenberg reprising his Social Media frown and brainy aura, and Woody Harrelson showing, once gain, why he is rapidly becoming one the the best actors working today. Throw in Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman all skillfully directed in a satisfyingly intricate plot and you get a couple hours of terrific entertainment.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The product was advertised in such a way as to seem to transmit the contents of the computer screen to a nearby television.  While it does do this, it only does it for certain specific, extremely limited applications.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|What a Great read! Kind of sad but thats okay. i Absolutely loved this series. Can't wait for the movies!
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|In Ann Leckie's universe, an ancillary is a a sort of meat puppet -- a mind-wiped (or mind-suppressed?) adult human put into service as an avatar of an artificial intelligence. It's easy to get lost in the early pages of the novel because the book's \\"I\\" shifts back and forth between the AI that runs a ship, a unit of multiple ancillaries that belongs to the ship but runs semi-autonomously, and a single member of that unit. That single unit is the one out for justice, seeking to right a wrong done to it centuries ago.<br /><br />This universe is a grand one in which a large and aggressive human interstellar empire begins developing internal rifts after encountering a much-more-powerful alien race. The scope and a few of the details are reminiscent of Iain Banks' \\"Culture\\" novels, but Leckie's storytelling is more personal, more serious, and less flashy. Her world-building skills are very good; she paints vivid pictures of unfamiliar cultures in conflict. Her refusal to assign gender to (or discuss the biological sex of) the ancillary in question is reminiscent of Delany's similar move in \\"[[ASIN:0819567140 Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand]].\\" Still, Leckie is much more interested in personal identity than in the gender politics and sexuality that were Delaney's focus.<br /><br />Just how much the novel concerns identity and the notion of a unitary self does not become clear until the final third of the book. Does an AI have a self? What about a group of bodies with the same personality implanted in them? Can we meaningfully talk about a single self when it is spread out over tens, dozens, or hundreds of distinct bodies? Assuming such a thing can be done, it's a real problem.<br /><br />That does not mean that readers cannot sit back and enjoy this as a reasonably straightforward space opera centering on a ronin's quest for vengeance against the powerful figure who betrayed the ronin's master. It works just fine as an adventure tale.<br /><br />Bottom line: I was very impressed with \\"Ancillary Justice,\\" and I would expect any fan of the \\"new space opera\\" to be equally wowed. Those with a particular focus on gender politics in sci-fi should also be interested. Highly recommended.s very impressed with \\"Ancillary Justice,\\" and I would expect any fan of the \\"new space opera\\" to be equally wowed.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|The levels start out almost too easy but progressively get harder.  The colors are bright and are fun to move around.  This is definitely a fun brain-challenge game!  I like that you can stay on the game for as many tries as you need to solve it, or move on to another and come back to solve it another time.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Each episode stands on its own as an interesting/exciting story, though over the course of the series, one &#34;gets into the characters&#34; who are well developed over the course of the first season.  Margolies and Noth both deliver excellent performances
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast does exactly what it claims fast and easy. I'm hoping more apps are made available, it works so well. The only drawback is that the Google Chrome Web store is not available on all formats in order to use the add ons and extensions for the Chromecast.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its good app. but come on people if this isn't your kind of game don't buy it these people don't make these apps for our enjoyment this is how they make their living. and I know its free but spend less time on your ipad kindle or what ever you have and get on with your lives.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Kind of corny but entertaining. Something if you like sci-fi. Kids will love it for sure! Thats it for me.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book is entertaining but doesn't have Grisham's usual level of twists and turns. Drags a bit in the last half.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love the album so much I am a bit at a loss as to how to even review it. Sorry people. To sum it up in one sentence would be. Its both soothing and energizing to listen to.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|love the game very additive for all ages the only problem I have is it freezes way to much very frustrating. Makes you not to want to play. if you get this fixed will give a higher rating.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really wanted so much to love this book, but eegad!<br /><br />Normally it would take me one day, or maybe two, to read a book like this, but in this case it took me 5 days. I actually started reading another book before I finished this one, just so I could enjoy part of my day off, but finally (as if it was homework) decided I better just finish Allegiant and get it over with. It really was that painful. The writing bordered on ghastly (why have two POVs that sound the same?? That led me to guess the ending by about chapter 13, because why else would you DO that???), the plot was contrived, and it was chock full of regurgitated, repackaged civil rights moral messages. Really? That's the best VR could come up with?<br /><br />Worse, the characters that I loved, that I watched fumble around without a plan for a good part of Insurgent, again had no clear idea of what they were doing. I think I could have lived with that if they had ultimately conceived something that required more intelligence and ingenuity than a tee-peeing bunch of dumb high school jocks, but alas. Most of the book can basically be summed up as boring, internal dialogue, which was on a continual loop of questioning someone else's or the character's own actions/beliefs, followed by trying to figure out if they could be forgiven/trusted, followed by thinking that something should be done, followed by not knowing what that should be. And then insert some completely ridiculous, hastily-hatched plan that pretty much made no sense and was (for the most part) poorly executed. And really, that's what makes the ending so distasteful, because I felt like there could have been a hundred other more creative, intelligent, ways to arrive there. Did I mind her ultimate fate? No. Not if that were the logical, couldn't-be-any-other-way conclusion, but in this case it just seemed to be there for shock value and a serious deficiency of dexterity on the part of the author. Sad. It's really that complete lack of intelligent story telling that will keep me from EVER reading anything by VR again. I don't waste my time or money on people that do things for shock value alone. Sorry.<br /><br />And I really cannot believe that we never got farther than the airport.
006202406X|1.0|I was so shocked the way Ms. Roth ended Allegiant. Tris' death didn't bring anything to the story that having her survive.  What was the purpose? We already knew that Tris would sacrifice for others, so what was the purpose. It didn't advance any of the others lives.  Even two years later Tobias wasn't happy.  What was it all about?  Ms. Roth played a nasty trick on her readers who were interested how the society would end up.  I didn't see the reason for this Great Sacrifice.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I have been reading Mr. King's work for 30 years or so.  He has had some big misses in his later years for sure.  I thought that Tommyknockers was the first novel of his that I found not as well-written as his earlier works.  While many of his later novels have been hits like The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, more often than not, they've fallen flat for me. The descent into the Gunslinger's world that tied together many of his books just didn't work to keep me interested.<br />  Doctor Sleep, unfortunately, falls into the later year works that are comically bad.  We get it that King was an alcoholic and AA probably was a big part of his life for many years and might still be.  Who wants to read that much about it unless you have to?  The &#34;villians&#34; were so ridiculously named that I just laughed at them.  There was never any sense of danger in the least and the characters were really difficult to relate to or get invested in.  I have to admit I was rooting a bit for Nan and her crew just because Dan Torrance and the rest were so bland.  If you're a big King fan you'll probably read it no matter what I say but if you aren't:  skip this and read Salem's Lot or the original Shining.  I simply cannot recommend this book to anyone as I'm not a mean person.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this every morning, since i have my kindle next to my bed. You can either leave this running or close the app, and the alarm will still work. Multiple sound settings and tones. Definitely didn't waste any money on this purchase! Well worth it!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This puts a wonderful light on our purpose here and what we can have on the other side making our inevitable death a blessing reading the poem at the end makes it all fit along with his account of his journey there and back.  I will definitely recommend this book and it has changed how I look at the world and the energy I project

B00EW79Y0O|4.0|A great coming of age movie that's actually appropriate for the entire family to watch.  This movie helped remind me of the challenges and struggles a teenager faces when dealing with peer pressure, parental expectations, and unmet aspirations.  Very helpful to me as my children enter their teenage years.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I loved how clearly the author illustrates how character plays a major role in accomplishing our goals. Loved it! A most to every parent and person willing to overcome their own limitations.
B00000G3I2|5.0|Though often derided as a generational film (as in High Fidelity by Jack Black's character), being of its generation I still find it enjoyable.  Not deep, nor truly philosophical, it does raise some deep and philosophical questions in passing.  As a character study of the main characters, however, it is well done.  In my view, a classic.
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|I am having the same problem with the last chapter. App keeps force closing on me. The game is great but I have to give it one star till this is fixed.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series, hands down one of the best on TV.  Definitely worth the time to watch it.  Great acting.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game considering its a freebie, good graphics and gameplay experience. No in game requests for cash.  Go and gun away!
B0041C09Y0|5.0|All the biker gangs featured show flawed people that live on the other side of the law and struggle with issues. This series draws in the viewer much more than is good and healthy, probably.
1451695195|1.0|I read this book for a book group discussion and was quite incredulous from the start. I do believe that the phenomena of a near death experience is real to those who have experienced one, but this author's long trip is a fabrication , in my opinion. his professional ethics are in question as well. perhaps, since his professional career is on the downslide he is turning to marketing himself as guru to earn his living.  don't waste your money.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I was very impressed by the graphics in this game. The textures were sumptuous. The puzzles were demanding but not insolvable. A couple of them send me to the clues. I played with it for most of the day and felt a bit disappointed when I reached the end. Hopefully the game designers will add some more levels. At $1.99 it is quite a deal.<br /><br />The Prologue gives the gamer some idea of how the game functions with some easy puzzles.  Each of the next levels is more complex with regard to the graphics and the puzzles.  It is possible to solve some of them by sheer luck, but others require a bit of thought.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a site I use frequently. It can be very entertaining and it allows you to keep in touch with family and friends
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Alexander describes a prolonged near death experience and analyses it from the perspective of a neurologist.  The latter aspect puts a different light on such experiences which I found interesting, but not convincing.  I kept waiting for him to go into more detail on what he learned but he cops out by saying it was beyond human comprehension. I was disappointed as a result.  It reads like fiction and fails as a proof of anything, let alone heaven.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|good lesion, if you determine you can do the best for society and your self, Can definitely enjoy with family and kids can learn out of this movie
B00FEB09VA|3.0|&#34;Unfinished Song&#34; includes four great performances by its lead actors, but I was expecting a bit more camp.  The film is touted as a comedy, but it's more of a predictable redemption story.  Our family enjoyed watching it, but it's not one we'll come back to.  Terence Stamp's Arthur is a cantankerous geezer who doesn't know how to show affection to anyone but his dying wife.  He learns to overcome his loneliness with the aid of the director (Gemma Arterton) of the choir she loved.
0439023513|4.0|I had to write something about this book since everyone seems to be comparing this to  Allegiant which seems to me to be about death count and shock.<br /><br />I will not compare the two.  This book is not the exact happy ending that many had wanted.  My complaint with this book was that it felt rushed and not as flushed out as the first two.  However, every death as horribly sad and shocking it was felt real to me.  I understood the reasoning.  I could see the plot point that each death was trying to make.  I have always loved Katniss and have been a Peeta fan from the beginning.  Not that I hated Gail, just that Peeta was always her representation of hope and survival.  IMO.  After the first Hunger Games, there are just somethings that Gail will not understand the way other winners do.  None of them seem to have come out of the Games unscathed or unscarred.  There is something to that.  I like that Katniss and Peeta still struggle with their \\"issues\\" even years later because that is realistic for individuals that suffer from PTSD.  In conclusion, I liked the book.  Not my favorite of the whole series but still felt congruent with the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting I absolutely love it!!! I highly recommend users to download this app!!! Its great!!!! Cant wait to beat all the levels!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series.  I have hard back  copies of each book and bought this kindle edition for on the go.  I haves read all the books multiple times and still feel the heart ache and sorrow.  I still love the book.  I may not be like Katniss but I feel like Collins helps me understand the character.  From the death of her father to the final \\"Hunger Games\\" in the last book.  Emotionally damaged characters  that find a way to survive the effects of all that happened to them.<br /><br />If like clean happy endings you might now like the way this ends. I happen to like the ending but that is just me.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent story telling , wrapped it with great sensibility . Good read , waiting for next one , hope he writes about constitution law from today's perspective .
B0045LSIRM|5.0|This is a great CD. It is just Bryan accompanied by a piano player. There are no other band members. It is an all acoustic album. I also saw Bryan in concert a few months ago for his Bare Bones tour. If he comes to your town be sure and catch the show.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is finally on the kindle and extremely addictive. The levels get more involved and tougher to beat. Love playing and trying to beat the next level.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have not finished reading this yet. I am about 75% finished. I really like it so far. Tom Clancy is one of my favorite authors. He just recently passed away. I will miss reading new books from him.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Very well written. No lag, no drag, no superfluous research filler. Characters are universal yet ethnically identifiable, clean and unique.
B00D5EWRHW|5.0|When I went to rate the songs in my music app I realized that I had marked each one 4 or 5 stars.  In the indie rock/pop genre, this group of multi-instrumentalists brings passion, vision, and harmonizations that set them apart. See them live if you get the opportunity.

0446615641|5.0|Stone Cold is the 3rd novel in Baldacci's Camel Club series, following 2006's The Collectors. This is not a standalone book; its story begins only days following the close of the previous novel. The events in The Collectors are essential to this book, but it is the slate of events and backstory presented in the first book, The Camel Club, that is critical to understanding this book. Otherwise, the impact of this tale, particularly the ending chapter will be lost on the reader.<br /><br />This book is about revenge. Harry Finn wants revenge against the CIA assassins who murdered his father some 30 years ago and he's killing people to get it. Casino owner Jerry Bagger wants revenge against Annabelle Conroy for conning $40 million from him and he's killing people to get it. Paddy Conroy wants revenge against Jerry Bagger for murdering his wife some 25 years ago and he plans on killing people to get it. And Carter Gray wants revenge against our protagonist, Oliver Stone, for making his life miserable now after recently discovering Oliver survived a CIA assassination attempt some 30 years ago. And he definitely plans on killing people to get it.<br /><br />Quite frankly, Oliver should want some revenge himself since Carter Gray had his wife killed and made his infant daughter disappear all those years ago. But all Oliver wants to do is to keep his sanity, his honor and his self-respect.  And he most definitely wants to keep his ragtag group, the Camel Club, alive through it all.<br /><br />And so Baldacci moves us through the scenes, clearly and inexorably pacing us through the motivations and the murders. The characters are written with incredible depth. Harry Finn is written as a fantastic and talented person, caught in a web of deceit. Baldacci even writes the psychopathic Jerry Bagger as a man who lives by a strict set of principles, albeit they are a bit counter-clockwise to the standard moral compass, but a set of principles nevertheless.<br /><br />And then in the blink of the proverbial eye, Baldacci breaks his steady pace, sets the hook and plunges the reader down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />The promotional blurb for this book indicated that death would come to the Camel Club. However, I became so absorbed in the action and political intrigue and I was so worried about Harry Finn throughout that I completely forgot about the blurb. And then, 33 pages from the end, Baldacci pulled the pin!<br /><br />The death scene and its immediate aftermath are written with a stark and simple prose that is electrifying. And Baldacci writes Oliver's grief in a manner that grips your soul and squeezes it dry.<br /><br />But it is the last chapter of the book that leads you to understand the path Baldacci has been planning for Oliver all this time. And that last chapter also leads you to understand his choice of title for this book. By the end of the chapter it is clear that the title is not only a double entendre, but perhaps a triple entendre if you begin with the old proverb about revenge and a certain dinner dish.blink of the proverbial eye, Baldacci breaks his steady pace, sets the hook and plunges the reader down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />The promotional blurb for this book indicated that death would come to the Camel Club.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I think my expectations were too high for this book. I loved the first two in the series and couldn't wait to read the conclusion.<br /><br />Here are my gripes with is book:(Spoilers)<br /><br />-Repetitive plots. I guess I was looking for something bigger and better.<br /><br />-Confusing back and forth point of veiw. Most of the time I couldn't remember which one was the voice until they mentioned the other person by name.<br /><br />-All the characters seemed to miraculously change their entire personality in ways that totally baffled me. Four became weak and both his parents acted completely out of character. The first two books they showed absolutely no regard for their son now all of a sudden they just back down no problem. It bothered me when I read it.<br /><br />-I'll admit I'm a happy ever after kind of girl and I just hated the end. Mostly because it was anti climactic and a total let down. Just boring and unexciting.<br /><br />-I was expecting so much more. I wanted an exciting ending. The kind of ending where I can't wait to pick up the first book again and start the series over. This book was so depressing. Four is left pitiful and alone and becomes a politician of all things. I am in absolute shock that anyone could rate this book 5 stars.<br /><br />-Now I feel ruined for the movie when I had been looking forward to seeing it.

1905783582|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1MWD4K5R4QZ79]]<br />A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THE RELEVANT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN THE MENA REGION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you, like a growing number of international lawyers are charged with advising clients, say, in the Gulf states or in  North Africa - and those clients are involved in  insurance or reinsurance, then we think it fair to say that this highly specialized, yet accessible handbook has practically been compiled and written just for you.<br /><br />One of the most recent publications from Globe Law and Business, this amazingly useful book provides an overview of the relevant legal framework across a range of jurisdictions in the MENA region. That's the Middle East and North Africa, if by chance you need reminding.<br /><br />The intended aim of the book, says expert editor Michael Kortbawi, is to provide practitioners with `a better understanding of the distinct regulatory environments operating within each country' -- and so it does.  The countries thus examined include -- and we will list them here --Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.<br /><br />Kortbawi and his team of expert contributors are all international practitioners based at Bin Shabib & Associates (BSA) -- a leading Middle Eastern firm involved in providing corporate insurance and regulatory advice to clients mainly in United Arab Emirates, Oman and Iraq. `Developing markets offer new opportunities to insurers', he points out, `given the ever-increasing competition in more mature markets.'<br /><br />It appears that insurers in the MENA region are developing better capabilities and covering larger risks in areas generally characterized by low insurance penetration within environments of rapid growth and correspondingly rapid regulatory change.<br /><br />One of the book's most useful contributions is to break down the language barrier which hitherto has impeded understanding of specific countries' laws and requirements, most of which have been previously set out in Arabic. With remarkable clarity, each chapter maintains a standard structure, consisting of an introduction and overview of the insurance market followed by more detailed examinations of specific areas; from business conduct and licensing requirements, for example, to corporate governance.<br /><br />Another major advantage: `on-the-ground-knowledge' (in the words of the publishers) `of local culture and practices', all of which offers interested parties from insurers and reinsurers to intermediaries a carefully selected and  convenient source of unique insights.<br /><br />With its practical, succinct and business-like approach, this book will no doubt be considered an essential reference tool for insurers seeking to expand their presence in the MENA region, as well as practitioners advising on compliance issues in specific MENA countries.  For insurers, reinsurers and their advisers, the information contained in this up-to-date guide can offer those alert to opportunities in North Africa and the Middle East a valuable competitive advantage.eak down the language barrier which hitherto has impeded understanding of specific countries' laws and requirements, most of which have been previously set out in Arabic.

1909416037|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3QLON1WIWFIKJ]]<br />A BUSINESS ISSUE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This new title from Globe Law and Business is destined to become required reading for practitioners or partners in law firms -- particularly international law firms -- looking to succeed in an increasingly complex and fiercely competitive future.<br /><br />On behalf of the International Bar Association, Consulting Editor Rebecca Normand-Hochman, supported by a high powered team of some seventeen expert contributors, has put together an impressive and insightful volume dealing with all the major aspects of talent management.<br /><br />`Talent management', she says, has come to be considered (certainly by the most advanced law firms) as `a driver of competitiveness... unlikely to be a short term trend'.<br />This the book sets out to prove and does so compellingly and  with conviction, supported throughout with reference to a wide range of hard-headed research from highly reputable sources, including the Harvard Business Review and McKinsey & Company, to cite only a couple of examples.<br /><br />A key theme throughout is motivation, presented as the driving force behind success -- specifically financial success - in the legal profession. `The principal challenge for law firms,' says the editor is `not to motivate their lawyers, but to create the conditions for them to maintain this natural drive and motivation, sense of direction and achievement over the years'.<br /><br />Understandably, the focus here is on international law firms and the productive use of the talents and the talented people therein. By and large, the book places its emphasis on developing the necessary skills and attitudes required to meet the challenges of technological advance, diversity and economic downturn in today's global business arena.<br /><br />Encompassing expertise from a range of sources, from Clifford Chance and Eversheds to the Harvard Business School, the book emphasizes a practical rather than a theoretical approach to the variety of issues under scrutiny, from building sustainable client relationships to women lawyers and how to improve gender balance.<br /><br />The latter of course, is a key aspect of diversity, which as the text asserts `is a business imperative and helps to create a competitive advantage'.  It works, in other words -- and has been shown to work, which this book sets out to prove convincingly.<br /><br />If you are a practitioner or partner seeking ways to further your own professional development, together with advancing the growth of your firm, you'd be well advised to acquire this forward thinking and thought provoking book.ce and Eversheds to the Harvard Business School, the book emphasizes a practical rather than a theoretical approach to the variety of issues under scrutiny, from building sustainable client relationships to women lawyers and how to improve gender balance.<br /><br />The latter of course, is a key aspect of diversity, which as the text asserts `is a business imperative and helps to create a competitive advantage'.

B00CLL1UY6|5.0|It took me some time to understand why the title of this book is Sebastian. The title character doesn't appear very often, but his presence is felt in the stories of those--mostly women--around him.<br /><br />Sebastian, Christoph Fischer's second novel in the Three Nations Trilogy, is set in Vienna and Galicia in Central Europe. His first book in the trilogy, The Luck of the Weissensteiners, is set in Eastern Europe prior, during, and after World War II. Once again, he's written a historical account of life as lived by Jews who hide or abandon their cultural and religious heritage because of fear of prosecution, and it also explores the lives of gentiles who are closely aligned with the Jewish community. The lives of the characters, including Sebastian, create a personal view as the war plays out in the backdrop. The war and all its residual effects are felt in the lives of Sebastian's immediate family and by those that circle him peripherally. No one is particularly religious in both of the books, so it comes as a shock to the characters to be divided along those lines. It forces them to do things they aren't proud of, such as shunning someone because of their heritage or their association with someone of a particular background.<br /><br />Not only is war's turmoil shown through the individuals, but the popular culture is recounted as well. The Glueck family draws Sebastian's mother, Vera, into experiments with psychoanalysis, which is the \\"in\\" thing as Freud emerges on the scene with some outlandish notions about the mind. The occult and seances make an appearance, too. Vera and others seek out meduims to attempt to learn the fate of their husbands and sons sent off to war. Fischer explores these topics and presents both sides as represented by the characters. He doesn't take a side on these issues, but rather provides the reader with provocative thought to ponder the beliefs presented, which are generally disdained by the scientists of the day.<br /><br />World War I goes on around and outside of the lives of Sebatian's extended group, but Vienna remains relatively safe from the war raging just outside its borders.<br /><br />I'm still thinking of the characters and their inability to communicate with one another, which leads to some unnecessary suffering and missed cues. The novel speaks volumes about this issue as lovers are star-crossed until they finally open up and tell the truth. While the communication doesn't bring the couple together, it does provide a resolution to the mixed up wires. T<br /><br />As with his first book in this trilogy, I was shaken out of my ethnocentric self. This time I witnessed the war and its impact by those living through it. The entry of the United States into the fray is nothing more than a blimp on the overall  map of the war fought on the soil of Fischer's setting. The history of the Jews prior to World War I shows that for centuries they feared and suffered at the hands of those in power, particularly in Eastern Europe. Fischer sets the stage for what will happen in the next two decades. Borders and cultures are crossed, bisected, and in some cases, obliterated.<br /><br />Fischer's attention to the real life problems caused by war is impeccable. I love that he can relate history without resorting to boring textbook discourse. The individuals' stories show the harsh reality of what happens to the people actually put at risk during war. We're not privvy to the high-level meetings of the political puppets holding all the strings, but the impact of those decisions are felt through lack of food and resources to survive..<br /><br />If you are a lover of history brought to life through characters, I recommend reading Fischer's novel from the Three Nations Trilogy. You'll learn as well as become compelled to follow the characters to the final resolution, at least for that small portion of history.<br /><br />Fischer has now released the final book in the trilogy, The Black Eagle Inn, whichI hope to read soon. The third book explores post-World War II life in Eastern Europe.I hope to read soon. The third book explores post-World War II life in Eastern Europe.

B0029ATTAQ|3.0|I am a high school English teacher and bought this to go along with the novel 1984.  I have only been able to show a very few select scenes because of all the nudity.  It was a bit shocking and definitely not appropriate to watch at school.
B00000IBRI|5.0|ever since i can remember, i have loved animals, with a special extra level of adoration existing for insects, arachnids, and other arthropods. so, when i read about dario argento’s new movie “creepers” in fangoria (issue #49 to be exact) back around 1985, i was quite excited. then, whatever summer that followed, in a video store in birmingham, alabama, i convinced my friend that we should rent it, we did, and we were on our way.<br /><br />from the very beginning, “creepers” pulls you in, with its' gorgeous, lush photography, revealing wind-blown trees and grass moving like water. when bill wyman and terry taylor’s haunting “valley” begins, we know we’re in for a creepy, beautiful, totally crazy ride. the story of a young girl consigned to a boarding school right out of a roald dahl story, who befriends a scientist and a chimpanzee en route to discovering her latent telepathy with insects and uncovering the trail of a mutant, serial-killer cannibal, is just a delight that permanently engraved itself in my brain...AND in my heart, as well.<br /><br />my friend and i enjoyed the crazy, 82 minute film, which exposed our young brains to something that was both sophisticated in its' visual set-up, and dark and disturbing on its’ insides. “creepers” really appealed to me, most especially because jennifer connelly didn’t just tell insects what to do, but she communicated with them. this meant a lot to me, because insects are rarely regarded as individuals with their own interests and proclivities. but still, the movie seemed incomplete. there were scenes that seemed to end abruptly, or have gaps in dialogue. the movie seemed impatient and impulsive. beautiful, but uneven.<br /><br />imagine my joy when i discovered the full cut, two hours, almost 40 more minutes than “creepers.” even the title, “phenomena,” made much more sense to me; despite being a movie of great intensity and disturbing sequences, it is also a fairy tale, beautiful and heartfelt, filled with magic and mystery. “creepers” was clearly an effort to play up the more exploitative elements of the movie, while “phenomena” is a complete film, both horrible, and dramatic, like a good fairy tale ought to be. i realized what a different ball park we were in when jennifer first gets to the school. in “creepers,” she and sophie talk for like thirty seconds. in “phenomena,” they have a full conversation, sharing aspects of their lives and developing a friendship. “phenomena” also gives us more of donald pleasance’s wonderful entomologist john mcgregor. it’s this forensic entomological aspect that makes “phenomena” extra cool. it’s such a perfect, crazy movie.<br /><br />there is much debate, it seems, about the soundtrack. some seem to find it jarring, unnecessary, and generally out of place. personally, i think it's perfect. the claudio simmonetti operatic tune is just gorgeous. songs by iron maiden, motorhead, and the andi sex gang contribute to the movies tempo and atmosphere, and they modernize a movie that is otherwise set in the rustic alps or whatever. and, of course, let us not forget about sturdy, gorgeous goblin.<br /><br />jennifer connelly is excellent, being at once youthful, and also very determined. her alliance with mcgregor and his chimp, inga, played excellently by tanga, gives the movie a nice sense of community. these three are able to find one another--and support one another--when the community jennifer belongs to at the boarding school, is combative and unbelieving. when watching this movie, pay close attention to inga in each scene; she is hysterical, and very engaged in what is going on.<br /><br />funky, weird, beautiful, passionate, personal, and totally nuts, “phenomena” is one of my favorite movies, and a pure, nightmarish delight to watch every time. i’d love to read a thorough retrospective (or a book) about this sublime film, far and away my favorite argento. i’d be especially curious to hear jennifer connelly’s recollections of making this movie, as well as her thoughts on it today, especially as an oscar-winning, “major” actress.<br /><br />i think the beauty of this movie is summed up nicely when, after being abused and taunted by her schoolmates, jennifer has an episode that draws a zillion flies to the windows of the school as her classmates start to freak out and think that maybe this gal can talk to insects, and she looks at them and says “i love you. i love you all,” and then faints to the ground. perfect.ly curious to hear jennifer connelly’s recollections of making this movie, as well as her thoughts on it today, especially as an oscar-winning, “major” actress.<br /><br />i think the beauty of this movie is summed up nicely when, after being abused and taunted by her schoolmates, jennifer has an episode that draws a zillion flies to the windows of the school as her classmates start to freak out and think that maybe this gal can talk to insects, and she looks at them and says “i love you. i love you all,” and then faints to the ground. perfect.

B00354YA2M|5.0|I've started this review several times, but nothing I write is quite enough.  You'll have to read Bryson to appreciate just how good he is.  Despite having a good working knowledge of the European history of Australia, I now know more about multicultural Australia than I did before reading him.  His depth is astonishing and his humour had me laughing out loud ... on the train.  (I've only ever laughed out loud when reading one other book - the Hitchhikers Guide.)  Read Bryson on anything and (as Molly says) do yourself a favour.

B000BQ7BX2|5.0|In my youth, I read Constance Garnett translations of Dostoevsky. When later translations appeared, I began to know what Dostoevsky really had to say. Gary Bertini has done that for me with Mahler. I am hearing what I sincerely believe is the closest I will ever get to what Mahler intended. Inner voices are clear. Instrumental solos, however brief, are audible. (When, before now, did I hear -- in any other version -- a snippet of the major theme of the 4th movement of Mahler 9 in the first movement of Mahler 3?)<br />Soloists throughout have obviously worked with Bertini to convey not just the words, but their meaning in the musical context. The last movement of Mahler 9 is spectacular, and Bertini's Mahler 1 outshines Kubelik. Bertini and the Cologne Radio Symphony are right there with the &#34;big boys.&#34; Perhaps best is that Bertini has subordinated his ego to what Mahler wrote. No other conductor of Mahler can equal that accomplishment!

1623360277|5.0|Dr John McDougall emphasizes the need for starchy foods such as potatoes, corn, beans, sweet potatoes, rice and other whole grains in whole foods plant based nutrition.  A meal of green leafy or colored vegetables has a multitude of nutrients, but not many calories.  Without slowly-assimilated complex carbohydrate (starch) in the diet, hunger is a problem when trying to consume exclusively healthy foods.  It is the unfortunate legacy of the low-carb craze that has caused the general aversion to starches.  Animal products with their saturated fat and association with cancer have no carbohydrate or fiber.  Starches are slowly converted to blood sugar and provide a steady level of fuel for the body throughout the day without excess fat or protein.  This book is clearly written, contains plenty of scientific documentation, and has lots of recipes.  I recommend it without reservation.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was a fan from when I was first reading Divergent just after it came out and I fell in love with the book.<br /><br />It sent me a new world when is was stressed from this one. I SOON was a little jealous of the love from Tris and Four, then I learned there was more. The first death That left a real impact on was when Al died because I thought the love interest it talked about was with him.<br /><br />At th  end of the book I was waiting for the worst and I got it. This end I g ripped my heart in to man  pieces and threw them into a fire. I was crying until the end then I came back to this world.<br />Now as I write this I am getting ready to read Divergent again and I will cry again.<br /><br />IN SHORT TERMS OF WHAT I SAID THIS IS THE BEST AND SADDEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|The last film basically rebooted the entire timeline for the franchise and all of its characters.  None of the old plot lines we know and love have to be followed, because the butterfly effect literally changed everything. But the cool thing with this film, is it's essentially a remake of The Wrath Of Khan, only everything's a little twisted and askew from the first one; so history, and the future has changed, but still shares echoes from the original events.  Near the end of the film, Kirk delivers Spock's lines from the original Khan, verbatim.  I won't give it away, but fans know what I'm talking about. This was definitely an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. Absolutely LOVED this film!  Easily the best Star Trek film ever made, bar none.  Would definitely watch this again, and can't wait for the next one.  Should be rated 10 stars, not 5. It couldn't have been any better.

B000SEIBB8|3.0|Conceptually, this book is ground-breaking and makes perfect sense.  There are however a few ways to do some of the things the book lays out.  I WISH they would provide some sample code for each Pattern to really go in-depth and show &#34;how to set up a factory to create some widget objects.&#34;  Some are straight-forward enough but some are still only concepts to me.  Maybe I just haven't come across a situation that requires those.  GREAT book, easy to read for the intermediate to pro OOP developer.  If re-use is your goal, YOU MUST HAVE THIS BOOK.

0743435753|4.0|Weber does Space Opera well; the first chapter proves that. It pits nearly equal numbers of Mantacoran ships against a similar wall of Havenites. Their contest is a pugilistic exchange of missile salvoes. This is typical of the increasing savagery of naval campaigns, although it would never occur between grossly mismatched opponents.<br />But Captain Honor Harrington is recuperating (banished from Manticore) on Grayson, attending to steadholder projects. Considering the growing pains experienced by the Grayson Navy, an experienced ship Captain might be offered a commission to conduct training maneuvers against Manticoran units:<br />' The discovery of all that capability had inspired Honor, and her formation for the exercise had looked like a standard deployment, with her SDs in tight and her escorts covering its flanks while a squadron of battlecruisers screened its line of advance. Only the \\"battlecruisers\\" had actually been superdreadnoughts, using their EW [electronic warfare equipment] to mask the true power of their emissions, and the \\"superdreadnoughts\\" had actually been battlecruisers using their EW to augment their emissions. It should have been impossible for Henries to detect at anything over four million klicks, which should have let Honor flush her towed missile pods and get in the first, devastating broadsides from her SDs before his own ships of the wall even realized where the fire was coming from.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Sir Alfred's wiliness had taken most of the punch out of her surprise, and that was her own fault. She'd deliberately come in on a completely predictable course to help him see what she wanted him to. But that had also given him the opportunity to deploy recon drones from beyond the range at which her own sensors could detect their drives. He'd accelerated them up to speed, then shut down their impellers and let them coast straight down her nice, predictable line of approach to such close range that no EW could fool them, and the RDs' lack of power, coupled with their built-in stealth features, had caused her people to miss them even when one physically penetrated her formation.<br /><br />\\"That's how he did it,\\" she repeated to Bagwell. \\"Sneaky devil, isn't he?\\" ' (p. 230-1)<br />?? Has the master of deception lost her touch??<br />This volume is first to reveal the growing empathic bond between Honor and Nimitz, who can sense the mental state of nearby humans.RDs' lack of power, coupled with their built-in stealth features, had caused her people to miss them even when one physically penetrated her formation.<br /><br />\\"That's how he did it,\\" she repeated to Bagwell. \\"Sneaky devil, isn't he?\\" ' (p. 230-1)<br />??

The quality is great - and the storyline is my next favorite to P & P.<br />Mansfield park is a sweet story from start to finish, and Jane Austen really pulls the reader into her fictitious world.

0061998494|5.0|Good book arrived with in  a week of order and well packaged. Holy Christ!Stupid thing wants more words I don't need to write a book about the book and how it arrived but as Amazon wants a word count I think I'll just ramble for a while. I like Ferguson and his TV show and this book filled in his back story with his life as a drunk and doper. I didn't know he was a drummer in a couple of punk bands and now I do. The story of how he sobered up was very entertaining. Who would think that getting drunk could save your life? Well I hope, this meets Amazon word count as I have other things to do so recap. Good Book Fast Shipping Well packaged
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I loved this movie and it's theme.  I highly recommend to families especially in today's society with so many stressors.  The movie has a nice blend of drama, comic relief, and a good story line.  A must see for our times.
B00BMT9SQA|5.0|My son is 14 and we travel alot together and so we were able to relate to some of it because I am just about as goofy as the Mom so he enjoyed this just as much as I did.  Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that kindle finally caught up in the technology world to have this app!!! (My husband would probably disagree only because he's technologically challenged!!!)
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|I really like all the actors in this movie but the movie itself was just OK and very predictable. I bought it for my Kindle and sorry I did.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am impressed with this little gadget. I am sure google has a lot more to come this gadget. currently it only does few things. I hope they allow the stream video from external source. With iPad it has very limited use
B0055G9L9U|5.0|This movie is hilarious but be careful letting kids see it as there are many adult humor parts other than that I highly recommend it for a good laugh.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downtown Abbey is a treasure in television history.  With all the &#34;trash&#34; that we are presented daily in television, it is so wonderful and rewarding to see and enjoy top of the line storytelling and acting.  We need more Julian Fellows.  We need more quality actors such as Maggie Smith, etc.  I was a little disappointed that Shirley McLaine was only featured in a couple of episodes.  Julain keep it coming!!!<br /><br />Elsa M. Lerma, Houston, Texas
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|I wasn't interested in this movie when I first heard about it because it seemed pretty lame, but then I was surprised to hear it had great reviews from everybody watching it so I thought I'd give it a shot. Holy crap was it boring! I went to clean my kitchen after a while and when I came back it seemed like a plot was starting to develop ... we find out something was controlling the monsters and then they were going to take over Earth .... so I began to get interested ... finally a plot was developing ... something to watch ... but it went NOWHERE. We just learned that was the plot then it went back to robots vs dino monsters fighting. In completely unrealistic ways. I LOVE action, but not constantly.<br /><br />It's a good movie for people who don't want to think and just want to see explosions and destruction and fighting, but I need my brain to always be working .. I need to think about everything while watching a movie or I just get SO FREAKING BORED and this movie doesn't give you anything to think about. Any questions you might have get answered right away just to make sure you don't have to think about anything.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Because I was able to accomplished what I needed to accomplished even though we didn't get the desired results which was to retrieve over 700 irreplaceable pictures lost in my gallery when my Kindle Fire crashed for the second time. You just keep replacing Kindle after Kindle which are now 69 dollars which is the price they should have sold for originally because it never has been worth 199 dollars.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I am so angry right now! All the time I wasted on this book just because of its critical acclaim. It might have been somewhat more tolerable if the two main characters in this book had only destroyed each other. But no... the destruction had to be intergenerational with absolutely no peace for anyone after all the dust had settled. Horrible book, horrible ending, and horrible experience!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two, and was excited for this one to be released.  But having to grieve the loss of the character I've followed for 3 books now was a bit much. Certainly wasn't how I wanted to see the series end.  I usually read series I like a couple of times, but I just can't go through that again!  I read for pleasure, and that, quite frankly, wasn't pleasant at all!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic story line, addicting and an overall television classic. Every season just keeps getting better. Looking forward to season 4 in the US. If you're looking for something to capture your attention with fantastic character's, look no further.
B009M2T7K6|4.0|My daughter wanted this so bad especially since her little bff has all of them. I could only get one but she loves it.  She takes it in the bath with her every time (she's 3 about to turn for now). We've had this for a few months now and she sell plays with it. That's amazing cause she plays with toys for about a week and moves on. It changes three lighter pink in the warm water but our only problem is we've never been able to see the more noticeable color change because it needs to be put in ice water and we don't have an ice maker or trays at the  moment. We tried it with a bowl of cold water and a few ice cubes we had left when we first got it but no dice. Doesn't seem to bother her though. She likes mermaids so at this point she just plays in the bath with it and anther Barbie and she's fine. Makes up her own stories as she's playing. The fact that it changes colors is why she wanted it sms now she doesn't care about that anymore. She wants the rest of them but us now into the fairy Barbies. It always changes! So I'll get one of those and let you know how that is. The wings flap! Haha As far as the mermaid doll, I'd recommend it. Its a cute toy and still changes color after a few months of use.
B005ZB91KY|3.0|As far as super hero movies go this is one of the better ones.  Better than any of the X-Men movies and I'm an X-Men fan and collector for decades.  Marvel is doing this right with their lead ups to the Avengers movies so far.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|I love this movie so much! It's such a good family movie, and is incredibly funny and clever! I would definitely recommend this movie.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|I've watched this twice, once with my wife who normally doesn't do sci-fi/fantasy, and once with my kids.  They loved it, but don't know who Kirk and Spock are from Adam.  After watching this we watched the very first episode of Star Trek the '67 TV series.  I've been watching Star Trek since '73 as a three year old and actually like the way Abrams did this movie.  I was wondering what all the concerns with the flare that people have commented on and after seeing this the second time I now see what they mean.  While I understand it for spicing up the cinematography it is over board.  They can let a scene go with it coming in.  And yes, it better not over take any of the Star Wars movies as this is NOT what would have in the first three episodes (e.g. IV, V, and VI).
B0029O08WA|5.0|Great album! Regardless of how you feel about the movie or the Saga, you cannot the deny the amazing songs that were written just for this movie!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|My students loved this story.  &#34;I liked the land of Oz!&#34; A student exclaimed.  &#34;There were some challenges that the solution just came.&#34;
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Just like the movie, this book jumps between different characters. Sometimes it's mid-sentence. It's still a fascinating idea about our karmatic journey through many lives. If you liked the book you'll enjoy the movie and I even think if you liked the movie you should enjoy the book.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I will admit that my expectations were pretty low for this movie based on the previews. I thought it was going to be pretty dumb but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was sweet and funny.  A unexpected love story that kept me very entertained.
0345472322|4.0|This book was easy to read and understand.  Well researched and informative.  Interesting to watch people now and guess their mindset.
B00CW665VI|3.0|Not bad.  Entertaining.  Got very boring about 2/3 way through but it picked up at the end in time to wrap everything up in a big red bow.
B007PLRM9Y|5.0|Review based on standard LP.<br /><br />From the front cover picture it looks like Melody got washed ashore in the Caribbean or a South American shore with these musical sections. Her past 2 albums (CD or LP) were based on her soft seductive singing voice & talented musicianship playing a mix of Jazz & Blues. On this, her 4th album, she expands her repertoire to Latin music while maintaining her expressive voice to the late evening romantic crowd. Some songs are sung in different languages to capture the core of the culture. One song \\"Goodbye\\" Melody sings like an early 1930ish rough Jazz singer totally changing her singing style. I feel like I am in a smokey \\"Speak Easy\\" in Chicago during the depression era with this song. No Tommy guns allowed. I guess all is not Latin in this recording. I am surprised with the negative reviews; do you really want such talent to sing the same style of music every time? I got to hand it to Melody to experiment & grow while other artists crank out the same stuff album after album. The LP version is well recorded with vast sound stage & the many background sound effects that don't get in the way of the music. No pops or hiss, a very clean LP. The LP feels heavy, but I don't see any information stating its 180 grams. For you digital people, Amazon includes all the songs in mp3 with the purchase of the LP.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Melody.
1616614609|5.0|and I wasn't disappointed with this game.  I was hesitant at first because its a LCG and didn't want to spend a ton of money on expansions but found out there is quite a bit of content with this core game.  It comes with 4 corporation factions and 3 runner factions so theres a lot of replay avail and both sides are different so my wife and I switch it up to keep it fresh.  The theme is awesome and we both enjoy it.  I think eventually we'll get into the expansions but there is plenty here to play for a while.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Purchased this because I saw the first season on Netflix and loved it. Netflix doesn't have the second season yet, so I ordered it through amazon.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|This cord was short and just what I was looking for to put in a car adapter. I  am so happy with this purchase.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I bought this item in order to calibrate two IPS displays on my desktop. The main problem with the monitors was that they were inconsistent and displayed colors very differently. After having failed to calibrate the monitors on my own, I decided that it was worth the money to try an automated solution. This product fit the bill and works as advertized. I'm not a photography or digital art professional, but I do have an appreciation of color accuracy and spend enough of my time in front of computer screens to justify the expense.<br /><br />My only comment, and it should be a fairly obvious one in hind-sight, is that users should first set their monitors (if they have multiple displays connected to the same machine) to the same settings prior to running this program. I had forgotten to do this and it had a dramatic affect on the results. After remembering to set my two monitors to the same display settings and re-running the calibration software, the results were much better.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|Great puzzle game. I love this type of simple brain teased. wonderful time filler for those times when you need something fun to do.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|this is a great show. It keeps getting better as the season goes on. It is a mix between and action and drama with a lot of humor mixed in. if you like Joss Whedon's other work (Buffy, Angel, Firefly, The Avengers) you really should check this out.<br /><br />that being said, don't expect the Avengers to be in the show. This show focuses on the human members of SHIELD and how they help hold things together after the events of the Avengers movie.  They deal with people with powers, but they are generally the bad guys that they have to stop.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|I didn't really know Katy Perry until I saw the movie.  While it's not riveting, it is good entertainment, especially if you did not see her in concert.  I do feel like I &#34;know&#34; her after watching her autobiography and I like her more because of it!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|It was a fun light read, definitely worth the purchase. That being said, don't go into it expecting Mistborn or The Way of Kings.  It is far leas complex than his other work, but it is still a deeper work than many YA books. He does throw some twists in there, and the characters are likable and are not as black and white as they seem at the start.
0151003084|5.0|Love this artist. These little pisc ended up being 5 x 5 pages so I cut them out and framed them individually. Looks great!
B00G32TD98|5.0|This was one of the scariest movies that my wife and I have seen in a long time.  Great movie!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|It wasn't as good as Mistborn or Way of Kings but still a fun read. There were some pretty nice surprises at the end.
B00FWPWNKS|3.0|It was ok, not as interesting, kind of slow reacting game.  Would rather play something more fast moving.  Like Ultimate Jewel better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game was waiting a long while for it to finally come out for the kindle fire. Love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app, it is so awesome and fun and addicting.... Love it so so so so so much it's so great
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I was kinda confused, and I feel like the book stopped short and suddenly but I enjoyed this,(with a box of tissues)
B0019OP0GU|5.0|a touching story about orphaned girls brought together in one house being raised by no more than a girl herself (also an orphan) I watched it 3 times already. I really love this story.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|What a game. The fun never stops. Stage after stage. I can't seem to stop. You seem to  know how to make good games.
006202406X|1.0|Wow what can I say that hasn't already been said. I loved Divergent and Insurgent.  I could not put them down. I also could not put down Allegiant but not for the same reason as the first two books.  I kept hoping it would get back to the real story that was in the first two books. I feel this book was from another trilogy and somehow someone made a mistake. The characters that were strong in the first two books seemed like weak minded fools in this one.  It is liek they were totally different characters in this book.  A lot of it did not make sense like stuff was made up just to get the story over. I did not like the direction this book went and it just ruined the trilogy. I do not understand why Tris was killed off.  I usually cry when characters I like die in stories but when Tris was killed I was so disappointed by this point in the whole thing I almost put the book down. I kept hoping it would end up a mistake. I do not understand how someone could write a trilogy and the first two books are so great and then the ending is just so far off it is like someone else wrote it.  I am just so disappointed as I was so excited this book finally was done.  I won't be reading any more of Veronica Roth books.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|this was a great book, I highly. Recommend it for anyone who has memories of the late 50's and early 60's.
1250038820|5.0|I love the Humans of New York facebook page with the little interviews...I wish there were more stories in the book!
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I loved the show but I work shifts and didn't get to see all the episodes.  So this was a great find for me to get to see all the shows, one right after another.  Thanks for having it available for purchase.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Classic. It was witty good action. Enjoyed it thoroughly, even if some parts were far fetched. More realistic than Bond but still an old school spy movie.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|It was a little hard to get into but very enjoyable.  I look forward to reading the rest of the books.
B00005N52P|4.0|I cannot say that I enjoyed this film, but, at the same time will say that it was well written and acted and the poor, small town feel of a dying city came across beautifully.  The only people with ethics either died or entered the military and their absence left the town even poorer than it was.  It is a film worth watching so that discussion can follow, as there is much to think about in this film
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I lost my cord to my Kindle and I was lost with out my reading material. I was please at the speed in getting it.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|This is a film well worth watching an discussing!  It takes a bit of time to see what is developing-- and how the relationship affected one of the characters for life, while narcissism leads the other one to take blame for actions she did not commit so she does not have to admit to illiteracy.
0694013889|5.0|This book was so much fun when our children were young that I just had to have it for our granddaughter who is way too young to even be potty trained!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you like action this is the book. This book is one of my favorites so far! I really hope that the movie catching fire is out soon!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|We love the play; we love the musical; we love reading this book and we will never get tired of it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The topic of foster care is a difficult one to write about.  In this book the author shares quite vividly the struggles a child can go through while in the system.  The characters are so well developed that you get an idea what the child adovcate experiences, the foster parents,and anyother person that is envolved with the child.  You even get a glimpse of how the system in this case tries to protect the child before she ages out.  I liked the different storylines that intertwined throughout the book and eventually becomes one. The symbolism of the flowers and incorporating them into the story was very creative.  The flowers and their meanings become important characters to the story. The main character Victoria has many challenges she endures.  There were some that may make it unconfortable for the reader. In the end love, understanding, and the many possibilities life has to offer wins out.
0634022296|5.0|Any guitarist who enjoys Beatles music and playing it will enjoy this book. We had it spiral bound so that it can open more easily

I've shared 2 songs with friends who immediately were shocked by Mr. Porter's voice & wonderful interpretation of Skylark.  Must hear this man LIVE.  Thank you for such pure sound, Mr. Porter.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I am an avid reader. I have never read a book that has touched me like this. Cheryl Strayed is amazing and so inspirational. So glad that I had the opportunity to find this book.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Finally, a actor who has layers.  A actor who has made James Bond believable & human.  Never liked S. Connery because he always came off as a damn brute to women -- just &#34;things to tolerate.&#34;  Mr. Craig has shown that Bond is a human being who's a spy.  Love, love, love his work, which just gets better & better.
B002NTGKSM|4.0|This was a perfect fit for our family fall fest. Creepy, but not enough to cause nightmares. My only negative would be the scene with the old lady, well-endowed with nothing on but sparkly pasties... That was a little too creepy :P
B008FYZIVY|3.0|Heard so many people rave about the program that I decided to order it.  I haven't watched it yet to I really can't give a review one way or the other.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have drifted away from Stephen King over the past couple years as the genre has become predictable and less than fulfilling, but this has to be my favorite in a long time,  Maybe it was the nostalgia and the desire to get closure for the characters from The Shining or the way King manages to mix mundane with mysterious and malevalent to create a thoroughly enjoyable read/listen.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview is a fantasy novel with magic and thrills. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. It was a really good, entertaining yarn that had all the signs of a great tale. Plot, character development and pacing is spot-on, and I've recommended it to all my friends. It is a must-read and I'll be reading anything else that Brandt Legg puts out. Highly recommended.
B00DQVST76|5.0|AMAZING CONCERT !!!! She never does anything simple is a all around amazing creation by the queen of pop the one and only
0393088774|5.0|I bought this a looong time ago when I was still teaching economics (I finally resigned 3 days ago at 82) and I referred to it in my classes.  It was printed in 2012.  The Nobel prize in Economics is often (usually) won by Americans but the politicians ignore anything that might appear to be based on facts.  And I must admit there is a lot of dissension among economists.<br /><br />Great book, good price, arrived timely.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I really liked this book. It has a lot of useful info. I'm in week 3 of the workouts and have noticed some good changes. I know you can't expect to get in the shape you want to overnight, but in a few months its totally feasible. I'm looking to bulk a bit first and then cut for a couple months. Right now I'm at 6'1&#34; 201lbs. with about 15% body fat. My hope is to finish at around 190 with about 6-8%.  I know diet is huge in getting the body you want, and he makes it easy to figure how much of everything you need, inc. detailed workouts, how much carbs, protein, fats, and overall calories, sleep, etc. He also gives you great info on timing your intake of carbs and protein shakes. I also like the fact that he doesn't use/push a lot of worthless supplements. I've been working out off and on for about 17 yrs and this is the best, most educational piece of literature I've come across. Definitely worth the money if your dedicated to changing you appearance. If your not then you can still pick up some great stuff out of it anyway.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I love to escape to the world that Cassandra Clare has created...it's a delightful love story woven into a world of demons and danger! It is a great story for a teen OR an adult, which surprised me. Never a dull moment in this series.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I laughed until I had tears in my eyes. Bridget's dating woes are still so funny. She navigates modern dating with her usual mix of self deprecation and and crazy mishaps. Anyone woman who has tried to manage motherhood and dating will find Bridget hilarious.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I just wish that there was more coins so you can play longer.. I am so in love with the game!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed this series, but the first book, Wool, was my least favorite. The next two books - Dust & Shift held my attention better.  But you have to read Wool first.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|It's a rather beautiful story.  I just finished it a moment ago and felt compelled to write my review immediately.  I am very much looking forward to more stories from Ms. Zimmer.  This story describes such a pure love.  Sure, there are obstacles that are necessary for the reader to become even more immersed in the possibilities of the outcome, but it's a lovely narrative of two women who figure out who they are and who they are to one another.  I would suggest anyone considering this book to definitely make the purchase.  It's soooo worth it :)
1609611543|2.0|This book is written by a doctor who mixes science with opinion to a point where it invalidates his arguments and turns them into hype. It feels like he is just trying to make a name and sell books not really help people have a healthy diet and control their weight.

1623650003|4.0|\\"Alex\\" by Pierre Lemaitre is not a story for the weak of heart or anyone who becomes squeamish at brutality but if you want a read that takes some of the most amazing twists and turns a number of times and glues you to the pages, then this one is definitely for you.<br />The first half of this story alternates chapters between Alex, a woman who is kidnapped by a mysterious assailant off the streets of Paris and Camille Verhoeven, a short in stature but long is character police commandant who is assigned to find out whether there was a kidnapping at all, who was kidnapped and where the victim is located.<br />The scenes involving Alex in captivity are brutal and at times difficult to read. I found myself wondering whether I could continue reading this type of narrative throughout an entire 300 plus pages story. Camille is an absolutely fascinating man who has suffered a terrible loss of his own involving his wife and daughter. He also is surrounded by compatriots and superiors who each are vividly described by the author and contribute a great deal to every aspect of this book.<br />Then suddenly about 150 pages into the tale, an incredible twist sends the reader in a whole new shocking direction and seems like a fresh new plot that remains violent but will make the book even harder to put down until all the answers are revealed.<br />And if that twist isn't enough, then one more shocker near the conclusion will jolt the story into one more final path that is totally unexpected.<br />None of these twists makes the story anything less than violent, sad and ugly but all of that is required to make the book effective in not only the story line but also in some of the messages that the author is trying to send.<br />Much of \\"Alex\\" is very personal as it reveals hidden motivations of the major characters and to what means a person who is desperate to right a wrong will do.<br />Though there are lots of characters in this book, Lemaitre has done a fine job of focusing on just a few leads and defining them so well that the reader becomes emotionally attached to them in various ways. Goodness and evil are both exploited in the tale and some of the characters are on the border of both.<br />This book has been translated from the French and apparently the author has written more books. If they involve the lead investigators in this particular mystery, then I look forward to reading them.<br />Some may say this plot has been done before but the quality of the execution in \\"Alex\\" is simply fantastic because each chapter holds new revelations, frights and surprises.<br />So with all the warnings to those who find this type of story a tough read, your time will be worth it from the first dramatic page to the final few paragraphs.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy playing Candy Crush Saga for hours, but I'm on the disappointment side with not being giving more points to play, if you win at a high number there should be prizes, gifts, points to help on the level or later... not fair how this work, if you don't purchase items you just struck. this is what making players leaving.

B00821OX98|3.0|Netflix only requires that you rate the program with stars.  I like Netflix's rating system, because I don't want to write a review...only award stars.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|This book had me hooked even before the &#34;big reveal&#34; midway through. Masterful in character development and plot, it's way more than a family story or coming of age tale. It has resonated since I finished it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Wife first saw season one on AMC and when she discovered Season One was on Amazon she could not wait to see this. She would average 3 episodes a day over the course of a week. Loved every minute! Highly rated if you are into Horror Tales.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Mr. Grisham brings a favorite lawyer of mine, Jake Brigance back in Sycamore Row.  Grisham is a fine storyteller and did not let me down.  I admit that after reading one or two of his later books, e,g., innocent Man, I wondered if he was taking the easy way out.  Not this time!  I read a review or two that said this book was a little predictable, and I confess I did figure midway through what might have happened.  But I could not see how the author would bring it all together.  But he did, entertainingly, interestingly, and with realistically.  The ending was not fortold nor unavoidable, so it was satisfying.  The book is not a sequel to Time to Kill, although the same people and places are involved.  But, if you loved Time to Kill, you will love this one.  It was a page-turner, and I was sad when it was over.  I hope to hear more of Clanton, Harry Rex, Judge Atlee, and Jake -- but only if they've got another very good case to tackle.

I became so close to the characters I went from angry to sad, frightened , happy I could not stop reading until I finished the last page.  I needed to be certain everything and everyone was where they belonged. I can't stop talking about this book .

B007ZGBZHE|3.0|A. Pendergast once again leads a creepy almost supernatural quest, this time against Nazis. Nazis...? I wonder where this idea came from, I know it has been building to the climax for a couple of books now but what was the root that started it? The story moves along but I believe that it can't be the first Preston and Child book to read for new readers s there is a long back story that is glossed over while Agent Pendergast does his work. As usual he is wraithlike with his ability to appear unexpectedly working with familiar DaGosta to solve a slew of monstrously gruesome murders. A character from long ago also appears, Corrie Swanson from &#34;A Still Life, with Crows&#34; and provides some distractions.<br />I gave it three stars because the plot was a little strange and if you have been following Agent Pendergast and Vinnie DaGosta for a number of books now it seemed they were both very out of character in many parts.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|A bit hard to follow at first view, then I realize it is a sequal to casino royale.  and enjoyed it.  Not written by Fleming
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|The 2008 science-fiction thriller “Cloverfield” was written by Drew Goddard, produced by J.J. Abrams, and directed by Matt Reeves.  The film boasts one of the greatest hypes of all time; a teaser trailer was released during the previews to the summer-2007 movie “Transformers,” the title remained unknown until the second teaser which appeared before the fall-2007 movie “Beowulf.”  This is definitely one of those movies that keeps the heart racing.  I highly recommend adding it to your collection because, to really put the little and important nuances into perspective, you may have to watch several times.<br /><br />BACKGROUND:  Despite the online viral marketing, the actual plot for “Cloverfield” was well hidden.  Various websites popped up to preempt the film’s release, but the only sanctioned sites were ‘1-18-08.com’ (which touted still-shots from the movie conveying panic and frenzy, yet kept fans guessing as to what might be the cause of such terror) and ‘[...]’ (which provided a sneak-peak to an annihilated Manhattan as well as a clip of the monster’s roar).  To protect the screenplay, actors were auditioned with scripts not intended for use in the movie itself—the selected cast had no idea what they were getting into.  During production, the film was given several codename titles to conceal the identity of “Cloverfield.”<br /><br />Abrams credits his inspiration for the movie to a trip he took with his son to a Japanese toy store; he said he wanted to create an American counterpart to King Kong and Godzilla.  While filming, the ‘Cloverfield Monster’ had not yet been incorporated, so the actors had to pretend they were scared of something else.  The monster’s final design is attributed to artist Neville Page; the creature’s rampage is caused by separation anxiety:  it is a young ‘monsterling’ trying to cope with loneliness and an unfamiliar environment.<br /><br />One of the most noticeable things about “Cloverfield” is its cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style, meaning that it is shot to look as if one of the characters is recording each of the scenes through a handheld camcorder.  While the cinematography accomplished an authentic feel, many were upset with the shaky-camera look, complaining that it gives a feeling of motion sickness.<br /><br />STARRING ROLES include:  Michael Stahl-David as Rob Hawkins, Odette Yustman as Beth MacIntyre, T.J. Miller as Hudson “Hud” Platt, Lizzy Caplan as Marlena Diamond, Jessica Lucas as Lily Ford, Mike Vogel as Jason Hawkins, Ben Feldman as Travis, and Billy Brown as Staff Sergeant Price.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  The United States Department of Defense is examining Rob’s camcorder of personal footage from the events from “Cloverfield;” most of the recording is time-stamped from 5-22-09, but because the camera was damaged, cuts from previous recordings appear throughout the movie.  A cut from 4-27-09 shows that Rob has slept with his good friend Beth.  On 5-22-09, Hud begins recording the going-away party (thrown by Lily and Jason) for Rob, who is moving to Japan.  Since their hookup, Rob and Beth have experienced a ‘falling-out;’ Beth brings a date to the party which leads to an expression of animosity from Rob.  After Beth leaves the party, Manhattan experiences what feels like an earthquake.  They initially believe the flickering power is due to a capsized oil tanker that collided with Liberty Island.  All beliefs are suspended when they see that the head of the Statue of Liberty has been propelled into the streets of Manhattan; Hud catches his first glimpse of the monster.<br /><br />The Army National Guard has been deployed to combat the smaller menaces that appear to ‘bud’ from the main monster.  A massive evacuation of Manhattan across the Brooklyn Bridge ends in turmoil when the monster tail-whips the bridge into smithereens.  Rob gets a voicemail from Beth saying that she trapped in her apartment; Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena venture to Midtown to free Beth.  While traveling through the subway tunnels, Marlena is bitten by one of the ‘budded’ monsters.  The group reaches an army triage where they are warned of their closing timeline for saving Beth and the last chance to escape on an evacuation helicopter; once the last helicopter departs, “Hammer Down Protocol” will annihilate Manhattan.<br /><br />Once they free Beth, the group high-tails it to the evacuation site.  When their helicopter takes off, the first bomb is dropped on the monster.  Irritated, the monster swipes their helicopter from the sky.  Rob and Beth survive the crash and take shelter in Central Park’s Greyshot Arch.  The two use their final moments before the air raid to confess their love and leave testimonials on the camera…  [Not spoiling the ending, but pay attention to the final cut on 4-27-09, specifically the ocean in the distant background.]rough the subway tunnels, Marlena is bitten by one of the ‘budded’ monsters.

B000MNP2K8|5.0|Craig is excellent as James Bond.  I really enjoy this and my husband who is a BIG James Bond fans agrees.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This movie has adventure, science, genetics, twists, comedy, scary monsters, and a great cast. While the movie is a little old now, it was really among the first to predict some of the headway we'd make in genetic manipulation.  This movie was especially important to me because it really piqued my interest in both prehistoric history as well as genetics and world change.  For the technology available at the time, the graphics are extremely well done and believable. Viewers are made to feel as if they're actually in the movie. And no one could ever forget the raptors in the kitchen, perhaps my favorite scene. I hope anyone reading these comments who hasn't seen the movie will at least watch it and hopefully buy it as a keepsake.

B00000G3AZ|3.0|The 1996 movie-rendition of Jane Austen's 1815 novel \\"Emma\\" was directed by Douglas McGrath who initially wanted to give the film a modernized setting and storyline.  When the movie \\"Clueless\\" was announced, plans for updating \\"Emma\\" quickly dissolved.  In proper Austen fashion, the story depicts the importance of marriage to a woman's status during the early 19th century.  Other than a script that enhances the comedic tension between George and Emma, McGarth was careful to keep the film as close to Austen's original plot as possible.  In the interest of the benevolent film heroine, it has also been noted that movie-Emma undergoes a lesser self-revelation than the Emma Austen portrayed. I enjoyed watching this movie and I think there is a lot to appreciate about some of the film's finer points:  costumes, direction, scenery, etc.  Unfortunately, the storyline gets overshadowed by the \\"Clueless\\" rendition, which adds extra humor and a novel spin on Austen's original book.<br /><br />Starring roles include:  Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma Woodhouse, Denys Hawthorne as Mr. Woodhouse, Jeremy Northam as George Knightley, Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill, Toni Collette as Harriet Smith, Alan Cumming as Rev. Elton, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton, Phyllida Law as Mrs. Bates, Sophie Thompson as Miss Bates, Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax, and Greta Scacchi as Anne Taylor, to name a few.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  Young Emma Woodhouse fancies herself quite the matchmaker when Miss Taylor, Emma's former governess, is wed to Mr. Weston.  Mr. Woodhouse and George Knightley see things differently, and now fear the mis-matchmaking monster has her eyes set on Reverend Elton and Harriet Smith--a pair highly distanced in the opinion of society-types.  Despite Harriet being \\"low class,\\" she and Emma grow fond of one another.  Emma is oblivious to both the chemistry between Harriet and Robert Martin, and the affections bestowed on her by Mr. Elton.<br /><br />After a failed match between Mr. Elton and Harriet, Emma is determined to find a man for Harriet, even if it is Frank Churchill, a love interest of her own.  To Emma's dismay, Frank is in love with another. Harriet begins to desire George Knightley due to his polite, gentlemanly nature; Emma's ignorance becomes less blissful, causing her to act shamefully toward another woman, the humble Miss Bates.  George becomes infuriated with Emma's recent actions, creating a rift between the two just in time for Emma to realize her own feelings for George.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Emma and Harriet are no longer speaking, a result of their mutual attraction to Mr. Knightley.  The movie comes to a climax when George and Emma are reunited in a meadow; they confess their love for one another and become engaged--an occurrence that fuels the fire between Emma and Harriet.  Emma realizes the errors of her meddling and reconciles with Harriet, who has found her own happiness with Robert Martin.Harriet, Emma is determined to find a man for Harriet, even if it is Frank Churchill, a love interest of her own.

6305907145|3.0|OVERVIEW:  Loosely based on Jane Austen's novel, \\"Mansfield Park,\\" the 1999 film of the same name is a dramatic romantic-comedy directed and co-written by Patricia Rozema.  Despite the movie's considerable deviations from Austen's novel, it debuted with mostly favorable reception; \\"Mansfield Park\\" holds ratings of 76% and 71% from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively.  As a fan of Jane Austen novels and their on-screen adaptations, I can say that I was initially disappointed to learn of the liberties taken by this screenplay; however, once I considered the number of films adapted from the original \\"Mansfield Park\\" novel, I began to appreciate the necessity of Rozema's plot and character changes.  Taken as a film and separate from the novel, I believe this is a fantastically written and acted screenplay--in this sense, I feel Rozema has successfully embodied the wit and emotional torment that underlies Austen's original plot, and far better so than is seen with other film versions of this novel--which may, after all, be the best way to pay homage to the influential writing of the great Jane Austen.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:  (1-disc / PG-13 / Released 7-11-00 / 112 min. run-time)  includes Audio Commentary and Making Of \\"Mansfield Park.\\"<br /><br />DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOOK AND FILM:  An entertaining and intelligent film all-its-own, I think it's fair to note a few of the differences between \\"Mansfield Park\\" `the novel' and `the 1999 film' for prospective viewers.  The first variation occurs with the prominence of slavery as a theme; the issue, lightly touched upon in the book, gains a central role in the film.  Throughout the movie, Fanny's status as a poor female is compared to that of a slave, yet contrast occurs between their respective treatments.  Secondly, the film version incorporates events from the life of the real Jane Austen (in lieu of those about which she wrote), exemplified by the film's portrayal of Fanny's initial acceptance to Henry's proposal, which she later recants.  In addition, Fanny Price's character undergoes several fundamental changes, most noticeably that she is written as a much stronger person in the film version.  Most of the lesser variations can be summarized as changes to characters, timelines, and plot focus.<br /><br />STARRING ROLES include:  Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price/Bertram, Alessandro Nevola as Henry Crawford, Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas Bertram, Lindsay Duncan as Lady Bertram/Mrs. Price, James Purefoy as Tom Bertram, Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Rushworth, Jonny Lee Miller as Edmund Bertram, Victoria Hamilton as Maria Bertram, Embeth Davidtz as Mary Crawford, Justine Waddell as Julia Bertram, Sophia Myles as Susan Price, Sheila Gish as Mrs. Norris, Hilton McRae as Mr. Price, Anna Popplewell as Betsey, and Hannah Taylor-Gordon as young Fanny Price.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  Mrs. Price (sister of Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris) married Mr. Price for love, not money.  The Price family's financial struggles are eased when their 10-year-old daughter, Fanny, is sent to live with her mother's wealthy relatives, the Bertrams, at Mansfield Park.  Aside from Edmund Bertram, one of her cousins, Fanny is treated more like a household servant than a family member.  Knowing she cannot return home to her own family, Fanny feels trapped, which often elicits comparison between Fanny and the numerous Bertram slaves to whom the family owes its wealth.<br /><br />Eight years later, the issue of slavery comes under fire.  Fear the financial toll that abolition poses for the Bertram family, Sir Thomas and his son, Tom, make a trip to Antigua to see a stop to any rebellions.  During their absence, the young and worldly siblings, Henry and Mary Crawford, pay a visit to Mansfield Park.  Even though she is engaged to Mr. Rushworth, Maria salaciously competes with her sister, Julie, for Henry's attention; because Edmund focuses his attention on Mary, Fanny feels unwanted.<br /><br />Upon his return to Mansfield Park, Tom is accompanied by a friend, Mr. Yates; together, the two young men insist on conducting a reenactment of the play \\"Lovers' Vows,\\" a welcomed excuse for the Bertrams and Crawfords to flirt with one another.  Just as Maria `pretends' to seduce Henry, Sir Thomas returns home and quickly puts a stop to the play.  Shortly thereafter, Maria weds Mr. Rushworth; she and Julia move to Brighton.  Henry, now bored at the loss of Maria's attention, sets his sights on Fanny (who does not return his favor).  Much to his surprise, Henry develops deep feelings for Fanny, leading to his request for Fanny's hand in marriage.  Repulsed by Henry's previous treatment of the Bertram girls, Fanny refuses the proposal.  Angered by the rejection of what he deems to be a \\"generous\\" offer, Sir Thomas sends Fanny back to live with the Price family.<br /><br />Soon after Fanny's return home, Henry pays a visit to the Price family in hopes that he might convince Fanny to reconsider his proposal.  When Fanny receives a letter from Edmund, notifying her of his intentions with Mary, Fanny becomes open to \\"settling\\" for Henry--she quickly regains her senses and, once again, denies his offer.<br /><br />Meanwhile, at Mansfield Park, Tom has fallen ill and requires Fanny's tender caretaking.  Edmond retrieves Fanny; on their way back to the Bertram home, tension between the two exposes their mutual feelings for one another.  Julia and the now-married Maria Rushworth return shortly thereafter.  When Fanny and Edmund discover Maria and Henry's affair, the two grow even closer, almost tempting Edmund to forsake his affections for Mary.  Once news of the adultery breaks, Mary attempts to patch the shame by suggesting Maria and Henry wed.  Fanny questions how the Crawfords can afford two weddings, leading Mary to give a cold-hearted response concerning the fortune Edmund will inherit upon Tom's death.  Edmund is disgusted by Mary's true intentions and denounces his attachment to Mary....

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Not sure what Roth's whole purpose was with this book.  She broke the single POV angle of the first 2 books.  She made the outside world boring and more a disgruntled society than dystopic. She gave the readers nothing in the end except for regret for buying and reading the book.  No Divergent movies for me in the future.

But slowly, all the issues are coming together.  Don't get this Season or any episode in this season if you do not like zombie gore!  It is still early in the season, and i just watched episode three.  Hopefully the season will continue at a decent pace.
B00AO3K01C|4.0|Very well written story by a gifted author. Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for good reason.  Two main characters. Especially the Young japanese/American woman/young girl is a unique character and very interesting to get to know. You dont put that book down until you have finished it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is close to Bejewel, but adding intense combinations to clear each board before moving forward.  Just  one concern, the purchase was free but after getting to board 30 you will need to have a facebook friend playing who can help you along or you have to purchase treats to continue. I feel that this try away from the fun of playing, but try to have fun riding the train.

I am glad I read it.

B001VLXNO2|5.0|I thought this was a great story on the life of George Mallory and an easy read.  I'm still pondering the possibility that he was the first man to reach the summit of Everest.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Storyline was interesting and the character development was top notch.  Each story thread and their sequencing kept the pace fresh and thrilling. I can't wait for future issues that explore the world shaped in WOOL.  There are so many possibilities for Hugh to explore that I can't stop thinking about the way he might approach the challenge.  In the mean time, I will be sampling more of his work - as I suggest you do as well. WOOL is a fun read and will not leave you disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was fantastic.  I loved the characters, the emotions, and the love between Holder and Sky.  I laughed and I cried and I couldn't put this book down until I finished it.  I am looking forward to the sequel book.  Highly recommend this book to all.
006202406X|1.0|People should probably not even read allegiant or if you haven't started the series spare yourself and read something else instead. Also considering boycotting the movie just on principle..
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I liked finding out what happened to Danny after the Shining - great great tie in to Jacks life also.
8866135887|5.0|As usual, Moleskin never disappoints. Love my calendar! Big enough to see everything clearly, small enough for on the go.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Well done acting, but not a fan of the plot.  AM sure it will hit cult status with some though...
B008D28HYS|5.0|I enjoy this game because it combines intellect with art. It gives me a sense of satisfaction to complete a picture.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This was definitely a page turner. When I wasn't reading it my mind often drifted to the characters. WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?! I only gave it 4 stars because the kill off off the main bad gal was kind of easy and quick but loved the rest of the book. Been reading King for over 20 years and will keep on being a fan. I wouldn't miss this one!
B003RT0NK8|5.0|Highly recommend!  Great effects, cast, pacing.  A movie I go back to every now and then.Danny Boyle at his best!
B002BBJ52U|3.0|Romantic comedies are tough - no matter - in this postmodern, cynical world.  This one tries its very best, with an all-star A list cast, but ultimately it's a talkfest without any real surprises or treats to satisfy viewers.  Nothing bad about it but, then again, nothing very memorable. For $1.99 it's basically eye-candy.  Only one noteworthy performance: Jennifer Connolly is so unlikeable she should sue her agent for putting her in a frothy romantic comedy where she's clearly a fish out of water.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This book is full of amazing insights and is one of the most delightful reads I've experienced this year --  my choice for book of the year. I belong to a &#34;non-fiction&#34; reading club; so I read at least one or two good books each month.<br />Gladwell's narrative  style and his choice of supporting examples result in a page turner that is hard to put down.<br />Like Gladwell's other masterpiece,  Outliers, David And Goliath, should be read by all Americans in a leader ship role and especially by anyone with a special needs child.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really fun and addictive game for some reason I just cannot stop playing it id recommend it to anyone with quick reflexes
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jackson dips into Bluegrass and does a fantastic job. He says that he had been wanting to do a bluegrass album for a long time and he hits it right on the head. &#34;Ain't Got Trouble Now&#34; and &#34;Appalachian Mountain Girl&#34; are my favorites.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I love this game.  It really makes you think how to solve the problem of taking all the buttons off.
6302517028|4.0|Excellent Movie<br />Brand New<br />Grand Kiddies love it<br />Glad it was still available<br /><br />film clarity was good<br /><br />appears to be rugged
B00FPH6A70|5.0|I love horror movies that make me jump, have a plot and entice me to watch again.  This movie delivered and I really enjoyed it. I love that it was based on a true story.  I think some of the Hollywood embellishments made it a wee bit cheesy in parts, but in all, it was a good one and worth a watch
006202406X|1.0|** Will contain SPOILERS**<br /><br />Fell in love with Divergent, liked Insurgent, hated Allegiant. I read A LOT and I mean A LOT of YA literature and beyond and I have to say even taking a step back from the ending (which I absolutely hated) there were a lot of things I simply didn't connect with concerning this book. The POV switch was bland and honestly Four became much more unlikable. I really was over the whole \\"I'm a jealous 16 year old back off my bf attitude\\". Fore real, you include THAT in this book? I was so disappointed in the world/life beyond Chicago. Truly, I was just sad it wasn't in Chicago basically at all. It was very convoluted and the world beyond and the GD/GP concept, though semi acceptable, still did not do it for me. It was truly anti climatic. I found myself caring a lot less about this rebellion and skimmed every other page. It truly took a lot away from the sacrifices in Divergent and Insurgent. Uriah's death was also very lack luster and pointless. Overall, I just didn't think it lived up to the first book in the series.<br /><br />I also understand WHY Veronica Roth wrote the character threads the way they turned out, I even fully understand and comprehend the message behind Tris's death and beyond. Did it still mean I thought it was the best ending? No. I don't always need a HEA, but in this type of series I felt it was needed. Do you expect to remain a popular writer if you upset 3/4 of your fan base by trying to be \\"edgy\\" or \\"realistic\\" in a series which is decidedly not real life? I just feel the ball was dropped. I'm sure some agree with me and some don't just my opinion. I probably won't be recommending this series to anyone else.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I love the humor, action and actors in the new series. I hope there another one coming soon that is just as good
B004X6PRO6|4.0|You've read the reviews, they're all true.  This is a remarkable work and a very difficult journey.<br />I recommend this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although, you should start on season one, season 3 was great!  I watched the whole thing in 2 weeks.  Can't wait for season 4!
B009UNGYHG|1.0|This headset makes an extremely LOUD burst of static every time you connect the phone. (Hurting your ears) and after only part time use for 2 months, its making all sorts of weird sounds and nobody can hear me.  I expect something to last longer than that.  Maybe they should just have a rental program.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The full version is the only way to go on this game. It is not only a seek and find puzzle but also a maze with very nice artwork.Not boring for an adult. Lots of problem solving, along with just memory tasks
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I saw my sister playing this and it looked like fun. .....well it is!<br />It's nice to pick the level of playing, especially when you are a beginner.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game.  Lots of fun.  Can play for hours. Highly addictive. My family members love it as well.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Really enjoyed this one.  I'm stingy with my stars so no &#34;5&#34;, but it was close.  This book really moves and you're kept intrigued the entire time.
B000FC130E|4.0|This was like the Wizard of Oz meets Harry Potter. One man's journey of self discovery through the sewers and tunnels beneath London. Well written and a great read. I can highly recommend this book.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love the movie.  I have watched it many times.<br />I love the whole series and will do a Twilight Day!
B004LROMSO|1.0|Didn't really care for it. Much prefer the show merlin. Camelot just was not for me at all. Oh well
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|I am a big fan of Jack Johnson.  This album is true to his past music.  However, that being said, there are no real standout songs on this album.  So, it plays through kinda boring.  I definitely don't regret the purchase though.
B00003CX9W|4.0|This was one of my all time favorite childhood memories. This movie I could watch over and over. No problems with it.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|A great reminder to live from our heart. Trying to please everyone else at the expense of following our heart, we will lose our lives.
B00013RC8O|5.0|if u like chase scenes, this movie is 4 u!!!gr8 action. not much plot, barry newman does a good job,  watch 4 the nude rider
B0002TJGQS|2.0|These batteries does not last very long for my glucose meter but could be better for other products.The meter will not work if the voltage drops one point under 3v.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This so is so great I love it. Every holiday they have the theme of that holiday like Halloween is coming well it's Halloween in subway surfers.I love the so so much
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it seams that kindle fire users have finally gotten. there wish....YEA!!!!! it really works and the picture. is so clear. I will be here all night long playing this. lol
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is really good if u like this sort of game. I'm finding myself wanting the energy to hurry up so I can play more.
1401900526|5.0|yes to louise hay... bravo... great as gifts... i just love them... well worth the money and time to read them...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun .You should get this game ,but if you don't have no connection you can't play.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app.  Easy to use and gives all the info on one screen.  I had been using the Weather Channel but thought I would try AccuWeather.  Glad I did. Thanks Amazon!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series has a captivating storyline and powerful character development. Filmed beautifully and brings intriguing insight into this privileged lifestyle and historical time.
B00915G6NK|5.0|This season is just as good as the rest! I can always catch up on the episodes that I missed during the season.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series has a captivating storyline and powerful character development. Filmed beautifully and brings intriguing insight into this privileged lifestyle and historical time.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|What's not to love, the passing of high school and trying to figure out what to do with your life. The ups and downs of the original characters and the integration of new ones blended in seamlessly. If you liked the first three seasons, the fourth one will not disappoint.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Such a great casting for this movie. Leonardo Dicaprio is brilliant. I had not watched the trailer beforehand, so I was really captivated by the filmmakers styling choices, design, soundtrack, and modern twist. What a beautifully done movie. I only wished that I bought the movie instead of renting it so I can watch it over and over again.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I avoided the initial candy crush saga frenzy, and I have to say I doubt I will miss it.....I play a lot of puzzle games and the lives in this game attempt to make you spend money.....too short and too few.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|Given the familiarity that many people have with the plot of Gravity (2013 release; 90 min.), I will dispense with a short introduction of the movie, and instead will delve straight into my thoughts and comments.<br /><br />First and foremost, the photography in this movie is nothing short of stunning, in every sense of the word. The movie starts with an uninterrupted shot lasting a number of minutes as we get to know the characters played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I found myself staring at the big screen in total shock and awe (and I mean that as a compliment). Just when you think that's it's all form over substance, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, previously best known for Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n (2001) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), in fact fleshes out the Sandra Bullock enough that we care for her and that we are emotionally invested, a key ingredient for any movie to be truly successful. And just when you think that you've seen it all, there is yet more to come. I was very impressed with Sandra Bullock's performance, and the buzz about her being nominated for Best Actress Oscar is certainly deserved. Last but certainly not least, I very much enjoyed the musical score by Steven Price (the soundtrack is available on Amazon).<br /><br />Bottom line: this movie truly is a one-of-a-kind movie, and a unique experience that you will best enjoy on the big screen and in 3D. (This movie is the best use of 3D since \\"Avatar\\".) If you haven't seen \\"Gravity\\" yet, believe the hype and do yourself a favor and go see this in the theatre. \\"Gravity\\" is HIGHLY&lt; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B008ROG6E0|5.0|Absolutely love this movie.  Saw it years ago when it first came out and was happy to see that it was on Prime.  Can't understand why this isn't considered a classic.  Michael York is splendid as usual...
B0055D3EOG|3.0|While I would not rate it as high as &#34;The Conjuring,&#34; &#34;Insidious&#34; is still a solid horror flick with some genuine surprises and scares.  Performances are good, with Lin Shaye delivering a great performance as Elise.
B00G32OER4|5.0|In my opinion, what makes a truly scary movie is when you know it's based on fact.  I'm not one for a movie that's all blood and gore and leaves nothing to the imagination...this one leaves plenty to the imagination!  This was beautifully directed with just the right amount of eerie silence during which you would find yourself holding your breath waiting for the next scare. The creaking doors, the intense pounding sounds, the tugs and bruising on the family members all caused by mostly unseen objects added to the escalating suspense and set the mood for the frightening climax.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good scare.<br /><br />BTW, Lorraine Warren appears as herself 44 minutes into the film.  She is the gray haired lady with the black jacket and the white blouse sitting upfront during the lecture.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|yeezus is the s***. the songs are good and some songs are really good. It sounds like music. i have it on 78 inch vineel
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is absolutly the best game I have ever played.<br /><br />The story is amazing, really gives to the feel that the character is just... real. Everytime I made a decision the reactions they have give me either guilt for sincerely makes me happy.<br />Voice acting is awesome.<br />Gameplay amazing.<br /><br />Played it through twice now!
B00006LSM3|5.0|Small notes:<br /><br />*admit I didn't buy this album at first, figuring that another post-Beatle album ala what you get from McCartney could be hit but probably more likely miss, but a friend passed this along to me a while ago and I'm so glad he did<br /><br />*what's so remarkable about this is the consistency of the excellence.  Unlike a lot of older artists, George's voice sounds even better than it did years earlier and is up-front in this collection and you can't help but marvel.  But the songs - so consistently good, with nary a bad song on the album.<br /><br />*the album is in turns funny, laughable, sad, and reflective - but without anger or bitterness to spoil the mood.  Take the P2 Vatican Blues which under a different approach could have been a vindictive song (to some folks) but the overall effect is sublime comedy with a jaunty tune that can't help but make you chuckle.<br /><br />*songs like Rising Sun feature Harrison's distinctive guitar work to great effect with truly haunting lovely melodies.  Course, the whole album is like that - just great stuff.<br /><br />I believe I own every Harrison album ever recorded and have to believe this is the most \\"listenable\\" album he ever did.  As such, it is a worthy testament to his whole career - from Don't Bother Me to Brainwashed you can't help but think the \\"Quiet Beatle\\" certainly offered up stellar stuff from start to finish.  My only regret is that there isn't more....
B00BAXFECK|4.0|This novel would be better if it were shorter. A good High school English teacher, never mind an editor, would have tightened up the prose; but mainly:  why do we have to know the narrator's every dream, every thought, every drug-induced hallucination?
B000ICZD4I|5.0|This is a great movie for young teens and up. The lessons of loving everyone, and being yourself, are all throughout this movie. Wonderful mother/daughter movie.
1569242739|5.0|I used this book to make a medley of cupcakes for my wedding, and they were all easy to make and delicious.  I'm probably the only person in attendance who vigilantly avoids dairy, but all of our usually lactose indulgent guests enjoyed the treats throughly!<br /><br />Really, they loved them, and I can't recommend this book enough.  If you like to make vegan cupcakes, it's really the way to go.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was so sad at times. I shed some tears on this one.  It is a story of hope for certain.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very glad that Candy Crush Saga is now on Kindle! I appreciate the larger visual area and ease of operation.
B008Y212PI|4.0|playing this game on a 1st gen kindle with no issues. I like games that require a little thought and this fits the bill. it is easier then other games that I have played of this type but sometimes that is all you need (something not so challenging that you get frustrated.) I did pick this up as the faotd quite awhile ago but to get bonus puzzles was told I needed to leave a review or like on facebook... hate that
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|At first, I was a little skeptical about this book. But by the middle of it, I was hooked. The ending is really surprising, and overall this book was nothing like I was expecting. I was pleasantly surprised, and will be reading the sequel next.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|There is too much sex in the book.  However, it leaves you wanting to know how they will make it in their marriage.
B00CPLGGWS|5.0|This CPU is freaking fast. I haven't tried the IGPU yet, because I have it paired with HD 7850 2 GB and 8 GB RAM + 120GB SSD<br />Awesome and affordable build. Play all of my games on ultra 1080p :)
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I tryed to download ten time got rid of most of my apps and still won't. download so fix this or I keep posting this
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Similar to Gone With Wind...but not so much a love story...rather the struggle of the women & men who lived in South in the late 1880's...
B005KLZWZC|5.0|My son loves the set! He still prefers reading an actual book vs anything on a tablet. Great book set to add to the rest!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game was a fun diversion after a long day...puzzles were not overly challenging,only enough so to be entertaining.My son found it as enjoyable as I did.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|It's a captivating show that draws the audience in quite easily.  One reason is the complexity of the storyline and the other is the development of the characters.<br /><br />I wish they would get the rest of them.
006202406X|2.0|*****SPOILER ALERT******<br />Divergent is probably one of the best books I've ever read.  I can't say I liked Insurgent as much, but I was still anxious to see how the story ended. Now, I wish I had stopped reading after Insurgent.  I agree with the reviewers who feel that Allegiant ruined the series.  I hate to say that, because I respect the author's right to tell the story that she was trying to tell.  But when I think about the story that I was reading, the lessons I thought I was learning, and the message I thought she was trying to deliver, the ending felt like an unnecessary letdown.  Harry Potter would not have been better if Harry had died (as VR once stated) and this book would have been much better if Tris had lived.  I feel that it's a hard lesson that VR will learn with the reader response.  That's not to say that everyone is going to hate this book or disagree, but I personally think Tris's death let some of the power out of the ending.  It could have been such a victory, but instead, the last 10% of the book read like a funeral--sad, depressing, and just a lot of asking, \\"why\\"?  I kind of wish I could un-read this to be honest, and read a fan-fiction ending instead.  Sorry VR...Divergent is still my favorite book ever.  Maybe it's not too late to release an \\"Allegiant:  Alternate Ending\\"?<br /><br />Besides the ending, I also felt let down that Chicago was just an experiment.  I was hoping that they really were the only people left, or that Edith Prior's message was 100% true.  Basically it was all one big lie and the hero dies.  That sums it up.  And for such an awesome storyline, it could have been so much better.
0345473035|5.0|I bought baby whisperer when I had my baby, I had no idea of how to take care of a baby and did not know how complicated it can be when your mom is not around. This book helped me and my baby in those first months. Now I'm reading the toddler book and I have gave away many copies of this book to new moms.
B003730LRY|4.0|This is a fun movie that my daughter and I always watch around Halloween. No Oscar's were handed out for the performance, but it is fun nonetheless.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Region 4-5!!!!! IPhone has both why can't kindle up your game. I need more time to be wasted!!<br />Three regions isn't enough I need more!!! Please and thank you!
B000W453KQ|5.0|The Way We Were keeps getting better and better with age!<br />Saw it as a young girl when it was first released.  Now have<br />the DVD.  Wish those deleted scenes had been included in<br />the film.  Everytime I view it, I learn something new, see<br />something I had not seen before.  The first time I saw it in<br />college I agreed with Redford's character.  Then a few years<br />ago, I saw it a second time while recuperating from a severely<br />fractured leg and I agreed with Streisand's character.  Now<br />seeing it a third time, I am now longer polarized and could<br />actually see their characters marrying in a sequel.  Where's<br />my sequel?
0486268659|5.0|needed information for a<br />chrismas skit---the book provided the information required.  also a great addition to my library.  good bye.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|our little guy has loved this toy from 3 months on!  just plop him in and he can play with fun colors with his hands, grab at the hanging birds, and bounce when his legs get long enough to touch the ground...best toy he's gotten and we'd recommend it to anyone even though it's a bit pricey at around $100 bucks.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Wish it would save to SD card instead of staying on phone. Good selection and easy to use. Seems to play fine on my Galaxy 4
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie - people of all ages can enjoy.  Quick ship and the blu-ray was as described.  Great Movie for the family
B00DJUPLY8|5.0|I was having trouble with the audio codec not being supported in multiple other players. This player seems to have a broader array of supported codecs. Its all I use for now.
B003Y5H556|4.0|Blu-ray was shipped quickly at an affordable price.  I didn't give it a 5 - only because I'm not a big fan of the movie
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Nothing like the free one. The free one once you get to a certain point it stops, this one doesn't. Don't need internet to use the app/game at all unless you want to buy something with money like star fruit. Worth the 99&cent;. :D
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Rome is one of my favorite series!  I love having the entire collection!  I absolutely give the series 2 thumbs up
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a sad and tragic story told with humor. There were twists and turns that entertained and kept me up too late! The characters were real and could be identified with on many levels. My favorite part of the book was the postscript. Thoughtful and insightful comments on human nature.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can find a million versions of whatever crafty idea I had and then make it or keep it filed away. So organized. I love it.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This is a good book, albeit a bit difficult to read at times.  However, its definitely worth the effort to get through.  Excellent advice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun, challenging and frustrating all in one.  The bombs and chocolate are probably the most frustrating candies to beat
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Waited forever for Amazon to get this instead of bad imitations. Does not give complete list of friends to ask for help. Otherwise, completely like full version.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a lot of fun love this game everyone I know plays this .<br /> Game free on Facebook I do to I am glad that it's on my kindle know.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I can't wait for the next books. It drawed you in and I really felt part of the story. Kiera Cass does a great job playing on readers emotions. If you're a hopless romantic, like me, you'll love this book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy crush is better than Farm Ville, candy crush saga is a game to keep little ones and big ones busy and oh yeah this is coming from a ten year old
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive, fun, challenging and cute, not a big fan of micro transactions but other than that it's brilliant and enjoyable
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good, game it's very addicting , I'm always playing it on my free time, can't wait til pet rescue come out either .
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have been playing candy crush on the kindle fire for a few weeks. I enjoy playing it on my iphone more. On the kindle fire I fond the game drags and freezes often. the request counter is always indicating I have more request then there are. The game is not syncing with my Facebook account or with my other devices.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad they have it for my Kindle fire. It is very addictive game. Our whole family plays it. We love it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What a cool gadget, now we don't have to crowd around the iPad when we want to share a funny. Everyone in my house (even the kids) have found no problem with being able to use it.
B000024L0T|5.0|Annie Lennox has always been a unique talent with the melancholy voice set to a pulsating beat, but here she shines with a different take on that sound that is so much her own; on the song &#34; Why&#34; she reaches inside the listener with lyrics that anyone who has experienced a loss, can only start to tear up and by the end the tears flow. This compilation has many incredible songs like, &#34; Money Can't Buy It &#34;, &#34; Little Bird &#34; and &#34; Walking On Broken Glass &#34; that transcend the artists composition skills and are a treat for the ears!!!
B0018J2QB8|5.0|went back to watch season 1 because i had not seen it in years and it inspired me to purchase and rewatch season 2. I had totally forgot how good season 2 was. FaNtAsTiC!!
B000H2L8AC|4.0|Great cast provides suspenseful story with plot twists and terror at 2000 feet.  Unfortunately ending is a bit contrived and somewhat predictable,  Good movie all the same.  Great effects.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|I like stuff with zombies and I have no idea why. So for that the movie was ok. The story line was decent. Not a bad movie, but not a great one either
B00447G2PM|3.0|but I wish it were longer and had some other species filmed.  Great footage if you are an aquarium fan!  We've watched it a couple times and wish it were longer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I could watch theses seasons over and over. Good show . Season 3 does not disappoint. 5 stars all the way
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I liked the first two... so had to pick this one up.  Sorta wish I would have bought the 3-D set.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I have seen all the seasons a few times. But, wanted to watch the first one agian because it had been years ago since last time I saw it. It was even better than I remembered.
B004529NLG|3.0|It's an okay movie... we liked the earlier one better.  Some of the 3D is great... some of it is not... there are some scenes where the dancer is pointing at you... his arm comes out of the screen at you a little.... but it looks skinny and weird... other dance scenes are great.  If you liked the other movie, and have 3D... grab it... but if you are looking for 3D demo movies... I'd pass and pick up something else.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|I had decided before I watched season 8 to go back and watch season 1 again. Man did I mess up. Now I am rewatching them all. Season 3 is probably my favorite. Great story. and the acting is perfect. MUST SEE or SEE AGAIN

1452126577|1.0|If you have an Internet connection, it's virtually impossible to avoid seeing the infamous Grumpy Cat.  Grumpy Cat (real name: Tardar Sauce, Tard for short) has become nothing short of a phenomenon, her scowling visage inspiring the Grumpy Cat meme and a wide variety of knockoffs and parodies.  And yes, I admit to chuckling at some of the photos of her circulating the Internet, such as \\"I had fun once -- it was awful\\" or \\"There are two kinds of people in this world, and I hate both of them.\\"  Given how she's gained so much popularity, I suppose a book about her was only to be expected.<br /><br />I expected \\"Grumpy Cat: A Grumpy Book\\" to be about the life of the infamous cat and how she found sudden fame on the Internet -- did her owners start the trend, or did someone get ahold of a photo by accident and make use of it?  But this book fell short of even my average expectations, being mostly a collection of recycled memes, bad photoshops, and ridiculously simple puzzles.<br /><br />If you've seen a handful of the Grumpy Cat meme pictures online, you've basically seen all that's interesting about this book.  The publishers picked a few of the blandest Grumpy Cat pictures, put them in this book, and padded the length with badly done photoshopped pictures of Grumpy Cat crashing weddings and birthday parties, showing up on monuments such as Mount Rushmore and the Taj Mahal, and showing up at historical events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the wreck of the Titanic.  There are also grouchy \\"features\\" such as how to make the perfect frown, why Grumpy Cat hates dogs and kittens, and ways to stay grumpy all day.  These \\"features\\" are too bland to be funny, and come across more as misanthropic and cynical than anything else.  And every once in awhile there's a connect-the-dot puzzle or word search or even a quiz, though little effort has been put into any of these and the answers usually amount to \\"I don't care.\\"<br /><br />I would have enjoyed this book more had it been an actual account of how Tard found Internet fame.  We do get a precious few snippets about Tard's home life -- the other cat and the dog she shares house space with, how much Grumpy Cat hates her home state of Arizona, and the googly-eyed cactus on the front porch.  \\"Cactus\\" was probably the best part of the book, to be honest, though I did like the other shots of her home life.  Still, I'm more interested in the story behind the cat than a book full of grousing and memes copied off the Internet.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book to anyone, quite frankly.  It tells almost nothing about Grumpy Cat, it's not funny, and it's mostly a collection of miserable and cynical rumblings.  You'll find funnier and more informative Grumpy Cat material online, and for free.been an actual account of how Tard found Internet fame.

0385334206|1.0|The book i ordered and the book i received were not the same cover/art. Not a big deal, it's still the same great story. But i did order a specific cover for a reason, so i was disappointed when i received a different cover. (P.S. my star rating is NOT what i rate the book/story/vonnegut.)
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Watched this with my daughter. While she an I usually disagree when what is a \\"good\\" movie and a bad one, we agreed on this one; it sucked. Everything seemed forced with no storyline..No, just no..
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I've seen a great many reviews knocking the dialogue for the fact that it is rather truthfully contrived and 99% of teens don't talk like this in any way, shape or form. That being said, I give you what passes as real, honest dialogue by today's teenagers:<br /><br />Hazel: I've accepted that I'm going to die, but that doesn't mean it won't suck.<br />Augustus: Yeah, it's like you're trying to climb a bunch of stars but keep tripping on your way up (or whatever cheesy metaphor fits your fancy)<br /><br />We've all had feelings that we weren't able to express, feelings that we don't have the words to describe. Green took two intensely feeling teenagers and gave them the words necessary to explain the utter hopelessness and gloom that takes hold of terminally ill patients. If the dialogue were real and honest, the message would have been lost.<br /><br />I loved this book, and I respect just about any viewpoint to the contrary, but the dialogue is perfect in that the message is allowed to be told and not suffer from the lack of words those of us who aren't professional authors inherently have.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This was much different from other books I've read. I found this book very difficult to put down. The insight to Federal Prison is not at all what I was expecting.  Like most books I want to know how the story ends for all of the characters that I grew to love! Hopefully I can still find out!
