B00NRVA1LM|5|Great bulbs with great clear color for my 2008 Lexus IS250 (non-hid)<br />and Kensun is incredible with customer service!
B00DX8AOCU|5|good stuff
B00G4T6816|5|Very nice bed for our RV. We have been staying up north in our RV for the last 4 months. This mattress makes it even nicer!
B00BYH6C1E|5|Life saver! Have dropped my keys, and phone many, many times....finally decided to try this. Works perfectly.  I REALLY like the sticky thing they send with it to set on your console.  Honestly, I didn't know it was an added bonus, but am really happy with it.  Holds my phone but doesn't leave any sticky residue.  Love it!!
B000C2ZKJC|5|Great fit.
B00332GNYO|1|One side fits perfect the other side shows 1/2 rear bed panel. Terrible terrible product very upset i had other things need to work around the caps to go on my bed now I have to wait till I get new.
B00KTJ5JL2|5|These remotes are great, easy to program, comes with a small keyring for each fob.  A card with instructions on how to get to the online instructions is included, and the provided online instructions are accurate and easy to follow.  Just as a note:  for a Pontiac Grand Prix, the MALL PGM fuse is located inside the vehicle glove box, in the bottom right corner you will see a 25 fuse then two 10 fuses going up towards the windshield, the MALL PGM fuse is only the second (furthest) from the 25 fuse.  You only need to remove the 1 fuse, not both of the 10 fuses.  Also, remember that ACC position is when the top of your key is pointed towards your head, not toward the windshield.  This product is great and easy to follow, don't get lost in the youtube videos on how to do with a paperclip and clapping three times while standing on your head.
B00OAKGWNA|5|worked like it should, happy with purchase
B00CHD9QI0|5|It was fast in delivery and exactly what I want
B00U39TIV0|3|for what it costs it's not too bad some modifications
B00476434W|5|Great quality. It's metal, not plastic.  I wish I could find this quality of emblem for other schools that only come in plastic.
B00R527S6A|5|as stated, perfect fit , not a big deal installing, very good directions,
B0089LT4A4|5|Factory filter, nuff said.
B007JOVT9Q|5|This is classy hat like my car!
B00GZR490Y|1|Wrong part for my car but i returned it.
B007Y3BKNC|1|The blue light barely comes on.. I thought it would be very bright blue and its dim badly.
B00KF9180W|5|Great product for the price
B003ZQYB5G|5|it fit on my RX300  and shipping on time as promise.
B00E975MPI|5|Awesome!
B000C9FE3C|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B000X9EGFS|5|Happy with purchase. Great to have when RVing. Construction is solid.
B005PZMKZI|5|With all the negative reviews I was reluctant to buy these for my convertible Mustang. I need to buy new seats all together due to two years of a duct taped top my interior is pretty much ruined. I need a temporary cover up until I can afford new seats. For a quick fix I am shocked at how great these look. I can take the top down and not be embarrassed of the seats. They were very easy to install. Did not rip and with a few extra tucks the headrest covers look great. Just crazy how great these look and fit. So glad I took the chance and bought these.
B00IS941D2|5|Solid. Looks great.  Harder to take the old bumper off then to put this one on. Uses factory fog lights. Will have to play with the wires to get it to stretch all the way.
B004RCSLFS|1|noisey
B0085FOFXU|4|Looks great. Halo lights are not very bright, but still looks great. Farely easy to install.
B00OIPW4KM|4|Had an issue with my order. Spoke to a representative from the company who agreed to replace my item for the one I thought I ordered.<br />Happy with the outcome. Thanks
B000H2W270|4|Works as expected and meets my needs.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Fixed my issue
B003UT3S6Q|5|Amazing product for cleaning heavy brake dust from wheels. It sprays on green and turns purple when it activates with the carbon on the wheel. It removes the brake dust--but it ends up on your driveway so wet the area under the wheels for easier cleaning later. Keep in mind this is for heavy wheel dust--you won't need it for &#34;regular&#34; cleaning (like my Camry). Save this expensive stuff for nice wheels.... This is the only product that really cleans the aluminum wheels on my wife's car..
B001UC8WKM|5|Worked perfectly on a corvette c6
B00QRKFG5G|5|High quality
B0016KFX3C|1|Does not fit The 02' RSX. Do not buy for this application.
B0085NS5L0|5|Great product shipped fast
B00A66GYDA|5|Does everything the expensive ones do, without the high cost! Great product
B0027URE9G|5|This Snatch Block is a little gem! Sturdy - Big - Heavy - Strong - - - It's a real bewdy and is central to the Magic Available in Winching - Don't go off-roading w/o it. And imagine its uses around Ur property - We winched a heavy boat (not on trailer - dragging over rock and rill) up from a lower meadow to make a great looking Tomato Planter using the snatch block, a tree saver and handy trees - - well - and the winch mounted to the front of our rat rod '51 Jeep Pickup - so Ha! ~:0) VivaChas!
B00SS15EI6|4|Bag was the perfect size for our 2 week trip to Sturgis, however the straps provided were cheap and useless. We used bungee straps instead and trashed the straps provided.
B007TXXXDM|1|It was for the wrong year and won work
B000C30J0G|4|I used this belt on 2005 Corolla.  I found this belt to be slightly shorter although I managed to put it on the vehicle.  Make sure you are using special tool for belt tensioner get maximum movement to put on the replacement belt.
B00Q3CM2QY|5|An excellent unit. This is my 2nd one, I have 3 of the previous models which were also great..only this is better in that it &#34;sulfates&#34;the battery as well as maintaining a floating charge.
B00498AWI4|5|Fit 08 Dodge Ram 6.7
B00BCH51ZO|5|The brush is very soft, and works really well for wheel and running board cleaning. I would definitely buy this again.
B00YNNM2R4|5|Great buy
B00HYHW2X0|4|Just good
B009AQS5H0|5|If you are from N.O., you gotta order this. Looks very cool on my car!
B00TQ5C2A6|5|I wish they were a little more cushioned, but they allow for trimming to fit bar end weights. That's more important on this bike and I wear gloves while riding. If I didn't it would be a bigger issue and I would probably look for a compromise, but that would cost a lot more.
B00J36LP6U|5|I love it !!! Sturdy and beautiful.
B001URQU7E|3|Received the gloves yesterday. No complaints on delivery time: Thanks Amazon Prime. They are very tight. I usually wear a large glove so I ordered large motorcycle gloves. I am just starting to ride so I am not sure how they should fit. . Maybe bike gloves are supposed to be supertight? I can't comment on durabilty yet. They appear to be  fairly well made for the money.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Item came on time and works as per the description.&#34;
B00J52R3AE|3|I bought the G2 Carryout specifically to use with 2 receivers in my RV. The &#34;main&#34; outlet works great and have no problem with it whatsoever. I would give five stars if I only had one receiver. The second feed is fussy at best. It does not matter which receiver it's hooked up to it's going to act up. I have Dish as a satellite service. When running the signal test on the main, it consistently shows it has access to two satellites; 110 and 119. Sometimes it shows the HD 129 satellite but not consistently. The second feed will only show one satellite available and I assume that is the satellite the main feed is tuned into. During the day, the receiver hooked to the main satellite maintains a good signal. Every few hours, the secondary receiver will show &#34;total signal loss&#34;. This occurs without changing the channel which may cause the antenna to switch satellites. After numerous attempts at unplugging the receiver, resetting the signal and such, the only cure I have found is to unplug the satellite dish from the power source and have it go through the gyrations of reacquiring satellites. It's a pain but it seems to get my second receiver back on track.<br />Here is a critical item!! When setting up your receiver in a new location, hit the &#34;menu&#34; button and then 611 to point your satellite. Make sure you have the correct zip code for your location in all your receivers. I wasted many hours I can't get back because I failed to do this when I changed locations.
B000ABEA8M|5|I own an auto repair garage and we use this product regularly. Have had a number of transmissions that we thought were on their way to the scrap yard only to be saved by this. We now have this on subscription. Don't know why it works, but it certainly seems to.
B00GNHQOJA|5|Great quality. Great price. Love it.
B00PQZPMYI|5|Covers work great! Perfect fit
B001NQIQAG|5|Nice.
B00QZHSBCG|5|They r what i expected. Very comfortable.
B00KO3AA3U|5|Worked perfectly. Remember to set it up upon install. It is NOT plug and play lol.
B00F8U04BW|5|Wife loved it on her new fiat
B005EJGSQ2|5|Works great, heats up very fast. Only downside is it can stay on after the car is turned off. Need to develop a habit of removing the plug.
B000WJEPCI|5|We love it!  Everything we expected and more.
B000VB4X2E|2|pump failed in seven months time, Amazon is sending another free of charge for replacement.I,ll be replacing pump again
B001G7CZRM|5|Easy to install.  Good directions.
B004V9Y80Y|1|Mahle part# K31492 DBA Victor Reinz. Their die/tooling is defective. This gasket does not fit 1998 Audi A8 Quattro with 4.2 liter V8 engine code ABZ. two of the holes do not line up.Trying Elring next...... hopefully that one will line up.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Loved it! It worked really well on our 10 hr travel and gave us more space in the suv. Plus it kept everything dry and dust free.
B006DX3Y6K|5|works fine, one day shipment, hope it holds up better than the original, cheap price, it's a shame Ford did not issue a recall for this on the 08 Edge as they did 10-13s, a real bugger to put in, save yourself some time, completely remove master cylinder first, instead of trying to work around it, brakes CAN be bleed without scan tool, it takes a lot longer to bleed though.
B006GFU3VO|4|Works great
B00S75A5KA|5|When I first installed them, I thought they were not going to work. The light was unfocused and seemed dim. Plus, they shined above the cutoff line so it would be in opposing traffics eyes.<br />When I went to remove them I noticed they wiggled a little and realized that I had them clicked in, but not pushed in as far as they would go. This put the LED in a position that was not at the focal point the reflectors were designed for.<br />It is very easy to think you have them in all the way. It fooled me, and I'm an optical engineer. I design lenses for vehicle lighting, and I should have realized that the bluriness was from the LED not being where it should. It's like when you have one of those flashlights that you can turn the head and go from spot beam to flood light. All that is happening is the reflector is being moved closer or further away from the bulb. These have worked well for me since and recommend them to anyone.
B00JF7ZJRS|5|Perfect match and it folds and stores very well.
B00YVJ36FC|3|Product leaks with significant gaps. I contacted Bak industries in advance in regards to not having drainage tubes for water and and they stated, &#34;The Revolver X2 is our most watertight cover as it has no exposed hinge points which is another reason why it does not have drain tubes, it simply does not need them.&#34; I was even warned by the shop I bought from that this would leak. I like the fact that this cover is solid and when rolled up will not block out the rear window, which is why I gave it as many stars as I did. I had to use silicone to try to seal up the gaps on both sides of the bed (which I don't have a problem doing to make it more water tight). I still need to make sure I got all the leaky points.
B000IEZE0Y|5|took less than 15 minutes to put on. No problems so far. Great product!
B00PJ7RW3M|5|Got a shirt and your sticker<br />Thanks
B005DM0OC4|5|I like the feeling of my coolant being filtered. The directions were clear and the unit was easy to install.
B0085FON46|5|Perfect fit for my acura integra 94.
B00VAY68U6|4|I purchased these for my son's car to give it a face lift. They're a little difficult to install...but look sharp in the car. The only reason I'm not giving them a five is because there weren't enough clips. They should put a couple extra is all I'm saying.
B000M5YYIW|5|Good thing to have around the shop. Don't use for marine.
B004QJH91E|4|l. Good carrier  for the money. A little noisey at times but with proper loading on the return  trip noise was not as bad. Can not  give feed back  on use  in rain . Recommend rubber mat.
B00SLHLDDW|5|Perfect fit and easy to install. Cuts down on the wind considerably more than the factory one.
B00L4TF32G|5|Great product for a good price.
B0024ECBCA|5|A ok
B000FW4LLW|5|It's a nice fit for my insurance card and easy to find in my glove box.
B0041MTABS|5|High quality product. Use them on a regular basis
B0087FK172|5|Husband happy.Quality good, price good, shipped quickly! Covers his rusty fenders & truck looks so much better!
B00180JHK0|5|These fit good and came with detailed instructions with torque specs.
B001LQHTJW|5|I like what I got!!
B001KS2PYK|5|...and it wipes just fine. Enough said.
B00HXJKA7O|5|Bought this helmet through RevZilla and personally love it. The color is feirce, which is needed on trails and even on the roads. Very comfortable, love that you can buy all new inserts to change the size. Lots of ventilation. The sun visor is nice when you want to feel the wind, and if you wear glasses it comes in handy as sun glasses.
B004MDEV38|5|This hitch came inside a box with no padding, but was in overall good shape.  It even came a day earlier than first stated.  Wish they would at least bubble wrap the hitch inside the box.  As for the hitch itself, it was a perfect fit.  The only problem I had with installation was of my own doing.  I put the fish wire through the wrong hole first and the square hole spacer wound up coming off and it is still inside the frame.  Thankfully, Curt customer service was kind enough to send me a replacement, free of charge. Seems I am not the only one to do this.  The hitch matched up beautifully with the threaded frame holes and bolted right on, save for the third bolt for the driver's side frame.  A little time with WD-40 and a wire brush cleaned out the frame threads on my 2007 Odyssey, and the attachment of the four main bolts was a breeze.  The hitch looks great and functions well with the light utility trailer we pull.  This is a great option for allowing your Odyssey to pull lighter trailers or attach cargo or bike carriers.
B001T4QH3U|4|fairly comfortable. wore them on two 3 hour rides in temperatures between 50-90f(10-32C). they never were uncomfortable. however, they did get annoying after walking & sitting in them for 10 hours while attending a wsbk/motoamerica race. they began to sag a little & the hip body armor gave the sensation of having something bulky in your pocket. it was like sitting on your car keys or a fat wallet. i'm a huge fan of ATGATT, but this has me reconsidering a little. long story short(too late for that), they are recommended if you aren't going to be off of your motorbike for long periods, but awesome if you are.
B0046BFXOW|5|Good product.
B000C2WFA4|5|Fast delivery, solved some of my errors on my Jeep Wrangler
B01298Q0QS|1|This was not a match to the color of my car at all. The control of flow and layering is difficult.<br />I would not recommend this product
B00WL5RO3S|5|Very cool
B000HBM45Q|5|Excellent.
B00IX4CMM4|5|These people will do whatever it takes to make it right. Awesome products, work and fit like they claim. Looks great. Makes you want to open the doors just to look at it. Highly recommend. Small price for a great effect. Thanks for all your help.
B004WJPN2A|5|A clearish green colored lubricant that I used to apply to the back of brake pad contact points and a liberal amount on the sliding calipers. Not much else to say except it does the job, doesn't have a strong odour and is easy to apply.
B000BQK56C|2|Too thick to use for some cars/trucks
B007AUJJXM|5|good
B004KAVRNK|1|Not impressed with this bike rack. Save your money and buy a bike rack better than this.<br />Installed it on my truck's Reese hitch. Every thing about this thing is loose, and welded crooked. Even after tightening all bolts it still rocks and sways with every bump and turn.<br />And then... it is only designed to fit certain style bike framing, apparently not my 2015 Giant Stance 27.5 2 Mountain Bike.<br />The 1st time I used the bike rack... I had my bike clamped in as tight as I could get it (the black knob was turned all the way down and could not be turned any more) and still my bike fell out of the clamp, slid down the bike rack's center post and GOT DRAGGED ON THE ROAD WHILE CROSSING A BRIDGE WITH HEAVY TRAFFIC AND NO PLACE TO PULL OVER. My bike that I had for only 3 months and paid $1500 for (a big purchase for me) - scratched all to hell.
B00O2AA4IM|5|Awesome product would buy again and again
B001NZUFN8|5|it works great. It stays in places and its made of good material.
B000CPAV9I|5|Worked good. I painted all my chrome bumper using the VHT primer and this. new application but seems to have worked well.
B004ZT5ZP2|5|Excellent quality and product
B00YY7M4AO|5|What a great product.  It would have cost me over $100 at the mechanic to tell me I had a bad EGR valve.  Also a great way to monitor you engines components?  Good job guys!!!!!
B00KJ8JEAU|5|Beautiful. White lights. Everybody asking me, about the fancy bixenon.

B000FJS4ZY|1|Shift light cover and lens flew off and were lost on the highway after only four days usage.  When vehicle is at a steady 4K RPM, needle swings constantly between 3K and 6K RPM, while factory tachometer remains steady at 4K.  On day five, tach went crazy and needle pegged above 10K so shift light was on constantly in my face going to work before the sun was up.  This is the second tach from Sunpro that this has happened to. First one lasted two weeks, then a 2,200 microfarad capacitor fell off the PCB solder point and was rattling around inside.  Return process started.
B00G52H7YE|5|Fit great. OEM and included all clips which made the routing a breeze. Can't beat it.
B00192LGWO|5|Excellent product and fit. Buy here!
B002Z5RZS8|1|Absolute garbage.  The metal is like aluminum foil and dents easily. The simulated bolt heads started falling off the first time I drove with these installed.
B005U8Y792|5|Just as described.  Super fast shipping.
B004EKYB7U|1|Does NOT fit on a 2004 single cab Tacoma.
B009RL2YDO|5|Very nice quality.
B00CPANP3C|5|I loved it!!!!!
B00139YMUQ|2|Junk, didn't last a year and not very accurate/consistant.
B001GH1PU0|5|I installed this in my 1998 Nissan Frontier and it fits perfectly into the stock mounting holes for accessory switches. Two of these switches control my forward facing and read facing emergency lights for firefighting. I love the light within the switch, because it is bright enough to grab my attention if I'm accidentally driving with my lights on, but great for the fact that it looks stock, and none of my friends will get curious to flick the switch while driving down the road and scare other drivers. I plan on buying two more in the future.
B0059HJSA2|5|I have been changing my own oil for over 50 years and was in need of a new drain pan. This pan is the greatest pan I've ever owned. the roller wheels on the rear underside are just about as handy and they can be. The pan easily holds the 6 qts my Avalon gives up and is so easily re-positioned to catch the oil filter element. And it dosen't leak when it is stored upright and full of oil. I'm very happy
B000AUQPYK|5|Excellent product tein really lives up to its reputation put these on a 2004 toyota corolla with 20' rims an its Just Simply Gorgeous!!!
B010H0QV00|5|[[VIDEOID:86638854d7482cf5a86e59f394125d3d]] This is a tool that hopefully you never have to use, but if you did, it would be the best 15 bucks you've ever spent.<br />My first impression of the tool was mediocre, but after testing it out I quickly realized that its a must have item. If I had kids then I'd buy one for each of their cars for emergencies. This multi tool paired with one of DBPower's jumpstart batteries will cover all your road side needs.<br />-Product Overview-<br />. bright blue LED light operated by the slide switch<br />. decent red LED down light operated by the slide switch<br />.glass breaker that is released quickly with a button<br />.stainless saw blade<br />.pliers<br />.flat head screw driver with 1in measuring tape marks<br />.small philips head screw driver<br />.awesome large scissors<br />.tire pressure gauge that reads in PSI, BAR, KPA, KG/CM2<br /><br />All in all this product is a great buy that might just save you or a loved ones life.
B00IEKOE8M|5|For a little more than the local auto part store rotors these looked great out of the box and after a squirt of degreaser to remove the protective coating bolted right up on my 2004 Civic EX. I installed some TRW pads with these and the set made an immediate improvement in stopping ability. They do make a bit of a whirring noise like vrrrrr - just little v's nothing scary when activated.  It's when the pads cross the slots and holes and I suspect it may go away once they're broken in and any machine edges get smoothed out. The feel is very positive and easy to modulate I do most of my driving on tight and twisty southern Virginia mountain roads so these will get tested for heat dissipation and warping in due course.
B002PJXFK6|2|the floor mat and wheel cover where great!!! the seat cover however rip very easy!!
B00B9IVRCW|5|went on my camper easily and works great.
B00ODRY4EY|5|This is a awesome product! Fits great on my 2003 Cherokee. Great price as well.
B00F23BNUG|3|Nice pure white but not as bright as expected
B001KMHG5O|5|OEM Part. Haven't opened it yet but it's new in seadoo packaging and ready to be programed to your ski.
B00JVI00CU|1|Kinda liked it at first. Nice design but the clip that connects the main piece of the trash can to your car actually melted after a month. The piece was made from such flimsy thin plastic that it wouldn't keep it's shape which meant it wouldn't stay on the lip of the car door. Not going to fret over 8 dollars, but it was money wasted.
B00AKYOTQC|1|Way overpriced.  Buy from your local Nissan dealer if you can.  You'll save a ton.
B000IYRNMG|5|Super fast shipping, got them in just 2 days. Sill plates fit perfect and look amazing, only thing is that they have a smooth finish and not diamond plate like the picture shows. However I rather have them be smooth!
B001EIXQ6C|5|Worked exactly as intended and I was able to quickly get my car back on the road!  I believe it's recommended to put some pipe sealant on the threads before installing.
B00QV3X0HA|1|Lights work however, resistor was so hot it's melted through the plastic in my car and was hanging in my wheel well after mere hours of driving at night.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Purchased this for a coast to coast move and was very pleased. Drove through extreme heat and rain and contents remained dry. Bag comes fully assembled which was appreciative.
B005S0DGQ2|5|Good Quality
B00864NVGW|5|Fits PERFECT and looks so nice. Better than the carpet dash mats!
B00FAWUCMO|5|Very nice hat.. Thanks
B00BSA8SJ6|4|Works very good, it would have been nice if the pivoted in both directions instead of only one.
B00JODF3AQ|5|Got it as a gift for my husband, he rode 2,000 miles on his HD, said it made all the difference.
B009DK4XK6|3|The antenna worked and almost fit a 1999 4Runner (just needed a little tweaking) but it did not come with any directions.  Initially the install seemed simple, 3 wires black is ground, red is constant power and white is signal.  These wire designations were a drawn conclusion.  Seems straight fwd enough, especially when the OEM wiring was also a 2 wire connection with a case ground.  After many hours of research on the internet I found that when installing a universal power antenna on a vehicle with a power antenna relay module, you have to eliminate the module and splice its constant power and radio signal power directly to the 2 wires that connect to the antenna.  Some generic directions would really be helpful!
B00GSAUHB8|4|Sunshade is great, much better quality than the last one I bought ~10 years ago. Though I didn't receive any extra &#34;cool free product&#34; (the lil gripper mat thing) as was listed on the products page & description, so -1 star for false advertising or just failure to throw it in the box. Will update this review to a 5 star rating if they actually send me the gripper-mat thing- it's the principle of it.
B00Y17SHTE|3|Dont loke how it fits 2 ga wire. Too loose. Works though.
B00L5MVVDW|4|The key looks great and functions well.<br /><br />The buttons basically push a hidden OEM remote under the FOB.<br /><br />Cutting & Programming:<br />1. Had the dealership cut the key for $15.<br />2. The dealership wanted $120 to program the chip and remote.<br /> 2a. Programmed the remote buttons myself (YouTube).<br /> 2b. Took the key to an automotive locksmith for RFID Chip programming ($40).<br /><br />I was worried the chip would not be recognized by the vehicle because it's set back a bit further than the OEM key, but it works flawlessly.<br /><br />The only strange part of the key is the little round circle on the back where you would place the logo.  Honda logos are not round.
B002FUR5FG|5|Great addition to my 2011 Toyota Corolla S. It was fast and easy. Came with straightforward instructions.<br />Made the car growl right around 3k RPMs+. Couldn't have asked for anything better.
B001IH8P06|5|I purchased this rack to enable me to add a hitch-mounted bike rack to my Prius.  It's heavy steel and I have no doubt it will outlast my car.  The installation was pretty simple.  The bolt holes all matched up perfectly.  The fact this is one of the most reasonably-priced hitches on the market is the icing on the cake.
B001AV953Q|4|This a good product.  Lasts longer than 3M.
B000I1FM72|3|After using this creeper for 3 months the center wheels are coming out of the molded plastic you lay on.  I use this 3-4 times each day at work and seems a little early to break wheels. Very disappointed  in the quality. I do not know what changed with the small wheel vs large wheel versions but it's definitely  better to get the smaller wheels. Or it could be where my old small wheel version was manufactured  vs the new large wheel one.
B00Q1F7OIE|5|Good product.
B0055B0DUQ|5|I replaced the old rotors from my 2005 Highlander because when braking the steering wheel shakes.  It was easy to replace with the new ACDelco rotors.  It took a little over an hour for the entire job. I did not replace the pads and other parts because the pads were only about a year old. I have been driving with the new rotors over 500 miles now and the steering wheel no longer shakes when braking. The car also drives smoother than before. BTW my Highlander has 97K miles.
B0076AKISQ|5|I was sceptical at first in purchasing this item, but when it came in, I tried it on the car and it fits PERFECTLY and looks really nice too! For those of you wonder if it fits the 2015 Prius V, it does! Plus the shipping was fast and reliable.
B00RK3H05S|1|This axle does not fit my 2014 Polaris ranger 6x6 800 as a front right axle.
B00EHE851Q|5|excellent fit.
B00ZZEG38O|5|The device is excellent, I fixed minor problem with it, and also I have to grind the edges so that it will fit into my FJ cruiser blancs<br />In general I am happy with the device and I strognly recomend it.<br />Just you need to get it into the learning mode when you install it so that it will start communicating with the monitor !<br />The sensors battries can not be replaced, they advised that they will last for 5 years !<br />The monitor will allow you to choose the presure unit ( Bar / PSI ).<br />The monitor can report the temperature of the tires as well with a push of a button.<br />If the presure changes rapidly, it will beeb and the screen will become red !!<br />very helpful
B00C1YI2XA|4|These LEDs get very hot very quickly
B00OFOE1XY|5|Looks and works good
B00QHY8PQ4|5|Looks like it came with the bike. Great color matching and great price.
B0000AXQMF|5|Working great.
B00NFA8NRE|1|After 3 weeks both lights are out not good product wish I read the other reviews first
B00BAZCRRS|3|I like it it's not so bright
B00JVHLS3G|5|Decent replacement
B00JIJ4LWW|4|Not sure if this as UV protection... Soaks in well. States to buff after application but nothing to buff. Used on Costco leather sofas.
B0031GT3IK|5|Return was flawless like always!
B00NQ8FD1Y|4|Good wire. Feels cool and very soft and flexible.
B00MAQHRYY|5|This was after a lot of research the best solution and the support from Willwood was also awesome ..  Amazon, best price so win win for me.
B000RDG7Q6|5|Our 98 F-150 was producing a P0420 code and a check engine light.  Went ahead and installed this along with the Magnaflow 23344.  Perfect fit, restored performance and fuel economy, and cost less than replacing the cats individually or having a shop do it (plus no welding and fitting).  Overall job took just about half a day.<br /><br />Make life easy on yourself and spray the exhaust bolts and nuts with PB Blaster or other penetrant the night before to make for easy removal.  Also helps to have a tailpipe expander available to re-open the swage on the factory exhaust pipe to make the new cat-pipe slip right in for re-clamping.
B004AF33EG|4|compressor fit perfect and A/C system runs great, just like new!!! Make sure you change the filter and metering valve just around 3 bucks so worth the investment will also indicate any burn out to the system caused by compressor failure.
B0067UCM9Y|5|I purchased this to replace a piece of junk Raysbesto's hub I purchased 1 yr ago. It was installed and seems to be working very well. It is quiet and the truck handles well. I would highly recommend this hub assembly.
B00L7E80IW|2|to thin
B000CQRMAI|2|They stop but I can't stand the squeaking!
B00HSO2BC6|3|Expected the products to come in the box as shown, not wrapped in a rubber band.
B00CGNCBJM|5|Works great and keeps the goods cool on a hot day!
B002KMHHAC|5|Fit perfect. Good price.
B00FQQ1QO2|5|Perfect fit like it said
B005XRQP8G|5|This is great tail lights  fit like the original and give a new amazing look to my car ,easy to install, not need any adapter like other review say , just use the same old connectors  and work like they say ,I am very happy  if I can I give 10 stars
B00A83NDUS|5|Great!!!!!
B004YID4DY|5|Product arrived quickly, with intact sturdy packaging.  As advertised was decent quality for the price and relatively easy to install. Looks great! Would buy again!
B00UFQRB8S|5|Couldn't find a sunshade long enough to fit.  The standard ones aren't high enough for the sunvisors to even hold in place.  This one is a perfect fit.
B00QF0MY0S|5|These are very bright, not bright enough to be just headlights, but will light up the garage when in your headlight housings! Wires a bit thin, and I had some issues with blown LEDs but the seller resolved these issues perfectly. Highly recommend these! But do some testing before installing them incase they do blow out!
B009OBVS2K|5|Wow. This really works. i was doubtful but I needed something to remove hard water spots. I have never encountered such hard water issues but after the spots remained on my car for weeks, I could not remove them. This product made the removal successful !
B00BXLE2HW|4|As described replaced orginal without modification and worked properly
B00AYAICOW|5|they work so good. never had better wipers than these.
B005LTHOTK|5|Nice
B0002U2V1Y|5|Works great!  You just have to remember that a little goes a long way.  I saw a dramatic difference after doing this to my black car the first time and following with Mequires black wax.
B007TYK49M|5|It was just what I needed and was sent on time. Job well done!!!!!
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Love it. It fits perfectly in my 2008 wrangler and, while still hot inside, it makes a HUGE difference on the inside temp. It is a lot more bearable to climb into the jeep during the brutal Arizona summers.
B00PBO0Z3M|4|Great headlight set.  Just to note, these do not fit a GMC, only Silverado.
B008ROQ34I|1|Smells awful, and does absolutely no help in locking dye into leather, color just rubbbbs right off anything it touches... Was looking for a satin flexible sealer for leather, which would also help stop dye bleed,, - this is definitely not it. :(  I love things made in Wisconsin, but these Fiebings products are a major bummer.
B00495UQT2|2|On the small size but will do the job on my UTV.
B000X1E59S|5|The only oil I use in my vacuum pump.  Keeps it working efficiently.
B00SGFW4ZU|5|Good
B005RUPM1K|4|Good replacement for my broken case of my VW Jetta.
B00062ZF20|5|perfict fit on my slant six fuel pump
B009M1VO6C|5|ok
B00DTEBFH6|5|great product. easy install. looks great without any overkill.
B008F8Q9IG|5|It only took about 20 minutes to swap out these headlights plus a pair of side markers.<br />Were a perfect match an fit.<br />Crystal clear lenses made a huge difference in appearance and performance.<br />Packaged very securely in study boxes with plenty of padding.<br />I must have misread in the description, because these included the bulbs, BONUS!<br />The side markers used were also from Autodart.<br />Freshened up to look of my trusty Cavalier.
B002OJ9Y98|3|didn't need this, bought the Tekonsha kit that came with the holder even thought it said it only came with the brake controller and wiring harness, so i have an extra if i need it.
B00FSXK734|5|Perfect fit.
B00BDCE8FM|2|Very cheap material, they look fine, as long as you dont plan to functionally use them. Torn the second day. there are no anchors to hold this towel in place.
B00D6MCDWM|1|All 4 light strips arrived cracked in the middle due to being folded in half.  But what can you expect for $6?
B00LEZEFNS|4|Great price, exactly what I needed
B000VKTUQ4|5|s good as it gets, comparable to Hondas.
B001CF4UXU|4|I have not used it yet and hope I never will but it feels and looks well made for the job.
B00QIM9HS0|5|Great product fast shipping highly recommend thank you
B00SK6CK4U|2|Not the same as manufacturer part out of the 06 impala. Had to get some nuts and bolts to make it work. Hole where the window fastens is also different size, so window is a bit wobbly now.
B00U1OKCIU|5|A little slow to get these to me but still a very good seller and a GREAT product!!
B0049GHV3U|5|Awesome product. This radiator was above my expectations. Very easy to install. The only negative was the clips fell off inside box, and where hard to keep on while putting the screw in.  No big deal! I would definitely buy this product again.
B00IR90FG0|5|Fit well.
B000C5CE5M|5|These do not fail... I been using for years. If it supposedly fails, it's because your coolant has over heated for some reason or another. Better to be safe than sorry. Failed thermostat... 11 bucks. Failed engine... Priceless!
B004LQCDOA|5|👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
B000EDUUIA|5|Awesome product! I have a midsize SUV and my husband has a Chevy Silverado and we are both able to feel them as we roll up! We wanted something that would work and would also be low profile and this product meets both of those requirements! We are very happy with them and would highly recommend them!
B00HET17RK|5|works great with a bunk we converted into a loft
B002QGVW3K|5|Everything was perfect:)
B00DHQHTZI|5|Great product fit perfectly came on time will recommend to others
B000FBLSD2|4|The Canopy was packaged well and included all parts. Everything works fine, tie downs and even the zippers.  More sturdy than expected and I definitely plan to use during hunting season and snow removal.  What would be nice is if they did less folding on the windshield.  The box is big enough to keep from creasing the plastic so much if they tried. The front and rear windows do not roll up like the side windows.  Overall, a very good product for the money.
B00KAOI954|5|Great price, and it looks great.  I don't know how weather proof it will be yet, but so far so good!
B00F675VI8|5|Fit perfectly, took no time at all to put in and solved the P0010 and P0011 code in my Pontiac Solstice GXP (2.0 Turbo).
B00IS90K7I|5|greetings, I would like more information of the article, have a picture that is more visible and that includes the same.
B00V56U28I|2|I don't get it baby I was using it wrong $30 I don't think so
B00CG5RYEW|5|worked as expected<br />sticks on perfectly
B00H1IBKIK|5|just worked on my 2013 ford fusion looks better than the factory one and the dealer wanted 10 each I replaced all 20 for 20 bucks you just can't beat that
B004ME11FS|5|Very happy with this ite
B00JUI7VW8|5|I put this in my camper connected to the battery and its very convenient.  No more charging phones in the vehicle and then not having the phone in the camper when you need it.  Great inexpensive addition to my camper
B000CESE3O|5|very easy to cut , and wrap my fuel lines , cleans up the look also
B00U7PX1PY|4|I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone interested in seriously protecting floor interior.<br />The passenger does not completely Settle in the floor flat but maybe with time it will fit more securely.
B00CFSZR0S|5|So easy to use and install!
B000EDSTAG|1|We had a power outage. I wanted to use our stove and I tried to use this igniter. It did not work. I replaced the battery 2 times; still no joy.
B002R1DI8G|5|Replaced my old yellowed headlights with these. Installation was easy, there are plenty of youtube videos to show you how to do it. I was thinking about spending $30 to have someone try to clean the old ones, but new ones are always better. My truck got a nice facelift.
B00O0SRAK6|1|Round one = The red lights worked fine but the blue lights didn't work at all. They are sending out another product to try. It is evident they don't test the product before it is sent. I saw a previous post about someones blue lights not working, so either they sent me his returned item or they have a bigger problem.  Round two = Okay update I got the second set of lights in the mail two days later. And low and behold this is a pill of junk as well.  Again the red lights worked fine but the blue lights, there are 9 different heads and only one head worked. While I had it on, there are 3 LED's inside that one blue head and one of the 3 burned out in the first 30 seconds. This company doesn't belong in this business... they might want to consider being a paperweight manufacturer.
B003IHMHLW|5|easy install, good quality
B00KG14LBM|5|This is a nice cover. Thick . Good sized . It has a velcro opening on one side for fueling,etc.. also has two air slits on the back for venting wind thru it.. Used it on a 2004 Seadoo GTI Rfi waverunner and it fit with plenty of room to spare. Also because of the velcro slit in the front I can moor the waverunner on the dock with the cover on... I also use the air slit in the back to pass a hook line to the rear of the waverunner.. using that setup I can completely cover the waverunner while its docked in the water.
B00080QHMM|5|Works Perfectly
B001TYJOG2|2|These fit my seats but the black scratchy fabric attracts hair.
B00KUANFDE|1|More like a dust cloth than a fender protector.  Not worth the money.
B009KYYUJE|3|OK
B0031ZDU62|1|We purchased this product to change the coils on a 2005 Ford Expedition (5.4L), which was indicated that these would fit.  It was being installed by our friend, a ford dealership mechanic.  They do not fit!! These are angled the wrong direction for the coils.  Look for another set if you have a Ford Expedition.
B00CVFIIZG|5|Works great for MB 2007 E350 4MATIC. Excellent price too.
B000BQR100|4|Serves the purpose, keeps car much cooler. Good price.
B00GOHQAKC|5|Good Quality! IT is the BUCKEYES so you can't really go wrong with that. A+++++
B00Q0BGOQ2|4|Windshield is perfectly clear, cut right and the mounting straps are high quality. The only thing that keeps this from being a five minute install is the rubber molding. I would recommend notching it where all the bends in the windshield are before you fight with trying to get it on. It only takes a pair of side cutters, but once the molding is finally on, it will stay put without any glue needed.
B00GBBC8FW|5|Installed easily and looks great!  A &#34;no-brainer&#34; for protecting your door sill paint!
B001DIJC0W|1|The cup is cheap .I used it one time and the cup broke .If you buy this to save money you will be sorry. Spend some more money and buy a Tiger tool.
B00JJRDYQC|3|I didn't notice that the picture was of a disposable crotch-rocket. Kinda makes me wonder what the gunman is so excited about.
B000EVWDU0|5|This volt meter works great if you have concerns about how much life is left in your 12v battery.  There is a handy chart on the back to give you estimated remaining capacity.
B008O9DV78|5|OK my travel trailer is an 86 that I have had for maybe 6 months. I have had trouble with the septic since I bought it. The waste tank filled too fast, emptied too quickly, and there was often an odor inside and outside the trailer.  Somebody lent me a backwasher and I was hooked.  I could see that I was making progress, but it was still lacking.  But this product is great. I am one person and I use this every time I dump the tank. I believe there was a build up and blockage in that tank from the get-go. I have finally gotten rid of the blockage and years of neglect. I love that there is its own flush valve because I open the hose to add water and I can judge when the level is getting high in the tank by how much liquid is in the clear pipe with the valve shut. When the clear pipe is nearly filled, still showing some air space,  I open the valve and empty the tank. I don't have to worry about overflowing into the toilet or going inside to check the sensors.  One person can get the job done. This is a great item that has saved me much work, much worry and an expensive call to the mobile RV tech.
B00QRHDIPY|4|Works great!
B00BITHKNM|5|Received item quickly and looks good
B00CQ7UBC2|5|Exactly what I needed and good quality
B000C3XD90|2|Returned it. Did not look like the filter I bought in store. Did not want to take any chances.
B00A15XBJG|3|installed in 2011 e350 van.  installation easy and straightforward, but need to bungee visors up and there is a good sized gap between shelf and windshield.  also anything not bolted down on that shelf rattles a ton when you hit a bump
B00A7WIVNE|5|Fit like an OEM part.  Like it much better than the lower dash panel.  It is out of the way and I don't have to worry about accidentally hitting it when shifting gears.
B00WDSVEE8|4|These work great for biking.  They are very dark so they help supplement my darkening prescription glasses that I wear these on top of.  I like that they flip up when I get sweaty or foggy or go into the shade and they prevent my regular glasses from darkening completely.  Only thing is that I also bought a different brand of yellow colored flip shades that I like even better.  They really brighten the shade the best and take away glare in general.  I prefer the yellow ones except when it is in a super sunny location or car driving with bright sun, then these dark ones are stronger and more helpful.  Since they are so inexpensive, I can easily have both colors for different conditions.
B00589S032|5|nice lanyard
B00A195S2A|5|good stuff fit right
B003V57NUQ|1|The carrier did not have all of the holes drilled on one side of the mount. I probably could have drilled them but why?After testing out if it would work for my two man Kayak I found that the carrier did not fit at all . It was at the wrong angle putting pressure on the bottom of the kayak denting the bottom. I could not use it at any angle.It never cradled the Kayak at all. SENT IT BACK!
B007W80MEC|3|Took a lot longer than it was supposed to for shipping but looks decent on the vehicle
B000E3EXTC|1|Didn't fit the seat in my 63 Belair wagon
B00V2T8GRW|5|love my new key chain  had lots asking  about it thank you
B0040HLC9W|5|Put this on my car grill and looks much better than a plate and holder. Highly recommend even for Raven fans.
B000B5QFE4|5|The mirrors fit very well.
B00BITICRA|5|This itemwas OK and easy to install.
B000CB7DG6|5|It's OEM...
B000BPWSCC|2|Not enough sizes to fit all Holley vacuum ports.
B001U522GO|2|product size was not as described.  The bucket I received had external dimensions of about 12in tall x12.25 in diameter with the lid on.  The standard spray bottle is 11 inches tall.  With the grit guard out I still could not store a spray bottle in the bucket and put the gamma lid on.  Inside dimension with gamma lid on was about 10ins.  Nothing was broken and i would have kept the product if it matched the size in the description   Added a couple pictures.   Not the best but you can see the overall size
B001G7L2Y4|5|Be careful with the threads on your oil pan if you haven't changed the plug in a while.  Th plug itself is great.
B0013LDNEK|5|Trying it on the freeway today
B0009IQZH0|5|Received a discount in exchange for a review.
B00P48IL54|5|It was exactly what i was looking for.. I have no idea how i lost the first one but this one fit right in and i haven't had a problem with it. Just have to make sure you line it up the right direction. The only issue i had was it took 5 minutes to get it out of the adult proof package :)
B00YY7M4AO|5|I'm very happy with this so far.  It worked so well with the free version of Torque (allowing me to determine that the O2 sensor causing the CE Light was working OK and shut it off) that I purchased Torque Pro too.
B000COVMXI|5|Perfect fit for my 2005 Honda Civix EX.
B000W0RQ8C|5|I dont have any long term experience as I just received this, but it seems like a very solid lock. I have had a number of receiver locks over the years and they have all ended up crapping out on me. This one looks like it will hold up well. A side benefit is that its pretty low profile so getting the trailer cables onto the receiver wont be a PITA like they used to be on my Jeep Liberty with the old lock.
B00EDMWZZ4|3|worked good, however not very durable.
B00JH24LEI|4|Perfect fit
B00UI5DPXQ|5|Nice heavy, weighted base, good spinning top works well. You do have to tip the whole thing to empty though. Sturdy, shiny, will use outdoors but will store indoors. Best price too!
B00FV1MMOA|4|No instructions or alcholo swabs
B000DT7Y70|5|All essential pieces were in the kit. The unit appears to be of high quality manufacture and the running noise is very minimal. The vendor delivered in extremely quick fashion and there have been no problems so far. AAA+
B011U9JUAK|5|perfect
B00YVHGTBM|5|Seriously an impressive piece!  For the minor changes that I wanted to make on my '13 Audi, it was either spend $300 on the Ross Tech cable and software or $39 + $19 in the app to fully unlock the features.  This is so much more convenient and quite capable.<br /><br />Customer service with the folks at Carista is top notch!  After a few exchanges on email  I opted into the Beta program for some new features and I am happy to provide feedback in return.
B007RHX4KM|5|Fast shipping and item as described
B009F5D8WS|4|Fit very good and installed about 30 minutes on the ground.
B0044AZ426|5|Use this filter for your Toyota. On this application this filter is superior to Fram Perolator or other Big Box store Filters
B00JSAQYR6|4|I was sceptical at first. They look so flimsy and cheap but they have stood up to intensive testing and do a nice job keep my beer cold.
B00EB42HC0|3|2nd one in 3 years
B009K4DKLS|5|Very impressed with car vac. Does pick up everything the power is there. I was surprised that this handheld vac did handle so well.
B00PGQDYNI|5|Fine
B003CH577Y|5|did the job and affordable. Still works and still adheres to pads. no issues after a few uses.
B00KAHK986|5|Quality product and fast shipping
B00L4V9ECY|5|Worked great.<br /><br />Did this to a 2014 vw jetta.  Needed it for the drl and signals.  I took it out and custom made some led boards.  These worked like a charm  Removing the bulb error codes<br /><br />Just know these get hot.  Don't sit them on plastic.
B00RM327NG|4|Really works well
B007JSGR9Y|5|Works great.
B00MJU673S|5|They work. I can't tell a difference from oem.
B007JSGR9Y|3|Read the codes but gave me really no other information or suggestion on how to fix problem
B007USQWWA|5|Arrived in good condition and about $40 cheaper than the dealer's cost. Plus the installation was a breeze.  Did not have to pay the dealer another $60 to install.  Took a total of 10 minutes. Just as easy to take off.
B0093XZDS4|5|My vehicle rides bettet since I've been using Bestline!
B00BQYCKE8|5|These are perfect for between washes when you need a quick detail. Also for bugs, just make sure to always use a spray lubricant on the car so you don't scratch!!
B0002ILK4K|5|Worked out perfectly, right size, charged well and kept its charge.  My grands are back to riding their Minnie Mouse Vespa!  Happy Grandma.
B000SL4AA2|5|GOOD BACK UP INCASE OF EMERGENCY
B00027H0QI|3|fit was good but they will only last one season at best 3 months
B0093N7NTG|5|This Curt wiring is the greatest, so easy to wire up to my SUV.
B0016KABFC|5|works as expected. heavier duty than expected
B0000CBILL|5|It works great. Its red color helped visibility. It is robust and unsawable. I recommend any one to buy for their cars.
B003IDAJ0W|5|Do not cheap out on these side markers!!! If you want the clear side marker get the genuine OEM version of them. This is the only way to go! These look way better than the chrome / clear ones and have no water issues. They come with the lifted face and light bulbs / connectors. The bulbs are orange so they are street legal. 100% recommend spending the 60 and getting these vs. the cheap ones. Easy install!
B00199NPNU|5|i had to return this item because i didn't tell them what model i needed it for.
B003808EZ2|5|Good fit, slight increase in MPG.
B00EZY337E|5|Works great outside my teardrop!
B005J3ZG1Q|1|didn't work for me new wind shield here I come
B000GBD2QW|2|Advertized to fit my E24 Base. They did not and item was returned.
B00TZF06VO|4|Works great.
B00F6K10OY|5|Very sturdy, great products from KnuKonceptz
B003YN9LD2|5|Fits and functions as expected.
B00F7EA25C|5|Very nice auto emblem!
B00OLVG5IU|5|perfect fit, thick and awesome!
B000LG8GI6|4|Didn't work the first time I tried, but after going over the instructions again, it worked! Not giving it 5 stars though because the trunk button does not open the trunk. It does make a noise when that button is pushed but nothing happens, but everything else works perfectly! (Shipping was fast too! Ordered it on a Sunday, shipped Monday, got to me on Wednesday!)
B00823FSRC|2|I couldn't figure out how to attach it to my kayak and it came with no instructions. I'm still waiting for a kayak expert to drop by and help me put it to good use.
B00IA3XWAE|5|Bolted the carb on go kart runs great. Good value on the parts
B009FUF6DM|5|Holding up well but have started to curl on the edges and don't really lay flat anymore. You will probably at most get a year or two from them before they start not being so soft (even with the soft water I wash them in). I would buy them again and I believe you are getting your money worth.
B008FBRRA2|4|I bought this about two years ago and it held up very nicely! It chipped a bit but it was because of the windshield scrapper durring the winter and it just started cracking a bit but I think its because where I park the sun hits it straight on ALL summer. But for the price id say that's not so bad. And the color hasn't faded yet.
B000GKAZMW|5|Does not distort the images. The images are clear. It has wide range of vision. Excellent mirror.<br />I had one many years ago but that distorted images, objects were seen farther than they were.
B00E9FWU3W|4|Works great
B0091DJVK2|5|Well worth the purchase!
B00M3EUSKI|5|Works great, saves water,
B00029J3KM|5|I didn't buy this off amazon, but I had to do a review of it since it's so good of a product!  I put this on my 96 civic ex that before had a really ricey exhaust. I can honestly say it sounded like your typical Honda exhaust, raspy and didn't sound good. I took this to a muffler shop and the mechanic cut off my resonator (the part that made my car sound ricey) and welded this to the existing pipe. Now my car has the low deep rumble sound with no rasp or fart can sounds. This stupid little red pipe actually works!
B0022ZEKCU|5|I purchased for my husband, this is the only thing he uses to clean his vintage bikes and you can't beat the price on Amazon.
B00SVYKAVQ|5|The fit was fine
B0107WKYV0|1|Terrible process to put them on. Nasty stickers....started pealing off in the rain already.. Not worth the $9. Would of rather bought the $20+ Exactly fitted ABS plastic ones... Actually would rather want a refund.
B00GFLVRKU|1|not the correct size for my car
B00EUUNJRM|5|Great quality and super bright.
B00EDQ1FLU|4|This replaced a replacement which failed after only a few thousand miles. The entire vehicle only has about 50k on it and these are not cheap to buy and its on 3rd set up front. Also costs to install even though I did it myself. Delco should make them last longer. This is a new part number so maybe improvements were made. We'll see.
B000NVW1LM|5|Rarely do I do reviews let along give 5 stars; however, this product deserves it.  I had a differential leak on my 1983 motorcycle (shaft drive) that was dripping onto the exhaust collector; big smoke and possible fire hazard.  I put a small amount into the differential and in no time at all, the leak has ceased.
B000C9S78G|5|Perfect fit OE replacement cap for Gmc Envoy!

B002RDGMNM|5|Did couple brake jobs, every time performed excellent.  Happy with my new brake tool.

B0000AY3SR|5|Works extremely well on the plastic panels of our golf cart!
B00U35RY4M|1|terrible product, item would not hold a bottle of water, item would fall out - handles were not firm enough.  returned the item.
B00J2CI6OY|4|Thumbs up
B00XN6LLN8|3|mtg holes in running boards did not align with holes in brkt-- had to elongate holes in brkts --the running boards are great just hard to mtg
B00BCR8RS2|1|I thought these were leather...they are not!
B004GW41ZS|5|Great aesthetic addition to my Wrangler TJ
B000CGFJH6|5|Worked great
B0006I0ONY|1|The latch mechanism sticks and requires manual manipulation. Very poor quality of inner parts.  I would not recommend this particular brand.
B00AKXE2LU|1|I took these photos the moments I opened the box. Bent with the backing coming off with dust on the sticky part. The part that's exposed is no longer sticky rendering this decal useless.
B00AWYBHT2|4|Look awesome but I wish they lasted longer.
B00BV6VI12|3|I ordered the wrong unit for my vehicle but delivery was quick
B00THOF046|5|Perfect !
B009AQS4IU|5|I absolutely LOVE my license plate frame.  It is adorably cute and so well made.  Everyone who sees it tells me how pretty it is.
B00V2VF5GU|5|Lights are great .nice looking and very bright
B00FROLTCW|5|Worked perfectly as replacements for the ones I lost.
B000NCOKQK|5|I love this little box. It's works great, just as described. I love it, my bike, lawnmower, and my truck loves it also.
B000BOZVW2|5|Extremely simple to install. I should have done it sooner!!
B001EP0GU4|5|This was so easy to install with the help of my floor jack to hold one side up while working on the other side. One great Receiver.
B00KMBEMZG|5|ok
B005FRHHRM|5|These look even better than expected and arrived super fast. This is a very week done faux leather.  Supple and not too thin.
B00KTHYEAQ|5|I had to use a programming code/technique found online. The code provided did not work. Great value.
B004N63S9W|5|Best product for leather and vinyl we have used.  If in fact protects, there is not a better product on the market.
B00F22M5PO|5|same size as a normal license plate - great quality - perfect for the man cave
B00C53LNH4|5|Was very pleased. Worked great and saved me a bunch of money over dealer price
B00UMNCUWG|5|Awesome' fit's my car perfectly.
B000GZO6NG|5|Looks exactly like the stock floorboards and very easy to install.  No need to buy the official Harley part for this repair... save the money.
B0085XZANQ|1|The oil seals were too loose and the dust seals were too big to fit outer tube!
B00429YAA6|5|Tough,Good Look!
B005NLQAHS|5|No problems with the unit.  I leave it plugged-in and have no issues.  I use Torque app with a Blackberry Z30 and it updates very fast.  The digital readouts seem very responsive.  OBD2 is not a full code set as you probably know, but it helped me understand what error codes were keeping my car from passing emission-inspection.  The failure had to do with &#34;on-board tests not complete.&#34;<br /><br />With the scan tool I was able to see what tests were not complete.  I looked up the codes online and there was nothing to do but wait for a couple of sensors to finish some on-board tests during normal driving.  This was all triggered by having the battery disconnected for short time a few weeks before.  After about a week the tests showed completed and passed by the scan tool in Torque.  The car passed inspection.
B00KY0KQ14|5|My car starts again!
B0019I6CHC|3|Did not fit my 1992 Cherokee perfectly (the holes in the rubber are more narrow on the older models) but I was able to drill through the rubber in a way that made the part usable.
B0028MLYO4|5|just like originals.... Fit and finish are awesome!!!
B0009IQXFO|5|lives up to description.  love the smell of it and the suds without residue.
B00IO8IP3Y|5|Fast shipping.....Great Product
B00C7Y1DG2|5|fits great
B004GCPL0C|5|It's look like right one
B0007D5DZC|5|Good deal.  Have it on auto subscribe as a reminder when to change oil.
B00OROJUDS|5|Great look
B006FUT05U|5|works good for me
B009FUF6DM|5|Very good all purpose cloths. I use them all over the house. Good job Amazon!
B001DNQA9S|4|Worked ok but bushing holes weren't straight had to force the shackles into trucks brackets sits about 1/2&#34; lower on one side
B003H4NUK8|3|Instructions suck and on the 2nd day the rubber on the filter was already ripping. Other then that the sounds is pretty cool.
B00WRLINJU|5|These side sunshades work terrific. They make a dramatic difference in the interior temperature of the truck. Highly recommended. Easy to install and easy to remove.
B00J1DRJ74|3|Looks good but does not fit quite right
B000OZTPIY|5|high-quality
B0013REXO8|5|Easy to install. It took me about 30-45 minutes fo both. They really add to the look of my Jeep. Love them.
B00JK9PLLA|3|I love the simplicity of the design, but for some reason I could never get the negative terminal to fit tightly on the battery post. Even as tight as I could possibly get it, I could easily wiggle it back out off of the battery, which is not good because if it comes off while you're driving, you need a certain allen key to tighten it back otherwise your car will not start. I didn't have this problem with the positive version of this terminal, but keep in mind they are different sizes and you can't flip them.
B00LHB08C6|5|I'm very happy with this little decal!  It was easy to apply and is what it's suppose to be.  Perfect for car Identification is the parking lots around town.  Peel off for applying to the mirror was easy and quick.
B002N5W8Q4|5|We have had this FrigeCool in our RV fridge for about a month and it really does work. The bottles and cans do not &#34;Sweat&#34; as much, if at all. And the fridge cools noticeably cooler. For me it is a must have in a RV.
B0028Q1YMM|5|exactly like originals!!!
B0049DY5MS|5|easy installation
B000LGIRDK|5|Nice great item. Looks good with my brand new car. Im very happy.
B000A8JLIY|5|Good items!
B00TGGRMWI|5|Came on time and words was spelt right. Great!!!
B00CD2RBWS|5|They fit like a glove! Except had to work around nerf bars that are on truck,after that went on in a snap! Get it...nice flares!! Made truck look great!
B000COCUF2|5|worked perfectly
B0016IT4HA|1|When you reference this part number with let's say a 1999 GMC Jimmy 4x4 SLT with a 4.3, the charts on most sites claim this to be a direct fit.  IT IS NOT!  So the client is waiting and you the repairman is looking less than competent.  After fishing through holes, under carpet, over and back around a transfer case; it is discovered that this &#34;AC Delco&#34; part is too long and will not apply to the critical stand offs and brackets.  The true part number for this issue is 15189203 NOT 15189198.  I do not like wasting my time and especially time of others that I am trying to help.  Now what?  BY THE WAY  I GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE REAL AC DELCO.  THE PERSON SELLING THESE IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH AC DELCO, THEY MERELY MADE &#34;AC DELCO&#34; THEIR NAME ON AMAZON!
B001G8AIMU|5|great for ammo can project
B00YUWECYO|5|Awesome
B001UMZ07A|5|Great for Black Cars , but wear gloves for sure and have 5 or 6 clean rags to do it right. Takes 2 to 3 hours to complete.
B00DSR015Q|5|These little fuses arrived quick, well packed, &exactly as described. I needed  fuses to replace the 1 A ones that came in a cigarette lighter plug that was part of a 12 V extension cord.<br />  Actually, a 15A slow blow type fuse would have been better, but I couldn't find them in this dimension, so I opted for the 30A.fast blow. I'm using them on a home made mobility scooter lift. The motor only draws only a small amount of current, but a DC motor is almost a direct short at the instant it's 1st energized.<br />  I already had a 15A conventional auto fuse up by the motor. I didn't even know the plug had a fuse until the 1A one blew the 3rd time I used my lift.<br />Now I'm double protected.
B00G0OORR2|5|This item is very good.
B00K58WFMS|5|Looks stock need to get painted
B000IYROJ8|1|Item was absent of air bleed hole as shown in picture of item.  Has general appearance of counterfeit item.  Buyer Beware.
B0002NUNKW|5|I have a lot of spray waxes, polishes, etc.  this is my new favorite.  Yes, I don't buy the $100+ waxes, so for the price, 3M quick wax detailer rocks!  It really brings out the shine in my car.  It's like glass.  Spray on and make sure you buff with micro fiber and your great to go.  I have been trying different paste and spray waxes for my new (new to me) 2008 Mustang and this one is my new favorite.  Give it a try.
B000P0ZJIS|3|I bought this on the recommendation of a Youtube mechanic's video review. In the video he demonstrates how to use the Lisle tool and how quickly it removes or installs the keepers. However from my experience, after removing the keepers from just a few valves I noticed the tool deforming at the working end of the silver bit. I continued on. It was easy to use and quick at removing the keepers. The trouble came when I put the tool back together and put it in the case. The deformation on the silver part made putting it back together difficult.I had to ream out the deformed metal before putting it together. So much for heavy duty. Minus one star. Installing the keepers on my cylinder head was a whole different problem. This tool would be fine for use on keepers with a single groove as demonstrated in the Youtube video. If you have more than a single groove on the valve stem this tool will not work. I was working on a head with three-groove keepers. The keepers will catch on the first groove and not seat properly. Try all you like, but this tool is not going to work in that instance. Minus another star. I ended up buying the OTC 4572 and though it was slow-going, in the end I had proper control and was very easily able to complete the job.
B00BFUG6JS|4|I really like this product. The ability to use it on anything from wheels and tires to leather interior is a huge plus. I've had really good luck using this on wheels and tires, light bug and tar removal, and it even took chewing gum off that was stuck to my running boards and paint/wheels. It does have a chemical smell. My only complaint is ... its expensive. If the price was lower, its a solid 5 stars.
B00KV8U20O|4|installation was easy. brighter than the ones in there as i compared when one installed vs factory..wish it was a little brighter tho..
B00569CPLC|5|What can I say, other than It worked.
B008QRA6CG|5|Fit very well, I ordered same size as my HJC modular. The draft collar is very comfortable and the earstraps do not get in the way. Great for hot weather riding, and in city traffic I can hear cars a lot better than in the ful face modular. The old-school motor officer look is a bonus, and helps clear traffic in front of me.
B010JRL2MS|5|Ordered  this wonderful Set; love the style, love the FIT (get it, FIT).  The style looks really good on the 2015 Fit body style.  A touch of class plus they are a working tool for me.<br /><br />Delivery of this product was absolutely Stellar.  I ordered them on Friday.  They must have been delivered Saturday because when I let the dogs out Sunday a.m., the shipment was there.<br /><br />Extremely happy with every aspect of this order.
B00CQ43HG2|5|First set installed, and the driver's side low beam didn't work. Amazon made it right, and I got a replacement quickly. Now I have two working lights, and they look great. Much better than stock!
B00C8CD6KO|5|Great ......great helmet.. great price!!!!!!!
B00TKNUCVU|5|Lower voltage and brighter than incandescent lights. I replaced every incandescent light in my 43 foot Jayco Recon Toyhauler. Wish I had done this a year ago! The incandescent lights draw so much current and get so hot, my wiring harness and toggle switch were damaged - this problem is solved with the LEDs. Excellent price coupled with the promise of the LED lighting 10x longevity made this switch a no brainer! I'm looking forward to the years of bright, cool service!
B002MA55Z6|1|There's a lot of cab noise with this muffler on my 2015 6.0 liter crew cab chevy. Almost to the point of buying a different muffler for my truck
B000H0QR9G|4|Definitely worth the money so far.  You do not have to upgrade your wiring harness like one of the other reviews says too.  Put the bulbs in and your good.  Both these and the stock bulbs are 12 volts and they blow the stock bulbs out of the water.  If you want to see at night I would suggest them.
B000C17G4U|4|Just great.
B002S8BU92|3|Love the theme and color, the truck covers did not my seats. When purchasing  I did choose the option  for truck.
B006W5AK2U|4|Well made hat.
B002YKHABG|5|I use these everyday on our ambulance squad. I have never had any issue with breaking or leaking. They are thick and comfortable!
B0009PI13E|3|OK, to use getting in, but to far under rocker panel to use getting out.
B002ETK6KO|5|Easy to install. Hooks up to uhaul trailer light connector with ease.
B0023VIVCS|4|Perfect fit and pretty good price.  Wasn't wired correctly, but I fixed it easily by swapping in my old harness.
B002LNLXY6|2|Shipping was fast and product in great condition on arrival. However, disappointed that this is not a true leather smell but has some unpleasant chemical undertones. Bought this based on other reviews as I was looking for a new leather seats, boots, saddle type smell for house and car. Everyone's nose is different! I prefer Chemical Guys spray so will be buying that in the future.
B00NIXMPK4|3|The jacket is comfortable, the foam feels like it will provide adequate abrasion protection and the exterior plastic will keep my skin where it's supposed to be. All in all, I'll say it'll do. The exterior elbow armor was shifted closer to the body on one side so the sleeve feels a little rotated...though the Velcro straps tighten everything up nicely. The seams were a little messy, but strong. It lost a star for the elbow pad, and another for overall quality. If you're looking for an extra jacket for the occasional passenger, or just don't have the funds for something better...this will work. Otherwise...don't bother.
B002LGEMOQ|5|So far so good, will start and run my campers 9k BTU A/C unit no problem...
B0002U2V1Y|5|It's a great clay bar, but I haven't noticed much of a difference between it and other clay bars (Clay Magic, Griots, Mequiars). I get a extremely smooth surface after using this one or others mentioned. When its on sale from the $10 to $12 range, its very hard to beat for the price.
B00F23BNUG|5|I used these to replace the anemic headlamps on my John Deere lawn tractor.  Much brighter and draw virtually no power.  I've had them installed for over a year and have had no problems.  They certainly made plowing snow easier last winter.
B006B20BAK|5|All the gaskets and O-rings I needed, plus some I didn't (for other model years). Everything fit perfectly-no leaks.
B00KXP9GQG|4|Color matched well but not as easy to use as expected
B000AA4RWM|5|These are just what we wanted....great quality for the price!
B003LJKQ6U|5|I bough this filter after my 1 year old Suzuki started smelling really bad every time I turn on the air. My husband suggested we need to change the air filter. And so we did....My car smells nice and clean ever since I installed this filter.
B000CSPDE8|2|Very disappointed in product nothing like the description on Amazon nothing like described glue came loose after 2 days cleaned truck like instructions before installing
B00QKR2HQM|5|very happy with it
B000IYAAYO|5|Clings very well to curvy windshield of CX-7.  Wipes well.  Longevity TBD.
B000JUXGK2|4|Prompt delivery, easy install, engine runs well.
B000ELR954|5|good fit works great no noise and no more battery or charging light staying on shipped on time and great price .
B008Y1XU0O|5|You will not go wrong dealing with these folks.
B00MTKDW18|4|Looks like anticipated (see photos for before and after).  I'm pleased. Very easy to install. Just pull off tape cover stuff and stick on. Time will tell if they stay on but they feel very secure. Only downside was price (although looks like price might be going down). They are really just plastic pieces and frankly should not cost that much. But hey, it's a jeep!
B003YMPQZK|5|They are made of steel and they stop my truck...enough said. Fit perfectly on my 08 Dodge Ram 2500
B0036E9VB6|5|We keep this in the trunk in case of emergency. It's the most powerful inflator I could find that plugs into a cigarette lighter-style power port. There are stronger units available, but they require clipping to the battery terminals. I did a lot of research and spoke to several manufacturers before selecting this inflator, and I'm happy with it.
B007YJPVUY|1|POS, the paint on the plate started cracking and peeling off after 2wks. I am ordering another retiree plate from another vendor
B00JSCOQME|1|DO NOT BUY THIS LIGHT. The most important part of this type of light are the magnets, and they are cheap junk. I had it for approx two weeks and the magnets became loose and dislodged by me pooling on it to take off the roof on my truck. The magnet plate consist of a series of small magnets not one big one. That being said the series of magnets are being held in place by epoxy in this plate and come loose with very little effort. I did call the manufacturer to replace it. They gave me a hard time and said they have never herd of this before, and I would have had to return the item back first with forms filled out which I had to look for and find my self on some type of return policy THEY DID NOT MAKE IT EASY ON ME. They also say it resist water, not true.  I do need and use this light for work. I did not have the luxury of returning it back and wait wks. I could not go with out it. I had to fix it my self by using  old magnets from old broken lights I had in the shop for spare parts. I would imagine, I not the only one who has had this problem. For the light part so far so good.
B001AX65QO|3|ok
B00L2OPGBQ|5|Genuine Subaru parts but cheaper to get at Amazon what more I can say!
B000C9Y0GO|5|Fit my 1992 Jeep Cherokee well.  I have been using it for over a year without any problems.
B00E0174AO|5|Love the vest, lots of compliments. Just wish I new the waist is really tight.<br />I am 6' 175 pounds with a 34&#34; waist. The vest is so tight it rides up and there in no way to conceal carry in waist band with this vest
B003DKYTHE|4|These are super nice and I love the way they feel. Very nice in these days of plastic autos. Marked 4 stars out of 5 for no hole for the light.
B00523AMBC|1|day one, filter blew out and charcoal granules clogged every damn thing. I will try one more but will go with Culligan if the next one craps out. Seems like things I get here are seconds or junky sometimes.
B000B66UU2|1|The knurling on the brass insert pulled right out of the door handle when fastening down the bolt but I made it work  with some rigging up... should be a metal door handle rather than plastic or resin mold people use a lot of force tugging on that handle regularly if I wouldn't have pulled the knurling out it would have eventually broken anyway probably due to repeated use. I'm Not satified with the quality of this part.
B003FID1NW|1|can't get it to work on my 2000 chev. Impala
B00445L290|3|good for car cleaning, good suction
B00PXXHJDA|1|Does not fit 1 1/4 inch bars. Will not fit suzuki boulevard crash bar or frame.
B00H3ZCR2E|5|Liner fits perfectly and protects carpet
B007CDYXHE|5|have been using these in our bmw with 3 litre  with no problem.
B009XOZD74|5|Just received my mask today, sooner then expected. I LOVE IT,can't wait to wear it on our motorcycle trip to main next week. Thank you.
B00LHNZBA8|5|Fit great look amazing on the bike. And great price
B000FQ08QK|5|These fit perfectly and work great. Beware: these do not fit ABS models. The axle shaft has a bigger knuckle that doesn't fit inside the housing. Keep this in mind if you use spare axle shafts from the junkyard.
B00SZK2C7Q|4|One is fine, the other one is maybe 35% power.  I swapped out housings, it's the bulb.  Will return, hope it's quick, because the nose of the car has to partially come apart to do this, and I don't want to put it back together just to take it back apart.  Wish they were brighter, but I think the projector design of this particular lamp lens is just mediocre.  edit:  OPT7 was lightning quick in taking care of the mostly dead one.  The beam they throw is a little odd, but I use these for marker lights, anyway, so bumping my review to 4 stars.  The company knows how to make a customer happy if there's a problem!
B0011YTZAU|4|It was what I wanted and appears to be working.
B005Q13BI6|3|It's cheaper than buying it from a store. It worked with my UPS for couple of days and then it started beeping again. I don't know if it's the battery or my UPS since my UPS is pretty old, but worked fine with multiple battery replacements from Radioshack and Batteries Plus. I'm waiting to buy a new UPS to see if this battery was the problem. I'll update this review if it in fact does work.
B0094X3XW6|5|The real deal, and therefore exactly what I was looking for.
B009GNLG3M|5|Genuine product, fits well for Subary XV, Impreza
B004UIUIGO|5|good
B00316GPNQ|5|Love it
B0010GFW88|5|Worked perfectly.  Perfect  replacement  for gmc acadia 08.  If you have no sound from radio, no noise from turn signals or interior  chimes.  This is the replacement  part.  Get the band aids out and the Tylenol  if you install  it yourself.
B00RZWU8ZI|5|Perfect fit!
B006UH5V2Y|5|Product was exactly advertised.  Delivery time was great.  Product works fine !!
B00FXAJ9YK|1|Big waste money installed using the directions & they kept falling off
B004VXJFG2|4|Met expectation.
B009W7VGUA|5|Great!
B0013C9I8Y|5|Fit great on my 2011 wrangler unlimited and look even better!
B00SYFSB8Q|2|These really suck.  The only reason they didn't get one star, is because they actually work, now that they're broke in.<br />I've never had to &#34;break in&#34; a set of rocker arms before.  Very poor casting, and no machining what so ever.
B004P5MWFC|5|Does just what it says. Tape output on stereo drove wireless bluetooth speaker transmitter to distortion. Lowered level so signal to bluetooth transmitter reduced to appropriate levels.
B005HIO9KM|3|The wiring is reversed, up button makes window go down and visa-versa.  At least it works.
B00063ZPTC|3|Not happy with how many missing pieces this came without
B00D3298A0|5|Great product
B00EC8Y25A|1|Worst headlights they are so dim i cant see 5 feet infront of me on low when im driving and the halos(dim too) didnt even come with the same headlight wiring so i had  to sauter the wires from the halos to the headlight wires.  DO NOT GET THESE HEADLIGHTS
B0020YARMA|5|Does what its supposed to do!!!
B00FV1BOH6|5|Ok, good sticker fast shipping
B000JIND4S|4|Works well.
B009DJSOGQ|5|Fit perfectly
B00BD9RC8A|5|good fit
B00MXV6SVE|1|They were broken when i recieved them.
B000BRGAJ2|5|Love it! No more overheating and having to turn my heat on to cool the engine in the middle of the summer sun! YES!
B00W772DU4|5|Exactly what I needed and got here in less than a week I'm satisfied.
B00470GOLI|4|I liked them. I have big hands just wish they were just a little longer.
B003BZ9LP6|5|If you love that deep tone rumble, you'll love these mufflers. Has been known to set off a few car alarms in close proximity when I crank my truck.
B0027IAQ3O|5|satisfied to the full extent
B00MYF7ZZC|5|Terrific item!
B000CHGIFM|5|Fits perfect.
B00RJB8YIS|5|Fits perfectly! & you can't beat that price!
B000CJB1AW|5|Original Denso product, fast and good value.
B00JJZ2H9O|1|Wrong parts did not fit my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee
B006AQVHNM|5|excellent
B000N9PRKG|5|Worked for us
B00IFTFEIQ|5|Really nice product.  Fit, finish is superb.  This is my third Bestem CF piece for my MTS 1200 and this one is spot on perfect at a good price.  Wind  hits me right at the face shield with no buffeting.  I'm  6'2&#34; with 34&#34; inseam.  The inside of this shield is smooth and finished to a decent level.  The face of this shield has a perfect finish, but time will tell how it holds up to the sun and heat.  So far, very happy with this and their sport rear tire hugger.
B004INCV3Y|5|Took a some time to install but fit my Ford 2012 Sport Edge perfect! Love it!
B00F9EEI14|5|AAAA+++++
B00H90NL4G|5|They are D-rings... Heaven duty...
B002TS4Z98|5|Fit and labeled my recycling dedicated trash can perfectly.
B00QLZTHPC|5|Excelent
B00P45MOM8|5|Fit great, looks good.  Didn't notice any difference in road noise.
B00BQJSF7E|5|Have not tested but works as advertised.
B0018EUNW2|5|What an excellent product.  It's far more than a &#34;sissy bar bag&#34;, this is a quality piece of luggage.  Outstanding!
B0079GPYA4|5|I could not get the fuel tank on my Honda Odyssey to seal completely. The check engine light kept coming on. This little tool did the trick.
B00LB0OXCE|4|Worked great on my 2009 Goldwing hitch that held my hitch rack
B00PT18QAQ|5|A good, solid air gauge that's easy to read and easy to find in your tool box.  I like it!
B00CLUGXFI|5|Good stuff<br /><br />......but really stinks?!?!??!?!?!?!?
B00KTJ4KFS|1|Already broke in a couple of weeks
B001DKQZ9Q|1|Two out of the three pumps I ordered didn't work right out of the box. By didn't work, I mean they simply didn't pump fluid.  The third worked to a degree, but leaked like mad.  Wast of money.  Go with Plews.  Their product worked as advertised.
B005VNWFP4|5|Worked and fit as expected.
B006MX7Z5M|3|Front seats are good but the rear seat is a little skimpy. I know it has to fit a number of models but the straps are all visible from the cargo and rear hatch so it look like sloppy bra straps.
B0009U7Y2I|3|Washed the car as I expected soap to.  Not very high expectations, so this exceeded them.  No film left behind which is a plus.
B00WED1GOK|1|Ripped after trips on my spare....save your money...don't buy this piece of %@&#
B000OEDQQW|1|Don't use on a windshield.  Scratched my glass.  Use a better blade.
B0031ZDU62|3|After 4,000 miles still have no problems. If you are buying coil packs, USE DIELECTRIC GREASE!!!! You will not have a proper connection with your spark plugs, if don't use the grease. April 26th, 2016 Had to replace four of them due to them dying on me, for the price it wasn't too bad to get close to a year out of them. Bought a set of 8 performance coils instead.
B00946D1DO|4|was delivered quicker than promised.  part was correct one, works perfect. good job.
B00HYIETU8|5|Great product and service!
B001FNK0PQ|5|Best deal ever on amazon
B000CO88C6|1|Don't fit anything.
B00KTHYCEO|1|was NOT able to program. DOES not work
B001I9JKEY|4|The visors fit my vehicle great. The only knock on this product is that the double sided sticky tape didn't cover all of the exposed area so I have a leak when it rains. Easy fix so not an issue.
B008CE0W5Y|5|Bought this kit for a 10 foot utility trailer that had broken lights. You get the 2 rear lights, 2 side marker lights, FULL length wiring with a new plug and plus a new tow vehicle 4 way pigtail. Wired everything up and it looks and works great. These are led lights so they are brighter, last longer and draw less power. Good buy
B00M1BBUCI|5|Worked well in 2008 honda accord sedan(reflector housing) fyi even with the fans, they will get too hot to touch
B00CR3RXTO|4|So as an owner of two Saab 9-3 convertibles, I have stumbled upon the common problem of low oil pressure. The low oil pressure is due to sludge buildup from extended oil change intervals and blah blah blah you get the point.<br /><br />Anyway, I dropped the oil pan and cleaned out all sludge from the pickup screen and everything else. The recommended fix. I still had an oil light after that.<br /><br />This was my attempt to clean out residual sludge that had been leftover in the rest of the engine.<br /><br />I did a test to see how well it actually cleaned. This is how it went.<br /><br />I had my engine oil in it (the old oil that needed changed) and I added 1/3 of a can of seafoam to that oil. Seafoam is a less aggressive but very effective additive. After 50 miles of running that, I drained the oil and changed the oil filter.<br /><br />I then put cheap, conventional oil into the engine, with a brand new oil filter. Ran that for less than 5 miles just to get it warm. Performed liqui-moly engine flush with that oil. Came out decently dirty. I have seen dirtier, but this was very dirty for 5 mile old oil.<br />The proof is there. The oil came out much dirtier than expected for 5 mile old oil.<br /><br />For those who care about the pressure, read on.<br /><br />Before the engine flush, I read about 12 psi at idle. (5w-30)<br />During the engine flush, it remained relatively unchanged. About 15 psi. (10w-30)<br />After engine flush, I now read 20 psi at idle. (10w-40)<br />The boosted pressure could be from the extra cleaning that the flush did, or it could just be from the slightly heavier oil. Who knows. All I know is, the oil came out dirty, and I have sufficient oil pressure. That's enough for me to recommend it.
B001TI5IIQ|1|Product did not work
B00XCANO4O|1|Very bad gauge .The first one the air valve leaked .The second one the air release valve popped off. .They say it is heavy duty and didn't last one day of use. I will never buy this gauge again. I am a heavy duty diesel mechanic.
B003AONL4A|5|That is a product fit just right
B003X9TLUK|5|works great thank you!!
B00590WDL0|5|Fit our 2015 Armada perfectly and the wiring was also correct. I had to order this  because my mirror was stolen in Maui.
B00ZSZYWJ2|5|Super Bright, Perfect size for my two map lights.  Quick shipping from a US Seller.  The universal connectors(3 different types) makes it easy to use these wherever I choose if I wanted to move them to another place in my car.  Bright White color.  Well made, quality product.
B001544JKW|5|This is a single bearing and race...
B002R0J3Q8|5|It was a perfect match and the price was great considering the speed and convenience of ordering on.<br /><br />Lll<br /><br />It was great!!!!!!
B006L9AY6O|5|Looks great just liked described.
B00BLV6Q0U|1|This is a dorman part that showed up that was jacked up on price.was returned. Dorman doesn't fit rite and doesn't last
B00PSRORH2|4|I love the shade and received soooo many compliments on how cute it is and my daughter sings to the animals 😀
B0000AXNMO|5|Because of the intense rain we have been getting in Florida this year, rain x has been great to have. Keeps the windows clear and not just having the wipers on full blast,
B000A8OK6C|1|CHEAP
B0002KO1TY|4|Sent these to my nephew to fix his mom's car. He said they are very good quality. Got him to the next phase of the repair smoothly. Delivery was a day later than promised, so delayed the repair.
B006N95XMM|5|Fit my 99 blazer, solved all my steering issues. I did all the steering and alignment myself. too easy and the shop wanted over $800 for less than $100 in parts and about 4 hours of work. I will never pay a mechanic to work on my vehicles.
B00133L17O|5|Will this fit on a 2006 chevy silverado lt 5.3?
B00B9F79H2|5|Good
B00ELHNM3K|5|I have a Generac natural gas generator that requires 5w30 full synthetic. Although it only take 1.9 quarts, the price of this oil was so good I couldn't pass it up. I now have enough for 4 years of generator maintenance and oil changes. It is very easy to pour as well as the spout sticks out.
B002EA0ZO0|5|Perfect fitment on a 2006 STi. I have definitely noticed the interior is significantly cooler, sitting out in the summer sun.
B00DW6RJIK|3|My mom bought me these got em n today n they dnt fit very well n my 2015 charger. Sucks cuz they r so cute n the front seats fit great.
B00GS3KCC4|5|They warm up the lights very quickly, and there is no flicker whatsoever. As long as you buy some good bulbs and make sure you get the right wattage, these are perfect.
B0009IQY3U|5|Outstanding
B00LTHWLUU|5|Super happy,love it,fast shipping ,will buy again from seller
B003YBRM76|5|Perfect blend of tone and low end, quieter than previous system on another 5.3, but also seems more &#34;throaty&#34; at lower rpms... very satisfied with system, directions and supplied parts.
B003TY0F2W|5|good price
B004JB7E2I|5|They even came assembled in the loom, plus they are already numbered.<br />Great price too.
B0009TAOBC|4|Good
B001NZUFBU|2|I ordered this valve on July 29, 2015. When it arrived, and I opened the package to find the manufactures box damaged and taped together. On inspection of the valve, I found that it had been used, with obvious marks where the bolts had been tightened. I will return it tomorrow..
B00BAZBYTU|1|Not feelin it
B003NBFKDK|5|Just got it today. Easy to put together. Seems sturdy. Only wish there's more reflector, but not a biggy as i can get that fairly anywhere for a fairly price. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get extra room for either luggage or camping stuffs. It works well with my pathfinder. Comes earlier than projected!
B001TNFF0W|5|Was a great buy! It helped with hualing the travel trailer for camping.  It arrived on time. I would recommend this seller and product.
B00MG687JW|5|Full disclosure: I have nothing to gain from this review and bought the Nekteck at the same price everyone else pays. I own a full-size pickup and tested the unit out by completely disconnecting the truck battery and connecting the Nekteck directly to the vehicle's battery cables instead. The Nekteck, even on only 3/4 of a charge, started the truck twice in a row on only its own power, and I'm sure I could've done it at least twice more on that charge. Impressed enough that I came here to write a positive review.<br /><br />I was initially interested in the Nekteck as a emergency backup for the truck, but I'll admit I was a little skeptical at first. Took me a week of going back and forth before I decided to take the plunge. Glad I did.<br /><br />Let's start with the very straightforward jump-starting procedure (my own wording, written out on a card to keep with the unit in my glove box):<br />1. With the vehicle's ignition in the OFF position, connect the Nekteck's jumper cables to the corresponding cables/posts of the dead car's battery.<br />2. Plug the other end of the Nekteck's jumper cables into the Nekteck.<br />3. Turn on the Nekteck by first setting the switch to the ON position and then pressing the little round black power button. You'll see the blue LED charge indicator lights turn on.<br />4. Get in the car and start it up.<br />5. Remove the Nekteck jumper cables from the car's battery within 30 seconds of starting the car.<br /><br />As a truck owner, I chose the Nekteck over its competitors due to the listed amperage rating, which at 600 amps peak, is high enough to start even many diesel motors -- something that really sets this unit apart from the vast majority of its competitors. Can't vouch for the accuracy of the rating as I have no way of measuring, but it was certainly enough for my truck twice in a row.<br /><br />Compared to the older, more mainstream large lead-acid jumper packs, the Nekteck has some very advantageous features. It's size and weight make it VERY portable, so that it fits in your glovebox, backpack, laptop bag, suitcase, etc. -- and will save you money on gas over time gas (being about one tenth the weight -- adding less pollution to the air we all have to share), spare you a good amount of trunk space, and perhaps even accompany you on flights to be used as an in-flight charger + backup for your rental once you get to your destination. It also has modern reverse polarity protection to keep those who make a cable-switching mistake or simply don't know what they're doing from frying their vehicle's computer or the portable jumper pack.  It'll also hold its charge for MUCH longer than those heavy, so-called portable jump-starter packs, being lithium-ion instead of lead acid.<br /><br />However, many who aren't interested in it's vehicle-starting abilities will probably find this little unit to be a great buy just for its everyday versatility. It's come in extremely handy for powering/charging my phone/laptop/other electronics through built-in USB and DC-out ports. On long-distance flights (14+ hours) with small children, it's been a lifesaver by simultaneously powering cartoon-loaded tablets and dad's laptop while charging the older ones' phones.<br /><br />Can't tell how long it will last, but for the 6 weeks I've had it, its been flawless. Only gripe I've had is the poorly written/translated directions, but I found them to be clear enough to figure out the various functions and suspect most others will too.
B00B8YZEK8|5|Item as described
B008DX7OFU|5|excellent
B001AD6T24|5|This bag gives my Harley a slimmer but more capacity than the other brands, the expansion feature is such a plus. On a recent trip I was able to pack most everything needed and more. GREAT BAG!
B000H2W270|1|Not range, never use
B00B5OB7O8|5|Installed them in my boat. Works great.
B008X02HVY|4|Installed easily and quickly. Glad to see the Camry sitting higher off the ground.
B00J4P4TEK|5|Exactly as described.  Perfect fit, (2011 Ranger) look great.
B001V2XKJ4|5|soo cute! easy to apply
B012MZGKOU|5|This is a very convenient little gadget that came in handy for me recently! I've had my check engine light on for the past few months, my local garage just over charged triple what my repair cost so I left upset and never even asked about the light. Using this I was able to figure out the problem in minutes then take it to another garage to get my problem fixed after I called around for prices first! I'm so happy I have this in my handy dandy tool box now! It's already save me money!
B000BXOFJI|5|Best product of its type I have used
B00G0PJNKW|5|Save yourself some money by changing your own Acura engine air filter and cabin air filter. No reason to give the dealer $100 to have either of these replaced. I'm not mechanically inclined but changing these was a piece of cake. The OEM Acura engine air filter was priced fairly and shipped quickly. It's an Acura part and fits perfectly.
B00HJVEWVG|5|This product restored compression in my high mileage Dodge Neon. Drove 150 miles after adding and noticed a big difference in how the engine was running. Verified with compression test. If you have a car or truck with low compression this might work for you. I was/am pleasantly surprised.
B002E4ZY6K|5|good
B00BCRMAAS|3|I purchased these for my husband to use in his 2005 Toyota Tacoma, SR5 4 door pick-up truck.  The seat covers were lightweight but not too flimsy and appear to be made of quality material.  The seat covers have a velour type texture to them. The backs to the front bucket seats work great, the steering wheel cover fit perfectly and so do the head rest.  The seat belt covers are fine. The bottoms to the bucket seats however didn't work so well with this model.  The universal fit doesn't seem to be compatible with the model truck we have.  He could have made them fit with some modifications but he choose not to because he didn't want to ruin the integrity of the vehicle.  Also, we couldn't use the covers for the rear seat because it is a 60/40 split.  With storage areas underneath and behind the seats.  The seat covers will fit but you will lose all access to the storage areas without removing the covers.  For the average working man that is just too much of a hassle to get to tools and stored items.  We really liked the product itself however it didn't work so well for our vehicle.  For the price this is a great deal if it works well for you model car or truck.  We feel like this is a really good product it just wasn't right for our needs for our vehicle.<br /><br />**Update These have since started unraveling and falling apart.  Some of the covers fit so loosely that it was just more convenient to take them completely off.  I have adjusted my rating from 4 stars to 3 due to the fact that they just haven't held up well.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion and review.
B00B09ITUI|3|Ordered for my brother it fit him okay but was kinda tight... Glove is also thin won't offer much protection from a fall...but they are stylish.
B000E4RXN4|4|Item was OK but they should attach screws beaucouse the the tread doesn't match the original screws.
B003O4S6B4|5|Lights are nice and bright and are just as described. They don't stick real well with the self stick adhesive so I would suggest using clear Silicone to attach them. Would definitely buy more if I end up needing them. And they are super cheap and look just as good as the expensive sets. Very pleased with this purchase.
B00NEL7NY8|3|The product is what it is BUT do you really need this?  Not sure it's worth the cost considering we are talking about a cabin air filter that even by their own documents should last 15K before needing any sort of cleaning.  In hindsight, I probably would not have purchased this BUT I do like the filter itself as the store bought types are way too expensive for what they are...nothing but a cheapo air filter.  The freshener.....I still am not sure what it is supposed to do.  I guess it's supposed to &#34;neutralize odors&#34; but who knows with these things.  I was expecting more of a fresh scent from the blower but I get a brief odor of what smells like clay or playdough or something and then disappears...maybe that's the filter charcoal or whatever is in it....hard to tell.  The filter itself DOES make a difference but as far as these &#34;cleaners & fresheners&#34;---a bit expensive and probably unnecessary but to each his own.  If I had to do it again I would not buy these items simply because I don't think they are needed....
B00OAV6ZX6|5|Great product and do recomend
B00AVA2DJA|5|great cans.....
B00HFFL63S|5|Item fits perfectly. Only took me less than 15 minutes to install. Now my Tacoma turns heads with admiration.
B000A8FOTE|5|They do their job!
B002WMKHAM|4|This helmet is fine, i have a broad jaw and this helmet is tight at the jaw part and i dont feel too comfortable. for most people with narrower jaw this should be great. i take off 1 star for the jaw issue.
B000LY9GJ6|5|great product
B000LNQNBQ|5|Exellente
B000C5C876|5|Fit my 1989 Bronco II clutch and brake pedal.
B0047LW6X2|4|don't fit the handles on my VW Beetle
B008E7QT0G|5|Great product  brake pads  work just as well as someone at O'Reilly auto parts
B00WW0A69G|5|Works great had a problem with one ballast.called customer service and got a new one in 4 days and everything is working as it should. Would definitely recommend these HID kit
B00UADG1WI|5|Good price. And they came on time. Thank you
B008D72D5W|5|Easy enough to install and holds the device very solidly, even over bumps and jostles.
B000QFN3DU|5|Great tape, expectations meet.
B00DCD2I5M|5|Work perfect on a 2006 ford ranger, Duratec 2.3 liter, and also works perfect for Zetec Ford engines.
B0016KH1XM|4|works exactly as it should
B00IO99P9Q|5|Just as described, cured the wobble in our front end.  Easy to install
B00LFOBSO2|4|Easy install and adds strength to your weak Dana 30.
B0049BMFSQ|5|Excellent quality and fit, slightly different texture from OEM but the great price more than makes up for it.
B000H8Q7P2|2|Broke off almost immediately
B001CIWGHO|5|Excellent, does what it's supposed too!
B0062VP45M|5|Lol I live the sense of humor
B00I8SJPPW|5|This little pipe makes my CBR500R sound beastly! The seller was very helpful in answering questions about the effect of the pipe on my bike. Re-mapping or re-jetting is not needed as long as you leave the baffling in. Coffman shipped very quickly. Amazon said it would get to me between Tuesday and Friday. I got it Monday afternoon. In my opinion, this thing easily compares with the sound you get from the Two Brothers system, and at half the price. Very solidly built, great product, looks fantastic! Would absolutely buy again, and in fact probably will when I get any other toys.
B00SWTW4VY|5|Awesome levers- easy to install and make the operation of the bike easier with the adjust-ability. Purchased for my Honda CBR250R (2012).
B002XJGRJ4|5|Worked great, would be better if i could use the same size socket between the original and this nut.
B00EVY2SKG|5|Extremely nice cloths.  These are my Grade A microfiber towels for waxing car.  Definitely worth the money.
B009E9JZS6|5|Great price, flawless performance.  Will give this company more of my business.
B0007M1ZGE|5|worked great
B00B8X1YG2|1|Product arrived damaged. Comes with one cheap plastic nozzle. Seems sturdy but it's not or it wouldn't have come dented and cracked. I can't believe i wasted $54 on this junk.
B00DP89L04|5|Very happy with it!  It covers my bike very nicely ... and easy to put on.
B0007M1FNM|5|very heavy duty also serves it's purpose
B004EIBX00|5|Works great for my 6 volt 1966 karmann ghia battery
B002K06ZUC|5|I was looking for a high-quality, super compact, super light-weight adjustable wrench to form part of my mobile emergency bike repair kit.<br />I did some research and eventually found the range of LOBTEX wrenches.  These wrenches are very well made, typical of the quality one can expect from &#34;MADE IN JAPAN&#34; products.  There adjustable mechanism is precise and exhibit very little play.<br />The UM24SS wrench is one of the most compact HQ light-weight adjustable wrench available in the market.<br />Great little tool to form as part of any compact emergency repair tool kit.<br /><br />For slightly greater leverage, I also recommend the 150mm LOBTEX UM24.<br /><br />And finally, for even greater leverage with minimum weight, I carry a 28mm Titanium adjustable wrench from KS Tools (see: http://www.amazon.co.uk/KS-Tools-965-0008-Titanium-adjustable/dp/B007XU8FKW)
B000BZI4JS|4|Fixed it myself!
B004I1BEW0|4|2nd set in 4 years. First set, had to spray foam inside left headlight to stop the fixture from bouncing which caused a flicker.  New left  headlight has a slight flicker out of the box.  Wire  harnesses on each side had to be replaced after 2 years due to melting/ bad connection.<br /><br />I purchased 2nd set because it's still more economical than oem prices and these do provide more light output and the fact that I lost one of light bulb access cover which yiu5csnt find anywhere.
B007NKUMK8|5|Bright af
B0076DID6W|5|Good quality sticker
B000MCZK1U|4|Works great we use it here at our business to pump E85 ethanol from 55gal drums into smaller race jugs! Great buy so far!
B008LXULV6|5|awesome, works great and saved me over 3 kilograms over the original.
B0010E00T6|5|Perfect fit, good construction.
B006NZTZLQ|5|Great tool for anyone who wants more information than you dash cluster gives. Works great with TORQUEPRO app.
B001AIQ41A|5|It's perfect. Thanks.
B00AQ9QE3C|5|ok
B004I12T42|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 Access Cab. All bulbs and wiring harness included. Took 5 minutes to install.
B004ZF4F2U|4|I have just installed, and the kit came short of brackets to install the ballastros, but anyhow looks so far as a wonderfull product well made and a good presentation and support from their people.
B00UCNCSJ6|1|did not work for me
B00L08QD0M|5|great product great quality
B00FJJWMUS|5|This is just down right handy.
B00IKQZZ0G|3|It's a good antenna, but it started to rust at an alarming rate.
B00HFRLWSA|4|Easy to install and works as it should so far.
B006YDQ60U|5|I order this product to replace a stolen one. Was perfect and genuine!
B00KQHACMI|4|Only been a week since installed working good so far packaging was good
B0002TDUW4|5|Easy to use, it looks good and comes with everything you need. Remember, a paint job is 90% prep work, so make sure you sand and clean very thoroughly. tough stuff though.
B004K298TS|3|It worked and made the 2000 mile plus trip without major issues. It does have a lot of slack it the whole setup and the a few of the holes elongated by the time we got home. And yes, the bolts were tighten up correctly.  I think the life expectancy of the bar is kinda short and with all the slack at the connections to the vehicle, it's going to wear out quickly. I'll be using something else on my next trip.
B00545OUYS|3|It's just ok, I didn't notice any real difference and prefer to use RevX, I get a better result.
B008VOLLKA|2|Too small and it cost as much to ship as to buy. It is cute but not worth the money
B0082A3444|5|Works well in 2005 Toy Seq Limited.
B00BSGJQ4Q|3|not as bright as i thought they would be
B00266Z8MQ|1|Not worth buying
B0002STSC6|3|Works as advertised.  Not effective in bright sunlight because you can't see the neon bulb trigger. Definitely easier than holding the sparkplug against the engine head and looking for the spark.  It is not useful for evaluating the quality of the spark.  Best used when lighting is dim.  A benefit is engine will run normally while the spark tester is in the high tension circuit.  My use has been on one lung 4 stroke and 2 stroke engines.
B0060OJMJ0|5|GREAT BUY!
B000C19DL4|5|Would recommend. Great fit and finish and it works. Easy to install and great peace of mind.
B00P99KKAM|5|Thank goodness for this steering wneel cover, where I live it is very hot and the steering wheel is sometimes too hot to even touch. This also feels great on my arthritic hands, it is so soft. Easy to put your hands on and not slippery at all. I had to have my son put it on because I am not that strong so it does take some effort to get it on, but it is great looking and did exactly what I wanted which was to make my steering wheel comfortable in summer and winter! Thank you.
B007AOQWEC|5|love these
B00EVQHYOE|5|Easy to install,  bolt on loud horn solution.
B00RLV6QUE|3|Pod itself is terrible. It doesn't fit. Im going to have to modify it to get it to stay up. Instructions are non existent for the pod itself. Apparently its suppossed to stay up with hope and friction. Boost guage took about 2 months to break in. This includes the adapter for fuel pressure to the 7.3 and 6.0. I bought extra because it doesn't list that in the description. The guage instructions are kind of ok. The factory YouTube videos are better but still not great. The bezels are all loose. Does not allow use of your sun visor. 99 f250
B00PZYCT7S|1|what a waste of money! I love when things arrived damaged and I can't use them! It's bent and some of the backing is falling off and they aren't even sticky!
B005VV85QY|5|Genuine part that I installed myself. I suggest you buy the inexpensive tools to remove the inside of the door to make the job much easier. It plugged in just like the old one and worked immediately. Saved me a  lot of money not taking it to the dealer who told me I had to buy both mirrors when I only needed to replace the one. I'm not a machanic either. One of the screws was up behind the window but I have small hands so it wasn't a problem.
B004JQ3VRK|5|perfect oem fit for 2003 s class
B0065TA56O|5|Cool...
B001GC2LVM|5|I have used now at 3 different campsites. No concrete pad, 37 FT travel trailor and very poorly maintained sites. With the Andersen levelers I was good to go in minutes. I highly recommend . These are heavy duty in comparison to the yellow ones we have all used and crushed at one time or another. I'm confident they will last for years of camping (as long as I can remeber to take chock out before drive-off).
B0091KCOLI|5|Really like
B000C9QFDK|5|Works
B001O1X65A|2|The unit arrived with a dead battery.  Of course, I didn't have a spare 9V around... It probably would have earned 4 stars if it worked right out of the box.
B001F0GZZ8|5|Great product to shine and clean vinyl seats
B00FRV9TFY|5|Installed a couple of weeks ago. Car runs like new.
B000M5Y72A|5|A little brighter in my 03 ram 3500. Just remember do not get oils from you hands on the bulbs they will develop hot spots and burn out much quicker.
B00C5MKT84|5|These fit great and really decreased the noise under the hood. The extra material and rigidity of the flange allows the gasket to work as it should. I replaced a set of long headers that just sat too low under the car and were causing heat problems with the starter and several fluid lines and required several mods to clear other components. These fit and work great. The application is a second gen Camaro with an LS1 in it. The outlet flanges are stainless steel so I did need to make some steel version to weld to my exhaust since I didn't have the capability to weld steel to stainless. The doughnut gaskets are also a little hard to find as I could only find them online, but they seal great.
B009OBVY06|5|My car looks amazing. .😃😃😃😃
B00GOMQSCC|5|completelly perfect for the tanaka m29 airsoft gun. The stock screw, perfectly compatible. no issules, just replace and go.
B000KKNAKM|5|Fits insurance and registration perfectly and also fits nicely in my glove compartment
B00BKW4440|5|Excelente
B00PXGOJA8|4|Somewhat unpleasant to work with, it wrapped well around the exhaust manifold. It did achieve some reduction in the amount of heat radiating into the engine compartment during driving, my goal.
B0097AA37O|2|These are 7440 sockets as stated above not 7443. fortunately this will work for my purposes.  Edit: Doesn't fit in the socket on my honda. Looks like it should fit but it doesn't seat down far enough to screw in.
B004VFJM68|3|I'm not happy with the knob that tightens the rack to the car.  Seems flimsy and one came bent but I used it any way since sending it back would be a pain.
B000ET9SB4|5|good product, works well
B008YFTWOI|5|Excelente
B003S1RQ2S|5|Exactly as described and great for deer feeders.
B00HIRUQMK|5|I'm going to start by saying that I was a little hesitant to pull the trigger on this because there aren't really any good sources or ways to hear this before you buy it. Here is what it is and what it isn't.<br /><br />1. It will awaken the sound of the V8 in your F10 M5. It gives you a healthy increase in the volume when on the throttle and a wonderful low end rumble in idle. The fact that it ditches the vacuum controlled flaps on the stock exhaust means it's always much louder. There is no droning to speak of at any RPM and it is still very quiet with the windows up. The install was simple and took about an hour and the fit was quite good.<br /><br />2. This is not going to make it sound like an AMG. The exhaust manifold design and how it breathes into the turbos simply makes it impossible. But it is still a wonderful upgrade.<br /><br />I love everything about BMW's and specifically the M products over its AMG counterparts, EXCEPT, that MB has absolutely perfected the sounds eminating from their products. If not for this exhaust from Borla, this sweet M5 likely wouldn't have been long in my garage! Thanks Borla
B004FJKDP4|4|They work good
B0049HSNPO|4|Arrived quickly and worked like a charm. Too bad G.M. designs things in such an over complicated antiquated manner
B0049MRJ9U|3|The hitch didn't fit exactly...  I had to grind the bolt holes out a bit to get it on the truck.  It has worked fine since.
B009CCIAOK|5|Fit great, is working so far with no issues. Seams to be an exact match.
B000FLLWGA|5|Exact fit
B00E1SLXZ8|5|Perfect fit for my 98 camaro, looks sharp, red on red , arrived on time,
B000GV6GB0|5|Clutch is nice and easy now...Fit on a 2001 banshee with 3 stock clutch basket springs and 3 aftermarket springs
B009SIO9ZW|4|Worked great for over 2000 mile trip. The only problem was trying to get the plug to the back passenger side light. I ended up cutting the wires behind the plug on the tow harness, the splicing them back together once i got the wires into the space behind the light. Seemed faster and didn't have to drill that big of a hole. There maybe a better way to get them in there, but that was fairly quick. Running the wires is a chore, but its not bad, I ran them on top off the drivers side frame all the way to the front. Used some long cable ties to fasten the harness down, that part took about 20 minutes. All together it took about 45 minutes to install. Instructions are lacking, but its straight forward install.
B00DHI22SA|4|Adds a nice look to my car.
B00PX8U2I4|5|I was extremely satisfied with this product. Easy to install and very well manufactured.
B0040HGPZS|5|A little tricky to use at first, but amazing at putting an edge that will last on almost any blade you could imagine. A word of caution, do take care and use common sense when using, and alert people who may use the sharpened blades, especially things like scissors and pizza cutters. There are tutorial videos on YouTube that go into more detail about different blade edges. The product is very sturdy, durable, and made of the highest quality of hard plastic and Tungsten Carbide. The smaller sharpener on the key chain is great for on the go needs like for fishermen and hunters, even for fast machete sharpening, and axe/hatchet touch up's. The longer Handy Sharp has a studded grip handle which is balanced very well for easy use without cramping your hand. It also includes a V shape double sided sharpener on the opposite side that is great for fast sharpening of kitchen knives, as long as there are no Knicks in the blade. This product is, by no means, a professional sharpener, there are other products that hold the blade at a steady angle and are by far more consistent, but are by far, less convenient, so, I still give it 5 stars simply because it is small enough for carrying around and on the go, it does take a little bit of practice and skill, a last suggestion would be to practice on an old blade that you don't mind possibly messing up, and once you get used to the idea of how to use, then go to the blades that you want to sharpen!!!! Buy with confidence, and happy sharpening!!! It becomes addictive once you get used to it!!!!
B00017YYI6|5|Works very well.
B000CAO7XO|5|I love the amount of CDs that can fit into the organizer.  The only minor issue is that I don't have access to my visor mirror.
B00D2C7RKO|4|It works good
B007KTINX0|5|Not oily as other products. Like the smell.
B00HMZEXSG|5|Exactly what I needed to replace lost rivets. Surprisingly easier to pop off than what other reviews have said.
B008Y5CAEC|5|My mom ordered these boots and she absolutely loves them. She used them on a 5,000 mile motorcycle ride through Washington, Canada, Alaska through heavy rain and she said her feet were completely dry. She was very impressed with the quality.
B003NHH6LI|5|Arrived on time.  Very easy to install.  It's nice not to need to prop the hood open with an old broomstick
B003VCCUJI|5|Anything that makes changing oil easier is great in my books.  After lifting the car, taking off the belly pan, all you have to do is open it up and let it drain.  No more stripped oil drain plugs, just install it and never remove it again.  Only difference is that flow is slower through the fumoto so you have to let it drain for a bit longer than normal.
B00CD2R7A4|4|Installed easily.  Look great.
B0036GIDCW|5|Bags held up well during 2000 mile trip. Great fitment and storage capacity for the price. However, they are not at all water proof....
B00DUS3EKC|5|Way better than the stock radiator.  To bad it's hidden from sight.
B00BI170BC|5|Rain was coming in my convertible top I was going to replace and now i'm not
B00NANLIVY|5|I use the crap out of my auto start. Works worth my current fob..fairly easy install, it was more getting to the parts in the dash then installing. Came on time great condition. .super happy!
B00HS1HOFI|4|Works great so far.. Only been a few months since installation. Got rid of that irritating click click click click..
B00M5F8C26|5|better than the oem that came with bike
B000GZQM5Q|2|Tape was bad Twisted on end Looked good on bike Fell off and lost first ride! :(
B002UCYS0Y|4|These polish rags work great in concert with the Novus Plastic Polish and I would recommend them to anyone who uses Novus Plastic Polish.
B001N4QY66|5|Bought this unit to measure lathe speed. Works great.
B00EER3FVG|5|We mounted them to the t-top of the boat as our marker lights for nighttime boating and they work perfectly. So much brighter and easier than using standard handheld spotlights. The swivel base allows us to turn it down to light up the interior of the deck while fishing or gigging.
B005HAYDR4|5|Great
B00E1SMCXK|5|Callahan FRONT Premium Grade OE 282 mm [2] Rotors + [4] Quiet Low Dust Ceramic Brake Pads Kit. I just had them put on 4 days ago, they went on easily, the quality seems excellent for such a great price. So far they are smooth and quiet, I am very pleased.
B009462OC8|5|Fits as snug as a bug in a rug! Great attention to detail. Has a zippered access flap for fueling while cover is on as well as access holes for the mooring hooks. Has Built in ratchets to snug that baby tight when towing. Fits around the tower perfectly!
B005TMIHN6|5|Product arrived as advertised. We have a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee and this fits perfectly. Price was about half what dealership was asking.
B00CYLESV0|3|good
B005EMYS8O|5|Easy to install and works great.
B000HT8I9O|5|This was just what I wanted and the price was very good.
B00KGSCTYG|5|Great little bag, but I would recommend using different straps. It matches the denim paint  on my Harley Iron very well with its flat black leather.
B008XB82F8|5|Very good quality product.  Perfect fit and a nice leather storage case to protect it while not in use.
B00LGJ2GVU|5|It works good it just get hot from time to time
B000CB054S|5|Worked perfectly in my 86 22re 4runner.  Great value.
B00YIA2VH8|5|This keeps my car cool and looking cool at the same time.
B00BJL7ADO|5|These were so much easier to change than when you had to change over the spring.  And they improve the ride so well!
B00N9LMXUC|1|This product is too long for my windshield but too short in height. This results in a large gap at the top which allows all the air that heated up (hotter than it would be otherwise, most likely) between the reflective panel and the windshield where all the heated up air can escape into my car.  My car was really not cooler than it would be without the shade, so it was not worth the time consuming process of trying to situate it and use the suction cups to lessen this gap as best I could.  I am returning it, as it is too annoying and ineffective to even give away.
B000JZZDLM|5|Wrong parts for my engine, had to return.  Replacement parts works like a charm and solved my misfire problem.
B010GECSL8|5|Easy to install, look great, and protect the radiator.
B0054KSFI0|1|Fit the jeep patriot fine. Plastic feet kept loosening up and clips on it broke after a month of use with my kayaks. Would not recommend.
B0000AZ8JB|4|a
B00H7USCJ2|1|9 lights have 3 is bad
B007HUAFGU|5|Looks just like your picture in the ad, my husband thinks it looks great on his truck !
B00QXF16B8|5|This is perfect for any &#34;Lost&#34; tv show fan!
B003554TB8|5|This was just what we needed for our trip to the beach.We have a sedan, but it wasn't all going to fit. The bag was more than we needed. Although we strapped it through the doors and the straps were a little annoying on our long car ride  it definitely did the trick and held our belongings tightly in place and stayed dry durring a brief thunderstorm. I accidentally left another popular carrier brand's roof bag at my parents home during one holiday and had to order this one. I was a little apprehensive but after this trip my parents can keep that one (even though it was more expensive) and I will continue using this one. It was bigger and I honestly think it does a better job of keeping dry.
B00OVBN6PU|2|Works OK, and programmed well.  But within a couple of months the keychain loops broke off, so I cannot use with the rest of my keys.  Never had that happen with any other fob.  Will get OEM next time.
B001EA0LUY|5|looks great easy to apply fits almost every car and truck
B00E8CV0EQ|5|Compact, as expected. I have not tried it out yet. Still don't know the best place to keep it.
B00GQZ40U4|5|This item works well for charging while your bike is off. Just went on a trip and camped overnight. Plugged my phone charger in using this and it charged up in about an hour.
B008P0LEPW|5|Great as advertised.
B002WIYA5Y|5|Love it
B00449Q33Q|5|perfect fit arrived on time thanks.
B00B3P26N0|5|Love it
B00E5N2S7G|4|perfect fit and a good price.
B00EHIPL5A|5|Love it!
B004RNSO2M|5|Contains ZDDP. That's a good thing.
B00G2KICUC|1|I was happy about the price. I wasn't so happy about the switch not having the automatic down feature. The button is labeled with that feature and the part number matched up but the switch I ordered did not have that feature. Not pleased at all.
B00F676LQ4|5|Engine is running perfectly smooth on my GMC Envoy. This OE part has been upgraded in design from the original.
B00R6UOYEA|3|They weren't bright enough
B006RUGPVU|5|Good stuff for vinyl.
B007USCM7E|1|DO NOT TRY. IT IS NOT GONNA WORK
B00OJZ420G|5|love my pink lights!!!
B00UJGBQUI|4|It actually takes months to know how well it is working.  I've had prior experience with similar models and they work well.  I bought this one because it was so inexpensive and I needed a 12 volt model.  If it works as expected I will buy one more so I will have one on both my cars.  Read up, lots of info on line.  Know what to expect.  It won't revive a dead battery.
B0016OKLZI|1|This item does not fit automatic transmission
B002P8HIUU|5|It got here pretty fast. It was easy to install and it works great
B00PF0HIL4|5|Very bright and the focus is correct. Rather difficult to install, in my Honda, because the fans made it a difficult fit. Also, my Prelude retainer clips were made to be used with the Honda adapters. I bought clips from a seller in London. If you have clips made for just the bulb, these will fit like stock.
B000AMBOIK|5|Great charger - does everything I need it to do!
B0001CMUV4|5|I have a 2012 Toyota Highlander Limited with the factory receiver hitch. I have used it occasionally to tow Uhaul trailers etc. It made so much noise it would drive me crazy. Because of how this particular hitch is constructed, there were not too many options for anti-rattle devices. This device worked perfectly, almost like it was made for this vehicle. Simple, sturdy, and it works great. What's not to like?
B000C5J0A4|5|This was a great seal replacement for the high-mileage original that was leaking.
B00681BE2S|5|Works excellent was very easy to program.
B00TYT9ERI|5|Excellent product fit perfect
B0011N1TDC|5|Good tight fit
B000HEBR3I|2|. Bought one last year and only pumped about 20 gallon when the motor quit. Hoping it was a fluke because it is handy tool , especially for my Dad to fill lawn mower and not have to lift heavy gas can. Have bought two more to replace bad one. will post again if they go bad also.
B006EN65NI|5|cute
B004FO5P1Q|5|Carried a load to sturgis. Was very happy with purchase
B005N6XCBA|3|Runs small and doesn't stretch.
B002UC30AS|3|Wanted magnetic backing.
B004A535WG|5|New tins on new brakes? What more an you ask for? All went well and now my brakes perform better. I can stop 0-60-0 in under 10 feet.
B0051IME6Y|5|The product was perfect looks good fits perfect and does the job it's supposed to could not be more satisfied
B001TNM0YG|5|Good quality product. Wire leads were good quality stranded wire and long enough for almost and needs.
B000AMAE36|4|easy to change, clean color, better lighting all around.
B00279JFQW|5|it work great.
B0055PD1H4|5|Have not used yet seems to be as described
B00HX6P7YI|5|Works well.  Put on wall, not ceiling.  Makes it easy to figure out when to stop.
B004X29ZJ8|5|Excellent product!
B007S3MTI8|5|Great
B00HYLP3LO|4|My Valkyrie went from &#34;hard starting&#34; to &#34;problem solved&#34;. ;-)
B001C6Q7RQ|5|good price and works as expected.
B00F0MAZ1W|5|It does meet my expectations . Thank you
B003XGYDE2|5|Exelente
B00H2VVM8E|5|This paint is amazing. Dries rock hard. It can be messy so I wear 2 layers of gloves. One latex and one cotton. Plus an old long sleeve shirt and pants. It sticks to everything and is self smoothing. I let it dry for a day and then go over the piece to cover missed spots. Trying to get complete coverage only resulted in drips. I pour a small amount in a jar and use throwaway foam brushes. Also wipe the lid grooves and put plastic between lid and container otherwise the can welds itself shut. It also comes in 6 4oz cans for about $54 which is great if you are going to be using it over several weeks. If you wind up getting it on your skin, well you are going to be wearing it for a couple of weeks. I even tried acetone with no luck.
B0051I9IYK|4|Works and way better then my old ones. Only problem I had is the plug in on the ballast was dented and couldn't plug it in.
B000X21WRU|5|Great product!
B0002BC082|3|Good little tool but don't overstress or it'll bend outta shape and you'll spend more time bending it back than necessary. I still have faith in you Lyle. Even though my brake pad spreader tool busted with one hand. COME ON!
B000EDSSDY|5|Great product for the money.  Thank you.
B00PFPMLRU|4|nice item
B00DJEXBN2|4|It looks more tan than the photos. It looks closer to gold in person, the photos don't do the product much justice. Really enjoy that it is textured and feels like a brushed metal.
B0013OFIJA|5|I installed it as soon as I got it, it's very cute! I may be going a bit overboard on the Hello Kitty theme for my car, but it's fun. It's a decent thickness of plastic and the glitter is part of the paint, not glued on or anything, so it should not peel off. Time will tell if it will survive out hot temperatures and sun.
B000CFH2YK|3|Works find would recommend to buy.
B008Y977GE|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B000AMBNPY|2|It does not give any protection. The sun goes through it and one can feel the sun burning on the skin. I live in Miami, Florida so we have sun all the time. The only good thing is the shape.
B00RW4NVC6|1|Do not buy. They are not durable. Flimsy plastic. They refused to give me a prepaid shipping label to return their product. Would not recommend this for anybody.
B00YDDT9IO|5|I'm very satisfied with this product, it fits and looks perfect on my 2008 Mazda 3. Very stylish, good quality piece. Inside the package was a lot of installation instructions so I installed it in less than 3 minutes.
B00BWT353C|5|These are amazing if your even thinking about it get it for the price you would be stupid not to installation took me 10 minutes tops And they look great
B00K0VMXDQ|5|This thing is incredible took it out of box walked out and jumped my duramax  that went dead 4 days ago cause lights we're left on.Hit boost and started right up its very awesome .Charged a phone ipad it's pretty anazing.
B0066TLNT6|5|exactly as described!
B008YY691I|5|Nice love it.it came fast.
B005CHT4W6|5|I use this in all my vehicles I care about.  Old classic cars, current daily driver, my sport bike.  It's way cheaper than Mobil1, Royal Purple, etc.  I still do my oil changes every 3000 miles because I can afford to with this stuff.
B000CPJM9S|3|great
B00I9T39KM|5|Perfect fit, good price, great seller
B001EXCMKS|5|Perfect
B00559XYDG|5|Installed in ten minutes. Direct replacement part for the original unit. No one sized fits all after market garbage here.
B00736BVQG|4|It works
B004RT56FO|4|love the fact that they shipped quick but have not installed them yet. The price is great. I am looking forward to seeing how long these last. As described that these are used for racing so we will see how long they last on the mail route.
B000CIAVBS|5|This clutch kit was a perfect fit. My clutch works great now. It's like having a whole new car. I couldn't believe the price on the clutch kit and flywheel from LuK. I paid less than half of what I would have paid to a parts store in my area. Most of the cheap kits I looked at didn't even come with the throwout bearing or alignment tool. But this kit comes with everything, the pressure plate, clutch disc, pilot bearing, throwout bearing, spline grease, and the alignment tool.
B0027XAN78|4|Used on a ALiner camper. knob needs to be removed before folding  camper up. Works well moving air out of camper keeping it cool.<br />Easy to install.
B00318V5KM|5|Great as advertised.
B00GSWXN80|2|No Directions in kit and nothing on the internet for this design of tools!
B00371VKQW|5|Great fit
B00AHRHVT4|2|does not throw out light very well and not that bright
B000WLHGJA|5|Great as advertised.
B008UO1OHG|5|Awesome helmet!!  Bought two of them we wrote to Sturgis on them great helmet
B00KPR0G4S|4|Performed as advertised
B009KTAZF2|1|Terrible came distorted and faded. Tried to return. But no return label.
B0092K33C6|4|not the brightest the wire gauge is really small at night they light up my bike pretty good during day time u would not notice them like more expensive led under glow lights may buy more if I cant find a light with thicker wire the length of wire these come with is pretty good fully enclosed in some sort of vinyl or silicone  and their made in china
B006X98A7C|5|Read many reviews that said the battery won't fit.  Well, it fit into mine purchased in 2000 for the APC model listed in the item description.  Just make sure when you're looking at the bottom of the APC unit where the battery lid is, you have to insert the battery with the wire side in first towards towards the inside of the unit.  Otherwise, the battery lid will not close blocked by the connection.  The picture attached shows the INCORRECT placement of the replacement battery.
B0002SRF4O|5|Easy to use<br />Make sure you use grease on the cutting tool to pick up the cuttings<br />Once you have done the thread i suggest you turn over the engine to help blow out any loose filings<br />Ray
B007USQWWA|5|Fits well.
B0058WXNOK|5|good product.
B00GRHS8Y0|5|Easy installation, fits snugly
B00RW4OGC0|1|Do not buy. They are not durable. Flimsy plastic. They refused to give me a prepaid shipping label to return their product. Would not recommend this for anybody.
B0090B7M2O|5|nice tool, good price
B00G258I0G|5|I really, REALLY like this product!  My experience with Camco stuff is generally left me unimpressed, but this product is top-notch!  The construction is of top quality and I found the adjustment mechanism easily manipulated.  I can see how it might be difficult if you have ANY loss of strength or coordination in your hands, but I found it very easy to adjust.  I'd highly recommend this step if you want/need one.
B00EDFPNKA|5|Item as promised.
B0081T3PP4|1|I did not do a thorough job  reading of the product description as I thought this was R134a with dye. It is not. It is compatible with R134a, but it is a different substance and is FLAMMABLE, (which R143a is not) and is not recommended for R134a systems. If your system is R134a, I suggest purchasing a can of &#34;R134a with dye&#34; listed else where on this site. .I am giving it a one star because I think &#34;R134a Replacement&#34; is somewhat misleading.
B00EPDL7TQ|5|wonderful Father's days gift
B00LB7UYRA|5|I'm giving these seat covers 5 stars because of the bargain. They aren't the nicest seat covers. However, they compliment the car well. They fit my 2001 Honda CRV perfectly and they will fit practically any car well. This is due to the hidden elastic bands that hold them down, as well as the ability to tuck them in. I wanted something inexpensive to spice up my first car and these did the trick.
B00BUS3AKS|5|Installs in about a minute and works perfectly.
B000W1YAZ8|5|Good butts.
B00ISB8QPY|4|Great looking lift but needed bigger rear shocks and new upper control arms. They say works with stock suspension and it does if you mind a banging noise every time you hit a small bump.
B00AF67MSC|3|Lights are very bright and beautiful. But the control did not work so it looked more like christmas lights under the car.
B001B5E0SG|5|Great product...super fast shipping.
B001DH2U02|1|Looks like original; works great !!!
B00G7RP2TE|5|Very satisfied.
B00LHK6U2O|5|Just arrived today, so I can't say too much yet. But from what I can tell, they seem to be durable once placed on the tires. I love the design of the hubcaps, they completely transformed my car! I would definitely recommend if you want to spruce up your car a bit. I'll update in a few weeks to see how they're holding up.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/21/2016<br />I am happy to report that after 5 months of the hubcaps being on my car, they are still in place and still look great! Would definitely recommend
B00UJ8W9XE|5|When my pistons in my 2 stroke engine started to rumble and give me issues, I knew immediately that I needed to change my bore. I went onto Amazon and found this product. It came with all the right parts, and arrived quickly. I would purchase this again in a heartbeat.
B00LO0M918|2|I purchased 14 of these bulbs, and two were defective upon arrival (only LEDs on tip illuminated), and three more started smoking and melted the bulb base within minutes of first turning them on.  Voltage was checked and it was 12.9v DC.  The remaining bulbs do produce a bright white light.  I would not purchase these again.
B0045LJU2E|5|Good tape. Sticky and bright when u put the light to it. Great for trailers
B00KV8U20O|5|Good light replace myself easy job
B004RCT0JO|1|Didn't work rite.the points that I made work from a 66 impala ran wit no problems this product showed up wit a broken contact
B000IZ9T4U|5|Just did both the hot/cold blend door and the floor ceiling door on a 2003 Ford Expediation.  Both if you can believe it took just over an hour total.  No need to take all the molding off, just pulled back the piller trim and pulled out the cup and tray holders and pulled the molding out.  Tight space but with a small wrench and my finders took off 4 screws on each, pulled them off and put on the new ones.  I had unhooked the power for both years ago, to get rid of the clicking.  Wish I would have spent the 47 bucks for both years ago. PRIME free shiping and two days had both in my hands.  Dealer wanted over $400 to diagnosis, remove and replace both.  Amazon, Dorman one hour and $47 bucks later up and running again.  Its day 1 so I hope they last......
B000C83Q8S|5|excellent
B00NLN8LUY|5|Even though  the install was a pain in the ass, I will give these a 5 star. I had just installed  these the night before I was hit by another driver. They not only held up but the only damage was scratches.  They not only saved me vehicle  from being completely  screwed  they actually  saved my life by keeping  his vehicle  underneath.
B004MEBENM|1|didn't work on my 2003 dodge cargo van headliner.  took headliner off, peeled off the cloth.  dusted, sprayed both sides, waited per instructions, then attached.  even layed it upside down for 3 days!  came apart the first day i left the van in the sun.  so mad it didn't work.
B00L2T5XIC|5|Beautiful and Great Quality
B00H5F2G00|1|These are junk. The spray chrome came off in only a few days
B006572LVI|4|I was able to get the factory clutch play adjustment as prescribed. However, it doesn't appear that there is much adjustment life left...
B00GKSDQ66|1|This is a dorman part that showed up.wit price jacked up.sorry poor quality part that does not belong on a powerstroke thay dont fit rite.was returned.
B00BJ7YHUC|5|My son put these replacement hub caps on this weekend and they fit perfectly: they are beautiful, just wished I had found the Aftermarket Center Caps before.  Thank you very much.
B00T47KYZ6|1|It sucks it don't even cool at all
B006RW5NNY|4|Cool addon
B00B7LERQ4|5|It was to replace one that was in a accident.
B00HU6N3LK|3|Did a good job of getting the dirt and grime out of my leather seats. Only thing is it did not remove some grease marks and other dark stains. I did multiple applications with no luck. This is great for getting dirt out of your leather, just not a degreaser.
B0002SRCMO|5|I find this tool incredibly useful for removing plastic push-pins from the underbody of a Prius (the pins that hold on the splash shield.)  This is a much better option than the traditional flat screwdriver approach for pin removal, which tends to easily break, gouge, and deform these delicate fasteners.  The little black knob on this tool is also surprisingly useful as a leverage point.  All in all, highly recommended tool.  Get it!
B00JASCNEE|5|This a great product, such a simple solution that almost anyone could install DIY.  I have a 2x4 tube frame on my travel trailer welded to my bumper.  I ordered another set because I want to place one on each side of the tube frame.  I plan to carry my 3000 watt generator,that's 150lbs plus a spare tire and tools..  The 4x4 tube bumper welds were never meant to carry that kind of weight.<br />I know I'm probably overdoing it, but that's just me.  Check it out.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7Ys33KTxHg<br />Thanks<br />Charlie
B005E40BBA|5|excellent
B003QSDSFW|5|Nice look with a touch of chrome!
B0048SEQLO|5|They fit the rear brakes of my 2001 BMW K1200LT fine. They have good bite and do not squeal.  Very happy with them.
B00PYCXMYA|5|Great
B00GJ1I6Z0|5|Worked great on my 2004 F-350.
B007L2JNJ4|4|Could be a little bigger, as in the mirror and how far it sticks out. Not really big enough for what we needed it for, but worked well
B0006GBTP8|5|Great price! Exactly what I needed.
B00N58M6CO|1|This product did not perform as advertised.<br />Would not jump start my van even once
B000CITTW0|5|Used on my 2015 Ram Promaster and they work.  Put in rivnuts on the bottom but self taping screws on the top pf the brackets as the room to work is too small on this vehicle.  The step works on both the driver's and passenger's sides.  They do not extend as far out from the sides as they did on my F150 but are fine.  I like them much better than running boards!
B00ONH8RA6|5|Fixed my a/c problems in 08 Dodge Ram 2500
B00ZOKJVAG|5|very useful
B004UQQMYI|1|They scratch glass.  Used these with some Griot's glass polish on a Meguiar's DA w/ 3&#34; backing plate.  Fit was great.  All seemed well until I checked my work after 3 passes w/ light-moderate pressure on my first section.  TONS of swirls.  I guess this works for some, but didn't for my application.  Just be cautious before you go to town on your windshield or something like that with these.  Test a small spot with light pressure first.
B00X6TM762|4|Took a mo th to get here bit was the right sprocket
B000C57W7C|5|Good brand and great price. Shipped and received with no troubles. Installed and took to have front end alligned, everything checked out good.
B00BFE4OPC|5|works perfectly, fixed my issue on vehicle climate control
B009ROGZUE|5|Normally I'm not an OEM parts Nazi.  However, in this particular case I originally purchased a cross-reference alternative from a Car Quest dealer and after removing the original filter and physically comparing it directly against the aftermarket filter I noticed that the two filters looked nothing alike.  I also noticed that the inside bottom lip of the OEM filter had an oval shape that mates to a similar oval shape inside the bottom of the filter housing (I'm not kidding).  The aftermarket filter was just plain round.  I couldn't help but wonder about unfiltered fuel leaking in around the bottom of the filter and clogging the fuel injectors (and possibly destroying my turbo).  So I decided to put the old (dirty) filter back in and wait for the Amazon purchase to arrive.  The new filter was an EXACT match to the original.  The Car Quest parts guy swears by the cross-reference and says he has had no complaints... but I still wonder.<br /><br />The box this filter came in said it fits the &#34;2010 Dodge Ram 6.7L&#34; (only).  It does not state that it fits the 2011 or 2012 as some other reviewers have stated.  I would definitely call a dealer to get the exact part number before ordering for the 2011 or 2012 RAM.<br /><br />Please note you will need a 1-1/8&#34; socket to remove the filter (yes, a 1-1/8&#34; SAE socket, no metric equivalent).  A big crescent wrench won't work because there are three plastic flanges surrounding the socket head which force you to use a socket.  Do not over tighten!  The filter housing is marked &#34;30 Nm&#34; (newton meters) which converts to 22 foot pounds (meaning very lightly tightened because it's a plastic housing with a rubber gasket, not a lug nut).  I use a torque wrench.<br /><br />Also note that when you crack open the valve to drain the fuel, it takes quite a while to drain.  The first time I changed the filter I was impatient and pulling out the old filter quickly created a vacuum that sucked up the remaining fuel and spilled it all over the garage floor.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Great light, great price! Will buy again from this seller.
B007CDYX7Y|3|i use this for my sprinter all other brands collapse on me, even from the dealer, this by far has lasted me the longest
B009QRWGD2|1|These never stayed put on my 2013 Honda Fit, despite many attempts to re tighten and adjust things the rack would move around and loosen itself up in the wind. The clips used to attach to the gutter are just to narrow and of lower quality metal in comparison to better known brands. My attempt to save a couple hundred dollars failed when the rack came off while driving fortunately missing the car behind me.
B005VFWOOE|5|Sticker is great and the vendor is very serious about having a good service record. I've ordered several of their stickers and they have all been easy to apply and stay in place even in very hot and humid weather.
B009NIXRE6|5|Good product! Fast shipping. Recommended.
B003TKYWYI|2|Shipping came on time . But if you have a 2004 CTS i suggest you don't buy these they do not fit.
B004Z1J736|5|Great Struts, easy to install !
B006N96SS0|5|Worked like it should on a 2004 oldsmobile alero.
B002IV4KFA|1|Very light weight and not long enough.
B000TM7HXC|5|THANKS
B0007THS1S|5|Quick delivery nice fit.
B006WP6JOS|5|Disney Fan all the way.
B000BPWT0S|1|Nice looking but doesn't fit over the radiator hose.
B001GMZH5E|3|RUSTED!!!!! All of them came rusted
B000IDYKQO|5|I keep one of these on my key chain and only once had a problem - when taking the bar exam.  I've been through national and international flights with these, gone through government check points, and even been in the west wing of the White House - no problem.  ___________ 16.11.14-Update The other day, I went through security at the court house.  While they took a small key I keep in my wallet, they did not bother to question me about this device.  I've now had this all over the world, even at times when I thought security might not let me through (like in Morocco), but never once, except at the bar exam, has this caused me a problem.  Super impressed.
B0015PJCHG|5|Only the best from Loctite
B00CZEZNGU|4|I put two of these in my camper and they are great.  I can monitor my battery and if I turn these on it takes almost no draw on my battery compared to the old lights that are original to the camper.  They are much brighter as well, which can be good and bad.  Great light but blinding if you look directly at them.  The only down side is they cast a waffle pattern on objects.  Its kind of weird and hard to describe but it wouldn't stop me from buying them again.  They don't seem very durable but for limited use in my camper they are fine.  I'd still recommend them.
B00V3K82YC|5|good and convenient stuff.
B0074NM34W|5|good
B009KW82CC|5|I ordered this keyring for my son. He liked it very much!
B00GROFMC4|5|Perfect fit and works great for Mazda CX-5 rears!
B0015DQ81G|1|You really font need this simple manual one does fine job
B000NGIPP8|5|It made getting to the window regulator in my Buick much easier.
B004W97IY6|5|son loves them
B0087P9PTW|5|Work.  now i no longer have to go under the car.  so far they have work on a narrow track car [MG TC] and a wider track [Studebaker Champ]<br />It is now a clean hands job.
B002HXSAJ6|1|It was to fit my 2012 ford escape. Not even close. Still waiting to hear back from them.
B003BXUPHG|2|I like the design and it is on the lower end of cost for bump stops. The problem is I have had them come loose multiple times, the last time I tightened them on a vice and one came loose again getting pretty badly damaged
B0067UEKOY|5|Replaced OEM with this, seemed to be of same OEM quality. Made a big difference with initial off the line acclearation. easy to install.
B0013LEREU|3|Took away the popping when decelerating, not much change anywhere else.
B00GO49APW|5|This company was great to work with. Had a question after we received our turbo and they answered it very quickly. Turbo fit great and worked incredibly well. Saved a small fortune using this versus the OEM saab turbo. Would not hesitate to buy another one from them.
B0051UAEV4|5|Very nice liner.  I've actually slept on it a few times - very comfy!
B00DLMPJ8M|5|Everything works great I highly recommend them
B00ADFAZSE|5|It's OEM...
B0016OKJMI|5|Work Great.  I have Huskyliners in most of my cars.  Great investment!
B00BMTZRWY|5|HAs already paid for itself, easy to use.
B00OJ4VWHS|5|Love this bumper. Easy install, Solid as a rock, Aggressive as hell, and surpassed every one of my expectations. If you're looking for a stubby bumper, stop looking. I promise this will not disappoint. This thing is a beast!
B002XYT2HI|5|Fixed my abs problem
B00QTIAPRA|5|Fits exactly as expected! Looks great also!
B00CL6MVFS|5|Perfect fit and work great for Mazda CX-5 rears!
B00QLIRJ8Q|5|Good product for a fair price and speedy delivery!
B000XSJIL6|4|This did the job i needed it to by sealing and securing a suction shower shelf to the wall that kept falling down.  So far it is holding pretty well and i dont anticipate any issues.  I also used it to seal my sink.<br /><br />This product does not have an overpowering RTV smell like some of the others i have used in the past.  It appears to dry pretty quickly and whatever smell there is dissipates quickly as well.<br /><br />Please note that this is perfect for small jobs and small beats.  I did notice that the back end started busting at the seam while pressing it out, thats why it lost a star for me.  It wound up all over my  hands, so make note not to squeeze too hard
B00JBYVH5S|5|The anchor kept getting stuck in my boyfriend's pocket when he would take his keys out. He lost his, I bought a new set, and he lost that one, too. I got us rings instead.
B0024FOTOW|5|It worked just as expected
B006YCNAO6|5|Great product, perfect fit for the windshield.
B006X3ACXI|5|good quality locks.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Definitely worth the money.
B00DHGPVKI|5|A really impressive charger.  I like the electronic features: assessing the battery before charging, offering a choice of small battery (lawn tractor, etc.) or large (boat or car starting battery), and showing the phase, the voltage and the amperage for charging all at the same time -- really keeps me informed.  I've retired my old charger.
B00GXRH192|1|These are covers and were not what I was looking for
B000EVYGZA|5|Perfect
B00GT2FUB2|3|I really can't provide any feedback at this time.  I plan on using the device should I become stranded due to a discharged battery.  Hasn't happened...
B004SLSJ2I|2|Yikes, these pads did not even come close to fitting.  After doing some research, apparently this is a common problem with aftermarket parking shoes in general.  After reading a bunch of forums, we learned  the curve section at the top that sits in the saddle guide is usually not machined correctly.  Most folks will need to file it down so the pads can be inset enough to get the rotor over.  Not a hard job, but a pain non the less.  Also the powdercoating/paint was fairly poorly done, drip spots, heavy areas, and can get in the way of attaching springs, etc..  No problem using aftermarket Brake Pads and rotors, but for Parking shoes, go OEM.
B003UT1DPY|5|I recently bought a 2002 BMW 330i in jet black.  The car needed some love as far as the paint was concerned.  I compounded the car with my PC first using Meguiar's M105, followed by the M205 Polish.  The car looked amazing and I used this wax to seal it up and protect it.  The wax added a little bit of depth to the color which was nice.  The main thing that impressed me with this wax was its ability to repel water.  Its very impressive.<br /><br />I didn't get a chance to do the entire car after polishing because i ran out of daylight.  I washed the car to finish up the waxing and the difference between the area i had waxed and hadn't was very noticeable.  Water beads up and flows of the paint so fast its crazy.  I've only had it on the car a couple weeks now, so don't know about longevity yet, but other's have said its good and i don't doubt them.  Also since this is a liquid wax it makes it easier to machine apply which is how i do it.  Buy this, you won't regret it.
B005N53C9I|5|Durable and classy, despite the low price. Impressed.
B000VKT0AK|5|These work great! Iahven't had a single accident since installing them, therefore they work!
B000SPHRWQ|2|Received both shocks one of them was missing rubber bushings, cupped washers and nut.
B00DLMGE7C|5|The first time I bought these, one of the bulbs were bad so I sent them back easily through Quick Auto House. The second time I ordered these everything was perfect. Even recommended them to a co worker! We both love our HiD kits!
B000W3RU9Y|5|Well made. Good hooks. One photo shows termination, the other the hook pulled in place. Sturdy.
B001UC9QZM|5|Turns out I did not need to replace my pads, there was plenty of meat left but they would squeak occasionally. No regrets though, these pads are very well made and at a Great price, actually cheaper than local lower quality replacements. Very satisfied with quality and price. Excellent value.
B003X9TLUK|4|Part fit right in and worked just like it had come with the mower originally.
B00RSI3NI8|5|It is stuck to the front of my windshield and it gets a lot of comments. Well made and easy to install.
B00GLLW3AM|5|Nice and bright.  Low power consumption.  Replaced halogens on the pontoon boat.  Love them.  Ordering more
B0054YE8AU|3|Used it only once and it broke. I bought this to cover our trailer after loading our camping equipment. When I first took it out of the package I was impressed seemed like it was good quality and it came with a lot of yellow movable hooks for me to secure it to my trailer. After using it to make it the campsite, 2 hours away, it held everything down just fine. But when I went to use it again for the return trip I found that one string had broke in the middle of the net and another one is starting to fray already. Thankfully I was able to use one of the yellow clips and to close the gap, but at this rate I don't know how many more uses I will get out of the product.
B00ENU6WAK|5|very good material, nice 3M tape on back, I put this on the outside of my Nose cover, (bra) and it really set it off. Many times through the car wash and still not moved!
B0001XPC7C|5|Husband loves it
B004K6EZK6|1|I test the device, 3000 miles without any result. wrote to the company without success. I was installed in two cars of friends without positive result.
B00LMJPCO2|5|This key fits my 2009 650r but when I typed the model in it says it dosent fit, but I got it and it fits, and I like the red that goes with the red buttons
B002XYUVAK|5|Fixed my abs problem
B0032IPL0Q|3|Looks great but broke before we even got a chance to use it.
B000VKOD9S|5|As good as Hondas, for less money.
B00E3EWNVS|5|Perfect for the side windows. We need something other than the windshield. the sun beating on the car all day. I am going to order more for the other cars. Thank you!
B001GQ43Q4|5|Yes it did
B0030I3MCC|5|Very easy to install, will wait for longevity review.
B000CSEVK0|5|It's a Wix airfilter that fits my John Deere L130 Lawn tractor with a Kohler Command 23HP motor.  The fit is good, no identifiable increase/decrease in performance over the JD branded filter and it's at a lower price than the JD brand stuff.
B008BVNMX2|5|very good and just what I needed...
B00BFDHGVW|5|Honda OEM quality.  Took care of intermittent CEL and going into &#34;limp home&#34; mode.  While you're at it, it's also a good time to replace a leaky valve cover gasket or cam plug seal.
B0031GWLS4|5|I was a bear to install in my PT Cruiser...but seems to work great!
B00GQ01NXQ|4|They fit good on 2007 YZ450F. It is recommended to put small zip ties (that didn't come with it) on the throttle side.
B00ITESFGK|1|Tusted after a month. Looks like crap now
B005SB6S3Y|4|Pros:  Good dependable hitch. Reasonably priced.  Easy to install and use.<br />Cons:  You have to remove the spring bars and anti-sway device to back up and turn sharply.
B005TN2OO8|5|fit like a glove
B00CF5Q2HI|1|bought as a gift, they like it
B000G0PKV8|4|Like it
B00FB3GDXE|5|Sweet
B00EZ4PAN4|5|Muy buenos
B00LMI6VYI|5|These are just like the old ones except they are a lot claener. They are great.
B001SLEMFE|3|They serve the intended purpose. Utilitarian not luxury. Good value for the price.
B00CEXK9TS|1|Did not fit--returned
B000G22DDE|5|Looks great, functions great..what more can I ask
B009S31VBM|4|the pricing was just right.
B000NCOKV0|4|Works well have my two bikes hooked up
B00SR5FM6W|5|I purchased the GOOFIT PD24 Performance Carburetor for my GY6 150cc Go Kart. It has made a improved my Go Kart to my Go Kart performance significantly. If you are in need of a Carburetor for your Go Kart, I highly recommend purchasing this one.
B00RN77BIC|5|Great fit<br />But adhesive was not the best
B005ZWM0R4|4|it works but you have to buy the pro software to get full use out of it
B0009TU5ZW|5|worked great, good price
B000GS3B2U|5|I love my Suomy helmet and just purchased a spare shield is all.
B00EPDLSKO|5|Looks great !
B00S19OQ98|4|Re: KTM 990 Adventure:<br /><br />I've heard bad things about these pads, mainly because of the price. I installed them quickly and easily. They seem to work fine. They stop the bike just fine. Will see how long they last.
B00JIEX722|5|Added an extra touch to 14 silverado lic plate
B0035JHO7U|4|Manual Transmission: -Sounds as expected at low RPM's, at higher speeds like on the highway it seems to be a little quiet IMO. -Not as loud as I would like but it's not quiet either (revving at stop lights/tunnels is still fun). -Drones around 2k RPM's. It hasn't bothered me so far. -I'm still able to listen to the radio -If you're paying to have them installed, i would suggest don't go for anything over $200. It takes about an 1.5 hrs to install. -Overall it's fun, I enjoy driving my Challenger RT Classic even more and all my friends think it sounds cool.  **You will not have the loudest car on the street but you will have that low throaty tone that the Challenger should have** **Also Check out Youtube Videos and compare against other brands such as Borla, Corsa, and Magnaflow**
B000JLKZYQ|1|Fake product. Real Weber is made in Spain, I emailed to ask if it is a genuine Weber product and they told me yes and that it was made in China. Buyer beware.
B00M0443ZW|1|not this one again
B00CLV8K0I|5|Works great
B00GOXMTBK|5|Everything seems correct. I wont really know until I have to use it
B003E3O538|5|They are great and they fit my f-150 gooooood
B009ETT7CU|3|Too small....my fault i should have read size.
B000COCX0E|1|I specifically ordered a m12 1.25 oil plug and received a m14 1.50 a totally different size.
B00SKEFWWY|5|I got the key blank fast , and it was cut for me on a  key machine for one dollar , it works great.
B000BGK22E|5|Exactly what i needed

B00K6Q2JTI|5|Bulbs fit just as they should---work very well for my fog light application---easy to install!!!JLF
B00M7BB702|5|First off, you should know this exhaust slip on is not legal. Depending on state, you may not get away with it.<br />Anyways, I watched videos with this on some 650R, but was not expecting what I heard when I started my bike. It has an incredible rumble at idling and sounds amazing when flying down the streets.<br />Secondly, this took no time to install. Roughly 15 minutes to take of the stock exhaust while this took less than 5.<br />Great buy for the price. Highly recommended.
B008FYKS32|1|DEFECTIVE DESIGN!!! Cheap plastic clip holds blade on arm.  I've had two lose the grip and one fly off during a storm leaving me blind.  DONT BUY
B007ZDDUCK|5|Fantastic product!
B00BI3WLHS|5|Great
B00JA3BMDW|5|Great!

B00TRFAE4Q|5|Perfect. Exactly what I wanted.
B00ABVOOP0|5|Worked perfectly for my 1982 Honda Express moped. Installed right out of the box in minutes. Not needing to fuss with acid was totally worth a few extra dollars for me.
B007AOR29G|5|love it

B00ECTRBHA|5|Great!!!
B004J9A8EQ|1|THIS DOES NOT COME WITH THE FILTER AS IS ADVERTISED!!!!!!!
B000E3DT4W|4|Great product! Slightly misshapen, still doable!
B000C83T5I|5|It's works like the original part.<br />Thanks
B00F4YI3RO|5|I had a pair of these but I lost them, I used them already and they work perfectly
B003RLJ8HU|5|The running boards fit great. They weren't too hard to put on and our truck looks really good.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|When I first received this pouch, I was overwhelmed by the strong petroleum smell.  I hung it out to dry.  The smell's gone but there's still that slightly sticky petroleum touch to this.<br /><br />I quickly found out that this pouch, while effective for small purses and small knickknacks, is not a good idea in a Dodge Caravan in which a pack of dogs travel in.  I take my dogs in my van to the nearby trail heads for off leash hiking and they are used to jumping in and out, and thus right into this thing.  Even when they see this pouch in the way, they just shove it out of the way.  So that turned out to be a NoGo.  The pouch hangs centermast between my two front seats, a perfect target for my persistent dogs.<br /><br />The only way I can effectively use this is as a pouch for my front passenger seat.  The pouch is too small for my tote bag (it fits in sidways with the top hanging out)  The pouch is best for small items like Gatorade bottles, emergency flashlight, bags of snacks, etc, small items that are too big for the center console but small enough for this pouch.<br /><br />While the petrol smell is long gone, I'm still not crazy about the feel of this pouch.  It's highly flammable.<br /><br />I received a free sample in exchange for a review
B00OWMA5WK|1|The cover's flap inserts, when pulled out to provide cover, were too wide to secure, would not fit in my 2015 Tucson's, I'm returning for a refund.
B001CVXW1K|5|Comfortable, great fit, over glasses! Dont look so bulky as some of the Scotts goggles! Highly recommended!
B002QSHIC2|5|Excellent product

B000C9I8JO|5|Perfect OE replacement for my GMC Envoy.
B00LHKRV72|5|Excelente producto.
B000DINKPQ|4|I expected louder since it boasts so much about it.  It's louder than my OEM, but not as loud as the packaging would make you think.  Sounds like a Semi when paired with the matching low tone.
B000ALJ4NS|5|This was excellent! Had to fix a nice marble table top that broke off when it hit the ground. Mixed the materials, slathered the marble up, attached the piece and held it in place overnight. Gave it a good tug the next day, no give, no wiggle, nothing. Hard to even tell that it broke in the first place!
