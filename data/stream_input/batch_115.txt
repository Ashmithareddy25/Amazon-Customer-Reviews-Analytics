B005USGLWS|3|The ankle &#34;lace&#34; or &#34;netting&#34; was much larger and, I guess you would say, fluffier than expected. I was a little embarrassed to put my daughter in these since she was supposed to be wearing them to a wedding. However, she received many compliments on them and mostly because she is so young-she pulled it off. If it hadn't been so close to the wedding I would have sent them back and picked out something more demure. Good condition. Good shipping/packaging. Seems like a good company product, just not my style.
B004NNHJW2|5|Based on other reviews I chose to order a full size down from my usual size and I'm glad I did. The fit is very sharp and the material seems to be of a high quality. I originally bought these as a work shirt, but I might get some additional polos in more festive colors for casual wear in the future. For now I'll stick with what I have and see how they stand up to the wear and tear at work. For the price, I think these are a great value.
B005RHDHI8|5|Very comfortable
B00URXF5IC|5|It fit perfectly. Just as described. Love it!
B008BUCGXK|3|Super short torso. It worked for what I needed, though, which was only the top part, but do NOT buy if you are planning on using this as a leotard for sports and have an average length torso.
B004S79EWG|4|These are nice skinny belts... they are not ultra skinny.  I was expecting about the width of your pinky finger.  These belts are about the width of your thumb.  I ordered these in Red, Orange, Pink, and Brown.  The red on is the best, the brown is a nice color.. however the pink and orange are a little bright.  Pink and orange are very much in this season but, in a little bit of a deeper color, so I don't know how much I will be able to work these in.  Also I was hoping for a royal blue.  Came in a timely fashion.
B002HELROU|5|I'm 45 years old and this works just as I wanted. The buckles on most belts I buy fail making me buy more belts. This item saves me money!
B00LY3KUCA|5|I bought 5 more of this, using this as a cover up on my Zumba class/workouts, concealing my tummy, giving me more confidence. I don't even need to hold my abs in!!!
B0038R23PC|3|My twiggy days are over it seems as these jeans were way too small and I ordered my customary NYDJ size.  Try try again.
B004BTNDBY|5|Very happy with the shirts the quality is very nice.
B0046ED64I|3|Even with the curved waist, it gapped in the back, and the boot cut leg is nearly like a bell both.  These are really nice jeans -- great denim fabric and faded just right.  Sadly, they will have to go back.
B00M0JQRHE|5|Excellent quality and a great price.
B00L2EU6IO|1|I love Tahari, thought this would be great, but the color was so dull, I sent it back. I did nto even try it one because the color , desribed as &#34;macrame&#34; was more like dead mouse. I uses to macrame right and left back in the 70's. Macrame was always a &#34;natural&#34;  shade. More off white than grey.. I did not even open the package, the color was too drab.. Not Macrame at all. These designers have to stop putting fancy names onto their drab failure dyes.
B00QN8M880|3|They are very nice but if you ware a medium you need to get a large
B00075YVIK|1|I ended up putting this bra in the rag box. I am a 38F and nursing. The first size I ordered was too big, the next size down fit, but the cups provide so little support and the straps are too short so that the back of the bra pulled up practically to the back of my neck. I really wanted this bra to work, because it seems like it could be very comfy, but it just wasn't cut right to fit my body.
B003UO9YCI|4|These gloves are great overall, and very similar to ones seen in Drive. The finger length was perfect, however they were slightly wide as if made for fatter fingers, and the hand width was also a bit wide for my hands - my first two knuckles line up with the holes, the other two don't. For the price these are not bad, and they look great.
B00S17LTF4|4|Seems to fit smaller than a regular size 2, which I normally wear. I decided to keep it nevertheless.
B0051U195O|5|These are great cold weather socks.
B00HQROBY6|1|This product is very uncomfortable it bulges under rib cage and It causes pain and redness in area where product bulges up
B001JBNDM6|5|WHAT A PRICE  WELL BETTER THEN I EXPECTED.
B00786Y6RC|5|Very nice Sunglasses
B00589XU1O|4|Bought it for a Halloween costume as a scarecrow.  It worked well.  It does look more orange in person than in the picture though.
B00GTB0T1O|1|Tried yo go 1 size smaller I'm a 18/20 and this was way too small.
B001FT0I02|5|It was a little smaller than i thought it would be, but it is in very nice shape and really easy to fix up. Just some black duct tape and metallic silver spray paint and it looks fairly realistic.
B0026DURGG|5|Very cute!! fits easily on the body
B000ZJWGIA|5|A good sturdy checkbook, did not come with check divider but got them at a very low cost. This is not the checkbook for those looking for beauty, it is very much a utility cover.
B00O7S9GAG|5|Good!
B005GKGOPO|5|Product shipped fast and was in excellent condition. Adjusts, fits well, and looks even better. I immediately ordered more after I got this one! Must have!
B00C76X4RQ|5|These shorts are great, fit great, feel great and would buy them in every color. Love the dry fit material
B00CKHZ58S|2|The sweater appears nicely knitted and is a pretty dark green.  I am greatly disappointed because it is impossible to work the enormous buttons through the button holes; hence instead of the cardigan sweater I anticipated, I now have  a pull over. Or, I will have to purchase some very, very small buttons, which will look inappropriate.
B002ED6HMQ|5|Just what I needed! In the professional world where I work it really isn't appropriate for certain body parts to show.   I'm already a large breasted woman who doesn't want my breast size increase with a padded bra.  This is a great alternative.  The product does exactly what it was intended to do, it doesn't show through my clothes and it's comfortable. I'm telling all the girls about it!
B005FIXPLS|5|I love these pants despite the bad reviews....<br /><br />If you look closely at the picture you can tell the bottoms are loser than normal around the ankle which is why I bought them, the elastic on the one's I can find hurt my skin after a day of wear.<br /><br />I'm 5'3 3/4 inches tall and am a size 10, if you have a tummy you might want to size up otherwise they might show more than you want since their snug.<br /><br />I bought these in a medium size and they fit like a dream, I like that they don't sag in the butt like most sweat pants do they show it off.<br /><br />If your concerned about the closed bottom being to big pair it with high tops problem solved...
B00G570JPS|5|I really like this shirt. It feels great and looks great. Great value!
B00NVSGR3M|4|Great quality of material and well crafted. Sleeves are somewhat longer than a normal large shirt, but can be easily rolled or hemmed.
B00L7QXKH6|5|I absolutely LOVE this lace top.  I was a little skeptical, as I am larger in the chest area, so usually wear a size 12 top, and so I ordered the XL, as their &#34;new&#34; sizing indicated.  Well, it fits PERFECTLY.  When I first held it up to myself, I though, oh oh....but when I tried it on....keep in mind, this is a &#34;fitted&#34; top, with sewn darts making the area just below the chest, fitted.  It has a good quality zipper in the back.  The lace is of very good quality....I can't believe I got this top for such an inexpensive price.  I would expect to pay $80 for it, in a classy retail store.  The front &#34;V&#34; of lace, hangs down, just covering the tummy area, but not too long.  The top is lined.  When held up to the light, it looks as though the front would be &#34;see-thru&#34;, but when it is on, the liner does the job, and is also of very good quality.  I will be wearing this top a LOT....alone, as a top, and also under a nice blazer jacket.  Thinking I should order another one!!!  Absolutely love this top.
B0084AWRMC|4|Fits somewhat large especially sleeve length but I really like the steen mountain fleece this is the second one I now own and they really last and are very comfortable to wear...Thanks
B006C9GLXS|4|Used as a film prop
B002SW3EUG|5|The sunglasses are of good quality and he actually allowed the glasses to stay on his face without fighting them.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B00C7WCBM4|4|34x32 Muse fits pretty snug but looks great. I'm 6'4 athletic build and it conforms great to my body
B00K6I9EOY|5|Bought them for son. He said they're &#34;cozy and warm&#34;! He loved them
B001H0F412|4|This is a good alternative to Nike or UA.  It is a cheaper alternative and does the job.  I will buy another pair when the need arises.
B00481I8RE|5|I bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a Music Festival that we were attending. It was perfect! We received many wonderful comments and saw many, many smiles! Fantastic dress!     Sizing Comment: It does seem to run slightly on the small size. I bought a size larger than I normally purchase. It fits now.
B00DOXB1U8|5|Love this shirt! Look even better in person!
B004GYYKBG|4|These pants are so much cooler than others I have tried!  My only issue is that they are noisy.  I would compare the sound to the sound that taffeta makes.  I will still use them regardless of the noise because they are so comfortable!
B000ZL779G|5|Great tie. Looks just as pictured.
B009WU4QJA|5|A+ fits well, comfy, doesn't fade when washed. Has no flaw. Front of hat shrunk very little after was, hardly noticeable.
B007HSCKQK|5|Super comfy tee (I ordered a size up), made of soft material.  Awesome print reminiscent of Van Gogh's &#34;Starry Night.&#34;
B0050UP9VK|1|Website makes a false claim that Large will fit 36/38, but does not.  I have 5 other shorts from 3 different manufacturers and they are all size 36 and fit me well.
B002MQMZVM|5|Perfect all around. Going to get another one.
B0089SX6U6|5|Great!
B00KGFD0VK|5|Very comfy and stylish as nursing bras go. I like the little blue ribbon - shows over some tops and looks more like a camisole than bra.
B000P5AYDI|2|All the velcro spots were very misaligned so it wouldn't stay closed without big bulges in the fabric. We ended up just leaving it open. You get what you pay for!
B006FIXM9C|2|I purchased these socks to wear with my work shoes, however they don't fit my feet. To give you an idea, I wear a size 9 1/2 in nike women's dunks.
B008VARK8Q|4|These aren justas expeced and wanted.
B001789R0I|3|This was bought at whim at like 2am. They are comfy but I they are worth the money. The logo is nice...It fits a bit tight and is made in VIETNAM
B00BJ84Q52|5|Nice shirt and an excellent value
B00TH2NC3O|5|Burnside Men's Hukilau Tropical Short Sleeve Shirt<br /><br />This is the ultimate Hawaiian shirt. The colors are great and versatile to wear with any solid shorts, pants, or jeans. It's not over-the-top in design; as in not tacky. I would recommend this shirt to anyone who likes tropical shirts that are light weight and not rayon or polyester.
B00JW2S15I|4|I needed some more Tie clips and , I was looking at the clips Amazon was selling, behold i just know i had to buy . The clips fit just right and goes well with all of my grey and black suits. I received my Tie clips on time as stated by Amazon.com Thanks.
B00MGLWYJ6|3|My daughter just turned 12, she is average size, but the dress was a bit small for her. Also, she complained that it was rather scratchy. Otherwise it looked good.
B00IOVG3NK|5|So cute, loved them for pictures!
B008Q0E61U|5|I love that this allows me the chance to change my tie clips on a daily basis. Each of them look of high quality, and hold a tie down incredibly well. Worth it!
B00NG8LH50|5|better than expected.
B00CEPB2RE|5|very warm
B00DW6OIHK|5|These panties with the no-slip feature are wonderful and fit like a dream. No more creeping panties!
B0089DX0N4|4|This hat came to me in great condition, not crumpled or bent.  Material was in good shape.  Shipped in stated time frame.  Only complaint.....it was a bit big for my head.  I could wear a bun on my head and still wear the hat. This did not stop me from taking it on my cruise, I just made due with the situation.  I think that the coverage over face and shoulders was plentiful. Perhaps having specific circumference measurements from seller in the future would be helpful.
B005SW3Q7E|4|Seem to have shrunk with a few washings but still fit over my other clothes.  I would not order any larger size as I normally would.
B009IUJ1EE|1|I dont like these pants. their too short on me and the button on the pants was too big for the hole and i had to cut the hole myself. these are more like dressed pants than casual, overall i dont like them and they looked better on the picture
B00EDYEZHI|5|This garment was super soft but not too thick. My infant kicks his socks and blankets off so I needed something to keep him warm without making him sweat. It fit him perfectly and keeps him warm!
B00ATNDQV8|5|Such a beautiful white dress for spring or summer.  Beautiful material.  I would recommend that if you have a wide back that you order 1 size larger so that it will fit comfortably but other than that its beautify.
B00M2URM1Q|1|Honestly the worst product I've ever bought from Amazon . I read the reviews and everyone said to get 2 sizes up. That could have worked if you are the size of a 4 year old. I would not recommend this for anyone
B000UJF0GA|1|Love Cherokee workwear in cotton not this new material. Fit is different will return as soon as possible. Be careful to read description.
B00AHTZWHA|5|I am very picky about the fit of a bra. I am very happy with this one. Comfortable and very supportive.
B001ELL6B6|1|Please note:  I ordered a 36DD.  The package said it was a 36DD.  But, the bra itself was a 48D.  Big time error by whoever packaged the bra into the sealed plastic bag.  Since I figured this out after the 30 day return window--I am SOL.  Also, as much as I've loved these Glamorize bras in the past, and I've bought quite a few, I've been noticing recent shipments have elastic problems.  Fairly soon after starting to wear them elastic strings are hanging out and they don't have the fit that they used too.  Not very durable.
B000UJGNCK|4|the pants were as expected I would like to see them available in a shorter length size
B00QE4NMFQ|5|My grandson was so pleased
B002RF54WK|5|It was exactly what I wanted and I would and will buy more.
B00CXV79X0|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B0084NJR18|5|Good pants if you want to buy this go for it!!!
B00K8D03MY|3|it was kind of tight
B000UGT5JG|2|I purchased the concert wig for my daughter for her halloween costume.  It was better looking than the wig they were selling with the costume itself.  It has highlights in it instead of being all one color.  That was cool.  I was a bit disappointed because the picture on the box looks like it has colored highlights in pink and blue in it, howevef it does not have it on the wig.  We had to buy a Hannah Montana hair highlight stick elsewhere. Also, the bangs were a bit too long and had to be trimmed a bit.  The other disappointment was that you could see the seam at the part when you put it on and brushed it out to look like the picture.  Lastly, as with all play wigs, when you brush it, you pull out lots of hair.  For the price, I would think that it could be made a bit better with colored highlights or even another accessory like a microphone that goes on the head.  That would make it better too.
B00CAIAAKA|5|Fast shipping, as described
B00QQQM7MG|1|Poor quality of sewing, many loose threads, remnants of threads not cleaned seam
B00IQ8OAAY|5|This shirt fits very well and is the wool is softest I've ever encountered.  It's going to be great for fall and winter but it's too warm to be worn year round.
B0039VOALM|5|Awesome tank. Such a fun xmas gift. HUGE HIT!!
B00LVQ8LTY|4|Great design.  Comfortable.  More interest than regular long sweater.
B008MA1Y0K|2|After I put one of these on, I had to come back and check to see if I ordered a TALL by mistake. The shirt body and sleeves are longer than regular fit shirts.  I really don't like the length. Although they are otherwise fine, I will not order these again.
B00N3H9FAS|4|Not expensive looking, but cute.  For the price, it's good to wear for fun.
B00IG4QD1W|4|My baby gets lots of compliments on this jacket. Very pretty colors and blue is a pretty color navy blue not a bland color.
B00GY1WM4G|5|Perfect
B00HNN7L0O|5|very good product
B00L58RCRK|5|pretty and good quality - good buy
B000GOXSTK|5|These jeans are probably the most comfortable, best fitting jeans I've ever owned. Normally when I wear jeans I feel like I'm swimming in fabric because relaxed fit just doesnt contour to my legs. These however do and do it very well! They're also surprisingly stretchy and comfortable...very soft for denim. I find myself not wanting to take them off. Wear these with some clarks desert boots, long socks, and roll up the pant legs a few inches and damn are they stylish.
B006CPWTOW|5|Excellent hat with cool style, warm too.  Extra bonus, it embarrasses the heck out of my teenagers when I wear it.
B000VWE5SK|4|Love these coveralls.  Extremely warm and comfortable, plenty of zippered access to needed areas.  Have lasted well and maintained shape.  Simple washing machine cleaning and ready to go...
B00FZ3DQWG|5|SON LOVES THEM SO FAR...HOPE THEY HOLD UP AND TIME WILL TELL...
B00974B1DA|5|Waooo , First time a bra fits so perfectly
B00KHUQDI6|3|It's alright but it's shapeless and baggy. I like the material but that's about it.<br />Since I got it to wear with blazers and jackets, it will do. But I don't feel appealing in it without a jacket.<br />Good enough for a professional outfit.<br />It's also not beige. It's more like a faded pink.
B00PXVSEKY|5|Beautiful jacket, bought 12 months for a 9 month old, somewhat snug in shoulders and arm holes
B00EY5H76W|5|I initially found this dress on other websites for a cheaper price but the websites didn't have the best reviews as far as being trustworthy. There were also several complaints about shipping taking over a month. Therefore I stuck with Amazon because I've never had any issues.<br /><br />I ordered a Large which from shopping around I learned is actually the US equivalent of a size 10/12 dress. I was  very worried since I'm inbetween sizes (12-14) and very top heavy but still I decided to order the dress. I purchased it the week before Thanksgiving and it was estimated to arrive December 19-January 8. Thankfully it actually arrived December 2 in great condition. I tried the dress on and it fit snug but I was just glad it fit since it was a gift to myself for all my weight loss progress. I found no flaws or problems with the dress. I feel you can wear the dress with or without a bra, depending on your comfort level. It has great support in the shoulders if you do decide to go braless. I would definitely recommend some form of spanx to wear under it because it is a body hugging dress and it will show panty lines or other insecurities. Overall I LOVE this dress. Not sure where I'm wearing it to just yet but I definitely didn't want to take it off!
B007YBDKZK|3|what I expected
B00A0Q0MNE|5|really lovely and cool to wear.
B00KY6YPX8|5|Nice
B00EYXIN30|5|Love this damn thing. It fits really well. Super soft material, and is now an icon reference to me at school. Excellent quality material. Very happy buyer.
B000GBLY5S|5|Great product  although expensive . Amazon gave free shipping and expidited with insurance . All said my wife was ecstatic and i was most happy with Amazon
B0058DQR1A|2|It came tangled up, frayed, and extremely unevenly cut.<br />Good thing I bought a hat to go with it or the entire top would have hair sticking up.<br />Ended up point cutting the ends of the hair to remove the matting.
B000WKRJW0|5|This is my favorite bra of all time!  I am a girl who is quite ample on top and find it extremely difficult to find a bra that fits well.  I don't like any my breasts to puff out either on top of or on the sides of the bra that I am wearing.  I also like for the center piece to separate my breasts as much as possible... and touch my sternum, if at all possible.  This bra delivers on all fronts!  I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase and the price on Amazon is fantastic!  I will definitely be ordering more in the future!
B00M4WW8RA|3|Great shirt looking shirt. Material is somewhat cheap and itchy.
B00EF52DYM|4|Daughter is 10 and they fit just right. Have not pilled and have washed them many times.
B007SV9DBQ|5|I love this dress. The material is very pleasant and the whole thing is extremely comfortable. It fees and looks nice. The belt is pretty gives it a sophisticated but discreet touch.
B002APXNJI|4|Like the pants.  Can't seem to find them with cuffs, however.
B003TJSIOO|4|as expected
B00AOCX43Y|5|I love this shirt....I get so many compliments when I wear it!  Thank you!
B001SI98TW|5|Product arrived promptly and exactly as described.
B00R83AGTC|5|Have not washed yet. May shrink with first wash and that would be fine
B008FREVR8|5|Love these belts!  I gave them to as Christmas presents to my nephews who are paid firemen.  They are sturdy, attractive, and very well made.
B00VTVE0IW|5|I have finally found the perfect undies. They are so soft, don't ride up and fit perfectly. I have always worn a medium in underwear but I am a size 4/6 so I went ahead and got the smalls. I'm so glad I did. They are definitely function over fashion but they are wonderful everyday underwear. I'll definitely be buying more!
B00K6JZMJE|4|Adorable shoe... came early. My only complaint when they came they had a chemical smell, i washed thsm twice and now there great.
B004TLVK4Q|1|When I got it seemed perfect for reading glasses.  Unfortunately the spring hinge broke after 3 months. Guess I need to look some more.
B00DKT5G34|2|The pants are a corduroy material.  It did not mention this in the description, and I definitely couldn't tell in the pictures.  I'm not a fan of corduroy, so I'm not very happy with these pants
B0084AWRMC|5|Excelente
B00ARKNVFO|5|Great nursing bra! Comfortable from day to night...good support
B00NA3CE08|4|My grandson loves this hat.  It runs small so it's best for young toddlers. It is fleece lined and that's a plus
B00SKBEXJA|4|It was nice
B00DIA70XO|5|I was truly satisfied with the chefs pants.
B00K0BPLZS|3|Had to return it, was a size too big. I had ordered a large.
B006ZUA9Y6|5|This dress fit like a glove. It's a perfect fit for an hourglass figure. I love the feel of the fabric as well as the vibrant colors. I could not be happier!
B000UAQNPQ|3|Somewhat uncomfortable.
B006IUXQDE|3|I was pleased with the pajamas with the exception..........I WAS EXPECTING A TOP BUTTON.<br />I am handi-caped and a top button is great for bathroom use , I like the fabric and the comfort.have no other
B008KATBJ8|3|the cut of the vest is extremely too tight. the fabric and build are decent. it supposed to fit a 56 it does but not comfortably..
B00EB6IKTM|5|Nice jacket for fall.  Fits true to size
B002SUD1HY|2|I agree with a previous post, it's a good reversible jersey except it is most definitely grey and not white.  I bought four of these for a hockey team and the league eventually told us we could not wear them for white because is did not match others on the team with actual white jerseys.
B000EQOBS2|5|These were for my 90 year old mother who cannot wear high socks and needs a non-binding edge. These are perfect for her. Easy to put on and comfortable with binding or cutting into her legs.
B00FSJWJX4|5|Repeat buyer
B008XFATEG|4|Shirt is nice but runs very small
B0062X3JCU|4|I'm a solid size 7 (36/B), so I ordered the medium. Due to the way it fits - very clingy like spandex, I should have gone with a large. However, when I get back to my normal size (2-4/34A) it will fit well.<br /><br />It's soft, the material is not thick, but it's not see through. It's VERY cute. However, if you get it too small it will be rather unflattering if you have any extra weight on you.
B00BMZ5W3W|5|I am very happy with this purchase.  I couldn't find anything in my area & took a chance on this one.
B008LXSKBY|5|I get lots of compliments on this dress. Its very comfortable and I'm able to wear a regular bra with it.
B00PU7HZ56|3|Cute, got a lot of compliments definitely order a size up. I'm 5'7 went right above my ankles ...  And 130 pounds, ordered a large . very thin material. But cute!!!
B00VTV7E5S|5|Nice and long, thin but sturdy cotton.
B00KDC6VXK|4|Exactly what you expect when you order.  Sturdy quality and fits like it's sized.  Minimal shrink.
B0077HYW12|5|I got these to run in when it got too warm for pants.  I don't like shorter shorts, and it's surprisingly difficult to find longer shorts.  I wore them for a half-marathon in the rain, and had no chaffing at all.  I ordered the medium, and it fits great.  For reference, I wear 8-10.
B001F6GOR6|5|I agree with the reviewers before me, this runs a bit tight so get the next size up if you are not a fan of legging style running pants.  Other than that, great product!
B00CO97HZQ|3|They were ok ... After one wash they did get very linty. Good for housework.
B00KASTGP2|5|great belt
B00FQN4O6C|5|The shirt was great quality and a bit less expensive than in the stores.  Good value.
B00CBFX4YQ|5|They are wonderful, had some for 3yrs I received as present, love them . I absolutely will order more of these fantastic socks, very comfortable !
B00ID9NXJ0|4|It was a gift.
B0007YXTOI|4|Fits nicely, and it is very pretty.
B00A3UU4D0|3|Not really what i expected. More of a costume than a dress and its so thin and long
B000IBUEHU|4|I bought the xxl because I wear a womens size 20.  This barely fit me.  I was hoping it would be bigger. But it is a nice sweatshirt.  Love the black and pink!
B00440CYD8|5|Very nice bag.  Bought as a Christmas gift for my son.  His looked mighty raggy when he visited a couple of weeks ago.  I'm sure he'll like it as much as I do.  Very well made.
B00LTSBSBW|1|- Star.  Poor Quality.
B008RCJ8TC|3|I needed a dress for my daughter's dedication and I couldn't find a dress like this at the mall. so I read the reviews and I made the purchase! The dress arrived rather fast, but I wasn't too pleased with the quality of the dress: The bottoms on the back were very loose,the beads were falling off the thread, there were loose string everywhere. Sizing was another issue, I'm glad I read the previous comments, because my daughter usually wears 12-18 months, and I crossed my fingers and ordered size 6months, I have to say it was still somewhat  big and slouchy on the shoulders.<br /> The only reason I gave this dress 3 stars is because my daughter got one wear and she looked beautiful in it, but I still can't ignore the fact that the quality wasn't what I expected. If this dress was at a store where I could personally see it , I would not have paid more than $20, just my opinion!!
B005P78BY0|4|Hood is very cute and a great novelty item. However, the zipper pocket as mentioned in the description is nonexistent.
B00I9JWVLA|5|The lace is very pretty and the colors are nice. I bought a small/medium because I saw on other reviews that it is a pretty tight fit. I am usually a 30A or 32A and it fits very well for my body.
B004N8UDRU|5|Bought this as a gift for a friend. This shirt is hilarious! And fit true to size.
B00BWFW71W|5|All the new rage. I loved that there were 25 of these with such a variety of colors and variations.
B00B2B6IVQ|5|PRETTY COOL SHIRT!
B00CPW2CUC|4|Looks nice but was way to big. Loose cut made it nice and roomy however definitely needed a smaller size
B00NFZJRUG|4|Great for Halloween. Material is of cheap material. No push up, so if you're small chested, you might need to pad these suckers up. Otherwise, not bad at all for the price.
B002D8X9TG|1|Upset that I got ONE SINGLE $10 pencil. Description needs to be fixed. I thought that I was getting a set. What a ripoff. Be WARNED!!
B007OVO9BO|1|Not bad looking however very poor quality fabric.  Leaves a trail of lint balls wherever it travels.  If you feel like taking the risk, I'd recommend washing it multiple times (by itself) immediately on receipt.  Personally I'd just look for another product line.
B00B75R32U|5|Perfect fit great quality lite weight  also useful finish is great quality also going to order up some for xmas gifts
B007AK1L9W|5|My grandson loved these socks..washed well...would buy again
B00D1113GU|5|It turned out to be exactly what I wanted, size, model, colour,everything was perfect and my litle daughter loved it.
B001GIUDK2|5|I had this in my amazon cart for over a year. I finally ordered it for my birthday. I'm so glad I did! The one I got is similar to the one in the picture. It's beautiful, light weight and well made. It's very flattering  and my husband  loves it on me. Bonus, this being a wrap skirt,  my ten and 13 yr olds wanted to try it on and it fits them too. That may not be a bonus if your daughter steals your clothes though. I can't wait for summer to get here. I'll be wearing  this a lot.<br />My normal sz is 2 and I'm 5'5&#34;, 100 lbs. This  would also fit almost anyone that is a bigger size as well. And as I said, those smaller than me.
B001EIWVAE|5|I bought this for my father, he is a pilot and used it every day, still look new, the quality is great, I will buy him again another one.
B00QQW71IK|5|Love it fits great and I look good in it to
B00BLQK836|4|Very dark blue, almost black.
B00FGL9HQQ|5|I buy all my night gowns from Eileen West. As usual, happy with this gown. Very nice feeling thin flannel. Great quality, comfortable and oh so beautiful looking. Love this brand.
B00DR7CESY|5|I ordered one size up and the dress fits perfectly.
B00KI0R6WW|5|This company gives you product that is worth as much as twice its cost.  Excellent ship and product...buy yours from them!
B002K9S1QE|3|This purse looks nice, but it is easily damaged my anything coming into contact with it. It is also difficult to keep it organized. I would recommend this to someone who doesn't plan on using it very often.
B00KDHHAO4|4|Size 12 is rather for age 14.
B0047VR0ZQ|5|Warm, flexible and attractive. Only catch is that they run small. So order one size LARGER than you normally would.<br /><br />My wife liked them so much, she made me buy a pair for each of my daughters!
B008OGWQJ0|5|This was much nicer than I had expected.  It is soft, feminine, the colors are rich.  I gave this as a gift for my mother-in-law.  It is very pretty and I love it.  I would buy this again for myself!
B005M0HWJ0|5|I love this sweater.  It is really well-made and has the look of quality.  The cashmere is soft.  The weight is not heavy so it is comfortable all day.  In terms of size, I really like the way it fits.  I am 5'5\\" and 116 pounds and I bought a small.  It fits perfectly and isn't too tight or clingy.  The button detail on the shoulder is a nice touch.  I would buy this sweater in other colours.  It looks great with a chain necklace close to the neck and would also be great with a silk scarf.  Overall, well made, good looking, for a good price.
B00EEGRK2W|5|Can never go wrong with this style, it's my go to bikini top.<br />I already have a number of them in different colors and prints, very comfortable, stylish and sporty at the same time.
B00DL1Y2M2|3|Go one size up, the sizes run small, size 10  fits more like a size 8. I love the skirt but it runs small
B00DF3YW8A|5|good tie ,if i would to buy it here it would cost more
B00GIA33DW|5|Not bulky. Good for layering and indoors. Bought it for my aunt and she loves it.
B000UZEBXW|2|UFO 40\\" Purple Camo Wideleg Pants are not suitable for indoor use. Well, maybe in a freezer or ice rink. The fabric does not breath. I got them in pink as well, and the fabric was the same. It's like Gortex or something. Within a few minutes the air inside the pants, which doesn't escape, becomes body temp. That may not sound bad, but it's sweltering, stifling, and sticky. You're trapped in 98 or so degree heat, so you sweat. Then they stick. Really stick. Static cling has nothing on this. It's visible to other people, as it bubbles and pokes at odd angles due to the stickiness.<br /><br />If I were going dancing, and I knew the entire club would be 98 degrees and humid with no air flow whatsoever I might wear these, because it would feel the same either way. No, wait...I wouldn't go dancing at such a place.<br /><br />I have worn them sledding, and they're great. Nice and warm. Unfortunately, they are pretending to be dance pants. Don't take them dancing. Take them snowball fighting. They are Snoball-Fight Pants. And they look just like in the picture.
B00J7L34IS|4|I would give it 5 stars but the top piece of the swimsuit has the support wire thing sticking out, but it's still perfect and I can't wait to make people jealous. It's too adorable!
B00NII8346|1|no size
B004QF0THO|5|Warm socks. Bought for my husband to help with his always cold feet. He loves them.
B00V5RS8XI|4|I love the top, it's super cute on and fit as I would expect size wise. The fringes weren't as long as shown in the picture but still is very cute. the only issue i had was one of the underwires had came out and was just hanging out inside the packaging with the top but I don't need a lot of support so I just removed the other as well since the underwire would not go back in. I do not like the bottoms however. The fit overall is OK but the legs are very tight. Shipping was OK, sooner than the posted date but still took a while as was coming from China.
B00IO2EWXM|5|Great fit, super versatile, good price.  Karen Kane stuff never disappoints.
B00KSFNM5W|5|I ordered 3 pairs of shorts from this company and all fit great and comfortable. Order came early and I was very pleased with the products. I also received a free pair of socks . Needless to say very happy customer and I will be ordering more products from here
B00CCM4IHA|5|Very comfortable! I get compliments every time I wear these.
B006RHNT3K|5|These colorful striped socks came quickly and they fit my 13 month old perfectly. I purchased the 6-18 months pack. They are quality made too. Ordered some other socks from a different brand and they came way too big, will have to wait until next winter for him to use. So, very glad to have these!
B005Z6IS80|4|Nice, thick leggings. They feel less like tights than most leggings do.  Haven't had them very long, so can't speak for endurance, but so far I'm glad I have them
B00OK500R4|5|Nice product!
B00MFEA47I|3|I like the socks but they were a little big and the color was supposed to be red but they were more of a red orange
B00UYTS77A|3|Although I am size 8/10, I should have gone for a Small size as the medium is loose on the chest. Else the material is nice and summery and looks exactly like the photo... Didn't like the belt in the back though.
B000MX3Q60|5|I have purchased this same style of Bra locally for many years now and loved it. But I can no longer purchase it locally so I bought it here. It's super comfy,decent support for bustier women without the annoying underwire, but after months of wear the straps start to rub and dig my shoulders a bit, but I use it as a cue to replace it. Would highly recommend this bra. Also an added benefit is it's nice and natural shape in the cup so no cone boobs!
B00TIADSOS|3|I'm going to use this for layering, so I hope the things I wear over it will keep me from looking pregnant.  There's a lot of material, and it's somewhat stiff, and stands out, and makes you look larger than you are- a problem with some of the Caribbean Joe clothes.  They seem to think plus sizes women would enjoy looking pregnant- no thank you Joe.  Been there,  Done that.  So I can tell you this is decently made, and the lace isn't bad- but it's not super flattering.
B0037995Z2|4|These socks are really soft. They were really bright before the first wash, however by wash number 3 the colors have faded and one of the pairs already has a small hole in it. For the price I was hoping for a little higher quality, but they are nice and soft.
B005H3BCBQ|5|Bought for a nephew's birthday to go with the Batman socks he had already. He loves them.
B0041OLI66|5|Nice wallet, this is one of the best wallets that I have owned. My wife purchased this for me as a gift. I was very happy with her purchase.
B00HYOIS9K|5|too small and too long for me.
B00R4IBXM0|3|itchy fabric
B00IKFYNCS|5|Love this hat! Love the color & the fit. It is adjustable to fit anyone.
B004NBY3D2|3|I would recommend the pants if it is not a bit too tight.
B008BWGYXG|5|Well, I bought this skirt for my wife. She earlier saw a flared skirt, which she wanted me to buy for her but I chose to add this not sure how it would look on her. I couldn't wait to see her try it on an whao! what a fit! She described it as being very comfortable, trendy and just the right fit. For me, it brought out a great figure of my wife (of 16 years) that I have never seen before. I will SURELY purchase 2 more!<br /><br />Keep making such lovely skirts that'll keep husbands at home. I love it!<br /><br />De-wales
B004GGUAH2|5|Very good quality, it´s very soft and the graphics looks durable. It fits a litle wide but it doesn´t matter it looks just great
B000BP8FY2|5|The scarf arrived as promised and is very pretty. It has a sort of iridescent shimmer, as one other person noted, and I like that I can wear it with either side showing. It has a soft cool feel to it, and its length is such that I can, and do, wear it in a variety of ways. For the price, you can't beat it. I only wish I had dressier events to attend so that I could wear it more often!
B003H2CKHO|5|My son was so happy when he saw it and now he can't wait for it to rain so that he can show it off to his classmates.
B00KRELOTA|5|kinda hard to get into, but once im in it, i feel great. but the boobage area is kinda itchy
B00CA6SDE2|5|Love it!❤
B005DJ8L18|5|Got for my daughter's second Christmas and it is just so cute!  A little pricey for children's wear, but I bought it, right? :)
B00E1L87YK|3|This blouse looks good online however; when I received it reminded me of Charlie Brown’s shirt lol. It did not look good on me at all nor did it hang off my shoulders.
B00EP8ZLVG|5|Great fit and really comfortable
B00O9LD85K|3|It was a little small in size, but arrived on time.
B00L65T9VO|4|I have other Bali bras in a 36c. I bought these in a medium based on other reviews. I thought this may be too small, but the band actually stretches and doesn't hurt. It is super comfortable and easy enough to wear all day/night. Would buy again!
B007SZL8MO|1|pieces missing!
B002HJ3FMM|5|I bought these in Macys last year but they quit carrying them.  These socks are soft, warm and they stay up!
B00KOQTFI8|4|Good knee highs
B00N3XFMRC|2|A nice sweater but too small. I bought a 3xlt and it was not long enough and tight.
B00FFJDICS|3|I rated this as-  fit as expected because it would not allow me to review it without identifying the fit, but, it is a gift so, I do not know how it will fit.  It is much thinner than I expected it to be.  You can see right through it.  It is meant to be worn over a complete outfit.  The silk is not as soft as I expected either it feels more like polyester than silk.  The print is as expected gray and yellow. I got it heavily reduced in price.  Overall, it's just okay.
B000IZBP5Q|5|I absolutely LOVE this hat: it keeps my head warm (it is a cap, after all), and it is an excellent conversation-starter.  I take it with me on every camping trip that I go on.
B0003DKTPU|5|Very very nice. Well made. So easy to wear & are very comfortable. Wear pants. Secured belt. Slip hooks under belt. I hook rear first then secured front hooks. Ready to go.
B005ZMK6JS|5|I ordered the black color which is a safe choice for me. The snap on buttons are kind of thin and not a very great quality. The fit is excellent though! I am a standard small US and I purchased the medium Asian size.  Made of thin fleece like material and a bit stretchy so be careful with washing, do a quick or delicate wash; cold-cold and hang dry. For a less than $35 dollar value I think its a great buy. Amazon offers a safe and great customer service for a worry free purchase. Buy it!
B002WLVLTE|3|I ordered this tie to match my dates dress for an event we will be attending later in the month.  Usually I would never buy clothing from an online source. I could defiantly be described as a clothes horse, most of my suits are tailor made and, I have most of my shirts made when I travel (mostly in Italy). But I was having trouble finding this shade in a brick and mortar store, so I decided to give this a try. When it arrived I was a bit disappointed with the quality but hey for the price it's not bad. It's by no means an Italian silk tie but for what I paid it's not bad and Ill defiantly get some use out of it. The cufflinks are trash however but the value for the tie alone is not at all bad
B00D05UD9U|5|great pants
B0007KVLEM|5|I will be using this later but plenty of room for everything.
B001MLDMTC|5|I enjoy the sock guy's products.  This is my third pair, and I will purchase or receive more in the future.  They are well made socks that hold up.
B00FZR1C0K|1|We are going on a cruise and I wanted to purchase a bunch of new underthings for my wife. They are awful. She's a true size 6 in every other maker, and used to be in Hanes. I don't know if these are seconds or what, but I'm never purchasing Hanes again.<br />Pros: Cheap<br />Cons: Several were so badly made, they didn't fit first time around. The rest shrank so much we'll have to throw them out.<br />Disgraceful.
B00JRYL2B6|5|I love it, makes me look cool for the summer
B00APUTYWA|5|A beautiful hoodie. I've received so many compliments on it!
B002ABLIBM|5|I got a size small and am 5' 5&#34; 140 lbs. and it fit perfectly! I love the way this coat looks and fits
B00LVJ9V3G|4|So happy with purchase, husband 6'6 and loves shirt covering him!!
B00006J9HE|5|What a deal!  This is one of the nicer quality items I have purchased from Marshall Fields.  Heavyweight fabric, stitching is nice and tight and sizing is right on.  This will look great with jeans or black pants/skirt.  More sophisticated than the average peasant style blouse.  Definately would recommend.
B006FCNUPO|1|this product, like several others from this seller, is an illegal unlicensed copy of an original design by Randall Munroe, the author of the popular XKCD web comic. Please do not purchase it - support independent creative artists by purchasing the original version of the shirt from XKCD, instead of supporting ripoff artists like this one.
B00U7YVKDK|1|Horrible quality.  The case has already started coming away from the metal at the top.
B005KOJ1UG|3|They fit my husband but look like they are going to wear right through pretty soon and he has only worn them a couple of times.
B0014MGAYS|1|Doesn't fit any brand of onesie I have: caters, first moments, just one you, old navy, gap, American apparel, Gymboree, bru, or gerber.
B00ND9NB10|5|Purchased this shirt as a gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it!! She is so excited to wear it in front of her retired teacher friends! Great fit and color! True to size! I would absolutely recommend this!
B00MVA48HS|5|Wife loved it.
B002ITRKBI|2|I think if they have to be unknown assorted colors, they should be neutral. Also pricey, better to order gDiaper starter kit. We do like the gDiapers and the gPants!
B000AIEA0I|4|Have worked very well to create a breeze
B0061QG3BM|4|Good quality shirt, sizing chart is accurate, and the words to &#34;The Raven&#34; make up the picture of Poe. Very nice.
B00EYW4MDQ|5|I just purchased this costume for halloween this year.i just got it today.took it out of the bag and its exactly as shown..no surprises and very cute!! defiantly pay attention to the sizes and what they are meant to fit.i got the medium and it fits perfect..its a bit showy in the chest and butt area so make sure youre aware that your booty will be hanging out...but i am in love with it.got yellow furry boot covers to go with it and i can't wait to wear it for halloween!!!
B0073XG6BY|4|Such a cool product I get complimented all the time. But $15 bucks is just steep for what it is... a novelty item. You can buy a really nice wallet at target for $15. perhaps a lower price tag to get 5 stars, as of today only 4
B007GR68ZG|3|so.. its not how it looks in the picture.. dont get me wrong, its.. cute. because of the picture I thougt there was going to be white underneath, and long in the back. I ordered an extra large (1x), I could have gotten a large but if I did that the front would have been under and in my arm pits more then it already is. its very short... the quality is great but the picture is not what you order. The shipping is GREAT! so fast! but just know id is not what you see in the picture.<br /><br />the link below is exactly what it looks like on!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Ooh-La-White-Shrug-medium/dp/B008EDXGTM/ref=sr_1_45?ie=UTF8&qid=1353834941&sr=8-45&keywords=stretch+lace+shirt
B00JIEWX72|5|Gorgeous large bow. Very reasonably priced
B0048BJP8K|5|I've never seen anything like this pin, not even at stores that sell comic paraphernalia Very unique addition to my DC pin collection. This definitely gets my 5 stars.
B00K5T9O3K|5|This hoodie was just what I needed! It fits just as expected and is super lightweight. Even with it being lightweight it keeps in the body heat very well allowing it to keep you warm. I would recommend this to everyone.
B000I7GLMG|4|Too difficult to put on.  Sock twists as you pull it up.  Hard to \\"seat the toe and the heel.\\"  GREAT, once they are pulled up..
B001ARORLU|2|Poor quality item.  Looks nothing like the photo.  Comes squished up in a plastic envelope and can't be untrained from looking squished up.  Do yourself a favor and spend a couple of more dollars on something better.
B00DH2I848|5|I received the shrug quick and in perfect condition. The large fit very well (I'm a size 10) as seen on the picture. I like it a lot and ordered one in white as well which I should get any day now..
B0091IDTKU|2|Machine crocheted. See through. Cute, but you can't wear it in public. &#34;Shawl&#34; and &#34;skirt&#34; are oddly shaped.
B008UDH25A|4|Very soft; my kids love it and try to wear them everywhere and all the time.
B0030BELE2|4|nice and solid belt. I like how easy it is to switch from brown to black. So far it has held up really well.
B0084EFW84|5|Very adorable....my two year old daughter loves it and all the kids in her daycare want one n went im out everyone mentions how cute it is....its a lot bigger then what I expected since my daughter is pretty small but she can grow into it
B00E6OH5G8|2|Great looking and fitting pants..Had to return after one wear, the zipper wouldn't stay up.
B000CESGB4|2|I bought 4 pairs (selected 1 item, quantity of 4), and all 4 pairs had identical cardboard markings, and all 4 say the same size on the fabric tag, but the product number on 1 is different, and that one is about 4 inches smaller.  The 3 fit, but one does not even though it says it is the same waist size.  Not exactly sure where the failure is, but it is a problem.
B00J9Q5D0I|4|Wasn't expecting the material to be so slick, but it is stretchy, comfy, and opaque (besides the lace) and looks great!
B00VHWNU84|1|Very poor quality.not even wearable
B007GGC0QI|2|The dress was the same color and the same cut. But the beading design was different than what was showed. The side wasnt sewn properly and the top of the dress was twisted...after having it altered slightly it worked for the purpose needed.
B00FMWOUQG|4|This dress is great. Its cheaper material but it is great for the price i paid. The white is pretty see through, i had to wear a long thick white tank underneath it... Very very short also, im only 5'2&#34; and had to definitly wear tights. If i raise my arms, it is not a dress anymore. But great for price!
B0030VR1FS|5|This is a super nice quality raincoat, but one thing I noticed about it, was that it made me sweat which resulted in the coat sticking to my arms. It became so uncomfortable, I took the coat off & decided that getting rained on was better. There must not be very good ventilation to prevent this. Too bad because like I said, it is a really nice coat.
B003AIKWHK|5|Great product. My baby sleeps in these every night. I just wish they were a little cheaper. I'd only buy him these clothes if I could afford it.
B00KNSE050|5|Very cute and fits perfect.
B00IX9DH64|5|I didn't like the one color they sold at the play concession stand.  I got this in a color I wanted cheaper than at the play, heavy quality too,
B000O7PBDA|5|Excellent Seller and Product!! Excelente Producto y Vendedor!!!
B007CG3GY2|3|Too small, no give. Great looking shorts, but just didn't work for my husband.
B0044XHLTC|5|I do love these scrubs! Keep in mind that they will shrink a bit once washed and dried several times. I'm 5'1'', 110 pounds and I wear an XS top and XS bottoms (petite). At first I thought the top was a bit roomy, but after a few washes it's definitely become smaller, yet still fits well.
B00NSJ5N20|1|the material is beautiful but it is the smallest thing in the world I bought a 2xl cuz I heard it runs small so I got 2 sizes bigger and then when I put it on it fit like a xs I want to send it back but I'm sure it will cost a lot of money I might have to sell it to a friend
B00B9X4XQO|3|Went up a size and it's 2 sizes smaller...
B00VVZ26CS|4|Great fit, hoping it's not going to bleed or fade when washedm
B00M41LL6U|3|In person, this is more of a mustard yellow.  It's Ok, but I wouldn't buy another one.
B00KDG5ZP6|1|Fabric and print are , but mine came with a big hole running along the seems.
B00DMGTVNG|4|these socks are nice, they seem to be nice quality.  a couple of them are a little tighter around the ankle than their partner.  the description saya no-show socks, they are not.  they actually come up over my ankle
B00816Q25C|5|My boys wear them to school. Great Boxers especially for the price. I got a better deal here then anywhere else!! thanks again!!!
B004ILUARK|3|I bought to have long slipper socks with tread but they quickly slide of my size 7 feet.  Only good for a couple hours at most if your legs aren't thick enough.
B00KDP29KQ|5|Love it! Beautiful design and perfect weight.
B00XWJYRKK|5|Nice, soft shirt. Fit well, and washed well (follow washing instructions) The only problem is the shipping time. Of course it arrives on time if you give yourself a three week window to deliver a simple T-shirt to my mailbox!  Delivery times have gone downhill.
B001CZCV86|4|So cute.  I get tons of compliments.  These socks are great because they rarely fall off, unlike a lot of other baby socks/shoes.  It's also nice to have the shoe on the sock.  They're very cute and a good thickness.  The flower was easily pulled off one sock by an intrigued 4-month old.  The size is small.  I might fit up to 6 months, but probably not long after that, unless the feet are tiny.
B00IOXLFHM|3|The antlers were awesome, actually made of foam. But they come with some cheap sort of rubber band instead of a headband like I thought. Was not happy. So I glued them onto a headband and it looked great. Just disappointing that the cheap rubber was sent.
B00DH6MJ5S|1|The socks showed and wouldn't stay on my heels. Threw them in the trash. Don't waste your money on these.
B0009GGR7K|3|I purchased three size large shirts.  I washed one shirt but it shrunk so i returned the two I had not taken out of the package. I might buy another in a larger size.
B000ZHGBU6|5|I bought these for my wife to go with her anniversary outfit. They looked great, were high quality and stayed up all evening.
B00K3HH57Q|1|Item was torn, was gift for Granddaughter who lives out of town, wasn't worth cost to return item. Had to get someone to repair a brand new dress
B00775MMQ6|5|This lingerie piece is perrrfect!!! Great material, super sexy, and covers problematic areas...while also making you look and feel like pure HOTNESS!!! I didn't think a curvy woman like me could pull off the side openings, but the way
B003UYTF4A|5|Awesome seller and product
B004FG6ETQ|5|i like
B0089F8G86|5|Good quality socks. Fits 8.5 wide very well. Going to get more.
B00NSHN0RW|5|Parka is really cool, fits perfect and makes you look slimmer! Actually, it is not for -20°C, but good for cold and windy weather.
B00I9IINCM|4|They run a little big
B00CMXZGNO|1|I thought I was ordering a women's medium, it said women's sizes....but it was actually a Jr's medium......
B00IUHCSE6|5|I love that this is a tee that covers, and the color is great for fall.
B00VAA6MPG|5|I loved this shirt it fit my son just right I like the picture on it. I got it on time.
B00JPL8VV0|5|Love it! Soft feel, stretchy and very comfortable. Emphasizes you butt very nicely!
B00GTLJ5GE|5|Love it, wish I had some in other colors!
B007IJ7HXE|5|Good deal, just as advertised, has a bit of smell when first opened but it goes away soon enough. Recommended if you want a shemagh.
B00E6RJ284|4|I bought this suit for my daughters and they love it. However, be forewarned that the suit tends to run a bit small. My girls are tall and skinny for their age and I bought a size up thinking it would last them through the winter at least. I think we'll be lucky to make this last a couple of months because of the fit.
B00C2KETOY|5|Stylish bow tie.. I had my kids take pictures for the fourth f July. I thought this would look great on the boys. I was correct. Everyone love this tie. Fast delivery and great item
B00Q779DDA|5|Great hat!
B00HFP6Z2U|1|COMPLETE FAILURE  THIS SHIRT HAD ARROW MARKINGS  ON INSIDE THAT BLED THRU WHEN WASHED. SHRANK,FADED,COULD ONLY BE WORN ONCE
B00JQH9KVS|1|I love the RED, but the sewing is way off and crooked!  One shoulder (left side) is longer than the other. Chest and stomach area fit ok, but shoulder area is too tight where you cant raise your arms. I am returning this top ASAP! I love the chiffon flowing look, but the sewing is very bad.  Very disappointed!
B00PC5MNGC|5|Love this outfit!!
B00B5CTL4I|4|This is super cute and a good alternative to other brands. However it runs a little big and offers no support because it's made out of cotton. If you are busty, you probably couldn't where this out.
B00RCXKM0Q|4|Nice product
B00019A8SE|5|I love this dress. But why do you show it when it is not available?
B00C7J8NCO|5|excellent, very good product
B00K6AYV86|5|Great hat ! Fit as expected -got a million compliments on it during our vacation. It's very functional keeps the sun out and comes with an elastic band so you can wear it around your neck.<br /><br />One downfall it's comes a bit warped -so you will have to stretch it out and reposition it before you can wear it.
B00Q1EG2LA|4|Love this suit except for the torso is a little short.
B000QWDQR6|5|I will definitely purchase a Squeem again. It is snug enough to work, but it is not painful to wear.
B002G9UE8Q|2|I believe that when I ordered the jeans the choices included the 29 inch inseam.  However, when I received the jeans they were 30 inch inseam.  My actual inseam size is 27 inches.  If I had known that there was nothing shorter than 30 inches I would not have purchased the jeans.  I am disappointed with the website as when I returned after receiving the jeans they did not offer them in a 29 inch inseam.
B00BV2US8U|2|The overall quality of the jacket is good for a $50.00 jacket, I purchased the Navy Blue double breasted Turtle neck, I am 5'8&#34; and I weight 175 lbs, I have wide shoulders and 41&#34; chest, but my waist is 32/33&#34; so my midsection is pretty ok I guess. The jacket felt a bit too tight on the shoulders but not &#34;too tight&#34;, I give this jacket a 2 star b/c 2 of the buttons &#34;fell&#34; off come on!!! on the first try? right after opening the package? So if you don't mind re-sewing buttons yourself or paying to get the buttons re-sewn on a brand new jacket,  Uh and No  I don't have truncal obesity. To summarize:  overall the jacket is pretty good for the price, material is good, I liked the way it looked when i tried it on, the color is a little &#34;weird&#34; for a navy blue,sleeves were a bit too long for me.  It was just pretty upsetting to watch buttons fall everywhere the first time I tried it on. If the buttons were better sewn I would have given it a 4 or maybe even a 5 star.  Needless to say it went back the same day.
B00AG3YKP2|5|Got what I paid for!
B00L3BBZYU|5|I love it!
B006IJPT80|4|Yes, I would recommend this to someone.  Since my hair is rapidly declining, it was time to find a solution and this was it.
B004XUDMLM|4|Fits well and washes well. Mesh has not suffered from machine washing or wear and tear. Had my doubts when it first came but am very pleased.
B0092TO66Y|2|did not like the way it looked sent back
B000FE5LJ6|5|I was using Egyptian Cotton vests from India because I could not find comparable vests in US for the past 10 years. I bought this at Nordstrom last month and have now ordered more from Amazon. This is the best vest I have worn, it feels so snug, soft and nice on the body.
B00PN4TS1A|5|Fit was what was expected
B002A9K1CG|4|Pants are great. I have use them for years, however they are a little small for the size. Long lasting.
B00ZT3X6ZE|4|This such a beautiful top. I love the attention to detail and the fabric is so comfortable. The sizing was a little small and it fit and looked great. Its pretty enough to be a Friday night shirt but comfortable enough to lounge around on Saturday morning. This a a super cute, super comfy top and the price is such a good deal. I ordered a medium and they sent me a large but that was actually a good thing. I am bigger on top and I needed that extra size on top. The chest area is made small and it was tight across my chest even being a large. EVEN tho I wear a medium shirt normally. The shirt also has a mild chemical small to it when it arrived. That is why it only got 4 stars. I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
B00KZMDLFY|5|The perfect present !
B008V008MQ|4|Arrived earlier than expected, fits very well. Material seems a bit strange like a rain coat material and has a slight glossy sheen to it that I hope will wash out.<br /><br />I will update this review after washing this item.
B00O1NN2NO|5|Im 174 lbs 5'2'' and the xl fits perfect its suppose to be a lil tight thats the point of a body shaper to train the body i have been wearing mine the last  3 days not at night still to early to see results but it compreses my stomach enough to not eat the amount i normaly would resulting in a few lbs lost in the last few days i luv this shaper 100% suggest
B005QHQZTW|4|My son is built different in that he is skinny but has a badonkadonk. He loves this style of Levi's and they are all he will buy.
B004H8GIG6|1|They suck bad don't buy them buy dickies and they mad me put a star
B003EAIPWI|5|Very durable
B008QWB1B6|5|Supple fabric lightweight easy to fold and pack away very roomy hood covers past face for superior wind protection. Many large pockets.
B00ISRCCLC|4|Comfortable: form fitting without being too snug, don't ride up on thighs and good moisture wicking for when you're exercising or sweating.
B00EKT0DJA|4|the dress fit perfectly but way too long, hoping that the seanstress will be able to cut it with the sequins. but i do like it, the color is a bit darker than the pic but i was happy about that.
B002E4GBKS|5|My son loves this bow tie because it matches his football team and he can wear it with either his purple or white button down shirt.
B00F9LLEMS|5|I will be buying one for every day of the week because I work outside.
B00CEK9IG6|4|I bought these to go with a costume for an 80's party we are having this summer. They look fantastic! (And I'm not stick thin either and am extremely self conscious so that says a lot)
B00L4HDADM|2|Runs Small
B000VWAHB4|5|I am extremely pleased with this coat. It is well constructed and keeps me very warm. The price was unbeatable and the free shipping was a bonus.
B001XKMSCE|5|big effect and very cute costume... a must have for your next halloween  very good quality fabric  the only bad point is we couldn't use the lion feet with shoes to go outside... but our child is happy to use them as slipper :)
B00IL4L3C6|4|I am 5'2&#34; 128 lbs.  I normally wear medium so I ordered the medium and it was way to big.  I then ordered the small and it was still to big.  It is a super nice night gown with very nice embroidery, but it runs a lot larger than expected.  I had to send both gowns back.
B009D3E7EU|5|Love everything about this...the fit is amazing, the colors are great and I love Bowie.
B009USZW3I|1|I bought the shirt for my husband, who is a 2X.  I thought I bought a 2X, because that was the size I selected, and only when I received it did I find out that it is a 2X in CHINA!!!  So I gave the shirt to my 17 year old son, who is almost too big for it.  Ridiculous sizing.
B00CN47HS4|4|I bought this sweater because I really wanted to try out wearing an oversized sweater with tights but I didn't want to pay for what is being sold in department stores.<br />This product is of typical manufacturing standards from an Asian country abroad. I've bought a couple items from overseas that fell apart just by me taking it out of the bag, however this sweater didn't have any frays, it was evenly knitted and was exactly as I expected.<br />I am 5'9&#34; and not petite so I wasn't worried about it swallowing me alive, I ordered a large and it fit just fine in length and size. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because i haven't had it very long and the shipping time is long, but I'm a Prime member so I'm a bit spoiled in my 2-day shipping.
B008HO6EVA|5|I love squids so much, and I can't believe that there's actually a squid hat! I haves a purple ones. It is awesome, and it fits most sizes. IF YOU LOVE SQUIDS THIS WILL TOTALLY MAKE U WANT TO WEAR THIS EVERYWHERE!!I am not big on hats, but this is just way too awesome to bypass. If you buy this, I am sure that U will love it so much. They are the best ever hat!!!!!!!!!!
B00LHTF3F0|5|The lady loved it!  I was surprised by how soft it was.  Looks and feels great, wonderful product.
B00C18MB6U|5|Great dress. Tight at the legs but I love it with my heels on I could hardly walk. But I couldn't get a bigger size because the top woulda been big
B00DKSVPRQ|2|These looked awesome, but the product I got wasn't what I expected. Its comfortable, but looks cheaply made. The pockets are not sewn down on the inside and are just loose, so you have to tuck them around you when you put it on (they might get in the way or stick out otherwise). It's also a lot lighter grey than how it looks in the picture.<br />So it's not a horrible coat. I still wear it, cause it is warm. But it was a disappointment
B0009R4FVY|4|Nice quality. BE AWARE that it runs a touch small. I generally wear a small, but I ordered a medium and it's perfect. Light weight, wicks moisture well and no bra liner.
B00960QYPK|4|Even though I like the dress, the first time my daughter wore it, the top button on the back went missing. It`s the area below the neck where a child cannot touch the button, and the dress does not pull there either - like it would on the waist. So it`s a poor craftsmanship. Now I need to drive to the Jo-Ann store, 30 min one-way, an hour drive altogether, just to get the same button.<br />Update: I emailed the company and they sent me a few spare buttons.
B006G5YSJ2|5|I have bought this for a Christmas present for my niece.  It was excellently made and the Hello Kitty is a great size.  The picture doesn't do this outfit justice. It is a little more a cream color than white.
B00ZOEJ5ZI|1|Runs very small in size also the back isn't fitted vey well and quality is very poor. Disappointed.
B00NJ8EG14|4|I like the shirt but it's a little too big for me, so I will give it as a gift to a friend
B003I51RMY|5|I would recommend getting this shirt, this is the shirt I will be wearing for my beach wedding in Aug 2013. I opened the package and tried it on, a little big because I ordered a XXXL, but once I washed it it fit really nice and feels great!! I would recommend getting a bigger size because it will shrink being 100% cotton.
B001PNIDI2|5|If you are a normal skinny guy like me make sure you get the 36 inch or 38 because the 34 inch fits me just right but you never know if im gonna gain a few pounds here and there so always go with a few sizes bigger. Its a good belt for armed security/LEO/ or anything related.
B00ES6ENFA|5|I really like this t-shirt. It's stylish and unique, it's got class and rock n' roll, it's casual and elegant. It fits amazing!<br /><br />I'm 5'9'' and slim/fit but not muscular. Everything I buy in the US is size small. However, while it is recommended that I get Korean size Large (US Small), I decided to get Korean size medium (US extra-small), and this shirt fits almost like it was custom made for me.<br /><br />As most of the things I've gotten from TheLees, this is a quality product, made with great materials and paying attention to details. That being said, it's probably on the delicate side, so it may not hold on very well with rough handling, but if you take care of it, it can last for a long while.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this product!
B00BMDA6Y4|5|Great costume - bought size small for 11 year old (on tall side) and he was able to wear it fine, with some room. Good material for the price.
B00BKRMZRS|2|At first I thought the dress was perfect...the color, the flow, but after trying it on I found the dress is completely see through and clingy, it clung to my panties and showed all my lady business.
B00IUTJPL8|4|I loved it. It was comfortable!
B00KKVP1LW|5|good
B006WP6FH4|5|It's a nice blazer. It feels like a jacket, but stylish like a blazer. The hood is detachable and everything, so if you want less of a casual look, but I think it's great.
B00M0JBEY0|4|Strong fabric but you have to order a size up or 2 I order xxL  xxxL should fit perfect holds tummy real good
B00M3E60NW|3|Please note this is not a 'skirt' even though it looks like a skirt in the picture.  Read the description.  It is actually a sort-of thong and unless you order it 6 sizes larger than you need, it will not look like the picture.  When I say 'sort of' thong, I mean there are two triagular pieces with the side ties, and a longish string goes in between.
B00SGB60YK|5|Fit is perfect. For reference I'm 150lbs hip 42 waist 31 height 5.4. A bit muscular.<br />I bought both med and small in these and both fit well. The medium for me is comfortable but I like my tights to be like a second skin while letting me breath ... So the small is my preference.  I did the stoop test and not slipping ladies. And I a black woman with a sizable butt so that is crucial. Also no real see through. Of course if you wear underwear that is brightly colored then you will get a hint of it. But still not a blast of it. I can't wait to wear these.
B00KFOIILO|5|Nice cap, I like it, fast service
B00332FWA0|5|The quality and size was exactly as expected, and the price was fair.<br />What surprised me was the delivery before the expected time.<br />The taxes here in Brazil are quite expensive, so if it was delivered directly to me, I probably would not have to pay them because the merchandise and posting charges together where under US$ 50,00.<br />yours<br />Jacob
B00CPDB3A6|4|Loved them! Will be ordering more
B00CAJC6F6|5|This V neck full slip is made in Sri Lanka and imported under the Jones New York label.  It is made of a 92% polyester and 8% spandex blend.  For the most part the material feels smooth like silk but still has that slightly rough polyester texture as you rub across it.  The spandex makes it stretchy.  As you would expect, it doesn't feel like pure silk but is comfortable nonetheless.  From the nadir of the V-neckline to the bottom hem is about 26\\".  Depending on the strap adjustment, for most women the bottom hem will fall just above the knee.  It may show some cleavage depending on your build.  The slip has elastic spaghetti straps, each of which can be adjusted with a sliding metal clip.  The stitching looks clean and consistent.  The only decoration is a 1/4\\" strip of very subtle lace along the front V neckline.  The advertising copy states that the slip should be hand washed in cold water and line dried.  However the label on the slip says you can wash it in warm water (delicate) and tumble dry.  Since it is polyester, there should be no problem with machine washing and drying.  This is a comfortable basic weekday working slip.
B00HSYX8FU|5|Item arrived as expected. Looked great and fitted well as described. Recommended.
B000JIH8WQ|4|Perfect for sleeping!  Not to tight but offers support that is comfortable.  Easy for night feedings because you don't need to look for clips.
B00KHF1N2C|2|Material was not very quality and it was too small.
B002M87HRM|5|Been a Goorin Brothers fan for a few years now. Been eying the Vegas Fedora for a while now and found it at a great price here on Amazon. Very pleased with the quality and fit. 1st time I wore it I received a number of compliments. This one is in the rotation for sure.
B00XDV2TDO|5|This patch got me so many girlfriends.
B00AVWP2J6|5|I love the way it looks, fits and the support it gives. Looks and feels good to not mention sexy. I got it to ware for my fiancé as lingerie. But after trying it on and feeling how comfortable it is I will ware it with my more normal clothing also. Very happy I purchased it and that it can be versatile for every day ware as well. I would not however recommend the [[ASIN:B00AWL3Y9G Empire Intimates Women's Floral Jacquard Underwired 1/4 Cup Shelf Bra]] as it runs very small and is not comfortable at all or true to size like this one. I have tried some other ones also and none have been this comfy or true to size. There is another one that is more like real bra and not a shelf bra that I would recommend [[ASIN:B00AWL46CA Empire Intimates Women's Stretch Lace Peek-a-boo Underwired Open Cup Bra]] if you would like one of a different style. It to is true to size and comfy.
B00Q9YGCJY|1|There's no way to size this dress. The arms are small, the abdomen is large, and the skirt is just right. Normal shaped people should not purchase this.
B00DZI11N4|4|These gloves have a very nice look to them and do work well with touchscreen devices as advertised. I was able to navigate the screen on my Galaxy S4 without any difficulty whatsoever. They are pretty comfortable, but I would say that if you have slightly larger than average hands, then you may find that these are a bit tight, but not unbearably so. They will stretch nicely after a few times of wearing them.<br /><br />They will keep your hands fairly warm under average conditions, but if you are planning to be in extreme cold or outdoors for long periods of time then you may want to invest in a better pair because these will not get the job done in those scenarios. As far as quality goes, these will show signs of wear pretty quickly. After a few months of wearing these a few times a week they are already due to be retired and replaced.<br /><br />If are are just looking for some decently priced gloves that you can use with your phone, these will fit your needs. If you need high quality gloves for outdoor work, you may want to invest in a different pair.
B00CHQ5NA2|5|I really love this robe..as soon as you put it on it warms you up.  I gave 5 stars even though it is too long..I'll have to pay about $25 to have 4 or 5 inches taken off and I&#34;m 5&#34; 10&#34;.
B008TOUYAK|4|I have very very large breasts(38HH).  Have been through 2 very expensive Euro brand sports bras with underwire.  They started out great, but ultimately the underwire becomes problematic.  This was recommended to me.  Works great, even in zumba, and no underwire!
B000TXPZZS|5|Very pleased with the two leotards that I purchased.  They were exactly what I wanted.  Great color selection.  Size chart helped tremendously. Fast delivery.
B000IBNCN8|2|Since there is no stretch in the fabric, expecting the socks to fit such a broad range of sizes is unrealistic. I wear a shoe size 71/2 - 8 and the foot part is too long and bunches up in the shoe.
B00FC1ZAZW|5|Good proportions for jeans or chinos. The buckle and metal end piece have smooth edges. The mechanism adjusts easily and holds the fabric firmly - no slipping. I did a scratch test on the back of the buckle. The black paint doesn't scratch easily. Timely delivery. Not bad at all. Rick murkyvista.blogspot.com
B00FPSWSRU|1|Would like to exchange for a different style of Cherokee pant.  Workwear small/tall.  The luxe was way to short I am 5'8 and these are high waters
B000632SPG|5|My 19 year old son has never had a hat fit him properly. When he opened this gift for Christmas he ran to a mirror completely excited like a little kid to see himself in a ball cap. He LOVES it! It fits perfectly.
B00DH9ZR04|2|loved the color, but would not recommend for someone over a B. I got the largest size they offered, and gave it to a very very tiny friend.
B00FPEQTJM|2|It is more light yellow rather than off white/cream.
B00ISBDIDE|5|This was a gift and she love it.
B00JPT8COI|5|It's very cute
B002G9UDY6|3|Purchase them for the grand boys and love them .
B00ICHN2Z8|5|Good for price.
B00KQ1OMZW|5|Great
B0061IDX9K|3|There could be more tummy control, it's a flattering style and it runs a tad big. Nice color and good support in chest.
B000NDCHPA|4|I love this for wearing under shirts to hide my belly button in and provide extra support.  It gapes a little at the top near the bra band, but then holds baby snuggly around the belly.  It did not work well for me for holding non-maternity pants up and was uncomfortable to wear with full-panel maternity pants.  I mostly wore it as a long camisole.
B000QF3RM2|5|I bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter who is now a Big Sister to her sister, Harper. She was excited to wear it to school.
B00K5TCB9E|5|Other than the size, I love this bra.  It's so much easier to zip it then pull it over your head
B011SP3T8A|5|This swimming suit is adorable.....and sexy at the same time!  Fits perfectly.
B00KXPU1BK|4|I really enjoyed this cosplay of happy from fairy tail. The cosplay comes with the shirt, pants, tail, and neker chef bag. The only thing i recommend is that you give a few more inches for the custom measurements for the pants, especially if you have a bigger butt like me. The tail may need some work depending on your perspective, the white part is too long on the tip of the tail for me, Over all this is a really cute and fun cosplay.
B00R2L6WAW|5|Got my dress yesterday and its beautiful. I bought the darkest blue and it fits so nice without having any alterations. The sequences on the dress are limited to only a couple but the include a pin which gives the dress the look in the picture. Very pleased with this purchase and especially the price because I saved a ton of money.
B00WL1UKAQ|5|Just as it is describe and I love the product!
B00C5WBLV8|4|Runs a little big. The blue seemed a little bit off, too royal blue, but over all very good.  Thanks!
B00IUZF7ZU|4|I bought the rose blue and love the colors.  It is bright and beautiful.  It's very sheer and looks like it will snag easily.  However, even though I don't expect it to last too long, I bought two more of the same color because it is so pretty.
B004R8T5AC|4|They're really nice pants.. The thighs are slightly tight, honestly they just need a break in, but I'm quite chubby
B00M3NKDM2|1|I gave this shirt to my sister, I ask for a size Med. (10-12)  and she is a size 4
B007M4KB6K|1|Is not what i was expecting,  it looks so cheap not happy, i will keep the mask just because it will cost me more money to returned it back.
B007P4LHY2|5|beautiful color, nice length and just simply gorgeous.  Going to look for more colors.  I ordered for a Christmas present, but thinking about keeping it for myself!  Merry Christmas to me!
B005POVNMA|4|I needed a minimizing strapless for a bridesmaid dress with very little give - most strapless bras have padding and that just wouldn't work for this dress.  This bra is exactly what I needed, it's basically a little black tube top.  Easy and comfortable.
B005L3KIOY|3|The gloves were a little large for my hand - and the left hand wouldn't keep the 'mitten' on.  Also, I wanted to take photos but the gloves ended up being in the way.  They are perfect for my husband, whose hand is larger.
B00WS4ENKY|3|Looks very nice on. Better than expected.
B00R7JOT0E|3|The dress is REALLY CUTE, HOWEVER I'm 5' 5&#34; and the M-L size was too short for me (ending at the bottom of my butt cheeks). I let my mom wear it and she's 5' 0&#34; and it was even too short for her but she just wore another skirt underneath it so she could dance and sit without being self concious. Too bad these dresses aren't made longer - I would order other colors.
B000U63G1E|5|This was a great buy for the price and would use this site again!
B00KO1IRXC|5|Nice shirt..
B004GFY5DS|4|look and feel awesome
B000JHCYVM|5|This is a great product:  strong, durable, and comfortable.  Because they shrink, I'd advise ordering two sizes larger than what you typically wear around the waist and one size longer.
B004PYEFHQ|4|These gloves are so cute and nice to wear. Worth getting. Two small downsides. The strings come untied a good bit so make sure you have someone help you tie the gloves. The gloves like to keep going down your arm instead of staying at your arm where they are suppose to be. But not all clothes are perfect. Great buy and I recommend it to anyone who loves gloves.
B00CAXQV3K|1|The seams on the shoulders are bunched and do not lie flat and are knotted up.  The material is overly thin and is cheap.  Surprising since I have purchased Hanes tanks before, but not online.
B0093DRL7A|5|Beautiful dress! My flower girl will be wearing this in my upcoming wedding and it fits well and looks beautiful. The dress is pink and the tulle is white, giving it a beautifully soft effect. Excellent quality for the price! I added a few extra crystals to the waist for a little more sparkle and we are very pleased with it.
B00GY1HDAO|5|Loved them perfect fit great quality..would love another pair.  Can you send me the link to order another pair.
B00ACIFZ1Y|4|Fine
B00HYT8BJC|2|Looks sexy, but get what you pay for. Could be better made. OK for the most part but end of boning tore out of it's sleeve first time she wore it.
B00EZR1ZDU|5|I love the way it fits me I will most death order from you again just know that liking it when my waist shrinks more I will be ordering a smaller size from you so get ready ;-)..
B006SFSJCM|3|not stretchy as I expected.  I wanted to wear them under my normal clothes and they felt binding.
B007KFZHMY|1|runs small
B00POAEA02|4|These capris were made for guard girls without any booty... I ordered my normal size of pants and they fit everywhere but there. Also, the words down the right leg aren't on the front as pictured, but they are directly on the side and the bottom of the leg gets scrunched up so they are difficult to read at first glance. Otherwise they are very comfy for practice or sleeping in or anything, I just have to keep them pulled up!
B008KGTXJA|3|It fits a little bigger than expected. Bit i like the style and the feel, it is warm and comfortable.
B005GKDL8W|3|too big of a brim.  was looking for a 2 1/2&#34; it had a 3 1/4 sent it back
B00D8CV32Q|5|My husband loves these wallets. I have bought many of these and these were a great price. Lasts a long time and my husband is rough on wallets. My two boys now have one too, they are easy to use and small to carry and they do hold the dollar bills great.
B00IGHGCZQ|5|Absolutely beautiful!
B0076R6LGM|4|Fit is perfect. I took one star away because a couple of times when I put it on I heard the start of some sort of tearing. Seems like it may be a bit delicate but style is really really great. I give it 4.5, I look awesome in this.
B0085BAF92|2|damn hugeeer.
B00E1YRI3S|5|This is a great price for a perfect tutu! Not cheap looking.  I used this for my 5 year old Birthday party.
B003IYYEBQ|5|comfortable fabric, slimming and functional. fits on my target brand nursing bras. I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down. The small is very fitted and the medium would have been a little loose. I highly recommend and will likely purchase more.
B005S6CAAY|4|Beautiful gown, I am so happy I ordered it.  My daughter will look beautiful. One complaint was the security tag was still on the gown. I had to drive around town to find a retailer to remove it.  Frustrating first experience of ordering apparel through Amazon.
B00GO4LUW8|4|its listed as a 5/6 but fits like a snug 5. It is a good quality shirt for the $.
B00PN54JB8|4|Super cute! Shoes are a little big.
B00M78ZTYU|5|This is a very nice undershirt. As soon as I tried out the first one I bought, I ordered a bunch more. They cost a lot more than your average undershirt, but they're worth every penny.
B00E4RKCKI|3|Thinner fabric than I expected, but cute.
B0006U1IWS|1|These were listed as a 7X but actual size was a 1X.  Way too small for a 7X.  Not a true size and I would not recommend based on size.
B00ITJMDOU|5|they fit a little small and i'm suprised they fit my male friends but they have much smaller caves and are less athletic but i have really small feet so their is a lot of space in the foot i would guess
B00D7VJ5R8|2|Thin and not so soft.  For cheap Bandanas they're what you paid for.  Made in China always makes me cringe, and that's imprinted on every one of the thin bandanas.
B00I95KWLA|4|it looks a little small, this is a gift, hoping it fits, she will love it
B00BY3KS04|5|Amazing coat! I love it! It has a very slimming cut.  It's very light, one of my favorite features, but very warm.
B00FLCMUS2|1|Every LRG shirt I've bought is premium fit. This Shirt is standard fit. Nowhere in the add does it note either.
B000KEIWU6|5|My boyfriend didn't have a coat so I wanted to get him one for obvious reasons.  I read the reviews and for the most part, everyone said how warm the coat is so I decided to purchase it.<br /><br />Well I am here to tell you he LOVES his coat! His only complaint is that it keeps him too warm!  Now the coat is stiff and doesn't allow for much mobility.  Also, the sleeves are long and the coat doesn't have much give so I would suggest ordering I size up. I got my boyfriend a size bigger than what he usually where and it fit just right on him.  Again, it is a little stiff but do not let that discourage you.  Unless you are doing Kung Fu in the coat, you are still mobile.<br /><br />Overall, he loves the coat and is very excited to where it more.  I assume the coat will be less stiff as he wears it.  The coat is also machine washable which is amazing!<br /><br />Buy the coat if you have cold winters.  If you are down south and don't see much snow, this coat is too warm for you.
B009RNYQ4C|4|I really like this legging. The leopard print is very sexy and the imitation leather look adds to the look. I just wish the leg was a bit longer, and the crotch higher with a lower waistline. It makes the fit a bit odd, but I just wear it with a long tunic-style top to cover the waistline area and it looks just fine.
B00GSYCABO|5|Thank you for the fast delivery of nice item.
B00HFF6CYQ|5|This is a wonderful jacket. Good quality and have received many compliments on it, and the colors are lovely (coincidentally happen to be in the Disney Frozen color palette!).  My daughter does not like &#34;puffy&#34; jackets, and this one while it is warm and insulated is not too puffy for her tastes. She has played out in the snow in it many times already, and she loves it.
B001MQ86FM|5|I used the beard for a costume I made of the Sultan from Aladdin.  It need a little styling as it was too long and too curly, but I was able to make it what I needed it to be.  I loved it.
B009DQL97U|5|Perfect for any girl!
B00BF03MV8|1|This was more like a size 9-12 month. my daughter wears 18 month, and this 24 month was too small to go on.
B00OIF9HHA|5|Glad I read the sizing chart. Works great.
B00KCP65PM|1|I ordered and returned two sets of pants for the same reason. These are defective items with cheaply repaired cuts around the knee area. The cuts I saw on both pairs are about 4-5 inches long...and the fix looks like surgical stitches. You can see them a mile away.<br />On the positive side, the return and refund process was very smooth. Pay $10 more and get them brand new at the store...
B00HGRHOUE|5|Everyone loves my shirt including me.
B0092U7UGQ|5|I am getting into TBTB, Went and saw my friends band Written In Stone open for them. This shirt has very good quality artwork on it, nice material and just makes me feel good to be a fan.
B00OY88XDK|5|Exactly as pictured. Good quality. Fast shipping.  Haven't given it to my husband yet but I think he'll like it
B00N635ND2|4|Husband needed replacements for old denim apron that he uses in his machine shop. We bought 2 of these to start with and he found the quality to be very good. He works with grease, oil, grime, etc... all day. And he welds in these. Very durable. Plus I find them easy to launder. So we bought 3 more and have been very happy with the quality.
B008JRF0ZQ|4|Very good wig. Nice and silky, but it tangles easily. Might need to redo the braids.
B0064HHHC2|5|Great fit and color!
B005GYL9C8|3|this item is fine if you don,t have a lotsof stuff to put in it,but to keep things neat inout of place i'll say it's alright.
B00KN1AUB0|5|Perfect fit
B008JK3JFG|3|The case itself seems to be solid and well built.  I returned it though because at about 1.6 inches front to back, it was bigger than I want.  It's listed for the DV150F, but it has enough room inside for a camera twice that thick.  As a result, the camera actually bounces around a bit.  I exchanged it for a neoprene sleeve that's a better fit.<br /><br />It comes with a screen protector which would have taken some trimming to use on the DV150F.  It's generic and not matched to that camera's screen size.
B001OCQX1I|3|Good price on these athletic shorts, seem a bit large as I wear an 8, will definitely be cinching the waist.  thankful for the tie inside to do so.  haven't worn them yet so not sure how they are going to perform when running or working out.
B0035WTMNQ|3|This is more of a leisure bra than a sport bra. It offers very little support but it sure is comfortable. The straps do not adjust so there's no way to increase the support or remedy having them fall off your shoulders. It's soft and stretchy. I can sleep in it, it's so comfortably.<br /><br />I love it, for what it is. But as a B there's no way I'd be able wear it for any kind of athletic activity. Maybe if you're an A it would be a good sport bra?
B00O9ML08G|5|Love it
B00BFUFFOK|4|I loved the bathing suit! It was sized perfectly and it looks FABULOUS on! It definitely was a great buy!
B00D4IYDIK|5|my sophia loves it
B008LWVSBE|5|It was what I expected and these jeans are the best fits like made for me. Thanks and will buy theme again every day!
B00NF3WGSS|5|So beautiful, so much detail. It fits like a jr shirt rather than woman's, so be sure to order a size big. My friend loves it, it was a gift, she's worn it 3 times since I have it to her a week ago. The detail is so great I can't stress that enough.
B00LK0JG2W|3|The 32&#34; inseam is correct, but the shorter trunk means I have to wear them somewhat lower than my normal waist to have them reach my shoes.
B003LO1ZMY|3|I bought this for my brother for Christmas, he is 6'1\\" and it went down to his knees and was very wide at the bottom too...so it's made very long and big!!
B00LM4LMK0|4|I ordered my normal size (M). They took so long to arrive but besides that, they were huge. They were a 28 at the waist, the legs were huge, and I looked like a weight loss commercial trying them on. I managed to shrink them a small amount by soaking them in really hot water a few times and washing them. But they sit kind of big on my body. They are still cute though. I want to buy more because they are good quality and not a bad price.
B001UJ7YYA|2|I am always looking for Shapewear that will help me hide the belly bulge that remains since having a child.  The Maidenform Flexees Long Length Tank is okay, but not something I would use often.  I would say this tank is more of a smoother, than shapewear.  It smoothed out my midsection, but did little to hold it in.  And while I love the length, it is almost pointless, as it kept riding up my sides.<br /><br />Of all the shapewear I own, this is my least favorite piece, and one that I would not recommend to others.
B0029F26D8|5|I love this hat! It comes in one size. I was happy that it fits perfectly on large sized head and looks very elegant.
B00HNGWIPO|5|I LOVE these nursing tanks.  I have three now and I wear them every day.  They are long enough to tuck in or layer under another shirt or sweater. They are fitted so they help slim the postpartum belly.  They have two options for attaching to the nursing bra, so it works with every bra.  I love these and I want one in every color!  (I am 5'3&#34; and 133 lbs and I ordered small and they fit perfectly.  Love them!!!)
B00009ND7O|4|Just bought a pair of these Fuggs (Faux Uggs) last night! Super cute and soooo cheap. Though my husband thinks they're ugly (but then again, he doesn't read Us Magazine!), I love 'em. Only 4 stars because though I wear an 8 1/2 shoe, I had to get these in a 10 to get them roomy. The 9's were pretty tight and I didn't even have socks on! So I would suggest to go up a size so they're not so snug and you have room for socks. These boots are heavily lined, so I probably will not be able to wear them until November or December (I had majorly sweaty feet after wearing them for 1/2 hour last night). But I'm glad I got them now, because I'm sure they'll be sold out in no time!
B000Z98D00|5|Love the t's but they were too large for the man in detention center.  Can I return all but one?
B007U3ETRK|2|I almost couldn't even get it on.  I am 5' tall and wear a size 2-4 an it was small on me.  Otherwise it looked like it was well made.
B00856YVQ0|5|Love them.
B0083EZDS4|5|Getting a lot of compliments on shirt. sending you some customers
B008P7DG38|4|The dress is great. But the hoodie part isn't as big as I thought it was gonna me and the mini isnt so mini. Its a bit longer than Id like. But all in all great product. And it shipped to my house way earlier than expected.
B00KH820ZI|5|Tahari is good as always. Stylish, true to size and the price was unbelievable. Good for work or business casual
B00HWF8G1Q|5|Very pretty and comfy.
B009XFD4SS|5|Bought this as a giftq for my niece it looks as shown and appears to be of good quality
B00FH45CJ8|2|So the shipping cost on this is ridiculous. It could have been sent for a stamp. Product is overpriced. It is not worth it to buy. Make your own.
B003XZSZZQ|5|Very nice quality, I used this for a cosplay a while back and it still has it's form and is comfortable to wear. I did add pink to it, but it still is amazing to wear.
B00387EEYK|1|I'ts a bad product. I hate it and i hope i'll receive a great article next time. best regards. god bless you
B00SMGW82C|5|Good, product arrived as scheduled.
B001J3A12Y|2|While this is a pretty bra, it is not the most comfortable one.  The edges are so &#34;itchy&#34;, I find it hard to think about anything out else when I am wearing it (which is not much due to this).  I spend more time trying to scratch my back, than anything else.  Also, the adjustable straps slip, so the fit is never right.  Definitely a waste of my money.
B009S346XM|5|Beautiful dress and fit perfectly! It is well made and not see through like other ivory dresses I looked at.  Very happy with this purchase.
B002GHK35C|5|I purchased this bra with the intention of just wearing around the house since I thought there was no way a wire free bra can support my DDD breasts but I was pleasantly proved wrong. This bra offers a decent amount of support, I do not feel self-conscious when I wear it out of the house and plan on purchasing a few more since they are so inexpensive compared to my Wacoal bras.
B00DJK3DY8|2|I bought this to wear to a wedding. It's a &#34;one size fits all&#34;, and so I was optimistic. Maybe in the land of the elves it fits all. I couldn't get one leg into this skirt. It was very pretty, I must admit, but small is what it is, fits all sizes from one to five at most.
B00EUE32DY|5|I will be getting more of these for youth group.
B00DJMDMUQ|5|the pricing made me doubt the quality but i was excitingly wrong.  it is a PERFECT jacket.  great color (charcoal) - length & feel - very happy with the purchase
B009YG96DS|1|I expected more from Carhartt based on their reputation.  There are only three belt loops on the waist, which caused my belt to ride up every time I knelt or bent over. The triple-stitching is stronger than the fabric used to make them.  The crotch on these ripped (from the bottom of the zipper to the bottom of the waistband in the back) within two weeks of use.  Not buying this brand of scrubs again.
B00KZGSYHK|5|This is a lovely thermal top. So soft and warm. A great buy.
B00MRJ1MEK|3|started to return, but decided to hold on as I can use it to chill at home or make everyday runs to drs., etc.
B00K72RSCY|2|I like them
B00ODH25RM|4|nice dressers
B009X6TFF8|3|I liked this top, made me look like a peasant wench. However, go up a size, or your husband won't let you leave the house.
B006YBVTTU|4|Runs on the small side, so if you want it loose, order at least one or two sizes larger. Material is thin, which is okay for what I needed, good for layering.
B00CXSONFA|4|Large was a tad to small...  Great fabric...
B002F06ECQ|5|The fan is larger than I thought it would be - will be perfect in photos.
B00DUFNMES|1|Very cute jacket, but the zipper broke the same day my daughter got it.  I'm returning it for a full refund.
B005E041HY|1|I need to return this item. Tall means huge. I'm 6'00&#34; and these are way beyond tall. They need to have better sizing.
B007FOD3LM|4|stronger lock needed....can open in your pocket....<br />still a good value overall....good collectable grateful dead<br />recommend a buy item....ships quick
B004IR88K0|3|This dress is nice.  I think that they should show more of the model because I did not realize how short the dress was until I got it home.  It was too short for the event that I had planned to wear it for.  Maybe I will get  to wear the dress another time, but I have not worn it yet.
B0027VT5X8|5|Loved this!
B00HUS76LQ|5|Fit great.
B00DRJ7752|5|This goes great with my motif. The color is vibrant and appealing. I like this and all the patches I bought.
B00847H090|5|good quality and price. best buy. the buckle is no so fancy though. consider replacing it, overall would buy again.
B00OTNMUZC|5|My boyfriend and I love these sexy panties. I wasn't sure how they would fit me due to my round butt and small frame but I am pleasantly surprised. They make me feel sexy, and the price is hard to pass up.
B007BZ5WBO|2|It was too short in length for an XL and way too tight across the stomach and breast. Inside tag said XL though, so the wrong size was not shipped. The color and length of the sleeve were the only two good things about this shirt.
B00817ECB2|3|A gift
B00NF5HZ64|4|cute and comfortable top that looks great with yoga pants
B004XJL0TO|2|very small not for an average ladies. if you are size 0-6 it maybe perfect for you. colors are ok.
B006U3Q8FC|5|I love these little socks and I ordered them to help my son stop sliding on the hardwood floors but he now tries to slide the grips across the floor lol...
B00JGHM47K|5|Dress is beautiful and very well made! Bought my niece who is 4 the 5-6 and it fit perfect. The sizes run small so I would suggest buying a size up from what the child actually wears but all in all a great buy!!
B00KW1GISA|5|I love Kali!
B00DUXE9G0|5|I love this coat.  The fit is perfect for a woman.  I had been wearing my husband's barn coat all during this cold winter but wanted a coat of my own.  This is the perfect one....warm, attractive and great fit.
B00HGAP3HW|5|She looks so cute in the outfit. Still doesn't fit inshorts.  A little dolly.
B004Z91I58|1|The zipper is exceptionally poor quality, barely workable, and sometimes it can't be persuaded to zip at all. A note to the designers - make this a spring-closing case, zippers don't turn a radius well, especially a cheap zipper turning a tight radius. In the meantime, don't buy this, folks.
B007KM2AWW|5|I was very pleased with this product and it completely met my expectation.<br />I would recommend it to anyone.  It is comfortable, well fitting, and helps keep you dry during heavy physical exertion
B008ARIR0U|5|Great fitting hat, very good product
B00AHOQCSI|4|Looks good and well made. Good unisex gift for babies. Not all find out the gender so would be great for that.
B00UKHY8VU|3|Although flattering to the figure, this shirt is very &#34;fitted&#34; (i.e. tight) and quite thin (though not see through, even though it is white). I normally wear a Juniors small and bought this shirt in a medium because the other reviewers said it ran small (and they were definitely right). Even the medium is skin tight for someone who wears a Juniors small. I think I would have preferred this shirt in a large and I tend to like a fitted shirt. If you are wearing this shirt to attract attention, go clubbing, or to layer under another shirt, then you would not mind this shirt in a size larger than you usually wear. If you want this shirt as a work shirt (which is why I bought it) then you may want to buy 2 or even 3 sizes up (it's stretchy so it will fit more like a regular shirt if you get a much larger size). Though, in all honesty, this shirt is too fitted and thin to really be an appropriate work shirt. Despite this shirt being so tight, it was a relief putting it on because it was not sheer, which is a rare thing these days for some reason when it comes to white shirts.
B004XH5YZM|4|Was a great jacket, fit as expected ,but if the guy is long it will be a little short but over all would defiantly buy again Columbia makes durable clothing
B00H7LDL38|3|I got to wear it only a few times before it began to act up. My boobs would simply pop out after wearing it for a bit. IT was annoying however it is rather cute
B0007Z17XM|4|I've switched from using pounds of facial tissue to using washable handkerchiefs. I was particularily looking for informal, soft, cheap white 'kerchiefs. These fit the bill.  A little stiff coming out of the package, but after washing, became soft and gentle on my delicate nose. I like that they are quite thin, light and small - I tuck them into my pocket for hiking, keep some in my purse and my car.  Apparently, I blow my nose a lot!  I've washed mine several times and the hems have not unraveled - not a single one. Handkerchiefs are hard to find and these worked out well for me; in fact, I'm purchasing another packet.
B000I8HZRK|5|I've been buying this bra for years and was disappointed when I had trouble finding it in stores.  Fits where it should... no under-boob, no spillage, no wires cutting in on the side, and lays flat against my sternum.  I'd say it might run a bit big compared to what I find in the store, but I'm not super familiar with other brands/cuts.
B000M9JJ9M|3|I got these pants to workout in and they are fine for that. I originally got the large and they were way too big. The medium is still a bit large but they fit well enough. My waist is about 40 inches but that's where I carry all my weight so my hips are narrower.<br /><br />I also didn't like the drawstring. It was a loop, so I cut it in the middle so it had two strings. I put a coupke of beads on the strings so they wouldn't pull into the holes.<br /><br />These pants are all right.
B00E1BHKVG|5|I usually order a medium in zip-up hoodies. I am 5'2, 125 pounds, and ordered an extra large, which fits like a medium. Great quality fabric!
B00DYY4SDO|5|It's perfect! It is definitely bigger than it looks. The strap length is great, and it offers a longer strap option. There are inside pockets to use plus the convenient built-in, padded laptop slot.
B001UJB43C|5|I have been looking for something that controls and firms without being constricting and hot. This seems to be very nice quality and I wear it all the time with t-shirt and jeans. The price was good also. I will probably order more of these.
B00IJENPI8|3|Sooo pretty but didn't fit at all! I'm a XL, and even though the size chart said it should fit my measurements, unfortunately it wasn't even close.
B00CPQG39E|5|Fits and attracts attention. Very well made but its pricey.
B000FW3W26|3|What I don't like about these visors is that the velcro is not a pulley system, but rather two separate strips on each side.  I am not a large person so by the time I have this tight enough to fit there are straps on each side hanging out over three inches.  If you are a larger man, or have a larger head, this wouldn't be an issue.
B00BPXFYDE|5|They're the best - ever. Look good new or worn. Simply love the quality & dependency. Try one & you'll own 10.
B00NO6AEA8|5|great product
B0084P6B8S|5|These are quite long.  I like that.  Usually stay-ups are very short on me (even though I am short), because I have heavy legs.  These ones are fantastic and were a very reasonable price.
B00DR90H72|5|great
B008AW982Q|5|Its batman it fits
B00LVSAT9W|1|Cut to small - ordered LARGE, came in looking like a SMALL.  Be careful of this fit.  Need more material
B00SSBZTIG|3|This dress was adorable, but the color looked to creamy, I would have liked it better if it were off white.
B008NT1DZG|3|It's okay
B00D97D1E8|4|They are comfortable and the fabric is what I look for in sleepwear.  I like the feel of cotton against my skin, particularly when sleeping.
B005M9ILUK|5|My grandson looked so cute in this.
B004W5MQG0|5|Came like the next day, super fast. Too cute, perfect, my daughter will love it, she picked it out herself.Just as pictures soft girly colors, but not washed out, just right. I don't like the bright shocking colors so this is perfect.Sleep wear or house play.A+++
B007N1CW78|5|I am a 34E and 4'10&#34;. Almost nothings fits me, especially online. With all the good reviews I decided to give it a try. The material is not cheap. It fits great (I ordered a medium). I purchased this with the school girl shirt to surprise my husband for his birthday. Great price! Great product!
B00275289W|5|Great!
B000KKUZIC|2|The socks are nice but won't stay in place; they keep falling off in my boots.
B005ITTU2M|5|Very cool!  These items were in all the stores last year at over $30.00. The price on this is great. Loved it!
B00K17EQJS|5|Is beautiful, I love it!
B00CY3Z4Y8|5|Fits wonderfully & the material is so soft also! I could sleep I this!!!
B008P7YSX0|4|The blouse is good for avg daily use.  The color is really pretty.<br />Fabric is light so it's good for summer.  There were lose threads here and there.<br />I have worn this blouse few times to work and I have received compliments, mostly on the color.  Like I said it is light weighted fabric which works great for summer.
B005R9DOX4|2|I bought the royal blue gloves and the white gloves. The blue were a beautiful Satin but when the white gloves came they were not satin and also one of the white gloves had a stain on it.
B0066SJPD8|5|Love the hat!  Just had a brain tumor removed and this helps make me feel good hiding my shaved head!
B00LAWJDQO|5|He loves it so much that he sometimes has to wear it all day long!!
B00N1QHVF2|5|I love this bra. My bust tends to spill out under my arms in other bras but this one has full coverage. The extender is great for when my back starts hurting i can just adjust it out very easily. I ordered the extra large and my pregnant bust is a 40C.
B00O2DJOYY|5|cool yo
B0018OQIEY|5|My sons are slim and athletic and the uber baggy and relaxed cut jeans look ridiculous and feel awkward on them.  This is a great fit for slim guys who don't want the skinny skater jeans
B009PS9Q4Y|5|I got this for the grandson and the great-grandson.  They are very much into Ninjago .  They put them on their back packs.
B00331IOGA|5|I am 6'2&#34; 205lbs, medium build.  i purchased a MEDIUM because I read the reviews before hand and the MEDIUM fits me perfectly.  I even have enough room to layer under it if needed.  I am really glad i didn't buy a large.<br /><br />Nicely built jacket, very comfortable.
B0043BWO0G|3|too small
B00BHA0PB6|4|Fits right on
B000V82NCO|5|I bought the tie for a Shrine Hospital Fund Raiser. I have good complaments on it and other Shriners asked where I got it.
B004Q6KWF2|3|If you have large hands, do not purchase these. They were very small on me. All and all a nice product though.
B00HBJMFG0|5|These are wonderful
B00L0980FM|1|I am 5 ft. tall 123 lbs.  They told me to order an X large. I thought that sounded to big so I ordered a L.  I think unless you are over 6ft. tall with no boobs you will not be able to wear this dress.  It was to big everywhere except the top which is gapping.  I found this dress impossible to wear.This is the 2nd time I have gotten burned, and it will be the last.
B0002TP1D0|3|Socks provide a nice cushion for the bottoms of my feet, and they fit my size 11 4E feet pretty well -- I need a loose sock due to foot problems.  My only wish is that the ankle portion was a couple inches shorter, and also that it did not have &#34;ribs&#34; in it which dent my calf and ankle a bit.  I haven't noticed the bad &#34;linting&#34; issue yet that some other people have mentioned.  All-in-all I will probably buy more in the future.
B00E9CA3KC|5|This is perfect for my needs.  Do not buy it if you're looking for a bra that can support on it's own.  If you're like me you'll need to wear another bra underneath, but this is perfect for layering.  A little on the sheer side, but to be expected for price.  I am a 36C/38B and this fits very comfortably.
B000NZW3IY|5|I rate this shirt at five stars just based on what I have read.  I plan on buying cases of this shirt to pass out in the Emergency Room instead of narcotics and other feeble remedies.  This shirt changes lives, and our clientele will no longer need our services.  No need for universal healthcare now that the three wolf one moon shirt has been discovered.
B00IHVF8N8|5|Excelente producto.!
B00F2VYJG8|5|Colors as shown are close, fabric is a nice weight not thin. Size and fit are good. A very nice product will get more
B004HJP4S8|5|I found what I was looking for longtime.Its fits me very well.
B000WB6UAG|5|The mere fact that I'm writing this review should tell you something about how great this bag is (I never write reviews).     I've had the Fatboy Versipack for about a year now (I purchased mine from Kelly's LE store in Springfield, MO), and I use it for EVERYTHING and I carry it daily. Very durable (1000-Denier water and abrasion resistant light-weight ballistic nylon, Teflon fabric protector, YKK high strength zippers and UTX-Duraflex nylon buckles). Strap is comfortable and adjusts easily, plus the backside of the pack has very nice AS-100 high grade closed-cell foam padding for carry comfort. My coworkers call it my \\"man purse.\\"     On any one day, you'll find the following items in my Fatboy:  *. Wallet (and the wife's on occasion!)  *. Cell phone  *. Pens/small writing tablet  *. Keys  *. Garmin GPS 60cX unit  *. Pocket knife  *. Ruger P95 9mm semi automatic pistol  *. Spare magazine for the P95  *. Small sewing kit  *. Package or two of gum  *. Mini Mag flashlight  *. Other assorted items as needed    WONDERFUL bag. I highly recommend it. If you plan on using your Fatboy to carry a concealed weapon, I recommend the velcro CCW holster  by Maxpedition for a VERY secure hold (which can be found here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZT8BS/ref=cm_cmu_up_thanks_hdr)     Mike in Columbia
B0009MDOEI|2|The fabric is very soft & comfy, but too stretchy and hence I shouldn't have bought the 36, as I do w/regular bras.....I should have bought the 34. Expensive to not be able to wear it & not returnable! :-(
B004VOD56M|4|Our fair skinned girl hates hats.  If you've got one that immediately pulls her hat off, this works as good as any we've tried.  The brim is a little floppy, so sometimes it does droop down into her eyes, but it is very wide, and offers lots of protection.  Overall its the best we've found, I would recommend it.
B00K3IG4Y0|2|Cute, but way small
B005MZZ594|4|I do not rate 5 stars because the saving was not as described, however the product is good, fits correctly and I am hapy with it.
B007NG6O7C|5|Love this. Plenty of stretch, looks stylish. I removed the little tassles, still looks wonderful. I wear over some solid dresses that just need something extra, this does the trick!
B00H8ZJWBI|5|Bad ass hoodie!
B00BFX4MOG|5|Have been looking for something like this product for quite awhile now; it is just exactly what I have needed.
B00IMVYLEA|3|The description didn't say these were leggings. Sent them back, wanted skinny jeans.
B00HDF575I|5|The tie was good quality but it was super skinny. Too skinny for my taste. This has nothing to do with the tie.
B00M23QQGA|5|Sized right, priced right.  And it has held up through many washings.
B007TBJ9J6|5|I am not a big online shopper but had to have these. All the other reviews had me split down the middle on what size to pick. I followed the sizing guide and everything is perfect. I am thinking that some consumers might be a little naive when it comes to their &#34;actual&#34; size. Great buy, highly recommend!
B007VLS4JA|1|These jeans fit more like skinny jeans. I have an old pair of 559's and the fit and quality of the jeans is completely different. I don't know if Levi's is trying to save money by using less material or what, but these new jeans are horrible. They are pretty tight in the legs and on your boys. I'm going to try and order a pair of 569's to see if they fit like the old 559's, but based off the current reviews I'm not very hopeful.
B009YKTSA0|1|I purchased this about 2 weeks ago and out of 4 hair ties 2 were broken.<br />Over all i bought 7 pacs of different assorted Hair ties and out of them considering all the broken pins, over all i got 2 packs in good shape with shipping it costed about $12 ( the website says $3 shipping but at the checkout there is only 1 shipping option which is $5.00.<br /><br /> The Return Policy states as below:<br /> if you are dissatisfied for any reason , simply return it to us within 30 days for a refund. Please Choose carefully, as we are unable to refund shipping costs. We cannot accept items that have been worn or washed. and please place a new order for additional items......<br />In the end when i did the math I paid $12 for 2 packs of pins which are total of 7 hair ties, JUST NOT WORTH THE PRICE. when contacted amazon and further they contacted the seller they told i will get refunds for product and not shipping and then when i re-order i still have to pay shipping? it was overall not worth the price i rather let $12 go into drain.
B0037NZ3HM|5|these are so cute and adorable and the toddler just loves them!  very pretty and they wash well too, keep shape
B00G3N7MLI|4|It looks just like the picture. The arms are sewn a little narrow. Arrived quickly.
B00ADA6CJU|5|great price. this is a bra, not the panties shown in pic
B00B0ZNMM2|5|Very pleased.  I like it and it fits well.  Am a 36 bust.  Shirt is not tight nor is baggy. Just right.
B00553XOGO|5|A really comfortable bra!
B0006V1JE4|5|very cute bag. great when you just want something small to put your keys, make-up when you go out in the evening. one thing though there are no beads on the other side of the bag otherwise very nice, zipper works well.
B002EDS1HA|5|I used this as the lion for &#34;The Wizard of Oz;&#34; I topped it off with a badge of courage that I also ordered from Amazon. This route was cheaper than buying the authorized lion costume. Feels durable, not cheap like a Halloween costume.
B004O93S0C|3|I guess the fit on these shoes it hard to tell because they are &#34;slip-on&#34; rather than having some zip or Velcro option.  That means that although they fit relatively well they are hard to pull on and we always struggle a bit-making them feel small.  I've used other brands that open wider to get on and then Velcro closed which makes it easier.  Once on they work well and are super light but with good bottom grip, so I've bought them twice (as my son has grown), but would love to see some modifications so that he can eventually put them on himself.
B00JRUP9BE|1|This dress is cute but the pattern is made from plastic and is already falling apart.<br /><br />It would be so cute if it was made better.<br /><br />Shame.
B00JAC1V2U|1|No support, even with underwire, not much lift on these, even when adjusting the straps.
B00BFQ3JMY|5|Bought these at Kohl's initially, like the fit, went back for more and in typical Kohl's fashion they didn't have anymore so I went to Amazon. If you find yourself squatting or kneeling or just moving around a lot in general while wearing jeans, these are great, they have a bit of nylon or spandex woven into the denim so pants give you a wider range of motion than most jeans. Super comfortable and not too bad to wear in hot weather either.
B00LU6WQK0|4|It does look good. Cheap quality. But it's fine.
B00EZIQLQU|3|Because my legs are kind of fat, the fabric texture rubs together and appears to be coming apart. I didn't expect it to fit as good as it does, however... Because it is a one piece it kind of drops down a bit and can be a bit hard to put on. Other than that and the fabric style the cosplay is wonderful!
B001HQO200|5|My boyfriend love these hats.
B00A7QUCAU|5|my fiancé LOVES
B00EGGLQ2A|1|The suit was way to much of a hastle and I'm a small girl and it was ripped on the side before I even put it on
B00B9LML3I|4|I bought these pants for my husband.The pants fit nicely however the hem is small so when I adjust it for length the hem might be tiny.
B00B5HJMW4|5|I have bought several dresses from this company and happy with each and everyone of them a little see-through so put a pair of  shorts underneath perfect go for Summer day
B00IGVB266|1|I dont usually write any reviews but because i was so excited to start waist training..here it goes! Ok, first unless you have a really long torso it wont fit, this goes up over my breasts area and of course that means i cant tighten it. Therefore the bottom half if tighten will be unpropotioned so now i have to buy another one to begin this journey..
B00L26ZDNA|1|I WAITED 6 WKS OR SO FOR THIS TO COME. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK! I HAVE SHORT ARMS BUT SLEEVES ARE VERY SHORT WHICH WOULD BE FINE. THE FRONT OF SWEATER IS SO SHORT MY STOMACH IS SHOWING, AND I HAVE A SHORT TORSO. IT I GARBAGE WON'T EVEN WEAR ONCE, AND IT COMES FROM CHINA SO I QUESS I'M STUCK WITH IT
B00P0NEIOG|5|Works great
B00NAJZA62|2|Symbol/ logo was destroyed by one wash in the laundry machine.
B006S6SB8I|4|Had to order this for a 4th grade student (can you believe it?) I used in a school drama.  He loved it and so did the audience.  Quality material...would have given it a 5 star except for the price tag of $60.
B0007YXTT8|5|I have been ordering and trying for months. I wanted wire-free but with strong side support. And, of course, I want it to feel good. Well, voila, who would have ever thought I would not have to pay $60 to get what I wanted? Ladies, it is wonderful, and I am a DD. I'm ordering more!
B00DNFQZVC|3|The Colors on my daughter look a little odd.  Seems like this romper is more suited for boys.  My husband refuses to let my daughter wear it.  It is a bit tight in the legs/thighs.  I recommend if your baby is a tad chunky in the hips, not to get this, it will not fit.  However, in the several times I washed this romper, it has not shrunk.  It is made well and is durable.  Great for playing outside or just any dirty activity.
B00CFR2INS|5|awesome hat i have it in black brown and soon to be grey. if you are a 62cm it will fit you like a glove
B003ELQMG8|3|The picture of the walnut belt on the product page shows a dark brown belt.  The belt that I received is a very light brown.  It is not what I expected, and not what I wanted.  After reviewing the product page afterwards, I think that the picture of the walnut belt is the same as the picture of the brown belt.<br /><br />It seems to be a good quality belt, but I don't think it is worth $98.
B00XVB7GH0|3|No snaps on the bottom, so you have to take the entire outfit off the change a diaper. But very cute
B00EPYBMLS|5|Its the favorite jacket so far.
B003JL7BIG|2|Really a bad hat.  The hat is not as pictured. The santa stocking part sticks straight up because the are too short.  Hate it
B00KIZF0IY|2|Way too wide. Probably to be expected for 1-size fits all. I'm 5'2&#34; and petite, and the shirt is so wide, I'll have to take 2in in at each side.
B00STV31LM|5|Perfect :)
B000FGVWLU|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE this hat!  I would order 10 more in different colors.
B008KCK0FK|5|High quality; ............very nice
B00ID4RGDO|5|I suspect there is a problem to be asked above question<br />Personaly they  won't be to large as long as i don't have the tight binding
B00LX5KUQA|3|I am typically a size 8, but with the other comment on here, I bought a size 10, because I am a larger up top than most size 8 women.  While the rest of the dress fit pretty well, if not a little big, I could not get the side zipped up over the top.  If you are a smaller person up top, I think that the dress would look really nice.  I have to return it, unfortunately.
B0089JCL2O|3|I bought it way to big for me
B0077F6GZO|5|I love these panties!  They have what I call &#34;sexy coverage&#34;...not so little to be uncomfortable, but just enough to be smooth under close fitting clothing without creating those annoying little bulges.  I'm disappointed that Wacoal has discontinued this style.  They make a great prooduct, so I'm hoping to find a replacement style that I will be as pleased with.
B007AISF7K|1|I was really disappointed when I opened this and saw that there is a big yellow patch where the eyes are. This isn't a huge deal but it is clearly not there in the picture. Other than that and being pretty uncomfortable it seems alright but still not great quality.
B00AW5PB34|4|Well when I opended the packged I thought was really small, but wasnt....good suprise !!! Worth it. I recomend it.
B00CKXEM18|5|Very cool looking. If you remember that Lucky Strikes cigarettes used to come in packages that looked like this, you will not be disappointed.
B00BRDCWT6|4|no complaints
B003BVJ3PS|2|I thought I was suppose to get the whole outfit with the stockings and I didn't get them I was very disappointed.
B00O5G537K|5|Brilliant! I think they make me look a bit clever! Bought these and had my prescription lenses put in and wear them every day. I get lots of compliments on them, which I didn't expect. Someone even approached me and said &#34;good afternoon, Doctor!&#34; That made my week.
B00TJ09XUA|1|I hate these tank tops!  What a waste of money.  They were great right out of the package but after I washed them in cold water and hung them to dry, they were stretched way out of shape.  So I decided to try drying them and they shrunk.  I cant even wear them anymore.  I wish I had my $30 back.
B00JMPZD1U|5|Great shirt! I got a medium & it fits true to size.
B00M0JN2AY|1|Doesn't look like this sweater at all
B00188PIGO|5|I am very particular about my underware and this is the first time purchasing online. I was not dissapointed.  Very nice, holds up well with washing and no fading on the band when cloroxed.
B007G4LBKQ|4|Material is thin but workable. Love the look. Very comfortable. Fits well.
B00NNFHF3O|5|Nice
B00DOPKWQU|5|Nice fit
B004A7XY84|5|This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.
B004HYGO2I|5|Hi Amazon,<br /><br />This product is excelent! It's very cool! The recommend at to all customers!<br /><br />Saludos,<br /><br />Luis Guglietta
B000WJHEVW|5|I purchased these to use in a \\"nerd\\" photo session and they were super cute and worked just like I needed them to
B002RZVTNI|1|I was really excited for these to arrive... read a lot of positive reviews so I decided to purchase, not to mention I was eager to find a pair of these - and was unsuccessful in every store I looked.<br /><br />Basically, save your time and money... if you are looking for that &#34;leather legging&#34; type of look that has been popular this past year. The leggings were extremely baggy (I am 5'5 130 lbs, ordered a medium). They sagged in all the wrong places... looked more like MC Hammer pants.<br /><br />Shiny, flimsy material; so much so, that I was afraid to pull them up for fear of breaking them!<br /><br />Happy to return, and officially end my quest for the perfect pair of leather-like leggings.
B00LKY07LM|2|Pants were perfrect--top the sleeves were too tight.  Returned.
B00BCUP9TE|1|Too big<br />I need petite 6
B00BGH2V4O|4|The costume is very cute and a decent value for the price (comes with everything you need to be a pirate except boots and jewelry). I purchased a 3X and it barely fit my chest, even though I wear a much smaller top normally than a size 3X (mens XL t-shirt, for example).
B001UHMZI2|5|I bought this for my husband and fits him perfectly. The price is bargain because the original price is twice expensive. This is his second pair.
B00IQG87AU|5|Very, very nice. I received a size M (I'm 5'2 & 130 pounds) it fits amazing and hugs my curves perfectly. It can be a bit confusing at first sight but isn't difficult to figure out. I've recieved a lot of compliments on this already!!! :) Would recommend.
B00606NDJS|4|This is just what we wanted.  Zipper pocket for phone etc.  The only problem was that it became shorter when washed.
B006K9YBY6|5|First time I've ever ordered clothes online and this was great.
B00KNN418Q|5|Can't wait to see this on my granddaughter!
B0092KFWB6|3|I bought 5 XXL  t shirts and this XXT fits too snug. I don't know why it does but it seems the material may be different. It's also way too tall for me… Im a big guy too. Just go for the XXL and you'll be fine.
B007FZS9C4|4|I bought it as a gift.Generally good idea and product .Based on other reviews suggestions I got too big size.
B0052TASI8|5|I wear these tights for a costume and just love them. So comfortable and they fit great. I'm very pale and the light toast color works great to make my legs look tanned yet not too dark from my natural skin tone. I love these tights so much, I've bought multiple of them!
B0061SI138|5|I bought this buckle as a gift for a fellow Bones fan. The buckle is of a very good quality - bright colored enamel, clean, and well built. There wasn't any damage when I received it, and it wasn't \\"cheap\\" feeling (lightweight plastic, rough edges, etc.) like reproduction or imitation products can be. It has held up over the past year without any visible wear or damage, with almost daily use. I assume this is a reproduction of the show's buckle as there are so many and I've no idea what the brand of the show's original buckle is, but frankly this is just a good buckle, regardless of any \\"licensing.\\"
B00YI4T2JO|5|Good quality.
B00BUN59IO|5|This was the perfect pajama- soft but lightweight cotton fabric. I would buy another pair without hesitation. They fit very well .
B0036O75CI|5|Fits very well I would compare this sizes to American Eagle or Guess sizes.  Just an ordinary plain orange shirt.  Nothing to exciting to say about it.
B00LM3CHWI|4|It is a nice skirt, better then what i expected. It came on time and colors are as the picture. Great buy =^ ^=
B009I1PHQY|5|Love it love it love it!
B00DJJMA8E|4|Not a super tight fight, wearing a tank underneath was perfect. Light and airy, very dressy and just what I was looking for!
B007ABX55O|5|Cutest lil costume! My 16 month son looks adorable! I would say fits true to size based on the size clothing your child wears and not age. Purchased 18mo to 2t and fits perfect.
B0057Z0DOG|1|If you're a chesty supermodel, you may look good in this swimsuit. Otherwise it is a disaster! The fit is NOT true to size, and both the bottom and top gap in weird places. It is definitely not made for swimming or sunbathing, because if you are not posed exactly as shown, you find yourself showing way more skin than you intended. VERY disappointing!
B00NAG686Q|5|Great coat great price.
B00FSKB8VM|3|But, it's okay. Definitely a summer piece. Feminine and would buy again. Was hoping for winter..but no. Victorian flavor I'd say!
B00GY5KQS6|5|VERY PLEASED AND HAPPY WITH MY NEW WATCH
B007P88GGA|2|the arms were too tight
B00CJYKX0W|4|My son loves this onesie.  My only complaint is that they didn't have additional colors in my son's size.  Maybe they will become available at a later date.
B00382E6SO|4|My son loved them and they fit ok. I just thought the legs were a little tight.
B00IFQV8UM|5|I wear a 6 1/2 Sperry shoe and the socks fit great.  I got them to wear with my Sperry shoes. The socks have comfortable seams and a small gel cushion on the back of the heel.  Exactly what I wanted.  You can see a little peak of the sock in the front sides,  but I don't mind it.
B0031U0PA6|5|Materials are pretty high quality. I am pretty hard on my belts so was nervous about buying before I saw the materials. I was impressed with the quality of the belt.
B0047T4Q1E|4|The fit, the color choices are perfect.  It was for a costume for my daughter.  The fabric is a little thin, but overall it was just right.
B001S21JWW|5|Exelente
B00MZ7EL1K|2|Fabric rough, all the buttons fell off when I washed it.....on delicate in cold water and one seam is not stitched correctly.  I will have to re-stitch it.
B00JOS96HM|4|good
B007Q3K9S2|5|I bought this set for my Mom for Christmas.  She had previously stated to me that she had been wanting some pajamas with a drawstring waist (for tummy comfort). a v-neck, short sleeves, as well as something that wouldn't bunch up and prevent her from turning when she was sleeping.  It took me awhile to find all of her requirements and these absolutely work for her!  They're very soft and look great even when simply walking about the house.  I'll definitely be buying her more.
B00HNJTQU6|5|I was hesitant to buy any type of waist cincher for fear it would be uncomfortable, but this garment put those reservations to rest.  It is so soft, thin and comfortable and provides just the right firmness to give the desired definition of a more shapely waistline.  Virtually undectable even under lightweight garments.  I love it!
B0064YQAB4|4|I bought this for my teenager son who never worse it, so it became mine immediately.  My son likes Cartman, but I think he is afraid to wear it because of haters.<br />So, I'm a 50 yr old lady and not too  much worried about what other people think.  The only draw back to the shirt is, anything black seems to always attract lint.
B000MXB6EO|5|I have been wearing these for years, they hold up well through washing after washing and keep their shape.  Very comfortable and do not ride up!
B00T8NMYZY|3|You should go a size up if you have a wide foot.
B006PGGJOE|5|It is really what i was looking for .. Good matrial and meet my needs to keep my licanse and my bank's card safe ! Its awesome wallet
B00H4FFRTI|4|Very comfortable
B000MTFGMQ|5|I bought these for my 8 yr old granddaughter to wear to a theme brithday party.  The fit was just right.  The look was perfect.  The best part was her smile when I took them out the box.
B008ZTZG1Q|2|Depressing, sadly. The image they show is a hat with a green brim under it, sadly, it's all black. Disappointing. At least take a new picture of the new with the all black brim because I wanted green. It didn't even have a sticker on it.
B001IV0MGM|5|It's really hard to find a nice slip like this in the stores anymore.  I like the fact that I could shorten the slip without too much problems.
B00U8UYXXW|2|kind of slide down when I walk,they look good but need more spandex,had to hike them up all the time!they would be great otherwise,into the donate pile
B0043XG5M2|5|good material. fits and looks great.  size 32-34 in jeans and very cool buckle (thats it, just need more words)
B00BCN90N2|5|bought it it as a gift for my fiance and he is a huge bleach fan. he is in love with it
B00O0HVV4I|2|Inexpensive .
B00MVK6SVC|5|Love it!!!!!
B00G3U4EDA|5|I've had these shorts for about 6 months, still love them!
B0049W4MDQ|5|Since this was a juniors size, definitely order a size or two up. I normally wear small or extra small, but went with a medium just to be safe. The design is well-made and exactly as pictured!
B008MAZV2M|2|These sunglasses look cool but didn't work for us.  There is no air circulation around the eyes due to the foam barrier so the glasses would fog up constantly making seeing difficult, especially in hot weather.  The strap function is a great idea though because my son has a larger sized head and this adjusted well to it.  I'm bummed that they didn't work.
B005DHWBJI|5|Son-in-law loves it...thank you!
B009E37G7Y|5|Love these union suits! Material is thick and snaps are good quality! The color is consistent with pictures on product pages!
B00UTR8S4Y|5|Amazingly lightweight and nice looking.
B007V9OAXG|4|A quality material and looked great, but the sizing was off. The 2X shirt was more like a large and didn't fit my dad. But price was great and shipping was fast.
B00474KHHG|5|I received my Faux Fur head wrap last week and it come in just in time for the crazy cold weather we were having in Houston.  I was really surprised in how quickly it was shipped, plus I received so many compliments in it.  Thank you and I would really recommend the company.
B0007CKNHG|5|The quality of wrangler jeans is certainly high. Well made; good lines and stitching.<br />The only issue to contend with is know your waste size vs. how wranglers fit. In this instance there is plenty of room in the rear, the thigh and boot region.<br />These jeans were simply way too big, even for a husky one like myself.<br />Still,  Wrangler is a good, solid brand and a good choice all around.
B003ICBD3U|5|Wear every year at the two rivers renaissance faire where I am the mayor
B001F6VANE|5|Good material and a good color, it looks just like the picture and I am well pleased with the necktie.
B005GYGEXW|5|Great light cotton capris... Good quality, nice color, exact to fit... Great for daily workout ... Would definitely recommend it
B00BB7O110|3|Loved the dress but the sizing was off. Returned and ordered a larger size but there was no difference. Maker needs to implement better and more uniform sizing standards. Very is disappointed.
B006PDNIPK|5|Not the most fashionable suit but I wanted it for tubing on the lake and it was great.  I have large breast and this suit fit like a glove.  Was great for all the lake activities without worrying about your suit falling off
B00T4ITU0U|4|They are very comfortable. I ordered the 2XL being a big guy, they are a little smaller than the same size in Hanes or Under Armor. The legs ride up as well. I wish they were available with a longer leg option. I would buy them again.
B003NX8D8W|4|The receiver loves it wears it as much as she can!
B00XJU8P3C|4|The suit looks exactly like the picture, and it's really cute on. I bought a large, and it's actually a little too big around my ribs. But the bottoms fit perfectly. All in all a good buy.
B00F7MMMWU|3|I love this dress, it fit well and is very comfortable but the craftsmanship is terrible.  The first time I wore it, two of the decorative buttons fell off and the bow also fell off.  However, I like the dress so much, I took it to a tailor and had them reinforce all the buttons and bow.
B008F4HS1W|5|Lightweight and fitted! I love it.
B00CLIUXMY|4|This corset is really well made and high quality, especially for the price.  I used it for a poison Ivy costume and I removed the black bows and glued ivy leaves to the front.  I took off one star because it runs really really small.  I'm a C cup and I usually wear a size small in most things but I ordered a medium based on the other reviews.  It was still pretty tough to close.  I had to loosen the laces quite a bit.  If you have any boobs at all, you should size up 2 sizes.
B00KG38030|5|Love them! Best pair of jeans I have ever purchased!!! for the price. Long enough AND perfect in waist and thighs!
B000KILNT4|5|This is a great, basic leotard.  As long as you follow the sizing chart, the fit is right on!  The leotard also keeps its shape nicely after washing in cold.
B004OKAZVQ|4|BUT IT WAS MADE IN MEXICO
B00FJ5LI3O|5|I'd been looking for an over-sized card holder for several weeks.  This one is great.  Slightly larger cards (ie. medicare) fit well.  Also, it's good for wallet sized pictures.  Great buy..
B00LUL3NFW|4|Cozy, except for the small pesky tag that needs to be removed or it will irritate your neck.
B00Q6U0ZDK|4|Thin so I need to wear a tank under it but I love the fabric.  The fit is comfortable and flattering.
B00F29Y5UA|5|Received this scarf as a gift & though I wasn't a big fan of animal print before this has definitely swayed me! The colors are rich & vibrant & the material is super soft. The scarf is very well made & is lightweight enough that it can be worn year round. I've worn it several times & each time have received so many compliments!
B00H4UQO0E|3|Everything about this shirt is loose and flowy, except the very end of the arm holes. Nothing like having pudgy, pregnant arms paunching out at the seems.
B00D2LGP2Q|4|The material on this is nice and soft on this garment. It's just perfect for sleeping or lounging around in.
B003F6RLL2|1|The size must actually be a 6. I'm a size 8 and both the pants and shirt are too small. It is really cute,  but will mot fit if you are bigger than size 6.
B00BAXL72G|4|Got my romper faster than expected! More than what I was hoping for, it's a very pretty ivory-great for my twins photo shoot!
B00GXJ6LXC|3|These capri's are really great. I wanted these so bad I ordered the XS because they were out of the small. They are a little tight. But I am glad i got them
B00Q4NK36S|1|Sooo small
B001R4C9YI|5|I buy these every year for my daughter for school.  She hates the seam in the toe of the sock and will stop wearing socks and end up with stinky smelly shoes and feet because of it.  So I started buying these seamless toe socks and she loves them.  Spoiled rotton thing!! But hey no more stinky feet!! She wears a 61/2 in Womans in US size and I bought the 9-11 and they fit perfect ..
B00HT3R7SO|5|Awesome
B0058LTWIW|1|Very beutiful,recieved on time..but,When i tried it on two of the eyelets tore through the fabric completely..dont know if it was just me or cheap made.So beware not to cinch it in to much,it will tear.
B00JSMQQW2|5|love it / a bit warm but thought and/or hoped it would be, very fond of G-Star Raw collection, thank you.
B00KLTE77M|1|I order a size bigger and still way too small . I'm 150 and order a xxl disappointed
B00IGJYOZ4|5|These bras are super comfortable and fit really well! Plus I got them 3 days after ordering it!
B0007IQFRC|5|This wallet has plenty of room for credit cards, two money slots (one of which I use for receipts and business cards) and the zipper option for peace of mind.  Easily fits in your pants pocket which is how I have used it.  This is the third one I have purchased.  They typically have lasted me about 3 years and that is with beating them up pretty good.  Only wallet I will ever own.
B00GNYAU7A|5|I love this ! The cashmere is really nice! I want it in every color!
B00LUIHRFM|5|I like the way the feel on my body, very comfy !!!!!!!!
B00873FXVI|5|This shirt is really soft and smooth. Its not suffocating material. It is a great shirt and it is very comfortable.
B001LM45MU|3|Because it is to big will order a smaller size. It does not hold me in good enough but it looks like it does/will work. Most deffinitly reorder.
B005UGTSIE|4|I bought a pair of these for my Mermaid Man costume.  They are indeed for women.  Luckily my Mermaid Man wears underwear over his tights.<br /><br />The costume was a smashing success.
B005HJ8P4C|5|Daaammm this coverall is the best quality and the best price I buy another one for sure thanks seller
B00NU7C7BK|1|Ask for a return label.
B003N63ET2|5|She works out all the time and it was hard to find a boss' day gift, this worked along with a top.  She said her daughter, who she works out with, will probably want to steal them (hopefully not after they're worn - ha ha).  Good deal.
B0050BWXNG|5|I got this hat for my boyfriend I wasn't aspecting much because it's a hat on the Internet but when I opened it I loved it so much it's so perfect thanks so much man :)
B00S4FGTT4|5|My daughter loved!!!!!!
B00655E1FO|5|These are super comfortable. Thin, silky cotton. Lace that isn't scratchy. They don't show too much, so it's okay if overnight guests see me in them, but they're feminine and fitted enough that I don't feel like a slob in front of my hubby.
B00EIBPUQG|5|This outfit is even prettier when I received it than it was in the picture!! Good workmanship in the stitching and the trim work is adorable....This package arrived as I expected just in time fr our family Christmas on Dec. 29th. I am very pleased with my choice of this product, with the fit, and fabric ect.....<br />Thanks Amazon. Keep up the god work.
B00D70XZLQ|3|Cute & great fit.
B000LSRU9K|5|perfect fit and very nice looking...too good for golf,,,wear em for dress pants
B007ZSKSV6|3|Reading other reviews, it seemed like these tanks fit well and the LONG version were too long for people. I'm 5'11&#34;. I found these tanks to be far too short and the long version to fit just right.
B00BA1WWQI|5|I'm back to purchase a second wrap just like this.  I purchased one a year or so ago and love it!  We have an RV and I want one to leave in it.  I like that the wrap is more of a terry robe on the inside and velour on the outside.  I'm 5' 2 1/2&#34;, 155 pounds and it fits perfectly.  If you are any larger than me, you'll probably want to consider an XL.
B00MAVN0R2|4|I've been browsing for a new wallet for some time and I was skeptical about buying a wallet online.  However, I am blown away at what a good purchase I made.  I can fit both my ID's in the fold out flap and can fit all of my other cards in the 12 other slots.  The card slots are a bit tight of a fit but overall, this was a great purchase for myself.  It could also make a great gift.
B00H88S4HS|4|Runs a little bit big, but I am very satisfied with the color and shape.
B00G7OHW7W|5|This was a donated gift for a school XMAS pj drive. easy purchase
B00Y09UT2Q|5|loved it :)
B000R98ICG|5|Cold weather is a real problem for me (perhaps why I live in the south), and my husband loves it.  I'd raise the thermostat about 5 degrees if I could get away with it, but force myself to live in this refrigerator.  These wonderful leg warmers have truly helped me to survive our infrequent cold spells.  As soon as I slip them on, I feel better.  Hand washing is a pain, but not THAT bad, and if that's the price I have to pay, I'm more than happy to do so.  I wear them about a week between washings.  If you get cold where you live, you'll surely appreciate these...
B00CZ7PPEC|5|Baby shower gift. She loved them!
B00E0H6SUA|1|Great coat, super warm, but the zipper is not sturdy enough for a kid. The zipper fell apart in my hands after about 1.5 months of wear. Extremely disappointed.
B00I6FXQPW|4|I love Stance socks and this pair was no different. These are so much more fun than boring old white socks. The quality and durability are also great.
B007W2RCZA|4|Definitely order one size up! I previously purchased a Sakkas Stretch Pencil skirt with the Wide Belt, and the size Small fit me perfectly. However, I first ordered this one in size Small and it was much smaller than the other Sakkas skirt. It was extremely form fitting and tight, where it would be inappropriate to wear to work. I returned it and ordered a Medium, and the Medium was a perfect fit. I ordered the red one. It's a nice red, without being obnoxiously bright. Form fitting, yet not tight so it is suitable for work. It is very stretchy, so it does ride up a little when you are walking because the material clings to your legs. However, it is not too bad of a hassle. I really like it. A great addition for a spring/summer work skirt. For reference, I am 5 ft, about 116 pounds. I usually can fit in to a Small or Medium in junior's sizing, and an XS in women's sizing. The medium size for this skirt fits me perfectly and hits me exactly at my knees.
B001IAR94Q|1|the run small i have to exchange to a 9 i only ware this dickies once and the material is terrible in black it look like i was rolling in the floor that's how much lint it attract so i do not recommend on dark color this was 20$ down the toilet
B0075LUXMM|1|Too small is putting it mildly.  You can't wear this anywhere in public.  It's like wearing a loincloth.  I'd rather just be naked.
B00VQRJIH2|5|Love it!! I'm 7mo pregnant and usually wear a small and this fits perfect.
B00HY5EI70|5|EXCELLENT
B000FEPJF2|5|This hat is amazing. It's been keeping my dome stylish and warm since the instant it showed up. I just hope it lasts me a while.
B00ACIGWJS|5|Thank you for the product works well.
B00CYKP2HA|1|I got a few sets of these onesies for my baby cause they were cute and affordable but after receiving the first set and seeing the poor quality of the items I wanted to cry - ending up reselling all the onesies and buying Carter's
B00TH6Z05I|4|Cute can't wait To try it on..patterns is different but cute and I thought the material was okay
B00328HRGC|5|Thank you for a jean capris that looks polished and doesn't pinch my middle.
B00H1NLJHC|5|I would probably wear a medium in American sizes. And the XL of these fits perfect.
B00ARDD642|5|Highly recommend to buy it as a gift for newborns.
B00E9WDWGO|4|Bought this as a gift, thinking I won the gift olympics. He loved it except for the white and the fact it's a &#34;left handed&#34; wallet. When it's in the right pocket the chain is a lot shorter than when in the left pocket. Also the chain connects to the inside fold of the wallet instead of the outside, which causes the chain to get in the way of opening it. He's trying to get used the whole chain in the way part, but besides that he loved it, and everyone he shows it to loves it as well.
B00GC08KDG|5|I 💗 it! Perfect fit, fast shipping
B00QNR88PI|5|Perfect fits exactly how it's supposed to! I'm 5'8 with a longer torso I worse a regular corset and it bruised me this one is a lot more comfortable and I the fact that it's steel boned worth the price.
B00BD1M0AI|5|This was a gift, and the person who received it really likes it.  She says it is lightweight but warm, and she likes the appearance of it.
B00RXWC5ME|5|the fit is great and I'm very pleased with the quality. Would buy again from this company.
B00N3TZP46|2|Smaller than expected.  The fit is too tight.
B00JAX2Q5A|5|Wonderful coat, my daughter loves it
B0020MMO4G|4|THE BOTTOMS WERE A LITTTLE BIGGER THAN EXPECTED BUT THATS AN EASY FIX, GREAT WORK PANTS ,FIT GREAT AND VERYCOMFORTABLE.....WILL BUY MORE
B0044FOVXE|3|It's okay
B00K7D0G86|5|We ordered this swimsuit yesterday evening and it already arrived today! My daughter is so happy! It is so pretty and the medium size just fits her perfectly. Definitely order a bigger size. My 13 y.o. daughter is only 4'11&#34; and 75 lbs. It's not loose or tight. The chest padding is removable so we took that out for her since she's still flat on the chest. I definitely will reorder from this seller.
B0002M5A1K|5|Good communication and super-fast shipping! Item arrived exactly as described (I am actually wearing them right now...). I have never had a better online purchasing experience. Thanks a million!
B00FHPKAQ2|5|I received a pair of these pants for Christmas from my youngest sister and I love them! They are light weight and very comfortable, perfect for curling up on the couch while watching your favorite Trek (or any other) movie. They are also very comfortable to sleep in.
B000F76PMK|5|Excellent.  It  feel natural and not big.  Really good product.
B00TXN9LXW|5|Fit really nice! The review pic definitely helped me, so that's why am going to post one. I got my regular size btw!
B00ESCKHFY|4|Cute but too small!
B00H3VIK92|1|i had three pair I wanted to order in my cart, since they were very expensive I decided to read the reviews first. I am so grateful of the results, seriously 3 pair if jeans for over $240 bucks, Indeed one has to inquire more. I currently am 5'6, and 185 lbs, I have a great butt already I figured these would take the cake on a day out, what crushed dreams I had after reading the results. I just didnt order. I agree a new tailoring company would be great. Also if they are selling world wide it might be a good idea to inquire about different sizes in certain states.I didn't order but i had to pick a topic and star rating in order to submit my opinion. I upset because I love the look & could picture my self in them, not now!
B002A9JX5M|5|Great pants, arrived in two days. Really nice fabric, will buy more in the future. Great price too, just like shopping at Marshalls, only you get exactly what you want.
B000S6M716|5|I bought these jeans for my son who is tall and thin.  These jeans fit him well and look nice on him.
B00H9WI7T8|5|My little girl loves it and it fits her great! It was the only pink shirt we could find! Very happy !
B005CSNWKK|5|I own 2 of these and plan to order a third one. They are very comfortable, fit perfect & look great!
B001FQPBNO|3|Was a gift for my husband. The item came REALLY quick for which I was pleased. It just didn't hold up well when it was washed, it shrunk a little and just looks old when it isn't. He can still wear it but it got to be shorter, I might suggest ordering a larger size.
B002WTC6CW|5|I bought a four pack for my 11 year old and another 4 pack for another adult male - they both Loved them!  the cushion and arch support are Great - per both of them - will definately buy more!
B00KE2IIT4|3|The hat and glasses (no lenses) worked well as a Halloween costume. The beard was a bit of a joke; just grow your own and you'll be fine!
B00HI611WU|5|amazing hat, great price
B005LPT8Q6|3|Belt rubs color off on pants and leaves big stain marks. But other wise it is very good.
B000J4LFXS|5|The colors are vibrant, the metal is durable. They're just the right size - not too large, not too small. The chains seemed sturdy so I doubt they will snap unless you're really rough with them. They are a little heavy for keyrings, but I feel that lends more to being durable than a nuisance.
B00ACIFZ50|3|I wear these tshirts nearly every day as an undershirt. They fit well but aren't meant to last more than four months.
B007C2PVVW|5|Onesies are nice. I brought these for the long sleeves since it gets a little cold at night in the house. The cloth is breathable, maybe a little on the thin side, but the product met my expectations. No complaints.
B008GOVIEY|5|Cute, comfortable and is very fun. It is a good value and would suggest to anyone adding to their collection.
B00M87W70E|4|A little long on my small frame.  I'm 5'3&#34;, 112lbs, usually wear a size 1 and the small fit perfectly except the length.  Love the high waist- fits well above my belly button! If these were a bit shorter I'd give 5 stars,  but they also fit so snug I can't possibly wear regular undies without blatantly showing lines.
B00OA53IEG|3|Cute but runs small...my boys couldn't wear it.
B00FNT3U1E|4|I looked Groovy Baby!!
B00LR3CEQ2|5|I have been using Hair and Body Pomade for about two months and the result is phenomenal. My hair used to fall out at a constant rate which made it hard for it to grow. Since I've been using this product, I have found that my hair has grown stronger and has been growing. I am happy to have used this product and plan to keep on using it.<br /><br />-GB, FL
B00Z57XK0U|3|Shipping took forever and this shirt runs really small.
B002PJ3T3O|5|I got this as a gift and I don't regret it.<br />this a a good, professional looking clip that isent to plain and is not overdone either.<br />i also really liked the box it came in, it was a major bonus!!
B000YRU2DE|5|This product fit as it says,good quality cotton would recommend this product to all men who wears briefs instead of boxer
B00CHRTBIG|4|This top has a tiny plastic ring where each front strap meets the camisole....and it's SHARP!!!!!! OUCH!!!
B002NLF1CG|3|I was disapointed in these jeans because they are advertised as skinny's and are not...I should have looked at the picture more closely and I would have realized it...I will keep the jeans because they will be fine for everyday wear, just not what I was looking for, for date night with my hubby
B0027E2474|4|The holder arrived quickly, however it was a little bent in the package.  I was able to bend it back into shape.  It was in-expensive and usable.
B000MR6KG4|3|I did not send this back but I probably should have. The straps seem very short and not much adjustment. Not as comfortable as other Champion sports bras I have purchased. Maybe this issue has been resolved by now.
B005HJ7NTK|4|Great socks! more material than most I've tried, which helps fit the calves.  I love the stripes and the color is perfect!
B0018OS4I2|2|the pattern of the mei tai looked nice per picture.  upon arrival, the design was created with decals (i had expected fabric with the design woven into it.)  the material itself is a heavy canvas, making the mei tai bulky to pack in a bag and stiff to wear.  i would choose another brand if i had to do it all over again.
B00D7UXYYE|5|I had used the same leather tri-fold wallet for the last 33 years after getting it for Christmas when I was 12 (Rolfs brand)!!<br />Decided to get rid of the fat Costanza thing and go for something slim.<br />Right now this is what I have in it and functions perfectly fine:<br />Driver's license in one slot, 4 business cards in one slot, Bank card in one slot, two insurance cards in a slot, 6 paper money bills folded in half in the middle slot.<br />It's difficult to slide the cards out with your thumb (which is a good thing) but if you grab what you want with a finger and thumb it's easy to take things out.<br />Only thing I had to get used to was the feeling that I had forgotten my wallet and doing the quick pocket slap all around to locate it!!<br />Still fits easily into a front pocket of my jeans if I want to carry it that way.<br />Very happy with the purchase.
B00M9WD8LK|5|Great great suit will look good on everyone makes you feel like a million dollars
B003CU4DM6|2|It lays flat and feels pretty cheap. Not the worst costume in the world.  Glad I didn't spend too much money on it
B0031U0QC8|5|This was an excellent buy for my physique and they hold up my pants without bunching them up.  I just love them.
B00QDBSGHO|5|Loved it!!!
B00IXNKNLW|5|Excellent
B008DGG5CU|5|Nice!
B005WSZ398|4|The quality is good but it was way too small for my 12 year old petite girl. I was surprised at how much smaller it was. I called the company to return it. THEY HAVE AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!
B00PLCLXJ4|5|Well made and really cute!!! Love it!!!
B0012M49TS|1|This can't be a real Bali!  Compared to the same brand and size I bought in stores, it's 5&#34; smaller.
B00B5WR4EW|5|this are really cute socks.  Comes up all the way to the knee and is soft and warm.  I will buy more.
B00L9TKEJI|4|little pricey for a henley but because of discount I purchased, I am 5'9 150lbs athletic and the medium fits perfectly.  Warm and but not too heavy, I would order another but not for that price.
B00OPCTCNK|5|Gift for my daughter. She loves it. Overnight sleeping and girlie parties have become more frequent but my baby never looked happier!!!
B00GYX2MVW|5|Great. Fit was true to size.
B00FRMEHHI|5|Loved these pj's and were super cute on my boys!
B004W75SAO|4|Fantastic shorts ordered another pair there so comfy. quick delivery and the blue ones were only $36 but $85 for shorts is a bit excessive.
B003VQQYLE|4|it is a little large for me.<br />maybe the size for american men is a little larger than me.
B00FAY4M14|5|Awesome hoodie jacket. Fit's just as I hoped it would. I'm a chick so just use the Men's sizing chart and find what would fit best on you. The whole thing is super soft and fuzzy in the inside and way more comfortable than I had expected. The fabric isn't too heavy or light, it really is a good jacket and uber awesome for it's price.
B00J7MBM36|1|The dress pictured is beautiful. The dress I received is hideous. The neckline is as high as a t-shirt. The sleeves are small and do not have the details that are in the one pictures, and the dress does not have the ruffled look like the one in the picture. The sash is not nearly as long as the one pictured. This looks like an old lady's Sunday dress. Don't waste your time and money on this ugly, cheap rag.
B000KGI9W0|5|Ok, so I live in Wisconsin and it is currently negative 16 degrees Fahrenheit. This coat definitely does his insulation job. Understand that it cannot be work by itself in extremely cold weather like the one we're experiencing right now in the Midwest, but, if - like me - you like dressing in (a lot of) layers in the cold, than this jacket is for you. I add a tiny down vest underneath, on top of my shirt and sweater and I'm good to go!<br /><br />Definitely a good buy ;)
B00I94LNLE|5|so good ,so wonderful!!
B009T5LWY0|2|The manequine that is wearing the coat looks WAY better than you will with it on. Its a bit itchy when wearing it but I would have kept this one if it fit me. I bought an XL but the arms were way to small.
B002CEQWUE|5|This costume fit fine. I did have to wear a camisole to cover some of the cleavage (for a family style event). I wore white tights also and Mary Jane shoes. I wasn't able to fine the crock staff to go with it, but everyone seemed to recognize me without it.
B004N1H8P2|5|Amazing tshirt. Really good quality and perfect size. If you have a musician friend or boyfriend he would love this.
B000NDFYLE|5|love these, are very warm. well made.. this is a replacement for my older one i had for 8 years.. and i wear that one all the time
B004QS30XQ|4|The pants are sooo soft.  They are very comfortable and sit low on the waist, which adds to comfort wear.  They do shrink so don't cut them off and don't put them in the dryer, but if you do they will stretch out again with an iron.
B00HGMA85M|1|Way too small and took too long to get here..
B00JU5HOIW|4|The fabric is REALLY REALLY thin...but its super cute.. you may need to find a short white slip to go under it. would make a cute summer dress
B00O2EN3AY|4|Comfortable.
B00GOG5XM4|5|This is a really, really well-made wallet, but it isn't exactly slim. I would say it's about as thick as the cheap Dockers wallet it replaced. That's not a negative, but I thought I would mention it in case you're looking for something slim. All of my cards fit nicely--not too snug, not too loose--in the pockets, and the hidden sections are pretty neat. The hidden bill section takes a little getting used to, but I think after the leather has been broken in, it will be easier to open and close the flap. The materials and stitching both appear to be top quality. Even the cardboard sleeve the wallet is packaged in is nice.<br /><br />Buy this wallet if you want a well-made wallet with a little extra character, unless you're looking for something slim.
B00SBIMYQQ|5|like
B00QVWLKBE|5|These have to be some of the cutest socks have seen.  When I was given the opportunity to try these socks the first thing I thought of is my daughter would love these.  She has a red fox sitting on her bed that she sleeps with every night.  When I got them in the mail, I was impressed they ,same in resealable package.  I waited to take them out of the package until she got home from school.  I showed then to her ( she did not know about them) and she screamed with delight.  Coming from a teenager that is high praise. She took her other socks off and put these on.  She loved them.  She liked the ears that ears that stuck up above the sock itself the most.  If you are looking for a cute pair of novelty socks these are the ones you need.  They would be great to buy for a gift.  If you are like me and buy Cristmas presents all year long these would be a great &#34;dirty Santa&#34; gift.
B00CP20BMS|5|Great Product, Fast Shipping, Great Amazoner, A+
B00L03MEOG|4|My measurements are 33&#34; bust (wear 32C) and 38&#34; hips. I am usually a Small in swimsuit tops and a Medium in swimsuit bottoms, which is why I wasn't sure whether I should order a Medium or a Small since the reviews were mixed on whether it was too big or just right. The small was WAY too small for my bottom but fit well in the bust, and the medium was perfect in the bottom and a little too big in the bust. If the top just had optional straps to help secure it, the suit would be perfect! I just use the bottoms with a different top until I get around to sewing it smaller to fit.<br /><br />I got the mint blue color and it is so pretty, looks just like Triangl. The only thing that's wrong with the bottoms is when they get wet the material expands (it is neoprene, after all) and gets a bit too large.<br /><br />All in all: the sizing is weird, but it's a cute suit.
B00D2BYEMO|5|This shirt was one of two I purchased.<br /><br />My husband is a gun enthusiast and this shirt was a Christmas gift.  He was very pleased with it and has already worn it a couple of times.  I got it a little large and he wears a sweatshirt under it for now and then will wear it alone when the weather warms.<br /><br />The fabric is sturdy and the decal appears to be one that will wash and dry well.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.l
B00D503P5Y|4|I bought this dress for the military ball. It's a beautiful dress, but if you're anything shorter than 6 feet or not planning on wearing 6-8 inch heels, prepare to have to shorten the dress. I amd 5.4 and I had to cut at least 5 inches off the hem.<br />Also the dress makes you look a little fatter, but maybe it was just my case.<br />Anyways the dress is gorgeous, elegant, and very well-made. I can't believe I got it for this cheap!!!
B00KIWT3IU|1|It arrived damaged and it looked too small to fit  just by looking at it I knew .
B00KF3C79O|5|These are the best when you have many children, just unzip and change! Baby can sleep and play in these. Wonderful affordable product.
B00JFNXZC8|3|Cute dress but too big for size.
B007BYR3UI|3|Nice material and slim fit...but two buttons fell off during the first wash.  So a great summer casual shirt that seems to have a couple quality control issues.
B00VXWKMAC|5|I really like these pants except they are so very long that I had to have them hemmed.  They are pretty tricky to hem considering the fabric is so slinky. They look really nice on and so comfortable!
B00M99QYOG|5|so funny!  Inside joke with my 15 year old boy....he spends forever in the bathroom.  This was in his stocking and everyone got a kick out of it.
B000GENBXS|2|I loved this bra, but unfortunately the material was too itchy for me to wear it longer than it took to try it on. Super bummed.
B00CEH24F6|4|These briefs are comfortable and kept their size after washing. I will be buying more today. They are a good buy
B00062NHFW|2|Cheap thin material but if that's what your looking for then go for it. Bought them for the name for my husband and we were both disappointed
B007P29IT0|5|Love them!! Feet always hurt after long walks, not with these socks. Will be ordering more.
B00LGRXSFA|3|The fit was really small on me. Looked way to tight on the legs!
B009FG8HJQ|5|Very nice quality and feel.  They fit nice and wash great.  Would highly recommend to friends.  What more can I say....they are socks!
B00BCXNM3G|1|This shirt had to be given to my wife who is 1/3 my size.  There is no reason on earth a shirt labeled XXL should be that small.  None.
B001185WW6|5|recomiendo ampliamente comprar, enviaron la talla correcta, el color correcto, y en el tiempo estimado, muy bueno. El color es exacto al de la muestra en la foto.
B00D8O1Q7G|4|Great item.  Good quality.  My toddler loves it.
B00GTTNDB4|4|Smaller than expected in fit but a nice vibrant color and soft fabric make up for it nice and comfy
B00NG8LH50|5|Love them. They are perfect.
B00IKAXQTE|4|This product fits strangely.  The torso seems very large, but the arms are a tad too short.  I don't think that I'm oddly shaped, as I haven't normally had problems like this.  I'm a big guy, too, so usually my problem is that in order to get the torso/chest to fit the arms are too long..  Having complained about that..  I otherwise love it!
B0083R1PUG|5|it rocks, i carry it every where<br />pros<br />it holds alot<br />coin slot<br />id slot<br />looks cool<br />durable<br />neon<br />velcro does not where out
B00EDQ96H0|5|These socks are seriously awesome. They are made nicely and fit amazingly. I would recommend these socks to any one looking for a really awesome tube sock . They have a nice seam in the toe area so it doesn't irritate my skin when i wear them with my boots which is great. Also I am only 5'2 so they might be a tad on the short side for anyone over around 5'9. They fit my feet and my fiance can wear them comfortably as well . He likes them so much in fact that I see him in them almost everyday so I have to keep ordering more haha.
B005I3ULVC|5|My husband really loves these socks.  It allows him to walk pain free and that was a joy for him.  The immediate relief he felt encouraged him to reorder these socks.  He looks forward to many days of less agony.  I highly recommend anyone to give this a try.
B00IPDFCA2|3|Cute but too small
B005GYGFZY|4|I like these pants a lot, but after reading all the reviews on how small they were, I ordered a medium. I think that for working out they are a bit too big. I normally wear a size 4-6, and for lifting, I should have gone with a small. I think people were ordering these as lounge pants and wanted them larger, otherwise I cannot see how they would be too small.
B00BBMSEDQ|5|Good
B008Q23OP2|5|Excelente quality
B00PJBGSZ6|3|SIZE TOO SMALL BUT LOOK OKAY!
B00FRY5QCQ|5|My favorite and go to top. Very pleased with sweater was worth the super long shipping wait.
B00K59N2UG|4|I got a size larger  than i usually get and it was still somewhat small.
B00H8VWKGG|1|Cheap fabric.
B00A0GVN78|4|The socks are very cute but a little tight around the ankles. Still happy with my purchase and would get more.
B005OBFXBG|5|I bought these to replace a worn pair of pants. This pair is better! I really enjoy the cut and how they're fitted.
B00AKSCTJM|4|I was hesitant to purchase considering the old adage, you get what you pay for, but did anyway.  Pleasant surprise, they were actually nice shorts, just a little large, but again for the price, good buy! (paid $20)
B00CU88L92|3|its a lot cheaper looking than I expected. kinda see though and VERY short. its also really unflattering. I had to buy a belt to buy one of those like thick belts for under the boobs..to make it not so...weird looking on. itll work for like quick day to day errands. I just thought itd be a lot cuter.
B004K9B3C6|5|it was a christmas gift for a friend and she loved it and cried it was awesome  great job keep it up
B005CSNYJE|4|I am taller, so these are high waters on me. Aside from that, the fit is super comfy. No pockets though.
B00JTR08PM|5|Super sexy on my wife
B00T6LOI4I|5|Looks awesome arrived very fast
B00P3U6XN0|2|Sorry never had this product
B002QB0V14|5|It's very good,I like it.
B000RLFXL8|5|Nice deep red, came on time
B00NJ8DWVO|4|I had read reviews before purchasing but I have to say despite some I believe it runs a little small and doesn't have the shape I expects from the pics looked more like a regular tee shirt
B00EII8VZ6|4|My 6yr old daughter was so happy with it! Pink is her favorite color, I was so surprised that it was so soft and comfortable. Washed it and it come out surprisingly well!
B003T9VSIM|3|Um.... in no way, shape or form could this possibly be a DD.  It looked comical when I tried to stick it on.  I will say, though, that it stuck very well and I think it would work well for smaller-chested ladies.  For me, though... no dice. I would call it more like a large B, maybe a C cup that was labeled as DD.
B00860TUR0|2|I didn;t care for the stiff material.  I prefer the softer material with the feel of flannel which I expect for a shirt of this sort.
B00KL4MRWY|5|This is a great fit. I am 5'6&#34; 185lbs, bottom heavy and small on top.  I will just adjust one thing, I will have to wear footless black opaque pantyhose since the fabric is stretched out so much from below the waiste.  Since like I said I'm bottom heavy the fabric looses some of the color and is very very sheer so I will be wearing dark stockings underneath so as to not show too much.  Otherwise it fits beautifully, very sexy.  Can't wait for halloween to wear it.
B0076RQLSU|5|This dress is very slimming on.  Very nice color.
B00EHX1TUG|5|These are like Izod or any other quality maker.  I got medium, and the length and waist fit perfectly.  I've washed them a couple of times, and so far they are just what I needed.  The pockets work right, and the cut is like the picture.  There is a single button in the middle behind the zipper flap (no zipper) and that is typical for sleep pants.
B003HC8SBQ|5|gold toe trouser socks are like ALL gold toe socks.... PERFECT!  wear a long time, wash well & quality unequaled!
B00939U07C|3|Comfy socks! However, overly priced for the quality of the socks in my opinion.
B00WJ17YIE|5|Surprise my husband with this great shirt:) he loves it:) thank u fast delivery...awesome
B007WPNNH8|2|I don't know who reviewed these socks, and said they were big enough for a size 13 foot. these are very tight. uncomfortable tight. they seem to be good quality, but they are not big enough. forget that reviewer that said they fit a size 16. they do not. I can fit into jeans that are three sizes too small too, but why would I want to. why don't they make socks for big feet. I can not find a single quality sock, that actually fits my size 13, 4e foot. I have looked. I have bought. found a pair that fits well, but the elastic top shreds after the first wash. and these seem good, but the size is wrong. just because I can squeeze my foot in, does not mean it fits. I don't want to put my socks on with a shoe horn. why can't you just tell me how big they are. this should not be that hard. yes , I bought them, and they were too tight, and I kept them anyway. I needed socks. my bad. now you think you can sell other people small socks and they will keep them too. well, you are probably right. but I can tell you, I will not buy your socks again. and neither will anyone else that is looking for big socks. why not just make them as big as you say they are? I think that's what erks me the most. make them the right size, and I will buy them forever !  quality product, right size, and the world will beat a path to your door. seems too simple to me. but then I don't make socks.
B00BD2S7GI|5|good quality, very comfortable
B00FRM1E74|5|She loved it ! Got it for my friend for a b day gift! She told me it fit well and she was excited to have it!
B00SC1VFMG|3|The shirt runs short, it's a little thick adn not soft.  It says &#34;boutique quality&#34; in the description, so I expected a much better quality of t-shirt.  It's for a birthday photo, and the number is cute, so it will do the trick.  But the price is wrong for the poor quality.
B000627BZ4|1|I thought from the description of this hat that it was for a child or even an infant.  It was just a regular \\"one size fits all\\" so now I wear it occasionally.  It had been meant for my new granddaughter.
B00AE6TO02|5|I ordered this dress for my company Christmas party, it was a 1920 Old Hollywood theme. The dress fir perfectly, just needed to adjust the straps a bit. It's made well and I was very happy with the dress for this price!
B00DIXMBTY|4|This is another top I ordered for my boyfriend and he likes this one as well. He did note that the back is a little longer than the front. This top would look nice on most if not all skin tones.
B00C5GI7WA|2|I was so excited abiut this purchase. I was looking for a costume for a party in DC. The sizing chart is not correct. I ordered the size suggested and was disaapointed. I had to return it and get another outfit.
B00CVRGDJW|4|I was expecting it to be a lot long but I'll work with it, personal preference.
B00ITNJWJK|1|This was something that looked like it came from the dollar store.  It certainly wasn't from Tumi and certainly was not leather!<br />It was a cheap plastic material and smelled terrible-  Thanks for wasting my time and you guys should be ashamed!
B000VRHJF6|5|These are the cutest socks. We always get comments.  They also stay on really well.
B00FQCULE2|5|Nice swim trunks for a very reasonable price. And the plaid actually matches at all the seams -- which is rare in less expensive clothing items. My husband likes the swim trunks and says they are comfortable.
B0055A118U|2|did not fancy actual item much
B008600AM4|2|Way to small ! Good quality shirt but size is terrible...
B00D06E10G|2|I bought this shirt because I used to love the power rangers. Usually hot topi shirts are awesome but this fit is horrible. I'm skinny dude, so unless your a bit thicker don't waste your money.
B00B9BF42S|5|excellent product, very good response time read recommend the store, the quality of the clothes very good, the response was excellent
B00D3TQU4A|5|I bought this vest as a gift for my husband. He has not yet received it but I expect it will be identical to the one he already owns, which has been very satisfactory. It is comfortable, warm and easily laundered.
B005CSNWAK|5|These are the best and the price is great!
B00GSM2YX0|5|This is the first time I purchased a bra and not have to &#34;get accustomed' to the fit.  There was no tightness, the back support was just right and the shoulders did not scrape or dig into my flesh.  Very nice bra.<br />P.S I wish manufacturers will stop branding bras as &#34;Magic Lift&#34;.  We big girls know that there is no such thing with plus size bras.  Truth in advertising guys!!!
B007OSK21S|3|okay fit
B000QAS2SG|3|This is a made in China product of &#34;Italian Stone Design&#34;. There is nothing Italian about this but the &#34;design&#34;. What do you expect for the price- Versace, Gucci, Armani? Its suitable, especially for the price. Soft leather, but rather thin.
B00K07522O|4|The Jacket is awesome, it fit perfectly and had a look and feel of a more expensive jacket.  It also arrived on time and as expected. It's a really nice jacket for the price.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.
B005P78BY0|5|I recieved this as a gift, I love my bear hat, soft material and warm, still wear it
B001WPLD8K|4|I gave four stars only because the shirt was way too small and when I tried to barely even stretch it the letters all cracked on the shirt. It was a waist of my time and my money.
B0051U16J8|5|Great socks that wear well, and aren't too hot.
B009QZKUQO|5|Bought for baby boy grandchild due soon , just perfect! The best thing is the color,so sweet! Perfect,Perfect,perfect! Cannot wait to wrap him up and cuddle!
B00I3SJLMO|5|Perfect gift for my 10 year old niece. She his tall for her age and these are perfect so they may be a little long on normal sized kids. She loved them.
B00EWBZJXG|3|The quality is very good, but unfortunately the fit around the leg is quite tight. It is odd because I haven't had this issue before, but these are very uncomfortable only because of the size of the leg hole.  The fit elsewhere is perfect.  I would not repurchase.
B001W9032S|5|Very, very wide brimmed and UPF 50. Excellent choice for women that want as much sun protection as possible from a hat.
B00D3DUMCC|2|Too large, didn't fit properly.
B00E9ZWYX8|5|Size was just right.
B00M5P6XZE|5|Bought this jacket for those long summer hikes in the Rockies where one gets caught in the rain off guard. Gave it to my wife as a gift and she truly loved it.  The product seems durable and well fitting.  Construction of the sportswear is very well made including the inner lining and zippers.  I felt this was a great purchase and can't wait to put it to the test in our ever beautiful rocky mountains.
B00JD4BTFO|3|I ordered a size small, and I am 5&#34;2 and 117 pounds.The bathing suit does look almost identical to the picture. But the side enclosure is more on the side of your hip, than near the front as pictured. Which really isn't a problem for me at all. But the bottoms fitting very small was a problem. I had a very hard time getting them on because I was basically squeezing and pulling for the bottoms to fit. This may have been a slight fault on my end because my hips are a little wider than most small girls, if you were able to buy top and bottom separate sizes, it would make things a lot easier. It shipped way earlier than I was expecting, which is a plus. It came in a white package, and inside there was a big plastic zip-lock bag, with the bathing suit stuffed inside. I probably wouldn't buy bathing suits from them again, just because the size I got ran way too small so I don't know what I'm getting will fit correctly, and I don't have the time to send thing's back for a refund. But all in all, if your a small girl with small hips as well, this should fit you just fine, and it really is a cute bathing suit.
B00KH8SZI4|5|MY 7TH YEAR OLD SON LOVE IT.
B00L53G7C6|3|but I need to lose a whole person anyway<br />no chocolate for me
B00D3C18OY|4|I ordered a size Asia XX- Large / US X-Large and It fits like an American Medium (slightly tilting on the Large side). Besides that ( and slightly long sleeves), It is a cardigan of good quality that complements any dressed shirt , tie and pants very well.
B00KGVHE20|1|A hole tore into them the week we got them. Not durable for a little boy.
B005AAZ4J2|5|The materials are really delicate, maintain and protect your baby, colors and designs are what you see. The whole process of delivery was promised.
B007CMEUJQ|5|Looking for a checkbook cover & this one is well made. Color is nice.
B00GN7Y0JG|4|Is ok,,,,
B0013BOMO0|5|Perfect item for the Fullmetal fan in your home. The watch is beautiful, works marvelously, with fast shipping. A+
B00BADYWW8|5|Bought as a gift for a Sherlock fan -- decent quality.
B00ACIG1C6|5|I purchased the Hanes Men's 3-Pack Classics Tagless Tanks for my husband and he loves them!
B005WDP398|5|...But very well made and they have taken daily abuse as I were them so often. A great deal and well made!
B002R5A4OS|3|The 18-24 months were too small for my daughter who although she just turned 2 is still in 18 mos clothes.  I purchased the tights/socks in a smaller size (12-18 mos) for my other granddaughter who is 10 mos and those fit great.  I bought according to the sizing chart.  So my recommendation is to buy one size up.
B00ODYM3BS|5|Was a bit concerned about size/fit, but they are very true to size and fit perfectly!<br />The fabric is thick enough for coverage, but not so thick that it is bulky and hot.Very comfortable and perfect hip rise too.<br />Will be ordering more!
B009HNAQ5A|4|I bought the med. size for my son.  He's 10 yrs. old and on the taller side. He's wearing a 10/12 in pants for boys right now. These are plenty long and the waist allows for adjustment.  He can wear them over his sports pants.  They do bunch up at his boots, but I think that's the snowboard style.  He's very pleased, and I think we might be able to get two winters out of them, I hope.
B00G570M8W|3|Wrist bands are a little snug, especially as I bought the shirt too big on purpose. And they don't stay stretched.
B00JX1PEXA|5|Excellent
B004CO6IZ6|5|These are great winter socks. I wear them to work every day. Good quality & fit, plus they stay up well. I'm 6 ft. tall and they come up just under my knee.
B00MYS6QJK|5|Not too think, not too thin. These are just right!
B000VTI5MA|4|The product was great. I ordered two T-Shirts and there was seemingly no problems with them. One of the shirts had a few defects. overall good service.
B0018FYETY|5|I bought these satin gloves for my wedding night and they are perfect! I loved them and will wear them again and again.
B0016A7S4E|2|Way too short in the crotch and seat.
B00PSP6VDC|5|Bought for my husband. He absolutely loves it. He gets compliments on it all the time.
B0030XJ26W|3|It's not bad for as cheap as it is, which is good since he will only be wearing it once.  Runs small.  My son is just getting into 4T clothing.  I ordered the 4T for him because it was the biggest they had (bride picked the outfit, so I had to at least try it).  The shirt just fit and is very thin - looked much better with a tee shirt underneath.  The waist on the pants were a little too snug, but it was ok for a few hours.The hat is too floppy - we didn't use it.  And the straps needed to be pinned up.
B00HNF1UYA|5|A beautiful tie...very spring like...will be just right for Easter church services!
B00OINKSSY|4|Very sexy and comfy
B00D7T11LS|5|Nice color
B00UJ85SSW|5|great
B006FYL176|5|I'm 5'4&#34; and about 140 lbs. the scrub pants fit and feel great
B00GYD1NRQ|1|Bulky.  The gloves were cheaply made and no feel of cashmere in fabric.
B00GBVSJK0|4|I really like this shirt but is smaller around my waist than my other regular fit dress shirts. Other than that its a good Pinpoint Oxford Shirt.
B003GUGC7Q|5|It's VERY cute (I've included some photos).<br />The outside is good and realistic enough to get mistaken for a real sandwich<br />when I left it on the kitchen table.<br />The fabric seems sturdy and it appears to be sewn well enough,<br />and the zippered closures are secure and good.<br />the fabric is not 'stiff', you would need to put your purse items in it<br />for it to 'fill out'. You can see what I mean in the photos I've uploaded.<br />The magnetic closure is strong enough and this will make a great gift!!<br />Maybe \\"slightly\\" overpriced, but I think it should last fairly long<br />(maybe longer if I add an inner liner for extra support).<br />I still give it 5 stars just for photo realism alone!!
B00HFP7696|2|This is a beautiful tie however it's construction leaves a lot to be desired. When I'm tying it the material bunches up and looks like there is an elastic band making it look ruffeled. I so wanted to like this tie I really like the color. I would not recommend this tie to anyone because it will not last I know it is cheap but I've bought ties that were cheap and expensive and always got really good qualit.
B002M13F7U|5|he loves these pants
B00AZ1YT4M|5|Love that these control the tummy, but aren't TOO constricting.  I can still breathe and they don't roll down.  If you want serious tummy control, you'll probably want to wear control panties under these.
B00OMFFRMA|5|Love it.
B000NDCI0E|5|Loved these wore them throughout my whole pregnancy. Absolutely the best purchase for maternity by far.
B0055VFLVC|4|Basically a molded plastic strip with foam for sweat, and elastic ties in the back.  If I had time to shop around for a few days maybe I would find a better one, but this one worked out fine.  It was reasonably comfortable'ish and helped the costume look a little better.
B006TCJVQM|5|It fit as expected.
B008S9AN98|1|Way smaller than other pants styles both at waist and in the thighs. Would not recommend this pants until they put the &#34;real&#34; or actual size fit.
B00H59VPLC|4|These are great--cute, comfortable, easy to wash and get him in and out of.  He's a big boy, so I always order clothes one size bigger than his real age.  GIven that he always needs big clothes, these ones fit as expected.
B00SAN000Y|3|The dress is very pretty however it's a bit too big and there was a small dirt mark on it.
B008ATLO7G|3|I think these gloves are a good product, but ordered the wrong size. I received a refund because the correct size was unavailable.  Maybe next time....
B005GYKOLA|3|My child had a normal sized head, and this stopped fitting over his head before anything else.  I would estimate that it would fit a child who wears newborn size.
B000P497S2|1|I live in Santa Cruz California, and I actually own one of those, and I won it at the Boardwalk and its only worth a couple bucks and it's not sterling silver and the little blue ball fell out of mine.
B00Q8CRK0M|1|Material cheap .....did not look like the picture at all....
B002GU6970|5|A great thong and I have worn many brands. This thong fits well, is comfortable, breaths well. Anybody who hasn't tried a thong should give Calvin a try.
B003RQ0108|5|nice buckle not to flashy
B004S9NE2A|3|I don't know what's going on, but the rose red is most definitely NOT red.  It is same as the pink in the photo, which I thought was put by mistake because that photo is labeled \\"pink\\".  Disappointed.  The package I got is labeled \\"rose red\\" so I don't know where the mistake lies.  Elastic is a little tight, I'm going to have to replace it with a drawstring.  I have 30\\" waist and 40\\" hips and it just fits me.<br /><br />The top panel is not generous for a tiered skirt, I think it will definitely NOT fit anyone with over 42\\" hips, maybe 43\\" snug.<br /><br />After I remove the elastic and dye it deep red like it SHOULD BE, I'll probably have a nice skirt for the price.
B000EPVN3O|4|Feels really good, high quality.<br />The only reason I put 4 stars is because it is not padded.
B004E6LB3G|2|It's in the product description that the infant set is a 2 piece cabana set, but I assumed this mean the dress with a diaper cover as the second piece. However, it is a little top and little pants not a dress and I don't love it. I suppose this is my fault for misinterpreting, but perhaps they should add a pictue of the 2 piece set so it's more clear? My daughter never wore it.
B00CMHB738|4|My granddaughter likes them.  The only downside is that my choices are sports or pink.  I'd prefer some different choices, but the quality of the product is fine.
B00JAQG2XE|5|liked it, my 5 years old son is tall for his age, so got this item size six a fit just perfect<br /><br />great material and finish
B00AJ31408|1|I sent it back as the material is so very flimsy.  cute idea but not happy with with the product for the price
B00NIHNDG0|5|The nice thing about this coat is that the material it is made of is soft & pliable.  It is lightly lined with soft fabric.  Not the typical &#34;plasticky&#34; feel.  Super comfortable.  Umbrella nicely sized for kids & very pretty.  Would buy this again & again.
B007AITWKO|4|Very cute product, it stenches over time but still wears good.
B00BTPOO70|5|this product is really good in quality, color, size, was delivered on time, i recommend it
B00EUAV348|5|Oh men great
B00816OWZ4|5|Love The Boy Short
B00HSGJJIS|4|pretty :)
B0027VT61O|4|My mom loves it ^^ It doesn't look exactly like the picture, but it's a nice color and 80s-esque.
B0036V5NU2|5|Love this shirt great quality. Graphics are amazing! \M/
B00S62TR5S|4|It's good but the size a little bit small
B00OIGLZXI|5|I LOVED THEM SO MUCH !!!!!
B00PDLE0IO|5|Gift for my niece, she loved them!
B00971XEKQ|2|Actually fit bigger than i expected being that its from china. The material is very cheap and sticks to itself. It rides up on the breasts, and the thong is much smaller than i expected, i cpuld barely get it over my hips. However once i did, it is the most comfortable thong ive ever worn for lingerie.<br /><br />...excuse me. Gstring not thong...
B003IC4RA6|2|It fit my 15 year old nephew perfect, but unfortunately I bought it for me.  This was way too small for me.
B00VOTSA4O|4|For five dollars this was definitely a steal. I got a medium, thinking it'd be small on me - I'm 5&#34;2 and about 120 lbs - but it was actually almost too big because I was able to hook to the third row immediately. Keeps everything in, looks nice. Only issue is how short it is. Luckily I have a shorter torso so it's not too much of a problem for me personally.
B008EIXLW4|5|Couldn't be happier with this purchase. It has a youthful look, reminding me of my days running track and field. I love the way it looks and feels, accentuating everything. One word of warning, since it's an Asian manufacturer, the sizes run small by American standards.
B003UAFFWK|4|I've tried others but these are the most comfortable for my bust size and provide the best support for me.
B011126YJG|2|Very thin. Not for active people.
B008ZTLV2Y|4|Bought as a gift for my mother she likes them
B00CBEHAXS|1|way ugly. waste of money. not what i wanted or see in the picture. Huge in the thighs and an off greenish color. hideous
B007JFDXIA|5|Received these pants promptly and have made them a standard part of my shorts rotation throughout the summer.  The build quality is good and the color is just as expected.  The fit is as I hoped it would be in that it seems to adhere to real-world tape measurements of the waist more than other products might do.  Recommended.
B00DUUN5MC|4|Feel they run a little small.  Glad I purchased big for my two grandsons. Otherwise very nice jackets. Good buy just buy big.
B00A3U74O2|5|Scarf is soft and good looking. Colours are calm, and they not such bright as on photo here.<br />Of course this is no cashmere, but prices are also quite different...<br />And this is comfortable for winter.
B00AKG5DQA|5|While it was a junior XL it fit perfect
B000LJN0Q6|5|I love this bra.  I ordered my true size and it fit perfect (34E/34DD).  It stayed in place
B00TZ7OULE|5|Love this skirt.  perfect color and very sophisticated.  Some pencil skirts are made of fabric that looks pretty sleezy but not this one!  Great for work or it can really be jazzed up for a fun evening out.
B0046HEHX4|5|great value
B002R9C91U|5|Far out man
B00CJR01AQ|5|The tee is great,great look ,fit,and color. It's a true to size small classic fit,I usually like slim fit but this one works happy
