159562015X|3.0|My unique combination seems to also make me automatically skeptical about these things. Well that, and a lot of statistical training that helps me better understand the way data is often data mined in non-valid ways. More than that though, it did have the quality of a horoscope. At the end of it I read off my top five, and was left with the feeling that I already knew that about myself. I'm curious about people that are so self-unaware that this information would be life changing.<br /><br />I'm at a cross-roads in my life and I got the book and took the test so I would get a better insight on what professions I would be happiest in, because perhaps there were a few that I might have misconceptions about. It was highly recommended to my by many professionals, so I gave it a shot. And, I would like to work with like individuals that are drawn to such professions. I didn't get that. I'm sure I would if I paid the $550 to sit down with a consultant. If I don't know where I can maximize my strengths in combination, then WTF?<br /><br />That and the fact that there's no algorithm designed to combine the top five into an amalgam. For example, my top three are:<br />1. Strategic 2. Ideation 3. Individualization<br /><br />That's true, so how do I find the right industry or position that blends contrary strengths like:<br />4. Activator 5. Command<br /><br />I'm left with the same issue I had before. I realized already that academia wasn't for me, because it's filled with people with my first 3 strengths, but annoyingly absent of my latter 2. The same with my time in the military, and business; full of the latter 2, and depressingly missing the first 3. I had decided to get my MBA and manage research to try to combine them, but would I be happy with that decision? Or, would I just waste a lot of time and money to prepare and train for an idealized position that doesn't really exist in the numbers necessary for me to have a shot at getting it? After reading the book and taking the test, I'm no closer to an answer. It was only after I took the test that I found from an official website:<br /><br />\\"The Clifton StrengthsFinder was designed for use in a purely developmental context. It is not designed to direct you into specific professions. Although certain themes do appear to be quite consistently dominant within certain professions, it would be wrong to say that a given profession requires dominant talents in certain themes. During our research, we discovered many individuals who were excelling in the same profession but who had very different top five themes.\\"<br /><br />This basically tells me that there is not statistical significance between people with different themes, and their success or happiness in various jobs. So then, what's the point of taking it? I already know what I'm good at, and what I'm bad at, and how these qualities affect me at work. Using your natural interests and talents to succeed is the default, go-to strategy for most people. Now what? It's all too teleological. It gives you knowledge without wisdom. Seriously, who hates math and isn't analytical, yet is working as a computer engineer? Who's a geek that loves facts, and logic, and without creativity that ended up as a fashion designer? The kind of people a book isn't going to help, that's who.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner finally set my thirst for a dystopian, set in crazy times with awesome back stories and great characters, to rest.  I couldn't stop reading it.  I wanted more.  I was mad at the last page, for it being the last page.  Then discovered that there are two more books and some of my anger left.  But only some.  Because I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />I loved this story.  Though at times Dashner does seem to like to describe things more than just let the story flow, I felt it worked well with this storyline.  I can only imagine what it would be like to wake up, only able to remember your first name, and trapped in a crazy glade full of other teenage boys.  I would be taking in my surroundings as well.<br /><br />I was part of this story.  While there was made-up lingo and phrases, Dashner did a great job of having you discovering them as the main character Thomas discovered them.  When you are confused, he is too.  Then gradually we all get it together and life is good.  Or as good as it can be.  Trapped in an seemingly impossible to solve Maze.<br /><br />There was a hint of a love story, but it really never focused on it.  The plot wasn't driven by gooey eyes and love triangles.  It was driven by one thing: Survival.  I loved having the MC be male.  That seems to never exist anymore.  It was so refreshing.  The relationship between Thomas and Teresa is very lightly touched on, enough that you know there is something there, but don't gag with cupid arrows either.  I am figuring there will be more on it in the future books.  For this one though, I got just the right dose.<br /><br />It felt... real.<br />I even got choked up at one point... I hope the characters felt me cheering for them.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a crazy, intense, different look on society and teenage boys.  Think Lord of the Flies meets Battle Royale (Hunger Games) with lots of Big Brother.<br /><br />Ok, I really dont know what else to say.  I could keep gushing, but that wouldmake for a long review where all I want to say is: READ THIS.  I don't want to reveal too much, because I honestly want you to discover this book for yourself.  I was thoroughly pulled into this story and loved every second of it.  I am itching for more, and know I will reread this book many times in the future.  The Maze Runner is my first official five-star review on this blog, and it deserves it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Well written.  Grabs the reader from the beginning.  You get involved in their lives and want to know more, but at the same time you cannot imagine you being in their world.  Or is this our future world?
B001P4ESFS|5.0|Is Season Two of DAMAGES as Compelling as Season One?<br /><br />It is but in a more subtle way. As far as intensity, it would be difficult to keep up the dramatic tension of the first series without wearing out viewers and morphing into something too melodramatic.<br /><br />Season Two is more nuanced but just as compelling and addictive.<br /><br />The season centers around the murder of a scientist's wife. Was she murdered because she knew too much about how a company was polluting its environs? The crimes are as complex as in Season One and many of the same characters return to lend cohesiveness to the story line. Ted Danson charms as Frobisher, Glenn Close is malevolently likeable as Patty Hewes, and you just wish Melissa Gay Harden would wear a bra that fits but it suits her rather blowsy character who sleeps her way to success or defeat.<br /><br />A riveting season--looking forward to seeing how the characters evolve in Season Three.
0439023483|3.0|An enjoyable read. Most of the story was predictable and the end lacked a fitting payoff. Some aspects were too unrealistic for my taste.

0061452068|4.0|A rare book indeed amidst the torrent of tomes focusing on the familiar horsemen of the apocalypse, whether they are of climate change, peak oil, overpopulation, pandemics or our heading towards the singularity.<br /><br />The author draws his optimism from the well of accumulated human knowledge and ingenuity. He sees humankind's collective brain as a `problem solving machine' and leads the reader engagingly through the bumpy history of cultural, technological and economic development from earliest Palaeolithic trade and proto-agriculture to our present global economy. He shows with just the right amount of statistical and comparative data the main reasons for the astonishing material betterment enjoyed by the masses today in relation to the times of the Sun King Louis XIV, let alone compared to earlier epochs. He shows how trade contributed to the fertility of ideas, how innovation, specialization, mechanization, division of labour, and so forth, coupled with free exchange of ideas and unfettered entrepreneurship are the foundations which make prosperity possible for the greatest number of people. He is highly critical of ideologies promoting self-sufficiency or top-down engineering, whether social or otherwise, and of those wanting to freeze technologies at a certain level, be they in agriculture or elsewhere. He also demonstrates clearly that all the regularly predicted `turning points' or thresholds, supposedly leading to imminent catastrophe in the past, were proven wrong each time and concludes that this will likely be true for the future too.<br /><br />As long as Matt Ridley stays with a historical narrative, he is on firm ground, and his book could be seen as a good riposte to economist Jeff Rubin, whose \\"Why Your World Is About To Get A Whole Lot Smaller\\" singles out peak-oil as the harbinger of severe economic adjustments. While Rubin's focus is in my opinion too narrow (see my respective Amazon book review), Ridley's treatment of what he calls \\"The Great Fears of Today\\" - Africa, Pandemics, Overpopulation, and Climate Change - strikes me as being too nonchalant. He posits that they are either not as significant as they are made out to be, or that they will be overcome with the usual human ingenuity, as have been other challenges in the past. And what is the basis for his confidence? - The simple extrapolation of the technological and economic success story since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution!<br /><br />The development of the highly technological society and socio-economic environment we have created and live in today is an all too short phenomenon in the human experience and should therefore raise serious questions about it being a valid yard stick for extrapolation into the future. After all, even his avowed optimism does not prevent the author from mentioning a few times, that decline and later disintegration of sophisticated societies and economic systems back into simple economies of self reliance and subsistence for reasons of politics, religion, pandemics, resource exhaustion or local climate change has been observed throughout history. So it could happen again, only on a much larger scale and with more dire consequences, considering today's global interconnectedness and large populations. And that is precisely where the Neo-Malthusians and other doomsayers come in.<br /><br />Although relegated by him to the margins, Matt Ridley's remarks nevertheless acknowledge that progress of the human species has never been, nor will it likely be in the future, a continuous \\"bull market\\". \\"Rational Optimism\\" should perhaps be rephrased to \\"Cautious Optimism\\" and elaborate a bit more on the inevitable bumps, washouts and landslides to be expected on the road ahead, especially since his timeline is only the next 100 years. Either way, this book is well worth reading and pondering about - a scholarly work covering a wide scope and written in very accessible prose.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The DVD arrived just as described: Like New.  No scratches or anything, just a bit of dust and maybe a little smudge, but nothing that a simple wipe wouldn't take care of.  GREAT show, of course :)
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My grand daughter, (who is one and a half) and I watch this daily! We love it ! We highly recommend this movie
B006QVRVJK|1.0|I was shocked that so far not one reviewer gave this a one star so allow me to be the first! This is by far one of the worst movies I have seen in years! With a film that stars Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet and directed by Roman Polanski how could it go wrong? I dont even know where to begin. Well, lets start with the plot, the entire movie all 75 minutes of it takes place in a small New York City apartment and the movie consist  of two couples arguing. Thats it, thats the movie, 75 minutes of agonizing and bitter dialogue. Kate Winslet at one point throws up(probably couldnt take the dialogue anymore). The Acting was terrible, Jodie and Kate overacted during the entire film and it came off like a really bad acting improv class! Even though it was mercifully only 75 minutes long, it seemed like 5 hours. I dont get what some people see in this film, are the people just starstruck? I am actually a huge fan of Kate Winslet, Jodie Foster and John C Reilly but they were all really bad in this! The entire film was a disaster. Watching Ice Melt is more exciting than watching this film!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|very fun but too easy... playing it on my android as it was only $0.99 there. I'll get it on my fire once it goes on sale.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|Somebody please tell me how trash like this gets made? Oh, I forgot. It was produced by Beyonce. Note to Beyonce: Please stay out of the movie making business. At any rate, I will give the credit to a friend who picked this movie out on DVD. After watching about 30 minutes, I couldn't bare it anymore. Completely unoriginal, full of cliches, predictable, borrrring!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I read all three books in the trilogy many months ago and I was really looking forward to the movie.<br /><br />Then, I found out that there is a 2001 Japanese movie called Battle Royale that was very highly rated by critics, so I rented it. Yes, Battle Royale is a fantastic movie (definitely recommended) and as I watched it became extremely obvious that Hunger Games was *stolen* from the plot of this movie.<br /><br />I'm not talking vague similarities, but almost-identical plot points and mechanisms -- and many of them.<br /><br />I can't believe that Suzanne Collins hasn't been sued by the creators of Battle Royale.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|I had this movie on DVD format.  I like it a lot more on Blu Ray 3D. I recomend it for family fun at home.
0385534639|4.0|Being on many \\"best of 2011\\" lists, The Night Circus has big shoes to fill for potential readers. For the most part, I thought The Night Circus lived up to the hype; it had an imaginative, whimsical quality about it that was engaging and refreshing. Some complain about the flowery prose, but I thought it added to the story's magical mood and ambience, the poetic descriptiveness mirroring the fanciful event that is the circus. The allusions to Shakespearean plays (the forbidden love between rivals, Prospero, etc) are a nice touch as well. Morgenstern uses the circus itself as her main protagonist, as components--time, people, events--revolve around it and are intertwined together.<br /><br />Several of the \\"other\\" main characters were a mixed bag. Celia and Marco--the key characters in the \\"bet\\" between the two magicians-- weren't as interesting to me as some others, maybe because I thought their \\"love\\" for each other was forced down our throats a little too much. Another thing that I found disappointing was simply that the key magicians in the novel (Marco, Celia, and Prospero) almost lacked human elements, coming across more like mythical puppeteers pulling strings and controlling things behind the scenes. The vignettes focusing on Bailey's fascination with the circus were the highlight of the novel; Morgenstern really shines connecting his story with the players in the circus. I also enjoyed the stories about the twins, Poppet and Widget, and their connection to the circus.<br /><br />While The Night Circus is impressive mostly, one slight annoyance is that the limitations of magic are never clearly determined, some illusions too far over-the-top. It's a book about magic and illusion, yes, but some parts strain believability (Marco changing his physical appearance on a whim, Prospero making his physical form vanish, etc). I thought most of the plot was relatively well-conceived, but then, towards the end, some of it was too hard to swallow. As a result, the endingwas a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />However, The Night Circus is an impressive debut for the author. Morgenstern has an effective way of building atmosphere with each of the various stories, with the circus its central figure. In this way, it is less about Marco or Celia or the contest they are involved in, and more about the existence of the circus through time.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love this game on my iPod. When I got my tablet, it was only natural to get this as well. Sadly, it always crashes... When it does work, it works great, but something is causing it to crash, and I don't know what. I hope for an update in the near future to fix the issue. Graphics don't bother me on my tablet. Also, to those saying there is no Zen garden or mini games, I seem to recall you needing to unlock them.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I can be somewhat of a recluse and so don't tend to engage too much in the likes of television very often, I prefer box sets... less ads!  So I wasn't privy to the hype that surrounded the approach of the release of this show, of which I have heard there was much of.  I found it by accident in my tiny small town Tasmanian DVD rental store.  I'm a long time fan of Sean Bean and have a tendency to froth at the mouth at the prospect of some buckling of swashes, so I thought to myself... \\"well why not!?\\"  I was not disappointed.  From the onset of the highly and fanstastically orchestrated title sequence I was powerfully drawn in to the high quality nature of the production.  The music is subtle, driving yet never heavy handed, the performances are impeccable as well as believably written, the action and political intrigue kept me bound to the screen, the set pieces squeal high quality and lightness of touch and the locations are almost characters in themselves.  Like Lord of the Rings meets the Tudors except... dare I say it, better!  Big call I know and I'm sure there will be many that dissagree, but this reviewer simply doesn't care.  I found this show to be deeply satisfying all round.  The only hole I could find was the dwarfs very occasional accent slip, but he was such an engaging character that I felt bound to excuse it.  Head and shoulders above recent sword based efforts such as the far too shiny, sloppy and occasionally plain daft 'Immortals'.  Watch on and have your swashes well and truly buckled!<br />[[ASIN:B007KTEFSC The Dastardly Mr Winkle Meets His Match (The Green Man)]]
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I read all the reviews & was worried about the \\"real\\" money issue, people saying a screen pops up saying \\"you don't have enough coins or gems\\" & then they click ok & it charges them. If you want to spend $ on coins & gems, feel free, but it's s not required.  I absolutely love this game & have NOT spent a penny to have a cute restaurant.  If you have played FB games you know you have the option to buy coins,  etc.  And if you have kids, activate the parental controls on your device.  I enjoy this game very much & look forward to socializing with my neighbors everyday.  Great app guys!<br /><br />If you get this app, add me...kernleigh.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|To be honest I wasn't immediately taken with this show.  The first episode had me sitting on tenterhooks as to whether or not I was going to start investing in it, but that all very quickly melted away.  Anna Torv, although startlingly attractive, had me somewhat perplexed.  For some reason I couldn't quite get behind her, later seasons have since taught my why that was and believe me, looking back, she has done a top notch job.  But the real reason to watch this bizarre cross universe, X-files like, whodunnit, fringe science extravaganza is the wonderful, the marvelous, the sensational John Noble (Lord of the Rings' Lord Denethor) as Walter Bishop.  I challenge you not to watch him and love him deeply.  A heavily emotionally and mentally disturbed Dr Frankenstien genius type, he just made the show.  Joined with the dynamic he shares with his son (Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop) the series just takes off into the stratosphere... of both universes.  With one foot in reality and one in crazed quantum physics and the world of the FBI, it sounds like it could be going a little too far but it doesn't.  The soundscape is tremendous, the tension palpable, an effects team second to none (joyfully abstaining from too much heavy handed GCI) genuinely chucklesome comedic moments mixed with some fine action and distinctly trippy story lines.  This will have you back on Amazon scanning for seasons two, three and four within minutes of its close.  Get hooked in!<br />[[ASIN:B007KTEFSC The Dastardly Mr Winkle Meets His Match (The Green Man)]]
0465043577|3.0|This book aims to introduce investors to fractal analysis. The main idea that Mandelbrot offers is that the markets are inherently more risky than conventional finance theory would have us believe. The principal reason for that is that the markets do not follow the classical random walk based on a normal distribution but are subject to much more violent perturbations based on the power law. As a result, modern portfolio theory and option pricing theory are wrong because they misjudge risk.<br /><br />While all of the above seems correct and there are no flaws in Mandelbrot's logic, the main flaw of the book is that it only looks at price movements themselves when building those fractal models. Fractals are a beautiful mathematical abstraction that seems to describe how markets move quite well. However, prices are not moved by previous prices (at least not to a significant extent) but by changes in the incoming information and in the investors' sentiment. In other words, prices are moved by fundamentals or changes in investors' expectations about fundamentals. Mandelbrot does not even attempt to explain how fundamentals affect asset prices - his sole focus in on price changes themselves. This fact makes this book an interesting read for a curious mind but not a guide for a practical investor.
B004132HZS|5.0|What can I say... I have been a Holmes fan for many many years... read the complete works, have the box set of the original 80s show, I think I even have a dear stalker and magnifying class somewhere.  Suffice to say that I'm a bit of a geek in this respect.  When the Guy Ritchie movie came out I was distinctly cautious, and rightly so it would seem but then came Sherlock.  A more comical, tense, perfectly written and acted version I have, quite frankly, never encountered.  I apologise if this upsets the fans of Jeremy Brett but I would say that I too loved his performance but this new realisation is nothing short of absolute perfection.  There are glorious nods to the original works and Holmes himself is perfectly realised both by the writers and Benedict Cumberbatch (a more holmes-esque name I cannot imagine) as the man himself.  Rather than portraying all those that aren't the master detective as simpletons, which has happened in the past, we are shown a true genius with many foibles with back up characters that ring true as intelligent human beings.  I remain speechless at the quality of Andrew Scott's deeply creepy Jim Moriarty,  I am gushing.... I love it love it love it!<br />[[ASIN:B007KTEFSC The Dastardly Mr Winkle Meets His Match (The Green Man)]]

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I, quite foolishly, hadn't realised that all of the characters in the show were based on real Pacific veterans.  I only found out after watching the series and found myself wanting more and so delved into the special features.  There were interviews with the survivors that almost brought tears to my eyes, enthralling making of documentaries and much more that empowered my already vast appreciation of this WWII epic.  The thing that struck me most was the expert use of, and sometimes lack of, colour and camera technique to generate some very gritty realism.  The effects department shines here, when shot there's no spaghetti western like shaking of the body before eccentrically swiveling round and dropping to the ground on behalf of the injured, no, I was genuinely shocked as they dropped like sacks of meat in brutal clouds of red as bullets ripped through them.  The basic horror of the Pacific war is genuinely disturbing here.  It was truly a brutal campaign and the makers of Pacific have outdone themselves in attempting to recreate the bloody, mud caked awfulness.  On top of that the shear weight of quality engaged here; the set-pieces that out-did Saving Private Ryan ten fold by the shear number that were built, the musical score, direction, supremely believable characters and weighty story lines made for an experience like nothing I'd seen before.  I believe it even surpassed Band of Brothers, which was a top quality show in itself.  I came away deeply shocked, touched and in awe of the men that fought those terrible battles.  I highly recommend it.<br />[[ASIN:B007KTEFSC The Dastardly Mr Winkle Meets His Match (The Green Man)]]

0439023521|5.0|Loved this book from the beginning, but didn't think I would. It was a friends recommendation. I'm well into the second book now, and loving the trilogy so far.  It starts rather quickly and you won't want to put it down.  The only complaint I had about the book was the abrupt end, but it seems to be seamed up in the next book.

Admittedly it is a bit cumbersome and I have a very difficult time getting the keyboard to appear on screen but I can put up with a little  inconvenience. Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased this after hearing the ladies on Good Morning America raving about it . . . what a let down.  This book is so redundant that I had to push myself to finish, which is rare.  There is very little substance to this story and it is so saturated with this &#34;erotic&#34; sex that it comes off as silly.  The story is rather juvenile and unless you're a teen looking for real trashy romance, I wouldn't bother.
B0063IH60K|5.0|No more no less. No frill solitaire game. Ads are there in between games but there's a great skip button. Played on the Kindle Fire.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Yes, I am a diehard Springsteen fan, so this is going to be far from a critical review (not that I can't be critical of even my most favorite performers; trust me, I can and have been). And I actually thought twice about buying this one after hearing a couple of songs, and even after seeing him perform on Jimmy Fallon's show; I just wasn't that taken, and wondered how many times I'd actually want to hear \\"Jack of All Trades.\\"<br /><br />Yet here I am, giving the CD its first full listen and knowing I'll be seeing him live on May 2nd -- in NJ, the promised land -- and damn, I'm just smitten! If the only good thing I got out of it was his tribute to Clarence in the liner notes, it would have been enough. But he and his newly composed band are rocking hard, and as I turn 54 next month it gets more and more important for me to have a hero like Bruce keeping the heart and soul of rock 'n roll alive and well.<br /><br />He may not be perfect but he's still vital and fresh and working it like his life and our emotional well-being depends on it. This is no oldies act -- the man does not rest on his laurels, and Lord knows he could after all these years. \\"Baby You Got It\\" is on now, and it lands right in the pantheon of \\"Cross My Heart\\" (similar rhythmic line), \\"She's The One,\\" \\"Fire,\\" etc. I love that he tries new sounds, different back-up singers and players. I love that, while it always sounds like Springsteen music, it's not the same old, same old. Oh my, I am one happy Jersey girl...while it's no longer my home, he makes me proud to have been born and raised there.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I wasn't that big on the movie, but was totally stoked over this spine-tingling score. Any fan of electronica and classical scores will enjoy this soundtrack.<br /><br />I'm a Daft Punk fan and it's true that this soundtrack doesn't full-blown reflect their typical work (some tracks like Derezzed ring more with their typical style) but listening to what they could do with a full orchestra at their disposal shows that they are way more talented than anyone could have ever imagined.<br /><br />Some of the tracks on here are just plain....EPIC (ex: Solar Sailor). This soundtrack is seriously worth the buy.
B003Z0D4SM|4.0|The setting of the story and places mentioned were unfamiliar, but the story and<br />unfolding of the events was cleverly outlined. The character and mind set of the girl was extremely interesting as was the climax of the novel.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I thout this game makes you think a lot. but its a good brain User. the game also isn't very fast to complete which is another reason why its so fun.
0439023491|5.0|This book was good. Not as good as the first book and not as good as the third book, but still good. I think it has that \\"middle book in a trilogy\\" issue going on.<br /><br />I don't want to say much about the plot of the book because it seems like with all three of these books, saying anything before someone has read it is giving away big pieces of the plot. Even if you say a character's name, then the reader knows who lived!<br /><br />This book is about the aftermath of what happened at the 74th Hunger Games. The champion is sent home, lives in a special Victor Village, and halfway through the year tours the districts, kind of like the American Idol tour. As alluded to in the first book, there are rumblings of a revolution going through the districts, and the tour fuels the fire of these rumblings.<br /><br />Good middle book. Read it and move on to finish the series! If you're getting bored or bogged down at the beginning of the book, the last third of the book picks up a lot!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a movie my family watches every year for Christmas and never grows tired of,was worth purchasing. I would recommend it for others as well.
0439023513|5.0|Ahhhhhh, and now what does one do when they've finished a series like this?<br /><br />Honestly, if you're interested in reading this book, just go and do it. Reading any and probably all reviews will give away what happens. Even reading the book description gives away more than what I would have wanted to know before reading. If you read the first one and liked it, just read them all. If you haven't read the first one, read that description and go from there.<br /><br />I think this book wrapped up the series nicely. I never know how to feel when a series finishes. Yes, everything was closed up and accounted for, but I guess I was left wanting more. I became really invested in the characters and wanted more to happen.<br /><br />Great ending to a fantastic series.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|My students got me hooked on this game and now I have all versions.  It is addictingly fun.  I am crazy and let my before-school students get past the levels I have trouble with.  The bonus for me is the peace and quiet it creates.  $3 is chump change and I didn't mind spending it.  Self addmitted angry bird fiend!
1612130283|4.0|I jumped on the bandwagon like everyone else here, I must admit. I was really pretty shocked with the amount, detail and style of sex in the book. At first it freaked me out, and to be totally honest I got a little tired of it. I hung in there for the whole trilogy and I have come to love the books. The reality is that all of that stuff in the first book really is a gateway to a great love story and it does give you the necessary background to understand a complicated set of characters. I suppose my recommendation is to just hang in there and read the whole set and you will be very glad you did!
B000FA5STS|4.0|I thought this was a very good book.Again David Baldacci did a good job with the characters and getting you root for the good guys.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app allows me to read what I want, when I want and if I don't have my kindle?  I can keep up online!  its got a wide variety of versions for those with different reading comfort zones from the KJV to the NIV to the GNT to other languages!  you gotta check this out!  You can get this app on your phone AND your kindle. (not currently avail on the Nook, though...)  It's awesomely divine!  you can work with the app to go at your own pace to read through the whole Bible...one section at a time :-)

076115678X|1.0|DevaCurl Styling Cream and the products in this line are terrible it turned my hair dry and afro. The book was not that great either. They assume all black people who have natural curls have only fractal curls and like the afro look. The pic of Beyonce is a weave insult. I will be going back to WEN, Tigi Curls Rock and relaxers to loosen the curls to make them presentable.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|Don't bother spending your money.  This movie is nothing more than a brainwashing attempt by Hollywood.  They try to evoke children's emotions by global warming as happening.  I will be trashing the copy I bought so no one else experiences this pure trash.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the best angry birds yet if you like angry birds you'll love this in space floating a bunch of stuff

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This copy of Firefly was ordered as a birthday gift for a good friend of mine. It arrived promptly and he was able to being enjoying this show right away. In short...\\"everything's shiny Cap'n\\". I recommend both this show and seller to any buyer.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|a note to rovio,  please make this app free every time I try getting the app it doesn't let me ERROR.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie was another part of a present I ordered for a friend, and arrived promptly in brand new condition for him to enjoy. Though I'm sure we all lament having a movie to close the Firefly series rather than the many more seasons it deserved, this film is a must for any Joss Whedon/Firefly fan. Thanks for the quick delivery of a great gift!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the games and so do my kids. And you cant beat the price. I like how the challenges are all copleyely different..
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Fantastic app. I use it as my word processor app just like it says and then email my work to my email account through its own options. It saves automatically and even has auto back up. It has no word or entry limits. You can make multiple daily entries. You can even use it as a journal if you want. I couldn't find a good free journal for the Kindle Fire and this works just great. I havn't tried saving one like a sticky to my Kindle Fire desktop yet but I will.  Colors make it cute if you want.  I love it when app gurus make a great app like this and then give it to us for free and with no ads! Can't say enough about Color Note except thanks!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Tried to get the sticky to appear on the Kindle Fire desktop but I couldn't do it. Maybe someone else can. I just know I couldn't. But I'm not taking away any stars because that wasn't what I got it for to begin with. It just would have been an added little bonus!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app and the ads don't bother me like other review mentioned it is fun to open new games and play old ones.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I use this device to play MMO. It works fine. It took me some time to learn and program but it sure beats using keyboard and mouse. A lot of people complain about the joystick on the right side but I am ok with it. It would be good though if there is an option to change the joystick to the left (for the right handed folks.) The joystick is not as accurate as trackball. Maybe they can make a version with trackball. The tutorial is ok but sure can use some improvements. It is just plain texts. The flash (interactive) demo/tutorial is just silly as if we don't know how to plug it in. I also find the interface awkward but I maybe just too picky.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It was working great until I decided I wanted to download more videos then whenever I selected a video and hit download as a video, I would check the videos downloading and it would say file size not available yet. I have plenty of data room available. I have unistalled and reinstalled this app like 5 times and I have to the settings on my kindle and force stopped this app as well as erase all data on the app to make room but nothing works!
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|I loved this book, which was a selection of my book club. Several other members bought traditionally bound books to our discussion, so I saw how much my Kindle version lacked, especially a photo which would have added to my enjoyment. The e-book  also lacked the Discussion Topics for Book Clubs in the back, which I always enjoy pondering whether I'm reading for Book Club or not. Given these missing parts & my reading preferences, the Kindle-version was not worth the small amount saved (over the paperback).
0375869026|5.0|I found this book surprisingly engaging, entertaining, and compelling. The section that got me the most was Via's, but I love the book as a whole. It really exceeded my expectations.
B003O86FMW|3.0|*********SPOILERS*********** AHEAD IF U HAV NOT READ DONT READ ON**********<br /><br />WHY DID COLLINS KILL PRIM! THAT MOVE TOTALLY UNNESASARY BY FAR!!! and katniss was not her self. wtf happened to gale!? it got really oufusing at the end when it didnt have to be confusing a all. OK SO COINS BAD OR IS SHE GOOD? im leaning towards bad beause katniss shot her in the head. so collins why do u have to be so depresssing? i thought the first was a little depressing then the second was pushing and the third struck homehow can a book be so well sad because of that one thing  the  DEATH OF PRIM! it was a leaning towards a bad one. i might never read that book again. plus poor finnick and annie. just gt maried and BAM HE DIES and shes stuck with no onebut her  crazy self and a baby! ad the hijack of pita got confusing and uncalled for.if the goverment was that bad i would have swalled tha night lock in book one. but no collins had to drag it out to three sad books. i thought when rue died that was the most sad thing in thr book oh ya wy did thry change her into a  mutt its bad as it is that she died. collins whats it with u and killing people from the star squad what ever. so disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought \\"Hunger Games\\" was targeted towards older girls.  For this reason I was surprised by how gritty, violent, and unromantic the story is.  I admired Collins' courage in making Katniss (the protagonist) pretty unlikable.  In some ways, she is the traditional hero: brave, moral, and focused.  At moments, she is unapologetically heartless.  She goes against gender stereotypse far beyond the point at which is cool.  I found her fascinating.<br /><br />The story is simple (and possibly stolen), but it is intense and easy to read.  I finished the book in about three sittings.  At the same time, I had no interest in continuing the series.  \\"Hunger Games\\" does everything a story is supposed to do and ends (almost) cleanly.  If you don't feel like committing yourself to a series, don't let that stop you from reading the first book.
B0000025JT|5.0|GUILTY is generally considered Streisand's best \\"pop\\" recording.  I tend to agree.  The union of Barbra and Barry Gibb was strategically brilliant.  Gibb, Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson's production put Babs in a whole new arena for the legendary singer.  The trademark Bee Gees sound blends incredibly well with the inimitable vocals and produces some of Babs' best recordings.<br />GUILTY generated three huge singles:  WOMAN IN LOVE and her two duets with Barry--the title track and WHAT KIND OF FOOL.  My favorite track however is the gorgeous THE LOVE INSIDE---it still gives me chills.  The remaining tracks are all good tunes and GUILTY is certainly a pinnacle in Streisand's 40+ years of recording.
1586487981|4.0|It's nice to be able to summarize a book's message in a catchy slogan.  This is not one of those books.  The lesson I learned from \\"Poor Economics\\" is that there is no 'pure philosophy' that will lead to the end of global poverty.  The answers are complicated and need to be examined on a case by case basis.  Most of the time when you ask, \\"will this work,\\" the answer is \\"kind of.\\"<br /><br />I read this book about 2 months ago.  I remember the subjects that were covered and some of the conclusions.  At the same time, I am frustrated by how much I have forgotten.  The authors' stubborn obsession with nuance makes it hard to remember everything.  It's not an easy book to work into conversation.  This book is much more intellectually rewarding than it is fun to read.
0375869026|5.0|Auggie (short for \\"August\\") is an adolescent boy with a disfigured face entering the 5th grade.  Having been home-schooled previously, it's his first time in a public school setting where he has to interact with other kids.  This is difficult enough for a child who isn't disfigured, so imagine how hard it is for Auggie.<br /><br />Auggie has the support and love of his parents and older sister, but he longs to be \\"normal.\\"  The author, R.J. Palacio, presents a believable story of August's first year in a public school setting as he interacts with other students; some kind, some not-so-kind.  Palacio presents an accurate depiction of kids; their attitudes, thoughts, and feelings; and that longing to be popular and fit in.<br /><br />The book starts out from Auggie's sensitive point of view as he tells his story.  I was really enjoying reading the first 75 pages of the book when the author did something that I typically dislike and has become too commonplace: she changed the story's point of view (POV).  Now we're viewing the story through Auggie's sister's eyes.  But it doesn't stop there.  The POV changes several more times before coming back to Auggie.  That's when I discovered that this storytelling device actually worked for this particular novel.  Each change of POV filled in the blanks from the previous stories and POVs, and then moved the overall story along.<br /><br />Book don't typically elicit a lot of emotion for me like seeing the story up on the big screen does.  However, with WONDER, I have to admit that I occasionally felt tears of happiness at the kindness expressed by people around Auggie, as well as sadness during the rough spots.  The story was really sweet and it has a fantastic message.  Although this book is marketed for \\"young adult,\\" it's a great read for all ages.  It teaches manners, respect, appreciation, and, most importantly, kindness.  It's relatable for anyone who felt like they didn't fit in.  I highly recommend buying and sharing this book.<br /><br />P.S. The title of the book comes from Natalie Merchant's song \\"[[ASIN:B00125U27I Wonder]].\\"  If you read the lyrics, you'll see that the subject matter fits this novel to a T.s book.<br /><br />P.S.

0812550706|5.0|There are no children in the world who talk like Ender and his siblings.  The main story is quite predictable and the side story is quite ridiculous.  The ending was somewhat unsatisfying.<br /><br />Everything else is perfect.  Lots of books have characters which the author explicitly designates as a \\"genius.\\"  Orson Scott Card, instead, has his character demonstrate his genius.  Ender's social maneuvering and internal dialogue persuaded me of his brilliance.  The idea that a little boy could be humanity's best hope seems like an absurd premise.  Ender's Game made me believe it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|everyone is saying there is popup ads but theres not on my kindle fire it works great but they need to put more videos up
0618871713|3.0|Bechdel's father was an intriguing enough character to keep me reading.  Other than that, the story seemed aimless and pretentious.  I did not have much interest in Alison's exploration of her homosexuality, and the references to literature and philosophy seemed present for the purpose of the author's bragging rather than advancing the story.  There is real shortage of autobiographical graphic novels, but this one is probably my least favorite of those I have read so far.
B001B68XRY|5.0|This is an awesome movie so i bought it  for presents for my family and friends, and they all enjoyed the movies also.
0439023491|1.0|The \\"Hunger Games\\" left us with Panem teetering on revolt, and while that's very much in the background of the first two thirds of \\"Catching Fire\\" we don't get to spend much time with the lofty consequences and social questions surrounding Katniss's act of rebellion. Instead we get a poorly written, boring rerun of book one. The first person narrative drags the plot down, washes out the setting, and ruins the rich themes of agency and individuality that made the young characters and the harsh world very intriguing in book one. A disappointing step back.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Crashed big time caused major problems for Help Desk.  Several times of contact to get them to find an answer. Finally!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I must say I haven't read a good story line like this one in years. I couldn't put either 3 books down. I delayed sleeping just to read these books. I am so in love with Christian & Ana that I've read this trilogy twice. I just hope all of James future work is like Fifty Shades because I think I found a favorite new Author.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|I highly recommend this movie- it was touching and played so very well by all the characters. There was faith (most important), action and drama- it was a great mix of what makes a great movie plus the message is key! The church I attend played the movie for all the men at a bible study and then brought all the members who wanted to see it in for a view. It was great fellowship.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this Bible app for my Kindle, and iPod. This is the best I have found for both devices. There are so many daily devoitionals to pick from to guide you through the Bible scriptures. This is a wonderful way to read God's word and spend some time daily with our Father.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Calming... This game is truly original and relaxing as Mahjong should be. No crazy frills. Just what I was looking for to add to my Kindle Fire.
B006470HZ6|5.0|I have no idea what all the negative reviews are about.  The pace isn't as wild and hectic as a horror movie, but that is why I like this show.  GREAT character development, moral dilemmas, continuous internal struggles every episode, great acting, and always a few thrills and heart stoppers.<br /><br />I hope this show keeps going, it is an instant classic.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Foster The People remind me of some of the synth-oriented New Wave bands from the 80's.  Their songs mix elements of rock and roll, electronica, and pop.  Their song lyrics are sometimes hard to decipher, but they are easy to sing along to.<br /><br />All ten songs on this album follow this format.  The songs are experimental - they do not follow a generic format. Yet, the best songs are accessible to the pop mainstream since they are so catchy. Indeed, they are one of the few indie-dance bands that have made it into the top 40 charts.<br /><br />The first four tracks - \\"Helena Beat\\", \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", \\"Call It What You Want\\", \\"Don't Stop (Color On The Wall)\\", as well as \\"Houdini\\", are the strongest five songs on the album. The first four are the first four singles off the album. These songs happen to be to most upbeat, sunny, and cheery songs on the album. Unless you've living in a cave, you've heard their biggest hit \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" by now.  Like \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", the other singles also have hard-hitting percussion (electric and real) that you can bop your head to or dance to. \\"Helena Beat\\" and \\"Houdini\\" are my favorite songs from the album.<br /><br />The other songs on the album are decent as well, and blend in well with the stronger songs. They are somewhat slower and less cheery than the above-mentioned tracks. My only complaint with the album overall is that every song has similar elements. It would have been nicer to see it varied a bit<br /><br />If you like music the mixes rock with electronic elements, or music that is experimental but `pop' at the same time, this album is highly recommended.  Looking forward to see what Foster the People come up with next.

B005UDD1R6|5.0|This app neatly integrates my music, pics, and movies into an easy to use, intuitive user interface.  No need for anything else.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|John Hiatt is one of the greatest songwriters of the past 30 years. I've bought every album that he has released; I enjoy his music that music. While I like all of his albums (really, there's not a dud in the bunch). every once in a while he will put out something that really captures my fancy. And this new album does just that. Some outstanding examples of Hiatt's songwriting genius on here. I particlarly like the two geographic tunes: \\"Train to Birmingham\\" and \\"Adios to California.\\" Hiatt fans will find a lot to like here.
B0063IH60K|5.0|always fun, and the hints are nice! I like the autocomplete option, too. fun and easy to use. overall, a must-have app
B000002MUN|5.0|I've been a big Tom Petty fan since the very first album. The first 3 albums by Petty and the Heartbreakers still stand as one of the greatest, most breathtaking musical trilogies in the rock era. Really, they are that wonderful. But I somehow got \\"away\\" from Petty in the 90s, no doubt stuck in some sort of \\"alternative rock\\" phase, and so I missed out on \\"Wallflowers\\" the first time around. Finally bought a copy last month and I'm hooked. Great songs, that Petty twang, and another ace band. Not much to quibble with here; this is just great, classic, American rock.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great. this game is clean. it doesn't say any dirty words or show a privite part. this game is alright for kids and you.should get it.
B004HGBUVG|4.0|I was very impressed with this new Lucinda Williams album. I think it contains some of the strongest material she's released in the past decade. It's hard to top a classic like \\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,\\" and I don't think it's fair to expect her to, but I'll settle for solid albums like this one anytime. It sounds like she really put a lot of energy and passion into these new songs. It works for me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are very fun. Some are very easy.  Some can get a  little hard. Some times the finger movement can be difficult . The adds are nice and small. Plus you get points for trying to complete a game.
B000002ITW|5.0|Maybe I'm biased because I owned this as a teenager, and have worn through copies on 8-track tape, cassette, vinyl, and now CD. But I deeply love this recording and think it's an excellent live document of a great band in its prime. Most of the \\"hits\\" are here (yeah, you can cry about certain favorites being left off, but this is a live show, not a greatest hits package) and there are also some fun surprises such as \\"King Midas in Reverse\\" (a tune Graham Nash did with the Hollies\\"). The only real low point, to my ears, is the version of Crosby's \\"The Lee Shore.\\" Still puts me to sleep. But other than that slip, you have soaring harmonies, guitar abandon (the Neil Young medley on here is on fire!), and lots of beauty. The closing number, the accapella version of \\"Find the Cost of Freedom\\" moves me every time. Maybe not perfect, but this live album is a great listen, and the new CD version contains extra tracks that weren't on my vinyl and, um, 8-track versions. Love this one.
B00479SVBU|5.0|When I first received the unit, the remote control would not make a connection to the unit. I contacted customer service by email, and received a reply in a few hours. The remote control was promptly replaced without my having to return the one that came with the unit. It packs a lot in its small size and is well worth the cost.

B004HV54TU|5.0|I have been using a large vertical mouse for over two years and struggling with it, waiting for a small wireless option.  Well, I finally purchased the small wired model and am in love.  This is the best mouse in the world.  Fits my hand like it was custom made.  I have three employees at work using vertical mice. Everyone loves it.  Highly recommend it.  This model is metallic purple and gets warm to the touch, which is actually kind of nice if you have arthritis!  Plus - it looks really cool.
B00006LLLN|3.0|The music on this album is first rate and would have been enjoyable if the unruly audience had not been so loud and allowed to overwhelm the sounds being created on stage.  Stick with the remarkable studio recordings!
B005C7SXMS|4.0|This is a quirky film about some quirky kids. Quirky is the key word here. If you enjoy films like Napoleon Dynamite and Harold and Maude then you will be right at home here with this film. It's also about being young and growing up as a fringe kid, left of center and with more than a few growing pains. It's not a mind blowing film but it is funny and charming and can easily be re-watched if you enjoy it. many films nowadays can not be sat through more than once even if they are decent. This one is better than that.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Even if you are not a dog person or even a pet owner, this is a book you should read. Told from the dogs perspective, Enzo becomes so human you may find yourself looking at every dog you meet differently. A warning, don't read this book in public because you will find yourself laughing out loud and then within a page or two be blubbering like a baby as Enzo tells his story from puppyhood through his final days. This is a perfect book for anyone who has ever lost a faithful companion or has a special dog nearing the end of his life!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I kept seeing the three books of The Hunger Games with high ratings but I thought, \\"not my kind of book.\\"  Well, I used  my Amazon Prime membership priviledge of borrowing the book and I was hooked!  From the beginning of the first book to the end of the third book I was enthralled and couldn't put them down.  A futuristic book great for teens but exciting enough for adults of all ages.  And now there is a movie!  Take a chance, maybe get a sample on your Kindle.  You won't regret it.<br />Happy reading.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Just Got it 3/22 and couldn't wait to play it. The disc loaded quickly on my OPPO BDP-93. The first thing I noticed was picture quality is better than the previous Blu-ray of \\"Live at the RAH\\", sharp and never out of focus, good color and without the white saturation.<br /><br /> The Sound quality is spectacular in DTS Master Audio! You can clearly hear every note being played at all times from all the band members, what struck me was the drums being so sharp and having very good punch and snap. Excellent micing and mix, hats off to the sound engineer guys, one of the best I've heard.<br /><br />  The opening is JB playing acoustic guitar in the NY subway and then jumps to the Beacon Theater where Joe struts his stuff.<br />His rendition of Gary Moore's \\"Midnight Blues\\" is to die for, the best version I've heard. Check out the guitar he uses on \\"Bird on A Wire\\" watch how it changes color and patterns. JB never ceases to amaze me, he might be one of the best musicians (not just guitar players) alive today. I think what makes him so enjoyable to keep listening to is he plays a different guitar on every song. Each of those guitars have a different sound and he makes them work, sound wise, with each song so the sound is not fatiguing.<br /><br />Beth Heart is worth the price alone on \\"I'll Take Care Of You\\". Paul Rogers was impressive, he might even sound better now than he did with \\"Free\\" or \\"Bad Company\\". John Hiatt's section was very good also, \\"Down Around My Place\\", a typical Hiatt song, was extremely entertaining due to Joe's excellent guitar playing.<br /><br /> With out hesitation this is a must have for anyone who collects Concert Video's, is a JB fan, a blues fan, etc... etc.... just get it you wont be disappointed! Now I'm just waiting for the new CD \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\" where he goes back to basic blues tunes.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.<br /><br />1. Performance<br />2. Quality of Audio<br />3. Quality of Video (for DVDs and Blu-ray's)<br /><br />1.*****<br />2.*****<br />3.*****<br /><br />Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.br /><br />1. Performance<br />2. Quality of Audio<br />3.

B004ZG5EYC|5.0|Amelie is without a doubt one of the most witty, funny, and universally charming films ever made. This film should be in everyone's rainy day collection. It never fails to warm my heart and cheer me up. People far more eloquent than me have been gushing about the sublime story, acting, and direction for the last decade since the film's release. I'll be content to gush about the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />WOW! Beyond every endearing aspect of this film in an emotional and intellectual sense, it is a cinematographic splendor of eye candy. I remember being amazed by its visual beauty when the film was first released, the Blu-ray technology is splendidly  rendered in this remarkably beautiful film. The colors pop and burst in each seen. The color Green is so present in this film, it's is like a character in its own right. Every hue is magnificently rendered in the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, there are a lot (six 2+ minute length) of previews on the Blu-ray that you have to fast-forward individually, which is always disappointing on a non-rental disc.<br /><br />Whether or not to upgrade films to Blu-ray is entirely dependent upon the quality of the transfer. A lot of care and expertise went into this transfer. It is gorgeous! Highly recommended!
B006W5JF9Y|1.0|I was excited about this, but it is impossible to listen to. There are a few saving graces, but otherwise, save your money.

B003274QH6|5.0|It is almost difficult to put into words what makes Breaking Bad such a hilarious an riveting show. The seriousness of the subject material with the real-world personalities of the characters with the perfect spice of humor in places. The Blu-ray pack has two discs for the season, quality is great and sound is crisp, extras are great, could use more commentary but some behind the scenes videos make it worthwhile to spend more time with the discs than the episodes offer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool game just started and not had a problem yet.  great time killer.  good for down time.  try it out.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|Book had some great parts that peeked my interest, but there were other parts that seemed like they were added just to make the book longer.  I could have easily been 800 pages instead of 1000.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have been playing the free version on my droid and love it! But not enough to pay 3 bucks for my Kindle Fire to have it, really hope you guys come out with a free version on here.
B0057VDGNK|2.0|A couple good songs. The rest is score made for the movie and its not really music. I'd call the score just background sounds. Just buy the songs you like individually. The score is not worth listening to.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading the HUNGER GAME TRILOGY.. Book 2 was my favorite. Looking forward to seeing the movie... If you are looking for a good read this is it.If I may suggest read the books before you see the movie!!!!
0307352145|5.0|Our culture does not appreciate quiet. We tend to equate social power with social prowess. The outspoken people seen are as the leaders in our culture. Susan Cain, however, seeks to dispel this notion that people with a quiet nature cannot be major influencers or leaders. She opens her book Quiet by discussing one of the most influential figures in the civil rights movement. Rosa Parks made an impact in the civil rights movement through her quietness. She chose to take a quiet stand instead of being outspoken. In doing so, she became a symbol of strength in the movement. This is the first of many examples of introverts that Cain offers to show the power of quiet in a world that likes to talk.<br /><br />Quiet is Cain's attempt to prove that, despite America's preference to extroversion, introverts can be extremely successful and influential in our culture. She begins by discussing the \\"Extroverted Ideal.\\" Since the time that Andrew Carnegie taught us how to win friends and influence people, the ideal personality has be extroverted. In the world of business and leadership, the way to get ahead is to speak up and stand out. Cain visits Harvard Business School to understand how they teach students to succeed in business. It becomes very clear that Harvard teaches their students to speak up or they won't succeed. The issue that Cain finds, however, is that in all their talking, people aren't listening. In this first part of the book, Cain poses the question of whether or not the extroverted ideal is really ideal. What she finds is people being trained to talk the most, whether they are educated or not, in order to get ahead.  Businesses promote group brainstorming which tends to favor the outspoken. Cain instead shows that often people who quietly, by themselves, and are allowed to think through the problems are more productive and effective that people working together in groups where people are fighting for attention. While the outspoken standout, they are not always bringing success and are often times talking over those who can give good ideas.<br /><br />The next part of here book looks at the biology and psychology behind introversion. Cain seeks to discover if introversion genetic. This section is much different that the first part of the book, but still interesting. I found this section of the book personally interesting because I read through it going, \\"Oh, That's why I am like that.\\" Introversion and extroversion seems to be built into our brain functions even from birth. It effects the way we think and process information.<br /><br />The third part of Cain's book compares our culture with Asian cultures to see if the Extroverted ideal is apparent in all cultures. Cain shows that there are major differences between the two cultures. America sees extroversion as ideal, while Asian cultures see introversion as ideal. One of the primary differences is how success is achieved. Introverted cultures tend to succeed through persistence and perseverance, while extroverted cultures succeed but speaking over others and getting your ideas heard. Cain uses this to show the some of the people we see as successful succeeded because of persistence instead of outspokenness.<br /><br />Last, Cain discusses living as an introvert and with introverts. She applies what she's discussed in previous sections to having relationships, working in an extroverted culture, and raising introverted children. This section is a good balance to the rest of the book which is trying to show that extroversion is not the ideal. Cain reminds her readers that sometimes introverts do need to speak up, but should also not lose the good qualities that introversion brings. She also offers very good practical information on how to live in introvert-extrovert relationships and how to raise introvert children.<br /><br />Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking is a great book. Susan Cain does a good job of presenting how our culture favors extroversion and looks down on introverts. It may seem at first that Cain is trying to say that introverts are better than extroverts, but reading through the whole work she does a wonderful job of challenging introverts to grow in certain areas. She also challenges extroverts to consider the benefits that introverts are able bring. As an introvert myself I most appreciated the second and fourth sections of the book. I was very interested to learn about myself and why I am the way I am. The second section does a good job of explaining many the biological factors of introversion and extroversion. The fourth section is very helpful because of the helpful advice for living with extroverts and raising and teaching introverted children.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to just about anyone. If you are an introverted, you will find this book very helpful and encouraging. If you are an extrovert, you can learn why your introverted friends are the way they are and how to best interact with them. I would highly recommend this book to anyone in a business situation, this book can be really helpful in learning how to get the most out of the introverts in your office. I would also recommend it to my friends in the ministry along with Adam S. McHugh's book [[ASIN:0830837027 Introverts in the Church: Finding Our Place in an Extroverted Culture]]. I hope that Cain's book will help people change their understanding of introversion. Introversion is not a weakness. There may be areas where introverts are weak, but there are always areas where introverts tend to be stronger than extroverts.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.xtroversion and looks down on introverts.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this with low expectations. Some of the other reviews are a bit harsh, so I was doubtful I would like the quality and feel of the case. It has exceeded my expectations. The case holds the Kindle Fire well, it has never fallen out or seemed loose in any way. The cover easily folds behind the kindle and props it up to lay it on its side. I usually use the folding option when in bed and want to watch a show/movie. It almost never falls back besides when my cat jumps on the bed next to it. I highly reccomend this product, great price and great case!
630471193X|5.0|Parts of this movie were filmed near our home town of Auburn, CA.  so we definitely wanted to watch it for that very reason.  It was by far a sad, but sweet movie and to critique a \\"sweet drama\\" such as this is ridiculous.  Watch it with your loved one or best friend and afterwards say \\"thank you for everyday that I have with you\\".
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read these after a friend recommended them. I don't usually read teen books, they lack the detail I'm used to and well, I'm too old for them now anyway. BUT, I do not regret buying these at all. I was hooked right from the beginning. It really is such a great story and mirror of our society. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes to think and to anyone who likes awesome female heroines (let's face it - we all want to be Katniss now!)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good quality, fun to play, addictive. Easy to play for the most part. Some games aren't very entertaining. I recommend it.
B00004BZ16|4.0|SANDINISTA got many many great songs...But what i really don´t understand is why so many songs?? There´s many good songs but also got lots of filler tracks... I love CLASH, but i think this is too much...The 2 discs journey is soooo long with sooooo many songs....They should pick the best songs and put many out of this album...besides that, there´s great stuff on SANDINISTA like THE MAGNIFICIENT 7, SOMEBODY GOT MURDERED, LET´S GO CRAZY, POLICE ON MY BACK, THE CALL UP and LOSE THIS SKIN!!!!
0670022950|5.0|This is an outstanding book,  so much so that I'll probably buy a copy as soon as the paperback version comes out.  Since I am a Certified Public Cheapskate, and already having trouble finding bookshelf space, this is high praise!  I cannot remember ever buying a  book after reading a library copy, except when our book discussion group later decided to use it.<br /><br />Pinker correctly says that this analysis is \\"unsentimental history\\" based on \\"statistical literacy.\\"<br /><br />A great strength of this work is Pinker's extensive and persuasive documentation of how violent and nasty life in previous centuries  was.  The massive torture of people and animals in the past, which Pinker does not shrink from describing in gory detail, is sobering and depressing, but very educational.<br /><br />Pinker admits that we are far from having arrived at utopia.  But  a number of graphs illustrate how the chances of being murdered or raped over the long haul have been greatly reduced from one century to another,  and even the likelihood (expressed as a percentage of the current populations) of being killed in wars has gone way down.<br /><br />The author capably explores a number of possible explanations for the improvements, accepting some and rejecting others.<br /><br />Although Pinker's thesis is very upbeat, he pointedly refrains from arguing that the trends toward improvement he documents will inevitably continue.  He says our appropriate attitude should be \\"gratitude\\" rather than \\"optimism.\\"<br /><br />This book would make a wonderful basis for reading and discussion in college political science classes, and its 700 pages (before footnotes kick in)  would probably mean it would have to be the main text for a one-semester undergraduate class.

0316044695|5.0|I am surprised at how many reviews this book has received, OVER 1,500 at this time! I am also surprised that so many give it a bad or poor review, approximately 200. That is only 12% of the reviews but some were really unreasonable and seemed to MISS the purpose of the book. The PURPOSE is to tell 'The Story', to tell WHAT HAPPENED to a Navy Seal team.<br /><br />One negative review really took the book to task that the Team had even considered killing some civilian goat herders. Whether it was right or wrong is NOT the point. The point is that they DID consider it. They discussed it but like all good Americans they DID NOT kill the goat herders, even though in the end three of them WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THE GOAT HERDERS!<br /><br />Some people criticized the book because of some errors in the book. Well when you have a book that is OVER 450 pages, with the storyteller and the writer being two different people, errors are not uncommon. One critic even got his criticism WRONG, criticizing that on page ## it said \\"226\\" when in fact it said 228 (two-two-eight), not 226! You know sometimes there are light spots in the printing. How much would it take to make an 8 look like a 6 ?<br /><br />SOME people just HAVE TO give EVERYTHING a bad review!<br /><br />However, THESE PEOPLE are NOT writing a book review. This is not an English major's text book! And it is not the place to say something happened or did not happen, when you were not even there! Nor is it the time to say they did this or did that wrong! It is not a debriefing session!<br /><br />Writing a book review is NOT about playing a Monday quarterback, and critiquing what 'they did', whether it was right or wrong. Rather it is to REVIEW THE BOOK.<br /><br />I am not SF and never have been, but I was in the Navy for four years, during the beginning of Nam. I am also a retired police officer. I was top-gun (pistol and rifle) for over five years. I studied, practiced and worked hard at being the one of the BEST police officers, and one of the best shooters in the department. I also got into being a gunsmith and built my own sniper rifle, able to keep most groups under 5\\" at 500 yards. However, due to the POLITICS in my department I was never able to get onto the SWAT Team.<br /><br />Seal Training Overview:<br />There are other books about the Navy Seal Team training and how difficult it is, such as 'The Warrior Elite'. Which many say is the BEST book to read if you are considering becoming a Navy Seal yourself. But some complained that, that book was too technical and chronological. However, this book, 'Lone Survivor' also gives us a very good overview of Navy Seal training, for those who would like an overview but who are not considering becoming a Seal themselves.<br /><br />I have not read 'The Warrior Elite' but I find it interesting that the subtitle to that book is, 'The Forging of SEAL Class 228', the same class that Luttrell graduated with. Luttrell started with class 226 but after breaking his leg had to come back later and completed his training with 'Class 228'. Maybe that is why the reviewer I mentioned above had some problems about whether it was 226 or 228?<br /><br />SO IF you want an awesome read, as good as any movie, READ THIS BOOK. It may be even better than the new movie 'Act of Valor' because the book is true. The movie 'Act of Valor' was based on, and played by real Navy Seals but the story itself was not true.<br /><br />I do NOT like fiction but I do agree with the old saying, \\"Life is stranger than fiction\\". That is why some true stories make the best movies.  I would say, \\"Life is more exciting than fiction too\\". I know because I could write a book about my own personal exploits as a police officer, in the San Francisco East Bay Area, with the riots of the 60's, and run-ins with Hell's Angels and with the Black Panthers in the 70's and 80's.<br /><br />I do have a question for you real SF GUYS. What do you think about the fact that Luttrell's Team returned to the SAME PLACE, that the goat herders had originally made contact with them??<br /><br />I know this is playing Monday quarterback but I can't help thinking about it? Personally if I had been there, I would have made a BIG STINK about NOT returning to the EXACT SAME SPOT! Even though it was the ONLY good place that they had found (so far), in which to recon the area that they were assigned? I would have done everything to find a different. I know that the same thing may have happened any way thought.<br /><br />Also I understand that in the heat of the situation, it may be hard to consider ALL options, but hey these guys ARE the simply THE BEST. The best-trained, and the best and fastest thinkers on their feet. Being a police officer I understand that too often we have to make very QUICK decisions, and often lives depend on our decisions...
B006ZNRD06|1.0|I spent time trying to get this to work, but on every video I tried the the audio and video were badly out of sync to the point of being unwatchable.  I ran a test with a small mp4 which played perfectly in the built in movies app but showed audio sync issues VPlayer so it's definitely the app.  I haven't been able to find any settings that could fix the issue, so I think on the Kindle Fire it's essentially unusuable.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|John Scalzi, in my opinion writes some of the most creative Sci-fi available today.  A fresh take on what our future may be like. Intriguing and poignant, sometimes harsh and even brutal, there's something in his works for everyone who enjoys Science Fiction.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Don't know why people are complaining saying it doesn't work on the Fire. I purchased, installed, and played thru all the levels yesterday with no problem. as tod there not being a free, ad based version, those suck up your battery. I'd rather pay and have it run smoothly and not suck the life out of my battery. $3 is a good price and well worth it. hoping new levels come soon. The current levels are challenging but not too frustrating.
006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium was a book I didn't think I'd read. It continues the story of Lena, who is now working for the resistance after learning how to survive in the Wilds. I find that unless the first instalment is an instant favourite, I'd usually rather imagine an ending to the story myself and move on to new characters than spend three+ years following a series that may head in a direction that aggravates me. I'm having a similar problem with the Matched series - I enjoyed the first book, but Crossed has remained half-read.<br /><br />The thing is, I'm a serious Lauren Oliver fan. Before I Fall was stunning, Delirium captivated me, and I've heard great things about Liesl and Po. However, I am not a fan of love-triangles, insta-love or cliff-hanger endings - and I had it on good authority that this book was the full trifecta.<br /><br />I read it anyway - and I'm glad I did, because Pandemonium is in many ways an ever better book than its predecessor.<br /><br />What I Loved:<br />Pandemonium has the same fantastic writing you can expect from Oliver, but a different structure than book one. It alternates chapters between `then' and `now'. The two stories run parallel so you see Lena adjusting to life in the wilds in the `then' chapters and see her working for the resistance and kicking ass in the `now' chapters.<br /><br />What Was Lacking:<br />As I've said, Cliff-hangers make me grumpy and this one is a doozie. I can haz Requiem now?<br /><br />Quote:<br />\\"That is what hatred is. It will feed you and at the same time turn you to rot.<br />It is hard and deep and angular, a system of blockades. It is everything and total.<br />Hatred is a high tower. In the Wilds, I start to build, and to climb.\\"

B002E0JL4A|5.0|Great movie and it's even better that it is a true story. Working in medicine and seeing how one person can make a difference in healthcare treatment is wonderful.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Ok, this is a rip-off of a rip-off...and chances are, you may have already read or watched this movie/book already.<br /><br />In 1982, Stephen King, aka Richard Bachman wrote 'The Running Man', which was turned into 'The Running Man' movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1987. Only difference is that this story changes 'convicts' into 'selected teenagers'...same plot, same action, same wrong-turned-right intent.<br /><br />If that isn't enough, there was a Japanese story called 'Battle Royale', which was first published before 2000, with english translation in 2003 (2nd ed was 2009), with additional sequels afterward. The movie was released originally in 2000 in Japan...and is not only a better more-believable story than 'The Hunger Games', but is IDENTICAL in story and intent...THE HUNGER GAMES is a massive work of plagerism!  If you don't like plagerism, if you think copying another's work is wrong, if you believe in copyright and original artist's rights...you would boycott this book and movie...see the original works, instead...they are BETTER.
0896898288|3.0|I love the concept, enjoyed reading the letters. The patterns are awesome, but the actual templates leave a lot to be desired. The templates print out one per page for 106 pages. The pattern shown in the book are not to 6x6 scale, so you can't just use freezer paper like you can in the Dear Jane book. No dimensions are given for the templates either. If those things were done, you'd take an ok book and make it a great book,IMHO. Still, thought it was worth the purchase price. I found most of the blocks in my Blockbase, so I'll be printing them out from there.
1401937519|5.0|This book opened my eyes and my heart. Anita Moorjani taught me that I am loved just as I am and the concept of time is an illusion. The power of our mind in healing is unbelievable!

0439023521|4.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />Just as with Twilight, I finally succumbed to hype and picked up the first book in the trilogy. It seems as if God and everybody has read it, so I didn't want to be on the sidelines of this big, cultural thing. And I have to say it: I wish I'd thought of the premise.<br /><br />It's set in the distant future, where North America is in tatters from war and mismanagement. 'The Capitol,' an area in the Rocky Mountains, controls the 'districts.' There are 12, with the 13th destroyed when all the districts rose up and tried to wrest control from the Capitol. Now, as punishment, children add their names to 'the lottery', where one girl and one boy will be chosen at random, once a year, to compete in the games, which are televised.<br /><br />of course there's lots of detail and heartache. And the premise is so compelling you have to keep reading once you start. But...if you're an author (as I am) you'll cringe, and not once, but multiple times. I pulled a muscle in my neck yesterday.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins writes. Like this. In really short. Stocky sentences. With 'she ran as if her life depended on it' and 'sparkled like fireflies' cliches thrown in. For good measure. There isn't one bit of prose. None. Just short sentences. Like this.<br /><br />I'm taking my daughter to the opening tomorrow, so I'm trying to get through it, and I'm looking forward to the ending, and finding out what lurks for these kids who are forced into such a gritty situation. But I never thought I'd read something so popular that was written worse than 'Twilight,' another sub-standard set of books with a premise that's through the roof, but one I really love.<br /><br />So, I've given it four stars, for the fact that she even thought up the idea. I took away one star for the lousy writing, most of which should have been picked up by her editor.

0439023521|5.0|I read The Hunger Games in two days.  It was a blast of a read.  I'm no teenager, and not a female, but I really connected and empathized with Katniss, the main character.  This book is a lot of fun to read.  Just don't read it before going to bed.  You'll be awake all night reading.
1400069181|5.0|\\"Start Something That Matters\\" by Blake Mycoskie is an awesome and inspirational read.  This book tells the compelling story of how the shoes called TOMS came to be.  The author was destined to succeed in business, but even if he had not blown up with the shoes...I get the impression that he would have been okay because he lived well, laughed often, loved much, and gave the best of himself to others freely.<br /><br />The book includes copies of the hand sketch of the shoes, personal handwritten notes, and various photos that document the journey to TOMS becoming a reality.  If the table of contents can provide a heads up to this awesome book...I will share it:  find your story, face your fears, be resourceful without resources, keep it simple, build trust, giving is good business, the final step.  The author states that his goal with this book is not about sells, but about inspiration.  I don't think anyone who reads it, will walk away uninspired to the 10th power.
0425238091|5.0|This is the classic medical novel which is considered \\"required reading\\" for anyone who wants to be a doctor.  It's a very interesting, but sometimes disturbing read.  As a doctor, I don't find that there is nearly as much sex in the hospital as House of God lets on, but maybe it's just that I'm not involved in it!  Overall, a must-read for anyone in the medical profession.<br />Sanjay Gupta's recent book [[ASIN:0446583855 Monday Mornings: A Novel]] is a good companion to House of God from a medical fiction standpoint.  These are the two medical novels I recommend to medical students and premeds.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love Angry Birds Space.  I love the addition of the gravity and no gravity parts.  To those of you complaining that it costs, come on now - its cheap and you got the others free and it is well worth the money and I bought the HD Kindle Fire edition.  It is a great game. To the reviewer about the purple birds going backwards, took me a few minutes to figure it out too. They will go to the spot you touch, unlike the yellow birds. Hope that helps.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|very well done, has a nice hint option to provide a push if needed.  looking forward to more games of this nature.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is super fun I think its the best version out of All of the angry birds all tho there is only 2 worlds but its worth the 3 Dollers
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I really liked the concept of this movie. It isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but I really enjoy watching something that doesn't stick to the normal conformity, and this movie has some pretty cool scenes too! I would rate this movie 9/10, but I just get 4 or 5 stars and this movie deserves more then 4. If you're looking for something different and abstract, I would definately suggest at least renting it.
B00005JL78|1.0|The quality of the film is bad: grainy, blurry; and the color is pale blue (as the image on the cover of the case)!!!  Its quality is the same as that of video clips downloaded from free websites.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|worked great on my LG optimus. nice game. very addicting. doesn't work on my LG esteem though; starts up and shuts off.<br /><br />Update: 5/17/12 ---ok, so this game is cr*p! not only does it not work on my new phone but it has stopped working on my ASUS Eee tablet. and mind you, I payed for this game. apparently it only works for the first month or two and then stops working. don't waste your money on the online download. if you wanna play it, buy the cd I guess, althogh it's not really worth more then $5 cause the game is so short. Look for a different game.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love PvZ on the PC but this Android version freezes ever time on my Galaxy Nexus. I was able to get to level 1-3 but cannot complete it due to consistent freezing like 40% into the level. Fix it, PopCap! &gt;=(

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book really bring the character emotion to the reader . As I was reading this I really felt like I was in the story. This is one of the best book I read. This story well have you drawn to it for days.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I tried this app because I love watching the stars. I sit out and watch a lot of evenings. The instructions say all you have to do is point your unit at the star and it will produce a picture of what you are looking at. Well late in the instructions it says it works of the GPS of the unit. Kindle Fire does not have GPS so it doesn't work on the Fire.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|Loved this book despite its bad press.  I tried to not judge it based on the reviews, and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a story of a Mom who, like most moms, is trying to do what is best for her kids.  The story is about love, conrol, and utimately the experience of knowing when kids must shape and take control of their own lives.  This is one of the hardest struggles as a mom.  I dont agree with all she say and does in her parenting style, but I have used several ideas to show my children how to expect more of themselves.  I think all good mothers have a little \\"tiger\\" in them.
1401322425|5.0|The program \\"Jamie at Home\\" is one of my favorite cooking shows. I had hoped this book would contain one or two of my favorite recipes. Instead it's like reading every episode of his show. Could not be happier. Can't wait to try almost each and every recipe! An excellent purchase, a must have in my cookbook library!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I love this game. It's pure logic, and you can keep trying as many times as it takes to win each level. the little blocks smile when you get it right. cute.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is such a godsend for us.  We play MANY word games and words that are in question are understood right here swiftly.  We also have a game that we play on our Kindle which tells us the words we missed.  If there are words we never saw before we can define those words and thereby expand our vocabulary!!!  AWESOME!

B000JK8OYU|5.0|For me, the value of this CD is found in the memories from my teenage years that it brings to the surface. I find myself drifting back to when the original mono versions of the singles and albums were first released on vinyl. I enjoy listening to the mixes that feature the harmonies and instrument combinations that were not nearly as prominent or \\"isolated\\" on the original master recordings. Thanks for the memories.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is probably one of the best out there! There are music videos on youtube so you can just download any song you want for free. On my Kindle Fire there is a gallery and all the videos you get from this AMAZING app just go there. I bet if you have any other device it will probably go to your &quot;music&quot; folder or &quot;video&quot; folder. BEST APP EVER YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT!!!

B0059XTUB8|5.0|It's a great insight on the tragic life of Marilyn Monroe.  It really shows how things were set up to where people only saw what they wanted people to see so often. A stunning beauty with a dose of magic in every shot taken of her but on the inside she had a problem with men and depression which came with pills, all which i believe led to her death at such an untimely age. Michelle Williams doesnt particurly look like her, no, but shes such a great actress.  Despite physical differences I think she was perfect for the part.  Eddie Redmayne is just green enough to where he is convincing as Colin. Its a beautiful movie, well acted.

Also it was very difficult to understand what they are saying. I love Guy Richy's other movies (lock stock, and snatch) so I could barley wait for rocknrolla to come in the mail only to find in my opinion it sucks! If your thinking about buying this movie, i would rent it first.

B00062PN6I|5.0|So far so good. I have been using these since I bought them(6 months ago), almost daily. I can wear them for 6+ hours and they are comfortable. Light weight so they don't give me a headache from wearing them too long.  Ears get a bit hot/sweaty but that is normal for these type headphones.  Maybe someone should come up with an exhaust fan for headsets. Anyways great sound quality for the $$.  I don't throw my headsets anymore so I can't vouch for the durability if they are treated this way. Doubt they'd hold up if abused as they are pretty lightweight. Wire doesnt seem real strong but again I just use them and set them down so not an issue for me. I recommend buying these, they were a great price when I got mine.

0375869026|5.0|In the words of one reviewer, \\"Can I just say right now that I loved Wonder by R.J. Palacio? I want EVERYONE to read it. (That's right, I shouted!) In fact, if it were out right now I'd be buying copies to give to other people to read. I loved it, it was so sweet and real. It's sad, funny, inspiring, infuriating, eye opening and awesome. I'd like to think that it wouldn't have been me that would have reacted to seeing Auggie for the first time, but I know I'd be lying.\\"

B005LAJ23A|5.0|When former showrunner Frank Darabont \\"left\\" THE WALKING DEAD before the start of the second season, I was extremely worried for its future. It seemed to be going in a very positive direction after only a few episodes in its first season, and much of that seemed to be Darabont's passion for the project as well as creator Robert Kirkman's desire to not slavishly adhere to his own source material. That was a surprising high point for the first season, since the comic itself is so amazingly good, and has several fans, that he would be more than willing to depart from his own material in order to keep audiences on their toes.<br /><br />It was even rumored that a major cast member was ready to walk off set since Darabont's leaving, but who it was was never confirmed, and it certainly didn't happen.<br /><br />But when the show came back for its first episode of the second season, it made a point of adhering to certain major plot points of the comic while keeping the relationships and characters fresh, and with Glen Mazzara as the new showrunner, it seemed like the show was going to keep going along with all of the forward momentum it had gained from the previous season. However, I had some concerns about the bonafides of Mazzara. He had been an Exec Producer on several disappointing TV series, like \\"Life\\", \\"Crash\\" and \\"HawthoRNe\\", but he was also an exec on one of the best cop shows ever, \\"The Shield\\". So, with any work on \\"The Shield\\" cancelling any of the poorer parts of his career out, it was looking like smooth scary sailing for this season.<br /><br />Now, it's worth pointing out that THE WALKING DEAD has easily become the most contentious piece of genre television since SyFy's reboot of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. If you look at the internet after an episode, it's aflutter with conversations proclaiming it either one of the worst shows ever or one of the best shows ever. It's also worth mentioning that neither side is right. When an episode of TWD is good, it ranks amongst some of the very best TV has to offer. Episodes like \\"Chupacabra\\" where Daryl is stranded in the wilderness, \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\" when the group opens the barn, and \\"Better Angels\\" as Shane enacts some of his solutions to some of his problems are some of the best episodes of TV in recent memory. But further more, there is another group of viewers that sound off even more frequently than either other group: The \\"I'm Watching Because I Want It To Get Better\\" group. This is the group with the most complaints, and in my opinion, the ones with the most validity to their claims. They want the show to have tighter writing. They want the characters not to be glossed over. They don't want too many 'Red Shirts' on the show (referring of course to the old \\"Star Trek\\" and how the nameless characters existed merely to get killed in an episode). They want the show to keep moving. There are moments that I agree with all of these statements, but I'm seeing what the show is doing (or trying to do) and am much more willing to forgive the show's occasional plot hole or deus ex machina or the \\"This Character is About to Do Something REALLY Stupid\\" moments in favor of the work being done by the cast, crew and creative staff.<br /><br />However, it's far from perfect when plot and characters start to get bogged down from over-expository moments to a particular episode. Characters like Lori, Dale, Carol and ESPECIALLY T-Dog are essentially lost in the character arc shuffle despite the major things happen (Carol and Sophia, Lori and The Surprise, Dale and his staunch sense of humanity, and T-Dog and his... well... he did have that arm injury... yes, I'm essentially calling T-Dog a useless character bordering on being the \\"Token Black Stereotype\\"). However, when there are moments of their arcs moving forward, they do so with tremendous momentum.<br /><br />But even with Rick struggling to lead the group as a paragon of virtue, Andrea overcoming her personal demons and becoming a strong element to the group's assault force, Carl spending formative moments in the midst of far too many moral grey areas for a child to have to experience, the new character of Herschel and his staunch religious and moral beliefs and then having those beliefs shattered, and Glenn and his discovery of his more masculine side with the help of new character Maggie... this season belonged to one character: Shane. If there is a character that we can identify with the most AND the least, it's Shane. Here's a man willing to do anything to keep himself safe as well as the woman and child he loves. He also is willing to commit to an almost morally bankrupt existence so that he can do those things. Jon Bernthal proves to be the most versatile cast member for this season, and his arc is the most compelling. If Bernthal doesn't get an Emmy nod for his work on this season, it honestly won't make sense.<br /><br />Speaking of the cast, there are several who shine: Jeffrey DeMunn as the ever-watchful ever-wise Dale, Laurie Holden as the struggling-to-find-her-place Andrea, Steven Yeun as the occasionally-wisecracking and romantically-challenged Glenn, Andrew Lincoln as the constantly-conflicted Rick, but the other two strongest performances besides Bernthal are Scott Wilson as Herschel and Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon. Sadly, the weakest link to the cast is Sarah Wayne Callies as Lori. She didn't impress during her run on the show PRISON BREAK, and just seems too far out of her depth since most of her scenes are with other, better performances. Also sad are the criticisms of Chandler Riggs playing young Carl. He's actually not out of his depth here, and his character is that of a young boy who is trying to maintain some of his youthful nature despite the omnipresent death that looms around him in either physical or metaphysical form. He's reckless, impatient, irresponsible, and sometimes flat-out dumb. But surprisingly, most kids that age are like that, and I don't think that the character or the young actor deserves the criticism he gets.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the effects work on the show is flawless. Greg Nicotero, who also transitioned into directing during this season, has supervised all the VFX and makeup and has done so with an expert eye for detail, even if some of that detail is EXTREMELY gory. Other directors like Ernest Dickerson, who's directed several episodes of this show, as well as many other shows such as BURN NOTICE, DEXTER, TREME, and most especially THE WIRE (not arguably the greatest cop show ever to hit television), shows a great eye for striking visuals as well as being a very good actor's director, which was especially proven in his direction of the season finale, \\"Beside The Dying Fire\\". Other strong creative forces kept proving themselves time and again this season, such as writer/co-producer Evan Reilly, who came from another favorite show of mine, RESCUE ME, and Kirkman himself who did his share of heavy lifting in the writing and exec producing this season, despite being the writer of at least three monthly comic books as well.<br /><br />The only problem I have with the show consistently is the same problem I have with all action or genre-oriented entertainment: The unerring shootist or unlimited ammo UNLESS the moment requires them to run out of ammo, or miss to create tension or suspense. You see, characters walk around this show like Wild Bill Hickok in a John Woo film. Sure, there were moments when Shane and Rick taught the members of the group how to shoot, but BELIEVE ME, you still can't shoot a zombie in the head hanging out of a moving car no matter how many months you might have been practicing, and you can't fire 20-odd rounds of a 7-round shotgun. The only time the people miss or run out of ammo is when the story requires it, like reloading with a Walker creeping up behind you, or just grazing the skull of a fellow group member when if it had been a Walker, it would be a completely perfect headshot.<br /><br />The most common complaint I hear about this show is the lack of Walkers. That is one of those complaints that I dismiss entirely out of hand. You want constant zombie presence and constant zombie killing, watch the RESIDENT EVIL films. THE WALKING DEAD is not just a zombie show, much in the same way that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA wasn't just a space-battle show. The characters have to interact and grow, especially in an environment such as this where society no longer exists other than in their own memories. Morality is something that appears to be the relic of a bygone era, and this is a land that seems to be ruled strictly by Darwinian principles. Concepts of good and evil have become luxuries, and the new law is survival. Some members of this group believe that very strongly, and some are shouting to the heavens that there must be a better way to live other than just survival. The argument could honestly be made either way, and more often than not, those are the moments when the show can either be at its best or it can wither away any momentum it had. The show is already great, but finding a balance between words and deeds will be how the show will live or die, but there are far too many smart and talented people behind this program for that to happen. The show has only had 19 episodes. Young shows will have growing pains, but when I rewatched the season finale, there were too many things that showed even more promise for the new season.character or the young actor deserves the criticism he gets.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the effects work on the show is flawless.

B00026WU7I|5.0|There are recording that are in a world of their own. This is one of them I own this in SACD and recently bought a new CD to replace an aged old one. Some music stands apart for me, I put this in  COLLECTION with \\"Joshua Tree\\" U2, \\"Kind of Blue\\" Miles Davis and \\"West\\" Lucinda Williams. I will stop at this point other than to say some stuff shakes me up. To Dylan fans I was camped behind the bandstand at Newport and the private Sunday morning concert of Dylan's going electric, was one of the best I have ever heard him. In parting if you have not listened to your music on SACD, do check into it, APO is turning out some great stuff in SACD, as LSO has in Classical.

0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is an excellent courtroom drama and murder mystery. The details of the court case will totally capture your interest, and at times you will believe the characters are real and want to scream at the lawyers because of the way they manipulate the facts, witnesses and the jury.<br />How far would a parent go to protect a child accused of murder? Would parents actually suspect their own child? Could they believe their child was capable of such an act? Would friends remain loyal after such an accusation? How does a family survive the isolation and humiliation of the trial and all it encompasses?<br />Anyone who reads this book will be left with the thought, what would I have done, how would I cope in each of the situations, with my friends if their child was accused, with my son and my spouse if my child were accused? Could I hold up under such embarrassing scrutiny and stress?<br />This story takes place in Newton, a bedroom community of Boston. It begins in a Grand Jury courtroom as Mr. Andrew Barber, a former District Attorney, is on the stand being examined by a fellow lawyer regarding his son's murder charge. It then seems to proceed backwards in time, to the trial of his son, Jacob, for the murder of a teenage bully, Ben Rifkin. Throughout the novel, interspersed with the dialogue, there are vignettes from the Grand Jury hearing to fill in missing pieces of the story. You are there with the accused and almost feel like a jury member yourself, listening to the facts as they are told, wondering about Jacob's guilt or innocence, judging the performances of the lawyers and the innuendos about the accused.<br />Jacob might be described as a sullen boy, not social, a geek, emotionally immature, outside the social strata of the mainstream high school student. His reactions are not quite right, not what one would expect, in certain circumstances. When he is implicated in the murder of a fellow student, the story explodes into the public eye. His innocence is never really a factor; his guilt is all anyone ever envisions. Jacob's demeanor makes people believe he could have done it, and circumstantial evidence points in his direction. All the details of his and his family's life are examined and made public.<br />Did the investigators properly investigate the case, looking for all suspects, or did they simply aim at Jacob, disregarding other evidence in order to solve the crime expeditiously because of its horrific nature? He is emotionally immature. His ancestors have committed crimes of horrific violence. Is there, therefore, a murder gene or a propensity to commit violent crimes?<br />Friends can make incriminating statements about the accused that would seem innocent in other circumstances. The problem of putting anything on the internet, which becomes public as soon as you are under suspicion, is really illuminated. There is no place to hide if you have implicated yourself on any of the public social sites. Any stupid thing you may have done will cast suspicion upon you because if you are the accused, the benefit of the doubt seems to disappear and is given to your accuser. Every thing you do will be examined six ways to Sunday in the media, by those looking to make a headline and a name for themselves; what happens to you and your family, in the event of your innocence, is immaterial to them. You and your family will be tormented and no one will care. The Barbers had been respected members of the community, yet they fell from grace immediately.<br />The novel shows how easy it is for the prosecutor and the defense attorney to skew the evidence in their favor. The court system and investigatory methods are subject to so much corruption. Evidence that might help the defendant is hidden, just to prove a point and win the case, even when that evidence might shed light on the truth. Winning is the main goal.<br />This novel expertly examines the dynamic of family interaction, social relationships, marriage, genetic background, the psychology of motive and crime, the influence of circumstantial evidence, the damage an inference can cause, the playacting and manipulation on the part of lawyers, and it exposes the strain a tragic event puts on love and friendship.<br />The author has fully developed his characters, exposing their flaws and their strengths. He exposes the corruption in our legal system: the dog eat dog world of the DA's office, the motivation of politics which further corrupts the system, the danger of a media out of control, the difficulty of determining the truth. The novel feels so true to life that you can imagine it really happening. The ending, is totally unexpected so don't peek!

1451683405|5.0|A wonderful book that advances the counter-intuitive idea that free will is an illusion. This book will garner some negative opinions because it contradicts humanity's common sense view that each person is a completely free agent.  And nowhere on Earth is this view held more sacred than in the United States with its history of rugged individualism and personal responsibility.  This makes Sam Harris' *Free Will* all the more important.<br /><br />At less than 100 pages it seems a bit silly to refer to *Free Will* as an enormously important read, but it wouldn't be silly in the slightest to say so.  *Free Will* explains why we think we have free will and why that conception of our agency is wrong.  I can think of nothing more central to the way we live our lives than this mistaken belief.  Fortunately, changing our understanding of free will wouldn't change the way we live our lives except in important subtle ways, and Harris explains this in his book as well.<br /><br />I would also recommended reading Malcolm Gladwell's *Outliers*, which brings Harris' argument to life with deftly told stories that amuse as much as they inform.

It has the same poor quality as \\"Murder in 3 Acts\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\" (the first and second, respectively, worst movies ever made): not only is it egregiously violent, its pretence to portraying any valid mythology is mythical itself.  In the movie, I saw props and costumes more suited for ancient Rome than ancient Greece: did the director even ever open a PRIMER of ancient history???.  Nor could I trace even one single incident to honest Greek mythology.  The entire raison d'etre of the movie seems to be brutality, blood and violence--history and true Greek mythology be damned.  I wouldn't let my dog watch this almost-worst of films.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|this game is not worth 3$!!! sure it has new stuff and all but it is definitely not worth 3$!!!! I definitely do not recommend it

B007FDE4Y8|4.0|I wanted a good stabilizer to use with my HDSLR, and was about to pull the trigger on a used Merlin for 3x the price of a new Steadyvid pro.  This is much better built than the previous steadyvid, all parts being metal and I like the fact that it is collapsable.  It WILL take some time to get used to adjusting the perfect balance, but watch some merlin videos on youtube as others have stated and it will be fine.  I didn't give it 5 stars since there's so little instructions from the manufacturer for use, but like I said, youtube is the only manual you'll need.
1934030198|4.0|Buy it if you are a serious triathlete or high level of interest to become a triathlete. Truly a \\"training bible\\"
B00008J2PG|4.0|Excellent story of heroism, along the lines of Schindler's list. It may not have had as much hype as SL but as memories of WWII fade with the passing years, this film reminds us of the multiple acts of bravery performed by so many \\"average\\" people during that time. A brave Irish priest led the activities to shelter thousands of refugees during the German occupation. However, many local Italians and ex-patriates also risked their lives - all because they believed in human freedom and helping their fellow man. This film also presents the politics that involved the Papacy. Pope Pius XII has gotten so much flack for not being more \\"anti-Nazi\\". Sir John Gielgud did a phenomenal job in depicting the neutrality that had to be presented publicly while allowing aid to be done under his own roof. During our current era, when greed and violence seem to dominate, this film is a refreshing reminder that each of us can be heroic. A final unexpected twist and the epilogue show the extent of Fr. O'Flaherty's unflagging compassion toward his fellow man and serves as an example for all of us.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a great product, but could use a little tweaking.  The only shortcoming is that it doesn't always stand up which was a feature I wanted.<br />The edge doesn't fit firmly in the groove provided.  Seems to be durable and looks okay.  I would have liked a better color selection--graphite is boring!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and great game to play while you are bored at home or anywhere you are.  many different games to play.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|I had the DVD versions, but wanted it for my Blu-ray collection. Good remastering and worthy add to one's collection.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|In \\"The Hunger Games\\" Suzanne Collins conjures a three-dimensional reading experience. It's akin to cinerama--the wrap-around theatrical movie screen that made film audiences feel like they were inside the movie, although this author goes a few steps further, with feelorama, smellorama and tasteorama. This is an incredible display of literary brilliance, not in the story of heroine Katniss but in the way the author tells what is basically a flawed story. Flawed because the author assumes that I, and presumably other readers, will readily believe the idea that parents in this fictional Panem, born out of the ashes of North America,  simply surrender their kids to the state without a protest, allowing their children to be taken to a sports killing arena where 95% will die. We are expected to believe that the television audience watching these deadly games (it's mandatory viewing: parents, brothers, sisters, cousins, neighbors and town folk) are mindless bloodthirsty drones who get bored unless they can see action, unless they can see a kid spearing another kid--forget shame, remorse, or conflict for betting on who's going to die and who's going to prevail.  If you think I didn't like the book because of that you're wrong. I took a huge leap of faith, pretended they were all hypnotized, and decided that the author's skill with imagery and the richness of her prose was reason enough to love it. If you can cast aside the credibility issue, it's riveting.  Almost the best novel I've read in years.
1878424319|5.0|this is an awesome book, with the agreements being a cornerstone for improved peace and attitude in life. If you have religious beliefs the agreements are probably in sync with those and are simple guidelines to help remember some very important behaviors. I strongly recommend this book and have shared it with many friends.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Don't know about this in 2D, but in 3D, it's a treat.<br />And don't know if 3D can improve any movie but again, it did with this!<br />A subterranean kaleidoscope of colors.<br />Back dropped with lust rainforest & vast oceans.<br />Ambient birds, big toothed flying fish, giant mushrooms, man eating plants.<br />And prehistoric wildlife is just a few in this delightful mix?<br />And O' Yeah! Don't forget a few amusement park rides, as well.  That would have killed any of us, but remember its Hollywood.<br />In 3D it's worth the price of admission. ~ HAVE A GREAT DAY ~ from the ...<br />*Lone Star State .......
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Excellent product and fast delivery . I have watched Friends with Benefits 3 times already . It's entertaining and funny.  Excellent cast . Highly recommended.
0985081821|5.0|This book was given to me by the author herself, and I'm really happy she did so. This book was way different than anything I have ever read and I never waited for twists like this to happen. I will be completely honest with this book and to you. The plot is very original, yet there are vampires although not the kind you expect. Wicca magic is in the book and I never have read about it before, so that was something completely new to me. Sophia, the main character was a dynamic girl that just needed a little push to believe in herself, I really enjoyed her and I would love to read more about her. Charles, her way too HOT boyfriend is delicious and very courageous, I love him<3. Adrian is a really trustworthy friend and I enjoyed him, as well. The other characters are very well created and have been into thought into the book. I do not want to spoil the book anymore than I already have but I will say this. The book creates a dark, gloomy setting that will have readers read more and more, the story jumps right into the plot and its great! I would have liked a lit bit more action although the twists made it very good! I highly recommend it and I'm really grateful for the opportunity I was given:D I cant wait to read the next in the series!<3 My rating for this book is 5 out of 5 stars.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|fun fun I liked it a lot! It had great scenes too! please make more hidden object games. thanks a lot!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun missile game, no issues.  Level upsadd to the strategy a bit to make it more playable.  Good touch screen game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Last night I picked up the first Wool because it was cheap and had good reviews. The people and the world were so vivid, and the ending of the first book so odd, that I couldn't stand not knowing what came next.  I immediately bought the Omnibus Wool 1 - 5.  And I've stayed up 'till almost 3 in the morning to finish the rest of the story.  It pulled me in and wouldn't let go.  That is a finely crafted tale.  I can't wait to read more from this author.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I had Higher hopes for this book. I enjoyed reading it because it was different than anything else I've read before.  The disappointment  comes because  I was underwhelmed maybe because I was expecting more  surprises.  I would have liked it more if it had more excitement. When I had finished the read I could recall only one heart stopping moment.  The story was simply told and done.  I can't say more without a spoiler alert!  I liked it  or I  would not have bothered to read to the end.  It is a colorful story of magic and a subdued story of love.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I listened to this a an audio download from my local library. Just when you think the story is over  the author throws in another twist which for me made it just a little bit too long but I enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|addicting...... i just couldnt put the book down. its probably one of the best books ive ever read and ive read some pretty  good books in my lifetime.  i cant wait to read the next one! you should read this book. youll enjoy it.  i love the hunger games
B007BVOF8E|3.0|The actors, characters and prim-is of the story is good. (I am a fan of Gary Oldman.) However it was not easy for me to stay interested. Not so much because the story was slow. But because it was jumbled with the time-line and flashbacks out of context, making it not easy for me to piece all the scenes together into a consistent story. There were parts i didn't follow well, as to what the scene was about, or how it related to the over all story. It almost felt as if the characters in the story knew what they were talking about, however the story forgot to clue-in the viewers with enough detail or back story to feel part of the conversation.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i think breaking dawn is my favorite book out of this series. i was reading the first few reviewand i completely disagree with the people who said breaking dawn was horrible or the worsy book ever. its a wonderful book with a twisted ending for this series. i wont say what happened for i dont want to spoil it for all the people who havent read breaking dawn and are reading this. i think stephanie meyers is wonderful writer. i love the twilight series.
1586487981|5.0|I first read this book during a course in Microfinance and was quite impressed and fascinated by all the insights the book offers. The authors describe the living conditions of the poor in a sensitive and detailed way, while always making comparisons with our living standards and responsibilities in high developed countries. The book is written with such humanity, dignity and insight that make it difficult to stop reading once you started diving into the chapters. The authors also created a website which provides complementary material on all the chapters and additional up-to date insights and research on global poverty. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in development issues.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was supposed to be reading review books. But after finding this book for Roberto I asked myself what problem would it cause if I just read a few pages of this one. I wanted to find out why Roberto wanted to read it. Well, that was a mistake and a half. Not only did I not want to read any review books, I didn't want to work. I seriously considered not going to sleep. My phone and iPad were monopolized by this book. I drained both batteries trying to get through it in the shortest amount of time possible. While guilt filled me for neglecting the other ebooks.<br /><br />John Green's book was brilliant. Sad, yet so full of life. Cancer has affected everyone I know. They all have a tale or two, some more tragic than others. I have been blessed thus far by not having known personally a youngster who has had to battle cancer. After reading this novel, I'm wondering if I can still classify myself as being blessed? The teens John wrote about had so much insight into life. They were intelligent, serious, fun-loving and could teach anyone about how to live. Their love for each other and the world around them was contagious.<br /><br />What can I say? I laughed. I cried. And I cried some more. This was one of the best books I've ever read. John Green has perfectly voiced a sixteen-year-old girl who is fumbling through the first love of her life. If I knew Augustus when I was 16, I would have fallen in love with him too. This is a must read for everybody. Just make sure you have some Kleenex in your pocket. You're going to need it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is different than all the other mahjong games. Visually and how to play it. Its my favorite. Sure worth the download.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|The E6 worked great for almost three weeks.  Then it no longer turned on and would not take a charge.  I sent it back for full refund which was issued in about 5 days.  I am seriously thinking about buying another one because it made my android sound brilliant.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game! It is so additive. I do not have enough time to play it the way I would like to.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I had high hopes of this adaptation, but sadly this version adds nothing to the original. The lead actors did a great job but the film overall lacked the visceral intensity of the original. The Swedish version is still the way to go - skip this one unless you don't really care.
B002R5QPRI|1.0|I still have not received this product, so how can i rate it? I will be happy once i get it.
B001R0XNSI|5.0|Don't hardly notice this hotdog sized pen in your pocket. It slides right in and is slick enough to not get caught on anything. Not too bad to open, would have liked to seen one with a snap cap but I understand why that would deminish its weapon abilities. I like it.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun and intellectually stimulating! I would recommend it to any and everyone. I play it till I fall asleep.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|This one really makes you think.... it's deceptively difficult, but trying to figure out the secret to the tough levels is fun.<br /><br />*** I am deleting this app after becoming aware of how many different adware companies, etc...it uses.  I can live with one or two, but I counted at least 8 for this one. :-/ Even with allowing for analytics and stuff, that's excessive.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I got this game because I already had city story. I just thought it might be cool as well, and it sure was.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Recently I returned to reading sci-fi after a very long absence. I selected books by looking at Hugo award winner lists over the past several years and by using NPRs top 100 Sci-fi and fantasy list. Suffice it to say that I've read some really, really good books over the past couple of years. I picked up Wool Omnibus on a total whim, off of a Kindle recommended list. I saw all the five star reviews, and the cynical side of me thought there is no way this is legit. But since the price was right I figured I had nothing to lose.It did not take many pages for me to realize that I had landed on something special. I'm not going to say it's the best thing I've ever read, but it was good enough for me to write my first review ever. I can think of a few series that grabbed my interest just as quickly (A Song of Fire and Ice, Dune and Ender's Game come to mind), but this is one of the rare series that gets better with each installment and never seems to lag. I suspect that Wool 5 is not the end, though it could be as there certainly is some closure. If it isn't (please!), I can't wait to see where the story leads.My only regret is that I read all 5 in one shot. It would have been agonizing, but oh so satisfying, if I would have had to wait between editions!<br /><br />I truly believe that Mr Howey is going to be among the elite of his craft. Buy it and you might be the next 5 star reviewer!
B0063IH60K|4.0|nice game enjoy this nothing fancy but efficient smooth solitaire fun.  You cant go wrong with this app.  I have really enjoyed
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is already receiving enough reviews that there isn't much to be said. I really enjoyed it. Only complaint was that it seemed rushed at points, and the writing style was unfocused at times. Aside, it was so intriguing. Great story!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Ok. Seriously. Who would pay almost twice the amount of money for instant video with the price you can get it used.<br /><br />Do you understand your target audience? Nerds. We do math. I'm not going to pay 30 when I can get it for 15. Also, we tend to be accustomed to waiting. Waiting a lot. Instant gratification is like a foreign concept.<br /><br />Why are you charging double?<br /><br />P.S. The Big Bang Theory is one of the BEST shows ever.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This app is good at what it does.  It pretty much only views PDF files but the thing it beats the kindle reader out on is that it can open passward protected PDFs where the Kindle cannot (at least the Kindle Fire).  All in all it gets the job done and is a solid app, just not big and flashy like some people like.
B000AQBAUI|5.0|.....that sadly never quite got off the ground. I love \\"That 70's sound\\" and will take this type of vibe over many other types of sounds (especially most the stuff that tries to pass for rock now). If you're looking for an obscure 70's band to turn your friends onto and amaze them with your keen sense of music knowledge and make them think you're ultra-cool for listening to stuff like this, then this truly is the band for you! A little bit Zep-like in places, but never-the-less a nice find and it's really very cool that they've released this! If you like hard rock bands of the 70's like me, I can say positively that this is a must have to add to your collection!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|this game is so addicting to play.I love it so much its so entertaing to play!!!!! I would get it if I was you. and its free it gets better!

B00701897I|5.0|It is not often that I buy movies. I am more of a rent and watch once type of person. And when I do buy it is typically through iTunes. But when I saw the previews for this movie I knew I wanted to buy it on blu ray. I didn't rent it, I just purchased out right and I am so glad I did!<br /><br />This movie is gorgouse on my 46\\" 1080p Samsung TV. Parts of the movie are so well done you would think it was real!<br /><br />Now that I have seen it on pristine blu ray I am thrilled that I didn't get TinTin on iTunes. This is a movie that you need to see without all that compression on it.<br /><br />I grew up watching TinTin and thought that the movie stayed very true to the story. It was an absolute pleasure to watch.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Oh wow. Gorgeous game, fun and difficult clues, intuitive, and the perfect length.  Such an amazing step up from their first game release.  Love the 'seasons' theme and how the puzzles integrated with that.  Any reviewers who had issues with &quot;needing&quot; the hints or clues not being &quot;logical&quot; just weren't clever enough to figure them out.  The developers obviously have to make navigation like an adventure and put tricky clues in the game - it's what makes these games so fun, addictive, and challenging!  The nice thing about it is that you CAN'T just jump from screen to screen.  Thank god.  Hint complainers = lazy; don't listen to them if you like (and are good at) games like Myst, etc.  Easily in my top 3 games for the Kindle Fire.
B006CHML4I|4.0|This is a very good looking watch, medium size, works well for smaller hands. I like the blue, works very well for jeans. Even if I like the nylon strap I have a problem with it because when you sweat, wash your hands, etc. it will get dirty/moist and will get smelly after a while (it's a synthetic material after all). I'm considering buying a blue leather strap to complement it better. Having to wear it every other day is not so good but I knew that since I bought it. A little tricky to reset it once it's out for not moving more than 39 hours. I highly recommend it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|if you like this game you will like Doodle devil.it has no force close.Doodle God is a God an Doodle devil is a devil.you should buy this game its pustanding.great time waster.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle app on my phone and how easy it is to always carry a book with me.  The whisper sync function is awesome, since I use the app on my phone, TouchPad, laptop and even occasionally using the cloud reader, and every device knows exactly where I am in my book no matter which device I used last.  It is easy to shop and view my library.  Thanks to this app, I am reading more often and loving it.  I never thought I would like reading as much without the look and feel of paper books, but the versatility and portability of Kindle reading outweigh the benefits of paper, and I love that I can read in bed at night with the lights out.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is amazing fun yet addicting in a great way. I think u will like this game as much as I do.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|My experience is the same as others': on the Kindle Fire the video is jerky and the sound is out of sync with the video, making it basically unwatchable.  A big shame, because the controls are well-thought-out and, unlike two other players, it correctly renders the aspect ratios material that the other two players render with vertical stretching.

0060873027|5.0|As I write this review on March 24 2012, there are 30 x 5-star reviews vs. 81 x 1-star reviews. The number of negative reviews and the fairly low ratings averaging 2.5 stars out of 5 stars nearly convinced me to skip Michael Crichton's last novel. Nearly. I am so glad I decided to give it a chance as I enjoyed it as much as all his other novels with the exception of \\"Airframe\\". I had recently re-read \\"Jurassic Park\\" which I found as thrilling as the first time I read it many years ago. And I couldn't help comparing \\"Micro\\" to \\"Jurassic Park\\".<br />With 534 x 5-star reviews, \\"Jurassic Park\\" still managed to receive 17 x 1-star reviews which baffles me. Some of the critics are: no literary flair, hollow and pointless, poor character description, and so on. These are, of course, very similar to the critics of \\"Micro\\": poorly written, ridiculous, insipid, terrible dialogs, predictable...<br /><br />I haven't read all of Michael Crichton's books, not the earlier ones anyway, but it seems to me that Crichton liked to write stories that were fast paced (Jurassic Park, Prey, Timeline), set in an unusual setting, and that he had a particular penchant for technology with a science-fiction bend. No doubt, as with H.G. Wells, some of his predictions will come to pass. Anyway, if readers want character development, why read Crichton? Character development was never his forte. You might be better off reading \\"War and Peace\\" by Leo Tolstoy. Lots of action with excellent character development. Or Jane Austen. Another writer gifted at character development.<br />As for literary flair, I recommend \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee...<br />In \\"Micro\\", there are a few grad students working together, there is the required villain and his hapless assistant, each is introduced to the reader, we learn more about them as the book progresses, but it's really not the point. There was enough information to satisfy me and I can be as critical as the next person. The point of the book was the interaction of man and beast if you will... What happens when a civilized person is thrown in the middle of the wild confronted to the beast. The world is unforgiving, has no pity and no remorse. \\"Micro\\" was a twist on the nature of the wild. We don't think much of the micro world other than to lament at the pesky bugs in summertime.<br />Regarding credibility, nanotechnology was already previously explored by Crichton in \\"Prey\\" written a decade ago.<br /><br />I guess there was a lot of attitude towards this last endeavor by Crichton -because- it is suspected that he did not write it, or did not write much of it, and certainly did not finish it. What if he didn't? I was forewarned and wondered if I could work out which sections were Crichton's and which were Preston's. I couldn't tell. The style was in my humble opinion seamless, as was the direction of the story though I will admit one turn of event did surprise me.<br />I have only read one book by Richard Preston, The Cobra Event, and actually liked it, ghastly though it was. I suspect that if \\"Micro\\" had been published under Michael Crichton's name with no mention of Richard Preston, the book would have been another success.<br />\\"Micro\\" was certainly informative enough as were most of Crichton's books. I learned a great deal about the micro world and insects. Yes, I was reminded at some point of the family movie \\"Honey, I shrunk the kids\\", but the parallel quickly ended as what followed was far from cute and the micro world proved as unforgiving as the Amazon jungle would prove to anyone who happened to be dropped in the middle of it with nothing to help ensure survival.<br />Noone will be convinced by my review who has a mind set against \\"Micro\\". It still remains an entertaining, fast-paced, enjoyable, informative novel that unfortunately concludes Michael Crichton's literary career. Well done, Mr. Crichton, you will be greatly missed.
B004KZDV8E|4.0|The Intel Sandy Bridge line of processors is simply amazing. I have not a single complaint about them. The i3 is ideal for those who are simply doing web surfing and basic word processing. There are some older games that would likely run fine on this processor also. But, honestly it is the HD2000 graphics that have to be the biggest knock against this CPU (hence the 4 stars). But, that is about it! If you want to game with it, get a good graphics card and you'll be fine.  For reference, the i3-2320 is more powerful than some of the last generation Core i7s (such as the i7-930). Quite remarkable!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I didn't follow the BeeGees all that much back in the day but of course their<br />songs permeated the airwaves and became part of the background of the pop<br />music experience. What amazed me with this video was just how deep their<br />discography really is. And the BeeGees bring it to life here in this wonderful concert.<br />The production is fantastic and BeeGees hit their marks, in no way taking it<br />easy here as if they were shuffling out of retirement. No! They perform ALL of their<br />hits with emotion, professionalism and verve. This DVD raised my respect and<br />appreciation for the BeeGees.<br /><br />And there was one more huge benefit that came out of this video. We take care of my elderly Mom<br />here at home. Though she had never really known the BeeGees in her time, this<br />video gets her out of her chair every time, dancing with joy to these hits.<br />What more can you ask?
1416909532|5.0|This is a amazing book that makes u realize things u probably already knew but chose to ignore. It's not sugar coated just the cold hard facts and reality!!!!
B000UCIALE|2.0|Good action, good pacing. The dialogue is unspeakable, and dated in a pretentious way.  The basic idea of the Bourne character is interesting but the book should be rewritten by someone with a better ear.
B000AP04FG|3.0|This movie is not bad. I'm not a star fan at all, but for some reason I can't sit and enjoy this movie knowing that if this movie wasn't around Brad might still be married to Jen. I think Angelina is a good actress, but when I watch this movie I feel very disappointed in her. I really can't sit threw this movie with out those thoughts going threw my head. So I don't enjoy this movie.
0439023513|1.0|This train wreck of a finale (which made me wish I'd just skipped the ENTIRE triology--yes, *that* bad) was obviously the sad result of a money-hungry publisher rushing Collins to deliver on the third book asap...and Collins lacking the integrity to demand more time. Sadly, the hoopla of the trilogy is perpetuated by excited readers in who've just read the first or second book telling all their friends to read this Best! Trilogy! Ever! all before they get to this final disappointment of a book.<br /><br />Those of us 'detracting' aren't upset about the not-happy ending. Hello, this is a dystopian book about people killing each other. What we wanted was a well-constructed story that is somewhat satisfying. Which this is far from. The book reads like an unedited first-draft about to the torn to shreds in a freshman creative writing workshop. Why? Everything falls apart. Not only is the writing abysmal; the characters become these shoddily slapped-together stick figures who do things for no reason at all, disappear in a poof of exploding/chomped-on flesh, or just become wearisome in their psychotic inner-babble (that would be Katniss).<br /><br />The story fails in all the ways that it previously succeeded in the previous books (characters you care about, complex conflicts, stakes that matter, etc etc). Note that the readers who defend the book are generally adults who wax on about how war is hell and we have to accept realism, blah blah blah. But it isn't about whether we can 'handle' a depressing conclusion or not. It's about why we read stories in the first place--not just nonfiction. Stories have to matter, have to make us care. They aren't supposed to be didactic or manipulative. We don't come to them to get schooled on things. And even if this one was written with the main [lame] goal of making a point about society and war and crap, then it still could've been done in a well-crafted way that mattered a bit more. As a story. (Because if you're trying to just make a point, don't write a story. Write a nice persuasive essay.)<br /><br />And I'm a bit shocked that these books are being pushed on 10-year-olds. The first one maybe could be justified in its violence (i.e. a character getting his face slowly eaten off by mutant dogs) if only for its sense of justice, but hello, this last book is ridiculous for its pointless brutality. And I'm not one of those adults who think that children can't handle high drama or the realities of a violent world. But they shouldn't have to read badly-written stories. There's always Lloyd Alexander's classic Westmark Trilogy that includes [[ASIN:0141310693 The Kestrel (The Westmark Trilogy)], one of the more complex treatments of war out there for YA readers--that's actually sensitively and compellingly written. At the end of the day, I'd rather have kids reading this at school so at least they can discuss this, but the way it's being marketed as some sort of Next! Twilight! HP! is really scary.a point, don't write a story. Write a nice persuasive essay.)<br /><br />And I'm a bit shocked that these books are being pushed on 10-year-olds.

B0000VCZKW|5.0|I know this is a kids movie. But I can't help loving it. I think it is cute and funny. A great movie to watch.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I bought the cream laced ones. I didn't oder them from here I got them from Urban Outfiters. But these are my favorite shoes. They are soo comfy i don't want to take them off lol. But they're for a good cause so I encourage people to buy these shoes. The good thing about them is that every time you buy one shoe on gets donated to a kid in need of shoes. Also if you buy there sunglasses they'll donate a pair of eyeglasses for someone in need.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I bought the first Quell and loved it. Very challenging yet relaxing at the same time. Great new obstacles to make it more interesting. Definitely worth the .99 cents!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is woo fun to play and Sheba I do play I'm always making new neighboers and leaving tips on peoples tables
B00000EF8C|5.0|Great songs from 3 great years.  Octopus's Garden is one of my all time favorites!  Can listen to it over and over again and never tire of it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app. The games are good and I like the concept of winning points and buying games with those points instead of buying with money. The graphics could be better though...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this will be a awesome game! I hope I can get it! P.S ( I'm going to get it!)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|great graphics and new stuff. this could be even bigger than it already is. I bought this for my little sister. I got an A on a science test because of this and my study of gravatational fields.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I was going to get it but from the commits I not buing it!I think it will be dumb after a few secens.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I've been using this browser for only a few days now, and I already love it sooo much more than the factory browser that comes with this tablet.  The factory browser would just close for no reason making me lose anything I was working on.  I have had no such problems with this one, and the side load bookmarks and speed dial just make it that much quicker to navigate.  Very nice and so far worth all five stars I gave it!
B006QVRUS2|1.0|I really could'nt believe how bad this movie was. I expected so much more with such a stellar cast but alas NO, it was a tough 75 minutes.Then again i thought Tower Heist was unfunny too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished Book 1, and oh my couldn't put it down!! I didn't think I would like it from what I heard about it, but a friend convinced me to read it. So glad I did! I can't wait to read Book 2 & 3! Which I will get started on soon! Highly recommend this book!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I loved the book because it was told from a dog's perspective.  I could imagine myself being the dog trying to communicate with the rest of the world.  The book might not be believable because the story is told by a dog, but the story line is believable.  The story covered all emotions of sadness, happiness, life's realistic tragedies, and love that endures forever.  I loved the humour as well as the parallel between navigating life and driving a race car.  It's well written.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I watched this movie twice, back to back, each time it got better and better. There are funny scenes and a lot of sad scenes. Every man no matter what the color of their skin is should watch this movie. if you are a father, husband or of any status, it's the movie to watch. It is such a positive and encouraging movie. Thanks to everyone that had a part in it's making.I'll keep it forever.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|y do the people with ipods ipads and iphones get another map and they only pay 1$ but we pay 3
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I think Michelle Williams is just wonderful in My Week With Marilyn. It would be impossible for ANYONE to be Marilyn, of course. But Michelle Williams did a wonderful job learning Marilyn Monroe's mannerisms and did the best that could of been done with this movie. The costume designer was just amazing and the wardrobe flawless to what Marilyn wore in \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\". All in all movies are meant to entertain which this movie did, just know it is not a \\"documentary\\" it is a story like many movies mostly based on a fictional story. I do not believe Clark to be truthful nor did I ever from his original book. I found this movie entertaining and enjoyable to watch.
0743496736|5.0|I've read 4 other Jodi Picoult novels, all thought provoking but Nineteen Minutes will always be the one that rises above the others. Her obvious painstaking research clearly pays off as we are drawn into such real-life characters & situations that we read about in the newspapers all too frequently. Amazing work!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rovio mananges to come up with new games and still make them fresh and inovative. Well done.<br /><br />The kids love it, so it hit all the way around.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|after playing for a little while it starts 2 close itself wich makes it 2 where u cant play anymore.  This game is WORTHLESS.  DONT GET IT.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|I could not make it play in my computer as I connected it with a USB so I returned it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|At first I didn't realize how many versions there were to choose from, WOW! and the plans, and it will read to you, and it's soooo easy to share what we read. AWESOME!
1603425381|5.0|If you're like me and love to crochet but are still a novice, this book will be an important purchase for you.  If you struggle on how to finish out your projects, this is a must-have!!  The pictorial illustrations are VERY good and will encourage you to try them out :)
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Although there's a line of fire, the bird doesn't follow the line.  I prefer the other games.  There's no reason this game should cost $3...not worth more than $1
B00338QF0U|4.0|This is a great story and a good read, but Boyd's punctuation drove me to distraction!  He uses dashes/hyphens to extreme, to the point that it begins to overpower the story line.  Please, Mr Boyd - use normal punctuation, please!
B0063IH60K|3.0|I wish they would just charge for this app because I'm sick and tired of those stupid commercials every time I start a new game.  Since it's easy to stop them &amp;continue playing, I don't know why anyone would pay to advertise on an app with a video.  It's a nusense.  Unfortunately, none of the other solitaire apps are as good as this one.  Please just charge for it already!

1469984202|5.0|Captivating from the beginning!!, it's been awhile since a book did this to me, specially because this was my first purchase based on the amount of reviews the book has, I agree with one of the reviews that says this book becoming a classic, a must read must definitely.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I give this app four stars because its really neat but its slow sometimes and takes awhile to download but other than that its great! buy it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a fun game to pass time. I really enjoy the many different games that are all in one download.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I know probably this will attract some but this ap comes with many pornagraphic images as I have children who use my kindle frequently this will be deleted.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This isn't the kind of book I normally read but it was well-written and engaging, even funny. I ended up buying the trilogy and reading it straight through.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great app to get your solitaire fix with. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this book through without stopping. I didn't think it would be my kind of book and I admit I skipped through some of the love scenes
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that it reminds me to read daily, that way I have no excuse as to why I didn't
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Like a lot of folks, I read the John Carter series as a kid.  Then I read them again as a young adult.  And I re-read them again a few years ago (I'm now in my 50's).  I'd seen the lame attempts at trying to bring ERB's John Carter to the silver screen and kept wondering \\"When is a real studio going to take interest in this?\\"<br /><br />And finally, a \\"real\\" studio (Disney) has stepped up to the plate and brought the world a worthy adaptation of ERB's John Carter saga.<br /><br />Is it a perfect adaptation?  Nah...<br /><br />But it is pretty close.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />* Many of the longer shots were too tightly framed.  Barsoom needed a sense of greater space.<br />* Taylor Kitsch has adequate acting chops, but the character of John Carter is a hard man.  IMHO, TK just didn't have the gravitas to pull it off effectively.  He was pretty, but I just didn't see hard-won military experience and intense emotional loss in his face.  (This leaves me wondering why the director didn't consider either Mark Strong, Willem Dafoe, or another, more life-experienced actor, since they would have been more effective in portraying JC than Kitsch.  Kitsch's JC really needed a few more miles on him.)<br />* Barsoom was entirely too bright (minor physics queep, I know, but the director/editors should have toned down the day shots to better approximate the actual Mars).<br />* The bromance between Tars Tarkas and JC seemed heavily downplayed.  In the books, these two were fast friends and reliable battle partners.  It was there in this movie, but seemed to be brushed off to the side a bit.<br />* The lead-in segment was 5-10 minutes too long.  It needed to be edited down. (Although I did enjoy the humorous bits.)<br /><br />What did work:<br /><br />* The story: While an obvious blending of different parts of the first two books, as an adaptation, it hung together pretty well.<br />* The technical execution and art direction were first-rate-bordering-on-brilliant, especially the airships.  The other sets, props, and even the Tharks, all had that definite Barsoomian something.  Woola was awesome.<br />* Lynn Collins is the embodiment on Earth of Dejah Thoris in all of her smoldering, fierce, egg-laying glory.<br />* The end segment.  Shorter and more effective at getting JC back to Barsoom.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was okay, but it just didn't invoke the sense of alien awesomeness that the books do.  I'll definitely buy the BD when it comes out (especially if it has an additional 46 minutes of footage featuring more Dejah...)  I'd definitely like to see a sequel though, to see if the director can round things out a bit more and maybe bring a darker, more adult sensibility to life on Barsoom.  A little less swash and a little more buckle, I'm thinking...<br /><br />BTW, folks that insist on comparing this to Star Wars, Avatar, et al. may certainly be correct in comparing film-to-film.  As for who's deriving from whom though, they should keep in mind that ERB wrote his JC series 100 years ago.  And it's highly unlikely that Star Wars, Avatar, or what-have-you, would even exist in their present forms if ERB's John Carter series had not been written to inspire those stories' creators.
B005HXGE9G|3.0|This gets off to a terrific start with Rhythm and The Heat, but then Downside Up arrives and Peter's tone deaf daughter takes the lead on vocals. And apart from a certain predictability to the song selection, some of which really doesn't work, Melanie Gabriel just isn't going to make anyone forget Sinead O Connor, Paula Cole, and most especially Kate Bush. With Toyah Wilcox available, one wonders why Gabriel didn't reach out for her, or even a rejuvenated KB as foil. Lovely that father and daughter are so close, but she always sounds like she's singing Karaoke at a Viet Namese wedding. Whenever I hear that nasal drone enter the soundscape two words come to mind: \\"Linda\\" \\"McCartney\\". Yes that's better than \\"Yoko\\" \\"Ono\\", but why go there at all when surely two dramatists like Wilcox and Bush are back in the game. There's a reason Mary and Stella don't sing with their old man on record. The other female vocalist isn't any better. In fact, she is as nasal and reedy as Yoko. There wasn't anyone else?<br />A couple of tunes didn't sit with me: \\"In Your Eyes\\" has gone from an upbeat dance tune and love song to a funeral dirge. \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" lacks all of the neurotic urgency of the original. \\"Mercy Street\\" is flat. Might have been nice to recast \\"Dolce Vita\\" from the first record, even \\"Here Comes the Flood.\\" Gabriel says he made a deliberate decision not to do the expected. Is that what this is? Hmmm, could have fooled me. \\"San Jacinto\\" and \\"Red Rain\\" are terrific, but they were always kind of orchestral anyway. Perhaps \\"Zaar\\" or \\"I Grieve\\", \\"On the Air\\", \\"Jeux Sans Frontiers\\", even \\"It\\" from the Lamb would have been not what was expected. \\"Intruder\\" loses its menace and becomes a PMS lament once Melanie whines where he used to howl. For the life of me, I think he could have done a better job on \\"Solsbury Hill\\" as well. It's not bad, just totally unremarkable here. I'd have finished with \\"Moribund the Burgermeister\\", but that's me.<br />At its best, the orchestrations ring with the sort of avant sounding directions that composers like Erkki Sven Tuur and Peteris Vasks have been cultivating. So, maybe this will wind up the treading of water he's been effecting for too long and will get him back to writing. Next record, leave the family at home. T Lev isn't getting any younger. Don't wait too long, Peter.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app. I have all my favorite music and funny videos saved to my sd.  Even videos that I've erased from my phone.  If I want to retrieve them,  I grab them from my YouTube channel. The ability to convert to mp3 is great also. I've been using this app since it came out; and have absolutely NO complaints.

B006QVRUS2|4.0|Roman Polanski's CARNAGE is a savage little film that desires nothing less than to undercut both marriage and parenthood.  It revolves around two couples: uptight Penelope (Jodie Foster) and annoyingly placating Michael (John C. Reilly), and tightly-wound Nancy (Kate Winslet) and distracted business man Alan (Cristoph Waltz).  They've met to discuss a fight between their two children, and immediately the differences between the couples become glaring.  As the film progresses, the couples turn on themselves, so that eventually they're identifying with each other by criticizing their own spouses.<br /><br />It's a bleak film.  No violence, no gore, minimal cursing, but it's still a bleak, bitter film.  And yet immensely hilarious; Polanski and co-writer (and original playwright) Yasmina Reza have a truly twisted sense of humor, and find a great joke in the most disturbing situations. (When Penelope exclaims, \\"Your son brutalized our son!\\", Alan rejoins, \\"They're young!\\")  The four leads are admirable; it's nice to see Foster deliver a knockout performance again; Reilly gets another chance, after his rise to fame as a comedy actor, to go back to his dramatic chops; and Winslet and Waltz are at their primal best.<br /><br />And that's it.  Four great actors, one room, and a hallway.  There's humor, and there's tension, and at the center is a debate about parental blame: maybe your kids aren't messed up, maybe it's you.  CARNAGE isn't a perfect movie (the female characters are a bit too similar at times, and the ending comes rather abruptly, with only a feeble attempt at resolution), but it's certainly a good one, and earns its place among Polanskis' better (if maybe not best) films.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|This book is great...the workout plans are simple, effective and practical. They are varied enough to keep monotomy at bay. The IPAD app is also superb.

A great and very unusual talent.( by the way Caterina Valente was the first)and still is. Highly reccomended , just listen to a few of her songs on her website to convince yourself.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so cool. I love it the games are challenging and difficult and an extra 16 games are even better! I love love love love love this game.

B007BVOF8E|1.0|This movie was simply awful and did not live up to its billing.  If you like a movie which seem to be directed by someone who has advanced unmedicated ADHD then this movie is for you.  The scenes jump back and forth every minute and a half with no semblance of continuity.  The actors seem to be a bunch of mumbling old British men who we're dragged out of pub after church some afternoon and offered 50 bucks to come make a movie.  The scenes were about as drab and dreary as yard sale in a convent.  Amazon should have paid me to watch this movie.....I WANT MY MONEY BACK.  My wife dared me to watch the whole thing to see if I could stay awake.....it was a struggle but I did it.  My eyes still hurt.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I hope that many other people who get bored of the same games try playing this just by Kenneth lake

B006ZCWTV0|4.0|On his latest offering [[ASIN:B007F39498 Wrecking Ball]], Bruce Springsteen hits a `home run.' Wrecking Ball contains a set of eleven consistent cuts that speak to the recession-affected individuals containing relevant messages of hope and the unrelenting resolve to become stronger.  Easily Bruce's best recent offering, there are few rubs characterizing Wrecking Ball, making it one of 2012's crowning achievements as far as album releases are concerned.  Bruce, as well as Ron Aniello, serve as producers on this solid effort.<br /><br />The album explodes with the pummeling drums and simplistic harmonic progression of \\"We Take Care of Our Own,\\" which benefits from a nice, straight ahead, traditional rock and roll sound.  The evolution and gradual intensification of this cut are selling points, not to mention a well penned refrain: \\"We take care of our own...wherever this flag's flown/we take care of our own.\\" \\"Easy Money\\" loses no momentum, sporting a signature Springsteen-esque folk-rock feel.  Much like \\"We Take Care of Our Own,\\" Springsteen's songwriting and pacing is focused on the evolution and build-up of a song, making \\"Easy Money\\" another superb moment.  The background vocals on neutral syllables is a high point, not to mention the use of violin, acoustic piano, and organ.  Springsteen is certainly on his `game.'<br /><br />\\"Shackled and Drawn\\" is clever if for no other reason than containing elements of  James Brown's \\"Me and My Baby Got Our Own Thing Going.\\" Springsteen keeps the folk-rock groove intact and focuses on acoustic, organic sounds (rhythmic acoustic guitar, etc.). Springsteen's vocals are soulful and gritty, the background vocals enhance and accentuate, and the songwriting is easy-going, namely on the incredibly catchy refrain: \\"Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn/pick up the rock son, carry it on...\\" \\"Jack of All Trades\\" trumps its predecessor, adding Tom Morello on guitar.  The cut opens mysteriously and ominously and contrasts the pace of the three previous cuts, opting for a slower tempo.  Bruce definitely channels Bob Dylan here, in relation to songwriting and his approach to the performance (the influence shows). Again, pacing is a high point, particular as more instruments and elements are added to the superb arrangement including horns and strings.<br /><br />\\"Death To My Hometown\\" cedes nothing and contains elements of \\"The Last Words of Copernicus.\\"  The groove is optimistic and pounding, contrasting the solemnity that characterized \\"Jack of All Trades.\\"  The pummeling groove here gives Springsteen some `hip-hop credibility' to say the least, given the big, robust nature of the drums.  Who would've ever referenced Springsteen and hip-hop right? \\"The Depression\\" again taps Tom Morello for his guitar talents and has some particularly nice soloing.  The pace is slower, though the drums don't cease in volume or scope.  Vocally, Springsteen sounds `depressed' to exemplify and epitomize the lyrics and the title of the cut.  The sound of \\"This Depression,\\" like all other cuts, is well produced and crafted.  Title track \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" like the six preceding cuts does not disappoint, yielding yet another noteworthy addition.  The optimism of \\"Wrecking Ball\\" helps to make it so enjoyable, given its thudding percussive groove, which enters upon the second verse, not to mention those well orchestrated strings and horns. Bruce sings with conviction \\"Bring on your wrecking ball/bring on your wrecking ball/c'mon and take your best shot/let me see what you got/bring on your wrecking ball...\\" Seven for seven.<br /><br />\\"You've Got It\\" continues to compel, again evolving into full fruition with horns and clearly produced Springsteen vocals.  \\"Rocky Ground\\" may be less compelling than some of the best, but loses very little momentum if any.  Michelle Moore is featured on vocals here.  The cut opens with an ominous synth sound at the beginning. Here, Bruce strips the production for the first time, contrasting the production heaviness of previous cuts.  The songwriting remains solid and the use of choir is brilliant.  \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" may be lengthy at just under seven minutes, but it is one Wrecking Ball's best.  Featuring a beautiful saxophone solo by the late great Clarence Clemons and showcasing Bruce at his best where songwriting and arranging are concerned, \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" is a treat as the album's penultimate cut.  Closer \\"We Are Alive\\" has a lot of competition in its predecessor, and while it doesn't quite pull of the `upset,' it is appropriately placed and features the same sound orchestrations and instrumental portions as other cuts do.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B007F39498 Wrecking Ball]] is Bruce's strongest and perhaps most relevant release in years.  Well produced, well written, and well conceived, there are many more stronger points than weaker ones. No overt misses and a perfect duration of just over fifty minutes makes Wrecking Ball valedictory and a sound addition to any music lover's collection.he production heaviness of previous cuts.

0812979656|5.0|It's not so much a story, as a tale that you go through. It has no real ending, except in the middle of the book. Although you don't really mind because you become so attached to the characters you just enjoy the ride.<br /><br />It reminded me a lot like Extremly Loud and Incredibly Close in that writing style of you never have any closure but you have so much to think about.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|I read this book years ago and I remembered being surprised by the ending. Of course, after thirty years, I forgot how it ended. Well, it was worth reading again. This book is a fast, enjoyable read. If you like twists and turns in your stories, you should not overlook this book. It is truly the best spy story I have read to date!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the different games and the ability to play to unlock more games/levels. Don't care so much for the ads.....
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I loved this book! I think it was better for me not knowing anything about the story before reading it - that way I got to know the characters and like them before any ethical issues appeared. I still love these characters. Well done Jojo Moyes

B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5's Songs About Jane is a modern masterpiece. They have a funky, cool sound that I've never heard from a band before. This album will make any woman swoon. I'm not going to lie, \\"She Will Be Loved\\" makes me a little weak in the knees. \\"Sunday Morning\\" is just like it sounds: Easy like Sunday morning. It's fun, it's cool, and it's great to listen to.<br /><br />Their first single on the album was \\"Harder to Breathe\\", which I think sounds a lot different from the rest of the album. Not in a bad way, just different. If you didn't like that single, give the rest of the album a chance. You're bound to find something you like!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this app is awesome! the only problem is all of the adds, but no changing that cause its the free version.
B0002858YS|5.0|This is my favourite album by the Killers. It's catchy without being lame. \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is one of their biggest hits and it has a sound we've never really heard before. I love Brandon Flowers' monotonous voice. You would think it would get annoying, but it doesn't.<br /><br />My favourite song is \\"All These Things that I've Done\\". I love the different parts of it and the chant of \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\". Ain't that the truth. I would recommend this album to anyone who is in the mood for a different sound.
B00466HN72|1.0|The movie itself is not bad. Not overwhelmingly great, but still cute. However, if you are buying a movie for the digital copy, DO NOT BUY ULTRAVIOLET!!!! The ultraviolet digital copy makes you set up two different accounts and you still cannot transfer it to iTunes. After contacting customer service several times I received the same information which was not helpful at all and was still unable to watch the digital copy except on my computer after logging into these weird accounts. Digital copy is useless if it is ultraviolet!!!
6305212112|5.0|I can't believe some people have this movie a negative review. How can you hate this movie? I love it, regardless of how many times I've seen it. The story itself is beautifully told. Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, and the two Marys are perfect in these roles. I grew up watching this movie and it only gets better. I wish I had a friendship like these women.<br /><br />I like this DVD, too. I'm a sucker for special features, and this DVD is packed with them. The featurettes and cast interviews were very enlightening and I enjoyed learning more about the production. Fannie Flagg should be very proud of what her book turned into.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Better graphics then the other angry bird games but like many other people it will randomly close when i'm in the middle of playing, fix this and ill rate higher,i only rated 3 instead of lower cuz i understand that its a new app still and had bugs to be worked out
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I love this movie and can watch it over and over. It is a fabulous display of 1950s culture. As a modern woman in college, it was interesting for me to see such intelligent women toss their degrees aside in favour of just being a wife and mother. The character of Joan shows that this is not necessarily a bad thing. She wanted to be educated, but she also wanted the life of a wife and mother. Feminism isn't defined by excelling in your career and avoiding marriage at all costs. It's about being empowered to make your own choices. If a woman chooses to be a wife and mother, good for her. I think the movie did a fine job of showing the different choices women can make.<br /><br />Aside from the feminism debate, this movie was just plain entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it and think others would, too. I like the story and its use of humour. I would recommend this movie to anyone who like low-key period pieces.
B002JH3TW8|3.0|I don't know if I should have known this, but this does not fit the 1394 port on my new Dell Latitude laptop.  The working parts are the same size and shape, but the black plastic surround apparently is different on Macs (that will work with this piece, I assume), but is much too large to fit into the port on my Dell.<br />Oh well seems like a nice accessory.  Amazon handled the return no problem.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Excellent product - arrived in a timely fashion - great value.  I am surprised that it can be sold for such a low price - just goes to proved what can actually be done for the buyer when companies try.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the worlds best angry bird game I ever saw in my life . thank you people who made this game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Have tried a couple of other weather apps for the Kindle Fire and this is definitely my favorite. Love the real time radar.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|got hooked from day one. love all the options for mini games. every day a different game. like buying new games with coins earned
0439023521|5.0|I don't normally go for this genre (futuristic, sci-fi), but succumbed to all the media hype and the recommendations of some trusted friends. And wow - did it live up to the hype. This book is a page turner from the very start, when you meet young Katniss Everdeen and the sad world she lives in. Her story takes place in a future state - in land once occupied by North America, but now designated as the nation of Panem, which rules over its twelve districts with a heavy hand (incidentally, \\"Panem\\" is derived from the Latin \\"panem et circenses\\" or, bread and circuses: provision of the means of life and recreation by government to appease discontent). The irony here is that Panem keeps its citizens down by keeping them in poverty and always hungry. And as punishment for and a reminder of a failed coup attempt against the Capitol, each district must surrender one boy and one girl to participate in  The Hunger Games each year, a fight to the death broadcast on live TV.<br /><br />I assumed it would be a violent, graphic novel based on this premise, but was pleasantly surprised to discover a story more focused on survival, strategic thinking, and human compassion. Collins actually provides some underlying social commentary on pop culture's fascination with absurd reality TV programming, our reduced sensitivity to violence and war, and the real impact of material possessions - including food - on the haves and have-nots. A great book to analyze in that high-school or College English class!<br /><br />But putting analysis aside, The Hunger Games is a wonderfully entertaining story about a girl coming of age in a complicated world, learning to survive - quite literally, but also figuratively - and you'll find yourself rooting for her every step of the way (and brainstorming ways to get her out of the situation she's in!). I can't wait to read Book 2, and of course see the movie that came out today - I imagine Hollywood had a field day with the costumes and special effects forthis one (just hope they didn't make it too gory). And I predict Katniss will make it onto the top 100 Baby Names for 2012/2013 list ;)
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|I PAID FOR IT AND WHEN I TRIED TO DOSNLOAD IT TO MY KINDLE IT SAID SORRY PLEASE TRY AGAIN RIP OFF!!!!!!;/
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this app because I like to play games, but I don't like having to unlock games by earning points. some of these games are also not worth playing at all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|App is a good waste of time when you have a few minutes to kill. Smooth animation and simple layout. Good fun
B00407PNY2|5.0|As it happens, I am very informed about this movie. I worked the city streets when this film was made in San Francisco. I delivered newspapers to many of the locations depicked in the movie. I know all the streets where the auto race took place between the bad guys and Steve Mcqueen. If you like adventure at every turn, then I think this is  your movie. Sub plots all over the place and the ending is one for the books. It is one of Steve's best for action and reaction. A very good police story that happened in my favorite city,San Francisco!!!!!.
1449382673|5.0|I tried finding instructions on the web; nothing good. I have some programming background from way back, so the basic concepts were easier for me to grasp. This book is far better for people with limited (but some basic) programming background. It will seem goofy at first, but despite all the pictures, it is serious and for adults (as well I suppose as kids). Previously I tried using James Payne's Beginning Python: Using Python 2.6 and Python 3.1 (Wrox, 2010), which was not very user-friendly - in fact, downright difficult. I feel like with the present book, I make quick progress and yet it's not tedious. I am impressed and would definitely recommend this to others. I hope that they plan a follow-up edition for intermediate programming.<br /><br />(The differences between Python 2.x and 3.x are apparently fairly minor, once you find them. Hence my guess is that you could use this book for Python 2.x also, if you want. But Python 3.x seems to be the stable future of the language, so if you are just starting, it seems to me that you should go with 3.x.)
B002AOWXQ8|4.0|Indeed this is a wonderful album! The only beef I have is that it doesn't have quite the same enthusiasm as their live act! ([...]) I just bought tickets to see them live at the Ryman and I can't wait! Give them a listen, you won't regret it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is extremely addicting. I couldn't put it down. Most of the reviews are bad because of a bug in the earlier version but it has been fixed.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|the main thing I like about this version of angry birds is new challanges however more levels would have been a wise choice before the release of the game. I would be more than happy to give a five star rating when new levels are released
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is totally awesome. I can not wait for the third book. I can not also wait for Annabeth and Percy to see eachother again.
B00000099Y|5.0|It just cant go wrong with Tool.<br />It does take a while to get into the songs though, many listens. But its so worth it in the end! Once you really get to know the sounds, the lyrics, the meaning.. Its really something special that I have never in my 20 years as a prog metal fan, experienced before.<br /><br />Favorite songs are H. , Aenema, Stinkfist.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just love this book. I've read it the first time cover to cover in less than a week. Then I thought I loved it even more. I still go back to Prims death and cry  and cry! I also still go back to Rues death  and sing the song and cry. such an Amazing book! Congrats Suzan! Congrats!
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is something extraordinary. It grows on you, and takes a good while to get into.<br />It is so worth your time!<br />These songs, the meaning, the lyrics have helped me so much when experiencing hard times in life. Nothing can make me feel so calm and at peace, as a Tool song. Here is a great collection of them, my favorites being \\"Parabol-Parabola\\" \\"The patient\\" and the one that always makes me laugh: \\"Ticks and leeches\\" .<br /><br />Great job, Tool!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Got it on my kindle fire and if works great! I love angry birds and this is the best one yet! I fully recommend this!
B005T87QCI|2.0|the controls are confusing at first but then I got used to it, also the opponents in tourtament are kinda hard. and the game is way to short
0312641893|5.0|I listened to this book on my Ipod and I have to say I absolutely loved it. While the ending was a bit predictable, it didn't detract at all from the exceptional quality of Marissa Meyer's writing and the overall experience of this engaging story. This may be a twist on the Cinderella fairytale (and there are elements from other fairytales, too), but the similarities really are minor. Cinder is a completely unique concept: a futuristic science fiction story about a cyborg mechanic, a worldwide pandemic, tense relations between Earthens and Lunars, and, of course, a gorgeous prince. Not since Ella Enchanted by Gail Carsen Levine has a fairytale so completely captured the hearts of its readers or deserved so many accolades.<br /><br />In addition, I have to mention that this story is set in future China and that its characters are therefore Chinese. This fact is not heavy-handed at all. Nowhere are their Asian features described. We only make that inference from the setting, cultural landmarks and clothing, and their names. But I think in this day and age when the need for more cultural and racial diversity in books is a growing topic of interest, Cinder should stand as an example for others to follow. I applaud Ms. Meyer for reaching beyond our white/American comfort zone and creating a multi-cultural story we all can enjoy.<br /><br />A word about the age appropriateness of this story.  Cinder is considered YA, for ages 12 to 18, probably because the characters are in their late teens. But I found nothing in this book that would be inappropriate for younger audiences. Rather, the story and the writing itself is fine for middle grade readers. There is a single kiss and very minor violence involving a gunshot, but otherwise I plan to hand this to my nine and eleven-year-old kids as soon as I get my hands on a print version. This book is worth adding to my permanent home library.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, according to Ms. Meyer's blog, the sequel, Scarlett, is forthcoming. Can't wait.
B00555X8OA|5.0|A must read... Is a great description of how we make the decisions we make. Easy read, and keeps you interested... Could not stop reading.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|same problem as others, app wont open, goes to black screen then closes. I will unistall and 1&#9733; until fixed.  Was looking forward to this one, btw they should have a code on the merchandise I buy (tshirts, figures, etc.) to download the ad free version for free, or at least a code to unlock special levels.  P.S. I want 25% of the profits for the idea lol
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have been waiting for this. It is as good as I hoped. So much better than the DVD. Definitely did not disappoint.
B005HSL626|4.0|This app is very fun for kids and other people to play. I would recommend this app for other people like my friends or family. Have a nice day!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Fun game but when you hit the show element hint button, the element will flash for a millisecond and then goes to the groups page so you never get a hint. kindle fire
630587493X|1.0|Weak sci-fi. Like Disney movies for kids. I couldn't wait until it was over! I would never watch a second time. Mork calling Orson!
B007N5YIUS|3.0|not near WiFi for the next couple of days and now its stuck on my top bar. these apps need to say WiFi required.
B004VRL4BM|5.0|I've watched all 4 previous series with rapt attention. This 5 season maintains the reputation of the series as one of intense action and sci fi enjoyment. If you've not seen this, it's well worth checking out. [...]
B006W0QOF2|1.0|There are no words to describe how crappy this movie is. I cannot believe I decided to waste my friday night watching this piece of junk. There is nothing in this movie, unless you are such a huge sucker for the emotional that you do not care if the attempts are obvious and fake. I would not have been able to sit through the movie if I did not have a 24 hour time limit to finish the movie in. I am desperately trying to remotely understand the good reviews that this movie got. There is very little action. And the little action that they did manage is as bad as watching monkeys brawling over a banana in the zoo. The only good part about the movie is Carey Caulfield. She isn't pretty or hot. But she has to be the cutest girl I have seen on screen.<br /><br />If you have a three digit IQ, you will not like it. The action sucks, the acting is worse, and there isn't enough space in amazon's review section to describe how bad the direction and the actual implementation of the story is. Having said that, the story line isn't bad. But the way the story is shown is terrible. I mean for god's sake he doesn't even 'DRIVE' very well. I am 23 years old and if the society calls for all conformants to like this crap, I'm afraid I am going to have to move to a planet where actors can act and the actor in a movie named 'DRIVE' can drive. Anyway to sum it up in points:<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />1) Very cute actress.<br />2) The story line is not too shabby.<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />Everything else.<br /><br />Watch it if they give it to you for free.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Best game ever can play day or night and not destrube any one else. Have told other about this game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't like the way that you have to earn a so much points to unlock one game. Some are pretty fun but others not so much.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I just love this game, easy download every time, purchases to my kindle fire are so easy.great quality for my monies, plan to purchase more games in the future
B00475AYJQ|3.0|If you're only interested in prose, you will enjoy this book.  Patrick Rothfuss poetically describes scene after scene while characters engage in witty banter.  If story progression and epic fantasy, are important to you, you should look elsewhere.  I loved Name of the Wind, but this book seemed stumble all over itself.<br /><br />Writing Style:  Awesome!<br />As many have mentioned, there's something about Rothfuss's classic writing style that makes you want to keep turning pages.  There is some charm, wit, prose, poetry...  And after reading this book, you'll probably look at things in the real world a bit differently.  His metaphors are enlightening.  His dialogue is entertaining.  His declarations are wise.  His songs are poetic.  This is the ultimate strength of the series.  Many parts of this book feel like classic literature and that's no small feat.<br /><br />Story:  Fail!<br />Unfortunately, if you're looking for a great story with momentum, it's not here.  This book reads like an American Pie film.  Think I'm crazy?  Let me summarize the first 650 pages for you.  A guy is in college, hanging with his buddies, and playing jokes on people.  He takes a bit of time off to study abroad and sleeps with a hot foreign chick.  He returns as a stud and his newfound sexual prowess makes him a hit with all of the ladies.  I kept waiting for Eugene Levy to show up and give an awkward description about how to use a condom correctly or Stiffler to make an ass out of himself.<br /><br />This is a book about Kvothe telling a scribe a story about his youth.  Unfortunately, Kvothe's youth is full of other people telling him stories.  So, this ends up being a book about a guy telling stories about other people telling stories.  And in some cases, it's about a guy telling stories about people telling stories about other people telling stories.  The worst part about this is that he skips over all of the major events of his life.  There's a trial that nearly gets him expelled from the university, that is summarized in a few sentences.  There's also a pirate attack, a shipwreck, being stranded at sea, that is briefly mentioned.  But every time he sits in a tavern with his buddies, everyone's outfits and meals are described to the fullest detail.<br /><br />In the Name of the Wind, Kvothe was driven, but outside factors kept thwarting his investigation of the mysterious Chandrian; this made him endearing.  In this book, Kvothe's own character flaws and arrogance seem to thwart his investigation.  He will blurt out something at the worst time or do something to greatly offend the wrong person.  This belittles Kvothe's quest to track down the Chandrian.  If the guy can't keep his emotions in check for a few weeks to get some new intel, then this Chandrian thing doesn't seem all that important.  Kvothe should just give it up, be a lute rockstar, and have crazy sex with all the girls on campus.  He just seems like a pompous jerk.  This book is really missing an antagonist.  But then you realize that the main antagonist in the book is Kvothe.<br /><br />For 1000 pages, there is also very little story progression.  Only 10% of the book actually advances the story.<br /><br />Characters:  Good<br />The characters feel like real people, and not medieval archetypes.  This is refreshing... for a while... They're entertaining and the dialogue is fun.  The professors are all quirky, but helpful.  Kvothe's friends develop (off screen).  There are some mercenary characters that are a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Action:  Poor<br />When there is action, Kvothe seems more powerful than Gandalf and Jackie Chan combined.  It just feels wrong.  And many of the scenes that you want to read about are glossed over or described in faux martial arts terms.  Kvothe executes turning wheel followed by sparrow's beak, but his attack is parried by tiger's breath.<br /><br />World Building:  Interesting<br />A new warrior race is introduced to the story and their customs, beliefs, language, hierarchy, and history and completely developed in great detail.  This part of the book is very well done.  Kvothe also becomes the sex slave of a fae creature and her realm, history, beliefs, are also well thought out.<br /><br />Maturity:  Adults<br />The book begins with Kvothe in college, but the whole second half of the book is full of sex and graphic violence.  Kvothe doesn't even wear pants for a month.  Not kidding.<br /><br />Overall:  Mixed<br />You will devour this book if you want hundreds of pages of tavern scenes with a classic and entertaining writing style.  And if you can appreciate a fully developed fantasy race, you will enjoy that part as well.  But if you're looking for a story with momentum, this isn't it.  One major problem with the Kvothe telling his life to a scribe is that you can only get Kvothe's perspective, so all of the other characters feel like props.  If it was a wise sage telling the story of Kvothe, then he could get into Kvothe's life and all of the other characters.  OR if this was simply an epic adventure told as it was happening, it would have more momentum and you would actually start rooting and cheering for Kvothe as he struggles on his quest.  But in the end, this just feels like Kvothe telling a scribe a story about how he told everyone how awesome he was back in his college days.<br /><br />Read this book if you like poetic writing and wit.<br />Read this book if you want a fantasy novel that reads like literature.<br />Avoid this book if pacing and momentum are important to you.<br />Avoid this book if you want a fast paced adventure.
0545305497|5.0|I got the books in record time and packaged very nicely. The price was unbeatable and my daughter was thrilled to have gotten them.

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|I found the mood music totally irritating.  To me, it sounded like a diesel engine with sloppy valves.  To have this on top of voices is unbearable.  I though my sound system had gone bonkers because I could not understand the voices.  Then I realized they were attempting a Swedish accent.  On top of that, it was dark, I suppose for effect.  Don't know what to think of Rooney Mara.  They did a terrible makeup job on her, more like a Vampire chic.  I preferred the \\"don't mess with me vision of Noomi Rapace\\".  One must look at the face of Noomi, one can not avoid it.  She acts more with her eyes and her mouth than with words.  One does not have to look at Rooney more than once or twice.  Rooney does have a nice girlish body that does not fit the discription of the book's Salander.  After all that, it is an good adaption of the book.  I am just not a fan of Fincher.  Think Alien 3.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very, very good. I love this app. There are hundreds of different reading plans. This is definitley the best Bible app ever. The only thing that needs to be improved is being able to use the Bible without wifi. But, overall this is wonderful.
B0072X2O66|5.0|Amazing musicianship, sophisticated songwriting, and heavy as hell!  Think Pantera, Disturbed, Blaze, Avenged Sevenfold, and Symphony X all rolled up into one, but with a sound that is both unique and original.  Admittedly, compared to Dream Theater and Symphony X, Adrenaline Mob may comes across as somewhat minimalist (most music does when compared to more progressive variants), but this is by no means a bad thing.  In NO way is Adrenaline Mob simplistic, watered down, or uninspired like some of the negative reviewers would like you to believe.  In contrast, Omerta is a welcomed breath of fresh air.  The level of inspiration and energy on this album is unsurpassed.  I only wish that some of the more critical fans could put their personal feelings toward Mike Portnoy and the Dream Theater \\"soap opera\\" aside, pull the cotton out of their ears, and appreciate this album for what it is.  Considered objectively, this is a tremendous record.  I would highly recommend this album.
0375869026|5.0|I have read many young adult books during my teaching career and this is one of the very best books I have ever read, for young adults and \\"older\\" adults. Touching, heartbreaking, inspiring, funny all at the same time. I found myself crying and laughing out loud. The writing is exquisite. The characters are absolutely believable, not one false note. Palacios manages to write from five different perspectives ranging from a 5th grader with a facial deformity to a teenage girl with pink hair. The story is extremely engrossing. This is a must read. Congratulations to the author. Amazing.
0439023483|1.0|Young kids killing young kids, not good.  Was a very disturbing movie.  I am afraid of why so many young people like the movie and books.  What does this say of our future society?

B002KKBVAQ|5.0|This is fantastic. I was a little disappointed that another reviewer thought the balls were magnetic and dangerous for that reason. The balls do stick to the magnets that are sturdily built into the rods, but are not magnetic themselves. My 7-year old daughter loves this. You will need multiple sets or as many<br />parts as you can get to build larger structures. The whole family enjoys this--young and not-so-young.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app great for sucurity and playing jokes. I love this app. One thing that i dont like is that sometimes when im on my tablet looking at the computer if i get on computer and click somthing it frezzes up my tablet making me have to reset other wise great app.
B000SZK41M|5.0|I love this movie, it has great action, and the characters pull me right into the story without even realizing it. However, I am sad that Amazon does not have Die Hard 2! I would love to own all of them! It is a great series and I would recommend it to anyone.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|To me, this is the best version of Angry Birds to date. The graphics and gameplay are awesome. I like the idea that you have to factor in the gravitational pull of the moons and planets when playing. Good job with this one, Rovio. It finally feels like a new game!
0439023521|5.0|Wow. I know i'm late on reading this book , but who cares? It's such a good book and i'm going to buy the other two books as soon as possible! I'd write more , but my review's going to get pushed down anyways. I just wanted to give it the five stars i think it deserves.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I liked it didnt play very long but its still on my device. My daughter newly 7 also loves it its the first thing she looks for whenever Im nice enough to allow her to use my kindle fire. I had no troubles with forced closings or with freezing.

B007JUWM64|2.0|This movie had lots of potential but fell very short of it.  It was predictable, and cheesy (and not the good kind of cheesy).  Special effects were good but nothing ground breaking.  I was hoping for a Three Musketeers movie that took itself more seriously than the 1993 version.  This movie was nothing more than the 1993 version redoux.  I don't blame the actors, I blame the direction and the script.
0812992792|5.0|Reading \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" brought to mind \\"1984\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" But, unlike the settings of these classics of speculative fiction, North Korea is real. Adam Johnson had me shaking my head in amazement that such a place could exist, and turning the pages to find out what would happen next.
B007IK44CK|1.0|I found this to be the second least enjoyable installment of the MI series (the number one being MI:2). Jeremy Renner was the most convincing actor and interesting character, and he barely had any time on screen in which Tom Cruise wasn't being \\"TOM CRUISE\\". Although, Cruise did a decent job in the last few, tender minutes of the movie.

0307477479|3.0|This novel shares a characteristic with another recent novel, The Imperfectionists.  They both deal with a rotating cast of characters, interrelated through some thematic thread. They both unfold in a series of chapters that could be viewed as self-contained stories or, as I likened the segments of The Imperfectionists, episodes in a mini-series.<br />In The Imperfectionists, the unifying thread was an international newspaper based in Rome. With Goon Squad it is a cast of characters that have six degrees or less of separation from the music industry, specifically the punk movement of the 70's. Rock and roll seems to me to have always been difficult to depict in fiction without resorting to cliché. For one thing, aspiring as well as successful musicians often conduct their careers through a series of clichés and it is easy to convey the flavor of the music business without delving terribly deeply into a depiction of characters that are more than representative types.  Egan is more successful when she takes the characters out of the rock and roll setting and sets them off on winding paths throughout their subsequent lives. Probably the characters that are the most memorable, partly because they appear more frequently than any others, are Sasha and her one-time employer, failed punk rocker turned music mogul Bennie Salazar.<br />She is largely successful at getting inside the minds of characters who all have dark sides. From the kleptomaniac to the would be rapist to the suicidal depressive she places the reader inside their minds.  Depicting the characters at different stages of their lives also helps flesh out their personalities. At certain points I was infuriated by the overreaching cleverness in episodes that seemed to call far too much attention to themselves. However, as the novel progressed I understood connections between characters and realized the scope of what she was trying to accomplish. She certainly doesn't lack ambition. The time frame spans the 70'sto the 2020's, meaning that she embarks on the territory of speculative fiction in the future segments. The brother's obsession with pauses in songs points to the theme of broken threads through time that is itself a continuous thread in this novel.  The depiction of a future culture where tastes are largely determined by preverbal toddlers who `text message' their wants is fascinating, even if it lacks plausibility. The changes to mass communication brought about by the evolution of language are carried to logical extremes although, again, I suspect that the cultural climate she presents in 2020-something is also fairly implausible.<br />One of Egan's major themes, that time takes us down several winding paths in unexpected directions and changes us in ways we could never have predicted, is nothing new. The scrambled structure conveys this theme more provocatively than a linear, chronological sequence would have done. Although I can understand the justification of the time-hopping structure I feel that I only caught brief glimpses of these characters and couldn't get to know them as well as I could if I'd spent more than two successive chapters with them. Except for Sasha and Bernie, I had to recalibrate and reconfigure characters in my mind with each subsequent chapter. Perhaps this proves that Egan succeeded in doing what she set out to do. Perhaps a second reading would confirm that. However, since I don't think it warrants a second reading any time soon, this impression will have to suffice. If I were grading the novel, I'd give it an A for ambition, B- for execution.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great for keeping ur kids busy when u need to get things done when ur out n about
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is entertaining and will keep you busy for a while. The levels are quick so you can play even if you only have a minute, but there are a ton of levels. Different groups of levels each have their own &quot;twist&quot; on gameplay which keeps it interesting.
B007M6P01O|4.0|This is a great little series IF you love getting the crap scared out of you time and time again and are tired of shows that always end on a happy fuzzy note. It's a terrible series if you value intelligent, thought-provoking dialogue and characters that don't stretch the boundaries of believability time and time again until you find yourself shouting at the zombie, \\"Eat her already, I'm tired of her whining. And while you're all at it, pick up that holier than thou sheriff and his wife too would you????\\" I really did try to dislike this series on that basis alone, really I did since I found the characters annoying and incredibly stupid in ways that defy even the most basic logic. For instance, Season 2 opens with our band of heroes (such as they are) stranded on an open highway. Now, they've been dealing with the walking undead for an entire season already. They should know this is a very, very bad situation. And yet, they wander around poking into vehicles while talking loudly acting as if it's just another Sunday afternoon at the park. When the zombies show up, as they do (they ALWAYS do) our little band is woefully unprepared for them. YET AGAIN. What happens from there could be called a comedy of errors, but I didn't find myself laughing. Instead, I kept reaching for the off button finding myself increasingly irritated and annoyed with the lot of them. But, like a train wreck or that bad auto accident that one passes on the freeway I found myself unable to look away. So I kept watching. I have to say as zombie shows go this one rocks, the walking undead are fascinating characters all by themselves, to heck with the human survivors. And who doesn't enjoy a good zombie show just for the vicarious thrill of seeing some undead former person slowly and implacably snarling and lunging forward determined to do one thing and one thing only, snack on living flesh! And oh the joy of screaming, \\"Run already you idiots!\\" as you get that first glimpse of a band of zombies around the corner knowing that the people are going to blunder right into the middle of them.<br /><br />Besides I love a good survive against all odds TV show or movie even if I do tell myself time and time again, \\"I would so rock that situation since I'm way smarter than any of these people.\\" And then I realize that part of the point of this series is that no, maybe I wouldn't be that smart. I might just do as many dumb, clueless things as its characters do. Why? Because they are human after all, ordinary people that may have been nice enough folks as you passed them on your way to a Sunday afternoon barbecue back when the world was normal. And yet, just like you they find themselves woefully, stupidly unprepared to survive in this new human eat human world. So do what I did if you're watching this series. Grab a good pillow or blankie to hold up to your face during the grosser moments, make peace with the fact that the human survivors are going to do dumb things repeatedly and cheer like mad for them and the zombies and place your bets on who wins with your friends. The one thing this show isn't is dull and boring and predictable. EVER. And in the end that's what makes this a great series after all in spite of its flaws. The fresh and the unexpected will draw you back time and time again.  Heck, right now I'm so hooked I have to admit I'd actually watch reality TV if it had zombies in it. \\"Snookie, drop that dress and run. There's a zombie shuffling up the aisle straight towards you!\\" So yeah, even though I keep telling myself I won't watch Season 3 when it comes out the sad truth is I probably will, at least until or if it gets boring and predictable.<br /><br />Let's face it folks, The Walking Dead is one of life's guilty pleasures.

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I should have seen this in theaters...this is a fantastic movie!  What a ride, entire family loved, loved it!!  Seriously, why exactly was this not nominated at the Academy Awards??  We kept waiting for a point in the movie to stop it and get a snack...it never came...non-stop action!  I think the doggie, Snowy was our favourite character.  I absolutely recommend this movie for kids, teens and mom and dad! There was some action adventure so maybe not the little kids.  Outstanding animation, voices, acting and amazing effects.  One question...when does the next one come out??
B003EYVXV4|5.0|See it.<br /><br />I admit, I was leery when I heard the concept.  24 kids (12 boys and 12 girls from the ages of 12-18) are forced to participate in a battle to the death.  It sounds totally sick, right?  But that's the point, it's how the government of this future dystopia controls its citizens.  The \\"game\\" is televised and the citizens are forced to watch.  Most of the adults involved in running the game seem somewhat inhuman, and again, that's part of the point.  The game tarnishes the souls of everyone involved: the government, the audience, and the players.  We, the audience of the film, are rooting for the heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence - who was my favorite part of X-Men: First Class.  If I knew ahead of time that she was the star, I would have had no worries about this movie.) hoping that she somehow survive with both her body and soul intact.<br /><br />Naturally, due to the nature of the story, it is quite violent, but cleverly held at a PG-13 level.  I don't advise letting your younger children see this.<br /><br />This is apparently the first of a trilogy.  This first story does come to a conclusion, but I can see how it could continue.  From my perspective, the people running the game cheat...<br /><br />I have only one negative comment: shaky cam must die as soon as possible!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Grabs you gradually and brings you along for the ride. Very well done, The acting is about as good as it gets, the story better. Nice watch.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I have always been aware of Dr. Who but somehow it seemed daunting to slog through 40+ years of material.  We somehow got into Torchwood and enjoyed it, but started getting an inkling that Jack was actually from Dr. Who and got curious.  In fact, it turns out that Torchwood is an anagram for Doctor Who.  So having completed Children of Earth and waiting for the next series to hit DVD, we checked it out.<br /><br />THE SERIES<br /><br />It seemed campy to me, and I didn't love the characters when I first met them, but it didn't take long to warm to them.  By the end, I loved them and respected them both deeply in important ways: they had depth and character beyond many characters on other shows, even to a greater extent I think than on Torchwood, but of course there are two main characters here, so there is more time to explore them.  The Doctor and Rose both have a lot of heart and care a lot for each other - more as the story goes on - though Rose shows it from the beginning, and The Doctor opens up more as it goes on.  The characters are also intelligent, as are the stories.<br /><br />Like Torchwood, stories are unusual for science fiction, if you would even call it that.  I won't say there are NO space ships or that nothing blows up, and there is one scene that reminded me of a Hollywood action event, but these things are not the point.  The point is the stories, the drama, the PEOPLE.  The people make this show worth watching.  The events in the stories are mysterious, but in general there is usually something human - or something unusually alien - behind events and characters.<br /><br />There are a couple of stories that are complex enough that they had to span two episode to get fleshed out and resolved.  One in particular is one of the highlights of the series IMO.<br /><br />It is and is not violent.  When it is violent, it is not in the usual way.  A lot of people, or aliens, do die in the course of events.  \\"Death follows Dr. Who\\" is one of the slogans, and it's true, though it is generally as a result of problems he is trying to solve (that is, people are killed by aliens) or a sacrifice in the solution (people or aliens must die to solve the problem).  He tends not to kill directly so much as let it happen when it must.<br /><br />TORCHWOOD COMPARISON AND OVERLAP<br /><br />Unlike Torchwood, there is very little sexual tension in the stories.  I would not say none by any means, particularly when Captain Jack makes his appearance; after all, he's kind of an omnisexual guy.  But this series IS suitable for a younger audience than Torchwood, which has implied sex, and some a bit more than that.<br /><br />It was really fun to meet the cast of Torchwood, as we half-expected to do.  We knew we would meet Jack, though I thought it would be much later.  There were two other central cast characters from Torchwood who made single-episode appearances, though in different (yet somewhat similar) roles; I will let this be a surprise for you.  From having watched Torchwood, I know at least one more cast member will appear, and I suspect two more may show up.<br /><br />EXTRAS<br /><br />Like Torchwood, there is an extra disk with 2+ hours of 12+ minute reviews of each episodes, with interviews of the actors, writers, producers, special effects people, and so on.  These are great fun after watching the series.  It really reminds me how great the series we just watched was, and provides some insight and some bits you may have missed.  Definitely recommended.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />My girlfriend is not often a fan of science fiction, but this is not the usual science fiction, and she likes this.  After watching the first season, we're both fans, and looking forward to more.and it's true, though it is generally as a result of problems he is trying to solve (that is, people are killed by aliens) or a sacrifice in the solution (people or aliens must die to solve the problem).

B004T2QZL8|1.0|Every time I play it has to down. It's annoying. I can't even play it. I don't want to say that I hate it but I do.
B00466HN72|5.0|Honestly, there are so many great things about it! It's a fine film for any age, with plenty of humor that is genuinely funny for adults as well as kids, and the adult humor is not inappropriate for the younger set. The animation is fantastic and fully believable in the real-world, the pacing is some of the best I've seen, and the human characters are beautifully cast and all excellently played as well. There is no forced romance with an unnecessary love interest, because they do the right thing (for once) and don't have an unnecessary love interest! Yes, this movie is totally safe for the lovelorn or those who just don't like seeing unnecessary romances in movies that aren't about that! What IS it about? It's an Easter movie! Yes, an actual Easter movie that isn't religious. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the religious Easter movies too, even if I'm not so religious anymore, but it's nice to have something to watch on Easter (feature-length, I mean) that gives us a break from the religious stuff and still is about the holiday. If you have kids, this movie should be a real Easter treat for them, but I don't have kids and still LOVE it. It's just so much fun, I can really relate to the lead human character (A LOT), and the Pink Berets, they are just too adorable! I want to hug them to death (well, maybe not to death), especially the little one, Bit! I had to get the figurines of all three of them!<br /><br />But, I'm getting ahead of myself here, let me give a little on the plot. \\"Hop\\" is a film about E.B. (Russell Brand), the son of the current Easter Bunny (Hugh Laurie), who would rather drum in a band than follow in his father's paw-prints. It's also about Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), a directionless young man who is being pushed by his family to find a job and get his own place, but who just can't stand to settle into a life that isn't amazing. Lucky for both Fred and E.B. that their paths cross when E.B. runs away from their Wonka-esque candy factory on Easter Island to pursue his dream in Hollywood! Unfortunately for E.B., his father sends his elite royal guards, the Pink Berets (three cuter than cute girl bunnies) to retrieve him, and even worse, the Easter Bunny's number one chick, Carlos, decides now is the perfect time to stage a takeover and become the new Easter... Chick!<br /><br />There's also one other huge aspect of the plot that I normally wouldn't give away, because it would normally be a huge spoiler. The big, surprise ending. However, if this film has any flaws, it's that this potential surprise ending is revealed at the beginning of the film, literally in the opening! Yeah, just like in the original Salem's Lot. I can't for the life of me understand why some films do this. So, it's no spoiler to say that in the end of the film, Fred becomes the new (and first human) Easter Bunny. Honestly, even when he comes up with the idea and E.B. starts training him in the hopes that they can switch places, so to speak, it still seems unlikely that things will turn out with Fred as the new Easter Bunny, but they don't get to surprise us with that great turnout because they revealed it in the opening credits narration. Oh well. So, yeah, this film isn't perfect, but that one, pretty silly move on the filmmakers' part is the only glaring mistake. Having said that, I do love the idea of how things worked out for Fred since it was done in a way to even satisfy those of us who were a little concerned about not having a rabbit in that sacred position.<br /><br />Now, some might say they should have at least given one nod to the religious aspects of Easter, and I'll agree that some sort of allusion could have done just a bit more to make this a perfect Easter film that doesn't miss a beat, but I can live with it being wholly secular since almost every other feature film related to Easter is wholly religious. Something that bothered me a little bit more (and, again, not much, and even less upon repeat viewings) were little Christmas similarities. Most significantly, the fact that the Easter Bunny drives a flying sleigh in this film (it looks very Easter-ish and is pulled by a flock of chicks, but still...). If they hadn't made a joke by calling out the chicks' names, Santa-style, at the end of the film, it wouldn't have bugged me so much. It just would have been nice to avoid any Christmas references in this Easter film (I love Christmas, but do the other holidays always have to bow down to it? I also get bugged when the other monsters are made to bow down to Dracula), but nevertheless, it is a fantastic film! Gotta watch this one once a year at the very least! Definitely a new favorite of mine!<br /><br />The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack gives perfect picture and sound, and a handful of extras. The most boasted of is an all-new Mini-Movie. Now, I highly recommend picking this up, because the movie is so fantastic and also because there aren't many movies out there for Easter anyway, even when you include holiday specials (my picks in that area being Charlie Brown and Rankin/Bass's original Here Comes Peter Cottontail). But, don't be swayed over the Mini Movie. That was lame. I mean, it was not like one of those bonus cartoons PIXAR adds to its releases. This was basically just Carlos and Phil, the two chicks from the film (and, all through this review, when I say chicks, I mean baby chickens, though these chicks are adults that permanently look like chicks), dancing on a while background. Seriously. It was like an animation test, really, not a mini movie. I was hoping it might be a new Pink Berets adventure, but no such luck. It was no kind of adventure at all, and Hank Azaria didn't even provide the voices this time. I could tell right away that Carlos was played by Jim Cummings in this short and elsewhere on the disc. The other bonus features were a mixed bag too. There is a collection of behind the scenes interviews that should have just been presented as one featurettes, preferably with more material, but it was a nice inclusion anyway. I don't care much for DVD games, but they do have a trio of decent ones for the kiddies here. There are also some special Blu-Ray enhancement gimmicks of the kind I usually don't bother with (BDLive and all that sort of thing). Too bad movies like this rarely get commentary tracks, and I didn't see the theatrical trailer or anything of that nature on the disc.

The world would benefit from her skills but first she has to get through college, good old boys, and ignorant idiots so her ideas can make a difference.<br /><br />The cinematography is designed to help the viewer get a glimpse into the way Temple may process information and events. Anyone who needs to understand autism should view this film. Anyone who wants to be a more sensitive human being when dealing with anyone who may be socially awkward should watch his movie. I teared up several times and was completely sucked into the drama of her struggle through college and the beginning of her career.<br /><br />Those sensitive to animal endangerment might want to consider that Temple's area of expertise is the design of humane slaughter houses. There is some footage that was fairly intense.
B0050G3NWG|2.0|This must be my first major disappointment for a vintage film transferred to Blu-ray. The presentation is superb of this WB \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" boxed set, BUT the quality of the picture is not nearly as good as my much earlier Region 1 Warner Bros.DVD set! As soon as the RKO logo came up I could see something was wrong. It was rather blurry and grainy as is much of the actual film itself. The DVD is sharp,contrasty and unblemished. In fact it looks like it was filmed yesterday. So what have WB done? Used the wrong print I should think! It does include however, a hardback book, repro of the original souvenir programme and more, but the most important thing, \\"the movie\\" does certainly not look as it should on Blu-ray. I'm mystified.

For those who don't like the fact that \\"underdogs and good guys don't win\\" or that their fave characters get the axe all I have to say is READ THE BOOKS. And it's refreshing to see a realistic look at the fact that the underdog usually doesn't win, the bad guy usually does prevail generally because he is the bad guy & willing to do ANYTHING to win...while good guys always have rules. Life isn't fair that is reality...well how refreshing that a series of books & a series tips it's hat to that fact. Do I like seeing my fave characters killed off? no but like I said life isn't fair. Trust me if the series sticks to the source material as closely as the 1st season has you'll be throwing your remotes through your tv's in seasons 3 and 4, trust me I threw the the books. So I say sit back & enjoy one of the the best if not the best fantasy series out there. I know I will....I'm seriously thinking of subscribing to HBO just for this series
B0059XTTW8|5.0|CAUTION:  If you are American, have not read the book, and you only want to watch this movie one time, you will find it to be the most boring, complicated, waste of time and money that you have ever spent on a movie.<br /><br />BECAUSE this film is extremely complicated, every word and second is important to following the story, which goes back and forth in time via flashbacks, and the British speak softly and mumble compared to Americans, so you'll be pulling your hair out, if you even stay with the entire film.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if you make it to the end, and watch it a second time, perhaps reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, and even the summaries of the characters from the book on Wikipedia, you will find this to be an excellent movie, if you like psychological (as opposed to action) thrillers, with fabulous acting, and many fascinating characters.<br /><br />I could not resist watching this on my ON DEMAND cable choices, and I'm glad I did it this way, because after the first viewing, which I watched with a friend (so a little chatting which doesn't work with a movie where every word and second and gesture is important) after a hard days work, and after the first run I thought it was absolutely horrible.  So I re-read the plot summary on Wikipedia and watched it again, and now I think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />And thanks to other fans of the beautiful song \\"La Mer\\" sung by Julio Iglesias, I can watch the last four minutes of this film (which are the very best) on YouTube for however long YouTube allows it to be shown!

B005K0HDGE|3.0|Stephen King is pretty much review-proof, so I won't spend a lot of words running down the aspects of this novel that didn't work for me. The high average ranking shows that most readers were on his wavelength and didn't mind (or didn't register) the anachronistic elements that crept into his characters' speeches, not to mention the slapdash construction of a several scenes that really needed a rewrite or, better, a complete reconsideration of whether they added anything to the smooth progress of the set of interlinking stories told here. Time travel stories require a particular level of insight and sophistication that strike me as missing from this book. For a really good time travel story, check out Tim Powers' \\"The Anubis Gates.\\"<br /><br />I go back and forth on King, who at his best is America's Dickens (long complex tales told through a huge set of well realized characters) and at his worst American's Bulwer-Lytton (\\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\"), a tedious hack who slathers words onto the page with a trowel and creates characters with no more differentiation that a bunch of cliches. Before this outing, \\"The Dome\\" had put him back in my good graces by virtue of being a contained, focused story where tensions and pressures on the lead characters ratcheted right up to a will-they-survive-or-will-they-not conclusion. \\"11/22/63\\" goes in too many different directions and introduces some dramatic threads that are there just because there is a tradition of parallelism, foreshadowing, and recollection in American novels. Grade C for vision, and another C for realization. On the other hand, there are reflective stretches where King abandons his characters for a while and just discourses on ideas of fate, free will, and causality. Those are the best parts of the book. His characters are not at their best when they are speaking or doing things. But when King lets then reflect on the reality that they are experiencing, or reflects on it for them in a way that lets thereader assign the musings to this character or that one, the book starts to fly. King definitely has an \\"A\\" game in him; he just needs to let it come out more often -- or force it do so.<br /><br />There was no chance that this book would displace the best Oswald novel from its top spot: \\"Libra\\" by Don DeLillo. To be fair, King is not writing a simple Oswald novel, but the story line to this book demands that the assassin be a bigger, better realized character than he actually is in these pages.<br /><br />Rossini said of Wagner's operas that they had some beautiful moments and some terrible half-hours. The same sort of judgment can be applied to King in general and this novel in particular.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|George Clooney is fantastic as a father in the middle of a crisis. Usually busy with work, after his wife's accident and subsequent coma, he finds himself in the role of primary parent. Both of his daughters are troubled and like most fathers faced with this, he is trying to fix them/the situation. The betrayal of his wife complicates things and creates the uniqueness of the film. Also going on is a piece of inherited family land on Kauai that is about to sold, making multiple cousins very rich (and Clooney controls the trust and the ultimate decision to sell or not).<br /><br />I loved this film so much as it is a unique perspective of a father and his two daughters, and the father being cheated on, not another movie of a mom and her children struggling after the husband cheated. This is by far Clooney's best film and it is easy to get caught up in his situation. I did not like the daughters the first time I saw this in the theater, it after watching it a second time, I understand. They are troubled and clearly have not had an involved parent in their lives.<br /><br />There are so many memorable scenes with extraordinary acting and beautiful scenery. Highly recommend watching this!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I do not usually write reviews about the books I read but this trilogy is just so refreshingly delicious. Christian Grey rich handsome powerful meets seemingly meek shy Anastaia Steele? Do not let the sexual lifestyle in this book cause you to dismiss it. This is a powerful story of love, commitment, sexual attraction, sexual frustration, compassion, patience and fortitude. While reading these books I have laughed, cried, been angry and turned on sometimes all at the same time.

0307956350|4.0|The heroine of Expats is a former CIA field agent who has traded a life of danger and physicality for the security of marriage, motherhood and domestic monotony. But when that security is threatened, she comfortably slips back into the clandestine persona that she has kept hidden from her family. The problem is, her husband may be keeping a secret of his own, one that could destroy everything that Kate cares about. Or is it the horrible event from her own past that is coming back to rob her of her second-chance existence? Kate is resourceful, but no Lara Croft. She has faults, makes mistakes. She loses fights. Well, a fight. I enjoyed this book very much. Kate and her husband are flawed but sympathetic, and I couldn't help but root for them. My one quibble: the action is far outweighed by lengthy descriptive passages. Too much \\"tell\\" and not enough \\"show.\\"

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Before I get into what I did not like, I will pay the book one compliment, it is technically well written. Beyond that this series has no redeeming value to anyone but a desperate housewife or naive young girl. Even the good writing is only due to the fact this series was edited by the same people who sis the twilight series. And speaking of Twilight that is exactly what you are holding in your hand. The author replaced a high school student with a college student and a vampire with a fraud of a \\"Bad boy\\"<br /><br />The plot, style, and characters absolutely reek of Twilight and I am surprised Meyers isn't suing unless of course she is getting a cut. This series is what is called fanfic. A story so obvious to the source it is nauseating. From the perspective of someone who has lived a BDSM lifestyle Gray is a joke and a fraud. He is scary to those who don;t know anything about the lifestyle and he is a lousy conflicted bad boy. Oh, he was a bused. So sad, so was I and I am a damn shade darker than anything that fraud could be.<br /><br />This book misses on every level except being a cash cow for a popular series. And those of us in the lifestyle know it will now create a group of vanilla women with a romanticized view of BDSM that does not exist. The author should be sued not complimented
B004ECDNJU|4.0|I have really enjoyed this puzzle game. think of fire going through a pipe. You can rotate certain spots of the \\"pipe\\" to make the fire change directions. Your goal is to get the correct color to end up at the correct end of the pipe. I enjoy both timed levels and endless mode. I just wish there were more levels/puzzles to complete. Hoping for more to come!
1741798981|4.0|Lonely Planet publishes a whole series of travel guides for locations throughout the world. One of their recent guides, new for 2012, is a book on London with extended East London coverage. Publication of the revised 2012 edition released in February was timed for the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London.<br /><br />The 8th edition of Lonely Planet's London travel guide includes 45 pages of color maps, a list of 53 museums in London, and 64 different regional cuisines for the palate that craves diversity. The guide itself sells for $19.99 and Lonely Planet offers the option of buying pdf chapters at $4.95 each that can be loaded into e-readers, tablets or laptops for more convenient use while travelling. Lonely Planet also makes its travel guides available as e-books formatted for Kindle, Nook, Kobo and iPad readers.<br /><br />It's a good thing the London guide has been updated and a revised edition issued because past users have complained of the previous guide being out-of-date, containing bad prices, and other information that didn't pan out. The only problem I had with the new guide is I couldn't find my hotel listed anywhere. Still I found the guide to be helpful, informative, and good reading.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|Overall the sound quality of the headset I would rate it about 7/10 but the product quality overall sucks. I actually have 2 units. The 1st one, I've used it for almost a year and the sound on the right ear piece just stopped working. I have no idea what went wrong, anyway I went and buy another one, as I was happy with the sound quality. Less than a year (bought it in June 2011), the same thing happened. The sound for the right ear piece went dead again. I've checked the wiring and tried it on my friend's PS3 and it wasn't working as well. Overall I will stop buying Turtle Beach headsets. Because of the the 1st unit breaking down on me, I took extra precaution on the 2nd unit and the same thing happened..
1451683405|5.0|I got this book to include in my collection of the rest of Sam Harris' book, and I do not regret it.

1451627289|5.0|I've been reading King's books since the 70s. I've pretty much read them all. Some I love, some not so much. I have a tendency to really hate the way he ends a book. He gets so much momentum going throughout his books that most of the time the endings are a let down.<br /><br />Not so with this one. 11/22/63 is a great read from start to finish. I was so totally emotionally drained by the end of this book that I wept like a baby. Hats off to you Mr King and keep them coming!
B003EYVXV4|1.0|Well, I'm going to be in the lonesome minority here. First of all, I loved the book.  And generally speaking, movies don't live up to the content of a novel, so I didn't go into the theater with insurmountable expectations.  But the film was so choppy and the characters so underdeveloped, I couldn't understand how a movie that was as greatly anticipated by the public as this one could fall into the hands of such an incompetent director.<br /><br />SPOILERS - The beginning of the movie shows Katniss, acting in an over-motherly manner of soothing Prim after a bad dream.  Had I not read the book, there would have been nothing to establish that uncomfortable, almost compulsive show of affection.  A better beginning would have been to show the father's death, the mother's inability to cope, then Katniss taking over responsibility and support of both mother and sister, thereby establishing that role.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found instances like that throughout the movie.  It was like reading a book where the author tells instead of builds a story by showing.  ---Another glaring example, was Cinna.  In the book, we watch the relationship between him and Katniss grow.  In the movie, we're expected to believe he likes Katniss simply because he says he does.  Again, no foundation there.<br /><br />Except for the action in the Games, and enough coverage between Katniss and Rue to finally give me a reason to actually like Katniss, so little time was devoted to developing the characters and establishig the reasons they related to one another the way they did, I felt as though the script was little more than a factual account of scenes to be acted.  Leaving the theater, it was as though only half the story had been imparted.<br /><br />The absolute worst, however, was the unbelievably amateurish filming.  Right from the beginning, the cameras seemed to jerk this way, then that, as though uncertain of where to focus and settle.  Everything was filmed way too close, as well---again, forcing the lens to jerk from one thing to another, to another, instead of allowing the viewer the comfort of watching it as an uninterupted whole.  About a third of the way into the movie, I realized I felt nauseous and didn't understand why.  Two-thirds into it, I spent a fair amount of time looking down at my lap.  And during the last third, I had to pick my moments of glancing up at the screen.  Twice on the way home I wondered if I was going to have to pull over and be sick, then went directly to bed as soon as I got there.<br /><br />For such a moving, well thought-out book, the writer(s) and director of the movie chopped it to bits.  In the hands of someone else, it could have been a masterpiece.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|This movie is definitely worth seeing if you're a Jane Austen fan.  While there were modifications to the story for screenplay purposes, overall the movie kept to the spirit of the book.  Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones were great as the lead characters.  You get involved with the story because they reflect the emotions of Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth very well. These characters are among Jane Austen's best.  There are a few scenes between Sally and Rupert that have such great romantic tension that you can watch them again and again. I rated this movie 4 out of 5 stars because the ending seemed a bit rushed, with Anne running through the streets of Bath.  However, that is the only reason. This romantic period piece movie was well done. I look forward to Amazon selling a blu-ray version.
054531058X|1.0|I just picked up the book after hearing all the hype about it because of the movie and hoped to read a fast paced gripping piece of sci fiction.  I wasn't expecting genius, depth, just some light entertainment.  I thought it might be like an Ender's Game - a fun and tantalizing if ridiculous scenario, some interesting characters, and a good flow.I was sorely disappointed.  How this book bored me to death - I do not want to count the ways.  It reminded me of the PSP video games my nephews plays endlessly. Fun tantalizing if ridiculous scenarios, full of  killing but insipidly flat paced, repetitive, and sanitized of any real emotion.

I am so glad I gave it another chance because it got really good and I so<br />fell in love with all the characters.  I finished it in a day and a half and cried like a baby in the<br />end.  My whole family has now read the book and loved it, we are passing it along to friends.
B000002MTR|4.0|1995's, One Hot Minute, was the Peppers first c.d. since 1991's Blood sugar magic.<br /><br />  Most of the songs, are good. Aeroplane, was one of the hits, from One Hot Minute. It is also one of my favorite songs by them.I like the song My Friends, it has a classic rock, feel to it.<br /><br />  The c.d. is kind of weird. Original gutarist John Frusciante at the time, was kicked out of the band for drug addiction problems. Dave Navaro, from Janes Addiction, became there gutarist, for One Hot Minute.<br /><br />  The first single Warped, was different and takes sometime to get use to. So do songs like Walkabout, Tearjerker, and One Big Mob.
0439023491|2.0|Often when novelists trying to create a strong female character, they often add a bit of a craziness in them. This is understandable approach for female characters since women often draw their strength from their emotions such as love. As a result, we end up with bunch of female protagonists who are in various state of hysteria. In effort of making them real and strong, the authors often achieve in making them mad with love or grief, and emotion becomes their strength and excuses of making stupid decisions.<br /><br />While, Hunger game is different. The book did a very good job in creating one of my favorite female characters: Katniss. She's strong, realistic, and driven by the most primal instinct of survival. Like other female characters, she drew her strength from emotion, love towards her sister and family, her hatred towards the capital. All make her a very interesting antihero, who would do anything to survive while still remain true to her humanity.<br /><br />But Book 2 of Hunger Game took a sharp turn for the worst. Katniss, once so strong and resilient, become stupid and hysterical. It is as if the author don't know how to make of this character so she start to try out different common adolescent themes. Katniss is very confused, she didn't know what to do. At one chapter she's back to her old self-preservative self; suddenly page turned she decided to become a martyr. At one chapter she decided she love Gale with all her heart, the next she's willing to die for Peeta. I always understand Katniss has a lot of hatred, which is part of her personality. But getting to the end of the book, she doesn't even know where to direct her anger. She's angry with everyone for no particular reason. She changed from a smart, strong young woman with good conscience into a hysterical mad woman who do stupid things for stupid reason (or no reason at all).<br /><br />Once again, author falls into the old cliche of female character creation, using unchecked emotion as motivation and explanation, having character do stupid things to drive the story. I mourn for Katniss, who is utterly destroyed in book 2.<br /><br />The plot also suffers from the general confusion of the book. the first half and the second half couldn't be too far away from each other. The plot twist feels forced. I personally feel that the only reason President Snow come up with the plan is because the author don't know what else to write other than a bigger more twisted hunger game. Overall, the story is such a drag. I read every word in book one, but skip lines in book 2. The endless whine of Katniss is absolutely unbearable. If character development and various interesting supporting characters save the plot, the character development in second book is weak. I can't believe author start introduce some of the major characters in second half of the book!<br /><br />I'm very disappointed at book 2, but since the ending is a cliffhanger, I end up buying book 3 nonetheless. Might as well finish it.tion and explanation, having character do stupid things to drive the story.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|If you are a die-hard fan of The Godfather trilogy, this bluray is the version is the one for you. The picture quality, sound and extras are just outstanding. But The Godfather is much more than its production values. Few movies have a screenplay that is powerful enough to explore character, motivation, the subtleties of personal (as well as public vengeance) played against an internal drama of yearning for self-renewal and restoration as this epic saga succeeds in doing. It's a movie to watch again and again, each time viewing it differently than the last. Simply outstanding.

0609610570|4.0|Bossidy and Charan dive into the critical gap of getting things done in this management classic. Focused on execution, the authors discuss the critical components for leadership within an execution/get stuff done environment. Pointing out the failures of hands off management, ivory tower thinking and micromanagement, the emphasis is on those critical elements that combine the what needs to be done and who needs to do it to execute on a business strategy or operational plan.<br /><br />The critical linking of strategy, operations and people is the role of the business leader, and in order to accomplish that critical mission, the leader must be meaningfully involved in those three elements - not micromanaging them, but leading them to efficient execution. The leader's most important job is the selection and appraising of the people in the organization, and this element should consume the bulk of their efforts and should never be delegated. The leader must embrace this role and thrive in it to ensure proper execution of the strategy and operations.<br /><br />The combination of people and strategy lead to an operating plan, in which the execution takes place. This plan needs to be realistic, ambitious, resourced, specific and accountable. The authors note that this piece is often the art that falls short - where the operating plan is divorced from the strategy and people - and the execution suffers.<br /><br />The book has critical questions and suggestions for the leader, and provides a platform for thought that is focused on getting things done rather than just the what and who theory of planning. An important read.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|Perhaps being a full time writer is some kind of a terrible curse which prevents a person to tell a story in an honest and uncompromising way. The way of kings is approximately voluminous as The lord of the rings, former with just a tiny fraction of substance as the later. Almost nothing happens in The way of kings, just a glimpse of a true story. There are at lest five pointless pov's, spawned solely to stretch the plot and artificially create so called page-turner. The two essential arcs (Kaldin, Shallan) are in large part wasted on a weak and unconvincing psychological/philosophical struggle and on reminiscence of the past events that are easily deducible. What a shame.<br /><br />However, this book is not bad: the writing is fluid, descriptions are vivid, the arcane system is interesting and refreshing, though slightly similar to the one introduced in the Mistborn trilogy.

0312330537|5.0|At first it seems just a long quite realistic diary of an Australian fugitive in India. Then, one realizes that Roberts knows literary techniques. There are brilliant thrillers and lovely surprises. Finally, one finds that the people are much more than adventure characters. Gangsters are philosophers. Inhabitants of poor villages are poets. Carnal and platonic love coexists. After 800 pages, the end seems premature. The only bad feeling is the sensation of precocious ending.

B000EHNEDO|4.0|How many remember Val Kilmer was the erstwhile hero of this flick?  I do!  A story of true heroism and values as only the Renaissance can portray.  Willow's conscience does not permit him to abandon a baby who comes to his family by a fateful encounter.  It turns out that this baby is the prophesied star to undo the evil Queen.  I loved the story as a young woman and love it still to share with my grandson.
1400069289|3.0|This book talks around the issues of behavioral therapy and the use of Antecedent-Behavior-Consequences training. I liked the stories, but was disappointed by the avoidance of any mention of B.F. Skinner. If you are hoping that you will use this book to either form new habits or break old ones, you will have to be terribly resourceful to achieve that.<br /><br />You will do better to see the books by Aubrey Daniels or others in Performance Management if you hope to achieve something with your habits.<br /><br />This book suffers from an liberal leaning bias that prevents the author from mentioning the leaders in this field or using the terminology of the applied behavior analysis and management.<br /><br />It is an entertainment, not a lesson.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is in reply to all the \\"how can you enjoy the killing of children\\" posts. The answer is: you aren't meant to enjoy these books. You should not enjoy the killing of children. It is supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to make you think and to feel and to engage. If you read it you will hate the tyrannical society that forces these children into battle. And if you keep reading until the end of the series you would rejoice when that tyranny is ended-- while feeling sorrow at the huge cost of that victory. But as an adult you understand that easy victories aren't realistic or lasting. That it takes blood and tears and heart to win any fight worth winning. And sacrifice. And that's what this series is about: sacrifice for the greater good. And how it can go horribly wrong, or horribly right. But that in the end, it's about which horror you can live with. And that's why these books are literature to me. And why I am never surprised that people hate them. Because they think they are supposed to enjoy them. You aren't. You are supposed to experience them. And that's not for everyone.<br /><br />Like someone else said, they are incorrectly billed as teen books. That doesn't mean teens won't appreciate them. Some might, but the subject matter is intense and they are more correctly viewed as literature and for adult sensibilities.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I think this film is GREAT. It is as big as life and just as true. Filled with all of the emotions that accompany life, love and death. I have paid to see it several times. The story really hit home for many of us in Hawaii. Not only was it an authentic view of what goes on, it was a view into the concerns we have for our sacred land and development that is all about personal greed and money. It was also an authentic look into the plight of our American youth who seem to have little respect for authority as there is often no one in authority for them to respect. What about the kids of the future? Shouldn't they have places to camp?

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey second season follows Downton Abbey first season. It is a superb, wonderful well scripted, beautifully photographed, with significant period detail and well-acted. Once you begin Downton Abbey the actors and story line pulls you in to where you feel part of their lives. There is a thin line between those who are served and those who serve. This drama portrays the transition between late 1800s and early 1900s. A time when electricity was brought into homes, first automobiles were used, followed by telephone, and First World War. First World War was devastating to England, France, Germany and ultimately United States. This story gives us a glimpse into England during this crucial period.[[ASIN:B005Q1W0ZQ Downton Abbey: Season 2 (Original U.K. Edition) [Blu-ray]]]
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|As others have stated, the product is well built for this price. The basic setup is straightforward. The problem comes when trying to achieve the perfect balance needed for it to work. I was trying to balance my Panasonic GH2, a very small camera. To make the story short, I couldn't manage after at least 20 hours of trying. No matter what i tried, something was off always. At this point, perhaps, it is me, perhaps it is the product, perhaps it is the camera. Perhaps all of the above. I honestly don't know.<br /><br />My hands-on experience is that the balance is so delicate and needs so much precision that it is a waste of money and time. For example: using a zoom lense is out of the question becuase the extending of the lens will immediately alter the balance. Even auto-focusing with a prime lens will have an effect. And every time you need to re-calibrate, it is back to spending at least 30 minutes (according to most successful users online). Wind makes the devise useless, too. And let's not talk about bumping into people/objects after spending hours on calibration, adding a mic or flash or something else...<br /><br />I should mention that the product comes without instructions and there is no video/manual online from the manufacturer.<br /><br />So, too many limitations for a hobbyist like me. Perhaps real professionals will have more of an incentive to deal with the pain - but I also imagine real pros will probably have more sophisticated equipment than a GH2 and a $200 stabilizer.<br /><br />My solution? For hand-held shots, I just bought a pistol grip ($14.00) and a square flash bracket (that doubles as a Microphone stand - $10) and I'm getting very decent video without the pain, time and expense. These units seem to require a small dose of masochism on the operator's part. I'm returning mine. The 3 stars are in recognition of the product's excellent construction and the fact that others more talented or more patient than me *may* find it very valuable. YMMV.<br /><br />Review edit on April 5th, 2012:<br /><br />I'd like to mention that seller - 47th St Photo - spontaneously contacted me and provided a full refund, assuring me that their top priority is to keep customers happy. Well, I'm one now! Sorry the product does not work for me, but at least I can shop knowing I'm dealing with a fair, trustworthy merchant!

B0060AY6FO|2.0|The tenor of Austen's work, while passably imitated here, does not lend itself to murder investigations and suspense of this visceral type. IN short, the work cheapened Austen's Pride and Prejudice and tried to send up Darcy while pulling punches.
030746363X|2.0|I got way too much information than I wanted on information that I didn't want.  Where are the meal plans and recipes? I wanted help planning my diet and got information on sexual positions! I am very disappointed with this book.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|An obviously enjoyable book, judging from the rave critics reviews and movie release, but empty, formulaic, predictable and cliche'.<br />1) The characters are not faced with truly moral decisions, the bad guys are bad, the good guys are good, and the main character never encounters a moral dilemma. I hoped that the plot device would give an opportunity to explore human nature, virtue, courage, desperation etc. But it fails. There is no valid exploration of human nature.<br />2) As mentioned by many others, the plot is derived from \\"Battle Royale\\" Not a problem in itself, except that \\"Hunger Games\\" fails to adequately justify its plot devices.<br />3) The convenience of medicines that magically appear, and rules that spontaneously change do not lend to a suspension of disbelief. These events are contrived.<br />4) It would have been much more enjoyable not to work in a love story.<br />5) Whatever social commentary the author strives for, it is utterly lost. The dystopian society of the \\"Hunger Games\\" is so alien that there is little in the book that lends to reflection.<br />6) Reviews praise her writing style, but she uses many cliche's and fails to paint an original vivid narration.<br />7) None of the characters truly contemplate the moral outrage of the central plot device. This is the elephant in the room. Even in Roman times, the merits of the arena were debated.<br /><br />With that said, I can believe that she intentionally paints her characters as shallow, one-dimentional, insecure and media-obsessed (Katniss is always worried about how people will perceive her \\"performance\\" in the hunger games) as a means to lambast the idiocy of reality television. There is a veiled allegory of how television viewers in the United States are entertained by watching people exploit themselves on national television. The lack of any truly deep questioning by any of the characters is in some way reflective of how television viewers today don't have any moral compunction about viewing similarly exploitive reality television.<br /><br />In short, throughout the whole book I hoped it would redeem itself in some way. It failed to do so. I jumped on the bandwagon because my friends were all about it, but will need some persuasion to read the sequels.
B002MTTZ5I|4.0|I've been in the music business for over 30 years. I discovered SP through an article in Guitar World magazine. I LOVE Steel Panther...love the videos, love the musicianship, love MOST of the humor (except when it gets too graphic or gross..like \\"The Shocker\\" or racist like \\"Asian Hooker\\". They must be managing themselves because no manager in his right mind would let them limit their commercial potential so severely with their constant use of profane lyrics and sexual themes. That Parental Advisory sticker keeps them OFF the radio, OFF of TV, and OUT of polite society, and consequently, OUT of the \\"BIG DOUGH\\". And that's fine if you just want to have fun, and play to a very small audience of teenage boys and small clubs like House of Blues, and you can be content with that. Bit it's kind of a shame that you will never reach the big audience you COULD reach if you just cleaned it up a bit.I'm not Tipper Gore..by \\"clean it up\\" I mean substitute words the four letter words with any one of 1000 less rude euphamisms. I also think SP should ditch songs like \\"Asian Hooker\\" and \\"The Shocker\\" for reasons I already explained or, at least, tone it down....you are not going to get media attention in a GOOD way if you come off racist and misogynist UNLESS it's pretty obvious that you are KIDDING, OK? let me repeat that..KIDDING, OK? It's a very fine line between humorous and offensive and SP crosses that line too often. Seen Andrew Dice Clay lately? Just my two cents...SP could be doing everything they are doing now but have a HUGE audience instead of a small cult following if they just toned it down a notch. You don't surrender your artistic integrity by dumping songs about sticking your pinky in some girl's nether parts. But if you want to relegate your music to relative obscurity....keep up the gratuitous profanity and gross themes.

As a brain injury nurse, he has not embelished on the patient's course of recovery. His medical facts and descriptions of a post-traumatic brain injury patient are spot on. I cannot say enought about this book--my favorite this year! Can't wait for his next book. I encourage you to read this captivating novel.

B0000797IO|5.0|Very often actresses stay away from realistic films,especially lower class<br />dramas of life,dark and somber. Jennifer in this piece plays the role different than i expect and i was thrown off at first but then i saw where the drama was going. At first we are introduced to budding novelist with the Salinger name of the classic american nover cathcher in the rye,probably the most well known,though short,novels of modern america. This type of character which not only is a source of drama but evokes commentary throughout is interesting,and he leads the character into a series of scenes adultery(where she is never<br />emotionally/sensitively involved,which is why the director expends explicit scenes showcasing them). The film shoots like a play,ideas of being cuckolded<br />and the dreary effects of urbanization around the focal point of a walmart type<br />establishment,which like in the novel Dickens Hard Times wears down on the characters as they become increasingly alienated and have little inner life<br />or values,just parts of the environment,except the male character which shows some life but is done away with at the end and is thought to be crazy(or<br />perhaps too sane). The one part of the film i did like was the attempt to<br />show christian revival as a counterpoint to what's draining much of life in<br />the modern world...but it never really gets anywhere and the characters dont<br />seem that interested,and the spouse of Jennifer seems antagonized by the nazarene character and his wife's feelings for him,that's what occupies these<br />crudish male characters their wives personal feelings and bonds to other men,<br />which they can never quite deal with,and their is good drama about a romance<br />among friends. A dark comedy of modern life,bringing up old themes in the<br />fictional world of st catharines a small towm representing small town<br />characters,the one star,and the inability of the characters to impose change<br />on their environment,and they become sticks and driven like the wind by their<br />stimulus-response type reaction not only to sex, but everything,the director or<br />writer comments on characters with little mental life,sensualist at the<br />core and completely conditioned by their environment, making them what they are.<br />Of all the actresses films,and i'm one of those old fashioned critics who<br />likes virtuous females not succumbing so much to their environs and having<br />some inner resilience,for that reason i like this role least,although her<br />acting is good and so is the film,it has a depressing aura around  it true to<br />life though it is. All to true...the characters resemble all too frankly what<br />is wrong in our own haunted worlds,spectors and cuckolds like the holloween<br />imagery,and our failure is that they so dominate our worlds to the neglect and solace of the revival spirit which is quenched like all redeeming values in this<br />excellent art like film. The actress offers a very good commentary on this film<br />which shows her excedding and illuminating the bounds of conventions,although<br />I like her roles in other films. I've seen this film a few times,and it had a good run.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|I came across this interesting singer,and she is from the backwoods around<br />where i reside for the present, I dont quite find the music punky and i listen to the music about getting me what i want,the world falling to pieces,and happy ending things slipping away...there seems to be a thread here about finding<br />a bond in relationships,finding some semblance of what's missing there? Although I cant really say there's romance here,about feelings here and there?<br />Solitude is something hard to bear,and the idea of being small overwhelmed<br />by the world,which can get the best of anyone...and finding some locale and<br />peace of mind and company,,for the journey. Interesting lyrics and i liked the accompanying music,of course she's gotten a bad rap in ways judging from the press,but she's not the first rock artist to suffer that fate...but the lyrics<br />are free from any politicizing and she is doing well...so i ll come across her again in future cds.

B003K025V4|4.0|I recall yours ago in my younger years,a very child aged shirley temple in her<br />prime as a child actress,although i've not seen any of her films,belt out those cute songs in her child like voice...and its interesting knowing singers in their younger get ups as they age and we see them in later years in more adult wardrobe and getups,and a more seductive voice. The child like image is shed,<br />which we who saw her in her younger years,like a snake's outworn skin and in leather type apparel she appears clad in a black leather outfit..in modern<br />view shedding everything getting in the way of what this cd is about...being a young free person i think,elaborating on what her heart is all about. So from child to young adult, musing on themes as liberty walk,where freedom reigns loving and being loved and many type songs in that refrain. I liked this cd,<br />and the them is a modern one,encompassing her new look and image,and my<br />favorite song is \\"permament  december\\" with its european settings and new found<br />yearnings. Of course the child like image is gone,and that old voice from long ago and many of the lush type settings of that disney tv show replaced with a new voice and look...good stuff and we look forward to her next cd...and i wonder what theme that will express?
B003EYVXVE|5.0|I have never read the books, but I knew enough about them to know this isn't at all like that Twilight garbage. The Hunger Games appeals to both genders and all ages. Hundreds of years in the future, one girl and boy ages 12-18 are chosen from each of the 12 Districts to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games. This is punishment for a rebellion that happened in the past when the capital was attacked by \\"lower\\" peoples. The capital city has all the money and power, so every District is poor and low on food.<br /><br />The acting is very good all around, with Jennifer Lawrence stealing the show as Katniss Everdeen. She is tough, smart and a character the audience has no problem rooting for. Woody Harrelson has his fair share of funny lines as her mentor. Elizabeth Banks hides behind some hideous make-up and costumes, which made for a memorable character. Even Lenny Kravitz shows up in a small role.<br /><br />The action scenes are not really as graphic as they should be (PG-13 of course), but they do show the kids being killed in quick cuts and sometimes even a few splashes of blood. After a nice build up, it's not quite as thrilling as it could have been once the games start, but I never checked my watch once and the 2 and 1/2 hours flew by.<br /><br />After making 70 million dollars on Friday alone, I will be looking forward to the next two installments.<br /><br />I'm going to check out the Japanese film called Battle Royale (2000), which is nearly the same thing, but with a hard R rating. The author of The Hunger Games claims she never saw that movie, thus she didn't rip-off from it.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|One of the things I liked about the trilogy was how the action kept my hands glued to my Kindle. The story is told in an exciting style, that keeps you reading, although it is at times rather too predictable. I also liked that the general story was less stereotypical than many of the action books.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is some level of predictability that lessened its charm. Whenever Katniss runs into trouble what I wonder is not whether, but how she will get out of it. Same goes for Peeta. So the suspense was not that high - and now I am thinking about the George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series; that one really takes suspense to another level.<br /><br />Katniss, as well, is a bit too standard for my taste. I wish more action-story characters varied from the stern but with a great soul type of hero; who got through terrible hardship and suffering and put on this tough mask, for protection; who hardened their shell, but suffering and nobleness boil inside; who gets to be the key to the salvation of... you name it, but make it big and important. Something like John McClane in Die Hard :).<br /><br />That being said, there is some more complexity to Katniss and I liked it. I also liked how the trilogy ends. That one is less predictable. Can't write about it, of course, but I found it fitting.<br /><br />So overall an enjoyable read. I rated it with 4 stars because I would rather keep 5 for my favourites.

B006LEHOL2|4.0|Sinead O'Connor. Likely one of the most reviled and revered pop stars of our time. It pains me to think of all the window shoppers who jumped on the \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" bandwagon back in 1990. That's not where my O'Connor journey began. You see I was a keen observer and in January 1988 I watched this video for \\"Mandinka\\" and that's when I became a fan. It did not faze me a bit that she did not want the American National Anthem played before her show (I mean she didn't have any country's national anthem played before her shows, so who cares, right?) It excited me to see her rip up a picture of the pope not because I had anything against the man, but religion is a coping crutch just like alcohol, drugs or anything else that assures people that their lives mean something. It is/was true that the Catholic church was harboring sex offenders, so her point was well made.<br /><br />Her politics and antics aside, what has always resonated with me is her vocals and her lyrics. She is one of the rarest of artists who can strike a nerve with her ability to emote as evidenced on \\"Mandinka\\", \\"Three Babies\\", \\"Black Boys On Mopeds\\", \\"This Is To Mother You\\" and now \\"Queen Of Denmark\\". She exorcises herself when she is at her best, and she hasn't been this good since 2000's \\"Faith And Courage\\". Her last three albums being mostly mediocre covers and some originals.<br /><br />This new album is a solid 10 song set with several directly felt lyrics in songs such as \\"Reason With Me\\" in which she recounts trying to intervene with a lifelong junkie, \\"Old Lady\\" in which she recounts how when she's older she'll be more appreciated, \\"Queen Of Denmark\\" in which she angrily spits about being jilted (the only cover song here), \\"I Had A Baby\\" in which it feels so autobiographical as she remembers getting knocked up and let go, producing a child, and \\"V.I.P.\\" in which she slams popular culture of the day and asks who are we to label ourselves v.i.p.'s?<br /><br />Musically, this is the most rocking and balladeering O'Connor has likely been since 1994's \\"Universal Mother\\". Surely, this is one of her finest records and deserves to be heard rather than relegated to the bottom of the 2012 dust bin.<br /><br />No matter how confused, or how disturbed she may actually be in real life, she retains something as a musical artist that is to be cherished and preserved. After all, there are but a few that can sing like O'Connor, and all of her dysfunction is miraculously channeled into something functional when it comes to her pop music. Every season I have watched \\"American Idol\\" I think to myself, \\"There's no one like Sinead O'Connor\\" and \\"All all of these girls are sissies compared to Sinead O'Connor\\".<br /><br />Glad to have you back where you belong. Here's how \\"How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?\\" compares with her previous works:<br /><br />1987 The Lion and the Cobra: Four Stars<br />1990 I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got: Five Stars<br />1992 Am I Not Your Girl?: Two and a Half Stars<br />1994 Universal Mother: Four and a Half Stars<br />1997 Gospel Oak [EP]: Four Stars<br />2000 Faith and Courage: Four and a Half Stars<br />2002 Sean Nos-Nua: Three Stars<br />2003 She Who Dwells: Four Stars<br />2005 Collaborations: Two and a Half Stars<br />2005 Throw Down Your Arms: Three Stars<br />2007 Theology: Three Stars<br />2012 How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?: Four and a Half Starscking and balladeering O'Connor has likely been since 1994's \\"Universal Mother\\".

B006C5FWH8|5.0|This is a great old-school rpg. Trese Brothers is a great developer.  They support all of their apps tremendously and are constantly adding new content and graphical updates. Definitely worth the $$. If you are doubtful, try the free version first. You'll be hooked and want all the features of the full version :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. If you only watch the movie, you are missing a lot. When I finished the book, I was not totally convinced that I needed to read the next two, but my friends highly recommended them. This book can stand alone, but what it really does is set the stage for what is to come.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Seemingly about a single book, then gradually sweeping further into the past to encompass all the works of a single author, this haunting story links past tragedy to the present as certain events seem destined to repeat themselves. Set in Barcelona, the feel of the city, its neighborhoods, and especially the darkened streets and a certain deserted mansion, envelope the reader. The action begins quickly, then slows (as the reader wonders where the book is leading), then gathers itself for the denouement. Cruelty, selfishness, arrogance are set against compassion, love and the stubborn will to follow a story to its end. Finally, a beautiful love story. The book stays in your mind.

B007MNV5WU|1.0|I paid .99 when I bought this for my phone and now you want to charge me $2.99 more to play it on my Fire?! I would understand having to pay again if I had originally bought it from Google Play or even if both devices were registered to different accounts.  That isn't the case though and I feel very cheated!

0743277708|5.0|Others have said it perfectly well, so I will be brief:<br /><br />This book is excellent.<br />It is a novel of adventure, of introspection, of supernatural intervention, with a love story involved.<br /><br />The characters include:<br />A prophet<br />A thinking hero<br />A classic, herculean hero<br />A charismatic villain who had a chance to show himself to be a visionary hero and just misses<br />A tragic character<br />A strong female character who is also a prophet<br />A wanderer from far away<br /><br />The story has humor, horror, adventure and perils-of-Pauline type suspense.<br />The story has classical mythology interspersed in the story and foreshadowing the action.<br /><br />The chapters have headings that add to the enjoyment: O my godda bless!  Never I see such-a people!<br /><br />It is absorbing, but you can read it in small sips over the course of a summer; it has substance and a reader can return to it after a hiatus.<br /><br />AND: (get this)<br /><br />I forgot it was about rabbits.  It was as heroic,  heartbreaking and enthralling as anything I've read and loved.  It's on  my permanent shelf.
B004SBX112|5.0|The most challenging Angry Birds thus far.  It's great because it's Angry Birds, but it is extrememly challenging to get past some levels let alone 3 stars on said levels.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've been following EL James on her journey, from Fan Fiction extrodinair all the way to her Twilight characters changing from Edward Cullen and Bella Swan to Christain Gray and Anastatia Steele. I have to admit, the transition took a few reads getting used to, but the journey from fanfic queen to actual author was worth the wait for this extraordinary tale of fear, self loathing, love, and unconventionally hot sex. She turned a bunch of normal women like me into kinky chicks, lusting for more then the norm. Just ask our bemused, happy husbands. *tee hee*
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Waiting for more from this author.  This is the type of book that you want to share with all your friends.

B0012K1ILW|3.0|I don't normally post reviews on Amazon, but I just heard Ramp's \\"The American Promise\\" from \\"Come Into Knowledge\\" .. and here I was thinking Erykah's opening track \\"Amerykahn Promise\\" was original.  I'm all for sampling, but she basically lifted the entire track wholesale, with a bit of improvising over the top.  This is just really lazy.. sorry Erykah, but really?  The production on this is also too dense, it needs to be pared back to the rimshot n' bass simplicity of her earlier, classier work.

B006T5LGXA|5.0|Alice Cooper always delivers live and this is no exception.  Killer set list that flows wonderfully, all key points in Coopers career are touched on which is a real treat for fans as he has a vast library of amazing music.  I'm not sure what the other reviewer was expecting, maybe a lip sync or live in studio with band aids!??  Alice does not need it and holds his own with this set.  Money well spent, and a great fan treat from the shock rock master.

B00026WU82|5.0|From the snare that opens Like a Rolling Stone to the last blow of the harmonica on<br />Desolation Row, Dylan has never made an album like Highway 61 Revisited and one would<br />be a fool to try and replicate the album; as an achievement and as a piece of music.<br />There are those who would disagree, but I would argue with them the same way as any<br />sensible person would; to ask them to listen to it. Not song by song, but as a whole.<br />Take a day off, hell even a week. You wouldn't run out of things to discover if you did.<br />There are things being done on this record which hadn't been done then, and won't be done<br />now; take the wonderful glassy tone of \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", or the manic blues<br />and organ playing on \\"Tombstone Blues\\". These songs can't be replaced by anything now,<br />digital just won't cut it. Even vaccuum tubes won't cut it; these songs have a sound<br />and a story all their own, and it's pointless to continue making music after something like<br />this. It's too unique to try. The wonderful thing about it is, nowadays, being different means<br />being unpleasant; but the songs in Highway 61 Revisited plug into both your ears and pour<br />dreams into them, with all their confusion and familiarity contrasted with each other.<br />Buy it. Your life might change.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Awesome! Simple, but tests your minds. Probably best puzzle game! Good job Rovio! But sometimes it freezes. But it so good, I give it 5 stars.
B000002C2E|5.0|This album is one of the best Dylan albums there is; better than 'classics' like Desire for sure.<br />Now, before spit and fists fly at the fact I would probably rate this as Dylan's sixth best album,<br />take into account that the quality of Dylan's songs do not derive from his singing, the band's playing,<br />or any factors relating to the 'sound.' Dylan's songs derive their worth from the quality of the songwriting,<br />and pretty much that alone. With that in mind, the songs on this album like 'Standing in the Doorway', 'Tryin<br />to get to Heaven', 'Not Dark Yet', are all different to Dylan's previous writing, but no less honest and<br />seemingly universal in the ways in which they can be related. Not to mention 'Make You Feel My Love', which<br />while sparse (like much of the album, both lyrically and instrumentally) is still very accessible as Adele's<br />cover of the song has helped to show. On this album, Dylan, probably the inventor of the 'literary pop song'<br />reinvents the song for the late 1990s. Sure, the instrumentation now feels dated 15 years later, but that doesn't<br />change the fact that this is an essential part of a Dylan fan's library.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. There is not one song on the CD that I don't like. Bruno Mars is a truly talented artist.

B003EYVXV4|3.0|In the far future, twelve to seventeen year olds are sent to the arena to fight to the death for the TV audiences. Twenty-four kids go, one comes home to riches. Sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen is a illegal poacher and good with a bow. She might just have a chance.<br />This is a action movie similar to Gladiator, and the TV shows Survivor and Big Brother.<br /><br />First the good parts.<br />Excellent action that's not brutal. Amazing fight scenes, but very little blood. The Clove fight, and the fireballs are amazing.<br />A great cast.. I see Peeta and Gale becoming stars. Even Prim did great. Lawrence did great too with what little they left her to work with.<br />They tried to give us a lot more of Seneca Crane than the book had, which could have been great...<br /><br />Bashing without spoiling.<br /><br />The Bad..<br />Where to start? First, if your hoping the movie shows stuff the book didn't, you'll be disappointed. Consider the movie to be highlights of the book, with a lot missing.<br />For such a huge success of a book, it should have been a three hour plus movie. In the two hours it had, I don't think anyone who hasn't read the book could understand it. They made twelve look poor, but not hungry.<br />I knew the movie couldn't compare to the book, but I thought the movie could do a few things better. Like switching the camera view to show the districts cheering, or crying. More importantly, to show us how the capitol views the star crossed angle, and how they progress. They didn't do this. We get like four shots of the crowds. Three of district twelve, and one of eleven I think. We have no idea why there is a rule change! We don't see Peeta's strategy, or much at all from Thresh. \\"I wanted to see the big Thresh showdown we didn't see in the book.\\" We don't see how loverboy is injured or why.<br />This could have been easily fixed and added like five minutes to the movie. Like in The Running Man from the 80's. They switched the camera to show the outside crouds for ten seconds at a time. You can explain a lot of the story just by showing the crowds. Watching this movie, you see no significance to Katniss giving Rue flowers. It's ashamed, but the book actually tells us more about what's happening at home than the movie does. And that was all in Katniss's head.<br /><br />They tried to build up several characters, and ended up with all of them being flat. Haymitch isn't even much of a drunk. Woody could have been perfect for that part, and they blew it. Why pay him in the first place if they won't let him act? We get about three minutes with Rue, so her scene is garbage. I got a little teary eyed, but it was because I was daydreaming of the book LOL. Cato looks a little brutal, but that's about it.<br /><br />They also took out the humor. They had one tiny laugh after Katniss meets the trainers and it wasn't even funny. I think they tried to trade Cato's anger for Seneca Crains, but they failed miserably at that too. His little visits with Snow made no sense at all and he even had to get advice from Haymitch!<br /><br />What I want to know is where they spent 75 mil at? They couldn't even rent Katniss a decent dress for her interviews. The flames were so computer fake, they looked dumb. Lawrence got 500k up front so I'm guessing the other actors got less. Woody and Sutherland had small parts, so they shouldn't have cost much.<br />This movie is ok. Probably four stars if you haven't read the book. If you can understand it. I can see myself watching the action scenes again when I'm bored and surfing chanels.<br /><br />What I would have done?<br />Made it three hours. Added camera shots to the home districs. How much emotion would that have added? Added camera shots of how the Capitol crowd reacts. How they begin to like certain people. That was pretty important. How could the director not put that stuff in? Has he not seen The Running Man? I'd have kept the humor in the movie by showing a lot more of Cato, and cutting Seneca's time way down. Showed more of the district life, and spent a lot more time building Katniss and Peeta.<br />I loved Cinna in the book, but under the time pressure for the movie, he should have been cut out. Effie too if possible. My goal would have been to give every extra minute I could to Katniss and Peeta. Katniss and her ally could have made friends in training. There was a lot of training shots where we could have seen them together more. Anything to add more character to her little ally.

B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|Here is an R-rated Action/Thriller directed by Steven Soderbergh (\\"Ocean's\\" trilogy). My biggest problem was that there was very little action and it certainly wasn't a thriller. In fact, this was the most passion-less thriller I have endured recently. There was a lot of talk, but even the talk was emotionless and ineffective; the plot was never very clear. Maybe when Amazon.com notifies me of the DVD release I can figure it out.<br /><br />The central issue seemed to be money, but there were so many double crosses and conflicting coalitions, I finally lost track. It's too bad because I found the lead to be attractive and \\"the real deal.\\" She clearly wasn't using a stunt double, as a matter of fact, in \\"real life,\\" she is a Mixed Martial Arts champion and this is only her second film.<br /><br />These folks tried to make it work:<br />  * Gina Carano (\\"Blood and Bone\\") at first glance seems to be the token female, but her character is the former black ops super soldier whose betrayal initiates all the action.<br />  * Channing Tatum (\\"The Vow\\") is a fellow professional agent who works with our heroine.<br />  * Michael Fassbender (\\"Shame,\\" who is enjoying being the flavor-of-the-year in Hollywood), plays an agent sent to Barcelona take her out. (He mostly keeps his clothes on in this one...smile...)<br />  * Ewan McGregor (\\"Beginners\\") seems to be in charge of the professional agents, but his motives aren't totally clear.<br />  * Antonio Banderas (\\"Puss in Boots\\") is the mouthpiece for the kingpin in Barcelona...we think...<br />  * Michael Angarano (\\"Red State\\") is the hapless guy in the diner whose car is commandeered and him along with it. He goes from cautious to helpful to terrified in just three scenes.<br />  * Michael Douglas (\\"Solitary Man\\") is a government official who seems to be playing both ends against the middle.<br /><br />I guess Soderbergh doesn't have to hit a home run every time at bat. The most tantalizing thing about this film was the R-rating. I don't know why. There were only a couple of gunshots, we saw no blowie uppie stuff, there were very mild car pursuits, and I noticed no profanity or nudity. Yawn....
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Despite any reservations a viewer might have about a prompt English version re-make of a very successful Swedish film still popular in this country - the first novel in author Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, namely GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO - this version of Larsson's story is immensely successful.  Much of that is due to the tightly woven screenplay by Steven Zaillian and the extraordinary direction by one of our most gifted directors, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, etc). But also the gifts of the musical composers Trent Reznor and Atticus  Ross (with a bit of help from a very well placed Morten Lauridson's `Lux Aeterna') and the bitingly vivid cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth. Add to that one of the finest collection of actors ever to collaborate on a project and the result is a film that is so engrossing that its very long length doesn't seem long enough!<br /><br />Everyone knows the story by now: disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), escapes to an island in Sweden at the request of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the 40 year absence of his niece Harriet. The Vanger family is as dysfunctional and bitterly cruel an ensemble as could be imagined and everyone on the island wants Mikael to leave.  The case fascinates Mikael and he gains access to the services of an associate, the very bizarre and brilliant pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined. There are indelible characters along the way: the disgustingly sadistic Nils Bjurman (a brilliant role for Yorick van Wageningen) who mistakenly sexually abuses Lisbeth who in turn has her own manner of revenge), the wily Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsgård), a brief but impressive Dragan Armansky (Goran Visnjic), Anita Vanger (Joely Richardson), Inspector Morelli (Donald Sumpter) etc etc etc.  Every role is cast so carefully that there is never a missed beat in this huge ensemble.<br /><br />For those who love the Swedish version of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO this English version will surely satisfy.  They are different but for this viewer the English version is far more memorable.  There is considerable frank sexual activity, torture, animal abuse, and there are some gruesome scenes: they add and must be there.  Kudos to all concerned. And yes, Rooney Mara really is that fine!

B004EPYZPS|3.0|I must be getting too old to watch Steven Speilburg. Maybe he is no longer the filmmaker he once was. I enjoyed this movie, and I was rooting for it, but in the end it was just a light snack, not a great meal. The actors were very good, even the youngest ones, the filming was very skillful, but I didn't get caught up in the story like I did once upon a time, when Speilburg and I were in our prime. There wasn't any magic. I don't mean a story about magic, I mean the magic in the story that makes you believe that it is real, makes you one with the actors, makes you forget that you have a life waiting for you when the story ends.<br /><br />I began to tire at the first big scene, when the train accident happened. It was too fantastical, wildly unrealistic. The rest of the story felt contrived. I can recommend this for an evening's entertainment. I just can't get excited about it. And that leaves me a little bit sad.
0446585025|1.0|This may well be the most disappointing book I've read.  To me, it was a wisp of a book,<br />and while I expected it to be light and comedic, it did not begin to measure up to the quality<br />of the vignettes Ellen shares on her TV show. I must confess, I stopped reading it half way<br />through.
B005M61PGA|5.0|This album has that early western swing sound that was simple and pure to the land.  The songs roll from one to the other and each one wants you to push the back button and play it again.  This is one of those albulms that you will put on Sunday morning and be listening to the next morning on the way to work.  It is just simple and pure and totally beautiful even played loud.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This is a fun and humorous little game.  There isn't a lot of strategy involved but it's fun to play with and some of the element combinations are clever and unexpected. I have had no issues with force quits on Kindle so I'm not sure why people are still voting up the one-star reviews.
1612130283|1.0|Like bad porn, you can look at it for five minutes, then it gets old. That's how this book reads.  Repetitive sex scenes and unoriginal language, this reminds me of the Penthouse Forum letters.  If you want anything that enriches your mind or spirit, don't read this book.  It's a complete waste of time.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great card game, easy to play. Would recommend to anyone who likes solitaire. You can build up to playing more than one suit.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is my favorite Beatles album...40+ years later. While The Beatles were together, their latest release was my favorite...with the only exception being Yellow Submarine.
B0087ZG7J8|4.0|I read the book which the vast majority of the reviewers did not. The first movie incorporated some of the storyline and added new material. This third movie included some of the beginning of the book that was left out of the first movie. Again new material was added which changed the storyline.<br /><br />If I ignored the book and just rated the movie for its storyline, it was very entertaining. However I can only give it 4 stars because several scenes were just overdramatized. Had the first movie stuck closer to the book, it would have been even better. But what I missed in the first movie was for the most part included in this one so that is why it was satisfying to me. Many of the negative reviewers did not know about this splitting up of the book's story and so did not understand the significance of what they were viewing.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|this game is an awesome version of Angry Birds! I love it so much! my only complaint is that there are only 2 levels. so I definatly hope there will be an update.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I could not put these books down. Loved them. So what does that mean? I loved the first 3 books of the Song of Ice and Fire series by George RR Martin and these books are that good. The Hunger Games has characters both despicable, ambiguous and heroic like these books. Good stuff, enjoy!
0439023513|5.0|I'm personally a little confused by the negativity of some of these reviews. Mockingjay is a book that is fantastic. IT is NOT a feel-good book. If you have idolized the characters, if you want happily ever after, if you think that after hell everyone can go back to normal and the only residual damage will be a few monuments to fallen soldiers. If you believe that fighting does not leave permanent scars and that your heroes will fine, I don't recommend this series. MockingJay is realistic in its story line. The rebellion may succeed, but those who fought for it will pay the price forever, and despite the capitol's sins, the rebellion is not much better when it comes to matters of guilt.<br />  I loved the plot twists and I love that Collins wrote as needed to be done. She surprised me in being willing to kill Prim. Most authors I think wouldn't have been so willing to kill a likable character. Yet I felt she failed to provide motivation for such an act. Neither Coin nor Snow have any reason to kill Prim. They would be better off holding her hostage for Katniss's behavior. The other thing is at this stage in the story, District 13 thinks Katniss is dead. Why would Coin take out Prim who is already a skilled medic and likely to be a valuable resource to 13?  I absolutely loved the concept but it needed some more fleshing out.<br /> The book is told entirely from Katniss's perspective. Entirely from the perspective of one psychologically traumatized teen, whose being used as mouth piece for a rebellion that she has fueled without ever realizing she joined in the first place. People complain that she's too gutted emotionally, too devastated to be interesting. It's a good point and exactly why I like the series. Katniss is not a super hero, not a tremendous leader or even a skilled strategist. The fact that Collins writes from this perspective instead of giving her all these abilities that she does not possess is what makes the book seem real. I appreciate that she dealtwith the psychological issues and wasn't afraid to delve into what it actually feels like and how much you actually get of what's happening when you're mentally lost in these issues. It's a hauntingly accurate depiction of the real thing.<br /> It could however have been better. The other characters needed to be developed more fully and given more complexity, more reason and motivation to act as they did. Even though, it's from Katniss's perspective, the growth of other characters should have been evident in their reactions to and interaction with her and I felt like they just fell flat. I love the story, don't get me wrong but I also feel like saying, Collins, do another re-write. It's an EXCELLENT story, just polish it a little more.

B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles were my main musical influence throughout my teenage years. Sgt.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|I was a fan of Chloe Moretz after seeing her brilliant work in Kick Ass, but that didn't have me completely sold on Let Me In. Movies like this tend to falter if the script is terrible, even if there's a good cast. Fortunately, Let Me In has a good script and the whole movie is a real treat from start to finish.<br /><br />The film is really powered by Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee. The two young actors are given a big task of essentially carrying the film. The maturity level of the two of them is incredible and they handle some pretty dark stuff in this movie.<br /><br />There haven't been many horror movies as riveting as Let Me In recently. It might be a remake of the Swedish film, but it has plenty of character in its own right. After seeing the original, I was amazed at how Let Me In paid homage to the book and the film while maintaining a level of originality in its own right. I suppose that's probably because Moretz and Smit-McPhee are vastly different from the actors in the original film. Personally, I liked them better.<br /><br />If you like horror movies, you have to watch Let Me In. Too many horror movies are made these days that lack character and are just plain silly. Let Me In pays respect to the genre, but allows itself the chance to make its mark.

B007JRU4N0|1.0|My wife and I sat down to watch what we thought might be a good movie, drama with a few comedic moments...WRONG!  We were very unimpressed with this mess of a movie centered around the husband and raising his daughters along with his wife being in a coma.  The only plus was the soundtrack and scenery of Hawaii.  We would not recommend this depressing movie to anyone, not even the most die hard Clooney fan (if there is such a thing).<br />Again the Amazon.com streaming rental option is our way to go at home!!!  We love being able to download movies right on our TV.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|I know that is a weird combination, but the gore was over the top, Jews were depicted as depraved mobsters, and what plot that existed moved at a painfully slow pace.  I was disappointed -- I'd heard this was a good \\"sleeper\\" movie.  Suggest you skip this one!
B004E0Z4XK|3.0|After listening to this highly enjoyable album many times, I keep leaving it wanting more, and so find it wanting.<br /><br />As great as Jack White and Nora Jones are here (and they truly are captivating in their songs), I just keep leaving this album feeling never quite satisfied. I truly enjoy it every time, it is transcendental, it takes me away, but it is not sustaining, not quite substantial enough to fully satisfy.<br /><br />It's as if one is enjoying an amazing cup of tea that just has not steeped long enough. You taste the bouquet, enjoy wonderful fragrances, but the palate is never saturated. Or like being the help at an amazing banquet, you witness fantstic courses, smell the food, are immersed in it, and maybe sneak a nibble hear and there, but never sit down to the full feast.<br /><br />So it is with Rome, and I find, better to have witnessed the banquet than to have never been there at all.

I'm also a high school physics teacher and I use these games to demonstrate various physics principles, such as projectile motion and gravity, in my classes.  While there are definitely certain violations of physics in this game, there is a lot of great realistic physics, all which can lead to great discussions with my students.  And, of course, the kids love it because its so much fun!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I heard about this series from my friend and I am glad she told me about them.  The books are really well written, the character descriptions were fantastic and the story telling was magical.  I instantly felt I was in the story following along every single footstep of the way.<br />The story is like a movie and if you like action and adventure, it grips you the entire way.<br />The only thing I didn't like was I felt like time was lost between each book and I wanted to know the ins and outs of what I missed.<br />I would say if you're a Twilight fan you'll absolutely love this series.  But if you didn't like Twilight, I think you'll be even more obsessed.  Maybe I'm wrong but that's how I felt about it!  Enjoy nevertheless, and I know millions already have!

B003Y5H5HO|1.0|The packaging for this item was very poorly made.  The case was cardboard.  The disc appears to have had the title written on it with a permanent marker.  There were no previews for other movies on this disc, just the movie that was ordered.  The movie description on the back of the case is just a piece of paper glued on the back of the case.  It has strong resemblances of a bootleg disc.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Although I am not good at writing reviews(never tried), this one deserves it. Won't get into the details about it or mention anything directly from the books so that you can enjoy it entirely like I did. The book was simply amazing. You fall in love with the characters, and their build up is amazing. Side and back stories to their relationships with each other are nicely pieced. I couldn't stop reading it until I reached the end. Basically it has a bit of everything. Won't be disappointed by it. The pace that everything took place in was not bad at all. If anything I feel I wanted more of the book which would mean more suffering for the characters that I enjoyed so much so that wouldn't be right. Happy Hunger Games and, May the Odds be Ever in your Favor. Pick it up you simply won't regret it. No matter what age.

B000AYEL6U|3.0|A triple D series.  I found North and South to be dark, dreary, and depressing.  Colors, scenes, were all in dark colors.  The acting was great, characters mostly developed, moral plot was contradictory.  I won't be keeping this to view again.  The best part was the ending.  It did end on an upbeat note, but did not make up for the hours of dark, dreary, and depressing.<br /><br />The Socialist movement for fairness has taken the poor worker from grinding poverty to a place with perks and pensions that could not have been imagined 100 years ago.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Game of Thrones has a long ways to go still, and only time will tell if this series will live up to GRR Martin's excellent fantasy novels, but if this first season is any indication, the series is in good hands. (also, I think Game of Thrones might be unique in being based on book series that is still yet to be finished; Martin has at least two more books to add to the current five that are out as of 2012...)<br /><br />The series is also one of the few times, in my opinion, that a film adaptation has been so true to the source material, fantasy novels or otherwise. For people unfamiliar with the books, make no mistake: they are filled with violence, sex, war, political machinations, and many other such examples of the darker side of human nature that many will find uncomfortable to read, or in this case, watch.<br /><br />But the way in which Game of Thrones weaves these often horrifying elements into a fantasy setting is what makes the series so appealing. The attraction that the HBO series and the books have for many (like myself) is that they portray a version a fantasy world that is much more believable than is typical for the genre, which often lacks realistic portrayals of human behavior, instead relying on characters that are clearly either 'good' or 'evil' (eg, Lord of the Rings)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used this app both on my Andriod phone and now on my Kindle Fire. It is accurate and easy to use. My son loves checking it as well and since it gives specific weather details, we have started having great conversations about how different elements affect weather. Great app!

0553801473|2.0|There's not much to be said that hasn't already been said.  There aren't too many characters, but there are sure as hell too many POV's.  If the actions of minor characters are significant to some part of the main or a sub plot, then the reader could easily be made aware of it some other way than devoting multiple boring chapters to spelling it out for us.  I digress; I just felt like venting.  The other high rated reviews do a nice job of explaining how this book, and the series in general, are taking a turn for the worst.<br /><br />P.S.  For those curious about the title of my review; after I finished reading the book I couldn't help but draw a comparison between this book and Jordan's 10th book.  From start to finish, in both books, every character is either in the exact same spot/predicament they started in or were in the same predicament but on the verge of something interesting happening.  That, to me, is a horrible way to compose a book and is inexcusable to me given the size of these books.  Surely there is more than enough room to fit in some epic, attention grabbing event that moves this glacial plot along and gets the reader excited about the series again.  Oh well.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|This movie is really different. I would recommend it to those who have seen so many movies that the plots are predictable, boring and the characters contrite. Not so in this movie- the heroine is different, the plot twisted, the ending a surprise. It's a commentary on life and one's outlook on life, yet thoroughly engrossing. Well edited, directed, developed, I have watched it more than once and will watch it again and again.

B004G6009K|5.0|Wonderful movie!!! This Rapunzel story line is so fresh & new. Yay, Disney!!<br />I actually bought this particular item for the 3D Blu-Ray. I had been a little nervous since I was told that Disney was doing a shoddy job revamping their older movies into 3D. Granted, this isn't an older movie and was made for 3D, but I was still a little hesitant. To make a long story short, 3D qualities of this movie don't let down. If you have a 3D TV/Blu-Ray player and like Disney, this is certainly a must-have in your collection.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was really dissapointed with this book to say the least. The first twwo were so great and this just seemed rushed.

Also gale is like her best friend he doesn't eceb visit here after all they have been thrum really...this book Mindanao sucked. And worst off all is the ending. She has kids with peeta.

B003Y5H4Y8|1.0|What a stunning waste of time.  I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but John Madden is a respectable director, and the trifecta of Helen Mirren/Tom Wilkinson/Ciaran Hinds promised, at least, some fine acting.  But the movie is a long, pointless,<br />totally non-thrilling \\"thriller\\".  The wntire story could have been told in about 30 minutes, but was drawn out to nearly 2 deadly dull hours.  And, as it turns out, the aforementioned actors are barely IN the film.  Most of the story concerns these<br />characters 30 yrs ago, so they are all played by younger actors (naturally), all of whom were either completely uninteresting and/or shrilly overacting (sorry, Ms Chastain).<br />  AVOID THIS!!!!!!
B001AITGWE|5.0|This guy is angry and he's putting his foot down.  Bill (Michael Douglas) isn't happy, so he's angry, but at the same time he's also the hero of our story.  The story begins at a point where Bill is stuck in traffic, he's divorced, his wife has a restraining order that doesn't allow him to be near his wife or his daughter even on his daughter's birthday and plus he's just lost his job.  That makes him economically viable.  Within the first 3 minutes of this film, we can catch the moment where Bill's faith in the world extinguishes and his life ceases to mean anything for himself.  It is from then on that Bill just does not care anymore.  And due to his increased irritability, Bill is now more violent because he's not getting his point across otherwise since the people that end up upsetting him are unwise to the fact that he has completely lost it.  At some point in the movie, there's a skinhead that compares his racial discrimination to Bill's anger, but that just makes Bill more angry because Bill is not racist.  Bill just can't take it anymore.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I bought the paid version specifically in order to avoid ads. Since installing the latest upgrade, not only was ALL MY DATA ERASED, but I am now forced to &quot;earn rewards&quot; which are nothing but ADS!

Bad form, Halfbrick Studios... very bad form. :(

1416511946|5.0|I'm not going to lie, I did not know who Nikki Sixx was until I pick up \\"This Is Gonna Hurt\\" last year but let's be honest; I did not give it any attention or thought. I think the only reason I picked it up was because the cover caught my eye. And the same goes with \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" but for this one, I gave it more attention and thought. I did research on Nikki Sixx just to give me an idea of who he was/is, where he came from, watched vidoes, etc. and I was intrigued. After reading articles and watching videos, I wanted to buy the book to get a much better insight on this person life.<br /><br />I was debating if I wanted to buy the Kindle version or pay the extra $5 and buy the printed version. In the end, I bought the printed version exactly a week ago today and I must say, it's AMAZING!! As soon as I finished, I wanted to get \\"This Is Gonna Hurt\\". My stubburn self did not want to wait two weeks 'til I went shopping in the States (I live in Canada, the taxes here are ridiculous, even though books only have 5% tax, but still!) so I bought it yesterday.<br /><br />I was always fascinated by the drug world and I have much respect for Nikki Sixx and what he's been through. For those whom are willing and wants to read this incredible book, I HIGHLY!!! recommened it to you. You will not be bored. And once you finish reading, you'll be thinking like the rest of us, why is this guy still alive!?
0393327345|5.0|This book is by far my absolute favorite, and has been for years.

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I finished this book a few days ago and I had to give myself some time to really digest it.  First off, it is incredibly well written.  For those complaining about the density and florid nature of the prose I would ask you to remember one of the first rules of writing: show don't tell.  Ms. Shriver has shown us the character of Eva through the rambling, condescending, know it all nature of Eva's own `letters' and it was very well done.  Was it annoying?  Yes.  But I've met Eva-like people at parties, social events etc., and I have no doubt if they sat down to write a letter, it would bear a striking resemblance to Eva's.<br /><br />And now, let's be honest, there are no good people in this story.  Every major character - to some degree - is a villain.  Kevin is the actual killer, but was he a natural born killer or was he formed into one? Due to the one sided nature of the story we'll never know.<br /><br />Franklin is a self-made caricature of a loving dad, and lets his troubled son get away with everything.  He is more like an ostrich than a parent and ignores his wife's genuine concerns by blaming her for being too suspicious.  Willful ignorance does not give someone a pass or make them a good parent.  Do we feel sorry for him? Yes.  Was he part of the problem with Kevin? Absolutely.  If he provided a united front with his wife their son might have been sent to a counselor to get help with his issues.<br /><br />Eva is not likeable, she is not a good mother (to Kevin at least), and she isn't really even a nice person but of all the characters in the book she is the one who knows something is deeply wrong with her boy.  Mainly because, as I think it becomes clearer toward the end of the book, she is so much LIKE Kevin.  When she describes seeing herself in Kevin's dark eyes and Armenian features I don't think she just means the physical version of herself, but all her psychotic messed up personality disorders rolled up in there as well.<br /><br />There are no real answers in We Need to Talk About Kevin, which can be frustrating to some readers, but it is a nuanced and gripping look back at the birth of a mass murderer.  Even toward the end when Kevin has grown older in prison and is starting to show a tiny glimmer of remorse for what he has done, there is some kernel of doubt...is this new Kevin just an act to garner Eva's affections?  Or has Eva's unwavering visits (and a tough time in jail) done what half-assed parenting could not and actually turned Kevin into a real human being?<br /><br />Again there are no answers, but that is what a really great story does sometimes, it leaves things just ambiguous enough that you continually think about the characters and have to wonder what was really going on.  Could Kevin's actions ever have been stopped? I still can't come to a conclusion.l answers in We Need to Talk About Kevin, which can be frustrating to some readers, but it is a nuanced and gripping look back at the birth of a mass murderer.

B0026S1XDM|5.0|I've been a casual fan of Tubular Bells for a long time, but it was kind of a guilty pleasure; originally picked up [[ASIN:B00005AY1C Best of Tubular Bells]] because I was a fan of [[ASIN:B001992NW4 The Exorcist]]. Back then I thought it felt kind of goofy, odd and hippie-ish, and that sentiment lives on to some degree; when you check out the television version of Part One on the DVD included here, it feels like an extended jam session. Groovy, man. However, with this extensive remastering, you truly get a feel of respect for the piece; how varied and extensive it is, segueing between glockenspiel, organ, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass, piano, and many more instruments without collapsing or losing a sense of place. The sheer number of instruments (and live - musicians,) working in tandem is respectable. And this mix, particularly the surround version (which I had the pleasure of listening through tonight) really brings out the piece in earnest. The surround is not \\"flashy\\", there is hardly any \\"moving\\" around channels whatsoever (save a bit of the orchestra in the rears, which is appropriately awe-inspiring). Part One opens with that piano and eerie glockenspiel, and it sits right around you in a straight but effective way. When the bass kicks in, the acoustics take center stage and bass jumps at you from behind (or vice versa). The mix breathes new air into the proceedings and gives small details their place to shine - near the end you can even hear the mistakes on the double speed guitar. It explodes and is reborn, and the acoustic guitars are surprisingly low-key; the piano, glockenspiel and those amazing choirs really take center stage, but the real kicker is the electric guitar and sharpness in the bass; not a low menacing rumble as before, but more in your face - massive without losing place in the aural orb so to speak. If Part One is more rock meditation (a grand symphony of the counterculture?), Part Two feels a lot more cohesive, like a single narrative passing through the eons. It stars out somberly (and the surrounds don't pull much weight at first, give it a moment), sounding like sunday morning in the church of rock and roll with all those organs and flutes. Then it slowly gives way to something more aggressive and feral; the Caveman section, once so silly (the growled vocals overpowering the whole thing) is now a really enormous roar of rock which rips its way into your living room and finally crescendos with guitars shredding, wolves howling and cavemen growling. That's followed by a landing as the acoustics take you back to earth, to lastly give you the real acoustic kicker; the Sailor's Hornpipe is both sharp, funny and beautiful all at the same time. It gains momentum and the guitar strings send you off on your way. But that's not all; you also get Mike Oldfield's Single, the theme that's only hinted at in Part Two, here in full majestic glory. I think this four minute-track is worth the price of admission alone, in surround sound it's certainly one of the most beautiful musical experiences I have ever had. Majestic. If you have any friends doubting the effectiveness of music in surround, sit them down in the middle of your speakers, crank it up (without going overboard mind you) and play this piece from start to finish. I am so glad I invested in this edition, because even if you can't find the time to \\"just\\" sit in your couch and listen to a whole hour-medley of sublime, you've got the two CDs with both the remastered and the original mix; I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by just how different they sound, totalling three very different but equally worthy versions of one album in the same package. Now if Mike would just do a *complete* DTS version of [[ASIN:B000096H33 Tubular Bells 2003]], he could have even more of my moolah, and I could have more glorious meditation time in a world of notes and haze.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Highly unlikely, but if the author makes it to this review a couple of quick fixes:<br /><br />1. Juliette tells the character Lukas that she is thirty-four years old in Wool 5. A few chapters later, Lukas \\"knew\\" her to be thirty-six. Small detail. Simple fix.<br /><br />2. \\"Knox picked one up--could FELT the heat in a barrel recently bored and rifled...\\" Figure something needs to give here.<br /><br />I felt this to be a four and a half star book--rounding up because it was closer to five than four in quality. Several chapters in the last third(ish) of Wool 5 could have been bundled together, imo, and made the read a little smoother. A small quibble, and one that is not meant to detract from an enjoyable read.

B004L79VUI|2.0|Serious Band fans always approach Robbie's solo projects with fear and trepidation. After writing masterpieces for The Band, his solo work has ranged from mediocre to worse. How can this be? Where did the Muse go? Well, this one fooled me. A decent song to open with, then the album gets stronger, building to the wistful, surprisingly revealing and moving song about his exit from the legendary group (This Is Where I Get Off), one that even sounds like The Band. Robbie's never stellar vocals even sound OK here. Wow! Then...<br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />Seven tracks round out the album, ranging from the inconsequential to the tedious. Several feature the bland and soulless lounge jazz contributions of the once great Eric Clapton. (Aside: I saw Doyle Bramhall II open for Clapton a few years ago with a smokin' blues-rock set, followed by intermission, after which the former Guitar God came on playing the lamest lounge jazz you ever heard, right on the heels of Bramhall burning down the barn. Go figure. Fortunately the two encores were better than the main set. But I digress.) No, contributions from Clapton and Winwood do not save the rest of this album. Two insipid instrumentals that sound like New Age Yuppie dinner music; a couple of tracks with overproduced but underpowered attempts at soul or funk workouts; the inexplicably lame \\"Axman,\\" which oddly makes no attempt to dazzle us with guitar heroics as the title would imply, but just meanders on pointlessly. (And, of course, in his prime Robbie was a great guitarist... what gives?)<br /><br />Go listen to Levon Helm's \\"Electric Dirt\\" and forget about this one. Even the five decent opening tracks lose much of their appeal after the disappointment of what follows.

B0078N2MTE|4.0|Strong film, but not quick to say the least.  Feels like reading a good book.  It is a horror movie if the things that scare you include things like getting cancer or developing Alzheimer's disease.  The finish is the only controversial element and worth the effort.  Avoid spoilers and reviews if possible.  Find 2 hours that you might spend reading and settle in for a psychological challenge.  By most accounts this is not an uplifting film.

B007FDE4Y8|5.0|As others have written this is very well built for the same price (currently) as the Flycam DSLR Nano which is quite clumsy in comparison. However, the Flycam does allow sitting the whole thing on the ground, which is awesome when you want to put down your rig (and generally you most certainly will after 5-10 minutes!). This one you will have to pop out the baseplate I suppose.<br /><br />It is absolutely designed for a rig weighing 2-5lbs from what I can tell...a Canon Rebel with its kit lens is too light for this design. Whereas a 5D3 with its kit lens of 24-105L works perfectly on it, even though that kills your arm to lug around for a while. The unit even with all its weights is very light, but since it works via leverage the lighter little cameras you might prefer to carry might not work on this. The flycam nano seemed to work better with those, its weights pull straight down.<br /><br />Plusses include a spirit level, a hollow handle so you could, in theory, use some form of mounting rod into the handle. And the fine adjustments are very nice, though they do offer four locking screws each, which means you have somewhat of a dilemma between adjusting and locking.<br /><br />Minuses are that there is no where to store the 1/4\\"-20 adapter that holds your camera onto this...though it may be best to find a lightweight QR plate to permanently moor here. It's also easy to hit the weights part with your body (thigh, belly, elbow) as you move, you have to hold the handle quite a distance from yourself, which means it's taking leverage on your arm. And the thumb plate pan control is utterly brilliant, all of these should have them...on others you sort of pan by sheer force of will.<br /><br />For the price of a Merlin you can get both this and the flycam and a nice wide angle lens to play with too.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|I've always liked knowing where my food came from.  Even if it does give that creature a face, I think it makes me appreciate everything more. That being said, life happens and I find myself shopping at the regular supermarket more and more due to finances and time constraints.  And I've gotten away from purchasing my food from local sources.  Watching this movie reminded me of just why I adopted those better practices in the first place, and its time to start getting back to doing so.<br /><br />There are several parts to this movie involving the food industry, but they all have a prevalent message.  And indeed, the first couple words of the documentary kind of sum it all up with expressing how people have changed what they eat more in the past 50 years than they did in the 10,000 years before then.  And really everything is focused on Corporate farming and how much it has changed the family farm.  They explore the way animals are butchered, to how they are kept, to even how seeds are grown and the controversy behind seed saving.  As a warning, when the animals are butchered it is directly shown, as is a lot of other hard images regarding animals and how they are processed.  If you have a weak stomach, or sensitive disposition, I'm not sure you could handle this film.<br /><br />There are several interviewees in the film, from farmers that grow their products organically, to those who take place in factory farming, to a woman who lost her child after he ate contaminated meat.  Her story is actually the one that really sticks with you in this movie.  Because nothing really happened after her son died to prevent future things from happening.  But she keeps fighting for government officials to pass \\"Kevin's Law\\".  A law that will give the USDA the power to shut down factories if they fail safety and health standards too many times.  It should be noted that all the major food corporations were offered to be interviewed and offered rebuttals in this film, and all declined to be interviewed or even to talk to the filmmakers.<br /><br />But the interviews with everyone else are just as informative.  I especially liked the farmer that did things low scale and slaughtered his animals outside, himself, and knew exactly how he was raising his food.  And his cows got to eat grass, so I imagine they were pretty happy cows.  With all the talk about \\"pink slime\\" lately too its made me want to buy a freezer and just go out and purchase a side of beef and process it myself.  Which really I should, it would make me appreciate the work behind that burger I grill.  The movie actually did get into a little about hamburger meat is made and processed putting a visual to the information out there available in print.<br /><br />There is some political discussion in this documentary.  But nothing specifically pulling out a certain party and putting it under the microscope.  It more goes for certain individuals and where they worked before getting government jobs.  It also explores what effect big corporations and lobbyists have on food laws too.  So if politics is a topic that gets you riled up, I'm not sure if this would be a good fit for a movie for you.  But honestly, I do think people should get riled up about their food.  Its what we survive on and we should be putting the best into our bodies, and we should be making those decisions intelligently.<br /><br />On a separate note the cinematography in this movie is very good.  I liked the effects they had and the way they shot the interviews and showed the footage they had gathered.  It was very professionaly done.  The music on the other hand was less than stellar.  It reminded me of a funeral parlor and while it fit the dreary tone of the whole documentary, I would have preferred there be no music at all.  It just took away from their message because it was too dramatic.<br /><br />Very informative. although it may turn you to vegetarianism for a few days after eating it.  But its information that should be out there and available for people to make their own decisions regarding what happens with their food.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012t should be out there and available for people to make their own decisions regarding what happens with their food.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

0345505387|3.0|If you read Outlander and then read The Exile, you'll realize something is lost between the novel and the graphic novel, but that is owing to a couple of factors.<br /><br />1) Change in mediums.  You can't expect to fit 800 pages of flowing description and sweeping romance into a graphic novel unless you want it to be gigantic.  The Exile covers the span of the first THIRD of Outlander.  This is important that people know it's not going to cover everything that happens in Outlander.<br />2) Change in perspective.  Gabaldon writes from Claire's POV, and this is told more through Murtagh's POV (perhaps 'semi-omnipotent' might be better suited here).  What makes the romance of the novel come alive is because it's told through the eyes of one of the participants, and the fact this story isn't told solely through Jamie's or Claire's eyes takes away some of that connection.<br />3)  It's not meant to be a retelling of Outlander.  It is its own story, but it does follow the same timeline (essentially) as Outlander.<br /><br />If you sit down to read this graphic novel expecting it to be a lean, mean retelling of Outlander, you'll be sorely upset.  If you read it keeping in mind it's in its own medium (which has to follow its own guidelines), it's a decent read.  The romance between Claire and Jamie, part of what makes Outlander so compelling, was very diluted in the graphic novel (it had to be, since it doesn't allow for much inner monologue).  I could have also done without the Kenneth storyline.  It felt thrown in and unrealistic given the parameters of the novel.  I didn't really understand his purpose in the story until I'd already seen him a few times, at which point I had already decided he could've been taken away from the story without it losing anything.<br /><br />The illustrations are gorgeous, though.  Sometimes it felt like Claire's boobs got bigger with each page, and sometimes she looked like a different person altogether, but all the other characters looked very well-done.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent story.  If you're looking to blow a couple of hours, go for it.  It took me an hour and a half to read it from cover to cover, not because I'm a fast reader but because the pages go by really quickly.<br /><br />NOTE:  I'm not sure whether I got a misprint or what, but the first 30-50 pages were VERY out of order.  I'd start in one scene and the next page is three days later, then twenty pages down the road it's back to that scene that was cut-off halfway through.  I was able to figure it out, but it was distracting until it got lined out.  This is why page numbers are IMPORTANT.  Just thought I'd warn anyone in case they have this issue, too.d very well-done.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent story.  If you're looking to blow a couple of hours, go for it.

0307719219|4.0|The basic premises of this book are on target: Competitive markets create economic progress and widespread prosperity. Monopolistic practices encourage the reverse. Democratic political institutions tend to favor competitive markets. Therefore, democratic political institutions create better economies than totalitarian or oligopolistic governments.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book goes on and on about it. The thoughts are not new or novel.<br /><br />On re-reading, I find more to like here. Much of the world does not share the authors' views as I do. Therefore maybe what I find too lengthy is merely necessary to explain why it is correct.

B007G5K066|1.0|a little too cryptic for my taste and somehow the only possible role gary oldman could be miscast for. there is no satisfaction and no real audience participation in the mystery so it just feels dusty and lame.
B000ZN802W|2.0|I bought \\"Into the Wild\\" because K-Stew was in it. She had a minor role. I read a review that she ran around in her underwear for the entire movie. Not true. She was in one short scene in her underwear with, of course, skin colored undies her underwear. She was about 16 when she did that movie.<br />The story was entertaining as movies go. BUT, it was not believable. The story was jacked up with such things as his killing a Moose with a .22 caliber rifle. No way. I've been in the back country of Alaska and no sane person would try to kill a Moose with a .22, unless he wanted to be killed by an angry Moose. Also the star Emile Hirsch, fell into a raging Alaskan river just as after spring broke. He walked back to an old bus with broken out windows for shelter. Again, in the spring in Alaska if you fall into a raging, icy river and manage to get out, you die later that night. Night temperatures in Alaska will go below Zero in the spring. As for his journey, he went from Virginia to Colorado, to Arizona then California before going to Alaska.<br />He did all of this traveling and at some point burned his money. He kept a diary, that is how we know all about his exploits. Well, it was a real man who made the trip and died in an old bus in Alaska.<br />The only part I really believe is his dying in a bus in Alaska. The rest of it is not believable, been there and done some of that. But it was oh-so-heart warming. It wasn't until after I saw the movie that I read on the DVD cover that it was written and directed by Sean Penn. I do not care for any of his work, acting or writing or directing. Buy it for your collection. For the price, it is a buy.
B005NQ5LQ4|2.0|This kid's talents and efforts don't hold a candle to Donnie Yen. When Yen, Jet Li, Bruce Lee made a film, one could appreciate the natural fluid movements of the martial arts choreography. This film looks hopped up on Camera speed ( similar to how Jason Statham ruined Transporter 3 ). It took way too much away from the action sequence as it is appreciated and intended to be. The story line was fine....Ip Man's young character was fairly well done. But as said earlier....Yen had to be shaking his head in disappointment that the filmography was not properly continued.
B004X4QW42|5.0|It's like Rocky and Karate Kid all in one. Only Ip Man 2 is better. It kept me on the edge of my seat more than once. Very entertaining.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|MUCH better than the Hollywood version on all aspects. First, the lead actress is fantastic. I saw another series/film of hers,[[ASIN:B000M2E32M Daniel Deronda]], and was captivated. She has one of those faces that just draws you in, vivid expressions and plays her roles so well for someone who never even intended to be an actress. Johnny Lee Miller is great as Mr. Knightly, he really brought out the character on all aspects, his feelings for Emma, his brotherly role, not too overbearing, he had this masculine quality with just a hint of vulnerability, humility, just loved him. I loved all of the side characters, they did just a fabulous job with casting and i kept comparing this to the other versions and just felt the others were definitely lacking. This adaptation, for me, is the most enjoyable, definitely a keeper to watch time and time again, and a funny one at that! BBC always does it better when it comes to Austen films and the like.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app is made useless by the excess of ads to spam and questionable material. If you try to uninstall, it appears sticky, reappearing, not fully uninstalling. One of the worst apps that I mistakenly installed.
B0051BLT4O|4.0|The book was very helpful for someone with limited understanding of photography and lighting. Helene's friendly tone and generous nature came through on every page. I felt like a good friend was patiently walking me through each step. I'm finally able to pull it all together and systematically work toward great results instead of winging it with fingers crossed. I am using the lessons in this book to photograph handmade items and these techniques are appropriate to close up product shots of many sorts.<br /><br />Since I'm pleased overall, why not five stars? Two reasons:<br /><br />First there are so many production flaws with the Kindle edition that I almost sent it back. Numerous photos are missing or are wildly out of order in the text. There are typos and info that does not quite seem right--is a shutter speed of I/80 of really displayed as 800?--so I am not completely confident in the instructions. For other buyers who are considering the Kindle edition beware! The photos on screen are small jpegs that do not display the visual information well. When side by side comparisons are made it's almost impossible to see what the author is talking about. Perhaps at some point it will be possible to have high resolution, zoomable photos in Kindle. The print edition might be a better choice at this point.<br /><br />Second, Helene, like many photographers, is post-processing averse. She dismisses post processing out of hand saying no one wants to spend time in front of a computer to get things right. Frankly, for some of us it's a trade off between hours spent fiddling with the setup or potentially less time in the studio in front of a computer. My camera can't achieve the shallow depth of field so popular today but a quick blur and mask in Photoshop gets me the look I'm after. I recognize how professionally appropriate it is to get the desired result with the camera vs. in Photoshop, but there's a lot that can be done in post that can be useful too. A more balanced approach to using post processing to achieve a delightful finished product would have been great.<br /><br />I kept the book because it was written from the heart by a skilled pro who shared a lot of great information in a few pages. For me, this book much is more useful than the technical lighting manuals I already own that leave me feeling lost in a sea of too much information. In this review I felt the flaws needed to be noted, but I think the book has solid value despite them. If you're trying to get your legs under you as a photographer doing close up work, this book is a great find.

0307959856|3.0|Despite some felicitous language and developments, overall I expected more from P.D. James' foray into fanfiction. I think the non-mysterious mystery did unfold and resolve very much in the manner it would have had an Austen-era author written the book, and I liked that. So the main pleasure should have been the characters, and that's where the disappointment lay, mainly from the almost complete absence of interaction between Elizabeth and Darcy. If you're not going to give us the two of them together, why write in the P&P world? The 3rd-person info-dump chapters were a slog. What a contract to P&P itself--look how the opening chapter is nearly all dialogue. Like many other readers, I found the transformation of Colonel Fitzwilliam to be both unpleasant and unconvincing. I liked the look into the daily life of Pemberley, the depiction of the era's legal proceedings, the appealing OC romance for Georgiana. There were lines I thought Austen herself could have written. Overall, though, the book lacked any real spark. I haven't ready any of the other published sequels, but 've read much better stuff on \\"The Republic of Pemberley\\" fanfiction site.

B007C3TVNA|5.0|\\"He's just a boy, he's a sweet little boy. That's what boys do.\\" Eva (Swinton) is a new mother who is concerned with her new son. He seems off to her and becomes increasingly vicious in his actions and words. When Kevin does the unthinkable she is left to live her life in shame and solidarity with constant reminders by the people of the town she lives in. This is one of the most difficult experiences I have ever had watching a movie. Much like \\"American History X\\" this movie makes you feel contradicting feelings throughout and the end leaves you wondering why. Not since the \\"Passion Of The Christ\\" has a movie had such an effect on me that I hard a hard time talking when it was over. I really cannot explain this movie in words that will do it justice to the way that I felt about it but this is a movie that made me feel sick to my stomach, angry as hell and utterly helpless all at once. One of the most important movies of the year, but one that I don't think I could ever watch again. If you can handle it you should do whatever you can to see this. A movie you want to tell everyone to watch but at the same time are afraid to. Disturbingly haunting and emotionally draining as well as being the most powerful movie I have seen mabye ever. Overall, a reminder of the power that a movie can have. I was left stunned for hours by this movie.  I give it an A+.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Count me as a big fan of this series even though I regard Jane Austin's own writing as a boring or worse. One of my worst remembrances of college English, in fact, was being forced to write an essay, through gritted teeth, on Pride and Prejudice.  However, I have to say that Austen's stories make very good movies or, as in this instance, tv series.  The producers have managed to remain true to the spirit of Austen's story while adding the novel twist of a modern London girl being transported back to Austen's era. Wisely the story does not dwell on the time travel aspect,and does not become a science fiction tale.  There is just a simple door in a bathroom wall through which the modern heroine goes back in time while Elizabeth Bennett enters contemporary England. It then closes, locks and plays very little role thereafter.  Virtually all of the story takes place in the earlier era with only a small segment where the heroine and some of the Austen characters end up in contemporary London. Probably the most surprising aspect of this story is that it is exceedingly funny and I for one don't laugh easily. Very few things make me laugh out loud but this story often had me laughing to the point of tears. Because this is based on tv series I had expected to watch this over a number of days, Instead my family and I sat and watched it from start to finish, all three hours in one sitting.  A first rate production, excellent picture and sound, highly recommended!

B007N5YIUS|4.0|Even after playing ANGRY BIRDS a few times, I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about. The game can be highly addictive, but I got bored after playing a few times. Just after the release, I had the opportunity to play ANGRY BIRDS SPACE. Personally, I found this a better game than the original. The graphics have improved slightly (though that's not really a factor in the Angry Birds universe) and the game is more challenging. The setting of space adds to the fun rather than taking something away or making it too convoluted. It's just a better game than it's predecessor. If I had a tablet device, this would be an app that I would definitely download.
B00596WEVI|4.0|I'm glad to say that this isn't a Van Damme movie but a movie with Van Dame in it. Ever since I saw him in JCVD, and realized he could actually act, I was hoping he would be in better projects. Lo and behold, here it is.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Van Damme is a hit man for hire. Scott Adkins is a hit man retired to take care of his comatose wife, who was put into the coma by a really bad guy. Van Damme takes a contract on said bad guy for big bucks. Adkins wants in on the hit for revenge. The two form an uncomfortable alliance to do the job. There's a bit more but why spoil.<br /><br />This is a cool, if derivative story. Some of the plot points you've seen before. What's happening here is the fact that it's all rather un-sensational. The fights are neat and tough. No jumping around with impossible kicks and such. The Van Damme character is quiet and reserved. He handles his hits like a professional (with one grave exception), gets paid and pursues the things he likes. He's a bit anal retentive but it doesn't get in the way of things. The Adkins character is also quiet. He lives off in the country and spends much of his time taking care of his wife. Both men are assured in their abilities to perform. No strutting or posturing. Just get the job done and get out.<br /><br />This is shot and cut well. The performances are decent and it's directed well. It's not great art but it is good craft. If you like a mature, tight action flick you could do a lot worse.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this is a great game it really is more of a puzzle game than any other but its actually fun,  its challenging but if you cant figure it out it gives you helpfull hints its really fun
B0009VRHLK|2.0|I'm not sure that this could be considered a movie as much as a total and complete waste of time and an insult to intelligence. I detected nothing that even resembled a story, nothing that would qualify as acting and a total lack of creativity. There is, however, lots of footage of the leading man/director/cameraman & editor driving down some of America's nicest highways. Filler no doubt. The scenery surrounding said highways being the only interesting feature of this \\"movie?\\". The \\"star\\" of this flick plays a man, no, a worm wallowing in gross self pity while wearing a demented facial expression throughout, ending up on a bed in a fetal position and sobbing like a fool. Watch this flick if you have absolutely nothing better to do. I do mean absolutely nothing.
B000FC272M|1.0|Apparently, Amazon is selling a Kindle version of Penguin edition. Nevertheless, it is a sloppy edition by digireads, without introduction, index or explanatory notes. Since this is a work in the public domain, that can be found for free in respectable internet sites that offer classics in Kindle format, it is not acceptable to charge any money for it, unless it comes with some additional value. For less than what it is asked for this, you can get, also from Amazon, the complete Stevenson's works in a neat edition, perfectly formatted and with good indexes (Delphi Classics).
B007N5YIUS|1.0|This will not start on Nexus One. It crashes at start up. please fix. I love the other Birds games.
0439861306|5.0|Great book. Actually lives up to the hype. Fun reading in it's simplest form. No uber-pretty people, no ridiculous preaching on one of the authors pet issues. Just good human growth the natural and normal way; through living.<br /><br />What kind of hero is Percy Jackson: He's the Odysseus, Fox, Miles Vorkosigan type trickster. He's not going to win my beating someone into submission with a handy school bus, but he in no way lacks courage or strong convictions and the will to act on them.<br /><br />Great book.

031603438X|5.0|Keith's book opens with a roar, which is a very wild tale of struggles with the law (one of many), and moves quickly into his early life and the formation of The Rolling Stones.  It reads like a a gypsy's diary, and is a fascinating read.  I, along with many, am amazed that Keith's still alive (though thankful) given his penchant for drugs.<br /><br />I loved the back stories on how some of the best Stone's songs came about, and how Keith came to his unique approach to guitar.  That, too me, was fascinating.<br /><br />All the characters that come and go, are like a stroll down desolation row, funny, tragic, crazy.<br /><br />The band struggles were tough, but I'm grateful that they worked through them, and somehow think those struggles added to some of the Stone's music.<br /><br />This is a story that isn't over yet, I'm sure there's much more to come.<br /><br />Life took me on a bumpy road trip with Mr. Richards that I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />All I can say is \\"thanks mate\\"!
B000002LJW|5.0|when this came out i said it was grammy worthy and it was this the top of the line recoeding great guitar rifs it just keeps jammin from start to finish
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The Shades of Grey series is kind of a scam. My biggest problem with the entire series is that these 3 books combined only have enough content for 1 book, but the publisher cleverly broke it out into a \\"series\\" so that if you want to finish reading the story you have to pay 3 times. This has also allowed them not to work very hard at editing the book. If you read the 1 and 2 star reviews you will see the complaint of \\"repetitive phrases\\" over and over. It is a very legitimate complaint, the entire story is very repetitive.<br /><br />I bought and read this book because of all of the praise and press. Now having read the series I cannot believe that legitimate news sources have done stories on this book which is nothing more than an oversexed harlequin romance. If you are on the fence, don't bother to buy it. You aren't missing much.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|When is the free version coming out? I would buy it but my mom doesn't want me to buy more stuff.I have the aneroid market too on my Fire and it says incompatible with the free one, but it says it works with the paid one.
B0034G4P80|4.0|This was a very enjoyable addition to the Marvel series of movies.  There were a lot of funny scenes as well as plenty of action, and the over the top ending.  Fun!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|the neeed for random strangers to be your friend makes the fun factor slide down fast for a while. however with only those limits set on it.. this is a very fun game.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry birds space is a great phisics game and is great for children that are learning about gravity. I highly recommend this for creative kids. I don't reccomend this for sporty kids.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I played the flash game version before, but this one is far superior. There are even more elements and game modes. And it runs well on Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has a lot of different types of games so there is something for everyone. If you want a time waster then this is it.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|Couldn't put this book down - read it in three days! Absolutely fantastic. The unexpected twists and turns throughout the novel were such a shock! Loved it

B006ON41FC|3.0|the game is pretty good, and pretty addictive(: I think the graphics could be better, but that's just me and my opinion
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I could not put this book down.It is fast moving from start to finish and at the end i have a big laugh and curse Jeffery Archer for how the story ended.<br /><br />The plot is good and you keep wondering where all the characters will meet and whether Emma finds Harry, If they marry and who will get the inheritance.<br /><br />Harry Clifton becomes Tom Bradshaw and end in prison so that he can disappear from Emma Barringtons life whom he loves.Giles Barrington is to be in line for the Barringtonton estate but also Harry is to be as he is meant to be the illigitamate son of Hugo Barrington making Harry a step brother to both Giles and Emma.<br /><br />Apparently this is book 2 so i must read \\"Only Time Will Tell\\".
B005LAJ22Q|1.0|Love the show, but i absolutely HATE how Anchor Bay handles DVD/BR releases with their notorious trend for double/tripple-dipping. they always have, always will, especially with anything zombie-related (i.e. their constant re-releasing new versions of the Evil Dead films)<br /><br />keep in mind the special edition with all the goodies/extras for Walking Dead Season One came out FOUR MONTHS LATER after the barebones edition. you know they are just bound to pull the same crap with Season Two and all future seasons of the show. for Anchor Bay, it's all about how much extra $$$ they can squeeze out of you. don't fall for it.<br /><br />TL;DR: DO NOT BUY, WAIT FOR THE S.E.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|TALK ABOUT EXPENSIVE!!!! Sure I love angry birds. it is like, the best invention ever. bu I am definitely not buying the same thing with some space theme for 3 stinking bucks!!!! its the same thing with just a space twist.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I loved this show when it was on.  I missed many of the episodes back then.  When it came back on to TV Land and another channel as well, I started DVR'ing it.  The episodes were no way in order and it really left me missing what came next.  So I bought the whole episode.  That is the way to go.  I love this show.  It is really a family show with family values and lessons.  I have read that they tried to keep it as real as possible and that adds to the show too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After opening this book I did not stop reading until I had finished the 3rd and final book in this series. You are captivated by this story and the emotions of Catniss Everdeen and what the poor people of the Districts go through for survival. I couldn't wait for the next chapter or the next book for that matter! Def worth your time and attention to fall into the pages of the Hunger Games.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I honestly find the book very good, though not for everyone. I am glad to see a fanfiction author come through and get a chance at publishing as there are so many good ones out there that never get that opportunity (lisalu). So good for you and I look forward to reading the rest!!<br />For the boo-haters, if you not in to romances with sexual situations, then the book if not for you, seriously, not for you. So don't bother buying or reading you will just end up hating it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I didn't watch this show when it first came out because I really don't watch the CW...but I happened to be flipping through channels one day and there was season 1 marathon on and I watched it from start to finish.I was so anxious to find out when the next season would come on,and Ive been watching it ever since. Great actors/actresses..They are all beautiful,handsome,sexy,and talented. Just a really great cast and great storylines.I'm sorry but the twilight movies have NOTHING on this show.It's really good and the story lines always make sense(i hate when shows i like have storylines that dont make sense or the writers have all these bloopers.)  WATCH IT!!You won't be disappointed.  :)
B005OOSPZO|5.0|The Blu-Ray version of Tora, Tora, Tora is amazing.  The picture and sound quality brought a whole new appreciation for this film, much better, in my opinion, than the original DVD version.  If a \\"war buff\\" then you be pleased you purchased this for your movie collection.
B002KT3XH6|4.0|I read this book after watching the series \\"The Tudors\\" on Netflix and loved the author's effort to report historical accuracy.  This book read like a novel instead of a biography.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys nonfiction and history.
B0060ZJ74O|2.0|Moneyball is a waste of 2 hours of your life. The production is terrible. Pathetic cinematography. The story is a 20-minute documentary spread very thin. The acting is weak. High school thespians could do as well. Brad Pitt looks and acts wasted.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|This is awful- slow to start and kept getting worse- I am a total Charlize Theron fan- very disappointed, could not wait for it to end.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|101-in-1 Games is a very fun and addicting app; however, the adds on the game are highly annoying. Not only do the adds show on top and bottom of your screen, but the also pop up in the middle of a game. For all you graphic geeks, the graphics on this game are very low, so I wouldn't recommend this game if your anal over slight glitching. Another problem is that as you beat the games to unlock more games, it might take you multiple times on one game to gain enough coins for the next one. Overall, this game is a pretty average game, but as a free app, there's not much to lose.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I &lt;3 this game so much!! When I got it, I was nonstop playing it!! It doesn't crash on my kindle fire and it works like a charm! definently recommend it!!
B006X9EUUS|2.0|As a long time fan of Sinead from The Lion and the Cobra and everything after, this CD was very disappointing.<br />Lyrically, musically, everything. So sad to see a great lady fall. Hopefully one day she can return.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished the Wool Omnibus Edition and loved almost every word. Well written and absorbing. I felt immersed in the book from the first steps the Sheriff takes up the stairs.  Hugh Howey has created a world that you will come to know and will want to revisit.  I can't wait until the next book is complete! Way under priced for what you get.
B006ON41FC|3.0|This is a good app but it that a lot of optimization issues I'm on nexus s and it regularly freezes up. The game play is good.

B004MNO0BQ|5.0|The only problem is that the difficulty gap between Hard and Insane is a little too much. Other than that, it's perfect.<br /><br />Maybe make a new difficulty called Insane and call what you have as Insane right now Impossible. Or Crazy and Insane, since some people (other than me) may be able to beat Insane.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|In a future time, every year \\"The Hunger Games\\" are run by the government. Meant to be a punishment to a number of districts that tried to rise up against the government, the games have become great entertainment to the people of the time. Each year a boy and a girl from each district who are from 12 to 17 years old are chosen to fight to the death until only one is left alive. When her 12 year old sister is chosen, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to save her sister.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this movie was: Survivor meets Running Man meets The Truman Show meets The Bachelor.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars (and would have given 4 1/2 if Amazon allowed) because there was a bit too much predictability in the script. Otherwise it was a brilliant production.<br /><br />SciFi fans will love the amazing look and feel of this future world. It's a brutal world of people divided into the \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots.\\" The \\"have nots\\" are penned in, suppressed and live in poverty while the \\"haves\\" live in luxury and are so hard hearted that they enjoy watching children kill each other for sport. It was believable.<br /><br />The sets were utterly amazing. The clothing, hair styles, make up, and culture of this future society were like nothing else I've seen elsewhere. There should be some awards there. The acting was also spot on.<br /><br />You're led through the process of the Hunger Games, with the movie focusing on Katniss Everdeen from start to finish. Like watching Survivor on TV, you quickly decide who you can cheer for, and who you hope to see fail. It's easy to care about Katniss, since she's a kind hearted girl who's instincts are to protect the vulnerable. There were also villain type characters that were easy to hate.<br /><br />There was a bit of romance in the movie, but it wasn't the focus of the film.<br /><br />This movie is NOT for kids, or even young teens in my opinion. Children are killed, and there is blood in this movie. The violence sequences are made a bit less gory by the use of \\"cinema verte\\" or \\"shakey cam\\" with fast moving cuts. Regardless, this is not appropriate for kids or the sensitive.<br /><br />So to conclude, I'd certainly recommend this movie to SciFi fans and action/adventure fans.ory by the use of \\"cinema verte\\" or \\"shakey cam\\" with fast moving cuts.

0312370849|4.0|I was very moved by this story. This is not meant to be a spoiler review so I will just say that the entire book was excellent until the very end when the reader is left hanging. The long question of \\"will a certain event happen\\" is never answered satisfactorily. I prefer books that tie up loose ends and give me a feeling of closure. It is still worth reading though.
0062014102|5.0|A must-read for anyone contemplating the nature of reality. Mr. Talbot has amassed a comprehensive, fascinating, and balanced collection of information, with every page offering fresh and relevant insights into what, where, and how we are. Additionally, it is literary, engaging, and well-written, with a true writer's eye. I very much enjoyed the book's narrative, and quick, precise style, not to mention its abundant substance.<br /><br />I originally read this book eight years ago, when I was in a very different place mentally. The text struck me even then, by the sheer possibilities contained within; however, upon recently rereading it, I saw it with new eyes, shocked. The theories and contemplations in this book echo almost exactly my experience in the interim between my first reading the book, and rereading it. So precise are these similarities, I can't help but to add it to the collection of experiential and empirical evidence I've amassed regarding the nature of reality. (If I weren't so skeptical and objective in evaluating my own experience, I might conclude that, after my first reading it, the book subconsciously shaped my perception of future events!)<br /><br />My only criticism of the text is in regards to its presentation of evidence. While the book does, prudently, keep its conclusions conservative and open-ended (the hallmark of all truth-seeking), there are several times where scientific evidence is presented as factual, with assumptions and deductions made from this. Though this is rare, it is contradictory to the book's acknowledgement that scientific evidence is, by nature, fundamentally questionable, because of the very theses and postulations presented within (namely that scientific evidence lacks any real means of validation, due to factors such as expectation, observance, and perception, as well as our crippled perspective in the scheme of things, which equates to us analyzing an instrument by using the instrument). That said, this is a minor point, only mentionable for reasons of objectivity. The keen, vigilant reader will note these incidences, and amend their conclusions appropriately.<br /><br />I am very grateful for this book, as it has greatly facilitated my knowledge and awareness, as much eight years ago as now. Thank you, Mr. Talbot!
B002ZG977Y|2.0|This is one of those movies where you watch it one time and you never want to see it again. The best part of the movie was when they fought the giant creature that came out the ocean. One cool part I like is when the gods were watching over the world,the special effects were not bad either. Overall I think these type of new age films with the special computer effects are movies you just watch one time and thats it.
0756686970|5.0|My 5 yo is obsessed with this book! We originally borrowed it from the library, but his baby brother got ahold of it and  injured the binding. We bought the library a new copy and kept the damaged one. My son spent a good 2 months reading the falling apart book as he lost pages here and there. He would seriously read it for hours each day. Finally we decided it was time to get him a new copy. Worth every penny!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty fun. I am writing this review for more points. but yeah its cool. um... I need to say more words. oh there we go!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|So, the first book (or short), Wool 1, was fantastic. I LOVED it and was immediately intrigued at this new world filled with deception and control. The last book in the series, #5, was also a page turner. I could picture everything so vividly in my mind because of the great writing and could see this being a popular science fiction movie one day. Both of those books deserve 5 star ratings. The other three books, while interesting, never really grabbed me the way the middle and end did and I would rate them with 3 stars.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this series and look forward to reading more from Hugh Howey. I intend on reading some of his other books very soon. It isn't often that you get an author who writes good sci-fi/dystopian fiction that isn't weighed down with cliches and crappy love triangles. Since the first and last would be a 5 star rating and the middle books would be a 3 star rating, I stayed right in the middle with a solid 4.

B005M48WNQ|4.0|I think most people know they have a problem with how our food gets to us (if not concerns with whether it's ethical to eaten certain kinds of it at all). But we do our best to push it from the front of our minds - we know about but never watch those horrific slaughterhouse abuse videos, we roll up the window when we pass massive pig and cattle farms - because we'd rather not deal with consequences of examining those feelings.<br /><br />Foer's book on factory farming and the larger issue of eating meat took me almost a month to make sense of my choices after reading. When I finished thinking, I gave up eating factory-farmed meat entirely. The only meat I consume comes from Frank Reese's heritage turkeys and chickens (featured in the book) and Niman Ranch (you can also track down Niman's new farm, BN Ranch but I haven't yet). I think what I liked about Foer is his ability to articulate the nuance of an issue but still be blunt and honest enough to dismiss those details as irrelevant in the face of larger issues. To me, that issue is whether you can be aware and proud of the decisions you make about something like food or eating meat. And then it's important that you move on and address and improve another area of your life.

B003XMWSSY|4.0|While the book itself definitely merited four stars--and I agree with other positive reviews, the formatting on this book somehow left it a monolith among molehills when it comes to file size. Most ebooks are 500-1000K. When I bought this book, I forgot to check the size (something I generally only due with books possibly containing pictures--which there are no pictures other than the cover page.) It's 16,732 K! Not only did it practically kill my poor Kindle 2 to download, but I actually read it in the cloud so I could take notes without my Kindle crawling.<br /><br />If you have an older Kindle or your Kindle bogs down with the larger files, you might want to just buy the paper copy of this book. It's worth it but, yikes, it's huge. (TWSS)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Downloaded and installed on my Epic Touch Samsung II s just fine.<br />Played just as well as on the PC if not better because of the touch screen.<br />The graphic quality is high res and looks stunning on the phone. Sound is good too. Quite amazing, frankly.<br /><br />This version does not have Michael Jackson but it's not their fault really nor did i see any mini games.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|good game with awesome levels but I think it cost to much maybe but its still fun even though I love it
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Angry Birds has been a big hit and this new addition to the series doesn't disappoint. The game makes use of realistic physics by making gravity fields that sling birds around moons and planets while maintaining a straight trajectory outside of an objects' gravity. I did take a star off as tablet owners are stuck with the standard definition version unless you want to shell out three bucks for the HD version. Other than that this is an awesome game that I'm sure will consume a lot of my time...
B007MNV5WU|3.0|On the Kindle Fire it looks and plays great, but if your not connected to wifi you have to set your date and time, not have it set in auto. The game will set your clock to 12:00 Jan 1st 2000, which causes it and every other app you own to crash. Once this is fixed 5 stars for sure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just downloaded app and I love it yes there are some ads but not bad at all! I say download it great when ur bored!!!

B003R0LBVW|4.0|This is an easy to read novel telling the complex story of several generations of an American family. Imbedded in the tale are several standard moral issues (ecological, political and personal) which ask the reader to take a stand on some important choices.  While the book is very skillfully crafted but perhaps slightly longer than necessary, it is both enjoyable and thought provoking.  It would be an excellent choice for most book clubs to read and discuss.
B0000248VB|5.0|Great album!  All the great movie and TV themes you've heard all your life in one spot. My only disappointment is that one piece is not the version from the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read many books but the Hunger Games takes the cake. The combo of romance,action,and sci-fi is incredible. I am currenty 12 and the is a YA book. I still think it is one of the most appropriate. Not a single cuss word and even though there is romance it isn't that innappropriate. The connection you feel to Katniss is incredible, The pacing is just right, and it leaves you wanting more. Great book if you want your tween or teen to start reading. And if you are a tween or teen...Buy the book. NOW! :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a great way to pass the time! and a wide variety of games to choose from too!
B00003CXAA|5.0|not only a great story,from the minds of mario puzo and francis ford coppola. but perhaps the most quotable trio of films ever.watched over and over, you're drawn in by the dynamic characters. from marlon brando, who was already a big star, to deniro, pacino,diane keaton,et al you watch as many become future big time stars. you can't get past brando who was terrific as vito corleone and he lived \\"cool\\" and even died spectacularly. al pacino took over where brando left off. he became more brutal once he became powerful and not only killed his enemies but he took down his own brother (john cazzale as fredo).when he finally realizes the errors in his ways he pays big time

0545405777|4.0|In summary, The Hunger Games is a trilogy set in a future North America, now known as Panem. Canada, the United States and Mexico have given way to twelve districts, thirteen if you count the nuclear remnant that used to exist before the Capitol leveled the area for insurrection, and it was because of this attempted uprising that Panem now holds an annual televised competition to remind citizens that the Capitol is still in charge.<br /><br />At its most basic, the competition is set in a natural arena where two teenagers (one boy and one girl) from twelve districts kill each other until one survives. But, when Katniss Everdeen from District 12 enters the gruesome contest, a subversive plot long in the making begins to take shape.<br /><br />I told myself I would only read the first book in the trilogy. The idea of children killing each other is a bit gruesome even for my appetite, part of the reason I have not motivated myself to read American Psycho. Maybe I'm too soft for it, but you have to possess a certain mindset to read about such elevated violence, let alone write it. The Hunger Games was neither excessive nor explicit. It gave you the details you needed to know and moved on like a good narrative should. Collins, I think, got the perfect balance between intrigue and moderation.<br /><br />I liked the series because it found a creative way to spotlight reality. I think people will criticize the series on face, because they find themselves reluctant to move past the basic premise that the trilogy sacrifices children to make a point. For me, the greater hesitance is our refusal to accept the reality that either already exists or is just around the corner.<br /><br />Countries really do sacrifice their children to wage war. Were this not true, we would not be attempting to battle the plight of child soldiers from Sudan and other third world countries. They no more have a choice than the children did in Collins' novel. In some societies, it is preferable to jointhe military to have a hope for survival than to starve or die, and although campaigns like Invisible Children have done a fantastic job of bringing attention to the issue, the subject will never be the stuff of prime time television, not until it is dressed up in a way that sells.<br /><br />The public is obsessed with reality television. Unfortunately, too often ratings are driven by the kind of drama that spills over into private lives, and we can't get enough of it. But, what's great about Jon and Kate Plus 8 resulting in a broken home? What is the wow factor behind Russell Armstrong's suicide from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills? Maybe it all got started with Jerry Springer, or maybe the explosion of television and Internet access has created a private means of feeding our primitive curiosities--private, that is, until the media says it's okay for us to jump in with both feet and publically proclaim our admiration for what was once considered out of bounds.<br /><br />There was a time when we were careful. It used to be that sex and strong language did not have a place in mainstream media. Now, it's a key ingredient that separates the good from the great. The Hunger Games is based around a television show, and while there is a tremendous gap between murder contests and survival on a private island, we can't deny that productions like Faces of Death generated widespread notoriety in the 90's, even before Youtube was conceived. How much of A Brave New World and 1984 have already panned out?<br /><br />I don't have a problem with the way Collins uses art to imitate reality. We should be aware of the direction our society is headed. Authors should write whatever they want. After all, they wouldn't write what we don't buy.<br /><br />I disagree, however, that The Hunger Games belongs in the young adult category. The fact that the books feature young adults does not make them prime for a young adult audience. The fact that some of the book's context has been dumbed down to stay within PG 13 range negates the fact that unlike a book, a movie leaves very little to a child's imagination. It's our responsibility as writers to determine who will be impacted by our works. Of course, this does not detract from the other parties we should hold responsible. If we want our children to be immune to the influences of such works of fiction and grow up to be good adults, we should invest in better parents.<br /><br />Collins is not the first to delve into dystopia, but if Stephen King's The Long Walk and Running Man escaped the wrath of the moral police, it is because his books were never marketed as the latest teenage craze. Harry Potter and Twilight should not give authors a green light to put lipstick on the grotesque and call it appropriate for our most impressionable members of society, because in middle school and high school, we're not engineered to look beneath the surface. We're wired to roll with things at face value, and yes, at the surface of The Hunger Games is a story of government sanctioned massacre and a celebration of young lust.<br /><br />If my former assertions are correct, that society is gradually reverting to primitive fascinations and is using pop entertainment to justify its decline, then it shouldn't matter if The Hunger Games is being swapped on college campuses or kindergarten classrooms, but I have not given up on the basic noble nature of humanity. We are not savages, and perhaps books like these are meant to forewarn us of what society could be like if we don't do something to prevent it. Dystopia is nothing more than a depiction of society evolving faster than our spiritual capacity, but our spiritual capacity is there, alive and well if we are willing to exercise it for something good.<br /><br />These are just a few things the trilogy prompted in my mind. The work itself was well written, though it could have ended on a stronger note. I think Collins found herself struggling to keep up the momentum ofthe action, and in doing so, I found a few unnecessary scenes and haphazard developments that did not need to be a part of the book to make it shine. Even so, I strongly recommend mature adults pick it up and give it a shot. It's futuristic science fiction without the bland sophistication of George Orwell. And, it's the type of controversial literature that stimulates important discussions we might otherwise  have skipped.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|The way that Steam goes on the Kindle Fire is in fact quite engaging, but without playing games. It's kind of a social app for social people. Maybe I could have gave this app a 3 star rating for a lack of games.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I enjoy the goals. They make the game fun and challenging. It's a fun time waster that easy to put down and easy to pick up again.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I originally overstated how good this album is. This is the most fun I've had listening to an new record in years. So many of the songs are exactly what we want to hear from Van Halen: masculine, taunting, unrestrained in-your-face swagger.  However they did it, they retrieved the attitude that permeated their music in the mid and late seventies. The guitar is front and center, Roth smirks his way through every song, and the drumming is never repetitive. The recording engineer has made it sound like you're in the room with them; he avoided the over-reverbed attempts to sound like you're in a big auditorium that actually toned-down some of their previous albums (II, Women and Children First, OU812). So half the songs were written before 1978. Maybe that suggests that the interpretation of what hard rock is supposed to sound like peaked 35 years ago. Nothing wrong with that.  Someone should lock them in a room with John Shanks, the producer, and force them to produce another 12 songs while the iron is hot.
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|Unless you couldn't care less about the digital copy of the movie (which I actually do care about), avoid anything with an Ultraviolet \\"copy\\" like the plague.  The so-called \\"service\\" is buggy and just a poorly disguised attempt at DRM.  Give me an iTunes copy in the future or I won't be buying your discs anymore.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|the additional download is pretty annoying.....otherwise it seems like a good game. classic with basic rules. i like it. i recommend it if you're willing to fork over the additional memory.

1419702238|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a granddaughter who loves this series of books.  She had all of them except this one so I was glad to be able to find it and at a good price.  Delivery was on time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I seriously enjoyed the first two installments, so much so that I devoured them in less than two days. I eagerly began this one and still felt the same enthusiasm - right up until the final two chapters. And that's where Collin's lost me. In a shift so sudden and startling, it wrapped things up with that pretty-little-bow happy ending, when I was looking forward the the Capitol Tributes (with the assistance of the surviving Games tributes) turning on Coin to bring an end to the over-indulgence of those in power; it felt as if the author had grown weary of the telling of her own tale. A disappointing wrap-up to a great tale.
B004T32SOK|5.0|love the box app I can access my content from anywhere! would like to have even more in.app.editing features. looking for the next version to have even more

B00000DFRS|5.0|I purchased this cd right after Whitney passed away in honor of her and her family. When the cd arrived to my house I swear I must have listened to the cd for 2 weeks straight I couldn't stop listening to it. My favorite song is \\"It's not right, but it's okay\\". I remember the first time I heard this song so I had to have this cd.
B004EPZ07U|2.0|This should have been so much better.  all of the scenes that happened in space were well done and enjoyable, but the movie deflated every time the story returned to Earth. The writing was bad, and the effects budget seemed misplaced.  Why was the villain a giant cloud monster?  We've already seen how poorly that worked with Galactus in FF.  Why did the scene with the helicopter take up so much time when it was so lame?  Why was there wind in space?<br /><br />Save your money and watch Thor or Captain America again, or wait for the Dark Knight Rises to hit theaters this summer.  DC really needs to take some lessons from how Marvel has been handling their movies, or at least reference their own playbook on what has made the Batman movies so successful since Nolan took over.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|DUST BOWL is a mind-bending piece of modern blues-rock magic.  From blues rock to blues, to blues with a dash of country-fried melodies thrown in, this album defies easy classification, which is one of its strengths. The title track alone is worth the cost of purchase.  Check this out.  If you're into blues, blues rock, progressive guitar rock, or just good music, this album is for you.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|is the only word I could come up with if I am asked to describe M+A+S using one word. Vuelve was a great album, but I can't say that ALL the selections were amazing. M+A+S--all selections are amazing. This CD has everything to make you dance, sing, cheer, and cry. I am sure that this has to do with the difference 6 years makes in the technology of recording, but the sound is and production is a cut above any music out there.<br /><br />Or perhaps it's the fact that I have waited so long for Ricky to put out some new work. But I think that Ricky's sound on M+A+S is really more that he is a maturing, emotionally safe, self-accepting, self-loving and honorable man whose voice seems to get better with age, fatherhood and time--not to mention that at 40 Ricky's better looking and better built than ever!<br /><br />It seems that these qualities helped to produce music that engenders a variety of emotions from one song to the next. Both of the duets on this CD are fun to sing along to. He has great duet partners in Natalie and Joss Stone. Sera Sera a fun dance song with tight beats. Shine one of only the 2 songs he sings in English, is an optimistic song of love and fun to listen to. Frio is a funky piece in both versions that makes you want to dance. Tu Y Yo cannot be accurately described in words, it has to be felt--A love song no doubt to a soul mate. It's like a poem to music, evoking the wonder of of true love and the impossibility task to describe it using human words.<br /><br />But it is Basta Ya that is the most emotionally provocative, moving of M+A+S. It seems to point to Ricky's process of coming to love himself. It might well have been written before Ricky \\"hit the send\\" button that announce to the world that he had enough of fear and self-hatred. I listen to it often--we all have fears and suffer self-hatred at many points in our lives. Basta Ya's message is for all of us.<br /><br />Thank you Ricky!

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have had this app for 2 days now and it is phenomenal. It was definately worth all the hyper and is a great buy for anyone who wants a great way to pass some time. The graphics are really good on my kindle and in my opinion it is the best angry birds they have made so far.
B0060ZJ74O|1.0|This is a very disappointing movie that is hardly worth the time to view it. Don't waste your time and money.
B0033B5XCS|4.0|I brought this and I love it but it has freddy vs Jason and from the reviews it's supposed to have a bonus rom disc instead of Freddy vs Jason as the 8th disc. Just found it odd.
0439023521|2.0|With all the hype surrounding this book and the movie, I decided to read (screen) the book before allowing it into the hands of my 12 and 13 year old children. The book has a couple of redeeming qualities. First, it does an excellent job proving out the depravity of mankind. It is not hard to imagine that some the concepts in this book could become reality (in some ways they already are). Second, in a world without God, it makes perfect sense that the characters are disillusioned, dysfunctional, and have no problems with killing each other. These are lessons worth teaching children, but this book is probably not the best way to do that.<br /><br />This book is about children killing children and it's about the failure of their parents and/or adults standing up to defend their children (for fear of their own death). It's about a teenage girl offering herself as a substitute \\"sacrifice\\" for her 12-year-old sister with no intervention from the girl's mother or from \\"friends.\\" This book suggests no hope, no moral lessons, and nothing of redeeming value save learning what a godless, depraved society might look like. The popularity of this book and the movie make it clear why we see so many incidents of children killing children in our society today. The children who perform these acts have no hope. Who will tell them there is hope? I recommend reading the Bible instead. It's got lots of killing, but there is a redemptive message of hope thread throughout for those who are willing to accept it.<br /><br />My children will not be reading this book, nor will we see the movie.
B00101ZK76|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was living in Paris in 1993. I loved it. And it's become my number one film of all time. I can't quite put my finger on why exactly. I could talk about the pace of the film, the abstract, but human storyline, the incredible performances and directing job, but that would deny YOU the VIEWER, the actual joy of formulating your own impression. It IS brilliant, funny, quirky, etc., etc... and the reason why I'm writing this review is to encourage you to rent it, if you haven't already seen it. That's all. Just see it. Goo Goo Ga Joob.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We waited until we could watch the last 2 movies (Deathly Hallows 1 & 2) in sequence and not miss a thing. We were not disappointed. It's nice to watch the entire collection in order without any commercials again and again. It's a great product at an amazing price. Thanks again Amazon...
0061148512|5.0|So much has been written about this novel, so I won't belabor its excellences, except to say that it contains a good deal of humor that some readers seem to miss since they call the work depressing. I recommend listening to Maggie Gyllenhaal's audio book narration of the novel. You can hear the humor in her voice.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|This was a great product at one time. Now its slow it stalls and loads PDF files very slow. Docs to go seems alot faster.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|A very well written and easily readable account of the reasons that caused the huge drop in the housing market that was the root cause of the recent deep recession.  If you do not know what \\"moral hazard\\" is, you will learn not only what is it is, but what happens when is runs amok in the financial markets and why greed is one of the seven deadly sins.

B0051QJ83S|1.0|My God this \\"Lady\\" already sounds so old (and tawdry)! This album sounds like a poor effort of end career. There is no elegance, no search for anything new...just huge amounts of sounds and effects, and when it comes to create something that could be a melody...it sounds so old (and tawdry)! Already...
1451648537|5.0|You will enjoy this book from cover to cover whether you liked Steve Jobs or not, enjoy Apple products or not.  This is an amazing tale of a complex American business visionary that made a profound difference in an industry and a company that have in one way or another touched most of our lives in one way or another.  The author did a brilliant job showing the good the bad and the ugly of Steve Jobs while taking the reader through the journey of Jobs life from being adopted as a baby, searching for himself through the use of drugs and meditation, his journey into India and eventually becoming much more than the CEO of several American companies including Apple and Pixar, but the man that shaped computing, graphic interface, telephones, movies and more for many years to come. The book touches on Jobs the absent father, the quirky fetishes and odd relationship with Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. Fascinating tale.

B004JK61K0|3.0|This expands on the standard Android email client, but doesn't offer enough function outside of just email for business user like myself.  I have removed this app and paid the price to load Touchdown.  I have also tried Moxier client, but Touchdown offered \\"MS Office\\" like experience with the email client resembling Outlook with calendar, notes, etc, all synced via Exchange server. Moxier is more Android-like with similar capabilities, but with a friendlier search function in Contacts.<br /><br />Not recommended for business users, especially if your email server is Exchange with corporate MDM security policy.  Recommend Touchdown or Moxier instead.
B0010358CQ|4.0|(if you have questions...feel free and ask)<br />Part of the Appleseed saga of movies, games, manga, and Tv show; \\"Ex Machina\\" served as a worthy and spectacular addition to \\"the family\\". But of course, first the content stuff...<br /><br />FOR PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED FOLKS...<br />This movie is actually a pretty clean movie. There's no nudity or situations warranting that (I'm sure that should be a clear enough statement). In fact, the clothing is much more conservative in comparison to what some of the characters from the previous CGI Appleseed wore. There are some language issues to take note of. D-word is pretty common in the early 3rd of the movie. B-word is pretty much used about 5 times from an enraged criminal trying to fight his way from arrest. F-word is used once. Violence-wise, it's not as vicious (crushed heads...literally) as the first Appleseed movie...but it's still as action packed and visually artistic as ever. Besides that, there's not much else to worry or be concerned about. Thematically, it's not as deep as the first one, but still some things worth musing and contemplating over. Teenagers and older can enjoy this.<br /><br />MOVING ON...<br />\\"Appleseed Ex Machina\\" is a beautifully rendered film dealing with the issues about the essence of humanity, security, love, and unity. You do not need to be familiar with every \\"Appleseed\\" film/manga to enjoy...not even the prequel movie. Though of course, if you are familiar, then you can glean more from it. But, they do make sure to give you good and unobtrusive flashbacks to help you understand details that newcomers to the franchise would miss. In fact, this was my first \\"Appleseed\\". The CG is majorly improved from the first one.  In fact, there it is vastly improved on the visual emotions factor...much more believable...if u like animation in general, that alone is captivating. If anime characters could ever exist in the real world, it would be something like this. But the animators, producers, and director do not rely on the vastly improved animation quality to carry it. Instead of focusing the audience towards the amazing wow factor of the CG, they use the graphics to subtly create a very vibrant and living world. They immerse the audience through a futuristic fantasy world that you can't help but fall in love with. From the birthday parties to walking down the street...even minor details in the scenery and social ambience was carefully and lovingly crafted. Also, the English dubs are actually very brilliant and matching to the characters...one of my favorite dubbing jobs. Also, there are tons of action sequences and they aren't just \\"spun together\\". They are very well crafted...and a narrative in of itself in some ways. On top of that, it's not only artistic, but strangely believable (even though some things are blatantly not reality).<br /><br />Story:<br />As far as the story is concerned. It's not as deep as the previous movie. But that does not mean it's no less good. The tale is very cohesive and well thought out. The pacing is good...no moments where you feel like, \\"get on with it!\\". Every moment serves a complimentary purpose to the film. Some minor plot twists as well. Also, just like the previous film, it deals with themes. However, I will say that it's execution of them are good, but nothing that will \\"raise the bar\\". Still, I loved the overall narrative and the way it was executed...and still good lessons to learn from it. Also, the allusions to Greek mythology really adds so much to it...though subtly.<br /><br />There are some fun special features as well. They include a documentary about the teaming up of John Woo (a Hong Kong action movie legend) and Shinji Aramaki (an anime power house) for this project, another documentary about the advances in animation & dubbing process that helped bring more life to the film...that was my favorite special (very eye-opening and you garner much more respect for the people who worked on it), and the usual filmmaker's commentary. Good and fun stuff.<br /><br />ALL IN ALL<br />\\"Appleseed Ex Machina\\" is a beautifully rendered film taking place in a very engaging and immersive world. It's not particularly profound, but it's not completely without meat. An excellent lighter experience mixed with good storytelling and vibrant visuals. Definitely worth a shot.al filmmaker's commentary.

1400095204|3.0|The title comes from the emblem of the shortlived Biafran state (1967-70); in this book we see the lead up to and result of this time of turmoil in Africa through the eyes of a group of bourgeois Nigerians. There are two wealthy sisters, their spouses (one a rather feeble British ex-pat, the other a Nigerian intellectual) and their servants.<br />It was an interesting read and I learned a lot on a topic I knew little about. But I felt that because we see these terrible events through the eyes of those with influence, it somehow cushions the reader. Although our characters undergo the horrors of air raids and have to move into grotty accommodation, their wealthy parents abroad and friends in high places are looking out for them.<br />I also felt that Adichie writes in a very reserved and distant manner. A character undergoes an experience, we see their reaction but exactly what s/he is thinking and feeling is not revealed.<br />The result for me was that a book set amid what was termed the worst disaster since WW2 kind of washed over me.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I tried downloading this damn thing three times and it never downloaded to my kindle. I am not sure what is wrong with it but now I have to try and buy them all separately which is going to cost more. So far buying books for the kindle through the kindle sucks.I am very disappointed and wish I would have got a nook instead.
0439023521|4.0|I bought this for my son and we love a lot of the same books like \\"The Hobbit,\\" and \\"Song of Ice and Fire,\\" and I think I have spent about $1500.00 this year on Amazon purchases.<br />When I ordered it I saw it hailed as the \\"next Twlight,\\" and my heart sank. I saw it was published by Scholastic, and then thought maybe it was too young a read for us. But I havent been able to put it down. It has some very deep undertones and the suspense, sentance structure, and build up- is no Twlight(no weird stalking, breaking and entering, or Emo Trash suicide loves). I had a hard time with the \\"Avon Book club\\" commercial vampire as I was editor for a newspaper and am a professional writer so cant stand bad writing even if the idea is good; The Hunger Games are very serious and crafted well. I loved the movie \\"The Running Man\\" with Arnold Swaz. \\"Conan\\" and Richard Dawson from \\"Family Feud\\" and it was basically a game show where contestants played for their lives....<br />and this isnt too much from that.<br />Highly recommended, even for the 30+ women!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the game!  Passes the time very well.  Easy to learn and play, my son and i fight over who gets to play all the time.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|What a great game for everyone. Its so hard not to be addicted . My five year old even loves it!!  The only problemis there's not more games like this. If there was I'd be one of the first on to download it. Please nordcurrent make more, you cant leave us hanging like this. Like the title says Wow.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I didn't think they could pull of a good album without John Bush. Especially considering the craziness that happened over the last couple of years with vocalists. This is a great album though, my favorite with Joey on vocals.
B002BWP49M|5.0|This came within 2 days of ordering it. I can't really comment on the movie itself, because it's a chick flick I got for my wife. I had to order a couple of things and thought she would like something too. Happy wife, happy life!
B003EYVXV4|5.0|Alright, yeah, I'm a guy and I read the book...And I loved the movie. The casting was perfect, the capitol was spot on, and for a PG-13 movie it was still pretty faithful violence wise. It was also faithful to the book in general! Now, whenever I go onto Youtube there's some that hated the movie. Yet they can't even give a reason. All they can say is \\"It's s***.\\" even if asked why they think that. Anyway, I don't want this to turn into a rant.<br /><br />I thought Jennifer was great. Hell, the whole cast...I found them to be the perfect cast as I have already stated. Willow (Girl who played Prim) was good, especially while saying goodbye to Katniss. Liam was good as Gale, but he could've used some extra lines. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch kept me laughing. Alexander Ludwig..Wow, he was great as Cato. Especially during the climax near the end. The Game were rushed at some points as Rue only got maybe ten minutes of screen time, but hey, there was a time limit. I didn't really care for the shaky camera, but it was more so used to keep it at a PG-13 rating. Josh when he was Peeta was supposed to be half-dead, but he seemed more slightly injured. Oh well, I got past it. On a scale of 1-5? 5/5. Scale of 1-10? I'm torn between an 8.5 or a 9.<br /><br />And to those who say that they didn't understand it- Where were you during the text at the beginning of the film? It explained the games.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch, may possibly see it one or two more times in theaters, and then I'll buy it on Blu-Ray.
1612130283|1.0|Horrible book. It was not believeable for one second. How would a 21 year old virgin have an orgasm the very first time she had sex. Thte whole thing was too easy. I hated Ana first off, shes a whiny little girl who says \\"oh.\\" too much and describes him touching her lip wayy to often. Also, by about the millionth time i was sick of him saying stop biting your lip. The whole thing was disgusting, him saying \\"oh ya baby\\" and \\"right there baby\\" reminded me of a cheesy porno rathwr than a developing love story. There are also many inconsistencies with the narrative, for instance, she describes how he looked after working out one morning then later in the novel she ponders whether or not he works out. Come on! I also find it hard to believe that a west cost college student of 21 is a virgin. I would have also liked more descriptors of Ana, i cant even picture her. Do not waste your money...
145162445X|3.0|An interesting book overall, worth the buy to those unfimiliar with comic inflation. Although I learned some new interesting things from this text, i found it to be bogged down with a lot of one-sided debate against creationism. I myself am an atheist and don't need convincing, and I imagine those who are theists would rather not have their viewpoints challenged so redundantly. I purchased this book mainly to be introduced to topics such as cosmic inflation and dark energy. The book did do a good job of explaining these things, but some of it may have gotten lost in the constant, unnecessary debunking of theist viewpoints through the chapters.<br /><br />6.5/10

B007FH9GT2|3.0|The film is fine although I prefer the original Swedish version, agreeing with previous reviews.  The music however is overbearing, dumps over dialogue in several scenes, and is simply overdone.  While I like Reznor's work, this is simply too loud and brash, diminishing what could have been 4 stars instead of 3
B006OFN0SE|4.0|A young J. Edgar (Leonardo Dicaprio) works in the Department of Justice.  He is an intelligent young man who excels at organizing data and seeing into what needs to be done to gather data to track radicals, communists and criminals.  Law enforcement at that time was archaic at best and databases on people did not exist or if they did they were only on a local basis.<br /><br />One evening the Attorney General of the US, several Senators, Federal Judges and prominent politicians' homes were bombed in 8 different locations at the same time.  J. Edgar is at the scene of his boss's home bombing shortly after it occurs collecting evidence. It leads to the arrest of communist radicals trying to subvert the American government.<br /><br />J. Edgar worked on a project to organize the library in Washington DC and he wanted to create the same type of data gathering and logging as he had helped use to set up the library.  He was among the first to push for fingerprinting and tracking of radicals and criminals.  The federal law enforcement agency at that time was weak and considered a joke.  They were not allowed to issue warrants, carry guns, arrest anyone or deport anyone.  At a very young age J. Edgar was appointed to be the head of the Bureau of Investigations and he basically set up the FBI and its investigative arms.  He believed in scientific investigative data and set up the famous FBI labs.<br /><br />He got what he wanted partially because he has gathered data files on presidents, congressmen, politicians and famous people.  He uses the dirt he has gathered to coerce those people to pass laws or to finance whatever he deems is necessary to move the FBI to his agenda...<br /><br />This is a very good storyline and follows some of the facts of history fairly well.  It is a tale of a driven paranoid man who trusts no one.  Most successful people are paranoid and he is no different.  He has his private secrets that finally begin to come out but everyone in power is terrified of his secret files.  I found it difficult to understand how the issues of J. Edgar's possible homosexual behavior became such a major part of this film. Unproven allegations seem to fit into Hollywood's eagerness to include such items into this film.  They wouldn't have had the courage to do this movie when he was alive!<br /><br />This movie is well acted by the entire cast.  I do think that one thing that hurt this movie's rating is that all of the actors are young and they wind up portraying the actual characters even up into their old age.  The old age special makeup is a bit overdone and you can't hardly help yourself but think that this is really a 30 year old person playing someone in their 60s and 70s.<br /><br />Despite that fact my wife and I enjoyed the movie and the acting.  The storyline is good but a bit dark in nature as J. Edgar was a cynical and paranoid man but that is part of what made him ideal for this job in America's troubled times.  He helped to make the FBI the leading criminal investigative organization in the world and helped to resolve some of major issues in those troubled times.ied of his secret files.

B004AUGJS8|4.0|Completely surprised at how good this movie was! We couldn't find anything to watch and I'm a fan of Ryan Gosling so we rented this one. I'd recommend it for sure.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This second book of the Hunger Games trilogy continues where book 1 leaves off and sets the stage for the final book. It is the all-important \\"middle child\\" of the trilogy, linking the story from start to finish. A very enjoyable read.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This monitor arm is very sleek and attractive.  Its up and down adjustment is a bit limited but is ok for my setting in a financial industry but may not be for a work space other than a desk setting.  Its side to side movement is very easy and can be loosened or tightened as needed.  There are friction adjusters at each joint on the entire arm that can adjusted as needed for your particular usage. It comes with an adapter for a second size mount on the back of the screen.  All in all a good choice, very good looking piece of equipment for a professional office environment.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final book of the Hunger Games trilogy has a lesson for all of us. In today's reality, countries are under the dictatorship of less than desireable leaders. This story reveals what can happen when a suppresed people decide they've had enough. A very strong female leader should encourage today's women to pursue their dreams.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I'm always afraid when I watch the movie adaptation of a book I loved that I'll be disappointed. Such was not the case with The Help. Wonderful movie whether you've read the book or not. Rent or buy it today!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|the free version does not do everything, but it does work well within its limits.<br />l would recommend this game to anyone who likes soliataire. thank you.
0553802534|5.0|This book was in GREAT condition as promised. I am a Lisa Gardner fan and in the process of collecting all her publications. This book is a MUST, thank for your excellent material!

1416550550|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was very well written, characters so well-rounded. I highly recommend it!<br />I love the author's writing style and her beautiful characters.<br />Not much else to say! haha wow. I loved it. :)
B002RSDW80|5.0|For those of you who love to cook, this is an amazing movie. Meryl Streep is magnificant! And I like Amy Adams in almost every she's done- there's just something about her... Nora Ephron, the director/writer, does a fabulous job of bringing two very different worlds together. I highly recommend this movie, but be warned- I'm always hungry somewhere in the middle, so have a yummy snack handy!<br /><br />Alexandra Pauley<br />[...]
B006Z9K97E|5.0|Many excellent books will no doubt be published this year.  None will be more disturbing.  None will be more unique.  There is no one on earth like Shin Dong-Hyuk.<br /><br />Shin was born in a North Korean labor camp in 1982.  His \\"crime,\\" as he learned many years later, was that two of his uncles defected from North Korea to South Korea (as tens of thousands of others did)--in 1951.  He is the only known person born in a North Korean labor camp to escape and defect.<br /><br />His treatment was horrifying--and routine. In camp he was starved and beaten all the time--as was every other prisoner.  His earliest memory is of an execution (everyone in the camp, including children, had to watch them). As a punishment when he broke a sewing machine, a guard cut off one of his fingers.<br /><br />No matter what I write, you cannot understand the brutality of Camp 14 unless you read this book.  Blaine Harden's cold, unsparing prose tells Shin's story in a way that anyone can read it, though no one will quite believe it (I knew Blaine for years while he worked at The Washington Post.  I don't believe I'm influenced in the least by my admiration for him in what I'm writing--the shock of the book is too great for that).<br /><br />There are no answers to the questions raised by Escape from Camp 14. The State Department estimates that 200,000 people live in such camps (you can see them on Google Earth), and most live out their short lives there since they are worked unsparingly and given little food and few clothes.  What should be done about it?  I don't know. But those who read this amazing book will know a few things about the North Korean regime that others cannot.
B001AMN8HE|5.0|I've seen all four of these Die Hard films, and while I loved the first and second one, and didn't really like the third, this fourth installment (and I'm really hoping they make more) is the BEST YET!!! I've seen it more than five times and I'm always, still, at the edge of my seat! Great work with the two leads- adding the younger guy really put a nice spin on generational issues and dealing with problems differently. This movie ROCKS!<br /><br />Alexandra Pauley<br />[...]
B005KP7EK4|5.0|Well...Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was, after all, something of a cliffhanger.  Here we find Butch, still alive, older and perhaps wiser, brilliantly portrayed by Sam Shepard in this very thoughtful film. But this movie is filled with enough action to satisfy the real Western lover.  It had me from the first scene.  I was reminded of Quigley Down Under, Lonesome Dove, and Open Range.  Great landscape cinematography, editing, and style make this poignant character study even more engrossing. I was happily surprised at Sam Shepard's rusty vocals on the old Americana tunes that are part of a superior musical soundtrack...who knew? The flashbacks to the old days fill in some gaps and provide that alternate ending we were all waiting for at the end of the original story of the quintessential Western dynamic duo.  Loved it!
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|I first caught a look at this story a few years ago when I chanced to watch the original Swedish feature.  It piqued my interest, so I took the opportunity to watch the two sequels and enjoyed them as well.  I will admit that I am a foreign film addict.  I enjoy listening to the language and don't mind subtitles at all, but mostly I enjoy them because they simply offer a fresher viewpoint than most of the crap that comes out of Hollywood. That being said, here are my thoughts on the American version:<br /><br />I thought the opening titles were the worst part of the film. It was too long, too loud, and had little relevance to the film. While I found Noomi Rapace somewhat psychotically endearing in the Swedish version, Rooney Mara came off as nasty to me, nothing to like about her at all. Lisbeth was more than just strange, she had feelings as well.  Craig brought none of the subtle humor found in the Nyqvist charachter that was present in the other version.  Though it followed the book more closely for the most part, the ending seemed like it was a hasty endeavor, as if everyone was bored with the project and wanted a quick wrap on it.  That to me is the fatal flaw in my view.<br /><br />A word about the rape scene that has repelled so many is in order.  Firstly, the real title of the story was \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" and that scene certainly reflects that.  Secondly, this story is part of a trilogy and that act by Lisbeth's guardian is central to all three parts of the whole story. Taking it out of the film would be like taking the concentration camps out of Schindler's List.<br /><br />So, unless you like the typical Hollywood technical dazzle, I would recommend the extended Swedish version (and while you are at it, watch all three parts) for the complete evolution of Lisbeth Salander.  You will be much more satisfied.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|it is fun at first.... then requires you to either.play simple minded games hundreds of times to earn enough points or pay for them with cash ...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hi this game is awesome! I love it hi ii hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game has no flaws for me! Add more elements and groups. I'm up to 203 elements! I don't understand why people are saying it force closes. It doesn't for my Kindle Fire. Oh, well!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|best product for keeping all of your info at your fingertips. syncs across all the platforms I work with at home and at work
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really like the game - hate popups esp. Spider Solitaire!!!! Also sometimes it is a little slow figuring out<br />what move you want to make -you have to &quot;show it&quot;.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I read this book \\"The pretty Little Liars\\" and it's so suspensful, mysterious and funny. It shows how people change in high school. I recomend this book for 13 and up even though I'm younger! Because most people in my grade don't understand it. But it is a drama/mystery. It has some pg-13 content in it. When i read this book, i laughed, and cried. I LOVE THIS BOOK
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This product was bought for a costume party, where I was a new Dr. It served me well, and I still put it up against doors before I open them :)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|who on earth would hate a game like this because think its more popular than temple run. In fact, on the ipod says it the words best game on there list so it better be your favorite game. Its the most popular game IN THE WORLD! SO YOU BETTER RATE IT 5,000,000,000 STARS!I'm done now what do I do. I know, play the angry birds space!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I have read this book in the hard cover many times and watched the series many times as well. Reading on my new kindly was simply a delicious experience again. I can almost quote dialogue but still am totally absorbed by the plot/s each time. The selection of language used throughout the book is superb and sometimes makes me think I wish we still spoke that way. Shame so much swearing and slang has entered our english language, that maybe high school students should read it to learn a new selection of words, or to have it reinforced that there are thousands of delicious words out there that far create more meaning than slang! A classic and always will be.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I'm almost speechless. So unbelievably good. It's like he went back and got some old jazz and made it better. It doesn't seem like something new, just better.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|While watching the film I thought Woody Allen made this movie for me personally.........I too want to be in Paris in the 1920's living with the Lost Generation......with this flick I feel like I am doing it.  I received this blu-ray a week ago and have watched this movie 7 times.  I could watch it evey day..but I know that is silly:) I have not even bothered to read many of the reviews on here....if people hate it....that is ok...Woody did not make the movie for them ....he made it for me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Saving a note on one device and accessing it from another device has been a true help. I dig how it captures picture files, too.
B0068MNNOE|4.0|Unless there is a smoking gun found sometime in the future, we will never really know for sure who wrote Shakespeare's plays and sonnets.  In a way that is OK; someone wrote them and they represent the greatest artistic achievement in the English language.<br /><br />This movie is a riff on one theory and carries it to a \\"logical\\" conclusion.  I thought it was fun to see the man we think of as the Bard as a vain mediocre actor channeling actors of today.  I enjoyed the recreations of some of the plays and found those scenes to be most enjoyable.  There is something about hearing that poetry that gets to me everytime.  I loved the look of movie and thought the blu-ray to be magnificent.<br /><br />I'll be watching often in the future.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|i liked it but it was to predictable.i mean really a girl(katniss) is protects her family,gets in a life or death sitution,fimds out one of her competitors is in love with her,saves him, whoo hoo
B0067QPVD2|3.0|Unfortunately, even with the CGI of today, it is not as well done as the Thing with Kurt Russel. The story was changed around, with the wolf being chased from a helicopter at the ending. It just lost a lot of the intense suspense. It was an okay movie and was okay to watch, it is just not as good.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's a simple story, well told by people who really love the Muppets. The music is fun to listen to (I must confess that I am a fan of Flight of the Conchords, so, maybe a bit biased). Not as special as the original, but, as the saying goes, you can't go home again.
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this app,it lets me put in preapproved apps for my kids so i can let them play with my phone or kindle.I don't have to worry about them ending up on the internet ordering things or worry about them clicking on ad supportedfree games as any app you put in the kids place it disables the ad from going any where and redirects the kidsback to where they should be .
B007MNV5WU|5.0|best app ever !I just got this and I already beat the first world .get it! awesomest app ever get it. wait didn't I already say that? whatever. just get it ok please for me! really
B0050DIWFC|5.0|After suffering to get through \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\", a pretentious ham-handed novel about murder in a high school, I was reluctant to read another book covering some of the same territory.  I'm glad I overcame that concern, because \\"Defending Jacob\\" is one of the best reads I've had in a long time.  Part murder mystery, part courtroom thriller, part nuanced family drama, it is a compelling book.  All the other reviews give you the plot basics, so I won't bore you with them.  If Scott Turow wrote a psychological thriller, this would be it.  I'm eagerly awaiting the author's next effort.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is an awsome app! i recommend to all. it is used quite often and i have told everyone i know.
B00003ZA27|5.0|While not the quintessential interpretation of the B minor Mass by J. S. Bach; it is nonetheless an intriguing offering by Von Karajan, who is well known for his interpretations of Beethoven.  This recording should be enjoyed without playing the game of comparisons to other masters.  Certainly Dr. Karl Richter is the foremost J. S. Bach interpreter, as I would suggest Karajan is the foremost of Beethoven.  The masterpiece itself is the pure art form, and it is a true masterpiece.  Among the many musical aspects of the work, the recurring two note motif woven throughout the work is the work of Divinely inspired genius.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After enjoying the Hunger Games, I found a lot of one star reviews that almost put me off the next two books to follow.  However, I found Catching Fire to be an excelllent read and the same with the third book in the series.<br />I think Hunger Games has such a strong fan base that some fans feel a sense of ownership and get testy when Katniss doesn't behave the way they expect and do the things they think she should.<br />Keep in miind, these books are not fairy tales and they should be judged on how well they were written.<br />I read all three and will see the movie when things quiet down.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|I bought this movie because Northanger Abbey is my favorite Austin book.  I was leery of purchasing because so much of the book happens in the mind of the main character.  I was afraid the plot and character development would not translate well to movie format.  It didn't.  If you have not read the book then the movie would be very confusing with little or no character motivation.  I gave my copy to the thrift shop.
B000002LR6|5.0|If only Ministry still made albums this good! Relapse is going back in the right direction but they have lost their unique sound, in favour of a more predictable heavy metal sound, with fewer industrial flourishes now.<br /><br />This album was named after a verse in Crowley's \\"Book of Lies\\" but Al (as opposed to AL) shows little sign that he understood any of the subtle humour of that text, just as his understanding of politics is embarrassingly shallow (who needs 3 albums telling us Bush was a liar and an idiot from someone who can't even see that Obama;s policies a re little different?). I suppose Leary must have introduced Al to AL.<br /><br />Still.. this \\"The Mind is  terrible Thing to Taste\\" and \\"The Dark Side of the Spoon\\" were about the height of industrial metal and somehow Al created am impressive sound, which he can't recapture himself even now.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! The poor writing and the contorted plot made it difficult to endure. We have an extensive dvd collection, and this was the first time ever that we threw a dvd in the garbage after viewing it. It was just too horrible to pass on to any other viewer!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots to choose from. great way to keep your self occupied.  easy to use and great for kids to keep busy as well
0385534639|5.0|I like this book. It reads very easy. I love the lay out of this book. It is very fun to read. I normally do not read books like this I prefer to read educational books. This book was a breath of fresh air. I recommend this book to any one. I have highly enjoyed this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's the perfect balance of everything. It goes from happy to sad in moments. It is great for anyone looking for a good book. Katniss and Peeta sound to be the cutess unexpected couple. From health, hardships, and worry they are all perfect just like the book. If it were me being Katniss I wouldn't mind living in district twelve. Peeta is so hot, too. Can't wait to see the movies.

0060899220|5.0|Well what can you say...  as an Anthony Bourdain fan, this is a fantastic book, but where to you rate quality of the actual \\"softcover version.\\"  If I knew I was buying a book that was essentially bound newspaper quality, I would have searched for a good condition used version.  The quality of the words are great, but forget the paper...  not very good at all.  Suggest you find another version that the \\"Updated Edition\\" in paperback or just go kindle.

We have experienced mild constipation but have easily remedied this by eating nonfat Activia and drinking more water.  I do not agree with the reviews that claim this is just another low-carb diet.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|As many other people I don't like that fact that it costs 2.99 but that's barely pocket change so I'm not upset. I like the idea of the space setting and how how they make use the force of gravity. I guess the reason there are only 2 worlds is because they could either wait another month and come out with 3 worlds or they could release it with 2, which I prefer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book would be great for both girl and boy. The love story is not too mushy for guys and the fighting is not too gruesome  for the girls. The author did a superb job in incorporating feelings that both genders can relate to. I recomend this book to any sane reader.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|This is a great movie if u watch it u will love it too its wayyyyyyyyyy better paranormal activity take my word for it its worth it
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|To put it simply, this film was one of the best movie-going experiences I've ever had. The opening sequence totally got my adrenaline pumping and the rest of the film was edge-of-your-seat suspenseful and didn't fail to keep my eyes glued for one second. I was surprised at how graphic the rape scene was, but it was the most real I think you could get with it. (DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS!) All in all, this was a definite win for me.<br /><br />The Swedish version I thought was boring and I hate reading subtitles. This version is 1,000 times better than the Swedish one, I don't care what anyone else says.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|u should buy awesome game it is better than the old game and ya awesome ya:D ya ya ya ya ya ya

B004P8JPS6|1.0|I have been a Reacher fan since a friend gave me 'Gone Tomorrow'.  This is the 16th I've read, and the most disappointing.  It seems that every 8th book in this series, Lee Child puts Reacher back in his Army days.  He does passable research for a novel with some Army flashbacks, but not nearly enough when the entire novel has Reacher in the Army.  The mistakes are frequent and distracting.<br /><br />Close to the opening of this novel, Mr. Child takes a crack at southern states, inferring that building military bases in the south is some kind of public works project.  Reacher would know that many bases are built in southern states to facilitate year-round training.  Mr. Child apparently does not.  After making the claim that the towns are dependent on the bases, he writes his fictional town so that apparently only the bars and one restaurant are dependent on the base.  **SPOILER**  During the base lockdown, he fails to deal with the 25-35% of base personnel who live in town and the ~50% of base employees who are civilians.<br /><br />Some of the mistakes are much more basic.  He goes out of his way to say that Munro and Reacher's black oak leaf rank insignia identify them as majors.  A black oak leaf rank insignia is for a Lt. Colonel.  A major's is brown.<br /><br />Devereux apparently quit the Marines after 16 years.  NO ONE DOES THAT!  She would be 4 years from a life long pension, PX and medical privileges, etc.<br /><br />The one star ranking is compared to the rest of the series, but if you want to remain a Reacher fan, skip this one!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I approached The Forever Girl with very little knowledge of what it was actually about, having seen only a small amount of information listed on it at the time. I soon found that the characters were exceptionally well written and had a depth that is hard to find in a lot of books, it was as though the characters were alive in the writing and you could relate to what was happening to them. One of the best things about the way the characters have been written, is that little or nothing is given away before the time Rebecca Hamilton wants you, the reader, to know something, so you actually feel like Sophia, you see things the way she is seeing them and each situation is pictured in the way you have read it.<br />The overall concept of the book is a very unique look at an old genre with a massive twist and that is something which I feel will appeal to a large number of readers because it is like reading a classic, but still like reading it for the first time.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book and can't wait for the next installment. The book gives the impression that a larger scale conflict is on the horizon, hopefully this will mean many more books from Rebecca Hamilton.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0985081821 The Forever Girl: Forever Girl Series, Volume One: Sophia's Journey (Volume 1)]]

0689878451|4.0|If you went to the ALA's most protested book website I referred to below, you will notice right away the number one fought book of this decade is this tale. The true story of the Central Park penguins Roy and Silo, who discovered each other and \\"fell in love.\\" Frustrated that they could not have an egg like other couples they went through the motions of nursing rocks. One day the zoo keeper gave them an extra egg and they took care of it until little Tango was born. Since then they have raised Tango up to be an adult.<br /><br />Of course the fear is if your child sees this true tale of a gay couple raising a baby successfully they will catch the gay. As if being gay was a choice. How many of you remember sitting down as a youth and weighing up your choice to become a heterosexual? It is all overblown paranoia.<br /><br />Weakness of the book - It s assumed they are a gay couple. Maybe they are having sexual relations, but the book obviously does not get into that. Otherwise it is a straightforward story about two penguins trying to have a baby and then succeeding. Very tame.<br /><br />Overall, I can only see this being threatening to people who have very incorrect notions of human sexuality. The fact it is a true story and told as tamely as possible should outweigh those concerns, but people are idiots.

0062068423|5.0|Why I read It<br />I really enjoy Swedish and Icelandic fiction so I testing the waters of other Scandinavian countries, Norway in this case.<br /><br />What I Thought About It<br />I am always apprehensive when I start a new (to me) author and the book is fairly large. I guess I am afraid of commitment, because life is too short to waste time on books I don't like. This is why you will rarely see me be really negative about a book; I will quit reading it if it doesn't grab me by page 50. This book delivered though. Strong mystery and it was tied into history which is always an added bonus for me. I never knew about Norway's involvement with the Nazi's on the Russian front. Even with that the mystery boils down to a crime of resentment and jealousy, and the solution is obtained with solid police work. Real crime with authentic investigation, perfect.<br /><br />Funny because I am immature, the lead character is named Harry Hole. It probably has different connotations in the original Norwegian.

B005WGBQ9G|5.0|One thing that really struck me in this episode is how believable the setting.<br /><br />The characters get dirty, go through more trials, and get even dirtier. I love that. So many shows keep their supposedly traumatized characters clean. They become exhausted from heat- I spent a good amount of time in that area and it is HOT. The characters are constantly affected by their environment. This is one way in which the series has so far been Uniquely Awesome.<br /><br />The other amazing thing- they kept the SUNSET completely consistent!! WOW!!! So much of the action is happening in parallel, and keeping the shots in a consistent light- I'm impressed.<br /><br />Also the last scene, between Carl and the deer- was amazing. Shane lifted his gun but Carl, still young enough to remind us of our humanity, wanted only to wonder at the deer. And he wondered at it while the men who had thought to kill it became entranced by it and by the boy's experience of nature. It was gorgeous.<br /><br />Restoration and Denial of humanity is central to the comic, and I am so pleased to see it so eloquently played out here- and also in the episode where the Grandmother restores humanity to everyone and is the hero.<br /><br />LOVE it!!
B0029LHX1W|4.0|Why I read It<br />I saw it on a lot of \\"Best of\\" lists and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />What I Thought About It<br />While the mystery was quite good (and it is the second book I have read this year with the same theme - cannibal serial killer), I actually enjoyed the historical aspect of the book more. It is set in newly communist Russia shortly after WWII and how the secret police treated crime and its citizens. For example, you couldn't say you had a murderer, let alone a serial killer on the loose because such things did not happen in a perfect society comrade. To do so, even as a cop figuratively standing on a stack of bodies, would be a crime against the state and earn you a trip to the gulag. I spent a lot of time contemplating societies (and by default organizations) that enforce a strict compliance to a set of arbitrary rules, and how that ultimately leads to abuse of power and self destruction. A lot to read into our modern society there, from terrorists to religion to families; good stuff.

B0051BNRTO|4.0|Why I read ItLove Nick Hornby and have read all of his books.<br /><br />The Good<br />It seems he is hitting a lot of his favorite topics - music and relationships. A fun story providing an inside look at a retired reclusive rock star and his obsessive and not so obsessive fans.<br /><br />The Bad<br />What happens?? Hornby uses the open nonending so you are not quite sure what happens. I know what I want so I for me that is the ending I have imagined.<br /><br />The Ugly (my opinion)<br />Another fun read from the master of romantic comedies for men. Well, he writes them from the man's perspective which in itself is very unique. Great book for all you Hornby fans out there.
B003Z0FS9U|4.0|Here we are again... the Saturday morning ritual... the mood setting music: 1978's soundtrack from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and where SABBATH did not snatch my entire body back in... oh, '75, or '76, they certainly snatched my ears, and mind. I have to thank a classmate for bringing in the PARANOID album. Ed? I hope you're still playing bass! We had a great teacher who, if we had been good and worked hard, would allow music to be played in the final 15 minutes of class. One day it was LED ZEPPELIN, but then one day, what's this? One of the most compellingly eldritch riffs I've ever heard... lots of phase shifting... or maybe a flanger (or maybe both)... an ominous vocal delivery warning us of the &quot;fallout&quot; from nuclear war. I've read that BLACK SABBATH's music either alienated you from the beginning or pulled you right in... again, thanks... ELECTRIC FUNERAL &quot;snatched&quot; me and hurled me into the heart of their brilliant musical axis.<br /><br />I was once told that BLACK SABBATH is THE most important rock group. Consider this: they were, perhaps the first to hit us with that enormously heavy wall of sound (sure it was in the wake of HENDRIX, CREAM [who Ozzy even reports was a big influence on him], THE KINKS, and THE WHO, but they didn't do it quite like SABBATH). Hard rock up to the present still presents with that loud, heavy wall of sound, and I'll be hard pressed to meet a &quot;hard rocker&quot; who doesn't owe some sort of debt to these squires from Brimingham.<br /><br />The original line-up's work is represented very nicley here spanning their eponymous debut through the anticipated release of '75's SABATOGE. From one show you get three great diplomats from SABATOGE: MEGALOMANIA, HOLE IN THE SKY, and, perhaps my favorite SABBATH tune, SYMPTOM OF THE UNIVERSE (no doubt, one of their best lyrical endeavors). Returning to their humble, precocious beginnings you're treated to NIB, BEHIND THE WALL OF SLEEP (such an overlooked SABBATH classic), and, of course, their title track, BLACK SABBATH. PARANOID's best elements are featured, as well: FAIRIES WEAR BOOTS, WAR PIGS (is this the definitive hard rock song of all time?), IRON MAN (another hard rock staple), and the title track, which some call their signature song. More great material follows: CHILDREN OF THE GRAVE, TOMORROW's DREAM, a snippet of SUPERNAUT (one of VOL. IV's highlights), and, what a surprise, the atypical CORNUCOPIA (which Bill Ward reports was one of his most difficult tracks to master, due to the odd time signatures [in one account he reports that he almost got fired over this!]). KILLING YOURSELF TO LIVE (from what critics have called SABBATH's finest hour, SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH) shines through, as well. Initial gripe: too bad more material couldn't have been featured from their stellar, mature, and smart 5th release, especially the title track, which is one of their indispensable songs (nice, though, that they included it on the REUNION live CD). Gripe number two: where's WHEELS OF CONFUSION? Furthermore, did they ever perform this live? I don't know... still, one of their best songs, and Ozzy's vocal performance is brilliant, as is the entire ensemble on this tune.<br /><br />Time to musically &quot;intellectualize&quot;... of the two shows you get the latter is probably clearer, and engineered a bit better; however, the former, pretty much a re-release of LIVE AT LAST, has been cleaned up, re-mastered, and expanded (originally I read that the band weren't happy about LIVE AT LAST being released back in the day, so hopefully this re-release &quot;makes good&quot; on the disappointment). It's also nice to get an honest live release from the original line-up. If you recall LIVE EVIL and SPEAK OF THE DEVIL (both virtuous releases, and highly recommended) were, more or less, released in competition during the &quot;Ozzy&quot; departure, and the &quot;Dio&quot; years. Which brings me to the line-up here. Although I've adored ALL ofSABBATH's work (I even got to see, perhaps the most unusual line-up with Ian Gillan singing, and Bev Bevan on drums), from Ozzy to Dio to Gillan to Martin (with the odd reunion thrown in) the original is still the definitive line-up. Anthony (your SG always sounds great, and I'm quite jealous of the sound you achieve), Terrence (great stage presence, and technical skill), William (perhaps the only hard rock drummer who swings), and John (words fail me... you're an iconoclast) formed a unique, resonant musical alchemy with their heavy metal &quot;wall of sound&quot; through power and volume, grandiloquence, great songwriting and musicianship complemented with &quot;Ozzy's&quot; vocal dynamics (angry, serious [again, a nod to ELECTRIC FUNERAL, as well as IRON MAN], grave, scary [for the longest time the song BLACK SABBATH scared the H-E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS out of me] sad and melodic [tell me his vocal delivery on CHANGES doesn't move you]). If you'd rather start with some of their studio releases, check out PARANOID, their debut release (self-titled), VOLUME IV, and SABATOGE. I'd even recommend HEAVEN AND HELL (Dio's introduction to the SABBATH galaxy was stunning).<br /><br />A bit of a traumatic memory just surfaced... I was all set to see SABBATH on the NEVER SAY DIE tour in '78 with opening act (new to the scene), VAN HALEN (what a pairing!!!!!, and as I've been told, one great show); however, I got a bad grade in math (ironic since it was in math class that my classmate introduced me to BLACK SABBATH!!!!!!! &quot;Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years!!!&quot;)... anyway, I learned my &quot;lesson&quot; and never got another bad grade in math... further, I was thrilled to see the BORN AGAIN tour in '83 with unknown future stars RATT opening up!<br /><br />It's amusing to think that a local British blues band called EARTH (such a peaceful, friendly, and &quot;down to Earth&quot; name) inadvertently &quot;invented&quot; heavy metal because they couldn't hear themselves over the din of a pub crowd, forcing them to turn their amps up to &quot;distortion&quot; level (if only it could've gone to 11!!!!!!!!!...

0671027344|4.0|This is the book that started it all up in Wisconsin, which has led me to my current project of reading banned books. Published in 1999 it has been on the ALA's top ten protested books every year since. So I figured it had to be pretty good given that track record.<br /><br />The book consists of a series of letters written by 15 year old Charlie; a quiet, introspective, bookish boy who finds more pleasure observing life than participating in it. The letters detail his freshman year of high school, discussing his friends and their lives. Ultimately through a series of events that bring him out of his shell he is finally able to confront his past and the tragedy he has repressed. It is a book about being lost, the role of friendship, and the redemptive power of being found.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in those issues. It is a messy book in the sense the life he presents is not pretty, but honestly life can be really messy sometimes. As for my kids I would say 16 is a good age to understand the underlying message of the book.<br /><br />Why is it a banned book? This one is easy; now remember that all of the following involves teenagers. So when I say abuse I mean teenage abuse, etc. The book contains in no particular order: Suicide, Drug Use, Rape, Homosexual Sex, Pedophilia, Child Abuse, Sexual Abuse, Alcohol Use, Drunk Driving, Fighting, Partner Abuse (i.e. hitting girlfriend), and a mention of bestiality. Now that looks like a really long list but most of these things are only mentioned in passing (like the last one involved one line wherein one character says to another, you remember that one kid who got drunk at a party and tried to get it on with the dog). The book is quite powerful and nothing is mentioned just for shock value; everything seems quite pertinent to the plot.

B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|Steven Soderbergh's HAYWIRE is the perfect argument against Hollywood's long-standing tradition of \\"waif-fu,\\" wherein the studio tries to convince us that a tiny, hundred-pound heroine manages to cut down baddies three-times her size (and weight) without flinching. (Bonus points if said heroine holds two Uzis akimbo and isn't knocked back on her butt.) Soderbergh's foray into action-schlock ditches that paradigm altogether by hiring an actual bruiser (MMA fighter and former AMERICAN GLADIATOR Gina Carano) to do all the rough-and-tumble work.<br /><br />Carano's Mallory Kane, a mercenary with a private firm hired by the U.S. government to rescue a Chinese journalist (Anthony Brandon Wong) from Barcelona, is less of a \\"honeypot\\" and more of a bulldog. Packing 145-pounds of muscle and a steely demeanor, Carano gut-punches, sleeper holds, and kicks her enemies without breaking a sweat. There's a story in HAYWIRE (penned by THE LIMEY's Lem Dobbs), with Kane determined to find anwers after being double-crossed by her boss (Ewan McGregor), but it's only there to guide us through setpiece after setpiece of Carano busting balls and taking names. Soderbergh films with a careful (and semi-distant) eye; Carano's athleticism isn't lost to the kinetic cameras that plague most action films in the post-Bourne world. Stripped of choreography and background music, the fights in Haywire astound.<br /><br />Like THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE, Soderbergh takes a relative non-actor and builds a world that plays to their strengths. Surrounded by heavyweights like Michael Fassbender and Michael Douglas, Carano may look out of place when she's trading words rather than trading blows. Yet, she holds her own thanks to her indomitable screen presence, having more enthusiasm than similar fighters-turned-actors of yesteryear (e.g. Jean Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris).<br /><br />If CONTAGION was Soderbergh making an Irwin Allen film, then Haywire is him making a mid-eighties martial arts film. I don't know what possesses Soderbergh to try more off-beat experiments than other directors, but I admire his technique. Haywire isn't an arthouse deconstruction of an action film; it's an action film, period.
B000002N1E|5.0|WOW!! I can't stop listening to this cd!! I think hands down his best CD alongside Purple Rain and 1999. Anybody that likes Prince will LOVE this CD!!
0439023513|1.0|This book, to me, is the equivalent to the horribleness that is \\"Breaking Dawn\\" to the Twilight franchise. Heartwrenchingly terrible. Don't get me wrong, it was well written and you get sucked into the story, hoping your favorite characters stay alive. Most of them don't though. And the ones that do, are just an empty shell of a character after all the torture the war has put them through. I wish I never read this book. Peeta and Katniss I hold so close to my heart since I'm an uber-fan, and this book just shattered those characters. WTH! Why? Just read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire and leave it at that!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I wish it didn't cost money but it was worth it! its so funny and no one has ever done some thing like this ever ever ever!!!'
B005GUQIDC|5.0|I had already listened to every song on Youtube and was determined to actually purchase this CD. I love her sound and I love that the CD is full of not so obvious songs. What I mean is Cameo Lover, for instance, is a song about unrequited love.  But its not an obvious mooning over a man type song. Good Intent is about a cheater, but once again it isn't full of the cliches phrasing that one would expect. I love the lyrics and the thought put into these songs. I've listened to this CD several times now and haven't felt the need to skip over anything yet which is such a change.  The last CD I was able to do that with was my Nikka Costa CD [[ASIN:B000THIK2O Everybody Got Their Something]]. I'd definitely recommend this CD to anyone who is tired of what is currently on the radio and is desperate for something different. Her live music is so innovative (in my humble opinion) and it is a welcome distraction from the talentless, auto-tune, pop music drivel that is so pervasive in music now.

0316056863|3.0|I listened to this audiobook form, and I definitely think it's the way to go. There are certain little nuggets that Tina puts in the audio version, and I really dig listening to authors read their memoirs, anyway.<br /><br />While the book was engaging and had its moments, I was a little let down. The problem was, I wanted a real memoir, and this is really more of a collection of essays. It's interesting and entertaining, but it's not the life story and reflection I was hoping for. And, I probably should have realized this, since Tina's still IN her career, and those types of memoirs don't happen until the celebrity's fame has died down. She talked about key aspects that people want to know about: SNL, 30 Rock, impersonating Sarah Palin - but they were more anecdotal than reflective.<br /><br />She did mention at times about the sexism that she faced (and still faces) and how she paved the way for women in the industry, but it's only in brief moments. She spends more time talking about the modeling process, how she celebrates Christmas with the in-laws, and bad cruise ship experiences. But yet, she never talks about how she met her husband?<br /><br />I think people who dig Tina Fey because she's funny and don't care so much about her \\"roots\\" will enjoy this book more. It reads more like a stand-up routine than a memoir. I'll wait another 10 years for the more in-depth book.

1612130283|1.0|First things first, if you didn't already know, this story was originally a Twilight fanfiction story distributed for free. It's \\"slightly\\" reworked, meaning the character names are changed. But, if you're familiar with the Twilight characters, it should be pretty easy to spot who was supposed to be who. Since it's revised, the author gets to charge lots of money for her story, because now it's \\"real fiction\\" and has \\"no connection anymore to Twilight\\". So, is it worth your money? Heck no.<br /><br />Lazy author aside, this is just not a good story. There's certainly a lot of sex, especially of the \\"S&M\\" variety, so if that's what you're after, you won't be disappointed. However, if you want character development, a logical plot, or a well-paced story, you are out of luck. Hey, it's just like Twilight, minus the sex.<br /><br />The story focuses on virgin Bella Ana, who falls forEdward Christian, a millionaire with a dark past who also happens to like BDSM. And .. that's about it. Not much really happens in this story. Once Ana and Christian meet and learn about one another, the rest of the story is a struggle between Ana deciding if she can handle the BDSM lifestyle and be with Christian. She can. Sex. No, she can't. More sex. But she really cares about Christian. Sex. Now she's really mad at him. Has sex anyway..... You get the picture.<br /><br />The characters were a bit ridiculous at times. Ana seemed at first like she could be an independent, strong-willed female character who was NOT driven by her irrational lust for a boy. Oh wait, just kidding. She is supposed to be a virgin who never really had a serious boyfriend. All of the sudden she's having amazing sex and totally falling for Christian even though he stalks and controls her? This makes total sense. Just like Twilight ;)<br /><br />I honestly only read this book because it has become a best-seller, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was. Maybe it was a good story and I was missing out.... Naaaaa. Little actually happens in this book, and we don't even find out that much about the character's back-stories, especially Christian's. The first book ends in such an obvious way to get you to buy the next one. The problem is, there's not enough here to keep me reading. I sense it'll just be more Ana/Christian should we/shouldn't we drama with a couple more scraps of back-story thrown in for good measure. No thanks.
B004G6009U|3.0|While my kids do enjoy this movie, I was disappointed in it.  The plot was weak and unbelievable (even for a Disney movie).  The singing was good and fun, but it wasn't enough to redeem the movie for me.
1451627289|5.0|In 1971, King thought a great idea of a book about somebody goes back in time to stop Lee Oswald from killking JFK. Though the amount of research (and that meant going to a library for hours), King put the idea aside But in 2007, King gave a hint that he was doing this book after all. But still, he waned to finish his Dark Tower seris, so the idea is set aside yet again.<br /><br />But now, it's finally here...<br /><br />King explores what if YOU could change time? Jake is just a normal human being who's working as a teacher. He had a bad relationship. But it was the essay from Harry Dunning that changed his life. And Al, who owns a diner and friends with Jake, shows Jake a myserious \\"rabbit-hole\\" that Jake could go back in 1958. And it only just took two minutes off from your present time (the story is told in 2011).<br /><br />Due to Al's health, Jake must do what Al was planning to do: to stop Lee from killing JFK, and not only that, maybe stop the  Vietnam War as well.<br /><br />Now, I could not give the whole plot away, but the idea of having the past in your hands...or you think you do, really makes this story exciting. It's unprediticable. I could not stop reading this book. It has A LOT of other themes such as romance, time doesn't want to change, the past will come back, and changing the future either for the better or worst. I don't feel this book has \\"unnessary parts to make it longer.\\" All of these parts does have their own purposes...and yes, the story will slow down near the midle, but if you are a huge Stephen King fan and thinking about getting this book...GET IT!<br /><br />It was worth the time reading!

B005JE7WKI|5.0|My wife and I knew nothing about this movie when we rented it. We were pleasantly surprised at how funny this movie was. My favorite part is the chainsaw and bees. I'll say no more, don't want to ruin it but the ensuing scenes are priceless! Rent this, you'll enjoy it.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|last night i watched ALL of season 2 in one big viewing gulp.  if anything, season two is even more romance novel like and soap opera like than season one.  all the more reason for its being so compulsively watchable.<br /><br />this time world war one is in full swing and there is no one unaffected by it.  the women at the abbey become highly useful rather than ornamental with all of them becoming involved in the nursing or convalescence of soldiers. ironically, the one person who should be the most ornamental, maggie smith's dowager countess, is perhaps the shrewdest character in the lot. she can cut right through to the central issue in almost any problem. she even becomes quite adept at handling matthew's mother by discovering her achilles's heel, feeling she is useful and needed. my favorite scenes in the show are the dowager countess's battles with matthew's mother.<br /><br />there are two sets of star crossed lovers throughout.  these are lady mary and matthew upstairs and anna and bates downstairs.  just when you think either set will finally resolve all difficulties, some other huge wrench gets tossed into the story. of course, give those two sets of lovers a happy ever after episode and basically the show is over.<br /><br />as the characters struggle to recover from the war, they are hit by the even more fatal flu epidemic of that era, which killed more people than the war.<br /><br />is my appetie whetted for season three?  you bet.  bring it on!<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

1609611543|1.0|First the good news - I was able to return the book.<br /><br />If you're a history buff or a science geek you may enjoy reading the history of wheat from the beginning to time until today, but if you're interested in health save your money. This guy makes a lot of mostly unsubstantiated promises about the benefits of eliminating wheat from your diet....after slogging through 193 pages he finally says that eliminating wheat alone won't do it!! He then takes off on his modified Atkins Plan and says that what you must do is eat unlimited nuts, oils and meats.....Pleeeze, not again.<br /><br />This is a retread, save your money.

I was able to change the COM port with no problems and communicate to the ISDN box. Unfortunately, the ISDN box had an additional issue but the serial adapter worked just fine.
1594203334|5.0|I have read this book and I can say,the whole Europe is raising the kids the same way, not only in France. I was born and raised in Central Europe. I loved the book, but the whole story for me was common sense. Europeans don't eat fast food because we didn't have fast food in our country until 90's, plus Europeans enjoy good food. I live in US for 10 years and I don't eat fast food, only homemade and my daughter which is 2 and half, eats only homemade, natural, and whole foods. I am raising her in US, the same way I will be raising her in Europe just like is written in a book and it works. Many American parents think, I am very lucky because she is so easy going and independent and very content and happy kid. But I think, following the advice written in this book, really works on kids. I am mom, working full-time (35 hours), and pre-med  student, and I cook everyday homemade meals, despite the fact I am busy. It is doable. I have American stay at home moms friends and they look exhausted from helicoptering parenting. I give my girl lots of freedom, but we have some rules, like sitting quiet at the restaurant, eating everything, having few toys at home, and playing without me. In addition, I don't have nanny, she only goes to preschool 3 times a week, and then she stays with me or my hubby. Read the book follow the advice from little baby, it is easy. Just have some rules and the rest - be relaxed \\" French,European mom.\\"

B000ELJBAK|4.0|In 1978 David Gilmour was still the lead guitarist and (best) vocalist in Pink Floyd. This was the year between Animals and The Wall and Gilmour took the opportunity to record an album of material that was closer to his musical soul than the introspective and darker songs written by Roger Waters as he eventually took over Pink Floyd. Gilmour's guitar solos have always captivated Floyd fans (Comfortably Numb, Time, Money, Dogs...) and as you immagine, there is a heavy dose on this debut album. Gilmour has a recognizable voice from the more melodic Floyd songs (Time, Us and Them, Wish You Were Here, Goodbye Blue Sky...) but it's his distinctive guitar work that is the attraction here. Soaring one moment and bluesy the next; it's always immediately recognizable as David Gilmour. The song writing is better than say \\"On an Island\\" which was his most recent release. The Pink Floyd-ish sound apparent on much of this record is more a testiment to his influence on the band's sound more than his attempt to just copy Pink Floyd. It becomes obvious listening to this music that had Roger Waters allowed the band to bring all of the member's creative talents together; Pink Floyd would have continued to make great music for years to come. Gilmour's (and Richard Wright's) influence was reduced on each record after Dark Side.<br />There are nine songs on this 2006 re-master. Highlights include \\"Mihalis\\", \\"There's No Way Out of Here\\", \\"Short and Sweet\\" and \\"Raise My Rent\\". Least favorite moment is \\"Deafinitely\\" which is a Jeff Beck style jazz-rock fusion piece which mises the mark a bit. If you are a Pink Floyd fan, there is no way you won't like this record. It's better than any post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd record and yet not as good as their 70's hay-day period. But, it's still really good.

B003EYVXV4|4.0|There's no rallying moment more galvanizing for any soul than when kids are placed in jeopardy, and the ultimate extension of this is writer Suzanne Collins' THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy and the massive popularity it's garnered. I was mesmerized by THE HUNGER GAMES, enthused by CATCHING FIRE, and I'd rather not talk too much about MOCKINGJAY. I went to the movie theater yesterday, hoping for the best, preparing for a let down. When you are into a book this much, it pays to be cautiously optimistic when the film adaptation is in play. I was either gonna eat the popcorn or throw it at the silver screen. I ate the popcorn.<br /><br />The broad strokes of the premise: In a futuristic, dystopian world, in a North America that no longer exists, there are the twelve districts and the Capitol City that rules them. Some time ago, the twelve districts had rebelled and were harshly put down. As punishment and as a standing warning, the Capitol each year forces each district to select, by lottery, a pair of its youths (called \\"tributes\\") to compete in elaborately staged arenas. The objective is to kill each other until only one child remains. The Hunger Games is broadcast not only to the Capitol but to all twelve districts of which oppressed citizens are forced to watch as their terrorized children are inhumanely butchered one by one.<br /><br />District 12, a coal-mining community, is one of the most impoverished in the nation. One can't blame 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen for sneaking off into the woods with her bow and arrows to hunt game to feed her family. We learn right away that she has a knack for uncanny straight shooting. Not too much later, the dreaded lottery arrives. It soon finds Katniss desperately volunteering to replace her younger sister, Primrose, whose name had just been called. Katniss's aptitude for archery won't nearly be enough to guarantee survival. The underdog contestant requires charm and the gift of gab and the ability to generate sponsors to support him or her during the Game. Katniss, who scowls a lot and is standoffish, isn't exactly an extrovert. But the baker's son, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the boy selected from her same district, knows how to work the crowd. No wonder that Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a functional drunk and the assigned mentor to the District 12 contestants, demonstrates a higher regard for Peeta. \\"May the odds be ever in your favor,\\" recite the decadents of the Capitol. Except that you have to finesse those odds.<br /><br />The book presented many emotional beats, but there were two that seared themselves on my mind. One, of course, depicts the utterly gutwrenching moment in which Prim gets picked in the lottery and Katniss's prompt reaction. The film captures that perfectly. I particularly liked the scene in which Prim, heeding her older sister's advice, tucks in the back of her dress as she hesitantly goes to her own slaughter. It's a heartbreaking touch.<br /><br />The other truly memorable moment in the book concerns Rue of District 11, the smallest and youngest female participant, and what happens to her and how Rue's district then responds to Katniss. The film glosses over that bit, and, in fact, stinges on its moments with Rue.<br /><br />I liked the movie. I would've liked it better had I not read the book. The film's PG-13 rating will draw in more of the kids but it doesn't alter the fact that the rating results in a more sanitized product, a toning down of the violence, a tamping down of the impact presented by the horrific elements within this dystopian fable. The ugly bits have been suppressed some. Still, what we do see on screen is some messed-up dehumanizing stuff. It's definitely immersive and thought-provoking. And it's anchored by a tough and powerful performance by Jennifer Lawrence. Meanwhile, I thought rocker Lenny Kravitz inhabits his role of Cinna, wardrobe stylist extraordinare, more naturally and convincingly than did Harrelson as Haymitch. Stanley Tucci is again terrific as a smarmy show host type.<br /><br />As a manly man, I was never that keen on the trilogy's romantic triangle, although I was always aware of Katniss being torn between her childhood friend Gale and Peeta. The reader never really knew for sure whom she was setting her cap on until much, much later. In THE HUNGER GAMES, the book, Katniss was more ambivalent about her feelings for Peeta. In the film, she seems to genuinely return his romantic interest. But, again, maybe it's a false front she was presenting in the film, and I just missed the subtle cues. It's what happens when we're not privy to the characters' inner monologues. The actors who played Gale and Peeta? They were okay. I thought Hutcherson was a bit overwrought.<br /><br />Here's the difference between the film and the book: I recommend the film; I insist you read the book. There are many good things about the film. The acting is strong (again, Jennifer Lawrence is amazing). And while it runs over two hours, the pace doesn't lag. The rich narrative grips you and horrifies you and it provokes thought and conversation. You may even well up. The ending is open-ended (we know there'll be more chapters to this story). The girl on fire, Katniss Everdeen - often ill-at-ease and enflamed by injustice and who often rashly follows the dictates of her heart - is a better role model for girls than any Kardashian.ucci is again terrific as a smarmy show host type.<br /><br />As a manly man, I was never that keen on the trilogy's romantic triangle, although I was always aware of Katniss being torn between her childhood friend Gale and Peeta.

B005FISC52|5.0|This show is definitely  one of the best teen shows. No doubt the first four seasons are the best and classic OTH. Seasons 5 and 6 were good too, but then when Lucas and Peyton left the show went into a downward spiral, then picked back up in season 8 and 9. I don't like all the cast changes, the only good cast addition was Austin Nichols(Julian <3). The others were just awful, I'm certainly not a Clay or Alex fan at all!!! I will miss this show greatly but love that I can watch the seasons in the comfort of my own home. Season 9 is  more interesting, wish Luke and Peyton would come back more often thought.(Can't believe Peyton didn't come back for Brooke's wedding!!!!) Nathan and Haley were on my March Madness brackets for best tv couples, NALEY FOREVER!!!!. There is and will only be One Tree Hill.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I love the series, the Blu-Ray has awesome image and audio quality, and great on-screen extras. But there is a known issue with this set of discs on the Sony BDP-S580 player. The discs either take forever to load, or they lock up completely, requiring you to reset the player. I've found that the best solution is to hold the power button down until the player shuts off, then turn it back on. I read on one discussion board that Sony is working on a firmware update, but that could be a while.  Meanwhile, I'm enjoying watching the show, once I get the discs to load.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Always one of my favorite guitarists, Mike Campbell has proven himself, during the span of close to forty years, the quintessential foil to all that Tom Petty does.  He plays with a wonderful restraint, always putting the song first.  This, naturally, makes perfect sense since we're talking about Tom Petty, one of his (or any) generation's greatest songwriters.  Campbell's playing on early Petty--think of the first six or seven albums--was always minimalist and spare, yet just as graceful and powerful.  It was all about brevity and taste: Listen to \\"Breakdown\\" and \\"Refugee\\" and \\"Listen to Her Heart.\\"<br /><br />Then, in the late 1980's, when Petty's sound changed a bit (attributed, most likely to his fruitful partnership with ELO's Jeff Lynne), Campbell's playing seemed to take a more prominent role in each song.  His solos, though never particularly long, became more commonplace, slide was employed generously, and in concert, he seemed to really enjoy stretching out a bit.<br /><br />There was always the indication that here was a guitarist who could play with the best of them, but was saving it all up for when it was absolutely necessary.  It seems that Mojo signifies that time.  This is one of the most guitar-oriented albums I can recall in the last ten or so years.  And nothing is lost in translation.  Meaning that songs (all fifteen!!) are still wonderful.  From the opening blues rant of \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\" to the incendiary \\"First Flash of Freedom\\" to the gorgeous \\"The Trip To Pirate's Cove,\\" each tune is a study in tone, lyricism, and taste.  Other highlights include the poignant \\"Something Good Coming,\\" \\"Lover's Touch,\\" and \\"Don't Pull Me Over.\\"<br /><br />I cannot recommend this album enough.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I came to this offering after having owned and viewed the Swedish extended trilogy version.  What remains to be seen is if Hollywood completes the trilogy.  So, that said, let me compare apples to apples:  this version is actually quite well done and not that different from the Swedish edition.  Daniel Craig was the biggest surprise to me.  Unlike his neanderthal performances in, say, \\"Elizabeth\\" and the James Bond outings, here Mr. Craig exudes a more contrained, muted and refined version of the Blomkvist character.  I actually believe this to be his finest performance to date.  As for Roony Mara, well, she nails Lisbeth with a bit less grunge than Ms. Rapace conjured up.  Still, quite exciting to watch.  Overall, this version is not as atmospheric as the Swedish verson, in my opinion.  I think owning both sets would be ok if one could afford it, and, again IF the Hollywood version does indeed become a \\"set.\\"  If I could only own one, it would be the Swedish version.  Thanks for listening.[[ASIN:B003Y5H5HO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]
B003QCCS36|5.0|I really want to send this album to certain artists of the 60s and 70s who used to make records like this.  And I want to include a note that says, \\"Listen.  Listen again.  Remember when?\\"<br /><br />Those artists, out of deference, will remain nameless, but think of those who used to make gorgeous, mostly mellow, lyrical music with substance and melody and grace and wit.  That's what God Willin' conjures up for me.  It is stunning in its clarity and focus.  It plays like a concept record of sorts, yet does not necessarily contain one common thread.<br /><br />The record abounds with acoustic guitar, pedal steel, and light percussion.  Highlights include \\"God Willin',\\" \\"Beg Steal or Borrow,\\" \\"Old Before Your Time,\\" and \\"For The Summer.\\"<br /><br />Some say LaMontagne is too serious, but there are hints of humor in the opening track, \\"Repo Man,\\" as well as in the last tune, \\"Devil's in the Jukebox.\\"  Lyrically and musically, this album is remarkable and refreshing and a definite nod to those nameless artists who used to write and record in a similar vein.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun and it has so much to do on it and it will never get old ever or ever or ever
B0012GMW34|5.0|I love this album.  It is spiritual and heady and it marks a collaboration of two true guitar virtuosos, both of very disparate styles.<br /><br />Inspired by the spiritual teachings of Sri Chinmoy as well as John Coltrane's A Love Supreme, Love Devotion Surrender truly is an enlightening listening experience.  The guitar battles occasionally overwhelm--but in a good way--and the mood always strikes a contemplative state of mind.<br /><br />There are only five songs, and each one delivers something unique and sublime.  The opening \\"A Love Supreme\\" is so dynamic and fluid that it is the perfect choice for a leadoff track.  And the lovely acoustic \\"Naima\\" is mellower yet just as powerful.  Every other song is just as good.<br /><br />A true career highlight for both Santana and McLaughlin.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|Yes! I may read this book WAAAYY before the movie was even mentioned, and it never occured to me that they should adapt this into a movie. Maybe because of the thought that every book-to-movie adaptation will end up as trash. But, in this movie, \\"The Hunger Games\\", Ross broke this trend. Filled with action, adventure, fight for survival, suspense, drama, and a little sprint of romance, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a fun movie for the whole family, older than thirteen.<br />To those of you who have no idea of what this movie is about:<br /><br />The future United States was divided into thirteen states, or here - districts, that are ruled by the powerful Capitol. Then, one day, District 13 rebelled against them, and the Capitol wiped out the entire district, kicking them off the map of Panem (United States). Now, to remind the remaining twelve districts, the Capitol invented The Hunger Games to remind each and everyone that the Capitol is powerful, and can do whatever they want. If a district rebels, they all die. Simple as that.<br />Now, the annual Hunger Games. Each of the twelve districts will give up one young man and woman between the ages of twelve and eighteen to be sent down to an arena where they will fight to the death and one wins - winning a life of glory, respect, and fortune, technically everything, that are provided by the Capitol.<br /><br />Now, of course, each book-to-movie has its own flaws, and this movie has some minor ones, and nothing too big that will ruin your experience. Some were too subtle to be even noticed, some were very big to some \\"Hunger Games\\" fans, called Tributes. Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar nominee, was THE perfect Katniss. Any one will be very proud on how she portrayed this brave fictional character. Yes! Some most-awaited scenes, like the chariot scene and the cave scenes, will be there, changed up a bit, but they will be there!<br /><br />Death Scenes:<br />I was looking forward to MANY of the death scenes in this movie, since I pictured them in my head very brutally and visciously. But, the movie kept it to the highest PG-13, so you can still enjoy it. Watch out for those scenes, like the Tracker Jackers and the Wolf Muttations.<br /><br />All-in-all, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is an instant classic! A milm and a soon-to-be-movie-series that Will Be Known Worldwide! So, Kristen Stewart might want to step out of the spotlight, because Jennifer Lawrence will be taking over.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire!
B000002G9S|5.0|This is one of those bands that should have been bigger.  Plain and simple.  They had the chops and the attitude and most importantly, they had the songs.  But I suppose when you compare them to their more flamboyant peers such as Humble Pie, Led Zeppelin, and The Who, they were too tame to make more of an indelible mark than their one hit (\\"All Right Now\\") afforded them.<br /><br />Fire and Water is one of those albums that rewards its patient listeners with the timeless gift that keeps on giving: I am, of course, talking about Paul Kossoff's beautifully understated guitar solos.  Every song--there are only seven--contains what seems like an absolutely memorable and meticulously crafted guitar solo.<br /><br />The lead off track, \\"Fire and Water\\" is a perfect example of this; its solo is a perfect study in gorgeous sustained notes, tasteful tone, and bluesy bursts of delicious Les Paul histrionics.  \\"Oh I Wept\\", \\"Remember\\", and \\"Heavy Load\\" are cut from a similar cloth.<br /><br />Yes, this is the album that contains \\"All Right Now.\\"  And that tune is wonderful.  And its guitar solo fits all of the aforementioned criteria.  But it's the other six songs, imbued with Paul Kossoff's extraordinary guitar playing, that make this album remarkable.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I really like track 2 \\"Pressure\\" it was on Sims 2 on the PS2 and it is catchy and gets stuck in your head. I have wanted the song for a long time. The first half of the CD is non-stop hits that you would not want to skip. The second half is still good and if they were on the radio, I wouldn't change the station. Thanks for making this CD Paramore.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I realize that most people, (including myself at first) were not prepared for a realistic ending to the trilogy. It slowly dawned on my at some point during Catching Fire that this was absolutely not a fairytale. These characters, they were tortured and forced to murder. You can't expect everything to go back to normal after. I understand that Prim had to die, I really do. There would've been no realization that Coin was more of a villain than Snow in the end, which is crucial to the story. I don't understand why Finnick had to die. I felt it was unnecessary and I found myself wondering who was going to comfort Annie after it was all over.<br /><br />I think the most unsettling thing about this all is that we literally watched the characters deteriorate and never be fully revived. And that's how it would be realistically. The nightmares and flashbacks would never stop, people are going to die and<br /><br />If you're expecting a complete fantasy revival and bounce back of the characters, I warn you that you won't receive it. The book is quite good but a little overwhelming to read at times.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|This  CD is just fast-paced awesome wow! Mixed with a bit of pretty kinda slow wonderfulness. The only track on the whole CD I skipped was #9 (\\"We are Broken\\") and that doesn't mean it's not good, just not my cup of tea. I love this CD and regret all the hours of listening enjoyment I would of had if I had purchased it sooner. Paramore please please please keep making music like this CD it is unique, priceless, and very enjoyable. On a side note the drumming on this CD was incredible, as well as the vocals obviously :).
B004ZISVWC|4.0|I was surprised at the quality of this Norwegian film.  It takes the guise of a documentary done by a group of college students that think they are filming a bear poacher.  I really liked the story and the special effects were extremely well done, in my opinion.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I'd been waiting a long time for Season 4 to be available on DVD, and there was several months wasted with some kind of delay.<br /><br />  When the chance to stream the entire season for $20 arose, I went for it like a hungry trout.  Not disappointed.  It's a blast to be in charge of a whole year's episodes, and I watched them all in about three sittings.  My son (the aristocrat) paid extra for the perfect-picture version, and he was happy also, but I can tell you that the picture quality of the cut-rate version was just fine.<br /><br />  Entirely satisfied.  Money well-spent.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|I personally preferred the original movie (Sweden) with subtitles, yet I saw this movie twice (once in the theater with one of the adult children and again on Amazon instant with my wife).  The problem with watching it on instant is one cannot hear the words - the producer/director has near continuous background music while there is dialogue. As you know instant has no subtitles.  Fortunately, we knew the movie from the original Sweden version and though we missed many words were able to follow the story. Had we not watched the original version, I doubt we would have given this movie a four star (more in the one or two star).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last of the trilogy who close the history a story who could become real if we continue to fight each other! Thanks
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game sure does pass the time and it's social too. Works great on my Kindle fire. You don't have to spend any money on this app if you don't want to, but you can purchase gems if you want. :) Have fun.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this as an extension hoping it would let me use my OtterBox case on my iphone with my iHeart Blood Pressure Monitor and my Sony Sound Dock.  It really works great.  I am gettig more so I can leave them on the docks as they also extend enough for my other iPhone to work with these in it's OtterBox.  Great Item.  Fast Delivery.  No problems.  I recommend this item.  It even has a USB plug on the side as well as the 30 pin pass through.<br /><br />Here is the link for the blood pressure monitor.  It records Blood pressure/Beats per minute/ and shows a graph of the heartbeat.  I'm taking it to my heart doctor to see week after next.
