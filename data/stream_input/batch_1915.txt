1591844096|5.0|I was given this book as a reading assignment for a class in college, and it has since changed my outlook on life. Great read for anyone who is looking to challenge the status quo and make a real difference in the world.
0071752854|5.0|Very informative and interesting to keep me reading every chance I could get. It really helped me outline my own pitch to give me confidence to present my product. High recommendation.
B009XY97VC|4.0|I found Two Steps From Hell on a whim and have fallen in love with just about all of their albums.  Like Archangel, Skyworld's sounds can help you imagine not only the song's intended focus but the world it exists within.  Music should let a soul AND mind soar.  Two Steps From Hell succeeds where others tread too lightly to be heard.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and fun puzzles make a good game. No glitches so far, engrossing story, hidden objects are not simple,but still doable. Some of the mini games are somewhat difficult but take a minute and watch the screen, and they can still be done without skipping any. I have been gaming for a long time, and this is as much fun as any I've paid for.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great, no problems with it so far. Works good with the Kindle, has large numbers and is very easy to see
B008OJ291W|5.0|Great Golden Oldies revamped !! Crystal clear versions of songs that I grew up with , and now my kids love them as well
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Just a very poorly written and directed movie. Absolutely stinker of a plot. Previews looked better. Stay away from this one.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This certainly will not be my last Jack Reacher book.  I'm hooked already and want to read them all now.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|The other levels are easy but how do I defeat Zarp?<br />I mean, he is very hard to defeat!<br />How can I beat Zarp?!
B004I8WD7S|2.0|Bought one clear and one black for myself and my husband.  they work OK but ruin my protect sheet on the phone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An adventurous story that keeps you imagining what will happen next! A very easy read that will have you comparing our current culture to Katniss` experiences.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Was wondering if the full version was more true to the game. MIght have to take that chance and purchase it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is lightweight and in expensive, we are very pleased with this product. If it had a built in screen protector I would have rated it 5 star.
B009MFHFP2|5.0|Absolutely beautiful . .I love this album . .very sweet . You can easily get lost in the words . in a good way!!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|We bought this after renting, then buying Super 8 on DVD, which got scratched because it wasn't put back in the case.  Then we got a BluRay player and decided this was a must buy!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds is one of my favorite crime dramas on T.V. They never seem to run-out of craziness. The show is fresh and this season seems to be leading up to a nail-biting event, since they are all being watched by an un-sub. I can't wait to see what happens. I just hope everyone makes it out alive.  If you like this show, season 8 does not disappoint.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|We enjoyed this movie. It's fun and cute and we laughed a lot. No, it won't win an Oscar but it was an entertaining watch.
098555780X|5.0|Simple, pictured illustrations along with step-by-step instructions.  Also gives wide variety of knots to try.  Overall was very pleased and would highly recommend, especially to someone with little to average experience in knot tieing.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Mi hijo es fan de Starwars y esta edición es fantástica. Excelente calidad de imágen y presentación del pack. Wonderfull!
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|Great movie, fast paced and kept me interested. I like the direction as well. Good acting and supportive cast. I would recommend it
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|We bought this movie after renting it.  We love this movie.  Some of the language in the movie is unnecessary, but it is still a fun movie for the family.
B007V65R54|5.0|This book has made me stop and think many times about the mental shortcuts we all take and how they can lead us in to trouble.  I also enjoy the amount of cites used as it allows me to find more information on a given topic of interest.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Upgrade to version on iTunes update it update it update it update it update it update it update it update it
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was a little predictable but, it was an amazing book. I couldn't put it down once I started. Loved it
B00009YOQW|5.0|Grandson loves it and is driving his parents nuts. A grandparents dream. Good quality and tone, seems very well built.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Makes you think, but not to the point where it gives you a migraine (a la Inception). Tremendous acting<br />by Levitt and Willis.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie!  I read all of the books and wasn't disappointed in the movie!  Can't wait until Catching Fire comes out!
B008L1DNGI|5.0|This is a puzzle game, that is a lot of fine and require some thought to make your next move. Works great on my Motorola RAZR HD. No delays or crazy permissions. Great but at $0.99! Give it a try and see for yourself!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Great show! I cant help but to watch it again and again! It makes me laugh so hard every time!
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Great season. Lots of action and suspense throughout. Can't wait to see the next one-will buy as soon as it's released.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|Good movie, well filmed and acted.  Pitt's a great actor. Interesting and unusual film concept.  I still don't get the Hurricane Katrina references.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing, I loved the movie as well. I will recommend it to everyone. It's a must have, especially if you love musical movies.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't one of the better ones.  I bought this to keep in my collection of DVDs.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book will hook you from the beginning and never let go. It is romantic, suspenseful, tender, and chilling all at the same time!
0307887960|5.0|After two babies,I was over weight by sixty pounds. This book helped me to lose the baby weight and get back into my skinny jeans. Life changing. The first phase is hard, but the instant weight loss was enough to keep me motivated. The second phase is easy and the weight melts off and many bad habits get evaluated and discarded. I have kept the weight off and, eating normally, gained no weight this holiday season. Amazing!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to play if you have any spare time on your hands,  easy to learn and easy to play!
B00846WWVM|5.0|Fun cute game for all ages. Watched our grandkids play it on their devices. Had to get it for mydelf
B009WO7NQO|5.0|if you like star wars and angery birds this is the combination for you! what are you waiting for get it!!!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Love this movie.  Watch it multiple times every year, and it is awesome!  Just upgraded to Blu-Ray, and wanted it for my collection.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Great kick a$$ TEXAS ROCKN'ROLL!!!!Love the new songs can't wait to see them up here in the crap hole North East , NY...
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Most of these are gifts for our Son who had them for a VCR, the Bodyguard was for me as it is a classic and our Son had never seen it but loved it when he did.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|The history, the scenery, the acting - nothing to complain about.  This is a superb movie.  Definitely rates a 5 star.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was awesome.  I highly recommend if you need a good read that will make you feel warm and fuzzy
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|The best season yet!  Donna is wonderful and keeps the Doctor in check.  Great chemistry between them.  This completes my set.
B004SKQAJI|5.0|This guy is amazing!  I bought a bunch of these as Christmas gifts for my family, and everybody loves them!
B005LAII80|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray 3D. It's a shame that people didn't go see this because they thought it was either a sequel to Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd or it was going to be the same campy type of movie. Perfect example, when I was inline to watch it someone asked me what I recommend I told him Dredd he kinda laughed and said \\"The 'I AM THE LAW' guy? really? The first one wasn't that good for a part two.\\" WTF!!!? I told him it was not a sequel, but he didn't care.<br /><br />So to all of you out there who are still thinking of the old Judge...THIS IS NOT NOT YOUR FATHER'S DREDD!! Do your self a favor and buy it! For a price of $21.96 you will not regret it, It's violently entertaining! One other thing, this was supposed to be part one of a trilogy, since it didn't do well at the box office hopefully if enough people pass on the word that it is a good movie they can make up for losses and get the next one going.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I don't watch many war movies, but I decided to watch this one because the actors were actual real vets, and I think it's that element that made this movie truly incredible. The movie is very well acted, and very well produced and portrayed the patriotism of our great men and women in the services in a heart tugging way. Well worth the time.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Wonderful...Wonderful...I Loved It....I would recommend CD to everyone!!!!!  Get your copy now...I could listen to it all day....Rod Stewart Merry Christmas, Baby
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The book was written well and I loved the story line it had and the characters were well thought out.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I payed 3 bucks for this app because I saw my older brother playing it on his Iphone and it looked really fun. I was debating on whether I should buy it since its 3 dollars and that's a lot for an app. I did buy it though and it wont even download. Thanks a lot. If you have a Kindle Fire I suggest not taking the chance of downloading this app because you might just be wasting your money.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Bought this to round out my DVD set collection of H P. Except now I think I will have to buy it on Blu-Ray.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I have seen the first two seasons, and I have to say that I<br />don't think it is as good as Season 1...but it is still good, and I<br />am going to watch the entire thing.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Always loved the character and cockiness of John Corey. Bringing in Paul Brenner was a good twist. Also like the descriptions of Sana'a and the customs of Yemen. Good story and very gripping. Very long and took my whole vacation. A welcome break from my next Jack Reacher story :-)
0525958002|5.0|The book was for my daughter.It got here on time and in good condition.I didn't read it so i can't comment on its content.
B008OHV5HS|4.0|While listening to March of Progress, my consistent thoughts about the album are:<br /><br />• Progressive metallic expression as we have come to expect from Threshold, and backed up by an awesome sound production that not many albums can compete with.<br />• Saga / Kansas type of firmly executed progressive arrangements with great timing and phrasing which (takes time even in the fastest pace compositions and) emphasizes every tone carrying the key harmonies within the composition.<br />• David Gilmour style of guitar fire and progressive mood.<br />• Michael Schenker type of melodic metallic shredding. However, with a nicely expanded guitar lick vocabulary in solos compared to what we heard on previous Threshold albums – a nice refreshment (for example, but not limited to more hammer-on technique than before, if I am hearing correctly).<br />• Powerful and very musical vocals with a touch of Jon Anderson tone colour, however, a full voice at all times and no falsetto.<br />• Is this the best Threshold album so far? Possibly … to some tastes … we will see how it grows on us over time.<br />• 4.5 out of 5 stars, from my end.
B0094LDZ9E|1.0|Happy Feet was anything but happy for me. The social messages ruined the movie for me, along with the sexually suggestive scene. The big killer though is the zoo scene. The zoo scene bothered me so much that I decided not to renew my season pass to the local zoo.<br /><br />I wish I had never seen this movie. I walked out of this movie feeling very sad.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I have watched various adaptations of this Dickens classic and wanted to read the story as an attempt to gauge which movies were the closest to the original text.  As it turns out, the 1951 version with Alistair Sim is truest to the original, although some omissions were made there as well to adapt it to the screen... as you would expect with a book adaptation.  Still, the original story is a joy to read and the 1840's vernacular is quite entertaining, if thought-provolking at times.  A good read.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book is good but I love it this way because you do not have to buy the book in paperback and it takes less room in my room on my book shelf
B003B02PF4|4.0|Was a pretty good book, and easy to read. I enjoy John Grisham's writing style. I would recommend this book.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult novel. Not knowing what to expect, I was so pleasantly surprised. There were twists and turns, a love story , and a message to be heard. I very much enjoyed this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are so many games and many are challenging. But it's fun :) I like it because it forces you to think about different methods for solving one obstacle.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Testament's been around for a long time and have put out some awesome records.  In my opinion, this is one of their best records to date!  Awesome, and a MUST HAVE for any Metalhead's collection!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|great transaction, fast delivery, great price. I would buy from this seller again. thank you for the professional service. thanks again
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This review is only of the Amazon Instant Video version of the movie Looper. As the title says, the sound quality of this version of the movie was very low. At times the movie was entirely inaudible. This may be due to low volume recording levels in the movie itself; not having seen any other versions of it, I don't know what it's like on DVD or on the big screen. I only know that I had to replay parts of the instant download many times in order to follow the dialogue. Sometimes even replaying a scene three times was not enough to figure out what was being said and I had to give up.<br /><br />I watched this movie on a MacBook Pro. I had my MBP volume up to maximum and the movie's sound also at maximum, and still the volume was inaudible in many places. If you're streaming this movie to a TV via a Wii, Xbox or Roku you might have more control over the volume than I did. I hope if you watch the Amazon Instant Video version of Looper you'll post your experience here to compare it with mine. And I hope your experience with it will be better than mine. From my experience, I cannot recommend the Amazon Instant Video version of this movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought it started out slow and didn't keep up with all the hype, but the development was great and the ending left something lingering and wondering.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This item was sent in great condition at a great price. I recommend this movie for family night, it was fun.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Okay so I LOVE this movie. I've heard so many referneces to it in other movies and TV shows, so I finally sat down and watched it. It doesn't if you're 16 or 56... this movie has definitely stood the test of time. And faces real problems that young people do face, letting it be known that all of them aren't something to be overlooked. These actors capture a feeling like no other. It's funny, bittersweet, and time well spent. An absolute MUST-SEE!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Except for the pop-up ads appearing every other hand dealt, this is a terrific, well designed app.<br />The best and easiest solitaire app I have played.
B007HACDLK|5.0|We need more Mitch Rapp's in this world! Vince Flynn is a patriot! I'm looking forward to the upcoming movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot and have played it many times. I prefer this over the traditional Angry Birds game.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I feel in love with their music as soon as I heard stars. Now I'm in love with the song \\"Angels\\".
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This adapter is a must have item if you have one of the new Apple iMacs, or other new Apple computers.<br />Most of my external hard drives are Firewire 800 and will not connect to the computer without this adapter. With it I have access to all my drives. Works like a charm.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A hit with the entire family.  Being Star Wars fanatics to begin with this was sure to be a hit, my 4 year old and 36 yr old husband both love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I just can't justify all the 5 star reviews here. To me, 5 stars means a classic. This is definitely NOT a classic. I can't believe adults give this romantic pap 5 stars. Yes, the plot is mildly interesting and the characters are fairly sympathetic. I can't justify the ratings that Amazon readers have given, however. I am disappointed that I spent Christmas gift money on this highly rated teen fluff.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another good Harry Bosch book! Harry is getting older but better. Maybe Maddie will  carry on when Herry is gone?
0671510991|5.0|The author point of view is astonishing. I got surprise.<br />I recommend it to all interested on intenational affairs.<br />Very good.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My son loves these books and this is another funny one.  These books keep him entertained and I quite often hear him laugh out loud.  THis makes me happy because he otherwise can be a too-serious child and sad alot.  These books make him laugh.
B008602KQI|5.0|The books were wonderful and the movie does not disappoint. My husband had not read the books, and he really liked the movie. It made him want to read the books.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|i enjoyed this book although it was predicable and had an interesting twist at the end<br />somewhere in thisbook you will relate to one of the characters
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book finished all three in four days. Very intriguing set of books. I had a hard time putting it down.
B000009HF2|2.0|I thought I was getting the entire album. I only got the second album of the recording. I should have bee informed it was not the entire album!
B005LAIHZE|2.0|Not a very good movie. There is really not much more to say. Very poor script but good actors. Pinning this movie on Abe, come on !
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought these discs for two of my sisters for Christmas.  I have no idea if they have watched them yet but since I have the individual disc sets that I purchased last year, I am assuming these are as good.  My set from last year was fabulous.  I have heard some spoilers from season 3 and am not happy.  I am hoping the rumors are false.  BUT the first two years are great.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun little game to play and pass the time. Great when you have 5 minutes to kill. Not terribly accurate, but amusing times.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|Not very easy to use with Kindle. Navigation is difficult and much is left to trial and error. When I went online to access my account and organize it, all the music previously entered, disappeared.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I feel very secure with this app. It's easy to use and works awesome...I have recommended this app to about 10 people who also love it
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great app for casual play.  Not too hard and not too easy.  Would definitely recommend this game, it is worth the money.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A good read. Interesting info on all of his training. I agree with the author, he did not do anything to divulge classified info or tactics. He displayed the values and superior training and dedication of his fellow Seals. Good Job! CAPT, USN Retired
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Bought this game for my son's Kindle.  He loves it and so does my husband.  They could play for hours and quite often do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a fantastic series.  It deserves nine hundred stars.  I love the day to day lives of the<br />Family in Dowton Abbey.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I liked the twists, the violence is a bit much but fits the story.  I like time travel stories and this one has a different take.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So easy to use...easily the best one out there! The large buttons make it that much easier to use especially when you're in a hurry.
1451695195|4.0|I liked the book and of course it leaves many questions dangling.  I want to believe that miracles still happen today,
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I've never been a huge Bob Marley fan until my wife and I went to Jamaica.  His music is really passionate and just puts you in a great mood.  It always takes us back to the sunny island.
030759565X|5.0|And I love the food.  Tasty, easy to follow and easy to make dishes.  Nice to have a cook book that does not require fancy ingredients and a run to the store to only find out that the grocer does not carry it.
0399250573|5.0|Favorite books, Highly recommended to an reader, especially to any age 10-20.  Great reads and stimulates the imagination quite a bit.
076781326X|5.0|This is a great movie for the entire family to watch together on movie night.  They don't make movies like this anymore.
1423136802|5.0|I bought these as a gift for one of my nieces for Christmas. Her face lit up when she opened the gift so I would say she loved it!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|We are big fans of this series. This is the 5th one I have bought. My husband thinks this is one of the best series on TV ....
B00024I2Z4|4.0|I was actually at Disney while they were creating Mulan, so I got to watch some of the artists work.  It was a very cool experience.  It's one of the better Disney movies.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Enjoyed the game and I know the younger kids would enjoy the graphics. Easy puzzles and adorable characters. If you like Cut the Rope, you'll like this.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|after reading the synopsis I was hesitant but other reviews piqued my interest. It is brilliant. Well constructed and well written it is a page turner.
0425252868|5.0|An outstanding account of honor and chivalry. Having had the honor of meeting Franz on several occasions, we had heard the story before, but never like this. What a great narrative of a truly honorable man, a good German and as I have found out over the years, not the only one!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Love good cowboy movies and am a sci-fi fan from way back. Put the two together and you have a very fun film.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|Coldplay's X&Y meets Depeche Mode's Enjoy the silence. This is a great album, I would recomend it to anyone I know
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a very well-written and acted series on PBS.  I was recently introduced to it by my coworkers and I love it!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. only downfall is wait to build energy... If it would allow you to build energy faster I would be happier with it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Honestly, there are few books that hold my attention from the beginning to the end, but this was one. Intelligent mystery writing.
0062202081|3.0|I ordered \\"Justin Bieber: Just Getting Started\\" for my granddaughter. I glanced through it but don't know how many stars to give it since it's not for me and I did not read it. It \\"looked\\" like something she would enjoy so I'll give it three stars.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I'm on my second reading of the five books, I hope George R.R. lives to finish the story. I can't wait for season 2 on Bluray.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Everyone in my family now plays this game and loves it!  We have it on our tablet, kindle and iPods.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Was this intended to be The Sea of Tranquility fan fiction?  It was a decent read but the similarities between the two are endless and Tranquility set the bar so high this one suffers in comparison.  I enjoyed the author's previous books but this was a bit..... unimaginative.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I this is a funner way to look up stuff and I chose this because this is the only thing I have to read
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|My child blew through $200 in 3 days buying the gems/treats, etc.  This looks completely predatory, targeted at kids but selling boxes of treats for $10.  Ridiculous, stay away from this game.
B004SDEP38|4.0|It's just what I wanted. Thanks for the quick service.  Easy to find and easy to order.  Keep up the good work.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Love Mitch Rapp, the character pulls no punches just like Jack Bauer in 24. Hope Flynn can find a replacement for Rapp, as the guy has got to be feeling his age.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|All I have to say is that I luv my Facebook.,,,this app works properly and never gives me any trouble...Im happy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't write long, plot summarizing reviews as there are plenty doing that already.  My opinion on this book:  Painfully sad, but also funny and romantic. I absolutly loved it and it made me so thankful for the healthy kids in my life (to quote the St. Jude commercial).
B008P1EWIM|5.0|A+++++ Great app! Everything you need in a weather app. Love the graphics! Beautiful!  Highly recommended! A++++++ A+++++ five stars!
B00005N6KG|1.0|The cord was way too short and I couldn't use it.  Luckily a coworker bouhght it from me or I would have returned it immediately.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|It's just what I wanted. Thanks for the quick service.  Easy to find and easy to order.  Keep up the good work.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I just love this album.  I know I'll wear it out because it's always on in my car.  I am looking forward to purchasing more by Adele.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Excelente producto y  buen servicio, recomendable tienen buen precio,  calidad y rapidez, estoy conforme con el servicio<br /><br />muchas gracias<br /><br />Saludos<br />Valente
B005IQZB14|5.0|A wonderfully written story about finding oneself. I could really relate to Cheryl Strayed's story. It gives me courage to keep pushing forward in my own life.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I'm a avid reader and this series came highly recommended. While I enjoy it, it reads very slowly. I like that every chapter is from a different characters point of view, but it's dragging on. I will finish this one, but not sure if I'm interested in the next four in the series as they are just as long.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Every since I first heard this group I have been in love. The complexity of their music is so awesome. They continue to amaze me with their talent and use of industry tools available to them. Definitely worth the money!!
B004SIP9VA|5.0|It's just what I wanted. Thanks for the quick service.  Easy to find and easy to order.  Keep up the good work.
0920668372|5.0|I first heard this book when I taught school.  I'm retired now but continue to suggest this book to others.  I last bought it from Amazon when a close relative was blessed with a beautiful son.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This book is the bees knees! I love love love love love love love love love the walking dead! !
B005R32L66|4.0|The app is fine. It's a nice clean easy interface. I wish the file wasn't so big. I moved it to my SD since I don't have a lot of space on my internal drive. But the camera won't work with it for some reason - maybe because it's working from the SD? I don't know, but I think I'll just keep using it on my laptop.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Very slow start along with first half. Also once you put 2 + 2 together, the suspense was gone. Doing so was not that hard  .
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Weird just doesn't seem right. Parents didn't know what he was doing?  All there fault. But it had so good points and was and easy read
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It's just what I wanted. Thanks for the quick service.  Easy to find and easy to order.  Keep up the good work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is very easy to find the specific book and verse you want . There are a lot of  versions to compare . I will recommend it to my friends.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|just started playing, haven't gotten very far but I love the way the game looks. enjoy hidden objects. so far so good
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I actually ended up deleting this from my tablet. It didn't really seem to do anything special for me that I can't do just by logging into FB from the browser. It's a nice easy to use and clean interface. I have no complaints about that. My big complaint is that it is a fairly large-sized app. It took up quite a bit of space on my internal drive. I thought about moving it to the SD, but figured it wasn't worth the trouble. I'll just log in on the browser.
B004SBBDB2|5.0|This cable is a great way to display streaming Netflix on your iphone on your tv.  The quality isnt super sharp (on a 42 inch 1080 pm LCD) but it doesnt look very bad at all.  We use this to watch movies etc at our summer camp where we dont want to pay for cable.  It does the job.  YOu have to make sure that the specific app you are using allows for the output.  For example, display on the TV works with our Netflix app but not with YouTube.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|when a great game. it kept my boyfriend and I busy for hours. until the battery went dead...lol. we will play it again
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It's just what I wanted. Thanks for the quick service.  Easy to find and easy to order.  Keep up the good work.
0743270754|5.0|Fantastic book.  Wonderfully detailed and written. Doris Kearns Goodwin paints a vivid picture of the government of Abrahamd Lincoln's time.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|This book was okay and kind of hard to understand. I enjoyed it through.maybe should make. A younger version? It would be helpful
B008JGSM6G|5.0|FUN!! My dad-in-law introduced my 2 yr old daughter to this, so I downloaded it, too. My daughter doesn't get it, of course, but I have become addicted!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This is one of those movies that had I paid for it in a theater, I would have been fairly mad.  As it stands, I'm mildly irritated.<br /><br />The plot was interesting and a dark take on the original story of Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs.  However, there were times that what was going on was confusing.  For one, the canned British accents from the American actors tended to be confusing, and then the thick accents from other actors made understanding the story line even more confusing as to what was going on.<br /><br />Charlize Theron was wonderful as Queen Ravenna.  However, the whole thing with her brother was just.... weird.  Really weird. If he was supposed to be sharing her ability to remain ageless, his spell needed some tweaking, and that whole caressing and attending her while she was fairly naked thing was borderline incestuous.<br /><br />Plus, God help her... while I love the Twilight movies in a perverse way, Kristen Stewart has almost zero range as far as showing emotions in a movie.  It was hard to tell when she was happy, sad, angry, elated, frightened, or just there... like a rock.  I swear she and Keanu Reeves should do a movie together and call it Apathy The Movie.  Plus, what happened with the ending?  Yes, she was crowned Queen, but what happens with the romance after that?<br /><br />The visual effects were stunning and interesting.  The scenery was beautiful, but as far as everything else.... this movie left me scratching my head and wondering what all the hype was about.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked it .it was very funny.I would really was it again but I already know what's goin to happen.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Excited for the movie in February! He brings the book to life with his words. Awesome!
1419705849|5.0|My students and I absolutely love this book series!  We can't wait for the next installment.  Hope it comes out soon!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I have to say this book was very good. It started off slow and I almost stopped reading it but, I'm glad I didn't. It's definitely worth the read.
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|Hard to read, cannot expand font  size.<br />Sorry that I down loaded this hard to read book.<br />Don't down load this book.
B004G600A4|5.0|We are huge Disney fans. This is a great movie with grandkids over to visit often we may have watched this 20 times already and we still enjoy it. It is another Disney Clasic.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Love everything about this book. Second time reading it and it was if it was the first time. Couldn't put it down.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I love the show!  I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan and I have read all of the books.  It gives me something to do while waiting for the UK show &#34;Sherlock&#34;.  I love both modern day versions.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really enjoyed reading No Easy Day. It's a relatively quick read, is well paced, and well organized. It gives a great glimpse into the lives of people we will never meet, but who work tirelessly to defend our country.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it four stars is that even while the book goes into good detail, it's clear to me that many important details were changed or left out. This is probably due to the nature of classified material, but if we're going to write a book about the &#34;inside account&#34;, those details would be nice to have.<br /><br />For instance, Mr. Owen constantly refers to the Blackhawks used in the raid. But anyone who has seen pictures of the tail of the crashed &#34;Blackhawk&#34; knows that it was no &#34;typical&#34; Blackhawk. He fails to address any differences or modifications -- key information that I was hoping to read about in an &#34;inside account.&#34;<br /><br />I'd still highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a well thought out account of the Bin Laden raid and the general life and thoughts of members of SEAL teams.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing I love how at the end of each chapter it's kind of a cliff hanger and it keeps you reading.
B005LAII8A|4.0|This is a futuristic action film that has a time-travel concept, which is one of my favorite concepts. The film plays out a sort of a \\"battle\\" between the future version and the present version whereas the \\"Future Joe\\" will do anything to preserve his life, even to save his wife, but the \\"younger Joe\\" doesn't care about that since Future Joe's memory is now only a \\"possibility,\\" not a definite, as he only see \\"the now.\\" Future Joe is driven by his own need for survival, and ironically, so is the young Joe. That is the powerful conflict, which is interesting.<br /><br />The other concept that is interesting is an ability to move objects with one's hand/mind, known as \\"TK.\\" At first, I was wondering why would you have two different yet paranormal abilities into the same story, then I realized that a child whose TK will become so powerful in the future that became the man that Future Joe very much wanted to kill. So, the idea that if you travel back in time to kill Hitler, he would be a child when you see him...then the question is: would you do it? Future Joe plays that out by desiring to kill a younger version of an evil tyrant that he perceived.<br /><br />But, here's the rub. Future Joe came from a \\"probable\\" future, and by coming back, he has changed it but still ended up doing what he feared: he'd create the version of the man that he very much wants to take out. There was no possibility of the child turning out to be \\"good\\" in his mind and that the child needs to be taken out. There is the child's mother who believes the good in the child, there is a futuristic man who believes the child to be evil no matter what, but there is the young Joe who have a choice between letting the child to grow up or be killed. In the end, that choice was made to which Future Joe haven't at least expected.<br /><br />Personally, this is very good movie with such an originality. It's a good story that will get a viewer thinking about the concept of time travel and the idea of a \\"loop.\\"p.\\"
B003DT19F0|5.0|We have all the tinker bell movies this is our favorite. The whole family of all ages are big tinker bell fans. we bought this for everyone not just the kids.
B00846REIS|5.0|Depth of story keeps you wanting more. Characters with pasts they fight against to make a life together. Loved it!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This  game is fun but hard if u don't imagine all the possibilities still love it though it's worth a download
B007V9N5R8|4.0|I've used this product for a few weeks now. It certainly does make pretty big changes in the display. However, since I have nothing to compare it to, I'm left wondering if it's actually the optimal change. I'd give five stars, but I have a dual-display setup and the colormunki calibration leaves both displays slightly different, which concerns me. They're not completely different, but it's noticeable. I figured under the same ambient lighting conditions, a calibrated monitor would be a calibrated monitor -- not have slight differences. So for that reason I am rating four stars.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I always like to hear about NDE from different sources.  It stimulates my curiosity.  I know folks who have had this experience.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We've watched this movie 4 times since we rented it! My 3 year old lives it! My husband and I have also enjoyed it. Good family movie.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod pulled it off. My wife is a huge Rod Steward fan so we had to buy it. We thought it would be just another Christmas album but he did a great job.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Boring I really didn't read it so much more than one million dollars in the world of this year ago by e
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The story line, the Scottish turn of phrase, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters ... it can't help but be wonderful. Fun!
B0054SMID0|5.0|I must say that I originally selected this movie because I am a fan of Matthew. I was pleasantly surprised that he was very good (and not just eye candy)in this movie. I really liked this movie. In fact, I watched 3 movies back to back,  really enjoyed them all but this was the winner of the three(Warrior, and The music never stopped were the other 2). This movie held my attention the entire movie. For a movie in its class, It was an A+.
B004H4XLR4|4.0|This 'Sid' jet plane from Cars 2 is pretty cool, and my 3 yr old loves it, but I rather feel that it's not as well built as the die-cast cars that it's designed to go with. After the string for the tow cable came off twice in a week, and the end is now hopelessly lost inside the mechanics of the plane somewhere, I'm just not convinced it's going to survive all that long. The wings in particular feel a shade delicate, with no bottom surface to the wings to give them strength. The door on the top to access the interior also feels destined to break one day.<br /><br />I also wish that the landing gear were just a smidge taller, making it easier to fold the ramp when he's sitting on a surface, and easier to get Mater on board (an important part of the Cars 2 story). And speaking of landing gear, although it's certainly not important, I kind of wish the landing gear could retract like many of the airplanes from the Imaginext line by Fisher-Price.<br /><br />Still, if you're a Cars fanatic like my boys and me, I think Sid's an important and fun addition to your die-cast car collection.
B003PM5Y4M|5.0|This is a great movie, very racist at times, but all the acting is very good and also very funny.
0451232852|5.0|It's a great book. A great story and a beautifully written romance.<br /><br />It's full of historical details. Had a great time reading it. Looking forward for the 2nd book of the series.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Minecraft is a copyright of mojang stop copying it buy minecraft instead of this crap<br />It sucks I bought the demo the controls are also weird u suck candy Rufus!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Yet another great story about LA with lots of details of a grim time there, as well as the character of Harry Bosch.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Totally unexpected turn of events. Just as the story was slowing down and in a seemingly predictable rut it took a completely different path than expected. It kept my attention whetting my appetite for more with the numerous twists and turns of the story line. Well done.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Wes Anderson, where have you gone wrong? I loved Rushmore and then Royal Tannenbaums a bit less. This movie has just fallen off the cliff. The look still has some appeal albeit the novelty is gone, it looks like a film made by the Instragram app. Bill Murray is excellent in another version of his broken man character but overall this film should be skipped.
B0099114WO|5.0|Loved....Loved...the soundtrack,the script, and the cast. GREAT ACTING!GREAT MOVIE!  Ignore bad reviews. This movie is for real couples.  It deals with real issues and is a great tool to begin dialogue to improve your marriage. If you like fantasy then this movie is not for you.  This movie is for REAL people, REAL couples! Excellent Movie and great for your movie library.
0525952926|5.0|It's a great book. A great story and a beautifully written romance.<br /><br />It's full of historical details. Had a great time reading it. Looking forward for the 3rd book of the series.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|I absolutely adored this book! It had a great plot and the characters were so well developed I could picture everything I was reading with vivid detail. The ending was perfect. I couldn't put it down! A overall marvelous book I enjoyed every minute of it! Please write a sequel!
B008J344BQ|5.0|This was described perfectly explained the product as best as it could.  My daughter loved it very much.  Thank you.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Honestly one of the best books I have ever read.<br />Beautiful and thought provoking. A modern masterpiece. I just finished it and am about to start it again.
0894803123|5.0|Purchased two of these - one for myself and one for my son in law. There are lots of fabulous recipes and both of us are anxious to try as many as possible. He has found some containers to be able to keep extra in the freezer.
B001EOQWF8|1.0|Visually stunning but the movie consists of endless boring chase scenes between the robots. The scenes of Wall-e and EVA being chased on the spaceship makeup for half the movie time. Wall-e is cute and there is an important message about saving earth and plant life- but that cute robot and message were copied from the science fiction classic \\"Silent Running\\" . Even the design of Wall-e was ripped of from that movie. Disney added binoculars for eyes, but its the same robot design. Too many concepts and scenes just drag on in this film. The floor mopping robot for example, is shown over and over again without adding anything to the film.
1400052173|4.0|It's a great book about a tragic story.<br /><br />Besides the story of the life of Henrietta Lacks, it gives amazing details of the early days of cell culture and the amazing scientific development of the field.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have enjoyed the whole journey. I hope the movie does the book justice. On to book two. I'm sure I'll like it just as well. The book was great!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|This was a gift and I got it at a great sale price. I couldn't attest to it's quality, because it was a Christmas gift, but it did come in new packaging.
159420411X|5.0|It's the best general discussion of prediction in the social sciences (and some natural sciences too).  Because of its great breadth most topics are not covered in depth.  But the range of the discussion, from economics to earthquakes and poker to politics, and the general principles (mainly Bayesian) drawn from that range of examples, make the book quite unique.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I bought this for my son and he love it!!! I would recommend to watching Season one and two first.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Bought the Kindle originally as a birthday present for a senior citizen who loves it.  When the cable went bad I replaced it with this one.  She is now a very happy campter.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|If you like twilight, you're gonna LOVE the beautiful creatures series. Love,LOVE,love these books the characters, the plot,the whole story is super
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book in 24 hours... and pre ordered the second one this morning.... =) this will be a hard love story to top....
B005LAII8K|1.0|The UltraViolet version that &#34;comes with&#34; this movie is horrible. It took 2 days to download and then it's in a format that can only be used with Sony's horrible software. It's basically a terrible copy of iTunes. If you're buying this so that you can get a digital copy along with your disc I would go another route.
0142418471|5.0|Such a great book! Two excellent but quite different authors come together to take you on a hilarious and emotional trip through the lives of a couple very real feelign young people.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy and addictive. Ads only come up between games, so they do not interrupt your game. I like the tap to place feature instead of having to drag each card.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great conclusion to the the hunger games series and I absolutely loved the end. Like all the other books it was thrilling and kept me wanting to read Moore. I highly  recommend this book to readers who enjoy exhilarating tales because that's exactly what this book is.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I just wanted to give this book five stars. Whatever you do, don't ruin it for others after you are done!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|fun game doesn't take to long to build things kids enjoy playing and good for killing time I haveny had to buy anything so far lots of quest
B003O86FMW|5.0|No words can be put in to how spontaneous and amazing this series was it over rides the twilight saga by a large number
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of those books you can't put down.  Had to find out how far she would go. Author did a great job for her fist time writing a novel.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|So hilarious I want to tell the whole world about how hilarious it is diary of a Wimpy Kid is so hilarious
B005LJKEXS|5.0|The cable is a nice silvery gray color under the smokey plastic casing.  The low-profile female plug makes a sturdy connection to the existing USB cable male.  Our printer is working fine so far with one of these extenders; this product worked perfectly for what we needed.  I'd buy another of this exact cable if I needed one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Math to wake me up...whoever thought of this was genius. The app works great and so far I have no complaints.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I love it a d I love to draw something but one day I was drawing something but then the screen turn black and went back to home ...... I tried like 23 to go back in the game but it does the same thing... turns black and goes to home.... if you want to download it. Be careful that you don't have the same thing I have...
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Appreciate an author and a human being with the intestinal fortitude to tell the truth about the killing of OBL.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book so much. I gave it five stars cause it includes romance, science,drama,etc. I would recommend this book to be read by a number of people between the ages of  12 years of age and up. I know that you will love to read it. The movie is even better than the book and part 2 is awesome I would recommend that you read the books first and then watch the movies they are way better they have more facts and action.I love breaking dawn I really love all four books and movies but I love breaking dawn part 2 better than all the other movies and books
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Tin Tin is a fun film with plenty of action and mystery. It was a bit predictable, at least for a 27 year old Sherlock Holmes like myself. Nonetheless, Tin Tin is intelligent and resourceful. Probably a better \\"hero\\" for kids than some of the more violent characters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read the book because I saw the TV prom for the movie. After I started the book I could not put it down. Will read the next two books.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|I really enjoyed this until I got to the point that I couldn't go any further without paying to unlock the game.  This is so deceptive and it makes me very angry.  I will think long and hard before I buy another game from this manufacturer.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as exciting as the first book. Keeps you on your toes and turning the page. Love seeing the story unfold.
B008476HBM|5.0|I bet you just loved that Mr. Darcy. Well, yes. Yes, Tom Hanks. I did just love that Mr. Darcy.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Bought as a Christmas present and arrived quickly and in great condition. Already in use and the quality of the picture is perfect for watching your favorite characters :)
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Since the Amazon provided player does NOT list MP4 movies, you can't tell which title you are selecting.  I loaded aVia (free for limited capability) to try it and it does NOT work on the HD 8.9\\".  It does provide listings of the movies and a screen shot but all you get are periodic frames and static noise.  It would be nice if Amazon provided a quality player for their quality product but I guess that's not to be.  Very disappointed.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the way he intertwined the stories with historical information. Very enjoyable. Only problem I am ready for the third book and it will not be published until 2014. Disappointing.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Fast paced. Lots of action. Mitch Rapp shows human side. Somewhat redundant theme for Flynn but good anti terrorism theme.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never read a book like this before and I was not able  to put it down. It was a page turner and I couldn't wait to see what happened next and all my predictions were not correct so it also kept me interested. Also what an emotional roller coaster.....
B001FVMIWQ|5.0|Love the cover art, the music is excellent.  Bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, he loved it too.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|We had seen this movie before and enjoyed it so much we gave it as a gift!  Good for the whole family!
B007EECSFA|4.0|The characterization and plot progression of The Secret Keeper hold my attention, and the twists at the end are well-done.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I like to play joyride jetpack because it is really fun to play.  It is exciting!  Getting coins is easy and fun.  My 6 yr old son purchased this and wanted to post a review because it was so much fun.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This film is a variation of Terminator 2. Man goes back in time to, essentially, kill Hitler. Big production costs melt down quickly to small town woman and little boy dealing with a rouge cop from the future. And Bruce Willis is a tertiary character. Any actor could have played his part.<br /><br />The film was a big disappointment.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Who would think Tom Cruze could sing. Or pull off acting like Axel Rose. The Monkey is  great as Hey Man.... The whole cast has you going. The music is great. It was so enjoyable I bought it. Originally I rented it.
B003L20IJM|5.0|We enjoyed this one as much as the first Nanny McPhee!  Great movie that pulls at your heartstrings! Love it!
B000FC10WU|4.0|Body In The Library:  One of Marple's better books. I love you English characters! Her &#34;village&#34; characters are truely wonderful.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|love this movie and a must see! I recommend this movie to all! I am a girl/mom and am a huge fan of all the movies but I thought they did a great job putting the movie together and Ii think all the actors greatly fit there roles! love it!
0596009208|5.0|I am an experienced C programmer who wanted to learn Java as a basis for Android development. I was a little skeptical at first that the informal style of the book would cover enough material in depth. Boy was I wrong. This is probably the best programming book I have ever read. Not only is all the material covered but its FUN and interesting. The little exercises at the end of each chapter were very helpful and the code examples in the book are small enough that I typed each one in and compiled it as I went along. I can't recommend this book highly enough!
B00846REIS|3.0|Good story.  Very similar to 50 Shades in alot of ways.  I will definitely continue to the next book in the series.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|My first HD movie on my new tv!  I enjoyed this, but the movie starts slow with Batman as a gimp from the last movie.  It slowly heats up and gets good. Plus, Bane is downright scary and Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was good casting.
B00A23MYCC|3.0|Very funny, but bordering on being silly.  The extras are a waste of time.  I laughed,but sometimes wondered why I did.
1419702238|5.0|I recommed this book for a child or adult! this book is very funny! I get all of the books series for my son then he gives them to me to read (mom) - I find them funny or just cute but either way - a good book:) I always get excited when jeff kinney comes out with his next book!
1449415881|5.0|Can't miss.  As with every year's calendar, you get a little bit of humor every day....<br />need three more words
B000Q76K1A|5.0|This movie is for all those that realize that a hero is not untouchable! But still despite his limitation of being flesh and blood can still over come and conquer the trials before him...amazing movie! The first of three!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great graphics and keeps you interested! I was so wrapped up in solving everything and finding all of the objects. I definitely recommend this game. good job G5 !!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|A fun ride from start to end.  Must see. Everything you expect to see from a Men in Black film.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband but I love it myself! This is a great movie and a must see/own! I would recommend this movie!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Absolutely excellent movie. Shows how one family can truly make a difference. Sandra Bullick is at top of her game.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|This movie shows a side of bond no other could. Cocky but with skill to back it up! Daniel craig was brilliant! Its definitley the start of a legacy!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Very good. Typical John Grisham with a different ending.  I especially the good guy being successful lawyer in the end.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|As a fan of all of the \\"Alien\\" franchise, I am probably a bit generous with my review. I enjoy most of the films that R. Scott makes as well.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />The weakness here is glaring. The plot does not make much sense, especially in the context of the trilogy. The movie begins as a tense thriller, but quickly devolves into something else entirely. There is a heavy dose of moralistic pontificating (which never works in movies like this). Scott was successful when he did this in Blackhawk Down, but it does not fit here. The characters are barely likeable and they share no chemistry. And after all of those issues, it is the plot that kills the show.<br /><br />The only good about this movie comes from the great visuals and sound. I did manage to watch it all the way through and only yawned twice and stepped out for a refrigerator break once. And I really, really, really wanted to like this movie....if only to atone for the terrible \\"Aliens Resurrection\\" movie that killed the franchise!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|My husband and I are big fans and really liked the movie! I would recommend this movie. great action, story and glad I bought this!
B004LWZVZC|5.0|I love American history, this one makes you think about what the accused were going through. I believe it was well written & well produced.
B00866H7SS|1.0|Couldn't believe I only managed to get through a third of this book ...... just can't go on!!!!<br />Far to similar to FSoG!!!<br />I bought the book after researching Sylvia Day, her other writings are way better than this,<br />what on earth was she thinking?<br /><br />I really enjoyed Fifty shades etc for what it was, 'Erotic Romance'  or  ........light entertainment.<br /><br />I've also read some reviews by others who liked this book, quoting ... 'much better written', 'better story line', they have also said that it's obvious the author is far 'superior' to E.L. James.<br />This maybe so, but at the end of the day it is far too similar to Fifty Shades & follows too closely on the heels of Fifty Shades to have any real merrit in originality!!!<br />Maybe if I had read this book first then I might have had a different view.<br /><br />I found that I got right into the story in FSoG, Ana & Christian, the fun, serious hard limits,& I especially loved the 'Inner Goddess' concious, it added a real touch of humor,we were lead into a story....<br />Not just tossed in, as in this book, (or the copy-cat tripping-into-his-arms scenario).....the first of many, many similarities, it's def NOT an original idea, (but then again most stories have been re-done or re-hashed from time to time) & in fairness to the author, she is a talented writer, but dropped a bummer here.<br /><br />This book leaves me disappointed, my advice......<br />DON'T waste your time or $'s.  : (
0385040253|5.0|So what's the big deal about knots, you say?  For the majority of human history (prior to industrialization and assembly line pre-packaged pre-sized made-to-fit idiot-proof modern conveniences that we've become so dependent on) life would have been impossible without knots. The ability to tie knots ranks right up there with fire and the wheel in terms of its impact on human progress. In short, nothing in modern society, indeed, arguably society itself, would have been possible without knots.<br /><br />ABOK provides easy access to virtually every knot ever used to any significant degree by human beings in our entire history.  (Let THAT one sink in for a second!)  Yes, there have been a handful of knots invented since ABOK that one may find very useful - but those are few and far between.  ABOK contains literally thousands of knots, each of which explained in clear illustrations and language.  And surprisingly, despite its massive content, finding a knot you need is usually pretty straightforward.  Plus - and in my opinion one of the real pleasures of this book - Ashley provides a virtual historical encyclopedia of almost every knot (for example, where they originated, intended and best uses, relative strength, etc.).<br /><br />However, ABOK represents more than simply a reference for finding a knot to tie your lures or anchoring a tent stake - it represents one man's life and passion beautifully and painstakingly documented in a form that others can relate to and appreciate  - a pure and honest contribution to the subject for no other reason than his love for it.  If you've ever thought about doing something meaningful with your life and time and having that effort remembered, you can appreciate why this book truly deserves the term \\"legacy\\".<br /><br />Every so often a single person contributes so significantly within a given field or subject that their work becomes the reference and standard by which all other contributors are judged.  ABOK represents an exampleof that phenomenon. If you're interested at all in knot tying, do yourself a favor and get this book.  It's worth the price.  You'll not only get THE reference and undisputed authoritative standard within the subject, you'll get a work of true historical importance - one that you'll probably use and read for the rest of your life.  Very few books I've encountered earn such a claim.
B000OBYLVO|4.0|This movie is a hit with us & our friends. It is a emotionally healthy & heartwarming holiday movie. We recommend it for adult viewers.
B004U52VPS|3.0|I bought this game for my son when this game was very over priced and hard to find.....man I should of said forget it. My son was not impressed and would not buy as a gift for anyone. I gave this 3 stars because it seems durable and maybe it was a game that was just not for my son. The game seemed boring and with out the funny noises that your app would make the game got old quickly plus the time to constantly set up gets old too.
B009AMANBA|3.0|This movie had a lot of good individual parts: a really good cast, a great director, and a National icon. However, in sum this movie didn't live up to what it could be. The story focuses on the end of the Civil War and Lincoln's push to get the 13th Ammendment through the House of Representatives. Lincoln talks about how he used the powers granted to him because of the war, to pass the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the slaves. He gives a difficult explanation of why he passed it and what he believes in. He keeps saying that he follows the rule of law or something like that and how African Americans are viewed as property by law. This difficult to understand reasoning that he provides is one of the many things that undermine this film from being better.<br /><br />There is a good piece of history in this film and we see Congress and the White House well reproduced. One thing that is obvious is the White House had no fence and no security. I knew this from reading Killing Lincoln but it was still amazing to see it portrayed so realistically.<br /><br />I had great difficulty understanding what many of the actors were saying even Sally Field started prattling on with 1865 idioms making her difficult to understand. So many recognizable faces gave me the same trouble whether it was Hal Holbrook or James Spader.<br /><br />Another thing the movie suffered from was it just got boring at times. Yes there were dramatic parts as Spader and his crew try to sway some of the Lame Duck Democrats to vote for the Ammendment and we saw that the same corruption that exists in Washington today happened back then.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones was excellent in his role though he wears an annoying wig through most of the movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt is excellent as Lincoln's son who fights with his father over enlisting in the war.<br /><br />Finally, Daniel Day Lewis was a good Lincoln, looking a lot like Lincoln, but his voice didn't sound very Lincolnesque.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|This book was a great story to enjoy I liked it a lot. I love reading diary of a wimpy kid. It's one of my favorite books people should really read them. This book is funny and kids will love these books as soon as they read the first page.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|The film is great and the quality of the dvd and blue ray is really good. I enjoy watching it again.
B001992NUQ|5.0|this is a great movie - great story and a must own! I bought this for my husband but I love it as well. This is such a great story, I recommend this movie!
B005LAIIJY|4.0|German Bounty Hunter/Dentist played by Christopher Waltz (who we last saw in Inglorious Basterds) tries to buy Django (Jamie Foxx) from a slaver. The reason? Django can identify three brothers who Waltz is hunting for a bounty. Waltz lets Django know that if he goes with him and points out his bounty, he will free Django and pay him for his trouble.<br /><br />Django agrees to Waltz's offer and Waltz can only get him from the slavers in dramatic fashion (reminicent of Gene Wilder in Blazing Saddles). After that Django becomes Waltz's right hand man in the trade and also turns into a quick draw sharpshooter himself. Waltz seems to take a real liking to Django and agrees to help Django find his wife who was sold off to a separate plantation owner.<br /><br />The movie is loaded with a lot of nods to other famous westerns and at least two more nods to Blazing Saddles (think Cleavon Little when he first rides into town and remember the hooded bad guys later in the film). The film does go over the top with some of the action scenes (think the battle in the club at the end of Kill Bill). And even Samuel Jackson with bad makeup and one of his poorer acting performances fails to distract from the fun of the movie.<br /><br />What really makes this film a winner is Waltz. He is a similar character to his role in Inglorious Basterds (remember one of the most likable bad guys ever) only this time he is a good guy. Foxx is ok but his performance pales in comparison to the one he gave in Collateral. The film runs over 2 hours but it never seems to get borring. Of all the Quentin Tarrantino films I have seen this one is about equal to the first Kill Bill film, but a far cry from either Pulp Fiction or Inglorious Basterds. I give it just under four stars.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I enjoyed the whole book. Not one part did it get boring. Best book once read on a while!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book, couldn't put it down. Hopefully the movie will follow the book. Would be awesome to see how it turns out.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, and Tommy Lee Jones all turn in brilliant performances in this wonderful film. Tony Kushner wrote a great screenplay and Steven Spielberg directed the film magnificently. I loved every minute of this film.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|I bought this for my son but parents will enjoy too! This is a great movie to see - very funny!
0553593544|5.0|I've been absolutely hooked on this book!!  Just when you think it's been a while since any action came up, it hits you right in the face!  I can't put it down.  An absolute must read for a lover of the spy or crime genre.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game and it is great on my kindle and I have no problems with it and me and my husband love these types of games
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I know that this series has several bad reviews but I really enjoyed reading them. There were some parts that were repeated several times like Grey asking her not to leave him and the sex scenes but I like the story line. Could the writing have been better? Of course, but it was a very good and interesting read. If exotic reading is not for you, than this series is not the series for you. In the end, I believe the author desired for the story to be a romance since her inspiration came from Twilight. If you can get past the sex scenes than you will be able to see the romance side the story.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I think it's a great idea to tell this story from the child's perspective.  How innocent all children are and naive.  It's crazy to think how adaptable a human can be to have to survive.  Then to think of the adjustment phase afterwards.<br />However the story is good the book starts out kind of slow.  If I had just bought the sample I might not have continued to read.  I'm not a big lover of useless information.  A little here and there is okay but I do feel as though inadequate parts of the book are well more detailed than more of the interesting topics.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I love this movie and that they did a great job having the movie as close to the book as possible! I would recommend this movie!
B002Z7FWBI|4.0|What can I say?  My husband loves these. This was a good selection, most of which we did not have.
B004RL9T50|4.0|Good movie, our grandsons enjoyed seeing it a second time. (Note: I have nothing more to say. Please take the ten word requirement off your review requests)
1449415881|5.0|got to love dilbert! what more to say. Sure some can complain about the combined days of the weekend, but its at my desk at work, so it doesnt bother me at all.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Loved the book. Gives you a lot of helpful suggestions about how to defeat destructive negative thought patterns. I disliked the first couple of words the the kindle addition publisher added to the book, something like &#34;this book is a product of its time&#34;. Dear publisher good morals and common sense never go out of style.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband and he loves it! We saw this in the theater but we knew we had to own this as well and watched it as a family. This is a great movie and we all loved it - ages in our family ranges from 4 years old - 33.
B005P06AAO|5.0|I started watching it in the second season. So I brought the first season to see what happens. I love it.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|This works wonderfully well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" and unfortunately is the only app to get access to Picasa on an HD. I have read the low star opinions and totally disagree, although I cannot gauge customer service as I never had a need to contact them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so interesting even until the end. It had me guessing what would happen until the last page.
B000I186FW|3.0|Natalie always amazing acting.<br />Movie is pretty much predictable, quite dark...<br />I loved &#34;ideas dont die&#34;, Entertaining, but action could be better
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|Bought the album and enjoyed about half of the tracks.  Good music, different type of vocals than most that are out there. Good buy.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every single one of Vince Flynn books and they are awesome. I must have read his books 3 times each and I'm always looking and waiting for the next one to come out.
1451695195|5.0|I saw an interview on Varney & Company (Fox Business) with the author, Dr. Alexander and it sounded interesting.  Read the book in one day and it will change your life.  I feel at peace and comforted, a must read.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|We enjoyed watching this as a family - suspense without gore.  Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly - just wonderful.  Highly recommend watching this again if its been awhile - or for the first time.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|If you're tense while playing like I was at first, then you'll keep losing. This game makes you learn and exercise patience and is a great way to relax after you put the kids to bed. The ambient music ads to the relating effect and I highly recommend it.
B004XJ7HSM|4.0|Pretty good, interesting enough.  Not a lot of action, more storylinec/ plot than anything.  Good date night movie rental or purchase.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love playing, I just wish gems were easier to get. Unfortunately if you want more than 1 a wk you have to buy them and they're too expensive.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I use it on my Nexus 7 tablet and it does the job very well. I highly recommend it to all.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I played this game and got my progress all the way to the hammerhead shark and Guss what?  It forgot all my progress and I had just turned it off for 2 seconds.
1439127700|5.0|I read non-fiction and especially non-fiction political to learn about history.<br />Usually I will learn something new on most every page.  With this book I learn<br />something new in every paragraph.  It is a very enjoyable read as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Words can not express how incredible this book is ;.I couldn't put it down .  As a survivor of abuse this book shook my very soul.  COLLEEN thank u for giving a voice to the voices  in my head and heart.  Hope ,value, self worth and feeling real  are beautifully written .  Will read anything by this author WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's an excellent book! I have read all the books and can't wait for more! Silly Rowley LML! I don't want Christmas break to end!
B0063IH60K|4.0|but way too many ads with the Amazon provided app. I uninstalled and reinstalled from Google Play. Much much better.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|fantastic picture quality both black and white and the colorized version. I don't have a problem with the colorized version like some people. It just gives the movie a different look and I find myself studying the color of the old furniture and other items. They did a great job of restoring this classic film.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|The boos is wel written and it does provide and interesting story, but I did find it very obvious and ended up quite disappointed at the end since I always had the impression the storyline could give so much more. I'd recommend it just as a pass time when you're not in the mood to think much, but at the same time, there are many books more suitable for that.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game it's so addicting ! I can't stop playing this game .. it's a must get game ! :))
B001NLKT60|4.0|An interesting introduction into the remaining vestiges of Swedish angst and guilt.  The Swedes  have been trying to deal with this issue ever since the end of the Thirty Year's War in 1648, and then their complicity with the Nazis in WWII.  This little book addresses all of these issues very well, and the actress who plays the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo does a good job, and has a cute chest as well!.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|Takes too long to reach the landing areas and once there, it's far too hard to land successfully. I'd give it no stars if I could.
0800141660|5.0|The item came just as described.....I just love this movie it's very close to the book which I enjoyed reading on my kindle :)
B003P2WJ6S|5.0|Incredible book! Very well written, captivating and filled with interesting facts. I really like that this book is not only used as journalistic piece but it has a very strong human element to it (the Lacks family and how the fame of Henrietta has affected them). I recommend it for all ages, it truly is a magnificent book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the game. it is fun and a little reminiscent of the original. highly recommended by me. hope you dowmload and enjoy ad well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first time I read the hunger games, it was very hard to read. So much death. And every single time I read through Rue's death, or watch it in the movie, I cry. But this book is so well written, I can't stop the myself from reading it over and over again.
B0026772N8|5.0|This is clearly one of the most influential and thought provoking books I have ever read, I think back  about it whenever I see people doing shoddy  work without regard for the quality of the work or how the sloppiness reflects on them.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|You must listen to Beth's rendition of \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" on this CD and see if you don't agree. Then listen to the track  \\"Something's Got A Hold On Me\\" for the best rock and roll version of this blues song. Buy this CD and all her other CDs !
0761169253|4.0|I read this on the recommendation of an actor/college professor and found it to be inspirational and thought-provoking. It's a fascinating look at the creative process in all of us and it's written in a creative and fun way.  Quick read but awesome.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Can't get enough. missed the series so am watching the Amazon videos... so convenient and affordable. I would recommend this to any Dexter fan.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book because you immediately sympathize with both main characters.  There are so many twists, turns, and surprises.  Loved it, however, I felt the ending was rather anti-climatic... like she just wanted to hurry up and end the story because there wasn't much left to be told.  I loved the closing thought from Nick Dunne.  So on-key.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not one of his best books, but still fun to read.  I actually enjoyed the writing style of this book.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I have never read Murakami before so read 1Q84 with no expectation. I was engrossed from the first moments with a strong character, a hint of the fantastic all layered on what could have been thriller fiction ... But most certainly was not.  Was it overly wrought prose, or perhaps just an odd translation?  Or was it more...<br /><br />It is much more.  Layers of stories intricately woven, with depth of character, plot as a device but also engaging in its own right, allusion, metaphor and all in a fun, bizarre, yet compelling setting (two, actually). It's neither heavy or weighty, nor frilly or sensational. It's a beautifully crafted book that is fun to read, and leaves you wondering many things<br /><br />1Q84 was an unexpected delight, and I am back to buy and read more of Murakami.
1423140591|4.0|This second volume in the new series didn't disappoint. This series has all the fun of the Percy Jackson series but it's older and more mature. The characters grapple with more serious questions of identity, self-worth, duty, and sacrifice. It's good fun with a complete story, new characters that are interesting, and the set-up for the next novel.
0451450523|5.0|It's beautiful and wonderful condition. Person who received loves it. I highly recommend this facsinating and eye catching purchase to anyone.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Love this book and the movie. I think this 2005 version of the movie was very well done and would recommend it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|i cant get the first teeth peice. i cant find the key to open the cabnit. been thrue the guide in game and online. still cant find the key to open the cabnit. please help!!
B005V1WYZC|1.0|I've never looked at my watch so many times praying for the 1:52  to finally arrive!  So painfully dull, formulaic and cliche!  The title say's it al: Crazy - yes the characters are all crazy! Stupid- they fit that criteria as well! And Love-they love to screw one another with lies and deceit!  I've never hated Steve Carell until now.  This shows just how one dimensional of an actor he is. For the love of G_d, what is the talented Julianne Moore doing in this schlock?!  I really can't believe so many people like this... it makes me sad just how pathetic hollywood has become putting out this garbage.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|And left me looking for book 5, still suffering from withdrawal.  This series involve the reader - Martin tells a superb yarn

B007SAKSF2|5.0|British pop group Blur is popular in many countries, but has not had a lot of exposure in the USA.  Damon Albarn is an English musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer who came to prominence as the frontman and primary songwriter of the alternative, pop rock band Blur. However, he has been involved in many other high profile projects, most notably Gorillaz, a virtual band.  Blur is a very versatile band with something to offer for all tastes in music.  Ballads like \\"To the End\\" to more lively music like \\"Colin Zeal\\" and \\"Song 2\\" to songs sung under Gorillaz \\"Feel Good Inc\\".  (This is not a Gorillaz album)  Blur 21: The Box is a steal at the present price.  Even though I bought the CD+DVD remastered collection for my son as a Christmas gift and paid more at that time, I still feel that I got a great deal.  Whether you opt for the CDs or the vinyl you will not be disappointed.    Some examples of their music on YouTube:  [...]  [...]  [...]    More info on the set:  [...]
B00008MJ8H|5.0|I have loved this story for years but recently heard the music being used by an ice skater in an event to gain status for the Olympics and realized that I needed the DVD for my car.

B00846REIS|4.0|Bared you you is wonderful. The plot is engaging, the romance between Eva and Gideon never has a dull moment between the disastrous fights and the intense love making. My only complaint is that there were some things (such as descriptions of people and places) that were continuously repeated throughout the book.
B004SIP8OI|5.0|I love love love love this director. He makes a story come to life like no other. His story telling skills are out of this world. Oh my gosh don't even get me started on his AMAZING dialogue. Kill bill is an instant classic no blue ray collection can ever miss out on. Just too too good.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Wanted entertainment for mobile.<br />App works very good.<br />If you like solitaire this is for you.<br />Yes,recommend to a friend.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I have downloaded probably 400 apps. I've reviewed only a dozen, because I only write reviews for awesomely good apps or horribly bad. If its ho him, I don't bother. This game is excellent. It is unique, engaging, and unlike anything g else I've played. Buy it now.
B00A24CD40|5.0|I Only started watching the first DVD - most enjoyable in terms of quality. Looking forward to viewing the rest of the series.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was great. I have watched the movie many times and finally reading the book has changed my whole perspective of Oz. I like everything about the book except it did not show the land of the North and its color. I would recommend this book to all Oz fans.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It works like a calculator.  Haven't seen any bugs.  Would have liked more functions, but this is perfectly fine for a free app.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|So was a great album 25 years ago when I fisrt heard it and it is even better today. Can't say enough about how good this album is.
B0093IG5KY|5.0|The photos each month are awesome and the daily squares large enough for our family to write in items we need to keep track of.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I have always loved this series and I can't wait for the next book to come out!  The joining of both Greek and Roman forces is awesome.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never would have guessed the ending to this book! I could not put it down! What a great read!
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Gift for a very picky child.  He was very pleased with it.  His father recommended it.  Nothing more to say about it.
B00846F1YW|1.0|Really like this game but only let's u play to 13th level then shuts off would be a good game but it doesn't work everyone should get their money back
B004BSFC46|3.0|They are good, but you can use just for a short period... By 6 M it does not fit confortable.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Great LoL like game. Can play this for hours on end. Controls are a lil touchy, gotta hit the buttons right on or you'll end up running across the screen. Great game all around tho.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Not for those looking for mindless reading. Charlie's story is very complex if you aren't paying Attention to the details.
098478280X|5.0|This book really tells you what interviewers look for beyond just answers to programming questions, advising you on *how* to explain your thinking and formulation of the solutions and clarifying the questions.
B002YCVX5S|3.0|Yeah it was kinda funny but hinged on the abiss i hope the actors can get better gigs in their future
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I just got it yesterday and it is AMAZING! You can edit documents and create your own! You can, for example, write a letter to someone and email it to them, or write a story. It is really cool and awesome. I really recommend this app. And do not listen to any of the other reviews that said this app was bad. I am saying these things honestly. I highly recommend this app to anyone.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|i love it the show is great the package came well packed in box the only think i wish is that the egg you get with the collector edition was bigger but still i have no regrets this thing is awesome
B0081SPK0I|4.0|I'm having flashbacks.  This is fun but it can be just as frustrating as the the original Out Run, if you crash, you will never make it to the finish line.  The game controls work well.  If you liked Out Run, you'll like this game. Enjoy!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I needed to much imagination to understand the main Idea....but the actors where OK...for no rational thinking to achive the goals.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Classic Connelly. Readers will not be disappointed. By far my favorite author. I have read all of his work. It has been a fun ride watching Bosch evolve as a detective and a human. Bring on the next one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter but I play it more than she does. I'm at level 120 and have unlimited coins after getting all the prides several times. Love it.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Its funny, not great and not terrible but funny.  There are worse movies out there and certainly more funny ones.  It will warm your holiday heart.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Good thing it was free! Fast and predictable read. If you have ever been in a narcissistic relationship then you saw all the signs of what would happen. Conner only wanted her when he couldn't have her! If the book were longer and true her would only repeat his prior detached behavior! And she had all the mental thoughts of a woman who was narcissistically abused! Yes I know because I have been there! The chances of a happy ever after....zero!
B00735HGQ6|5.0|Despite all the bad things that had happened in his life, both from his childhood experiences and actions in his adult lie that he deeply regretted, Harold Fry had the courage to throw off all of the past &#34;baggage&#34; and take an enormous risk in starting his &#34;pilgrimage&#34;.  There is an element of surprise throughout the story: each day brings a different experience and a different challenge, so that there is constant suspense as the story progresses.  The Author's description of the many characters and how Harold was able to see through the externals to the core of each person's motivation made this a very morally uplifting story.<br />I have already recommended it to several of my adult friends.
B005LAII1C|4.0|A very funny movie. Mark Wahlberg does a good job in this role. Good New England Accent. Also Flash Gordon is a good addition.
B000YHG72E|3.0|This is a pretty funny movie.  Will Ferrel is a B actor and this is a B movie.  Otherwise its a good way to spend 2 hours of your holiday Off-time.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another solid novel by Flynn. Good story line following some of the real life challenges seen when the US has disengages in the middle east. Some predictable twist and turns as the character Mitch Rapp kills everybody on the other team. Slush funds, Swiss banks, guns with surpressors and crooked politicians at every turn.
0307279189|5.0|An excellent read, recommend this for anyone interested in exploring long distance running, or interested learning more about the Copper Canyon and it's people.
0399226907|5.0|My wonderful daughter is teaching her baby boy to prefer veggies, just like the Hungry Caterpillar, after the caterpillar became ill from consuming fast junk food.

His mom makes him kale-apple-carrot juice smoothies in the morning with just a bit of ginger, and he devours it leaving a big green moustache across his upper lip.  His mom weaned Ethan from breast milk to veggies as his first solid food, with the help of The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  And Ethan, as a result, is all muscle and not an ounce of fat anywhere.  He's one strong toddler.
B002R5QPRI|4.0|I*ts actually not a bad movie.  Its watchable for a guy although a little outdated now.  Its interesting to see Whitney's performance after her tragic death and Kevin Costner is almost always good in any movie he makes.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Great book!!! Didn't put it down till I was done, and because this but was so good that wasn't long I'd say in two hours (restroom breaks)
B008OTTRXU|5.0|The whole family is enjoying this CD.  Carly Rae has lots of catchy tunes that we are all dancing too!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 of Downton Abbey promises to be just as exciting as the last 2.  Although this teaser didn't give anything away on Bates's situation, it's enough to get one enthused about the drama to come.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love this game. I only gave it four stars because if you don' t read  the reviews you don't realize it is not free for the whole game. It is a great game though. If you get stuck looking for the teeth plate in the managers office,flip through the pages of the book on the desk.
0802473156|5.0|Had one for myself and shared it, so I needed to replace my book becuase I did not get it back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing. I couldn't pull myself away from this emotional story where the Mockingjay is a symbol. This deserves an award: you can read it for hours on end, still drawn by the whole thing of how it all ends for Katniss as she plunges into her most inspiring and emotional story yet.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Started out slowly and I almost quit reading - thinking I somehow bought an &#34;English romance novel&#34;.  However, after the murder, I couldn't put it down.  Also, excellent surprise at the end.  Totally unexpected!
B004I2K4DY|3.0|I wasn't impressed by the book, even though it's a classic, so I didn't watch it; I just bought it for someone who's a big fan of it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is very fun I like this app.  great job!!! The games are absolutely free, though you do have to purchase games, get this they are brought with points. Points won from the games and these points needed to get more games aren't hard to collect they are added to your account automatically at the end of your game playing..Great job
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This movie has it all -- a top cast, great acting and a suspense filled plot. It gets better the more I see it.  If you like classic movies and Mt. Rushmore, this one is for you.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a wonderful love story that I have watched over and over. James Garner does a terrific job. A must see for Ryan Gosling fans.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|love to play this game! hours of fun! fun for both me and my daughter who is 10. I would definitely recommend this game.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I steered clear of any reviews before actually reading the book, and I'm so glad I did! I read a few of them after finishing the book, and I just have to say that people who hated the book have obviously never lived 'The Lifestyle'. I'm not talking about a playful spanking now and again, but truly living a BDSM lifestyle.<br /><br />** SPOILERS AHEAD! **<br /><br />I found the BDSM in this book to be just fairly accurate. In fact, I don't think it went far enough. I was disappointed that Christian was so gentle with Ana, and that he didn't take her to her limits. Once, near the end, and she reacted like a petulant brat. But even that I understood, since it wasn't HER desire, and she was absolutely clueless about what 'The Lifestyle' entailed.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes was when Christian used the iPod to eliminate her sense of hearing. That is something I never thought to try before ... but will now! I did wish that scene had taken a darker turn, and that it had lasted much longer, though; that was a bit disappointing.<br /><br />What I really liked about this book were the emotions that were nearly palpable. My heart raced, I laughed, I cried, I could feel the lust, I ached with Ana that she didn't feel the reciprocation of her feelings, and I sympathized with Christian for living behind an emotional wall.<br /><br />The sex scenes were mild, in my opinion, but written well enough that they didn't come across as cheap as a Penthouse letter. Yes, I did get a bit frustrated at some of the childish ways that Ana would describe her anatomy, but then a virgin at 21 probably doesn't have any experience with proper terms, or even slang terms. I would have liked for her to have used something a little more brazen than \\"down there\\" or \\"my sex\\". At the very least, Christian could have used other terms during his dialogue.<br /><br />I also loved the running commentary that Ana had with herself. As someone who does this in my own head all the time, I could relate! I found her naivet&eacute; amusing, her shock at some things downright endearing, and her snark spot-on.<br /><br />The contract was a thing of beauty, and I will probably incorporate parts of it into my own lifestyle. It certainly gave me plenty of ideas, and revealed areas where mine is lacking. And the playroom ... WOW!! I could only dream of a room like that! Actually, I have. And when I win the lottery and can afford to have a house built to my specifications, I'll have an even better playroom than Christian's!<br /><br />The only part that really disturbed me and turned me off was the tampon/bloody sex scene. That's a 'hard limit' for me, and I read through that part as fast as I could.<br /><br />Lastly, the email conversations between Christian and Ana made me think of some of my own online conversations. I, too, tend to be more forthcoming with my thoughts and emotions when typing as opposed to talking face to face. I laughed a good bit at some of the subject lines, and the way Christian would add a little something to some of his signature lines.<br /><br />I look forward to devouring the 2nd book in the series, and hope that the title is accurate; that they delve into BDSM a lot more seriously. I'm looking for play involving candle wax, more toys, harder flogging, and even possibly the introduction of a third party (even though, sadly, Christian doesn't share). I'm also hoping for Christian's emotional walls to come down, for him to allow Ana to touch him, and for him to admit to his true feelings for her.found her naiveté amusing, her shock at some things downright endearing, and her snark spot-on.<br /><br />The contract was a thing of beauty, and I will probably incorporate parts of it into my own lifestyle.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book! What more can I say. The story of taking out Osama bin Laden told by a SEAL who was involved in the mission, amazing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book. Starts out slow but is full of twists and turns, as good as the first. These are my favorite books of all time.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have read the entire Scarpetta series and always find myself not getting anything else done until I finish the latest book. I was definitely not disappointed with The Bone Bed. I once again appreciate the attention to detail and well developed characters.  May be my new favorite in the series.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Installed it on the Kindle Fire HD and it did not work.  Figured it should at least do the basics for a free version.  Very disappointed.  What do you developers do all day - sit around and play tiddly winks?
0345529057|5.0|For the price is very nice books. The paper is low quality, but for the price is just what i need
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This was a fun pack of games, but you must pass one game to unlock the next. Some were easy, others were harder.  Thankfully there are a handful of games already unlocked that will aid you in unlocking the next set of games, but it was still challenging.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is fantastic! Each level brings new challenges, obstacles, and characters. The game gets harder as you pass each level as well. Along with beating each level, you find pages, which tell a story. The story continues with each page you find. Each level also has puzzle pieces to find. I cant wait to find them all!  Definitely a game in which you need to use your brain. MOST definitely a five star rating from me!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|i love the pics thanks for the book its AWSOME! woohoo! whoever has made this book has experience in these books so i think this guy should get an reward for est book experience ever YEAH!
B009Z8HCR2|4.0|&#34;Diamond Eyes&#34; saw the Deftones really step up their songwriting to a whole new level.  This new album is almost as good as that album!
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I remember this game on the console....this is very addictive and has a few different game modes for challenging game time.  I loved it there and I really love it here, on a nice, portable device.
B002GJU54E|5.0|I have read this book four or five times. It's just so funny. The monkey is hilarious along with Stephanie's grandma and Lula. Carl the monkey, priceless.<br /><br />Edited for typos. Sorry about that.
B008476HBM|1.0|I was very very disappointed when I downloaded this book for my Kindle. According to Amazon customer service, there is no way to tell if any of the free Kindle editions of books are abridged before you download them. In this case, the book is clearly abridged, and it is a very poorly done abridgment. Hopefully, the paid versions of this book for Kindle are not abridged.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This guide is easy to understand and should prove useful.  I have not had time to set anything up as I'm still writing.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This program is a more advanced version of App Killer.  It's a must have for any tablet.  This should be something that comes with standard.  It helps to show where all your memory is going and cuts it to the quick.  It's also useful for applications that are acting up, like Song Pop tends to do from time to time, bouncing between advertisement and list.  This will take care of the problem, no fuss, no muss.  Highly recommended.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie. It was just as good as the first two! Didn't even notice the length (it didn't seem too long-even though it was nearly 3 hours).
B006BDHAX0|3.0|Nice variety of set-ups but graphics are just mediocre.  I would like bolder, more vibrant graphics so I may be searching for a different Mahjong game.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I don't want to spend real money on fake stuff just to keep playing.<br />Awesome graphics and lots to do in this game tho.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This is a match three plus game that challenges you to clear the screen before you run out of bubbles.  Proceeding to do so in the proper order can mean the difference between level complete and level failed.  Good, challenging fun.
B005PK553C|5.0|One of the best tv shows I have seen in years!  Every twist and turn was shocking and left you wondering what will happen next.  There was not a dull moment.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I am on to book #2 and the pacing and action improve greatly.  This book was ok. Bit too incredible too often and the too much filler as if we cared about plausibility and tricky sleuthing.  Needed to be read to start the series
B009JBZH54|4.0|If your going to own this, it better be in Blu-ray. The quality is worth it. I like the extra bonus features it comes with.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game was fun but it's a lot of work to keep up on your village.  I played this extensively when I first got it.  Then I had to do a reset on my Kindle and lost all my progress.  I just haven't got the heart to start over yet.  But I will.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case is awesome,  pretty and functional, even the packaging was impressive.  I read reviews of some problems people had with this case but I liked it nevertheless.  The case is already showing signs of wear after 2 weeks but should last at least as long as any other case.
0385344228|5.0|This book has it all, fantastic plot, many surprises and brilliantly written. There are very few books that hook you on page one and when that happens, you know you are onto something wonderful, something that will make you want to read into the early hours of the morning or if you wake in the night, sneak a few chapters in... that is exactly what happened to me with Defending Jacob.<br /><br />I don't often read courtroom books/thrillers but this has certainly wet my appetite for this genre.<br /><br />Written in a narrated format from the Fathers perspective telling you all about that frightful day when the world changed for his family. I particularly loved the court transcript parts that gives you a hint of what is to come. I very much warmed to the Father and liked his character very much, you really get to understand him.<br /><br />I need to be careful what I write as I certainly do not want to give anything away, I will just tell you there is so much more to this book than you will first expect and right to the final word on the final page it will grip you .. you have my word!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Spellbinding to the very end. Impossible to even attempt to guess how the story will pan out. Highly recommend. A++
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app lets you get down to a system level on your tablet...something that I think should be standard on all devices!  In my opinion, this isn't an optional app, it's a requirement.  I have recommended this to everyone using tablets.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has helped me know how long I can read a book or play Temple Run! It helps me manage my time and plan out how I need to work with my kindle fire.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I am tough on watches and this one is a very rugged and is holding up well and the bonus is that there are no batteries to mess with
B0076DELIG|3.0|I did enjoy the book, but did not think it is as good as his previous Harry Bosch books.<br />not quite as unputdownable as usual!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This app works exactly as it should.  I was able to check my Twitter account for any updates straight from my tablet.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|DVD would not have sound half way through.  Then when we tried to restart it,there was no sound at all.  Had to reorder another one from a different seller.
B009JBZH54|5.0|FANTASTIC SET<br />WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY.. IT'S BATMAN!!!!<br />AWESOME ON BLU RAY<br />AWESOME SOUND<br />AWESOME BATMAN!  Just get it! You will be happy you did!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The app is a great app for the Kindle Fire HD.. Just wished the Kindle Fire would have came with the rear facing camera as well. Its as good as it can be with a front facing camera feature.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Bought these as an alternate to another set of headphones I'd worn out that went around the back of the neck. Price was great and they sound fine. I do prefer the around the neck style for what I use them for but the price couldn't be resisted. I'd recommend these.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Beautifully written. It had me rushing to turn every page and had a very interesting twist at the end that you knew could have gone many different ways, but wanted to see the route Nicholas went with it.
B00003CXDD|4.0|This movie brings me to my childhood. This DVD is a good movie that shows the influence of Tolkien on Lucas.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read everything Nelson DeMille has written, but this was not the best.  I read the best of the best in spy thrillers and this one was too slow, some parts were not quite believably written.  I will be in line to read his next because of past books.
B009DB60W4|5.0|Had to write a review for \\"Les Fleurs du Mal\\" because I was disappointed to see it had the same Amazon 4-star rating as their previous release, the wholly bland and formulaic \\"Sitra Ahra\\".<br />\\"Les Fleurs\\" is the first symphonic metal album I've heard in a long time that actually sounded fresh to me.  I'm not necessarily the kind of person who puts novelty before anything else when it comes to music, but I appreciate when artists make the effort to step outside their usual formula.  This album retains a very Therion sound, but it's built around these smoky French chansons in a way that's entirely different from the rest of their discography.  I would say \\"Les Fleurs\\" satisfies my need for spooky symphonic metal, while also doing something refreshingly new with the genre.<br />My favorite tracks would have to be \\"Mon Amour, Mon Ami\\" and \\"La Maritza\\".  I can't stop listening to those two.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I rented this movie for my son, but realized that I really liked it; I just may have to buy this one
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The series is very entertaining. Every member of my family and most of my friends are reading this series or watching it. Take a look.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I read some John Grisham and I liked this one because it was well written and kept your interest to the end. Entertaining beach read.
1454701250|4.0|I'm not sure when I ended making stamps, it's been awhile.  This is a reminder and bringing back why I did it in the first place.
B0084TWN9K|2.0|I read the prior reviews and thought I would give this book a try. The stories are short and easy to follow, but I found the stories quite sad.  I felt bad for the characters to the point that I didn't enjoy the book.  I stopped reading it.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Shawn is a very engaging and enlighted author. The book is easy to read and full of practical suggestions to educate the readers on how to recognize happiness.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I read all of Vince Flynn and this lived up to expectations. Can't wait till the next one.  Would Reccommend
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Once I got into the groove of this book, I had a hard time putting it down (which was about page 10 haha). Loved the characters, they way it was written, the plot, everything. This is my first 500+ page non required reading I've finished.... Great choice. Great job, Hugh Howey.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It's a really good book. But a little too long winded in the middle. Great beginning and great ending, way too drawn out in the center.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I love this show all the actors are great hope it never ends.  I would recommend this show to everyone.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I already have a love of Tim Burton movies and this one didn't disappoint. I enjoy the color symbolism and role caricature that he employs throughout the entire movie. If you enjoy Tim Burton films this is a great addition.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game i have loved since i first bought the beta on pc.. then on xbox.. now its great that its on the kindle fire because i can take it almost anywhere.. the game lacks in the size of maps and no caves.. needs some updates<br />Highly Recommended!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good end to the hunger games series, poetic, poignant, yet allowing for truth in reality of feelings and thought. Well written and mesmerising.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, IT IS TOTALLY ADDICTIVE. IT IS A GREAT WAY TO KILL TIME WHILE WAITING. YOU CAN TURN OFF THE SOUND AND NOT INVADE ANYONES SPACE
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I enjoyed all three of the movies and the quickness that they came in. No glaring issues with the change from VHS/DVD to blu-ray.
B0034G4OZE|3.0|I thought this movie was alright, nothing spectacular. Honestly, I was hoping much more. If your thinking about purchasing it, think it over. It's not expensive, but I've had it for months now and have only watched it once. Something you watch once in a blue moon.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Never thought a puzzle game on a computer could be as much fun as playing with actual peices....  Even had my mother try it out with me.
B005GSVFAK|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY NEPHEW AND HE WAS SIMPLY AMAZED OF THE WAYS THAT YOU GOT WATCH THIS AMAZING DVD.  I COULDN'T BELIEVE I SURPRIZED A TEENAGER.
1594487154|5.0|Dan Pink has a knack for providing provocative books about the changing world of work, and in this case, changing the way we look at the art and science of sales. Pink breaks it all down superbly in this new masterpiece.<br /><br />Since Amazon doesn't have the Table of Contents, here's a look at what's inside:<br /><br />A. REBIRTH OF A SALESMAN<br /><br />1. We're All in Sales Now - Some 1 in 9 workers still earn a living in traditional sales. The other 8 in 9 are engaged in \\"non-sales selling.\\" We devote upward of 40 percent of our time on the job to moving others.<br /><br />2. Entrepreneurship, Elasticity, and Ed-Med - Elasticity in job roles ensures a lot of non-sales selling. The fastest growing industries are educational services and health care (ie. Ed-Med.) Jobs in these areas are all about moving people.<br /><br />3. From Caveat Emptor to Caveat Venditor - We've moved from a world of caveat emptor (buyer beware) to one of caveat venditor (seller beware)-- where honesty, fairness, and transparency are often the only viable path.<br /><br />B.  HOW TO BE<br /><br />4. Attunement - Bringing oneself into harmony with individuals, groups, and context. Illustrates the three rules of attunement and why extraverts rarely make the best salespeople.<br /><br />5. Buoyancy - Learn from life insurance salespeople and the world's premier social scientists what to do before, during, and after your sales encounters.<br /><br />6. Clarity - The capacity to make sense of murky situations. One of the most effective ways of moving others is to uncover challenges they may not know they have.<br /><br />C.  WHAT TO DO<br /><br />7. Pitch - The six successors of the elevator pitch and how and when to deploy them.<br /><br />8. Improvise - Understanding the rules of improv theater deepens your persuasive power.<br /><br />9. Serve - Essential principles for meaning in sales: Make it personal and purposeful.<br /><br />Again, Pink serves up a great new book for business readersand I strongly recommend it. Another new one in this genre that I really liked was [[ASIN:0974320692 Leadership 2.0]]
0345803485|4.0|A woman's book!  A Fantasy!  Lots of sex if you like tat sort of thing!  It's Just a fun book
0876391277|4.0|I purchased this item for a friend, who plays the Sax. I didn't know there are different types of saxophones (and she prefers playing tenor), so this book was perfect...as it's suitable for all saxophones. The book came late, but when it arrived I was pleased.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|Sure this was not as good as 1982 &#34;Thing&#34;, but it was still good.<br />I remember seeing the 82' &#34;Thing&#34; in theaters and watching people walk-out as they found it too over-the-top. And in all fairness it was not a Great film, but the effects were Fantastic and it built tension.<br />This one has good effects for CGI and still manages some nice tension.<br />Overall I enjoyed it.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|this movie made me paranoid. i shouldn't have bought this and shouldn't have watcheded it. cuz it made me throw all my stuff away and run away from home.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie was very entertaining . The take away is that you can't be selfish and you must think of how you actions can hurt others.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My grandson played it for hours! Couldn't use my own Kindle Fire because he just couldn't stop playing.  Great purchase.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I told my wife that I couldn't believe we missed it in the theater.... it was such a good movie!!
B008WCP2PG|1.0|it had bad sound, it was bad grafic... i returned it!<br />i was really dissapointed about it<br />good movie thou
B0006J28L4|5.0|Recently, I purchased this DVD.  I hadn't seen it in over 20 years.  I had forgot how long it was as well...however, as I watched it; the message and power of Malcolm X's words were the utmost profound and I find them extremely necessary and relevant today.<br /><br />In this so called, \\"post-racial\\" era (clearing throat), race has become that little something that no one really wants to talk about any longer, fueled by the second term re-election of the nation's first African American President, Barack Obama.  However, race is very much a reality today as it was in the 60's.<br /><br />After watching the movie, I took the time to review the documentary on the second disc and it was very powerful.<br /><br />I first read the Autobiography well over 23 years ago, and after reading it; my soul and my intellect opened up.  The book had a powerful impact on my psyche and when I went to see the movie in 1992; I was transfixed by Denzel Washington's performance.<br /><br />Spike Lee should have won for best director that year; but the passion he had in doing the movie is self-evident--even after all of these years.<br /><br />I highly recommend everyone to get this DVD and show it to your children/grandchildren.<br /><br />This is very important history and must be given the respect it deserves by our culture.<br /><br />America lost one of its brightest hopes in February, 1965, but Malcolm X (El Haj El Malik Shabbaz) still lives on in our hearts and he will never be forgotten.
B008F9VCC8|4.0|This was a gift for the holidays. The receipient dived right into the batch. It's great because the third book was not yet available State-side before January at the latest.<br />Packaged excellent shape when received.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story is beautifully written. Stein will trigger every emotion you have. Reading it was my vacation from the real world.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love it! I love that I get to use my own creations throughout the game. AND it isnt one of those boring pointless games where you draw your stickman &amp; then jump over some stuff.  Its actually kinda challenging. I mostly struggle when Im unaware of everything I can do. Like making a longer wick for my bomb so I dont blow up with it. I didnt know it would let me do something like that until I got stuck at that part &amp; had to look at the hint. This is the kind of game that I spend alot time going back to make sure I did everything I could. Including burning stuff down that didnt need to be burned &amp; electrocuting zombies. Nice. Highly recommend. I got it for free but now that I know how good it is I can say its worth paying for.
B001NI24OI|5.0|This movie get me going every time. I love it from the bottom of my heart, if you play football, not any of that BS where it is all about winning, but where it is about the brotherhood that you build with your teammates, the value and respect you gain for your team as a whole, then this movie will mean the world to you. Even if none of the above is true for you, this movie still goes down as one of the greatest sports movies of all time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This clock has an easy to read display and I like the default alarm sound. Easy to use. Wish there were more clock faces (a nixie clock would be great) and sounds but this is very reasonable for a free app. I like how this app doesn't run down your battery overnight.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was funny but to much profane language. Children could not look at this. It would be much more likeable if much cleaner.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|As stated previously by others, the news feed only shows a little of the feed, which is find for me, I only have a few friends. For me, he problem is that I don't get notifications, which caused me to miss an old friend coming in from out of town. I am not pleased.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It is wonderful having such an easy access to this dictionary.  It is fast and easy to use. A great tool to have!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm not usually a hard sci-fi fan.  This was just enough inside my understanding of science to make it enjoyable and where as sometimes (I admit it) I skip through technical aspects of books, these I read right on through. I was worried that the book might get too dreary or angst heavy.  It did not. The main character HAD to be interesting and appealing and he was.<br />Yes, there is cursing. It did phase me for a moment then I realized I'd be cursing, too.  It is not curse laced.  It is sprinkled.<br />I read this in one sitting and enjoyed myself.  I knew I was really into it when I -HAD- to tell my husband what a character just said. (and then explain the rest of the book so it was in context)<br /><br />Nice job, Mr. Weir.

I love collecting official hardback game guides for games I've played/playing so this is sweet. I can't say I see anything wrong with it to discourage anyone from buying it, and the fact that it's a collector's edition I guess only sweetens the deal.

B001GCUNYO|4.0|It's not a complex, deep emotional thought-provoking action movie, but it does deliver exactly what it promises: Liam Neeson throat-chopping a ton of sleazy bad guys.  I wouldn't have taken Liam Neeson to be quite the action hero, but he's really good.  Pun slightly intended.

B008W31IFS|3.0|Michael Connelly is a clever writer and he knows how to spin out a story, but this time you can't ignore the feeling that in constructing the plot for The Reversal he has added too much to the mix and lost touch with reality in the process.  What might make for an intriguing debate at a dinner party, just doesn't hang together as a credible courtroom drama.  Heller shifts from the defence to the prosecution, the crime occurred 24 years earlier and the accused is being retried having successfully overturned the original conviction only the jury can't be told. There are just too many hurdles for either the characters or the reader to navigate satisfactorily.  This one is for die hard Heller and Bosch fans.

B005LAII8A|3.0|Time travel done well can blow minds, warp brains, and have people leaving the theater wondering what happened as they try and wrap their heads around it all. This is no such film. Many of the more interesting aspects of the film are never explored at all. Loopholes are all over. I can see here that this film is well liked and that worries me. Take away the guns, the flash, the grit and just look at the story and there is not much here. Making a film with an unpredictable ending is easy. Making a time travel film with a great unpredictable ending is hard. I'm not going to go into details and spoil this for anyone but this film was a letdown for me. I had a much more interesting scenario matalizing in my head as I watched it play out. I expected my idea would be trumped by a fantastic mind blowing ending way bett than anything I could conceptualize. Nope. Turns out it was just some lame....Oh, OK, so that's how it ends. Huh? Well at least it had some decent action. That this is being touted as some brilliant time travel film is bothersome. Its not brilliant or profound in any way. Somewhere in Time, Timecrimes, Back to the Future, 12 Monkeys, Time Bandits, even Timerider are all way better and more thought out than this. And the TK stuff lifted from Akira was nonsense. The film did no even need it. I suspect it might have been added to glitz up the simple story. Episodes of X-Files and Star Trek have better time travel episodes. 3 stars for keeping me interested but ultimately letting me way down.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|What an exciting story. I was impressed by the special effects. They look so real that you sometimes wonder if it is fiction or reality. Great movie. Is it the beginning of the Aliens saga with Sigourney Weaver?

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is a great film. I loved it. One of the years best. This BR/DVD cover poster is the worst. It looks like 1000 other lame BR/DVD covers. Cant they use the cooler poster from the film. Why cant they do that? Why? Criterion makes cool non lame covers, why cant the studios? Why does everything have to look the same. this looks like I could have snapped a photo of Ben Affleck and in under one minute thrown some red type over it, added a crowd shot and split it in 3 and this is what you'd get. This poster does not communicate the nature of this film at all. LAME. MAKE BETTER POSTERS FOR DVD AND BLURAYS!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I chose this rating for the simple fact that this is Hollywood at it's finest.  I am definately a David Fincher fan.  The David fincher sequel was terrible due to its non existent script.  Also the CGI alien was a first and pretty lame.  The whole &#34;from the alien&#34; perspective was the best part about the movie.  This was like a helmet camera attatched to the head of the alien.  The underwater scene was amazing as well.  I just was really bummed about the lousy Fincher sequel.  Very pre-fight clubby dark wet and grimey.  This whole box set is amazing though!  This set is built for true film fanatics and aspiring film career enthusiasts!  Worth every penny!  Sigourney acted and looked Just like an alien when she ressurected!  Her acting is triumphant.  I wish she would make out with me one day.  How many times can you end a movie the same way though?  Come on Hollywood....enough with the alien sneaking back on the spaceship at the end of all four films.  I see it happening in Alien V also.  Spend the money, just know this thing is like a dictionary on your shelf.  Four unique directors for one believable encounter.

B009O07NDY|2.0|There is some brilliant music here, but I'm going to blame a good deal of what is wrong with the first Hobbit movie on this soundtrack. For me, the problem with the film is tone and tenor - it wants to be LOTR but it is not, nor should it be. Some dark, heavy moments are all that should have been needed to create a consistent tapestry with the other trilogy. Instead, we have an overly serious movie that lacks the fun of the book.<br /><br />Unexpected Journey wrestles with tone. For me, the jokes fell flat. Some were even grotesque, such as when SPOILER the great goblin is killed. Does anyone in this movie ever smile?<br /><br />In the book, the whimsical tone is set by the narrator. Without a narrator, what sets the tone for the film?  In large part, the soundtrack.  Sorry no whimsy here.  That the movie chose not to be whimsical is a reasonable choice. But the soundtrack is really joyless, isn't it?  After three listens to the double set, trying to like it, my conclusion is firming up.  Good music, but ill-conceived.  The liner notes tell how Shore decided upon an operatic style. Opera?<br /><br />The Rivendell theme is mostly adapted from LOTR, and thus has an ominous tone to it. Where is the thrill Bilbo felt at seeing it, meeting the elves? Not in the music. The whole scene played under a misplaced context to me, because of the tone.<br /><br />I love MISTY MOUNTAINS, though the production is a bit out of whack with the rest of the recordings. And it would be nice to have a version with complete lyrics from the book, instead of this aborted rendition. Likewise, BLUNT THE KNIVES sounds lifted from the on-set recording; while this gives it a more spontaneous feel, it isn't very well recorded.<br /><br />It's all doom and gloom here, and I miss the spontaneous sense of adventure that drew Bilbo into the story. The wonderful reworking of MISTY MOUNTAINS into the hero theme does accomplish this, but in that, it is pretty much alone.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|The subsequent DvD is remarkable.  The director and Cinematography are stellar.  Tweedy is obviously happy and optimistic due to falling in love and getting married.  He deserves all the happiness he can get.  The Dvd is so simple and perfect.  I fell asleep watching it at one thirty am on new years morn, drunk on chateau nuf du pop and Millesime Champagne.  It is a peaceful film to put you to sleep for the start of an epic new year.  When I woke up at seven a.m. on my lazy boy I thought to myself, &#34; I'm gonna shake it off!&#34;.  The guitar solos you would think are a bit too much for almost every song but this sonic genius deserves a solo in every Wilco song as long as he chooses to remain in Wilco. Led Zeppelin was allowed infinite solos and so should this guitar giant.  The best thing to happen to Wilco other than Jeff was this tall musical guitar hero.  I look forward to hearing his solos or slides.  I love seeing Jeff Happy.  This album and dvd are very important for any Wilco fan, any film maker and any Wilco virgins.  I listen to this album every time I eat supper with my woman.  She always says &#34;Your on a Wilco kick, huh?&#34;  The album makes me believe in bands again.  The album makes me believe in love again.  Production is tight.  Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan love this album I am sure of.  Jimmy page is definitely enjoying the solos on the DvD.  Thanks for making real honest music guys!

0142418471|3.0|I really enjoyed reading John Green books and Every Day by David Levithan, so I decided to pick up Will Grayson, Will Grayson. I had previously picked up Will Grayson but there was too many derogatory words for me to enjoy. Now after reading Will Grayson, I realize using derogatory words were necessary to create an authentic and realistic feel to the book.<br /><br />Most Young Adult readers are familiar with John Green books. They all follow an addicting formula where a nice, geeky, and awkward guy meets an amazing girl who changes the guy's life. Will Grayson, Will Grayson was a very atypical John Green novel as it is told from alternating perspectives. It is told from the point of view of two teens named Will Grayson.<br /><br />John Green's Will Grayson is attracted to a smart, and charismatic girl named Jane. Will Grayson is just your average John Green nerdy guy that reminded me of myself. Nerdy Will is friends with Tiny who is homosexual and very large. Tiny was definitely one of my favorite characters in the book due to his interesting personality. The other Will Grayson is homosexual and he has manic depression. At first I liked Nerdy Will better than Depressed Will but soon I began to prefer Depressed Will's chapters. The Will Graysons meet at a very unexpected place and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Frankly Will Grayson was a very entertaining read but it didn't live up to the expectations his previous books established. Nerdy Will wasn't just as interesting as Depressed Will or Tiny. Depressed Will's sense of humor was one of the best parts of Will Grayson, Will Grayson. I particularly enjoyed his rant on \\"LOL\\" and other texting jargon. Also I did enjoy the IM conversations between Depressed Will were really interesting to read I have read a couple reviews of Will Grayson, Will Grayson and many of them are bashing the musical finale. I do admit that it was a bit predictable but it was definitely entertaining.<br /><br />Will Grayson, Will Grayson wasn't my favorite John Green book (that honor goes to Looking For Alaska). In my opinion this wasn't as emotional as Green's other books such as TFIOS or Looking For Alaska and that was a downside in my opinion. I really enjoyed David Levithan's character with his twisted sense of humor.<br /><br />This was also my first GLBTQ book and in my opinion Will Grayson did a great job dealing with sensitive topics such as \\"coming out of the closet\\". Another aspect that I enjoyed was how all the homosexual characters weren't your typical homosexual characters.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend Will Grayson, Will Grayson and I can't wait to read more of David Levithan's novels. If you're looking for another contemporary novel to read I would definitely recommend reading Will Grayson, Will Grayson, any John Green title and Every Day by David Levithan. The only books I have read by Levithan are this book and Every Day but I know I will read more of his books soon.favorite John Green book (that honor goes to Looking For Alaska).

0061726834|2.0|Imagine a world where love is a disease called Amor Deliria Nervosa and the goverment has developed a cure for all 18 year olds. Lena is not too far away from getting the operation but then she gets the disease and everything goes haywire. Delirium is one of those books that it seems everyone had read except for me. I picked up Delirium because I wanted to see what all the buzz was about. I can see why Delirium is such a favorite in the YA community because it has action, adventure, and romance. Unfortunately I wasn't a big fan of Delirium due to it's slow pace, and basically because Delirium wasn't anything special.<br /><br />Delirium brings nothing new to the Dystopian genre. We have a female character named Lena who slowly realizes how corrupt society is until she rebels. Alex is her damaged and sensitive love interest who loves to read poetry to Lena. Both Lena and Alex were characters I have seen countless times before. I really didn't like how Lena needed Alex to save her and I wanted to see more of a bad-ass female protagonist.<br /><br />The setting of Delirium really isn't much of a setting at all because there is literally nothing special about Portland. You would think that a dystopia would take place in some horrible and twisted place but then you would be wrong. Portland is a place where love is outlawed, genders are segregated and all of those under 18 have a curfew. When people reach 18 they are cured (as I mentioned above) and they no longer have a curfew. Also people are no longer the same after the operation personality wise. Something I have been wondering is: Why did people just accept this? How did society transforms into this dystopian society? Curing love wouldn't solve any of the world's problems in my opinion and I really had no understanding of the society. Lauren Oliver doesn't give the reader an inkling about how society changed or agreed on such a matter. Outside the city there is the Wild where Invalids (outlaws who oppose the cure and the gov't). Doesn't this sound vaguely familiar?? That's because Delirium \\"borrows\\" much of the setting and plot from The Uglies by Scott Westerfield. In The Uglies people get an operation who changes people's personalities and outside the city is the Smoke where people who oppose the goverment live. The difference between Uglyville and Portland is that The Uglies gave you a fundamental and interesting backstory and knowledge about how society was formed. I feel like Lauren Oliver could have done so much with Portland but instead she created a very \\"bland\\" setting.<br /><br />Like other reviewers before me mentioned, Delirium suffers from an extremely slow plot. Slowly Lena realizes how terrible the government is with the help of Alex. The problem is that not much action happens in the book until the last 3rd (last 100 or so pages). The rest of this book is just romance upon romance scenes. I can read a book with only romance but it annoyed me how superficial it was at first. Instantly as soon as Alex and Lena met, they fell in love. The romance aspect of the book wasn't bad but I do prefer lots of action-packed scenes to accompany my romantic scenes. I really felt like Delirium really lacked emotional depth until the final scenes of the book.<br /><br />Does Delirium deserve the hype? I probably would love this book if I hadn't read so many dystopias with similar plots before. Everything in Delirium was so generic including the setting, characters, plot, and romance. Delirium took way too long to get into and there wasn't much conflict until the final pages or so. I am not sure if I will read Pandemonium but I hope Pandemonium has more action and adventure. Atleast there was no love triangle in Delirium because I am seriously tired of love triangles. Delirium was a decent read which I recommend for fans of Uglies and Matched.the gov't).

B008YWY0HK|4.0|Rebellious Scottish princes Merida, a teenager pressured to choose a future husband so her parents can arrange the marriage, instead argues with her mother and runs away to prove her independence (it's really nice, in a Pixar/Disney film, to see a princess not waiting around for a man to marry or rescue her!).  In the forest, mystical will-o-the-wisps (who Merida has been brought up believing can lead one to his or her destiny) lead the princess to the modest home of a wacky witch, who provides Merida with a spell that will change her mother, the queen, into seeing her side.  The spell changes the queen all right, but goes horribly wrong, and from her on the story is one about mothers and daughters, bravery and loyalty, and a message about finding one's own destiny within.  Beautifully done, beautiful to watch, and another winner from Pixar.

145210655X|4.0|I was perusing the Goodreads Choice Awards nominees when I came up on Darth Vader and Son. I am not a hardcore Star Wars fanboy but I do really love the Star Wars universe. I knew once I set eyes on this book that I would love it and so I requested it from the library. Once I came home I devoured it in minutes and Darth Vader and Son was pretty mindblowing.<br /><br />Darth Vader and Son is a funny graphic novel that shows Darth Vader raising 4 year old Luke Skywalker. It isn't funny that you will laugh out loud for hours straight but it will make you chuckle and smile alot. If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll really appreciate this slim but sweet story. Even if you're not a Star Wars fan, I think you will without a doubt enjoy this book. I really can't wait for the new Star Wars movies and Jeffrey Brown made me even more excited.

1476704163|4.0|My Crazy Beautiful Life by Ke$ha is a book that I found on of my trips to BAM (Books-A-Million). I enjoy listening to Ke$ha's feel-good catchy pop songs so I figured I would read it. I got it at my library and read the entire book during a half hour car ride. My Crazy Beautiful Life really had a ton of humor and it was a very entertaining read.<br /><br />We learn of Ke$ha's roots with being born at a party, getting accepted into Ivy Leagues like Columbia, dropping out of High School, and sneaking to Prince's house in just few pages. I was surprised but My Crazy Beautiful life was filled with tons of awesome quotes such as: \\"This is my dream. This is the only thing that I have been put on Earth to do and this is just the beginning.\\"<br /><br />This isn't exactly sophisticated Shakespearean text but it's definitely alot more fun to read. I particularly loved this little anecdote about glitter (for those of you who don't know Ke$ha is a glitter fanatic). When talking about glitter Ke$ha remarked: \\"It's like marking your territory. And if I get lost you can just follow the trail of glitter to me.....My assistant told me: 'Sometimes I think I have dandruff, but then I realize it's glitter'.\\"<br /><br />Besides all of Ke$ha's fun stories about concerts and making music, My Crazy Beautiful Life explores serious topics too. Ke$ha addresses bullying and how she was bullied for being different and an individual. \\"I know how it feels to be bullied; I know it can stay with you for a long time. But I always had a dream and a determined mind.\\" Ke$ha overcame all of her haters and bullies and she didn't let them change who she is. If Ke$ha let those haters dictate and change who she is, Ke$ha wouldn't be the record-selling hit she is. Ke$ha also talks about how important family is to her and about her relationship with her mom.<br /><br />Basically My Crazy Beautiful Life was a fun light read that was entertaining. It's not entirely a light read because Ke$ha does explore some serious controversial topics. The pictures in this book are pretty cool and had a nice touch to Ke$ha's memoir. If you're a Ke$ha fan or not you'll definitely have a blast reading this memoir of Ke$ha's life so far. I wish Ke$ha all the best luck for the future but I don't think she needs it. This review took longer to write than the reading of this book.rious controversial topics. The pictures in this book are pretty cool and had a nice touch to Ke$ha's memoir.

B002LLE3PY|5.0|Review of `Lizard' 40th Anniversary CD plus MLP Lossless 5.1 & DTS digital surround DVD package.<br /><br />***<br /><br />`Lizard' was released in December 1970, King Crimson's 3rd album & a radical departure in style from their previous recordings. It has a very jazz feel and makes liberal use of classical orchestral instrumentation & musical structures. It sold less well than almost all KC's other albums up to 1980, and is often seen as an oddity. However `Lizard' contains some stand-out pieces, and still sounds fresh after 40 years.<br /><br />Gordon Haskell (who made a brief appearance on `Poseidon' singing `Cadence & Cascade') joined the band as full-time bass player/vocalist. Haskell's voice is neither strong nor distinctive, but does a workmanlike job. Andy McCulloch plays drums with a precise & understated soft-jazz style, one of the defining characteristics of the album. Mel Collins again plays woodwind & sax, with Bob Fripp on guitars & Peter Sinfield on VCS synthesizer. Jazz pianist Keith Tippett (who started playing on the band's studio sessions at the beginning of 1970 & contributed to `Cat Food' on `Poseidon') again makes an outstanding contribution; Fripp unfortunately failed to persuade him to join the band full-time. Brass/woodwind players Nick Evans, Robin Miller & Mark Charig act as session musicians to help create the album's unique sound. The outstanding cameo is from Jon Anderson, vocalist & founder-ember of `Yes', who Fripp persuaded to sing `Prince Rupert Awakes' which opens the long `Lizard' suite.<br /><br />The original album:<br /><br />`Cirkus' opens the album, a classic mellotron-dominated Crimson track a la ItCotCK with Sinfield on top lyrical form describing a circus in full swing - with sinister undertones. A pair of light-hearted jazzy tracks `Indoor Games' & `Happy Family' (describing the then-contemporary break-up of the Beatles with the fab four given pseudonyms) follow, then the short `Lady of the Dancing water' with some fine flute work.<br /><br />The stand-out track of the album is the `Lizard' suite which took up the whole second side of the original vinyl release. Jon Anderson sings the opening piece `Prince Rupert Awakes' over a simple piano accompaniment, the song then opening out into one of KC's `big sound' numbers with choral backing. The theme continues in the same key with `Bolero' where the brass players & Tippett take over and stretch-out the piece into a long, fine jazz improvisation, to return finally to the main theme. The suite continues with a battle scene orchestrated in a classical-style (i.e. like Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture) & its aftermath `Prince Rupert's Lament' with Fripp producing some long, sustained wailing guitar over a slow bass line, and a closer `Big Top' which returns to the `Cirkus' theme.<br /><br />The 40th Anniversary offering:<br /><br />Like other KC releases in this series you get a CD plus audio-only DVD presented in a gatefold sleeve decorated with the distinctive original album cover artwork, images of the album's content presented in the visual style of the Lindisfarne Gospels. A 16-page colour booklet with the song lyrics and story behind the music, written by Bob Fripp and Crimson biographer Sid Smith, completes the package. Fripp mentions that Steven Wilson has `redeemed' the music of `Lizard' and restored it to its original glory.<br /><br />The DVD is once again the star, with the music offered in MLP Lossless 5.1 surround, DTS 5.1 digital surround, MLP Lossless stereo, PCM stereo 2.0, plus the 30th anniversary remaster of the original 1970 stereo mix. The DVD graphics are easy-on-the-eye, the menu simple to navigate, the sound fabulous. The bonus material includes an alternate version of `Lady of the Dancing Water', an excellent `Bolero' & studio run-thru of `Cirkus'.<br /><br />Fripp and Wilson have again done an excellent job in resurrecting this fine and unusual music. `Lizard' is a true oddity and proof that KC were never afraid to experiment, combine different styles & produce something unique & special. This is easily the best version we're likely to see, so buying it should be a no-brainer.xperiment, combine different styles & produce something unique & special. This is easily the best version we're likely to see, so buying it should be a no-brainer.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters, and I felt that it would be the perfect gift to my five-year-old niece.  The movie is an animated, updated version of &#34;Annie&#34;; you come to care about the girls as much as the main character, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) does; and in the process, you find that at heart, Gru is not as &#34;despicable&#34; as he seems.  He, too, is looking for love and acceptance, but like so many who've been rejected, he hides behind a gruff, tough exterior.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie will keep Jon Heder relevant in the back of pop culture's mind simply from people remembering him as &#34;that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite&#34;
B00000J2KX|5.0|I really like horror movies and Jack Nicholson so I doubled my pleasure with this movie. LOL  It showed up on time and I enjoyed it that same evening.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome!!! The only word to describe this book.... I am so in love with Holder and Sky. If only I had someone to love me that much, thank you Colleen Hoover for writing this book!!!!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|The movie had a good story line and brought tears to my eyes laughing so much....but man at the language...
B0006GVJEE|5.0|LOOKS GOOD JUST GOT HERE TODAY. ITS A B-DAY GIFT HOPE MY GOING TO BE 23 YR OLD LIKES IT.<br /><br />HE JUST LOVES TARANTINO MOVIES
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Second book was the best out of all three, totally worth reading.  I just wasn't that fascinated to keep reading the third one after the first two.
B008J34466|5.0|All i have to say is PINK ROCKS!!! I love this album. When i need a pick-up this is what i listen to.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Little else has excited me this year as much as the release of Tom Hooper's adaptation of `Les Miserables' has.  My all-time favorite stage musical, this musical is so near and dear to my heart and the talent involved in this particular adaptation had me so antsy with excitement.  A few days before the release of the film, the soundtrack was dropped on us and I snatched it up rather quickly.  Outside of a few sporadic clips I'd seen on the internet, I was walking into this blind, which I think is the best way to go about something like this.<br /><br />The first thing to note here is that this is a `highlights' album and does NOT contain all the tracks from the film.  Sadly, this is a misstep.  I'm sure they'll eventually release the soundtrack in its entirety to see if they can spike record sales and make a few extra dollars out of their customers, since I will be buying it despite already having half the album.  While this does note that it is the highlights album, it is missing some key tracks and scales down some others so that they don't feel complete and I feel like these highlights are a skeletal few.  I mean, where is `Lovely Ladies' or `A Little Fall of Rain'?  Why is `At the End Of the Day' stripped so bare?  They really had a chance to make this something so special and while some of the key tracks are here in their entire splendor, it is sad that this album is so incomplete.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that Hooper's take on this source material was far more earthy and emotional than one may expect, and that reads in the vocals.  This is NOT a concert version of tracks, so please expect to hear the sucking of snot and the cracking of voices as Hugh Jackman, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks and especially Anne Hathaway sob their way through their big numbers.  In the context of the film, these versions work brilliantly, for you can feel the depth of pain and sorrow that accompany these songs, but as a straight album for your listening pleasure, it doesn't always work.  Without the visual accompaniment, this can be a bit overwhelming.  Trying to sit back and enjoy the music on its own is hard when the vocals are not always `pretty'.<br /><br />Still, the big numbers are sold gloriously.<br /><br />`I Dreamed a Dream', `On My Own' and `Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' are the best here and really shine through even without the visual presentation of the film.  Russell Crowe has been attacked for his lack of vocal chops, but he has a pleasant tone to his presentation and handles the verses of his songs beautifully.  He cannot hit the bigger notes, and it suffers most on the album because this is where we want to hear perfection.  In the context of the film itself one doesn't notice as much his vocal limits, but here there is no buffer.<br /><br />`Bring Him Home' is the only true misfire.  Sadly, Jackman butchers the song.<br /><br />So, I loved the movie and I really like this album as a whole, but it is incomplete and the earthier take on the songs themselves don't always work in an album format.  They are tailor-made for the realism of the motion picture and fail to sustain that impressive nature on the album.esn't always work.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|got it as a gift for my son on his b-day coming up. i hope he likes it, he just loves tarentino movies
B009AHWLHE|4.0|I've seen some complaints from die-hard &#34;fanboys&#34; of the game franchise, but I enjoyed this movie a lot and I've played most of the games. Enough action, great animation, and lots of classic, slightly out-of-place one-liners from Leon that we've grown to love. My sister enjoyed it too even though she's less familiar with the games' storylines. Some slow and overly dramatic parts, but worth it overall, especially for the bigger fighting scenes. Decent voice-acting, despite the forced accents. Even if you are too distracted by the CG to pay close attention to the story, it's still easy enough to follow, and the characters are the important part of the story anyway. I preferred this film to the previous one, Degeneration.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I found evernote to be the best app so far for keeping my writings memories and events in when I'm on the go. I can video or take snap shots all while typing away on my device. I don't find many apps that capture my full attention but this one blew me away. Thanks
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I haven't played it but I have watched my kids play.  They love it!  My 8 year old figured out how to play it easily and it keeps a 14 year old entertained.  Great game.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Well, not only strategy, but a little luck is needed, too.  My teenager can't get enough of this game.  This is the game he requests when we want family time.
0679805273|5.0|I love the way this book doesn't gloss over the hard times one will have in life.  A realistic message for children given in a fun way that is easy for them to grasp and they understand a bit more with every reading.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great movie!  One of the best movies that I have seen in quite a while.  Reminds me of a modern day On Golden Pond.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Whenever I have time to kill, this is what I play.  At first it is very easy.  Then it slowly becomes challenging.  My kids even play it!
B009YU9J0E|4.0|I love this band! From this band's first album I've been hooked!  I can't get enough of their unique sound!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|wonderfully done movie with an important message to give children about our environment and the precious trust it is that has been given to us for safe keeping.  All other messages included are also important - like thinking about others and considering the impact of your actions.
B0015DROBO|5.0|having seen only the american version film of this book, which i very much enjoyed, i find the book is much more detailed,<br />and involves many stories.....as opposed to only the primary one of the film.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|great time waster, one of my favorite android games right now, but once i beat it i wont have a reason so pick it up again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was told by several friends to give watching The Walking Dead a chance. I resisted checking the show out, not wanting to see just another cheesy, gory zombie show. I was hooked by episode three in season one and don't have cable currently so watched the first two seasons on Netflix before going to Amazon for my season three fix sooner than waiting for Netflix. The show has great dynamics and drama between characters which makes it interesting and gives pauses/breaks to the intense zombie and action scenes. The action scenes, btw are great as well coming from someone not usually into that sort of thing. Plus the show makes you think and appreciate more of the day to day things we take for granted (like clean water, warm showers, not being eaten, etc)! It also causes you to think about how you would handle the situations the characters are put into, and is much more stimulating in that respect than many shows that I have recently seen. I am excited to see season 4, and highly recommend giving this show a chance. A word of caution though, you may end up more addicted than you would suppose!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this is fun I got up to a high level the first day I got it!:) does anyone know haw to beat the level where you have to beat stickenstein and rescue your friend? cause I tried and I cant beat it! I love this app!:)
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat throughout!  The character playing the detective didn't stray far from the character he portrays in Boardwalk Empire..crazy!
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I love the classic sci-fi movie, and own the dvd but when I saw this package I've had to have it for my collection.<br />Very fast service, will purchase from seller again..
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Usually I don't bother buying an entire cd, because there are only a few good songs to jam out to and the rest are ho-hum. This cd keeps my interest and is enjoyable to listen to from start to finish. I enjoy both the beat/sound and lyrics to the songs in the album, and it is one of my favorite &#34;stuck in traffic/driving&#34; albums.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|There is enough action to keep five year olds entertained and it moves enough to keep adults from getting bored.
1609613937|5.0|This book is incredible. It's full of nutrition advice to help save your life, and your sanity as you try to eat healthfully, but eat satisfying foods so you don't end up feeling deprived. I recommend it for anyone who seriously wants to get healthy and avoid cancer, heart disease, diabetes and all the other typical American diseases. I love potatoes!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is well made and fits the Kindle fire perfectly.  It proteacts the Kindle well and would not hesitate to purchase another one.
B008J05EL8|1.0|This DOES NOT WORK! Like other reviewers have written, this as a waste of money. The $4.99 that I spent should be refunded.  So should everyone else's! It does not work!!! I am very disappointed! :(  Don't WASTE your money on this! I want a refund!!!
0547569653|4.0|I'm not a vegan and not looking to be one in the future, but this has a lot of good info.
0800141660|5.0|Need I say more? Elanor's reaction when Edward tells her he's not married is So Good! Definitely one of the best movie moments in history.
B00A993UWM|1.0|I would not recommend this garbage to anyone. This is total crap. If you have seen a real picture of Kesha, you know that the photo on the cover is heavily photoshopped.
034580404X|5.0|These 3 books are not something I would I normally read but I must say I really enjoyed them. I have already loaned them out!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very challenging but also fun, I'm totally addicted!!! In a good way of course. Everyone should get this app
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I can hardly put the book down. I have been up too late reading and am so anxiou to find out what happens. The characters are well developed and very interesting. I highly recommend this book
B0001US62I|5.0|angel heart: excellent service from this company, thanks a lot and happy new year to you all--over and out the end.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|Watched on New Year's day.  A bit violent, but the ending is victorious and very satisfying.  All in all a great movies to enjoy with older friends & family members
B006O7XOOW|1.0|At less than one yr old this toy is useless. The can not concentrate on where balls go. It is loud, and eruption is boring
1451648537|5.0|This is one of the finest books I have ever read. This is a long book but I found it interesting all the way through. A fascinating individual and after reading this book I am in awe of what he, Apple and Pixar accomplished. Given that, the passages about his family and personal life were maybe the most interesting. A powerful, emotional read, for me.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plays well, but needs a better way to quit the game when there are no more plays to be made
B005IQZB14|5.0|Great book so far! I am so in love with this story! Cheryl Strayed portrays herself so raw and real in this book and I can relate to everything she is going through
B0063IH60K|5.0|Best game ever! I love it sooooooooooo much!!!! The only thing that bugs me is the ads but, I still love it!!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Always a good movie, especially when shown full length as this version is, but the best are the surprizes in the commentary where the director and cast members provide information on many different scenes and answer some questions that have always been nagging in my mind, like, where did they find a ski slope to go sledding in Chicagoland?  And who's picture is that on the People magazine that Clark carefully positions for the camera in the bedroom scene.  This is the version I've been waiting for!
B009G78EE2|5.0|It's great when you find something different in the genre and The Heist is definitely that. All of the songs, but especially Thrift Shop and Wing$, do a great job presenting their story, melody and lyrics in a cohesive manner that really sucks you in and keeps you hooked. Totally worth picking up if you are bored with the same old lyrics over the same old beats day in and day out.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I bought this film as a gift for my younger brother for Christmas; Amazon shipping meant the item arrived exactly on time and the quality and contents were exactly as advertised.  Say what you will about the film itself, the quality of the picture, sound, and bonus content was outstanding.<br /><br />Everyone should note that the film switches between two different aspect ratios, one for standard film (letterbox) and another for the IMAX scenes (Full screen on an HDTV) on the BluRay only; the DVD maintains a letterbox format the entire film.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|This movie was predictable and not engaging.  The love story was weak and not realistic.  In the end, the good guy's win, blah blah blah.
B000M341QE|5.0|If you haven't seen this one, you're missing out.  It's one of those that will have you jumping form your seat at the end asking &#34;what just happened?!&#34;
1451690215|5.0|It's the first science book your kid should read.  It deals with the scientific method -- how do scientists think, and how do they reach the conclusions that they reach?  Once your kid understands that science is not magic, that scientists arrive at conclusions for reasons based on logical methodologies, he/she will be well prepared for learning more in depth about whatever else he/she may choose.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|I gave this as a gift for Christmas. It came as expected and worked perfectly. Thanks for your on line service sure saves the hair pulling mall trips!
B008N1V11U|5.0|It's awesome even though it takes up 2 GB it is so worth it.But  sometimes you might want to delete it
0394818237|5.0|Such a clever creation that your child or grandchild can leaf through for quick enjoyment, but even more intriguing once the child begins to discover the tiny but intricate hidden charaters, items, and detail.  Perfect for parent/child, or grandparent/grandchild time, and will provide years of fond memories.
0143120530|4.0|This book won't teach you the techniques of the memory palace.  What it is is the story of Joshua Foer's attempt to go from regular schmo to memory champ in the course of one year.  It's entertaining and well written, and it may inspire you to go for it yourself!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I have watched this actor since before he was messing up in his life.  He has become one of my favorite actors with movies like Natural Born Killers, Iron Man and many others.  great movie to put into my large collection.  Thanks.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Great CD! Glad they are still around and making fun music for us! We enjoy all of the songs on this one.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|I gifted this set to my family members, and everyone loved it! I love the addition of the soundtrack and the book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is really good and I like the format of it! Definitely want to see the movie now! This book opens your eyes and teaches a lesson. I recommend it for anyone especially peope in high school.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|My hubby has wanted this movie since the first time he saw it and I was able to purchase it at a very reasonable price and was able to put this movie into our collection of more than 450 movies from the 60's - now.  Love it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Being an avid reader of both sci-fi and apocalypse themed books this one (Wool omnibus 1-5) seemed perfect for me. And wow! It is well written with great characters, emotional depth and an extremely intelligent story, which you start to appreciate even more especially after reading the books \\"first shift\\" and \\"second shift\\" (book 6 and 7 of the series).<br /><br />After reading this I bought all his other books to my Kindle and read them as well, many of which were also very good.<br /><br />Thank you Hugh Howey for this amazing ride and I look forward to more of your books!
0061733199|5.0|Provides common sense reminders and new tips in applicable, bite-size chunks of information for just about any situation.  At first glance through I learned several ways to get water, poisonous plats to avoid, build shelter and a latrine!<br /><br />My dad came to visit for three days and had is nose in this book the whole time!
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I loved the movie about Sugarman and that is why I bought the CD.  Find myself singing this all the time.  Sorry it<br />took so long to find him.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The movie had a similar following to Ultimatum but it was a great movie, Jeremy Renner is a great actor but I would like to see a movie with Bourne and Cross in it!
1423140605|5.0|Arrived just on time and in perfect condition.  Well packaged and just as described.  I got it for my Son who is in 5th grade and is a Percy Jackson fanatic!<br />Thanks
B0085YNML2|5.0|Munch Time is a super fun game with a cute chameleon who really likes grubs. New levels provide fun and different obstacles.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Blu-Ray...found no technical errors.<br />Movie...great ending to trilogy. Cool how it ties the other movies together.<br />Reality...glad that it dealt with the damage that the Joker had done while in the midst of dealing with Bane.<br />Good story...betrayal hurts!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|Movie was really good and quality was superb! I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who likes action movies!
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Ordered for a gift for someone.  I was pleased with my purchase and it made a for a very nice gift.
B007WPLZAK|1.0|The film itself is fine but I looked at the rating Amazon had listed as TV-PG and assumed that meant it was farely innocent in terms of what you see BUT about an hour in it has very explicit content. I'll be double-checking from now on
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|It was an ok read. Pretty predictable with lots of drama.  Seemed like it was more the teen crowd.  Kind of reminded me of an 80's TV movie of the week.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|These movies have it all, action, comedy,drama. They have some really funny parts in them. Love all four movies. Can't beat the price.
B000066744|5.0|Enjoyed the movie very much.  One of those movies that you would want to see again and again.  I have watched it three times and intend to see it again at a later date.  Enjoyed it from beginning to end.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched it on Roku. It was excellent, just the last 20mins of the final episode kept shutting off, so I watched it on iTunes.
B002M9WW30|5.0|having this entire movie collection on blu-ray for $20 was a steal! And the receipient of the gift was just as ecstatic!
B00AOB5I1Q|5.0|This was one of my favorites as a kid And it's still good! Kinda different for Disney in my opinion. Most Disney movies are all cutesy and family friendly. This one isn't like that too much. It's real science fiction mostly. Anyone can enjoy this!
B000A5044C|3.0|Despite the astonishing realism that Hirokazu manages to capture in this 140 minute documentary-esqu film about how four siblings would cope without their parents, he somehow neglects to create any emotional bond between the characters and the viewer.<br />Neglecting to filter out unnecessary sequences between, what should be, heart-wrenching moments and yet still managing to spread the story over a full year was a bold move which doesn't seem to have paid off as well as it should have. Boldly introducing characters for 2 minute scenes, only to never be seen again; unlikely interactions with neighbours and the odd rain-man-type reaction from characters are just a few gripes I had with this film.<br />These things aside, the slow but obvious disorder that appears as the film progresses is where all the emotion seems to lie. The gravel-like crayon stubs which were full Crayola just 2 scenes earlier, the noticeable growth in hair and the lack of food which further-diminishes every time the fridge is opened; just a few of the many minor details which hold this film together.<br />Stunningly filmed over several seasons and constructed in a manner which doesn't make it immediately obvious which season you're watching, this film definitely has the beauty that it deserves, but maybe this subject matter needs more than beauty to hold together the story of a mismatched group of kids fighting for survival, It needs love... or a lack there of.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Amazing amazing amazing<br /><br />A great show worth watching. I guess my patience has paid off. Did I mention that this show is amazing?<br />I am not going to write a lengthy review, seeing that there is already a 1000 reviews for Game of Thrones.<br />I definitely recommend this series. I loved Lord of the Rings a lot of and it kind of reminds me of LOTR.<br /><br />Yes, there are a lot of characters and it may be hard to follow but do not let that discourage you. Re watch the episodes again or have discussions with your friends or some people that have read or are reading the novel and that will definitely help shed some insight if you are feeling confused and over whelmed with the many characters.<br /><br />10/10.<br /><br />Series exceeded my expectations!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My brothers,sisters they've begged to play this app.I have to say the person that put the other review,I have to agree with them.this is the best since the first one!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|it is awesome thank you Mr.developer it some times is hard to keep up with all my teamlava apps it keeps me entertained for hour loads of fun
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book and a real page turner. Love the storyline and appreciate the fact that I don't have to hide this book because of content or words.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|To play you must build from parts and maybe it will do the trick!  It challenges you to built the perfect ride for the piggies which is really fun to do!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|my little brothers and sisters just beg me everyday to play angry birds and they won't leave me alone until they do.I even enjoy this app my self.I highly recommend this app if you have the original angry birds!!
1476719071|5.0|I love this book and even though I have the Ebook I just had to have to signed hard copy of it too :) Love it!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This was a really great movie... I am so hoping that there will be a sequel with Robin!! He made the movie.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a great game and good idea.  It's definitely an interesting concept and I am showing it off to everyone I know.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app.it is the best one ever I really think that most people should get it.it has very few ads,it is very amusing.I say you should get it!!!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This was great especially for school! I just wish they had a search box so I could go straight to the word and not have flip throughout Ghana the pages. By  overall great dictionary.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very strange.  I was extremely disappointed in it and I can't say I understood the point.  Would like to discuss it with another reader.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I loved to receive this only a few days after it came out, after pre-ordering it. There was one problem and that is that when I got it the discs were loose in the box, and there was a tear on the outer packaging. But the discs work fine, and the box itself was fine, so I guess I'm happy with it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I recommend this book to all those people who love adventure mixed with mystery,romance,edge of it seat action, and yearning for characters wants and sometimes unwanted needs<br />I personally LOVE THIS FREKING SERIES so much I.... um....Well<br />Want to kill some freaking evil butt and go all satyr on their butts--er if they have any? Ooooor their heads waters getz za hop done eh?<br />But seriously amazing books and the content is very nice for all ages above like 3-6 (unless u can read super well...-or not it all depends)
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Great book, exactly as I remember from reading as a child. I would recommend this read for anyage group. Great classroom read.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|I can very much relate but cannot help but think he was on a suicide mission, seems so sad to just waste and end up that way ;0
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It was exactly the copy i wanted! The only thing I found confusing was the music download. You have to go to some external website, download the music file to your computer THEN upload it to iTunes. But the digital download of the movie is directly through iTunes. The movie is perfect!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a great book. Although Charlie could be frustrating at times, I loved watching him learn and develop. He is very honest and good and vulnerable I am happy he had Sam and Patrick there for him. I barely put the book down finished it in under two dayzz.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is so fun and I love how it works on my kindle. I will say if you like\love this game I would recommend you to get it.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Fun take on holiday classics, beautiful harmonies. My 13-year old asked for it, so we purchased it... but the whole family is loving it!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not wait to find out what happened next!! It was more exciting than the first book was to read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love this game. Very challenging at the same time it's not. You have to try it out. Just wish you didn't have to pay to play all of the game.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|Video keep freezing hard time watching as it would freeze many times during movie wasn't worth the 3.99 I paid to rent it
B008ALA6DW|5.0|This is an official Apple accessory (at least when purchased from Amazon.com). It feels sturdy, looks nice and does the one thing it's supposed to do. It's maybe a little expensive for what it does, but it's pocketchange after my ~$4,000 MBPR.<br /><br />At first, I was turned off by having to use these adapters with the Thunderbolt ports, but now I rather like it. It gives me the tools I need when I need them, but gives me a thinner computer when I don't. The right tool for the right job without always carrying the whole toolbox.<br /><br />A must for large file transfers over the network!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book but it left me wanting to read more about the exciting love between this young couple.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|As yet another vampire-sploitation flick, it's probably decent, if that's what you're into.  The production values are high.  As  a film related to Lincoln & his times, it does make a few interesting parallels, but in total they last about 5 minutes.  It's anti-slavery flavoring is nice, if minimal, but the rest of the film is ludicrous (Lincoln practicing Kung-Fu-like moves with his axe) in both plot and action, and, of course, violent and gory. The guy who plays Lincoln must have had too much botox before the shoot, as his expression never changes.  2 stars is generous.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Matthew Bomer as the lead criminal in White Collar definitely carries the season into incredible crime solving. With some humor and danger the season is exciting and attention grabbing. White Collar crime has never been so exciting.
B000002A3T|5.0|This was always among my favorite Pink Floyd albums, despite the fact that Roger Waters called it garbage from start to finish. At least David Gilmour is not still touring a 40 year old album. This is CLASSIC Floyd!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I enjoyed the originality of this movie, which is why I rated it as 4 stars. It would have received 5 stars had it omitted the excessive profanity and nudity.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I really enjoyed the action scenes in this movie and the potential the plot had, but it just raised too many unanswered questions, I won't list them here to avoid the spoilers.  I would have given it five stars had the story been more tightly wound.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|The first season of Teen Wolf is exciting and humorous as the characters enter into a world they didn't believe existed. There is danger, love, and a surprise twist that you won't see coming, not to mention a shirtless montage in the special features. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone that loves werewolves or want to get a few laughs mixed in with the danger. Also, this series is not affiliated with the original eighties movie with the same title and follows a completely different story line.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app gave it a 4. Would have giving it a 5 if able to use app in portrait or landscape mode.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't seem to put this down now! My husband showed it to my 9-year-old niece, and she's a natural. We had four devices going in the room, with everyone engrossed in Flow Free. Try it!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I purchased a used 2009 Infiniti G37 with the Navigation option.  The ipod cord that was in the center console was already there, but it was for 30 pin versions of ipods and iPhones 4s or older.  I bought the lightning pig tail to convert the 30 pin to my iPhone5. I was able to plug in my iPhone5 and play my music, but I wasn't able to charge my phone at the same time.<br /><br />With the Cable Jive dock stubz charge converter it made it possible to charge my iPhone while it was playing music.  You will need this device if you have an iPhone5 while using an older 30 pin cord that came with your Infiniti car.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Pleasantly surprised by this little gem of a movie. Justin Timberlake turns in a great performance while Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood are simply stellar as a daughter/father duo. A must-see for any baseball fan or anyone from the South. Yet another great movie to come out of Georgia's newly incentivized and re-energized film industry. John Goodman also holds his own in a perfectly cast supporting role as the Braves' scouting director.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It's awesome, not exactly the ending I expected. The only let down is knowing that there isn't another book to follow.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a fun challenge for anyone who loves puzzles that exercise your spatial awareness! Lots and lots of free puzzles at many levels of difficulty!
B00APUYN0I|3.0|I had heard that this was a movie that you'd like if you were a fan of Glee. After checking in on Get Glue while watching, I read a comment that one episode of Glee is better than this movie. It got sloooow in the middle but ended strong. Anna Kendrick is a star.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has surpassed himself, this book pulled me through like a vacuum tube.  I read this in the fastest time ever, which is a shame because I didn't want it to end.  The title \\"The Last Man\\" is a tribute from the books main adversary about our hero \\"Mitch Rapp\\", stating that he is the \\"Last Man\\" left in a soft bureaucracy who will chase down and eliminate the \\"bad guys\\".  He is also the \\"Last Man\\" that anyone would want to tangle with.  Mitch is still relentless in his attitude and desire to cut through the \\"BS\\" and deal with problems head on, and shows how effective this strategy is against schemers and plotters, he is older and more involved in the CIA bureaucracy than before, as his profile is more visible the more enemies he collects, both in Washington and abroad.  This book demonstrates the mortality of everyone, whether you are the toughest or the weakest, with both Stan and Mitch facing death in very intimate but different ways.  I enjoyed every aspect of this story, it deals with current attitudes and the political correctness that prevails in the US today, it is nice to be reminded that there are still people around that can push through the nonsense to get the job done.  Many thanks Vince Flynn, I hope another novel is being forged as we speak and will be released \\"soon\\".
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|A classic story that everyone should read. The ending was a bit short and I would've liked a better wrap up to the whole thing. But this was much better than the whole movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was so good I finished it in only 9 days I just couldn't stop reading it!!! My reading has improved very much!!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Pretty good movie. I liked the cast, but the story could have been better. Also I couldn't get over how bad Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Make up was.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|i'm a big Star Wars fan & this is just a fun!  The main characters as Birds are just funny!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was  so good I read it twice! The romance was so realistic and very in depth it made me connect well with Abby and it had many cliffhangers that constantly led  me in suspense waiting for the next solution. I enjoyed the ending as well as it left me with a feeling of completeness entirely that pulled the story together. I am defiantly looking for walking disaster coming out to hear travis's side of the story an  learn further about him as a character! Five stars!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Awesome television show with hours of laughter.  This was a Christmas gift for my twenty-something son and he LOVED ti!.  We've watched over and over.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app and it's FREE.  Use it on all my devices with complete ease and reliability!  Love the radar, extended outlook and the emergency alerts.<br />Precisely what I needed for my weather info needs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game. It has yet to get boring, there seems to always be a new challenge. Highly recommend
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I think everybody should have a chance to read this book it is the best book I have ever read I mean the best. I recommend  this book for all ages,well if you can read of course
B0053O89WY|5.0|A Christmas gift for my son who was thrilled!  The DVD arrived quickly and as described.  We are a soft kitty family and appreciate the great deal on this item through Amaazon.  Wowuld buy from this seller again.
B0090EIC3Y|3.0|It was so something to watch, what can I say? It was humor in its crudest form. Make sure the kiddies are asleep!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Thank you for the product. My roommate loves this show, so this was a christmas present to her. I hope you have a great new year!
B0083ZBW2Y|1.0|I would not recommend this book. It was very confusing an didn't make a lot of sense. I gave the book one star.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Great Backpack. Lots of room. I have a 17 inch laptop and it fits perfectly. Lofts of pocket and padding. Straps are strong and well made. Doesn't seem to get dirty quick either. I took a bit of time looking for a reasonably priced back pack and this one was the  best I found. To get anything similar or better you'd have to spend a lot more.
B0018OFN4U|4.0|A zombie lovers must have film. I hope a sequel comes out one day. Serves as a good comical base plan for the next zombie apocalypse.
B000KEG94C|5.0|Thank you for the product. This is one of my favorite movie musicals and I could have sworn I had a copy, but I did not, so I indulged and bought it. It was quickly shipped to my house in great condition. Have a great new year!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy would make your heart stop, Even bring you to your knees but then again there are much worse games to play. Katniss Everdeen the Mockingjay. Peeta Mellark and Katniss Everdeen May you live FOREVER in these words.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|This book was exciting and a very original idea but the plot line was a bit predictable and the descriptions a bit redundant. Still I would recommend this book to anyone who just wants a simple easy read because the story is still fun to experience.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A must see for walker lovers. A few sad spoilers, however the heartbeat pumpers are still in effect. I'm ready for more braaaaains!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My grandchildren ask for my Kindle when they are visiting. (ages 4-9) I downloaded Angry Birds Star Wars for them before Christmas as a &#34;treat&#34; for them. They were pleasantly surprised, as were their fathers.
B001HVZO9S|4.0|Arrogant drummer learns about being part of a team. Great drumming, choreography, and acting all around. Impressive school band face-offs, with great cinematography.
B009VLX8FS|1.0|This CD has turned to totally pop and is barely supporting the country music genre. This CD is easily suitable for college radio and alternative genre labeling. What happened to the Banjitar player I knew. Yes it show versatility, but when you make a recording, you should vary the music keys, rhythms and tempos as to differentiate each song from the next and previous. Remember that REO Speedwagon CD \\"High Infidelity\\" It did the same thing, But that CD was also very successful for the short term. Perhaps the new listeners are hearing this in a Shuffle Mix with other artists as opposed to an end-to-end listening in order.
B006GLM5EQ|3.0|I was hoping for more, but I'd still give more episodes a try, but only if they were free unfortunately.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book was wonderfully creative and took me into a world of imagination that I immensely enjoyed. I can't wait to read the next book.
1400052181|3.0|This was required reading as a book club choice. It's actually a pretty good introduction to medical research in the fields of serology and immunization technology. There is interest in the applications of Lacks's unique long lived and quick multiplying cancer cells. The book covers beneficial results of the cells in development of serum for testing polio vaccine and other applications. It also shows the contamination of other results from lack of control of HeLa cell multiplication. A couple of other instances of unique cell applications and commercial exploitation are shown. There is further interest in the ethics of patient rights to their own body parts and DNA characteristics along with related legislation and legal cases. It's also interesting that a second try to harvest long lived cells failed. That doesn't lead Skloot to speculate that HeLa cells might be characteristic of the tumor as much as about Lacks herself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the interesting parts are buried in an overlong human interest story about largely ignorant and obnoxious people that I never could care about. With information about Lacks herself sparse, Skloot attempts to evoking interest in her family and progeny. Of course, medical value, commercial value and legal rights don't depend don't depend on character appeal. I found more interest in Skloot's depiction of her own research than any appeal of Lacks family character analysis or history.<br /><br />If Skloot has read a fraction of the references contained in her ending notes, she knows much more than the book shows. It's too bad that a potentially fine writer of popular medical science has to resort to specious human interest to sell a book. This is well written and readable. If we discard the throw away sections, it's a very interesting and informative half of a book.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|The email part seemss to work well, but the description indicates you can see your hotmail calendar, but you can't.  That is the main reason I installed the app.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Nothing to not like about this book.  Not sure what the differences were between this version and the newer version--didn't notice there was the &#34;post-movie&#34; version out till I had purchased this book, so cannot compare.  Maybe it is simply the photos?  (none in this book, which is fine with me).<br />Read the entire book in one day on my Kindle--which was the first book onthe new Kindle and the first book I have read in two years (two kids under 5, work full time and live on a farm, so just busy--not lack of desire!).
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed the movie. It is a very interesting plot and the acting is very good
0375703764|5.0|decided to share the love I have for this book with a friend - I ran across this one years ago at a vacation resort's lending library and I was hooked.<br />It is an intricate story that you must read carefully - perhaps more than once
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I haven't used this app a lot, but it seems to work very well. I would recommemd I would recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!  Not too stressful, but defn works your brain.  My 5 year old also loves it, so cannot go wrong.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|This anniversary set has it all: videos, cds, booklets and vinyl! It's Rage in their original album. The cd of their original stuff that they sold in concerts before they made it is worth the price of the whole set. It is raw and beautiful-like Rage's music has always been. This is a must have for any Rage(Zapatistas!) fan.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|read the book, see the movie.  so worth the time investment.  very gripping in terms of human focus and our lives with animals
B007PTJOV0|5.0|app is awesome closest thing to Mario. app is very addictive not had it very long so not sure how many levels there are but I hope its a lot
B008RTJQDI|5.0|What is it with siblings?  The Andrews Sisters, The Roches, the Everly Brothers... They blend so effortlessly that the resulting sound reaches a critical mass that explodes beyond the parts. These two, relatively new and inexperienced, sing with great power and confidence.  There is none of the annoying affectations you usually hear in young voices, like whining, anguished yowling, too much vibrato at the end of every long note, auto-tuning.  Instead, the voices are mature and self-assured.  I could hear no auto-tuning or any of that sort of processing.  Their previous album, The Big Black and the Blue, is also excellent.  My only caveat is, if you are a fan, don't buy the Lion's Roar non-box version because it has fewer tracks than the boxed version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a wonderful book the book just kept u pulled in and you become so attached to the characters, I couldn't put it down.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I am a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory.  I had to get the latest season on DVD.  I always get an extra copy as I wear my copy out.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|I first read this book after borrowing it from a roommate nearly 10 years ago.  I am a chronic re-reader and this book (and the rest of the series, for that matter) is a must-have for me.  Becky Bloomwood (the Shopaholic) is just your average girl with a shopping addiction.  Of course, there are catastrophes and flat-out mistakes with this character and her actions, but I think that it adds to her charm.  She grows from her experiences (mostly) and learns from her mistakes (for the most part).  Most of all, the tales are just FUN!  Becky is not a perfect person (and neither is anyone else), some of her ideas are a little hare-brained, and her friends and family are overwhelmingly forgiving.  However, I enjoy going along for the ride. :)
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Camera works fine and you can instantly upload to facebook. Wish kindle would have created the camera to take pictures of other people. You can only take pictures of yourself. Bummer but not the apps fault. Amazon should fix.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|super fun and addictive. the . only reason it is not a five is some of the tiles don't look the same but are still a match
B004132HZS|5.0|Love this series - so smartly written.  If you are a fan of Sherlock this series is for you.  Updated but yet still classic.
0679809015|5.0|I was worried this book would get overlooked in the stack of books the child has already because it is so tiny.  Turns out her Mom said she loves it and insists on it being read to her over and over.  Plus baby who is just 10 months can manipulate the pages herself because it is so tiny. Book has lots of pages for a board book and a flap on each page and nice artwork.  Drawback, it is printed in China.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|The Kokkia i10s works perfectly for my everyday gym needs with my iPod. I use them with a pair of Jaybird Sports and have had no issues. It is definitely the smallest Bluetooth adapter I have seen.
1591396190|3.0|Book was ok,  A lot of rehashed and reworked ideas. I guess there really isn't anything new under the sun.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|One of the best National Lampoon's movies.  Something about the stress during the holidays and watching this movie takes it away.
B007XIC1GI|1.0|I could not even force myself to finish this book.  I like some of his music and am fascinated by his video's, but just couldn't stomach the book.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Matthew McConaughey and Gina Gershon must have done this only for the money.  Are they that desperate?  The movie-if you can call it that-has no redeeming social values.  I guess the people that liked it are heavy into sadism,violence and brutality.  I just saw Tracy Letts in New York in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. He is an amazing actor.  I hope he will stick to acting and not write anymore of these awful stories.
B003UESJF6|5.0|LOVE this movie. Same with my kids. It shipped quickly, new in wrapping, no scratches, great quality. I've had issues a couple of other times with some sellers sending me movies that looked pirated, but NOT this one!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Ok I admit it - just like everyone else I got hooked on this series.  I hate the fact that we are behind the original broadcast in the UK but it is worth the wait.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft moved to mobile platforms could have been disastrous but instead it was done well. with extremely fun online play and enjoyable and relaxing creative mode.
0689853637|5.0|This book is nothing short of amazing. I have added it to our traditional Christmas eve story time to everyone's great delight. The pop ups are breathtaking. Could not be more pleased with this book and Robert Saturdays other pop up holiday offerings.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I have read other Seal Team books and they were better in my opinion.  The author was careful not say what he was not supposed to say and considering the nature of the events this book described it was just an OK read.  if you really want to hear about the details, skip to the action parts of the book where the raid begins.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Huge fan - I always buy extra copies because I want to watch the show whenever I want and I wear my DVDs out.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|The plot and humor are geared toward pre-teens.  Anyone older than 10 will be bored pretty quickly.  Don't waste your time.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|very interesting game. I love any hidden object game. The story line is pretty good. Wish there was more mini games.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|This is not only for the lovers of Baseball but a great family movie as well!!  It teaches what a parent can teach their kids when it comes to the parents passion.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Love this series - so smartly written.  If you are a fan of Sherlock this series is for you.  Updated but yet still classic.
B005Z28M58|1.0|the last disc in this set does not play and several other of the discs have parts that won&#34;t play including one that only plays half of the disc. very disappointed
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome game but needs buckets able to mine red stone also add spawn eggs and and needs flint and steel in creative love this game you need to buy it.it is very fun

B000YMM3CC|5.0|The movie is great! I was very surprised that I really liked it. This movie is a classic that everyone should take the time to see
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great story told at a great pace. You will not be disappointed by the series, my only hope is the series has a good ending.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this app on my iPod and iPhone. It's the best weather app, as far as I'm concerned. Love it.
B00000JG41|5.0|This, in my opinion is their best album. Although, I do have to say that their self titled album comes pretty close though.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've been looking for an app to download videos from youtube for a while because they're are A LOT of them for the kindle fire. This is the only one I've found that's completely perfect. I can sign into my account and download unlimited videos. Perfect.
B0063IH60K|2.0|too easy for me. Plays itself almost. moves are made quickly that you don't know what happened! i removed it and play another
0345803507|5.0|I guess if you loved the first two books you will probably love this one as well lol. Good book.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I watched this movie on pay per view and just had to own the DVD. All actors are amazing, the plot is captivating, I enjoyed every second of this movie. I'm really sad this is the last Batman with this director and the crew.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|This game is perfect. Except it reset itself for some reason. At least I still had my black suit. But if you fix this problem, 5 stars.
0812981448|5.0|I am a total sucker for inspirational books and those that give advice on how to start something. Most of the time I sacrifice one for the other, or end up with a series of stories that I've read a million times over (how many times can I hear about Colonel Sanders)?<br /><br />Blake Mycoskie writes from his experience without leaving any information out. You immediately feel his desire to help others do what he's done. And every story he shares has a practicality to it that you can apply.<br /><br />I believe he has done something with his book that matches the story of his shoes. He has shared his knowledge gained equally with the readers. His \\"shoe of knowledge\\" becomes our \\"shoe of knowledge.\\"<br /><br />He IS the Chief Shoe Giver. And, as Ed Sullivan always said, it's a really big shoe.<br /><br />Donna Highfill<br />[[ASIN:098364960X Real People, Real Change: Stories of a Change Warrior in the Business World]]

0375831002|5.0|Could only rate this book as the best. My order was speedy and the book was in perfect condition. Would recommend this to those reading from the best sellers lists!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Did not quite expect that this movie would be so funny. We liked that it was an adult theme yet was an animated movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book should come with a warning label. It will likely cause loss of sleep, loss of concentration and everyone in your life will wonder where you have disappeared to. Did I say I LOVE IT! I felt like I was there, living it. Felt like I could reach out and touch it. Beautifully written, great character presentation and very exciting story line. I wish it was more discriptive on Travis as a lover. I just wanted to hear that he was talented in that department. Overall, will be one of my all time favorites!
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|potty humor...if this is what you want, you will love this movie(and if you like the family guy).  I love family guy, but didnt find myself laughing much at all.  mostly one liners for the bear...seems to target very immature adults and 13 year old boys..
B000KIPT30|5.0|We walk a treadmill with headphones on, as we can't hear the TV really well sometimes without headphones.  However, some Netflix programs are too faint to hear through the headphones, so hooking them up to this amplifier has helped.  Very well pleased.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but I have the nagging feeling that it had a profound message and I didn't get it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is good because it is a really interesting story about the worst game in the world.  It is a story that keeps you hooked.  It is so good that I read this book in only one day!  I would recommend this book to a person who loves a good adventure or science fiction book, or just someone who enjoys a story about fighting for no apparent reason.  In conclusion, this is a really awesome book to read on a rainy day.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Don't waste your money on this movie, unless you like watching movies about druggies that are going no where fast and would throw everything away to get high with their teddy bear.
0446567337|3.0|I like the book and the movie. I got the book so i could watch the movie. I read the book first. It shipped in a timely manner.
B000TDGGVU|4.0|The first part of the book seemed to drag with the repetition of a single message.  But, the book does pick up and is worth reading.
B00000K413|5.0|TFFs debut album is essential 80s new wave. This album serves as a blueprint to all their music. Intelligent synth pop  with heartfelt lyrics. Maybe one day we could get a 2 cd deluxe reissue as well to really give this classic album justice !
B000SW4DP8|5.0|This film which, I surmised is based on a true story, lam blasts through to the essence of living:  problems, loss, integrity, honesty, grittiness, caring, anger, mistakes, love, and a little magic.  A real keeper in my book.
0316001821|2.0|this book was not my favorite. i did not like it one bit. It confused me and I had a hard time reading through it. I would not tell others to read this.
B000ASAEQW|5.0|Mozart:  Die Zauberflote<br /><br />I really loved this performance it was truly first class!<br />The star performance of leading singers were superb and the whole opera has never been better performed.
030726999X|5.0|This book was awesome.  The whole series is awesome.  The first book has a slow start, but once you get enough pages in you'll have to complete the trilogy.  I wish I could read more books like this.
B004SIP9O2|4.0|I thought it was great that when ordering this product it brought up similar DVD's that I would be interested in that could be bought as a package deal!  Also shipped as soon as it was available ahead of other items!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The price and the product were unbeatable, and with free shipping, it made my Christmas shopping much easier! Great addition to any Disney movie collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Worth every penny. All the extras are pretty fun to watch as well as the app you can get to go along with the movie.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|It's even better than the movie, and you'll love all the characters. It's really enjoyable and easy to read. I really liked it.
B000002MP2|4.0|I bought this for my son who is a big Green Day fan.  No collection is complete without it. Terrific
630471193X|5.0|Probably Travolta's best and rates with his Boeing 707. For those who like a bit of psychic phenomena, and possibly a little insight into what might be possible if we wish to believe the unbelievable, this is a terrific movie. It shows the real John Travolta. Someone without a heart could not make this movie. Apart from revealing what we might witness under certain circumstances, it also reveals the<br />lack of depth of the average human intellect, and why education should be the most important aspect of every government's budget. Even if you just watch it and appreciate a well made movie, good acting, good cinematography, good location selection, and everything that makes a great movie, enjoy. If you're looking for more.., you might find it in this movie, and you'll enjoy it even more.
B001NAT05W|5.0|This is an excellent 'stand-alone' movie -- no Batman & Robin here.  Halle Barry does an excellent job, playing 3~4 multiple personalities of the heroine, and the supporting actors are very good, too.<br /><br />The quality is excellent (DVD version), with very interesting Special Features.  This must have appeared before the Birds Of Prey series, but is very similar to the 'cat-iness' that appears therein.<br /><br />Probably doesn't deserve to be a 'cheapie' DVD, but even better because it is.
B005M2A4D4|1.0|Is this a black market copy?  The volume is loud then goes real soft and then it goes real loud again.  I am returning this to get a new one or get my money back so I can get another one.  What a disappointment when we sat down as a family after Christmas to watch this!
0307165485|5.0|I remember this book as a child.<br />I had to buy it for mine.<br /><br />We rarely read any of the stories - but the pictures are amazing.<br />My child can flip through the pages and loves looking at the pictures.<br /><br />There is endless material here to learn - I highly recommend this book!!
B000SVZIDA|2.0|Spent forty wasted minutes watching much ado about nothing.  Utterly tasteless. Actually not surprised; previews had always dicouraged my viewing.
B009NOVCU6|5.0|It's fantastic and great. It is a great complation album and brings back lovely memories of many concerts by the Stones through their 50 years career! Love it, love it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I truly loved this story. I haven't seen . The movie yet but I plan on it. I read it in one day!!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I liked this book a lot but it is a little slow at times with the heavy handed descriptions of everything and everyone.  Not as action packed as the first but still a good read.<br /><br />Some definite changes in the HBO series that make this book worth reading instead of just watching.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|okay to waste time with but takes too much of my time to play and I'm not a good artist
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Every season of this show is better than the last, and Season 1 had me hooked on the very first episode. Breaking Bad sets a new standard for other TV shows. I highly recommend every season.
B009GESJH2|5.0|KID ROCK! The man is an amazing entertainer.  Rebel Soul is packed full of hits.  Looking forward to the tour.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read. I've read it twice and still enjoy it. Anyone looking for a good story and interesting action should pick this up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in two days, because I could not put it down. I feel like some parts were predictable but the author always left you wanting more. I still want more. I want to more answers about Holder and his parents, if they ever tell them about what they have discovered. I want to know where they end up in ten years. A follow up to this book would be awesome. I highly recommend this book it's a great love story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I purchased this book based on popularity, which often leads to disappointment. This time though, I was pleasently surprised. Hopeless was well written with a stronger depth of character than usually found in a romance novel. Well done.
B004SF30HI|5.0|my son fell in love with rio over, and over, and over again. Still playing the songs. anything to keep him occupied.<br />Now he knows the words. wow what did i create lol
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have sharpened two of my benchmade pocket knives and three of my kerhsaw pocket knives with this sharpener.  Each time i get a smooth sharp finish.  The extended serrated sharpener is also a great function the smith has.  Small enough to fit in your pocket if needed.  A great tool to have.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Everyone should own this.  These movies are great.  There are a lot of extra features and having all three in a box set make the cost better.
B006964E8S|5.0|While I was saddened to see the end of the great Camel Club series, \\"Zero Day\\" shows that David Baldacci can write all kinds of imaginative thrillers. This book was a page-turner from start to finish and fully deserves a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Sergeant John Puller is a former war hero and now one of the best military investigators in the US Army's Criminal Investigative Division. He turned down West Point to stay where he wanted in the Army - where the action is not where the management happens. He is a skilled and extremely clever operator and was puzzled when he was selected to investigate an extremely important and very sensitive case on his own when a senior member of Defence Intelligence and all of his family are brutally murdered in a very remote coal mining area of West Virginia.<br /><br />A local female detective Samantha Cole is also investigating the case and soon finds that she is out of her depth and needs Puller's expertise and investigatory skills to progress the case. Their investigations uncover more murders, and attempts are made on their lives. The sleepy rural backwater turns into a battleground of deception, murders, bombs, assassination and threats to national security. Baldacci weaves an unstoppable tale that leave one on the edge of the seat until the very end.<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented on the similarities between Baldacci's John Puller to Lee Child's Jack Reacher. In this book I think this is a bit unfair as Puller is much more of a dedicated Army team-playing detective than Reacher and shows few signs of becoming a loner. However I re-visited this book after reading \\"The Innocents\\" where, unfortunately Baldacci turns Puller into a bit of a Reacher clone.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Found it to be the right type of movie for the holidays - a bit humorous, a bit sentimental and upbeat.
B00884GR0W|5.0|The first best would be minecraft but before kindle fire users could get minecraft for kindle this was what they would play. Block Story is a great game especially since its worlds are endless. All I think they need to add is precious gems like diamonds and emeralds and stuff like that. Otherwise this app is great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator! I would highly recommend.  It is visually appealing and very to use. Great value for a free application!
B008VBYN80|1.0|a game like this could be a lot of fun, if not for the pay-as-you-go gaming model. I tried it, and even tried buying some of the 'diamonds' for $1.99. I burned through them in 5 minutes. This game could easily cost you $20+ per day in all the extras that you have to buy just to play it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My grandson was given this as a Christmas present. It not only kept his interest but also that of everyone else in the house, adults and children.  When one person put it down another picked it up. It is very challenging, but they all loved it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If it were possible to give this book 10 stars, i would. I read this book in one sitting, and part of me wants to read it again. Colleen Hoover created a world that wasnt only realistic but heart breaking. From the moment i started reading i loved the characters that she introduced me to. i will definitey recommend this book to anyone with a pulse. its simply a story you wont forget
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was an excellent conclusion to the other two books in the trilogy.  I enjoyed the entire set of stories and was glad I had taken the time to read the books.  Thank you!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love that I downloaded this app to play on my Kindle. great mind game that I can play for hours.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a great little game that you can play with little time and keep up with. Can't wait to try other games from them.
0061120081|4.0|This was a required reading when  I was in school. Teenagers need to be taught about morality,'gray areas' and compassion at home.This book deals with a single Dad raising his two children( advanced subject matter for its time,even though a single parent household is run of the mill today)<br />This book teaches about judging someone based off of no knowledge at all ( Boo) and judging someone based off of their skin color( Atticus's client)<br /><br />This book is insightful and well written and does not lag anywhere.Harper Lee does a wonderful job  bringing an era and experience to the reader.Another book I would recommend as a  ' read together book'for you and your teen.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|What a great read, long after consuming this beautifully written book the story and ideas advanced by King lingers with you.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love having this app so that I can get Facebook on my kindle fire. I use facebook for staying connected with family.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have followed this author for a long time. too predictable.. but i miss the old Patricia Cornwell's mystery and intrique.
0345803485|1.0|A family member purchased the whole set which surprised me but like the curious little monkeys that we can be I picked it up.. and did not finish it.There was no need.<br /><br /> In fact it shocked me to find out that this person was able to write 3 of the most boring and laughable sex books ever. Okay maybe that is not fair since I dont really need to read about sex and haven't read a lot of 'erotica'.<br />If you do not want to read about tampons being removed or someone getting the smart beat out of them , then being raped, well do not bother with this book. This book sends a horrible message to men.Mostly that women want to be beaten and raped and treated like they are nothing. That woman just care about big penises, money and stature. There are so many other good books out there that are smart.sexy and well written and send a positive message to men and women I would not waste my time with this book.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Definitely the best Fast and the furious of them all. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|if you want to watch a long and thorough documentary about every aspect of the creation of star wars, including the writing process and influences and the painstaking development of never before created special effects, the battles with the studios and financiers who thought the whole thing was silly and ridiculous, the puppetmakers and puppeteers, the set builders, the concept paintings that blueprinted the imagery for the whole movie...i highly recommend this disc.<br /><br />there is another documentary i own, but as far as i can see, it's only available on VHS. it's called \\"from star wars to jedi\\". it has lots of footage that this documentary doesn't. and this disc has lots of stuff that that VHS documentary doesn't.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love the way the writer kept switching character perspective.  Full of surprises,.. can't wait to discuss it with my friends!
0307594009|4.0|The Diary of Anne Frank is just that a written diary of a young girl who lives part way through the Nazi occupation.If you like Jewish history or just history you will find this book to be a good addition to your library. Sad and charming at times the honesty that these pages contain are sometimes a little bit to much to handle. Especially if you know what the eventual outcome of the book and Anne's life was.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is a game of skill and practice. When you first start the game, you may get either frustrated or addicted. This game also, make your parents mad if you play it to much... but it's all worth it!!! My personal opinion is GET IT!!! Get while it's free!!! Don't wait till the last minute, OR YOU'LL PAY!!! Literally!!! Thanks for reading!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great fun.  geometrical puzzle game.  good interface and lots of levels.  ive solved up to nine by nine and they get challenging
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I live<br /><br />I love the app but there is something wrong with this app I play it and then I manage to get almost all the ponies but when I get back on the app none of the progress I did was there and it starts all over again. like I just bought the app. can ya please fix this problem. once ya do ill download it back again<br /> thank you.
0143039431|5.0|I am a little young to have lived  through the 'dust bowl' but Steinbeck's classic allows a person to do just that.We see man's inhumanity to man, how a family struggles even through adversity that may break or change some people. We see the tested quality of the human spirit.<br />Steinbeck takes us to a place where good values, morals and ethics were challenged. The descriptions are clear,the characters profound and easy to relate to.Reading this books whets ones appetite for more era styled books of this nature that weave a fictional person(s) in with a real part ,time,history of the United States. This would actually be a good book to read with your teenager with some printed up questions to ask him or her after each section.This book has many life subject to debate such as compassion and morality. I highly recommend this book.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|I first saw this movie with my children. I now have it on hand for my grandchildren! (but I secretly sneak and watch it when I'm alone sometimes) Delightful, with great principals that can be picked out during the movie. Love the lizard/dragon!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer<br />I enjoyed it.  Grisham is brilliant. xxxxxx xxxxxxx  xxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx
B007SGM084|3.0|I really wish I wouldn't have wasted my money buying the whole trilogy.  By book two I was pretty bored.  Character development was just lost.  The main character never seemed to grow at all.  The first book was worth it.  The second book is where I would have stopped.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Great, met all my expectations, loved it.  Put it on and listen to it while doing my house cleaning.<br />Music is so beautiful it is an emotional experience.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I love the ending!!!! Written to bring you along with the story!  I found myself talking to the book :) giving advice to the characters and more than once laughing right out loud!!! Indulge yourself!
B001V7SME2|5.0|Why yes, yes indeed. By avoiding all the vampire cliches, what remains is a hauntingly fantastic film -- lush, atmospheric, grim done good. Have a look.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It's a shame this author is no longer with us.  The Girl Who Played with Fire was a great novel that I couldn't put down.  As soon as I was finished, I was ready to dive into book three.  Such a great story line.  I look forward to a movie release here in the states.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|By far, the best book of the series. The suspense had me hooked and I struggled to put it down! I appreciated that when I got to the end, I didn't feel shorted. Instead, it fills in some of the story gaps from the previous books and gives us some of Christian's perspective. Simply, mesmerizing.
B002361MJC|5.0|Although there is no such thing as absolute proof, the studies contained in this book were convincing enough that even before I was done reading it, I decided to adopt a vegan or plant-based diet. I figured I'd done enough damage with a less than healthy diet and it was time to make repairs. My health has steadily improved ever since. I used to take Alka-Selzter almost daily for stomach upset and now I don't use it anymore. My cholesterol is normal again (was too high), and I rarely get sick anymore. Anyway, this book was the catalyst that gave me motivation to mend my ways and start eating more vegetables and no dairy or animal products.
B003I55BIA|4.0|This book was a definite page-turner.  I thought a lot of the characters and how they acted were pretty true to real life and I could relate to a lot of things in the book.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is, even though I know that the author was trying to make it seem as realistic as possible, the Spanglish did get to be a little too much at times.  I thought it was slightly overdone.  Also, not being fluent in Spanish myself, I didn't know what a lot of the slang Spanish words meant, which I feel took a little away from the book since it was a bit distracting.<br /><br />All in all, though, I liked the book, and I was pleased that it was very well edited.  I'm currently reading the sequel.  So far so good!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The subject and time in history are not very much known.  We usually heard about such terrible happenings during the mid 1800s, not earlier.  A great read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic. This book was fantastic. It brings you head on into the emotions the characters feel. You are right there in the story standing next to them. The main character Charlie, I feel as if I know him better then I know myself. I have never finished  a book before that left me feeling so many emotions. I feel so alive. I feel infinite.
B008476HBM|5.0|This edition works smoothly on a Kindle. There are no awkward gaps or strange spacing problems.<br />As to the content of the novel and the style of its telling, nothing I could say would add materially to its nearly universal veneration.
0307949486|2.0|This book contained too much violence and sexual perversion for my taste.  I did like Lisbeth, but wanted her to get help, not have to deal with all her issues alone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|from the very beginning, my interest was peaked.  I loved and hated the characters intermittently.  I found them both guilty of so much, and then the author would pull me on their side.  Well written.
B00A0R02HO|5.0|Good action film with good acting, the epic scenery really brings a realness to the world where this film takes place, and the director used the world enviornment very creatively that enhances the film with some unique action scenes,good pacing and story<br />  Thank You,<br />  Jerry Jay Hanson
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is fantastic. It'll strike home for anyone who's gone through high school. Charlie's tale of self discovery is filled with the highs and lows we all felt at his age. He is both naive and incredibly knowledgeable at the same time. Whenever he goes through a \\"first\\" he simply tells it like it is. Phenomenal book. We can all relate to Charlie in some way. Read it and enjoy the flood of nostalgia.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Although the premise is completely unbelievable and the ending is completely predictable, I still thoroughly enjoyed this book. Likable characters with intense chemistry who are both too stubborn to know what they really want equals a light, quick read of a romance novel with some nice tension-filled scenes thrown in there. If this is what I can expect from the new Harlequin Kiss imprint, I can't wait to read more!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I love historical novels especially when there is some truth in them. This book was entertaining. I couldn't put the book down.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|nuance and quick-witted humorous banter add to the poignant and warm story of this relationship between 2 clever women who live in a storybook new england town.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|best movie ever! I don't know why anyone would not like this movie. It is so beautiful on so many levels. I love it love it love it! you should definitely get it.
B0095R64AO|2.0|I really like Jason Segel and I really liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but this one just isn't nearly as good. Not all that funny, a little dark... I think it might have been a directing / casting issue.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|it's just what you'd expect, 3 discs with a lot of what you love from the stones plus their new songs.
B0086700CM|1.0|This app was a big disappointment to my daughter...it would not install on her phone.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT for my daughter
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I COULD not put the book down! I almost wanted to reread it to experience it all over again! instead I read Holders POV about the best almost first kiss ever. I highly recommend
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This will make the second review that I have ever written. The other review was left for a book I returned. I will make this short and sweet. I have close to 600 books on my kindle. I read A LOT!!! This book was beautiful, real, and very well written. Buy it!
B003EY7IRC|4.0|The entire series kept me very entertained and I loved her character. I would highly recommend this book and the series to anyone.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I can't believe I never watched this show before now! I ordered all of the seasons since I can't find it on Netflix.
B00338QENI|4.0|If you want to learn more about a subject that unknown to many check out this book.  The author does a nice job of combining layman's explanations of science and giving a voice to Henrietta Lacks.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Received on time and in excellent condition as promised.  Thanks for bringing some smiles into our home while we counted down to the New Year.
B0086700CM|3.0|The sucks part is that it won't let me tilt to get coins and other than that it is fine. Favorite game gone to waste
B00992CF6W|5.0|I aboslutely LOVE this app. I have been waiting forever to get it though,because it costs so much. But ive been playing it nonstop. The only thing i dont like is that you cant craft on your own but on this it has some sort of a menu. But other than that it is an amazing app i majorly reccomend it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic.. I read every bit of it in one day. I really captured the moments! Such a good book!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Terrible movie, terrible directing, Kristen Stewart is like the new Kevin Costner, sometimes british sometimes not. It kills my suspension of disbelief that she could ever be fairer than Charlize, (who I expected to be awesome but was just eh?) Chris Helm is decent eye candy but there is very little build to romance or actual romance. Fail Fail Fail.
B00846REIS|5.0|It comes as no surprise that I'm coming off the '50 Shades' series.  Sylvia Day is definitely a writer; no question about that.  Storyline is good, enveloping characters, etc.  I would recommend reading.  Disapointed that I have to wait until May for the 3rd book to arrive!<br /><br />However, is anyone else wondering why there are so many similarities between these characters in romance books?  I'm new to the genre but so far the male characters are young, hot, millionaires who have control issues while the females are gorgeous, insecure and clumsy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to access and to read. The features for sharing and saving daily bible verses with friends are excellent.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|This is the worse Batman ever.<br />It is meant as a bridge to hand the acting roll to another actor - really! dont make a movie out of a business decision.<br /><br />Bond movies dont put us thru the agony of handing roles between actors.<br /><br />Total waste of time.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this all the time on my phone. You have have all kinds of lists. I also have my shopping list with me this way. Recommended to several friends who also love it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I am not really a Wes Anderson fan.  I rented this because my husband really likes the guy.  I was, however, just blown away by this movie.  It is a very sweet love story.  Now, it wouldn't be a Wes Anderson movie if there weren't at least a few &#34;what just happened?&#34; moments, but there were substantially less of those than with some of his other films.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This one I have not used too much, but my daughter is the one who uses it. She likes these games.
B00124DQ2W|5.0|The Kath years were the best years. Lots say it, so do I. Passion, experimentation, a reining-in of Cetera, and magnificent brass arrangements. Early on, Chicago were producing arrangements George Martin could only have dreamed of (I'm sure Chicago stood on the shoulders, as it were, of those who preceded them).
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My 9 year old nephew read this book almost in one setting and that is not normal for him to do. He loved it!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It just wasn't what I had hoped for.  I didn't put it down often, but I can't help but feel that my dedication was due to wanting to just finish the book I had waited so long to read rather than due to a genuine interest in the storyline.  Quite honestly, I was a bit bored with it.  However, I did read more about JFK when I finished this book because it legitimately piqued my interest and I had, at best, elementary knowledge of JFK.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|I found it to be excellent,although some of the versions of some of the songs are different from their original versions.\\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is still better and,overall,I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND,to any true Led Zepplin fan,\\"UNLEADED/PAGE & Plant\\",as it remains their best LIVE concert performance! Of CELEBRATION DAY,I can honestly say that the high-def camera work and the multi-media stage show were superior,and the  performances were true to form...this is NOT a \\"Geezer Tour\\",to be sure,and although it is highly effective,at MAXIMUM VOLUME,\\"UNLEADED/PAGE & PLANT\\" remains the LIVE LED ZEPPLIN  concert that I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I purchased this because I've been thinking of joining the military and wanted to get a glimpse of how things really are in the military and in war, not how they are often portrayed in military/war movies.  The series is fantastic.  Very eye-opening.  Acting wise, James Ransone made it for me.  His character, who is based on a real soldier as many of the characters are, is great and he is an incredible actor.  I highly recommend Generation Kill.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Purchased this for a friend and want to buy myself one now. Really awesome show she puts on. Great to watch in background at a party.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|I was totally absorbed by the plot of this movie. The guy is my idea of what Americans should all be like... a hard driving man who works honestly and totally to support his family. His situation totally frightened me, because unemployment and living on low or no income really, really stinks. The casting and direction are superb, and this true story is told convincingly in a way you'll never forget. Buy it and watch it regularly to keep you humble and motivated.
B000000WJ2|5.0|This album is what I expected it to be and much more. Keith Richards is surrounded by an excellent group of musicians and a great vocalist that cradle his extraordinary talent. Some songs touch upon a subject that I can really relate to (yapyap), others are just very special and interesting little experiments of music and voices(bodytalk).<br />As for hate it when you leave; I have no problem waking up with that one and it being the last thing I hear before falling asleep.<br />This album is filled with words and music of wonder and I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates  the sound of Keith's raw and honest voice and his breathtaking guitarstrokes.........
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Great Series of movies.  I own them all now except of course Part 2 of Breaking Dawn which is not out yet. I very much enjoyed all of the movies and saw them all at the theater before I purchased the DVDs.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Never even knew what Twilight was until the second movie came out. That's when i was told to watch it. A friend let me borrow the first one and i was instantly hooked. I own all of them. Now I'm a Twilight fan.. no explanation needed
B007L3BMGA|4.0|It's a book that would make me blush if I read it a public place, because of the detailed hot discribed sex sceens. But I must admit it's alluring and keept me reading... what will Mr. Grey do next?<br />The essential story is not new nor mindblowing, but it has a fine pace and is good light reading.<br />Perhaps I am to much of a Twilight fan, but the character of Ana is to much like Bella - and also some of the other characters fx her mom.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this novel<br /> It was not what I expected  an  kept me on my toes-  I couldn't put it down!
B00005JLF5|5.0|I was a fan of TNG during it's original run and when DS9 debuted I gave it a shot and hated it. Recently I finally bought the entire TNG series and realized what I appreciate in the writing of the show had changed dramatically in 20 years. I was famished for more Star Trek so figured I'd try DS9 and found again my tastes had changed and I loved it. Great cast, amazing writing and the Ferengi didn't bother me nearly as much as I had expected. In particular I thought the episode \\"Duet\\" was phenomenal, it reminded me of my favorite TNG episode \\"Measure of a Man\\".<br />My only complaint is the special features. I was going to watch them before moving onto season 2 but after the second major spoiler I popped out the disc and will just move onto the next episode. So if yr like me and enjoying this series for the first time come back to the special features after season 7 unless you don't like surprises.
B004I2K4DY|1.0|Arrived timely however when I went to use in my dvd player did not play at all. Waste of money.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I find I have long stints of free time very rarely.  Instead I have many short gasps of availability from day to day.  Those gasps are filled in with Android games a lot and now they are filled with pretty Chess and that's it.  It really works great but sometimes the AI makes really stupid moves even at the higher levels.  At higher levels, even with those mistakes, it is not easy to beat.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a vary interesting book. I was carry untrusted in it I would recommend this to any one I know
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Fun read.  Chris is a true warrior and patriot.  I read American Sniper a couple months ago but I find myself coming back and reading parts over.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Old time movie, very well doen in the spirit of Santa Claus and those who start to get old enough to start disbelieving.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|McConaughey does a great job with his character as do Gershon, Hirsch, Temple and Hayden-Church.  The problem is that the film devolves heavily into shock and degradation towards the end.  My wife saw the film first and told me not to waste my time.  I wish I had listened to her. The script is tepid and the final scenes are simply disgusting and degrading to both women and men.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is the 4th time I've read this book in the past 2 months. I am so excited for the next movie to come out.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|Those of you decrying having this in 3D or the 3D should be ashamed of yourselves.  This is one instance where buying the 3D version of this documentary is not only preferred but necessary.  Any other nature documentary I would respond otherwise.  The 3D in this movie does what it needs to do, that is to simulate walking through a cave that none of the public would be allowed to for fear of outside germs degrading its state further.  The 3D in this movie comes closest to any of us here, celebrity included, being able to walk through this cave.<br />I'll go so far as to say this should be the go-to movie for museums showing in terms of nature documentaries provided they have a 3D projector.<br />For the documentary itself what seems telling the most are the paintings mentioned.  For being as old as they appear, they are very much not stick figures but beautiful art.  Just amazing.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Brandon Sanderson really breaks the fantasy mold with his writing. I can generally predict plot developments in a novel but I was wrong at nearly every turn in this one. LOVE IT and can't wait to read The Hero of Ages.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I can't wait to read the second and third parts of this trilogy. I've been a Follett fan for more than 20 years, and keep seeing him reinvent himself.  This is a beautiful and thoughtful piece of people and history.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Great movie - nothing more needs to be said - watch it now!  You won't be disappointed!!  I guarantee it!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|my children are entertained thoroughly while we are dining out and my husband and i can enjoy our meal.this app has a truly creative touch and we love it
B0091REZMW|3.0|I have this game on my boyfriends iPad and I love it. I just wish I could sign in to that one because I'm so much further in that one.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This one is fun. Not as predictable with counter moves as some games are. Will throw something I haven't seen before on occasion.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver is amazing.  He makes dry statistics come to life and really explains why they work and why they don't.  He understands his subject matter inside and out and makes you understand it as well.  Most importantly he gives you the tools needed to evaluate statistics given by others---how well they are or are not really looking at all factors involved.  I'd heard about this book during the election, and even though it wasn't something I'd normally read I am really glad I did!
B00867GKIK|5.0|&#34;Up&#34; is an excellent 3D family movie with a great store line and beautiful graphics.  The 3D graphics and experience was excellent.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very interesting perspective on the zombie apocalypse as it really illustrates the human side of the story.  Also quite interesting as it does so through news clippings and anecdotes.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It has been off a good bit with projected temps a few times. Almost cost me some plants had I not checked another forecast.
B002WR791W|5.0|I'd give it a 4.5, if that were available. This film gives plenty to think about after it's over. Both Americans and Japanese had more complex characters than the simple &#34;good guys/bad guys&#34; of most war films.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I thought this was just a waste of time and a ploy to get me to spend money on prizes.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I loved this movie, it will be a holiday tradition now. Appropriate for kids big and small! Very funny and entertaining.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is good and not easy to beat even though you only draw 1 card at a time instead of 3.
B007V65R54|5.0|I ordered the book because I was interested in Mr. Silver's thoughts on statistical modeling predictions, and if that's all it had delivered I would have been satisfied. What made the book most enjoyable (and recommendable) is its relation of statistical and probability theory to the biases and errors of reasoning common to our everyday thought.<br /><br />Even if you already agree with these principles, and thus don't need to read the book, The Signal and the Noise offers anecdotes and heuristics that will make it easier for you to explain the value of deductive reasoning and Bayesian thinking to others in the future.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a nice cover, especially for the price.  It doesn't seem to be as stable as it could be when you use it as a stand, but it does work ok.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Fabulous movie in 3D.  A must have for any 3D collection. Amazing special effects and cinematography. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I seldom play games on my kindle but this game is really fun. Now If i can stop setting myself on fire lol.
B003EVWDR0|3.0|It shows the 3D option but, doesn't show any depth even after selecting 3D option. Does it really support 3D
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game to kill time. Nice graphics and an interesting story line. It us worth $2.99. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004APVI1G|5.0|My kids saw this movie at the theater in 2D awhile back and really liked it then.  I purchased it in 3D and it was well worth it.  My kids loved it all over again.  I would definitely recommend adding it to your 3D library.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have a hard time logging off this app is amazing.  There are so many great ideas.  I LOVE pinterest!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|after to many angrybirds now its kind a boring now.. . . .  . . . . . . .
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|The movie was great and I loved it but the quality wasn't the best. It could've been because I was playing it on my tv via HDMI through my computer. The movie was still great.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Some friends and I saw this tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it. I've seen it twice so far. Definitely one of my favorite Tarantino movies. It was very entertaining. Filled with action, comedy, gore, history, suspense, and interesting characters. It had beautiful scenery, a great storyline and great sets. Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave who is recently saved and freed by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz. Schultz needs Django's help to hunt down the Brittle brothers. In exchange, Schultz will help Django find Calvin Candie, the man who bought his wife, Broomhilda. This was probably the coolest western movie I've seen in years. It had a great revenge theme. If you are offended by slavery and the 'n' word, you might not like it, but I would definitely recommend DJANGO UNCHAINED!!!<br /><br />HAPPY NEW YEAR!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Must have one in Xmas. i love every song. They make me feel happy everytime. I almost listen it everyday.  Fast shipping.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|ok.  So I got addicted to it too, for a while.  It's cute entertainment that even my 4 yo enjoys.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I've only had the watch for a little over one week, but so far I love it. It was much cheaper than similar style watches you might find at J. Crew or other stores. It keeps time well for an automatic watch. I have taken it off for a whole day at a time, and it still ticks along at the proper time when I put it back on. The face is a nice neutral color, so I can pair it up with different colored canvas straps. All in all, I am satisfied, and I hope it lasts a long time!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a pretty damn good game. It's much better than I though it would be. Actually has me playing it on my phone. I rarely play games on my phone. Put together well it is, Yoda
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't usually go for Stephen King but have to say, I really enjoyed 11/22/63.  He totally gets you so involved that you can really believe that this could really happen.  A great read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|i like the game ecept the part where they make you do all the facebook stuff and posting for twitter and following
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a fun game.  Easy to use but still makes you think.  I love that I can draw my own player as well as the person I need to rescue!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is about the fourth drawing app I've tried on my Kindle Fire and the only one so far that I've liked. This is the first one that was easy to use. Nice selection of tools. I did just buy it but was so impressed I had to review. After using for a bit I will update.
0399226907|5.0|When I was young, I liked the book. To this day I still like the book. Eric Carl is a great writer and illustrator. A fabulous read for kids and parent, to read to their children.<br />From<br />C. J. Glassberg<br />the author of Spunky the Cat - A pillar.
0425263916|4.0|Since 50 shades I have been reading books like this and this did not disappoint. can't wait for book # 3.
B003QP4NPE|4.0|i enjoyed this book becase, one i made the leap in one scifi area, the rest of the book was doable and well written
B000001FKY|5.0|What a big time seller this was! This is hands down,THE BEST album that Def Leppard has ever put out.Unfortunatly,this would also be the last studio album with the late great guitarist Steve Clark.What can I say about this album,that hasn't already been said before.This is an all time classic,no doubt about it.Including smash hits such as,\\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\"(the album version with the awesome intro),\\"Animal\\",the great ballad,\\"Love Bites\\",\\"Hysteria\\",\\"Rocket\\",the rockin,\\"Armageddon It\\"(my personal favorite)...and their first single release off here,\\"Women\\".Plus,the rest of the album is fantastic as well.\\"Gods Of War\\" is my second personal favorite.Overall,this album is a masterpiece,and it's The Lepp's best...right infront of \\"Pyromania\\".
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I gave it four stars for the amount of hours (4) that we play everyday, it's great for the hold family, my wife plays and my grandson. We all compete against each other for the highest scores.
B002VISNAS|3.0|Easy to read book, that is very entertaining and Fun. I am always amazed at Gladwell and his ability to tell a story<br /><br />I have found as I went through the book more and more \\"blink\\" like circumstances that other people have exhibited (e.g. picking a restaurant) that has been very interesting
144937980X|5.0|THIS SHOULD BE IN EVERY SCHOOL.  I WISH I HAD LEARNED ABOUT THIS WHEN IT CAME OUT.  MY SEVEN YEAR OLD IS USING IT ALSO.
B000001DV2|5.0|This album has always been somewhat looked down on by Lepp fans.I'm not sure if it's because this is the first album without their guitarist Steve Clark,or maybe they thought it didin't capture the same sound that \\"Hysteria\\" had.But for whatever reason,I still think that this is a great album none the less.It includes the singles,\\"Let's Get Rocked\\",\\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\",\\"Make Love Like A Man\\",\\"Stand Up(Kick Love Into Motion)\\" and \\"Tonight\\".The rest of the album is great too.\\"Adrenalize\\" has always been a personal favorite Def Leppard album of mine,and I'll always cherish it no matter what.Overall,if you never took the time to listen to it,give it a chance...it's well worth it.
0307949508|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a great start to this series but hard to get into until about page 55. The Girl Who Played with Fire is fantastic the whole way through. I couldn't put it down!!
B00002N9ER|5.0|This is same with photo.<br /><br />Hence I like it.<br /><br />Happy new year~<br /><br />(Mac lite agent is no good in Korea.)
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I'm not a fan of movies without an ending, but this one should be a movie by itself. Enough is enough the Bourne movies are over. The movie is a disappointment for a sequel, unless it's free. Not worth paying!!!
B009TQ77KM|5.0|Just buy it and never leave home without it, the main tool for a time lord! Feel like you are in an actual adventure in time and space with this magnificent tool!
1936608898|5.0|This book has honestly changed my life. It is amazing how the whole30 has improved so many aspects of my life. My mood is completely stable :) It's insane what sugar does, and how many products actually have sugar in them! I would recommend ANYONE to read this and to take on the whole30. I'm on the way to a paleo lifestyle, however what I learned from this book has really taught me how to stay healthy. It also encouraged me to look further into how animals are raised for slaughter, and what the government really does to our food. If anything, you will at least think before putting food in your mouth. Invaluable!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Although i have read what is this book about before i had bought it, it suprised me a lot. I did not expect this, how to say it, kind of story and the way it took. It is also the first english book I have read within few days as I am non english speaker - I mean English is not my mother language ;). Looking forward to the next two parts!
B007N8RULO|5.0|i just love this game it occupies my time when i have to sit and wait, i just get out the game and start playing making the wait much more enjoyable.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good but was hoping for more romantic. Sure Hope movie will be more romantic and inspire than the book.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app makes it so easy to get to my yahoo account. Getting my email and mananging the account is whole lot more easier.
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|Definitely worth every minute to read this book! Very well researched and written and an emotional journey of discovery !
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun, No problems. Was totally free. First got all 5 stars and it was over so then I challenged myself to all under 4 mins, then all under 3. Now I think I'm done with it. Good mahjong.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked the book very much. Fast paced and kept me interested. I can't wait to read the next one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love this. The twists and turns were unpredictable and always elicited an emotional response. I even liked that things didn't always work out how I wanted them to. This is the only book that I would spend this type of money on, it is well worth it. Well written.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Heard about the show so I figure I'd give it a shot.  Liked the twists.  Great move to give this show a shot.  This really is a good show.
B007GFDVEE|2.0|Even for a beginner set of Lego's this seemed little and lame when the box arrived. I thought my nephew still my be happy since it was Marvel. Nope. He's a lego beginner and he still dubbed the set &#34;lame&#34;. Ah well. From now on, lego purchases only in person.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It has a good story great controls and it is just awesome cool open world if you like this one you should also buy gamelofts batman game same concept
0812984412|4.0|but I liked the book and wanted to share it so i bought it anyway.  The book is a great read.
B00742GBDM|5.0|This movie is a must for your Jane Austen collection. I think the cast was just right for this production. You can really feel all the emotion and nuances of each character. The ending was delightfully satisfying.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|The game is fun and very interactive.  What a great concept.  The game itself is very well done and easy to use.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Best Borne yet.  Loved the story and the action.  Great stars too.  A must see for date night.  Get it now.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|i'm glad they have these books online for free. i can read these anytime and it's very nice that i can read these on my kindle fire hd.
1449415881|5.0|You can't beat Dilbert for looking at a business company with wit and humor. My husband is an engineer who works for the government and can still relate very much to this comic. I get him a Dilbert day-to-day calendar almost every year.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I like historical novels to begin with but I had read some bad reviews of the book so I waited for the less expensive soft cover.<br />And was very glad I gave it a try. It's a huge undertaking and has a lot of characters, but I found it interesting and informative. I'm looking forward to reading the next volumn which is now available in hardcover. Follett gives us lots of insight into all the countries involved in the first World War with his list of characters. And I was amazed at the extreme conditions of many of people in most countries at the turn of the century. The book is very enlightening in many respect.<br />If you like historical stuff, give this one a try.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very good account of life in the special forces. Don't be fooled by the title.  There is No Easy Day..
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|i'm glad they have these books online for free. i can read these anytime and it's very nice that i can read these on my kindle fire hd.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This was a great book! I never expected this book to be that great. It completely exceeded my expectations. This book is very good for preteens. It kept my eyes glued to the pages and my heart beating fast (especially at the end). I highly recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|ONCE I STARTED TO READ THIS BOOK, I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.<br />I WOULD RECOMMEND  \\"THE HUNGER GAMES\\"  TO EVERYONE.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This is one of the most boring and, at the same time, depressing movies I have ever seen.  I don't recommend it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|i'm fortunate to find this app and this really is one of the best apps out there. i can download my favorite videos or even download the mp3 version of it. these are then downloaded onto my computer where i can watch these videos anytime i want.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|A very fun game that my 6 year old granddaughter and I enjoyed each night before bedtime. She looked forward to it each night and it was very cute.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I hope you will find that Rick makes it easier to use a good idea to have been in the other side of things. Annabeth Chase and Percy Jackson are good characters in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books. I hope that you can enjoy the books too.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|A good-spirited adventure that was enjoyed by me, my senior citizen parents, and my scary story-adverse three year old. Funny and engaging.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|i'm glad they have this for free for the kindle fire hd. les miz is a popular musical and i just wanted to read this book myself.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Love this song!  This version has so much passion.  You can really feel the emotions. I reccommend it to everyone.  Enjoy!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I like this book and the other books too.<br />Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase are a good couple.<br />  Boyfriend.  Girlfriend
B0091REZMW|4.0|A really enjoyable game. I recommend it highly. It is quite challenging but on the downside it is also very time consuming.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|i liked this product because you're allowed to organize and delete products that you didn't want anymore. however, some files, like a lot of books, are not titled the title of the book. this is rather annoying to rename these books so you know what you're opening.
1878424777|5.0|I loved the simple language used in The Four Agreements.  He includes great examples that bring the ideas to life.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is a very challenging well for some people. but for me its not. well when I get to the blue coins it gets very hard. its hats for me because I start to panic.
B004RVCIEO|4.0|And I don't mean the color changing reptile, I mean the band. I can't believe none of these reviews make reference to  the 80s goth band, the Chameleons. Yes, they are lesser known than Joy Division which is perhaps why Interpol has gotten away with copying their music almost note for note. I love a good tribute band, but let's give credit where credit is due. If you've never heard them, please listen to the albums \\"The Script of the Bridge\\" and \\"What Does Anything Mean? Basically.\\" It tells the whole Interpol story. Sorry guys. I do like your music though.
B009471JQE|4.0|ZZ Top continues to do the Texas boogie like no other group... Great tunes, production and of course performances. They are true to their roots but with an updated style that brings freshness to their grit....

075669812X|5.0|LEGO Ninjago: Character Encyclopedia<br /><br />this product is is cheap and good quality.<br /><br />My son likes this book amd me too
B009Z8HPYM|1.0|The CD was a disapointment at best...let me put it this way, I SALVAGED a song or two for my mp3 player and deleted everything else. Songs over 20 minutes have to be good tunes and the jams must rock. These performances were boring and the production was weak. I could not believe the drum sound and mix it was horrible. I really dig Neil's music that's why I didn't bother to audition this effort. Don't make that mistake...
B009KHDT0C|3.0|The original Dark Shadows was serialized melodrama in the best sense of the word.  Every episode left you with a cliffhanger that had you coming back for more the next day.  The performances were uneven, with actors frequently forgetting their lines and searching for the que cards, but therein lay its charm because we got caught up in the quirky world of Barnabas Collins and Co.  Unfortunately, the reinterpretation in this movie was confused.  The trailers left us with the impression that this was going to be a campy comedy, and there are some cute moments thanks to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Barnabas, but it also tried to play out as a drama, and this is where it failed.  While I really didn't want to see Dark Shadows played for laughs, I think it would have been better to play up the melodrama and let the comedy come naturally.<br /><br />All in all, it wasn't a bad movie, but as far as I'm concerned, its real saving grace was Johnny Depp even if he wasn't at his best.
B0091REZMW|3.0|thought it would be a regular hidden object / puzzle. it lacks the mystery I seek. really do not like this game.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|I Bought LEGO Ninjago Kai's Blade Cycle 9441 for my son's Christams gift<br /><br />this product is is cheap and good quality.<br /><br />My son like this
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|Even though the critics panned it as not keeping up with the original, this was a great action movie that was presented dramatically and not in the almost comic-book manner the original was created in.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun app!  Challenging and many levels take some real thinking so it keeps it interisting.  I hope they come out with more levels.
B00004U45G|5.0|If you liked Led Zeppelin or the Black Crowes, you'll enjoy this tour de force by Jimmy and the boys. It was blaring from the kitchen in the summer of 1994 in a small but charming and excellent wayside restaurant in Quercy in sw France. When I'm headed down that way or on any other road trip, this is one of the discs that regularly gets into the 'road box'
1878424505|4.0|I have only read a small portion but looks like it will be good for some personal reflection and guidance.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Base on previews, we thought this movie would be hilarious. Much of the humor went too far for my taste.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Great production quality with a good story line and cast.  I really enjoyed this film.  If you like the scifi/action genre this movie is well done.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Like Lee Child's style of writing.  His books are entertaining and a good read!  An author that I will read again and again.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you are a fan of the batman series this set is a MUST OWN! Amazing set! Batman rises does an excellent job of introducing Robin to future batman movies and lot of potential!
1476719071|5.0|One of my favorite books of 2012. It had me gripped from the first page . absolutely a must read cant wait for walking disaster
B009HEJXFS|1.0|This movie did not live up to the MIB expectations.  The special effects looked cheap and the acting was sub par.  I used to think Will Smith couldn't do a bad movie...well...I was wrong.  The only saving grace in this movie would be Josh Brolin's performance.  He did a great job portraying a younger Agent K
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first got this book I wasn't sure what to expect. I can  tell you how many times I cried with Sky.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Go ahead, rent it to find out how to waste your time.  THen watch it again to confirm you wasted your time.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie fell so far short of expectations that I had to write something.  The entire script should have been scrapped.  Production funding must have been mostly to pay BW and then the cheap asian effects company.  Not even B-grade.  Won't bore you with the details.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Eastwood is an all time fav.  Hope he lives forever.  Movie was easy watching and kept us interested.  Witty and charming, fun and entertaining
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome I can't explain it yeah it is kinda like temple run but it's way cooler. Temple run is beginning to get out of style subway surfers is coming in everywhere I go I see almost everyone playing it so I hope you guys like it you won't regret it
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is the best Batman movie ever made, with the Dark Knight following in a close second. You couldn't have asked for a better ending nor could anyone have made a better one. If you think otherwise, please go ahead and enlighten us with your own ending. I bet it would have sold millions.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is beautiful christmas music. I received it just b4 christmas to have it in the car to listen to it instead of the radio stations old worn out carols.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Found myself skimming through many of the beginning chapters to get to the story.  Very repetitive at times.  Glad I finished it, ending chapters were a surprise.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Downloads and installs easily.  It works as intended, no problems as I have come to expect from Amazon delivered products
B0056BMK6K|2.0|This book is great for authors who are millionaires who have the cash to burn by paying a couple of thousand dollars to have their books professionally edited, formatted, and<br />designed by an author services company.  And how about those reviews!? Specifically the way Locke left out how he paid over a thousand dollars for reviews of his book! Now, I get that he's a businessman, and I appreciate the success he's had as an author, but for him to write that reviews are a big part in the road to sales as an indie author and not disclose that he paid for them is somewhat deceitful. Locke has said he didn't care if the reviews were good or bad. Ok, great, but being the businessman he is he insisted that all of his reviewers download (at his expense...he bought his own books for them to review) be bought through Amazon, which of course shot up his sales rankings. Good for him, but tactics like this simply aren't workable for the majority of DIY indie authors who are strapped down by budget and/or ethics.<br />His business plan was fine, but I felt it was nothing groundbreaking...be smart with your blogs and tweets, and get a website. His advice on how to gain guaranteed buyers was sound, but I'm on the fence if it was worth the price of admission.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play cards. this is esp nice because I can use it on my wpandigital novel. Solitaire is one of my favorite games to play.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books I have read in the past year.Awesome story about a true warrior long live the the botherhood

B0079J28NC|5.0|Remembering the old US version on VHS, this was a real treat to see. Very vibrant color, excellent audio, this is a very fun product. The packaging is very handsome and.... exuberant. Just makes you smile!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I have a habit of buying my favorite movies and this haPPENS TO BE ONE OF THEM. i love owen wilson.<br />I was in paris just for a day. This is woodie allen at his best. the story is great.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|We got these cases for the Kindle Fire HD's (not the upgraded size ones..), and the cases would NOT fit. They were much too small, off by at least 2-3 inches on the width, and an inch or so on the length/height. This product is misadvertised, and I sincerely hope that amazon and the distributor(s) take the time to properly note that this product is NOT FOR KINDLE FIRE HD's, both the regular HD or the upgraded screen size one.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|A bit difficult to assemble but shoots as you would expect.  Doesn't come with the full amount of cartridges as the gun can accommodate, but luckily our nephew received FOUR Nerf guns this Christmas and he can interchange the cartridges.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app I play it like 5 times every hour and it never gets old it is very edgy and entertaining
B009X01GJ2|2.0|It was very disapointing for my daughter's only gift from me to not fit the Kindle Fire HD that she owns.  she loved it until she tried to use it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael and Harry are back better then ever. No one develops the characters better to dra the reader into the story.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a very different game from any other I have played. It's fun to replay the levels and find the secret items.<br /><br />I like seeing the stick figure interact with the items plus there are explosions and penguins. What else do you need?

B00AAX68HG|3.0|It's an addictive but enjoyable to play game.little gello slime that u have to slide around without falling off the table not to mention trying to get all three stars can b hard.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was a fast paced, exciting, and entertaining as with all the Jack Reacher Novel.  Lee Child does it again!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|No complaints. Never read this author before so I had little in the way of expectations. But I enjoyed the book very much, both the writing style and the originality of the story.
B0086700CM|4.0|Awesome game!! Sometimes it can get a bit pixely but over all great app for any age even though monkey-things creep me out a bit!!
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|This was slow moving and depressing. There was a lot of physical violence. No one in my family liked it.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Love Bob Marley and this album has almost all of his greatest songs.... and you can't beat the price. Maan....
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I really like this product. The music is beautiful, the price was amazing. Getting the songs on my computer was a matter of few minutes.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|We enjoyed it - but my husband ( who is actually British and should get the accents better) and I both had problems making out words - we turned on the subtitles.
145552347X|5.0|Hitchens, even in his last throws of life, again manages to produce an ounce of perspective. Very good read for anybody who is a fan of Hitchens other works.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|If you are looking for basic entertainment Ted is the movie.  I found that after you were in to the movie the same repetitive humor lost its appeal.
B00371XIJE|5.0|It was accessible and very easy to view... I love buyingon amazon video. About the movie it is definitely for pet lovers and their loyalty. Great movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book and better then the movie. I can't wait to read the next two books. I'm sure they will be just as great.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|The first with Arnold seems dated today but the story and action where better than this new version.  The concept of this movie seemed a little old.  It's as if they tried too hard to focus on the effects and forgot there needs to be an engaging plot for viewers to get behind.  In the first movie there seemed to be two stories, the fight for better living conditions by the people against a corperation and the cover up by the coreration.  The new versions plot is more about this man who is trying to find out who he was and the story is just swept under the carpet as something that just happens.  It's not a bad movie but if you expect it to be anything at all like the first then you'll be disappointed.  I would have prefered to see a updated version of the first movie with better acting.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  There is alittle bit of Harold in all of us.  He is just as imperfect as we all are, filled with our regrets and faults.  It is his humanity and gentle spirit that endear him to us.
0142419400|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this is almost as close to the perfect romance as you can get. I absolutely loved the book, and it was one of those books I did not want to put down. I was completely enchanted by the story line, the romance, and the delicious humor. I would never call this cheesy nor sappy, but if it is, it is the kind I love!<br /><br />Anna was a wonderful character, but it gets no better than Etienne St. Clair! Having had an English friend in the past, I was intrigued to see how much St. Clair was like this friend of mine. I loved the British mannerisms, terminology, and more. And yes, I know that St. Clair was not truly British, but in so many ways he was! I was enchanted by the humor. So often the books that I read miss the element of humor, but this book had me laughing out loud at many times, but there were times that the tears threatened to come as well. Stephanie Perkins is a master at writing emotion--period.<br /><br />There was only one thing I didn't like. Profanity in the book did not show up until much later into the book, and although the profanity was not prolific, I did not feel it was necessary. Thankfully there were no bedroom scenes. Yes, there were some sexual terms that were dropped here and there, but I was not overly offended. I am glad that Anna was a virgin--always appreciate this in books!<br /><br />I would love to read a sequel to this book, and maybe one day, Stephanie will do that for us. I doubt I am alone in wishing to see the saga of Anna and St. Clair continue. This was a nice romance, and at the end I actually experienced chills it was so good! If you have not read this book, and you like romances of any kind, this is the book for you!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Well done.  A song for everyone, very pleased with the music. A great addition to their first full length album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story was excellent. It was really hard to put the book down. Such excitement and there be a character talented to overcome the trials in the Games.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I enjoyed seeing mature actors like Arnold and Sly. I also enjoyed some &#34;campy&#34; comments as well. This is not a film that requires deep analysis or thought.  Just sit back and enjoy. It is an action packed film and it does not pretend to be more than that.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|overall funny just a few scenes that you can see mark w acted alone and they copied and pasted the teddy bear.  They overdid it with him saying dirty jokes otherwise its worth watching
B001JIFYSA|5.0|This is great for a night in, just chilling.  It's not some masterpiece, but it is super watchable -- like a drinkable beer.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I left my iphone in my condo in Vermont and I needed and an alarm. I got this alarm and I love it &lt;3
B00000ITOY|5.0|This is one of my daughters favorite puzzles.  She received it at 16 months and still loves it at 26 months.  Well made set!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book- it actually has a story.  If you liked this book, try SEA OF TRANQUILITY.  It was similar in that it has a surprisingly good story.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I luv it so much kids and grownups will kiss it so much! it is iddicted to it though I luv it :)
B004LWZWGK|1.0|The movie is ok.  The first two in the series were great, but this one isn't as good.  My one star rating is not about the movie, it is about the product, which is the DVD/BlueRay/UltraViolet combo pack.  On the packaging it says you can download this to your PC and devices.  that is a whopper of a lie.  You can not download a file to your computer and you can not transfer it to your devices.  What you can do is install the flixster app on your device and watch it through the flixster app.  You can stream it through the app or you can download it on the app so that you can watch it even if your device has no internet connection.  However, you still must open the flixster app, which crashes a lot and also the sound is really bad when I watch a movie through flixster, but not when I watch amazon or itunes purchased movies. Hmmmm.  Even if you purchase a movie on flixxster it costs more than on other sites and you aren't even getting a real digital copy.  I will never buy another Ultraviolet combo pack ever again.  Like I said, my rating is about the movie but of the product itself, so if some of you want to bash me for not rating the movie then grow up... Rating are supposed to be about the product and that is exactly what I am doing here.<br /><br />With that said, I wish I had purchased this from Amazon because they have great customer service and I'm sure they would allow me to return it.  However, I didn't.  What I should have done, and what I have learned for next time, is to buy the DVD/BlueRay combo pack and purchase the digital copy on Amazon or elsewhere (NOT on flixster though or the US site) and I would have paid about the same price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I figured this would be your typical boy meets girl love story. I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat, so I didn't think twice about buying this one. I was so shocked by the outcome of different aspects in the book. Every time I turned a page, I was delighted with something new or shocked by something unexpected. I think Hoover did a great job talking about a difficult subject. At times, it was hard to remember the characters were still in high school.
B00275EGX8|3.0|this movie was excellent. i've been wanting to see it for a while but never got around to it. when it dropped to $5 i had to jump on it and i'm glad i did. while i cant speak for the accuracy of the movie it was an entertaining 2 hours.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger games<br /><br />  liked this book because it is a series and i love series and its a  thrilling book to read and i am not even finshed yet.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|our grandson who is 6 years old loves to watch movies..his face was full of joy when he opened this present...highly recommend..
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I liked this book because it very funny and it tells you things you shouldn't do for a dance! In this book Greg(the main person)has trouble getting a date to the Valentine's day dance, but when he finally gets a date he has to share that date with Rowley!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The music from the 2012 film production of Les Mis is fantastic!  If you liked the movie you'll love this sountrack.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I can't bring myself to give it five stars, but it was pretty good. The concept works a lot better than I expected. It's realistic without being cheesy. The one-liners scattered throughout combined with the purpose-driven action sequences make this movie a enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Updated Review as of February 1, 2013: After five or six viewings, the movie is now five stars in my book. Would definitely recommend.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|bought this as a git for our future daughter in law..she was vey excited..she loved the movie..buy this one..great gift for anyone..
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Cannot wait for book number 3.  A lot like 50 Shaes, but both Giddeon and Ava are messed up and still love each other.  I'm addicted.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Excelent edition for an excelent movie. Quite complete list of extras, blu ray plus dvd and digital copy (phisical disk) included. A real masterpiece from Wes Anderson!!!
0316920045|1.0|After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I gave it about 85 pages and then totally gave up on this snoozer.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love love love this book.  have read/heard it 4 times now. Cannot get enough of Anna and Christian.  My favorite two people.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Loved the movie The Vow great service will use again good good good good good good good good goood good
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The game is real fun and I can sit and play it for a long time a never get tired of it. I highly reccomend this to everyone.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book begins at a leisurely pace well suited to the setting and characters.  The plot is introduced smoothly and with subtle nudges told from the perspective of a man ending a journey instead of starting one.  There are moments of Forrest Gump \\"I figured since I had run this far....\\" at the start of the book and when he starts gaining followers, but not overwhelmingly so.  The changes in tense and time are handled with admirable subtlety and seem relevant and well placed.<br /><br />The characters are few and are given depth with a combination of interactions both current and recalled.  Their characteristics and the humanity of their personalities develop and change as the journey progresses.  It has a similar feel to Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven and rewards you with insight as you read.  The reader develops a certain amount of empathy towards Harold root for him to succeed.  I would say that for younger readers (YA and below) a lot of the themes presented might be a bit mature, though not in a graphic or inappropriate way,  thereby, not allowing them to connect to the characters and without that connection this is just a story of a man taking a walk.<br /><br />As with the journey taken by Harold, not all of the memories are pleasant.  They are presented with a woeful tone of regret for decisions made and actions taken.  The bitter mixed with the sweet, a sense of melancholy and quiet acceptance for the things that have passed are presented in contrast to the hope and defiance of the journey itself.  I enjoyed every step of the journey and would highly recommend this novel.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I have seen many, many horror films in my life, and this is a top 5 standout. It's been years since I've seen a film I simply could not wait to purchase the second it came out on DVD, and Sinister is that new film. The music is something that stood out immediately as terrifying; by far the scariest soundtrack I've heard in a very long time. It adds an extra dose of fright when fright is due.<br />Another positive is the lighting and, to an extent, the setting. The overall look and feel is literally dark, which is fitting for the dark content of the film. The ambience as a whole was very well executed, and matched up perfectly with the plot.<br />The cast's performances were quite good, with Ethan Hawke being especially convincing, although the actress playing his wife did not come across well, and she gains no sympathy for her character. Even though she is continuously &#34;screwed over&#34; by her husband, you really can't feel sorry for her- all you really want is for her to stop whining. The children did very well, as did the other cast members. I love me some V D'Onofrio.<br />The plot is definitely my favorite aspect of the film, as it is more original than nearly any horror film I've seen. Yes, 'original' can flop, but when it doesn't, it's truly a pleasure to watch. I was on the edge of my seat during the length of the film because- and this happens VERY rarely- I honestly had no clue how it would end and I was dying to know what would happen. The storyline just hit all the marks perfectly in my opinion, and I thought it was evident that everyone who worked on this film truly collaborated in every sense of the word. It just came together like the perfect storm for me, evidenced by my ravings to all my friends and family members since I saw it opening weekend (and once more two weeks later. I would have totally gone for view number three, but my husband isn't that big on repetition, though he did love the film). I highly recommend you at least give this a watch.<br />Warning: there are scenes that can be disturbing in this film. There is very little blood and no gore, but there are children in not so nice situations in the movie that can definitely cause a negative reaction in sensitive viewers. However, it isn't graphic, so there are definitely worse movies as far as unpleasantries go. I myself HATE blood and guts, so I would never recommend a movie with any substantial amount of it in its content.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson does it again! Burdened by his contractual work finishing up the Wheel of Time series for Robert Jordan's wife, Harriet, Brandon did not have the time and focus needed to write another wonderful epic trilogy like Mistborn. But he wrote a novella well worth reading that someday we can only hope Sanderson works into a full-fledged novel. Both my wife and I quickly read and immensely enjoyed The Emperor's Soul. Please don't stop writing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book. Once the realizations and truth started coming out about Sky's life I couldn't put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a very good book it scared me when I thought there could be only one winner so  excited for catching fire
B009HEJXFS|4.0|We had to take a break after about a half hour and resumed the movie the next evening.  Had commented that it wasn't as good as the previous 2 but found the last hour funny and engaging.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Another fun movie with Jamie Lee Curtis!  Not only did it give us laughs during the holidays but we will be watching it throughout the year when we need a chuckle (but not just a mindless chuckle... it also has a much deeper underlying life lesson).
B009WO7NQO|5.0|best game ever &bull;it is a great game so adikting and awesome. it is s great game mitture star wars and anger birds awesome _
0792164911|5.0|My fav Johnny Depp/ Tim Burton collaboration- better story than Irving's original- an excellent supporting cast and Christopher Walken IS the Headless Horseman!
B0052GACNM|5.0|How could anyone not like Tony Bennett!  I love his choice of artists to sing duets with.  The quality of the product was very good and sound was clear.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Literally unwatchable. No comedic value, horribly written, we did not laugh a single time in the first 30 minutes before turning it off. Please do not waste your time.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Will Smith is such a good comic actor! My whole family really enjoyed it. Clever premise involving parellel time realities.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Great price on the 3-way combo, Blu-ray, DVD and download- gave two of them as gifts and kept the download- it's the only way to go!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|[[ASIN:B0061JPYX2 Lioness: Hidden Treasures]]<br /><br />This album is absolutely amazing! Amy was such a great artist and it is unfortunate her life ended so soon. Her music will live on as a testament to how great of an artist she was.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love Mumford and Sons's sound and I'm glad to see they haven't strayed from their first CD too much! Could listen to this CD over and over and not get tired of it!
0763655465|4.0|This was a fun read for my son. This was a fun read for my son. Sure to be a winner with a new reader.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Showed the dichotomy of slaves vs owners and overseers in a personal way.  Well developed characters and their interactions.  Well researched and well written.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|One of the best franchise ever !! A great story always must have a great ending!!<br /><br />HP & TDH Pt 2, brings all these excitment in the last chapter of the saga !!<br /><br />Great to watch over and over!!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Love Taylor's new CD!!! She's a great song writer and I like that she uses her personal experiences to draw from.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|I guess you could say this app is worth exactly what I paid for it. That is - \\"nothing\\". There was a lot of promising features when I first install it. However try as I might I couldn't add a song or album to a play list. The bottom line is that it appears to be a wonderful app for playing song with except you can not get it to play the songs you want.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|It was like being there!  Love the story telling Beyonce did in the video.  She was so transparent and warm throught the video.  Dance moves and lots of action.  Very intimate setting. Worth every penny I spent.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince its a great movie in the franchise, expect great FX and a intresting story<br /><br />Recommendend to spend a good time with the whole family<br /><br />Great movie!
0345529057|5.0|so..shall I say &#34;riveting&#34;?  George RR Martin is a most gifted writer indeed, meticulously crafting this lush, very often violent fictional world with deft strokes of language. Each player in this &#34;games&#34; saga is expertly fleshed out, even the &#34;bad guys&#34; given the sort of nuanced descriptions that make them as compelling ( if not more so !) as  the embattled heros and heroines. I can't get enough!!
B009JZPH32|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. What a waste of time and money.
B008DKBPTO|4.0|I read lots of reviews before getting this sleeve and I was not disappointed.  I feel that it is sturdy and all the protection I need to carry my precious kindle in my purse.  I liked this design much more than the others offered.  The only thing I wish it had was room to store the charging adapter and cord but it is not a deal breaker.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was awesome and I loved the narration. It was kind of mature for my age, but it was a great book.
B006O3MU96|2.0|I can't understand why it's a different version than normal DJ. It works fine on my Droid X however doesn't offer more than another theme for the boring DJ. I got it free otherwise I never tried this App. Even if its a HD why should we find about it from the other reviews? Developers have been so passive for Android platform and I can't recommend their DJ for this platform.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|it was a good movie those guys were so funny when they were not being serious  i loved watching it
B0000024TQ|5.0|He loved it, had always wanted to replace allot of his lost music on the reel to reel tapes.  It made him happy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book started off slow but once you learn the twist it just flew by . Amy is a very clever character
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|My son is a nerf gun expert. He LOVED the hailfire for christmas. Ammo shoots out very fast and very far.
B002ZG999U|5.0|this was such a good movie I really liked having a lot of the older guys in it .my husband loved this movie
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Ya that pretty much sums up my opinion on this app from ebay - it is also very  very quick.
1476704163|5.0|I have always been impressed by her music, but, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and have a new found respect for her as a person and an artist.  And the service from Amazon, totally amazing, thanks.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Arrived fast and in mint condition. The 3 best Batman movies ever made, gave this has Christmas gift to grandson and we watched them all day after.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book took me on a emotional rollercoaster. It starts of as your boy meets girl story and halfway through has a twist and it than turns. I did enjoy it, but wish some of the reviews would have put in about sexual abuse so at least I was warned going in.  Good ending though.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|If you've ever felt you don't have enough, or feel you have too much....time, read this book. If nothing else it will make you appreciate every precious minute, hour, day we have.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Charlie was strange but admirably beautiful in the book of his sweetness,honesty,and loyalty. A excellent book! Not really any words to describe it!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Another great book from Ian McEwan. I totally disliked Solar, so I start reading Sweet Tooth with low expectations, but in the end, I liked it a lot. As I am not British the references to MI5 and MI6 were not so easy to follow, but still the whole &#34;spy story&#34; was very captivating. Sometimes the literature issues were a bit boring but the end makes it a great book. So, keep reading until the end.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game. It keeps me entertained for ages. Very addictive. There are lots of different levels. I play . it every time I have a spare minute.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book sucks you in and doesn't let go, not wanting to do any thing but sit and read too the end.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was the best diary of a wimpy kid ever and the best one I gave have ever read in my day
0307593525|5.0|Finally purchased this set for myself.  Working my way through Vol. 1, reading and enjoying.  Love the approach and look forward to cooking from it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think this is a great book for anyone married or planning to get married, it really gives you guidance on how to intentionally love and be successful at it by meeting your partners needs in a way that is effective for them!
B009K0P10K|5.0|The second season so far is great. Love the actors and actresses.  I really wish the main protagonist ended up with Jack and not the switched girl.  But oh well. I'ts not my show.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought the first book was good but this one is just as good if not better! I'd recommend this book to anyone!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This is a great film reflecting how couples, young and old alike, fall out of step with each other. Routines, kids, life gets in the way and couples stop allowing focus on the two main players.  Before you know it, you're housemates but not spouses except in name only.<br />I was touched by how strong the fear of rejection was portrayed in this film.  We grow older and are afraid of our spouse not wanting us anymore.  The first film I recall actively presenting this was 'Failure to Launch' with Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw, another great screen couple that have terrific chemistry, much like TLJ and MS in this film.<br />I didn't have high hopes for the film as I am not a huge Steve Carroll fan, but loved him in this film.  As big of a TLJ that I am, SC and MS really are the ones who nailed this film for me.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|The case feels pretty sturdy and keeps the phone safe.  I've dropped it a few times and there has been no damage to the phone, though there is a big scratch in the case across the display now.  The only thing I don't like and didn't realize before I got it is that it makes the phone much bigger (so it doesn't fit in stuff designed for the iphone) and the part that goes over the screen makes it much duller. Another thing to keep in mind is that you can only use official apple chargers when the phone is in the case because of the size of the connector.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|a very touching story of a manic depressive who perseveres and succeeds in taking down giants in the terrorist realm.  the first episode's first 15 minutes draw the watchers' attention.  so thrilling to watch
