B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Really good book, the setting is really believable, and you feel like you are there. The characters are easy to relate with. Enjoyed reading it, and guarantee that it will be a better read then the series that is coming out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great series! Lots of twists and it keeps you guessing. Never know who is going to die or when. Just the right amount of gore!! If you have not seen any episodes it is worth a shot. Just be sure to start from the beginning.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|I purchased season 3 of Downton Abbey.  I have only been able to watch 4 episodes.  When I tried to watch tonight, I received message that the web page was not found on Amazon site. After searching site for 30 minutes, I finally found a place to contact Amazon.  There I received notification that the site was having technical difficulties and to try later.  I just tried again and now the video series doesn't even show in my account any more.  I am furious after paying $14.99 that I can't watch it.  I will try for a refund of the episodes I haven't watched.  I will stick to iTunes in the future for these types of products.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A book club choice which was a love story between characters, but also the author's obvious love of the circus and the belief in all things possible.
145470246X|5.0|Beautifully illustrated, great instructions and overall an awesome book. I would recommend this to<br />every beader.  I especially liked the bezelling.  .
B00B99KJR0|5.0|this game is addicting..grows progressively harder...has story line....if you have problems downloadeing check your available memory...works great on kindle fire
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Season 5 has been the best season to date!  The Castle/Beckett banter is back and their relationship gets better and better.  The rest of the cast has been given the chance to step up to the plate and be featured and they all have hit it out of the park!!  I can't wait until tomorrow to see the 100th episode!  I have been with Castle since the first show and each season just gets better!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a book I could not put down. I enjoyed every minute of it. I have a feeling it is one I will be retreading in the near future.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|this adapter is great. I like to keep a hard wire to the internet and with this adapter i'm good
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a very fun new twist to the very popular first version. It has very nice graphics, and is like candy for your eyes. Plus, its free! You can't get any better than that! :) All in all it is a great app which is a big boredom solver! :D
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watching through amazon prime is easy.  The show is addicting. Love everything about it. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys drama
B000001G7C|5.0|This is a wonderful recording. It makes me want to listen to more of Tchaikovsky's works! I'm very pleased with it.<br />.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|If you're a fan of the tv series then this CD is for you. It is missing one track that is advertised, but it's the perfect partner for the tv series and one that'll keep you coming back for another listen.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I don't pay for play time. It doesn't take much time to play out the free games and then I have to wait for 8 minutes to play again. It's amazing fun when I'm able to play, though.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is ok. Sometimes you have to tap an object more than once during the hidden object games or pinch in before it will let you pick up the object.  But all in all a pretty good game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What can I say but it works. :) A calculator is a basic tool that we have had for years, so we only notice when it doesn't work. This app is easy to use, accurate and properly uses the screen.  I recommend this app to anyone but especially people whose eyesight may require reading glasses because to won't need them with this app.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Thriller that keeps you guessing until the end. A must see for fans of legal action. Lots of violence could use more sexual
B008745B32|5.0|I was somewhat reluctant to purchase the book after I learned that this edition was abridged from the original manuscript, but if that were the case, it did not hinder the story or the development of the characters in my opinion. Everything about the novel drips with the aristocratic style and language of pre-war England. I'm a great fan of the PBS series Downton Abby, but this is for me, the real deal, none of it dumbed down for television viewing by Americans. Charles Ryder, is the aloof narrator, who tells his story over more than a decade, from young Oxford student who falls in love with the beautiful Lord Sabastian Flyte, and with his entire family and their ancestral home, Brideshead, and later through an adulterous affair with Sebastian's younger sister, Lady Julia. Charles' remoteness, presumably the outcome of having been raised motherless and by a father who can hardly bear to have him in the same house, allows Charles to observe everything and everyone around him without becoming overwhelmed. Other characters, some highly developed, drift in and out of the story, some delightfully quirky, some sweetly charming, some sadly banal, all necessary to the understanding of the changing times. I'm one who prefers to have the ends tied together, but this is Evelyn Waugh's story, and he leaves us a cast of characters whose lives can only be conjectured in the aftermath of two world wars, the dismantling of country houses, and of a privileged way of life.
B00A3XWB10|5.0|Since the first album, Crashdïet didn't make another REALLY kick ass rock and roll record... until now!! Savage Playground rocks!
0345529057|5.0|Great buy. I'd love to have the rest of the 3 books in a similar size when they are available.
B001675YQ6|3.0|this movie was just so so, the acting was alright but the plot was rather silly and over all was just a dorky movie with lots of queers in it so it was just odd...
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|awesome good everything but if you make a second version it shouldn't make you have wick to play just the game its annoying
0792165020|4.0|its creepy, its suppose to be...so its good, gwyneth paltrow was excellant in it :) and matt damon did creepy just oh so well, it was a good movie, might make you scared of homos though lol
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|There's nothing unique about this game. It's like all the other tile swap games, but this one has great colors and all of the ways to make bonus points really push you to use strategy. Be warned that it eats through a battery charge in no time. I play on my Droid razzr and Kindle Fire and I have to charge up after only an hour or so. Granted I shouldn't be playing more than an hour, but like I said, it's addicting.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is so sick it needs a &#34;get well&#34; card.<br />Off the chain and bombastic. Get this album...today. Yes.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This was a great app about a month ago until they updated it and now its not nearly as good. I'm going to find a different app that is better.  If something isn't broken then don't fix it.
1476712042|5.0|In this genre, I have yet to find a book that can even come close to this.While I can talk myself into enjoying most of the books I read, I can usually pinpoint where each one is lacking. Not in this book. It is a slow burn and you feel it all the way through.  I felt every emotion the characters were feeling.  I literally fell in love with this book as the characters fell in love with eachother. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00BWJ6JO4|3.0|Content paused too many times.  I ruled out my connection as the culprit by viewing other content at your site.  No issue.  I will hesitate before streaming something this new in the future.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I AM HOOKED.<br />THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER, I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME<br />VERY FUN AND RELAXING.TRY IT OUT.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Neither American or French, I had great fun reading about the idiosyncrasies of both nations :-) I recommend it to all the girls, not only mothers.
0451457994|5.0|2001 A Space Odyssey, the book is great.  It makes a person think about what the greater scheme of the universe is all about.  The things that we do not know and may never know until death.  This book gives the author's idea of what may happen after death and that causes the reader to think deeply about our role in the universe.  This book is highly recommended for young and old to read.  I must note that the movie with the same name is nowhere close to being worth watching because it leaves out the end of the book completely.  The end of the book is what makes it worth reading and not watching.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Book includes some recipes and useful tips for running. I would recommend it to all who liked Born to Run.
074356619X|5.0|This audio set really helped me to change my thought process and as a result change my life for the better. After listening to this series, it made me crave more education on self motivation and how to stretch what Ive learned from the secret into all areas of my life. This is a door opener and a starting point for other audio/book series such as \\"The Law of Attracting Money\\", \\"The Science of Influencing People\\" , \\"NLP\\", and many more!
B009FXIICK|4.0|This game is so fast. I finally manipulated the pause button to complete the higher levels. Was very disappointed to see that level 10 was not the highest level! Finally got up to level 15 to learn that that was it.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|So far it has worked pretty flawlessly sharing between my phone and TV. Haven't used it for much more otherwise
B004JHYRP4|5.0|Read it when it first came out years ago and then picked it up on Kindle to reread and pass it on. Great story and the story behind why he wrote it is equally good!
B000ZOW96Y|1.0|After it stopping and refusing to recover about 5 times I finally gave up. No way to tell if it is the hotel wifi or amazon streaming, but certainly frustrating.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It's is a good book but I had seen the movie so it didn't keep my interest. But I'm still forcing myself to read it
0765348276|3.0|There was a lot of lead up in this book and ultimately I was hoping for more than the author delivered.  There were no interesting revelations, no insights into an alternate version of humanity, it just left the ending open to a possible follow-on book where the hero and his genetically deceased wife might find each other in the future.  It was OK for a used book and I will pass it along to another reader to make their own decision.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|someone recommended this book to me. It was one of the best books I have ever read.  Loved it told everyone to read it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing Spider,I play at least once a day, it's relaxing for me and I will play until I win. My 5yr. old granddaughter loves to play too,she always wants to help me, but, also likes to play herself.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|My daughter enjoys puzzles and games that make you think and remember. This game was both. The Mystery of Grizzly Manor was another game that is on the same order as this one. She liked that one as well.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A truly amazing book about a boy who is different than everyone else who is trying to fit in in a harsh world. If this book does not become a classic, there is something wrong with all of us. It is written beautifully and is heart wrenching, emotional, and humorous.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoyed this game.  great for players new to this type of game as well as players familiar with this type of puzzle. would purchase other games in this series.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I have owned this album in LP, 8-track,cassette, CD and now on digital version since I first bought in 1973.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Zero Dark thirty dramatizes the United States operation that found and killed Osama bin Laden. Like most movie adaptations of real events, it sometimes strays from the historic version to provide an entertaining movie going experience.  That doesn't mean that it is a bad movie, it is a very entertaining, dramatic and suspenseful even though you know how it ends.  Jessica Chastain does a great job at playing the hard as nails driven to obsession CIA agent who tracked down Bin Laden.  Although there are some controversial scenes such as the torture and waterboarding of individuals, it does not detract from the movie being a well told, well acted entertaining film.  I think the film does a nice job at giving you some things to think about, such as whether torture is a means to an ends when it comes to terrorism without being too political on the message.  It rightly portrays the real heroes of the movie, the men who risked their lives to go after Bin Laden and the people who worked on the intel for years to find him.  And even if the events aren't always true to life, it does a great job at making it believable and worth watching.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Jessica Chastain def deserved an Oscar nomination, she did a superb job!  The movie was overall well done!  I recommend watching it!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Love the lord of the ring trilogy movies and books. I read the Hobbit and it was great just like the movie. Can't wait for part 2. I purchased the lord of the rings trilogy from amazon and plan on doing the same with the Hobbit.
B00BHMF578|5.0|It was witty, well-written and well executed!  Well done to everyone who had something to do with this movie, especially Ben Affleck!  The Oscar for best picture was well deserved!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was so cute and had an amazing message! I definitely didn't expect the ending. I do have to say, it's a great kids movie and a great adult movie. My favorite quote still has to be \\"Children of the Candy Corn\\" haha :D
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Bought this for My sons birthday! He is a huge mindcraft fan and is going to absolutely love this! Thank you!
B001GWK2MC|1.0|I bought the Intex jump o lene for a friends 2 year old boy and he loved it. He's an only child so what little use it got was only from him. About a month into having it it began separating at the seams which made it difficult to repair. Now if it had puncture holes in it I would say ok user error but since it began separating at the seems all over I would have to say Poor quality. Dont buy!!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Awsome book!!!!!!!<br />I strongly recommend it!<br />It's Gnary, and it's worth all that you read!!<br />Uglies is about a girl, Tally, who dreams of being pretty, literally. She learns that becoming pretty identified what the doctors say it is!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots of fun and well worth the .99 cents.  It took a little while to stop using hints but then became a good memory game to.<br />w
B009K0P10K|5.0|It kept me hanging every episode so its a good thing I kept getting the episodes on my Kindle! Emily is so great and Nolan is fantastic!
1582701709|4.0|You have to have an open mind.  I can see where some would day it's nonsense but not me.  It makes sense to me.  People believe in God granting help and answering prayers.  Maybe the Universe is God.  It's about keeping your mind open and believing that things like wealth, love, etc are possible for us.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Overall an extremely fun and addictive game. Once you start playing you can't stop! All the goals and unlockables are great, love it! The only problem is I can't log out my Facebook account...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's the most fun game ever it's easy to get coins and even gems!<br />I hope you get this  awesome  game too
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|this is so awesome and cool I want to play this game everday<br /> nice {&bull;_&bull;} &lt;3 this is the most ninjas app
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is awesome I couldn't understand it at first but then I got the hang of it<br />I highly recommend it
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this app, only issue i run into is some frame rate lag when there are multiple dinosaurs near each other. The only way i know of to fix this is just by spacing them out as much as possible.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|THIS GAME ACTUALLY CALMS ME. I am gravitated towards this game every morning &amp; at nite before bedtime.Get this game &amp; the others. You'll be pleasantly surprised &amp; eerily calm when you play any of these game. I'm off to buy more and have some fun.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'd choose this as a great note app that is so easy to use, and a nice app with many types to organize!! It's all you need in one app, Evernote!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Loved the book! The only thing that I did not like wad the fact that there would be a really good part to almost the climax and then the story would move onto another subject.<br />The ending was wonderful! Now, I just have to download the two other books because I feel like I have been left hanging and am very curios to see where the story line goes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game never gets old. Just the daily missions and missions along  keep me logging on and wanting more. My kids and I are constantly in competition and its entertaining for all my children who range from 4 all way to 16...gives us all something to share a interest in and Laughs.
B0070YDOT8|4.0|A fun little time waster.  I enjoy the games to help with long hours of boredom. Wish you didn't have to spend so much money to get addons.
1400069289|4.0|This book is a fascinating study of how habits - which govern almost all of our daily lives - really work. Using examples and interviews from figures in the worlds of science, psychology, sports, retail, government, business, and religion, Duhigg explains how all habits are triggered by cravings for a particular emotion or sensation - sometimes an unconscious one. These cravings are set in motion by a particular cue, which leads us to perform a certain routine, which leads to the reward that satisfies our craving. Repeated enough times, this cycle becomes a habit.<br /><br />Duhigg is a thorough, articulate writer, but he tends to interrupt interesting interviews with his sources to start describing another seemingly unrelated example, which may seem abrupt or unorganized to some readers. There is a reason to his method, however. These apparently unconnected examples are in fact introduced into the narrative in order to clarify a certain point in the preceding case. Duhigg eventually always returns to the previous story if you keep reading.<br /><br />Some readers have also complained that Duhigg does not actually tell you how to change your habits, but this is incorrect. Duhigg also includes a handy appendix at the back of the book which gives you tips on how to do this. (It probably would have helped if he had used it as a separate chapter actually titled \\"How To Change Your Habits\\" instead of relegating it to the appendix.) While he doesn't spoon-feed you detailed steps because everyone's particular habits are different, he does give general tips on how you can change your habits or adopt other ones by identifying your routines and cues and substituting different routines into your habit loop.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Pros:<br /> - Good sound quality<br /> - Good sound isolation<br /> - Very comfortable (could wear them all day)<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Persistent problems with on/off switch (really really annoying ... it's an ordeal to turn them on and off ... I did research and other users have had this problem)<br /> - Intermittent buzzing (not often but annoying when it happens)<br /> - Mediocre battery life<br /> - Mediocre software<br /><br />Other notes:<br /> - Sensitive mic (almost too sensetive ... pics up everything in the room)
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|Been playing on my galaxy nexus 10 for a little time.  Appears to be a good time passer if you like run jump change direction type of games.  It was Amazon's free app today.... March 30, 2013.  Even if not free, I would consider purchasing.  I only have a few keepers.  After more playing time, it may turn into a 5 star.  Happy gaming.  For specific action, other reviewers have covered well.  It's fun, give it a try.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I could spend all day on Pinterest and come back the next day.  There are so many good recipes, cute ideas for all topics and there are always new and interesting people to follow.  I love the inspirational pins as well as the fashion ideas.  I would highly recommend this site for everyone with all varied interests.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I'm an Angry Birds fanatic.  But Stella won't deploy her Bubbles on command.  This makes it impossible to 3-star on some levels.  Rovio get this fixed, and then I'm a 5-star happy camper.
B004YXE438|2.0|Not enough picture choices in free game.  Boring.  I don't like the square pieces.  Would rather have regular jigsaw cut pieces.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|true to the book... great movie!<br /><br />I can't wait for the next part to come out... Wonderful job so far!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|A very nice game you can play it for long hours without getting bored.  Simple ____a lot of fun.  This app works perfect in Android

B006MW3UZW|5.0|An incredible series.  I recommend watching every episode.  The characters draw you in.  The writing and the acting are top notch.  Good way to see top rated actors make it look so easy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You train a horse to do compotions and in the compition you have to swerve around cones and barrels and jump over fencace. They're games to.

B004I744AS|4.0|Was looking for good medical terminology dictionary and this one is very good, simple explanations, easy read.  Allowed me to understand words in a medical job description so I could help someone with mock interview, so it fit the need.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|love this movie with harrison ford and tommy lee jones.  remake of the original movie from the 60's.  very good movie.<br /><br />  recommend it to anyone who likes harrison ford.
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|What is going on? Watched Ep1 with purchase of whole season and can not play any other episodes. They disappeared from my video library. May be the end of Amazon Prime for me. Try to get help and wait is 30+ minutes. Until amazon gets it together avoid streaming purchases.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|It doesn't work! I cannot even get it set to local weather. It is totally stuck on another time zone and I cannot get any weather in my time zone.
B00846WWVM|3.0|The controls are difficult to use after a few levels have been passed. It's a cute idea, but not easy to use.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|very inspirational  loved the story line and the true story shone through! I choose it based on the actors would watch it again!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I enjoy this game as a way to keep sharp. It is an easy way to fill some quiet time.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Review of Jackdaws by Ken Follett<br />If you are in love with World War II spy stories, Jackdaws is the book for you.  Based on a true story, Jackdaws is the account of an all female British team of spies who parachute into France in 1944. Their mission is to blow up a chateau that houses a vital telephone system, used by the Germans, to pass critical information from France to the German command.  Destroying the telephone system is vital to prevent the Germans from being able to warn Germany of the Allies impending landing on the beaches of Normandy.<br />The plot of Jackdaws is filled with breathtaking twists and turns with suspense waiting for you in every corner.  If you want to relax with a good read, buy Jackdaws.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game so far, just beginning to play; hope it is challening for me. most games like this only let you play so long then want you to buy something to continue.. have been looking for a hidden object game for some time.. back to playing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|There are lots of free games and one must really think as they get more complex.  You can purchase hints, but you can also work on puzzles over and over without getting constant ads appearing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is very addicting!  I find something new and interesting every time I get on.  I truly love this site.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This battery charger is an excellent addition to a avid electronic users arsenal. It easily fits into your brief case, backpack and handbag for easy usage. Great for professionals, students and travelers. Do not leave home without it and risk having your cellphone die on you.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Old batman taking it to the bad guys! Different, definitely for adults, made me see batman in a different light.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is an autobiography of great transparency, well written, and unfolded against the backdrop of the magnificent, and sometimes utterly overwhelming, High Sierras of the Pacific Crest Trail.  Anyone who enjoys a wilderness adventure and the exploration of the human depths of both grief and bravery, will love this book.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Cannot beat this family movie as the kids may not understand some of the video game characters, but the adults that do, you will be laughing throughout the whole movie!
0802473156|5.0|Arrived quickly and I really like the format of the book. It has been helpful and entertaining. I will be ordering it for friends.
B00005UL6G|5.0|I liked the 15 min. of extra footage. This is one of Christopher Lee's best movies. They used locals for extras which was cool.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought all 3 Hunger Game books after I saw the movie.  I was glued to each book as I read them.  Can't wait to see the next movie because of the visuals so well described in the books.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|This has been the most popular book my book club has done this year. We didn't necessarily agree with her parenting style, but we were all fascinated by the book and it generated a great discussion. (We're all moms.) I thought it would make me angry, but not so. I immediately \\"got\\" the author's subtle humor in showing the sometimes ridiculous way she parents. It's self deprecating humor - the way I might tell a slightly exaggerated story about myself to make a point. And I was glad to have read the book because there are certainly times when I could -- and should -- push my children a little harder. For instance, the other day while teaching my teenaged daughter to cook, she complained about chopping the onions, so (as usual) I started to do it for her -- then remembered the Tiger Mom and made her chop those onions! I disagree with many of her ideas, but found the book quick and easy to read and very entertaining. I kept turning pages. Also educational, because we have a lot of high achieving Asian kids in this area (my own children's friends), and now I feel like I \\"get\\" them. I'll be a better mother for having read this book.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|this is an app you have to think about, Recommend highly to all my family and friends having fun playing
B0060AY6FO|5.0|If you love Pride and Prejudice, you will love Death Comes To Pemberley.  PD James took over where Jane Austin left off.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This is a must read for anyone who wants to change the world. For 40 plus years I thought I was twisted. This book nourished creative ability I have squelched.
B000V5Y1SQ|1.0|I liked later seasons of this series when it came out, but I think it took a while to get something going. Eventually there'll be great villains and the characters will grow into their own, but here--not so much. Plus, it feels like an attempt to see how cheaply they could make a Star Trek show, with few and claustrophobic sets. I could go on, but I highly suggest skipping on to season three.
B0076HNCTQ|4.0|I loved this venture int my recent past....Twin Peaks was one of my favorite &#34;who-done-it&#34; with a twist.  The quality of the streaming was however sub-par.  Not sure if it was the source or my ISP ( each would point the finger at the other, eigh?)
B004KRQFI0|5.0|I just recently discovered a genre for what I had been calling robot music.  Skrillex is king of dubstep.  He has created an album that was way past my expectations, not always to my liking, but always a signature of a particularly interesting human.
B005DNPKSQ|1.0|Even if you really want to get bored and waste your time do something else rather than watching this movie!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this will keep the kids and maybe even you busy for awhile. just make sure you use the parent block for the cash items.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So happy I finally got to watch season 2!  Can't wait to start the next season.  It is a very engaging series, you never want to miss a minute!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|If you appreciate history, then this is a must see.  Lewis' portrayal is how I will envision Lincoln from now on.
B009KEN87O|5.0|reminds me of a version of the old Atari game space invaders with an asteroid twist. then it goes three dimensional depending on the power up you capture. simple yet fun and challenging. nice work!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a great and easy to controlled game. but it doesn't get you to new levles.and people say this sucks on kindle fire.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Had some questions on using Kindle e-book publishing.  This book answered my question almost immediately as well as gave me answers to questions I hadn't even come to yet.  If you are thinking of, or have started a book to be published on Kindle, I highly recommend this book.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I was really pulled into the story, it was very well told.  I could easily picture the characters as the story unfolded.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Sweet and engaging, if not really a standout literary experience. Good &#34;beach read&#34; I guess I would say; not super realistic or believable, but sometimes who cares?
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|really good game. controls work good and pictures are crisp.  the story line is goofy but fun. i think you will like it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|dude, this is literally the best game ever. Well one of them this is soooooooo soooooooo much fun!!!!!  u should soooooooo get it.GET IT! GET IT!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|History comes to life in this Fantastic Movie!  Great Acting and writing, A movie I could watch over and over again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best horse game out there! Yes it is time consuming but it keeps going and you never get bored. Awesome graphics and really fun! Plus all those people who say they use real money.... why? Its just as fun without speeding it up with extra coins and gems!
1616550414|5.0|I have been a long time fan of the Zelda games. I even got my dad into it. This was his 55th birthday present. Naturally, I took a \\"flip\\" through it. You know, just to ensure it was good. He loved it. It seems that I may need one for myself now.
1451629184|5.0|I think the book was very well written about Jacees life as  a kidnapped sex slave.  The monsters who did this should never be free.  My heart  goes out to her.  What a brave women who survived her capture.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Awesome movie got to say can't wait for part to come out clear good hd you have to look at this movie
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This is an AWESOME film. I loved it. I did not think I would but I do. My eight year old daughter even loves this movie, and even sings along. Its a MUST see!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It just kinda ends! A little bit more detail in the end and I would have given it 5 stars.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|I like this album a lot.  I still like the album Waking Up the best.  I still recommend this album highly!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Whenever i get free time i find myself playing plague.  Its difficult but fun and works the brain very well.
B00BX2QTWC|5.0|...epic...sensory...orchestral.<br /><br />At first listen, it felt like the lovechild album of Antony and Bjork (especially SELMASONGS), yet entirely his own.<br />It bears repeating and repeating, due to its richness.<br /><br />Enjoy....:-)
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This app is awesome and it cam be very relaxing.  It makes you think about how you are going to complete each level without getting sucked up by another orb
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book that keeps you guessing and keeps you reading! Once it gets to a certain part you can't put it down!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so like MC pc. Just needs a few more updates and I would love to have redstone tools in 0.7.0!
B00BF11STU|3.0|A docu-drama, meaning that it tries to convey what is known about the effort to \\"get\\" Osama bin Laden. As it took years of intelligence gathering to do this, at least 45 minutes or more is spent on intelligence collection (torture) and what an intelligence analyst does. Interesting but not all that entertaining or enjoyable. Then some politics and bureaucracy, again, informative but... Finally some action. I not saying it a terrible film and perhaps worthy a higher rating based upon its effort to report but I had trouble getting through the first 30-40 minutes. Intelligence analysis is not very exciting stuff and difficult to actually convey in any real sense. Date night movie? I don't think so. Spouse shared movie?  Front-end of torture might be a bit too much. Action flick for guys?? Only at the end. Again, a docu-drama.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I PLAY IT ON MY BUS BEFORE SCHOOL ALWAYS! Its a Blast! If I had to buy it it would be worth the money!
0316113514|5.0|&#34;Spark....&#34; covers information about exercise and the brain that should be shared with people in all walks of careers and life situations. It is especially critical for educators, as movement has a huge impact on the learning that takes place in our classrooms.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a Blast! If I had to buy it it would be worth the money! I play it on the bus going home. Bad days instantly turn good!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was the first book I have read in a long time.  Now that my kids have gotten older I had some time to download and read a book and I am so glad that this is the book that I read.  I loved the story and all the ups and downs that Louisa and Will experienced.  It was so gripping and did an excellent job portraying both sides of a very sensitive issue.  While I was rooting for one side, I was able to understand the other side which I guess left me feeling not quite as sad by the end of the book.  I am not very good at expressing my thoughts but every time I think about this book I just can't help but want to read it all over again.  I have recommended it to many people.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I chose this rating because it was more then just an okay movie.  There was lots of action.  The movie was a little long, but I supose it should be to get the entire story out there.  I would recommend this movie to a friend.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Love this game! It has quickly become my favorite android game. Even on my cheap prepaid phone I can I play without issues.<br /><br />Really fun to play, good controls, lots of replayability, and just a great time killer!
B006CR2PD0|5.0|This movie is beautifully filmed, well acted, erotica, and should be in the DVD collection of everyone who has a reasonably healthy libido.
B009PAETCG|5.0|Love game hope updates are good and cheap but to easy but still love game my mom says it looks really fun to even though I'm  18
B008220DGE|2.0|This felt like it could have been a great movie. The movie was trying to say something important but ultimately, it failed to do so. The performances were good and the main characters fairly well developed. But the problem was the story. It was foggy and confusing and never resolved itself. Was Joaquin saved or not? Did this whole thing really do any good for anyone involved? Was this a big con job or was something really going on? At the end I just felt like I wasted over 2 hours of my life.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Great book, but a bit of an uneven flow due to the Irish baroque at first.  I will read more from Christina McKenna for sure!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Want to read a fun and delightful book- moves fast, funny, yet has many values as to good relations- Easy to read, quick and fun--Enjoy
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Interesting story lines. Can't seem to stop watching! Bring on season 4!  The acting is surburb and so refreshing!  Well put together cast!
B003J27WFW|5.0|One of the best rock doc's I have ever seen.  I thought I knew a lot about Rush ... until I saw this.  You will be hooked from the opening credits and will be left wanting more.  Even if you're not a fan of the Canadian power trio, the story telling is exceptional, one of a kind.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game. I am soooooo addicted. a bit violent who doesn't love a little bit pain lol. also its free so if ya hate it then delete it. 9 times out of ten you will love it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I picked this game at random. Game was Easy to learn and very addicting.  Recommend for adults and kids.  Have fin!
B0074YVW1G|4.0|This book explores the differences between introverts and extroverts and how each one can be powerful and successful in today's climate. It certainly helped explain some of the issues in my relationship and actually explained why I often feel the way I do about wanting some peace and seclusion.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I own quite a few watches that range in price and quality, but this may be one of the best values in a Swiss made watch on the market today.  It is a handsome, well-made watch.  If you're looking for a really nice quartz watch at this price point, and with a chrono to boot, you cannot go wrong!  I get as many nice remarks about this watch as I do my very pricey Swiss automatics.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|it does only last 10min. but just hit play again a<br />nd build the same area hello!? didn't you other people know that? :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read it for book club.  I was so absorbed that I finished it in two days,even with twin 13 month olds!!!
B00BESLHEA|1.0|mostly promoted sex story action was violent and storyline very weak.  Expected  more.  Not suggested for kids at any age.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Whether or not an individual believes in the life after death or not, Proof if Heaven cannot be ignored as it is written by a neurosurgeon who, at least, can explain the nature of how the brain functions and how his experience is beyond explanation, but still an experience.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Pretty good game, lots of improvements from first game.  More challenging and lots of fun platforming.  The sound is really nice.  Love the Viking helmet thing.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Its like the super friends but with presents. Enjoyed most of the characters, but the Easter bunny was not that likable. Really liked the fact that Santa was Russian with tatts. Good for the kids and just enough innuendo for adults to snicker at.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game I just love it I have a cool map with a village with 2 stores 2 houses I thank 10/10 just awesome my m<br />om got this when I just got my cilde fire I'm happy oh I forgot &quot;GET THIS GAME
B003QTNFHW|4.0|Kids wanted to see this again. For me, it was actually better the second time. Burton does a great job of Alice revisiting Wonderland as a coming of age teen. It may become a classic.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very funny--never a dull moment!  Fast moving-great detail in defining the funny side of human nature-no holes barred as viewed from a senior citizen.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I love the story of Anna Karenina, but this version was too stylized for me.  While I appreciate the art direction and costume design, the direction and weak acting made for a boring movie.  I need more than pretty things to look at.<br /><br />Keira Knightly is always in films with great plots, but her acting consists of squinting her eyes and letting her bottom lip hang open.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|We have been looking for this for a while one of my husbands favorites!!!!! Now our family can enjoy a favorite of his together!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I'm so sad to see this show end, I can't get enough , keep you in suspense and you never know what is going to happen, Love it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was amazing full of surprises, action and romance. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the ending was great. Suzanne Collins had a great imagination and I want to thank her for the best series ever \\"The Hunger Games\\"
B000I3SYEI|5.0|This is by far the best star trek film with the orginal cast. Ricardo Montalbán is one amazing actor. Love this movie
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Great acting & directing -makes you very humble to think about the sacrifices those people made- but so heavy on the political diatribes that we were overwhelmed.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've always enjoyed John Grisham's novels as must-reads for plane rides, beach vacations, and surgery recoveries.  They are usually well-plotted and clever, with the protagonist being a rogue smart-mouth, usually funny and ultimately sympathetic.  My first few chapters of reading &#34;The Racketeer&#34; did not disappoint.  &#34;Oh, this is going to be a good one,&#34; I thought as I raced through the first quarter of the book.<br /><br />But, alas.  Grisham's densely plotted, and ultimately unbelievable tale of a corrupt judge and a falsely accused prisoner (Malcolm Bannister), who manages his release from prison based on information only he has been privy to, ultimately fails to engage the reader from about the middle to the end.  &#34;Too much telling, not enough showing,&#34;  we were taught in Fiction Writing 101, and Grisham, who used to be the master of this craft, has forgotten that adage.  Plowing through page after page of the recitation of his characters' actions, rather than having the action in the moment, lead me to think, &#34;Is this ever going to be over?&#34;<br /><br />It's a shame.  It seemed to me as if Grisham wrote the first half and someone else,  less talented, wrote the second half.  There are those who would disagree with me.  And the Grisham name sells books like crazy, no matter what.  I just long for the days of &#34;The Rainmaker&#34;.
B008AS5UAO|4.0|This particular recording had been reviewed as one of the best of last year's classical releases.  I am a devoted Don Giovanni fan and I wanted to extend my collection of different versions.  This version seems, at first, overly loud until I realized that it was recorded live, so that it was necessary that the singers projected their voices.  After several listenings I was glad to add it to my collection.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It is just a nice tool to have. It helps to know just how much time is left on the battery if you are out and about.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Block Story takes you into another world and it's really hard to put it down.  I find the graphics to be excellent.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|great jammin band!if you like southern rock/jam bands, you'll love this cd! a cross between the allman bros, marshall tucker band, even a touch of AC/DC with a sprinkle of Black Crowes...anyway they're awesome and their live shows are a must see!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is an awesome adventure with a horse for a partner. I really enjoy playing my horse. I love it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele and this CD is just wonderful.  Her voice is beautiful and she can really sing a song.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|A lot of people look at this film as being unrealistic, and at times silly, or not true to the era. Well they are wrong. The 1920s even though called \\"The Roaring Twenties\\" was also known as \\"The Plastic Age\\" because it was an era built on a balloon of plastic dreams, and plastic lives not worrying for tomorrow just ready to bust (which did come the great depression). A time of people running around without much care of what may happen (one reason leading to the stock crash of 1929). This film shows some of the laid back almost complete naive mentality the upper class had during this era. An era of care freeness at anyone's expense that hit the USA post WWI, and some circles wearing plastic masks over their true identity.  A good example of this are two films staring Clara Bow entitled \\"It\\" or \\"Wild Party\\" from 1927 and 1929. This movie shows you great early 20th century prop sceneries, and yes, it does stick to the book as close as it can. It's the best version I have seen and each character fits the novel characters about how they should be.  There have been other film versions of this book including a 1926 silent film (considered lost), and a 1949 \\"modern\\" version which is awful. This is the best film to date for The Great Gatsby. It takes you into a world...a time you'll long want to experience...but at the same time want to leave some of the superficial characters behind. An era where technology was just starting to take off (no air conditions yet), but motor engineering was starting to hit its peak. An era where life for some was just one big party whether from underground establishments from prohibition or money gained elsewhere into The Depression hit in October 1929 and Prohibition ended in 1933 when all that ended. You can't sit in this movie looking to nitpick every this or that. You have to enter this film knowing or wanting to enter a world...a time...different than our own for the two and half or so hours of this movies length. Five out of Five stars.I highly recommend this film (especially during the spring and/or summer months) and original Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald novel which has been one of my favorites since high school.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Would have wanted to see what happened after Lincoln's death.  It was an important time in our history and should have continued with thoughts from the new president.
B007RKPO84|5.0|Critics call the Scorpions the best German band. No effing way. Kreator is the best thing to come out of Germany since the wall came down. I have listened to them off and on for twenty years. Love these guys, love this album. Phantom Antichrist, United in Hate, and Civilization Collapse are the most classic thrash songs I have heard in a long time. If you like classic thrash then these German titans are a must buy.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Travis is a man whore and the exact type of guy that Abby does not need in her life. She does everything she can to repel Travis but ends up in a convoluted friendship with him  where the lines are blurry and feelings are undeniable. They end up in this explosive and tumultuous friendship/relationship.<br /><br />I have never been this conflicted on my feelings for a book. There were a lot of things that I didn't like about the book, more specifically the characters, but I was so enthralled and could not put this book down. First of all, I had real problems with Abby. I didn't like the way she strung Travis along and I felt like she acted all innocent but knew exactly what she was doing. She grew on my a little at the end but for most of the book, I was not a fan of her. I liked Travis but I didn't like that he was so possessive and temperamental. The way he acted every time he got mad or drunk really annoyed me.<br /><br />I did think that the book was well written and I liked the idea around the plot and how it was written out. She definitely did a good job of pulling out my emotions and feelings for the characters even if I was hating on them at the time. Overall, I think it was a decent book and well thought out and written. Unfortunately the characters where more hate-able than love-able for me and I couldn't help but be annoyed by them at times, even if I was enjoying the story behind it.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|Fun game with good graphics, but the game keeps clutching out on me. Today for like the third time the game reset itself and I lost all of my progress when I was up to the tiger shark. WTF?! If that were fixed, I would give 5 stars.
B001JU4S44|4.0|Not a Tom Cruise fan but still like the Mission Impossible series. Action packed but still predictable. Some of it seems unrealistic but still enjoyed it.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I like how they've mixed it up with Daniel Craig and showing a different side of the Bond character.  Hope to see more.
B0000062FL|4.0|One of Santana's first albums, containing some classic hit songs.  Perhaps the unique thing about Carlos is his ability to play a single note on his guitar and just hold the thing for an impossibly long time.  Thus, his playing has a searing quality to it which is fairly legendary in the world of rock music.  If you like his music, you pretty much have to get this album.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Another very long, convoluted read.  Not unpleasant but not in the same league as the first two books in the series.  Perhaps he is being paid by the page?<br /><br />I'm afraid he will never finish or at least arrive at some resolution for this series.  At best, he is just treading water with the enormous cast - much and more.  I hope GRR has the story figured out, so he can advance the plot in the next installment, whenever that may be.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I'm just leaving feedback for the well deserved 5 stars , anyone honestly that rated this low either should not have even played it or known this wasnt their type of game.. you don't rate a game bad just because it's to long or it's just not your type of game, read up and know what your in for before buying it!  As for my feedback everyone else layed down the best moments about this very fun \\"jrpg\\" no need for me to repeat what's already been said. If your vita has been collecting dust like mine has this will get you back in the game. Enjoy!! Also waiting for \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" and \\" Y's\\" .
0316069434|4.0|3 1/2 stars moving up to 4.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is in the unsolved crime unit with the approach of the 20th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots.<br /><br />He picks a case of Anneke Jespersen who was killed during the riots and Bosch wasn't able to give the case his full attention due to the riots.<br /><br />As he looks into the gang warfare that predominated the area at the time of the riots, he makes some headway but comes up against a major impediment. His superior is a controlling administrator who wants to know Harry's every move.<br /><br />Harry makes progress with the bullet casing of the gun and following the trail of the weapon makes the case move forward due to innovations in the 20 years after the murder.<br /><br />The suspense of the story mounts as Harry gets closer to answers while dealing with a possible Internal Investigation from his actions.<br /><br />The story seems to be realistic and I liked the way that Harry didn't give in to his egotistical supervisor.<br /><br />Connelly is known for the excellent conclusions to his novels and I felt that this story wasn't quite up to his past performances.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Old School is classic.  Must own.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Thank me later.  No excuses.  Best one-word quote:  \\"Inappropriate.\\"  (Early on in the movie - pay attention when coffee hits the dress).
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|I haven't get a chance to use it. So I don't have much to say about it. I will give it a chance hopefully very soon.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This was a great movie from beginning to end. We wouldn't usually watch movies with subtitles...but this was well worth it. Highly suggest this one!!
160774273X|4.0|For a beginner, and home bakers of all levels, this is a wonderful book and he goes into great detail on sourdough which is perfect.
0812993357|5.0|Came faster than I thought! Love the packaging! I'm a reader, i'll be shopping again! So excited to read my book! Hasn't left my side yet! Love tht new book smell!
B003N0XDT4|2.0|I read the reviews and I took the risk hoping that I would not get a dead battery. Once I plugged it in to my laptop the sound was amazing. Unfortunately, once I plugged it out and tried turning it on there was no response. Therefore, the product was defective. Such a shame to since the sound quality did amp up my Sennheiser HD 598s. I would honestly give this product 5 stars if the internal battery did actually charge.<br /><br />This was probably one of the first pieces of equipment I would buy to enhance my music aside from my Sennheisers. I guess I am what you would call an audiophile noobie since I'm just starting out. I was going to just keep this and maybe buy a portable headphone amp but I read the other reviews on here and it states that a lot of their products would eventually have a static sound when plugged into the amplifier. I don't want to take that risk. So if you're reading this then by ALL MEANS AVOID THIS PRODUCT!<br /><br />Aside from that, I am returning this item and buying a FiiO E07K Andes Portable USB DAC Headphone Amplifier as a replacement.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Much and more awesome. Six months of reading made for time well spent. Four down and three to go... Thank you, George R. R. Martin! A wonderfully constructed world full of amazingly developed characters!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Not Funny and after about 20 minutes you just hate the terrible parenting and the terrible movie. I could not finish it.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|There is nothing I dislike as of now. The reviews though are good. I am hoping for success. Thank you
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Easy read, very compelling, and a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />I look forward to more of it!! Excellent story, very dramatic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very addictive and my kids just love it I hope to buy more of these kinds of games in the future
B007SGM084|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a simple, yet entertaining read. It is very easy to follow the plot, the sexual scenarios are not to over the top and the price for all 3 books is not too steep.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This is a well told &#34;coming of age&#34; novel..  However, it is written in  a style that appeals to adults as well as teens.<br /><br />The author is a former Omaha World Herald columnist and the book has many local references.  This makes it appealing to readers in the Omaha market but it is certainly not limited to that market.<br /><br />It is an easy read and entertaining as well as providing an insight of the teenage culture.
0802473156|5.0|It came in good great looking condition. It is a nice cover.  Thank you very much. Have a good day.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I love how Jodi Picoult's books always have surprises in them! Somehow the characters are always connected in the end! This is definitely a book worth reading!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Nice graphics. Very reactive to screen tilt and the difficulty is such that you will keep coming back for<br />more. Haven't gotten far-but challenging enough to try to finish.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a really nice purchase!<br /><br />I bought it for my dad for Christmas.  It has a nice case and is nicely priced.
B000058BGV|5.0|What makes the great beauty and almost perfection of this version is, not only Karl Richter's musicality and profound knowledge of this music -he was an specialist in Bach-, but the dramatic intensity of the recitatives by Ernest Haefliger, who is the greatest Evangelist of the recording era. He gives unity to the whole work, through his narrative of utmost beauty, his solo laments of surpassing sadness, his moments of raging energy such as had never before heard in records. Unfortunately, the Jochum version in Philips -with Haefliger, even better than here- is not available. Richter's version is not as slow as Klemperer's, nor as fast as Gardiner's. The tempo, I think, is well balanced. The orchestra, chorus, soloists, everything is perfect here. Seefried is lovely as always, Fischer Dieskau, Kieth Engen, are in high form. The only handicap is the German mezzo Hertha Töpper's almost ugly voice and dry singing. If only Christa Ludwig or Janet Baker would have been instead!<br />Highly recommended.
0061743526|3.0|This was a gift for a friend for her birthday.<br /><br />It's a good book and she had wanted for it awhile.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good season, overall. The mental tolls inflicted start to add up, and a neighboring group's leader will stop at nothing to fulfill his aims. I did think a few points were dragged out a bit.
B003EY62II|4.0|This was a birthday gift for a friend.  She had been wanting it for a long time and it's hard to find these movies anywhere so I'm glad Amazon had it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It s nice game to play a bit everyday. When back home, at evenings, I see my city and improve it with fun )))))))
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Was recommended this by a friend and I'm super glad I read it.<br /><br />It pulls you in and you don't wanna put it down until you finish reading it all!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm hooked!  Love the show...and would have missed it if not for Amazon!  Thanks for the excellent quality, and delivery of this amazing series!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Was recommended this by a friend and I'm super glad I read it.<br /><br />It pulls you in and you don't wanna put it down until you finish reading it all!
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|It is amusing.  I like it.  A little bit difficult at the beginning but getting to know it now well.
B007SPPANM|5.0|Got this for a present for my grandmother after she enjoyed a trip to the Titanic museum.  She loved it.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|It is amusing.  I like it.  A little bit difficult at the beginning but getting to know it now well.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|This was a gift for a friend for her Christmas present.  She loves Sherlock Holmes so I was glad to find it on ebay whether than go out to a store and find it and pay a more expensive price.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|When I started reading, I was immediately drawn to Holder's character. I mean, I fell hard! Cute mysterious guy struggling with his emotions? What's not to like?! I even fell for the cutesy lines. Like, live, love... just plain a-ma-zing. Then the real suspense kicked in and it was SO good. Really caught me by surprise. Yet I honestly believe the author chose THE WORST moment ever to unite the characters in what should've been a \\"take your breath away\\", very sweet scene that came out to be so freaking creepy. Kind of ruined it for me. It was a good read if you surpass those details.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|The app works well for streaming music that I have purchased from Amazon. I really like how Amazon retroactively  has provided MP3s for CDs I have purchased in years past. I wish the app would keep up with Android's features like Jelly Bean's expanding notifications, but overall it is my goto streaming music player. I like it better than Google Music for Android. Now if only Amazon would release the Amazon Video stuff for non-Kindle Android.
B00422LESO|5.0|Austenland made me fall in love with all things Jane Austen all over again. Almost felt like I could relate to the character (which I guess it's not hard at all for any true Austen fan). The story was slightly unpredictable yet at the very end you're screaming for some predictability, a little happy ending of your own... and boy, it delivers! This book made me run for my P&P DVD (BBC and Colin Firth, of course). If you call yourself a fan of any of the books, it's a MUST.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put it down. I was surprised a third series book could keep my attention so well. After the second book, I could not begin to imagine the direction the story would take. I hope the movie series does the book justice!!
B007N6NGYG|2.0|I'm not that quick to change the tracks. The designer of this app. is probably very good and for a younger player this would be good.

B00BL5EQLC|5.0|Pros:<br />-Very nice and beautiful graphics<br />-Kind of a running game, but very unique<br />-Fun controls<br />-The best soundtrack in any game I have ever played on Amazon, even better than Cut the Rope and World of Goo<br />Cons:<br />-Very Hard, got stuck on level 7 and this is probably the thirtieth time I am trying it<br />-Controls aren't sensitive enough
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's good, it is the best book ever.... . . . . . . . . . . .......... . .  . . .

B002TEF5KK|5.0|I have rated this book too the highest rank because i think this book is an excellent book an it has all the real history about the shengoku period and also when the portugese had get an access to their land witch the japaneses didn't really like but they nedeed the trade and experience by the portugeses,this book is an excellent book for history lovers,and for just say it right out:i come from Norway and you can see that my english is not on the best level in the world but anyway thanks for reading my review on an fantastic book:Shogun;););)

B00B49L7JY|5.0|Impressed by the man as much as by his music.  Seemed to be grounded as very few people are.  I was touched that his daughters spoke so highly of him.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Quite a few jump out of your seat scares, and an overall creepiness from the two child actors. I've read the younger child did not speak English at the start of production which must have added a layer to her performance of being a feral child. The 'Mama' was scary as heck too, and i was NOT expecting the ending! I recommend it. It won't change your life, but it was a notch above most of the very mediocre horror movies we see nowadays.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is worth the price and the space it takes up!!! I deleted about 20 apps to get this. The attention to detail is amazing and your mission is never the same. Also this isn't the only GREAT GAMELOFT GAME THERE ARE MORE!!!!!!! So make shut you check them out!!!
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I haven't had the chance to use this product owing to personal circumstances (working in another city every second week to pay the bills) and now I've missed the return window. If you want kind of OK recordings accompanied by the roar of the ocean levels of hiss, then this product might be OK for you. Otherwise, think ten foot pole.<br /><br />A very disappointing product. And no, brand new batteries didn't fix it either.<br /><br />I'd sell it, except I couldn't look myself in the eye afterward. I wish Audio Technica had the same ethics.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I came late to The Walking Dead, I started watching during season 3.  I watched the first two seasons on Netflix and bought the first twelve episodes of this season here on Amazon.  I couldn't get enough!  I am sad that there is only one episode left, but look forward to next season!
B00632HWOG|3.0|when i first used this app, it worked so well and was so convenient for me that i would have given it a five star rating. however, ever since theyve updated and &quot;improved&quot; the app, changing around some features, it has been more of a hassle. i cant ever switch to other accounts with ease nor at all. when i open the notification on my kindle, it hardly ever opens to the right account. sometimes it doesnt even open the correct email. :( i know it isnt my kindle. it functions properly as it should, so i dont know why im having this trouble with the app. please fix these bugs soon. i loved my yahoo mail app :(!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Another GREAT book in the Miles Vorkosigan series.  Miles and his wife are in this one, but peripherally.  It's great to see stories of some of the other characters that we've come to love.  MORE of this series, PLEASE!!!!

0596007124|5.0|A really good introduction to design patters.  Each chapter is really wordy though, I would have liked to have a quick reference section where each design pattern was summarised for quick reference later.

B005LAII44|3.0|Let's be clear that \\"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\\" is an action movie based on a comic book and a toy action figure.  It features virtually non-stop action, some terrific special effects, and a comic book plot.  This is not \\"Patton\\" or \\"The Ten Commandments\\" or even \\"Die Hard.\\"  It is a fun, no-brainer movie in which the good guys eventually win and the bad guys eventually lose, but some of the bad guys escape to set up the next movie.<br /><br />As the movie opens, the GI Joes, an elite American special operations combat unit, are in action, securing some loose Pakistani nuclear weapons from insurgents in a superb action sequence inside a military facility.  However, the Joes are framed by the President, who is really an impersonator planted by the terrorist organization Cobra.  The fake President sends a military strike after the Joes, wiping out the unit.  The Cobra organization liberates its imprisoned leader and executes its clever plan to take over the world.<br /><br />Fortunately, three of the Joes survive the ambush in Pakistan.  Led by Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, they go underground, figure out the frame-up, and make contact with two key people: the ninja warrior Snake Eyes and a retired Joe, General Coulton.  Together, they will put together a plan to ambush Cobra at a nuclear weapons summit at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, of all places.<br /><br />The action sequences are quite good, including shoot-em-ups in Pakistan and at Fort Sumter, and a fantastic ninja sequence on a cliff in some remote and unnamed mountain range.  Bruce Willis has an excellent extended cameo as General Coulton, while Jonathan Pryce enthusiastically chews the scenery as a real and fake president.<br /><br />\\"G.I. Joe\\", underneath all the high tech weapons, martial arts, and special effects, is a good old-fashioned action movie.  Park your brain and enjoy the ride.
B00164GDD2|5.0|Good quality movie, fun for all, perfect night in to catch up on all oldie.<br />One to recommend to friends
B00915G6SU|5.0|\\"Criminal Minds\\" returned for its eighth season on CBS television in the 2012-2013 with a couple of cast changes and a terrific lineup of new cases, to be solved by the special agents of the FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit (BAU).  The storylines continue to be about unique criminal mindsets, delivered by an excellent ensemble cast with well-developed characters and dynamic teamwork.<br /><br />At season's begining, Special Agent Emily Prentiss moves on to a choice position with Interpol, to be replaced by FBI linguists expert Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn), who brings a new set of skills to the team and some significant baggage with Assistant Director Erin Strauss, who supervises the BAU.  Alex will have an immediate impact within the team, not least in assisting Dr. Spencer Reid in a relationship with a girlfriend he has never met face to face.  The girlfriend is being stalked by an unknown person, and her story arc will be dealt with over several episodes, climaxing in a traumatic confrontation between Reid and the surprising stalker.<br /><br />\\"Criminal Minds: The Eighth Season\\" continues to feature crime-of-the-week drama, in which the team flies off from FBI HQs to assist local law enforcement in tracking down a serial killer with unique psycological characteristics.  The storys involve emotionally wrenching elements and significant suspense, as the BAU races the killer or killer to his or her last victim.  Storys include insights into the lives of the team, from Hotchner's new girlfriend to Penelope's old boyfriend and much else.  There are no indications the show is running out of originality.<br /><br />A continuing narrative threat over the course of the season is the presence of an unknown subject who is stalking the team itself.  The unsub is first glimpsed by the audience photographing the team at work on cases.  He will eventually make his presence known baiting the team byh replicating crimes they have already solved, and by seeming to work with accomplices.  The team itself is vulnerable, in a way not seen since the Reaper went after Hotchner and his family in Season Five.  But you'll have to watch to find out what happens...<br /><br />\\"Criminal Minds: The Eighth Season\\" is highly recommended to its fans.ices.  The team itself is vulnerable, in a way not seen since the Reaper went after Hotchner and his family in Season Five.

020530902X|5.0|Strongly recommend to everyone who just needs to improve writing skills. This book is filled with gems and it is a real writer's bible.
B0095R6OBS|3.0|Made in the 70's it is obviously for small kids. The storytelling is a bit bland, the screenplay not really engaging. Saw it by mistake thinking it was the New animation film by the same name and director.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great! its fast and simple to use and it is a lot easier than pulling up a web page each time.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|I felt this was just your basic \\"run around and shoot-um-up\\" movie.  Very shallow<br />plot.  The main actor did a good job though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Powerful, smart, funny and sad it would be a crime  to have a chance to read this book and not read it. Do yourself a favor and indulge in this brilliant story.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|He is such a great actor. I really liked this movie, and it was a total surprise ending for me!  I don't see the need for the NUDE woman at the beginning of the film and the word F____ having to be used so many times.  It added nothing to the film.  In fact, that could have brought it down 2 stars for me.  But the overall movie I really enjoyed.
B005K17RU0|1.0|the old app was easy to update and showed the high and low for today right when opened. the new app is flashy sure but I have to hunt for today's high. nobody wants the graphs what value do they add? none! can you understand what they mean within tree seconds? no! fundamental rules of User interface design were broken with this new app. keep the new color scheme if you want but bring back the old interface! I am a die hard accuweather User and I love the far future forecasts but his app has made me decide to stop using it and find another app that actually tells me what I want to know. I can find out conditions right now by sticking my head out the window. nobody cares about conditions right now. we care about conditions throughout the day so we can decide what to do and what to wear. I'm so disappointed that you ruined the best weather app there was
B0016492BW|5.0|This is a classic movie that needed to be in my blu-ray collection. After all it's the holy grail. Thanks
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|enjoyed it the game. Good graphics and entertaining puzzles. Having the helper monkey was a nice twist. Well worth the .99 it cost.
B000EPE7AK|1.0|Doesn't work! Yes we bought this used, but it was pretty scratched up when we received it. We just tried to play it and our dvd player won't even read it. Pretty disappointed. We bought this for our kids for Easter and they were so excited to watch it this morning. Bummer.
0937381888|5.0|Great as an intro and as a reference. Covers almost everything you need to know as a home brewer. Opened a new chapter in my life.
1449410243|5.0|This book is HILARIOUS! I was laughing the whole time I was reading it! It gives you some really funny facts and a poster of the six ways on how to tell if your cat is plotting to kill you. One of the funniest books EVER!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Get it.  Some of the songs are too long IMO but still great.  They seem familiar yet entirely new.  Love it.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Enjoyed it a lot!!! Was fun and a must watch! Don't miss it. i hate that they make me add more words when i don't want to!!!!! LOL
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Received in excellent comdition.  Phil Collins' songs and cds will always remain classics.  I love all the songs and this is a keeper.  Brings back memories of the early days... :-)
B007G51UV0|2.0|The first 3 months of use this board produced some impressive results. It's loaded with features including WIFI. The onbopard audio produces crisp vibrant sound. There are more than adequate SATA connections. Running this system with an SSD drive, Core i7 CPU and 16 Gigs of ram produced an impressive gaming experience.<br /><br />I have been building systems for about 13 years and have always bought Asus boards for their reliability. This is the first one that has failed. This one failed after 3 months. The power LED comes on but no boot. After extensive troubleshooting I received approval for an RMA which I am told will take a minimum of 10 days.<br /><br />In order to avoid downtime, I purchased a replacement board which turned out to be DOA. This one boots and then hangs at VGA detection. A red LED comes on and the system cannot boot with onboard video or external video. All other components have been tested OK. After another call to tech support the second board is going back too. I am beginning to have some second thoughts after wasting another day off.  I cannot justify buying a third board on the chance that one will work.<br /><br />One board failing is understandable. Two is unacceptable. This has been a costly, time consuming and frustrating experience.
B000002IQ9|5.0|Received in great condition.  I love it and this is a classis and a keeper.  Love all the songs.  Enjoy!
B00BU2TEGS|3.0|I grew up as a HUGE Depeche Mode fan. And I still am. But these days I definitely find myself turning into that old guy on the porch, grousing about how it was better 'back in the day'. Their music just seemed much more inspired back when Dave was struggling with addiction and everyone's lives were teetering on the brink of collapse. It's awesome to hear them embracing some new sounds, and there's definitely some good tunes on here, but Depeche Mode just doesn't move me like they used to. They haven't rocked my world in a very long time, but I always find at least a couple of songs that I still enjoy in their releases. I'll always rock out to whatever they release, and I'll always support their tours, but it's just a little disheartening that it seems like their soul of creativity has run it's course.<br /><br />Ah well.
B000002IG4|5.0|Received in excellent comdition.  Phil Collins' songs and cds will always remain classics.  I love all the songs and this is a keeper.  Brings back memories of the early days... :-)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very enjoyable book for easy reading. The plot wasn't too involved. Somewhat predictable. This is the first Sparks book I have ever read and I will definitely read more. I really appreciate the fact that there was no cussing or explicit sex in the book. I usually only read Christian books because of this, but now have found a secular author I can enjoy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it I'm level 11 and I breeded a ground and a snow and I hope I get a rare one<br />I recemendit to all ages
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much, that i couldn't fall asleep until i finished it.  The author manages to weave so many different story lines together, that once one resolves, another more interesting one is well on its way.  The pace, and subject, and adventure are fascinating!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|A thrilling story! Could not stop once I got started. Can't wait for the movie! On the way to purchase Book three.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|This is a perfect game for those who like the Mario style of adventure... collecting silver bars and ducking under things constantly testing your mental and reactive skills... it is fun and challenging.. easy to play for young and old alike... (6 years to 100+)
0802473156|5.0|Whether you're in a terrible, ok, good, or fantastic relationship, every couple should read this book. It never hurts to keep improving your relationship, and couples should always strive to please each other.<br />I bought this book as part of a wedding gift and decided to pick one up for my boyfriend and I as well. I'm giving this book to every newlywed couple from now on!
B0074VA2T2|5.0|How much fun can you have with flashcards ... a lot... this is the type of game you can spend hours with your kids or grandchildren learning math while enjoying the pleasure of each others company... easy to use and clear labeling make this a no nonsense tool for the young mind.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Definitely it is a fun game. Most levels are way too easy. And some levels cannot be beaten without the use of bombs. Been waiting for an update to fix but I broke down and bought bombs. Maybe that was the developers intentions. All finished now and waiting on an update for more levels.
B005COO1X6|4.0|This is classic Stephen King. His short stories are my favorite. This story is Christine with a dash of Stand By Me thrown in. The story is quick and dirty, but filled with tons of heart and horror.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|The one hundred-year-old man who is the protagonist of this novel is known as Allan and he has, we learn, done a lot more than merely climb out the window of his ‘Old Folks Home’ and disappear. Allan contends with his fear of dying in an institution, the disabling repercussions of old age as well as the consequence of stealing a lot of money from a criminal bikie gang.<br /> Jonasson explores the domino effect of international politics and the way it led to the wars of the last century. A major theme of the book examines the way in which humans habitually forget the value of other human life, but cling dearly to their own individual existence.<br />Structurally, the book is well written. Jonasson uses chapters to separate the two chronologically ordered plots, one – his past life – spanning a century, the other – his life as a retiree on the run – covering no more than a fortnight. Yet both carry equal weight in the book.<br />To say that a novel is almost indigestibly plot-packed is not a criticism; I could have refrained from using the word almost. This is a fast-paced novel that covers a lot of fictional terrain, which is the where the strength of the book lies; it is  action-packed and makes for an addictive single-sitting read.<br /> This novel is also very funny. Jonnason’s comedy relies on understatement and satire, which is layered and reiterated for effect. The way he zooms through a large chunk of history and manages to slot his protagonist in at every stage is skillful. However, there comes a point at which all of these chance encounters with Allan become difficult to believe. Through the comedic nature of this novel, Jonasson makes his skillfully crafted Twentieth Century history lesson appear facetious; and that being the case, also pedantic.<br />  This novel is written for those readers looking for an enjoyable read that doesn’t require too much thinking. Although we glimpse a few beautiful sentences here and there, the majority of thetime the importance lies in what is being said, rather than how it is described; which makes the few glimpses of pleasurable prose stand out like gems.<br /> For half the novel, in which Allan has escaped and is on the run from bikies, the book is set in Sweden. Unfortunately we are given such a small amount of description in which to visualise this landscape, that the only prompts alerting us to the local setting are the strange place names. It would appear as though Jonasson had not expected an international readership. The book could be greatly improved if more visual details were included so that the non-Swedish readership get a deeper glimpse of that country.<br /> Jonaason’s characterisation and structure is tight and effective. His well-planned plots come together to make a very enjoyable story about modern history, old age, and not taking life too seriously.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I got this as a FAOD,,,and am quite pleased with it. Some levels require lots of thinking while others are a bit easier to get through. This &#34;mix&#34; makes the game more fun.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This is great!!  I love using this instead of my iphone because it is so much larger and easier to see.  Still a little bit of a navigation problem but hopefully I can get around that.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book!  I'm really glad that I didn't start it until the entire series was complete though because each book leaves you begging for more!

B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This is a really good CD.  It was a great purchase.  There were some songs I didn't really care for though like 'In Your Room' and 'American Boys'.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I like this better than your bubble burst game.  At least it is way more interesting to play and moves quicker.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The Seasons, I feel, are a little harder than the regular Angry Birds.  Which I guess is good for those who want a challenge.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is a really good book.  And I'm really glad that I didn't read it until the next few came out because once you finish this one, then you automatically want the next one.

B00684J49U|5.0|I love Grey's Anantomy!<br /><br />But this season leaves you at an awful cliffhanger (as do most of the other seasons).  I don't watch the seasons til they come out on DVD so I can watch the episodes back to back.  But I've already heard 'gaspy' things about season nine.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am addicted to this game.I play it every day. As a adult fan of the My Little Pony friendship is magic show, I find this game a nice little companion to the show. My kids also like to play it. I only wish there were more mini games than just the ball toss and Apple catch.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|A lot of people don't like Twitter, but I mostly use it it to follow my favorite authors which comes in handy when you wanna know about their new books!

B00B29J0I6|4.0|Fun game that requires some problem solving skills. I would recommend for ages 9 and up since it can be frustrating for those with limited patience.
0316069884|5.0|This book goes into a lot of detail about the different ways in which animals are farmed for human consumption thus it is a great educational book. All meat eaters should read it to make sure they understand what happens to the animals that they eat and make sure it fits with their ethics over eating animals. Vegetarians/vegans can also learn a lot from this book - if nothing else but to give them the resources to help defend themselves when meat eaters start to question.
030758836X|4.0|No one in this book is likeable.  Of course I had to finish it and find out what happened.  [Spoiler alert!  Oh, I guess I did that with the title and first sentence of the review.]  I found a typographical error and that didn't help.  Go ahead and read it because everyone else is reading it and you don't want to be left out.  When done, donate it to your local library.
0316227706|5.0|Have seen the book before and wanted it as a coffee table book. Has lived up to expectations with visitors!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender`s Game is a fast read. The first time I read it, I read through in 20 hours. I was married at the time so I had the time.<br /><br />If your looking for a secret truth. you probably skipped over it the first you read it. Influence is not the same as power, but it's close enough. There is a few more to find. You'll know when you find them.

B008HK3XKO|4.0|The Marware Vibe Standing case arrived at my home a few weeks ago. I managed to easily fit it to my Kindle Fire Hd and found it was exceedingly smart. I chose a black one. It came reasonably quick and has many features. I found it could stand up so watching films or typing on the wireless keyboard was easier. It had a strap for sleep mode, and was easy to pack away into my school bag. It looked like a book therefore reduced the risk of it getting stolen. This case is far better then cases I have brought for other tablets/e-readers and was money well spent. :)
B00BJNHACS|5.0|Super fun.  Worth a dollar for sure.  Creative racing game.  It's hard to find good games but this one is fun

B00B2V66VS|5.0|People think that when you buy it, it won't work, just because it's free..... I bought it and started to love the game.... it works fine.  AND IT WAS FREE AND WORKED... now I am addicted to this game. It is so fun so BUY IT NOW and you won't be sorry that you did. :)
B0094BB4TW|3.0|So there was an update.. I don't seem to like it as much. Its slower and it has to many errors and for my notification updates take forever and when I need to see my profile it takes forever too. I like the last one better..
1451695195|5.0|If you've ever found yourself wondering about the mysteries of the possibility of Life after Death...this should help you decide
B009VB7QQA|4.0|It had a lot of action and the special effects were first rate.  I know it is difficult to accomplish in a short film, but the personal relationships among the central characters seemed to be sacrificed for cramming more action into the film.  Even with that disappointment, the cinematography was excellent, the story palatable and the players enthusiastic.  Worth a look.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|My 10 year old pentium 4 with the original intel cooler and thermal tape was running 140 degrees streaming video..I removed the old Intel tape and rock hard paste. Then I applied a thick coat of arctic silver [spread all over the top] and my processor is down to 120 degrees in a room 78 degrees..102 degrees just surfing the web.[Intel Active Monitor, a free download at intels website] I cleaned everything with CRC Contact Cleaner and Coffee Filters.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever made, especially of ones that involve zombies.  This series really deviates from the traditional zombie genres because they put much larger emphasis on what survivors need to do in order to continue surviving in this new world and explores the dangers of other people as well.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|The facts surrounding the actual cause of Sixto Rodriguez's death caused a pair of music industry insiders to seek out the truth: the facts were unknown. Rodriguez had simply disappeared from the earth as far as anyone knew. There were stories about his suicide on stage during a concert, a prison death, among other things, but no one knew how he'd actually died, and since he'd never been really popular in the U.S. during his career, the mystery didn't really begin to pique interest in the filmmakers until they realized that, though he'd been from Detroit when he released his albums in the 70's, he'd never made much of a splash in the U.S., but his following in Apartheid-ravaged South Africa had been massive. How, then, they wondered, did he simply disappear?<br /><br />The legends of his demise created a puzzle the filmmakers had to work through to find out what had happened to Rodriguez. Could he have actually committed suicide onstage? Did he die in prison?<br /><br />The truth they found out is a heartwarming revelation and a study in humility and modesty that is sure to satisfy the viewer. I saw this movie in the theater and left the viewing very moved by the man and his story. His humble, simple nature is an example to us all. His music was a wonderful mixture of Dylan and Jackson Browne for its writing and political timeliness, Croce and Cat Stevens for its storytelling and fluid melodies and his voice has a purity and crispness much resembling the great Freddy Fender.<br /><br />This is one of those movies, so few and far between these days, that make spending ten dollars to see it in a theater money well spent.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|tried repeatedly to use on my kindle. took. 10 minutes for opening screen sequence then force close. don't bother on kindle
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Others have written some excellent reviews, so I will keep this short. Love that it doesn't just yell &#34;expensive camera equipment enclosed&#34; to those not in the know, that it has a nice padded compartment for an iPad or notebook, and that it is well constructed.  The little zipper tabs that say &#34;Amazon Basics&#34; in black and orange are well made and work well, but they are, well, orange.  Good thing I am an SF Giant's fan.  Still, fantastic for the price.
0307346617|5.0|Once I started reading I couldnt put it down. You can tell how much of his heart, work.& time was taken creating this brilliant masterpiece.my only disappointment was realizing I was near the end. Amazingly written, bad ass tale of world war z
B00530FC6O|5.0|Light, funny, a fast read that models the power of humor and character to overcome human foibles. The plot provides a display case for behavior - the kind of behavior that could be called &#34;good&#34; postmodernism.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|Great Movie.  To me this may be the most humorous of the star trek movies.  Then again I may have had too much LDS back in the sixties.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Interesting perspective on a complicated person. There needed to be more on the relationships he had over his life and his marriage.
B000I3UMLQ|5.0|Great Movie, fun characters, fun plot, and very well made.  If I have one criticism, it is that there is not enough cow bell in this one.
0525952926|5.0|Even better than the first. Don't be intimidated by the number of pages, I couldn't put it down. It's on my top list of favorites for sure
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love how it has a sleep timer that will play my favorite songs over and over. I wish that I could load more than two songs though.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I don't often write reviews about movies on Amazon but this one deserves my time to write one and your time to watch it.  Other reviews cover the subject matter better than I could.  I just know I was very moved by this film and give it my highest recommendation.
B0028RXXE8|4.0|both my husband and I really liked this series.  We like anything that is back in those days.  It didn't disapoint us in any way. Once you start to watch it you won't want to stop.
B0086700CM|4.0|Tried playing this on my Itouch, too small, on my ipad too big as far as being able to manipulate the screen.  The kindle screen is perfect for me to get a feel of the board and play more.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This a great game. Nice way to pass waiting times at doctor's appointment, or riding the bus or subway.  Would definitely recommend to others.<br />Nice graphics, plenty of game formats.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I have had their song in my head for a while and could not pass up the chance to get a listen to their LP for a nice price.  A nice mixture of folk, rock, and pop.  Very much looking forward to hearing them again.
0385523912|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is even slightly curious as to the nature of North Korean life. Being one of the most isolated countries in the modern world, Barbara Demick does an excellent job creating narratives of a few ordinary North Korean defectors of various lifestyles.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Enjoyed their performance on the Grammys this year and the previous ones.  They are constant and tight with their music and hope that they continue rocking out.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|This movie sucked, weak plot, over exploited the 80's Sunset Strip rock scene. I have no idea why such a movie was even made
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Where did the woman named Brittany Howard come from! It was an absolute pleasure to watch her share the stage with the Legendary Mavis Staples.  That guttural voice that brings a chill when I listen is what singing from the soul is all about.  Looking forward to the next CD which I will purchase as will as download.  This is what gets played on the stereo full blast Sunday afternoon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it. Excellent quality, really 16 more words! This is insane if I only have 2 great words to say that should be fine

0446560065|4.0|I bought this book for my mother for her birthday. She has two cats and page for page she can relate to every thing &#34;Simon's cat&#34; does. The only reason its not a 5 star is that some of the comics get old but they're still funny.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A fun trip though history.  A pleasant view of human kindness, treachery and cunning.  This film is good for all ages, however best enjoyed by mature audiences.
B008Y73940|4.0|M McCon did a great job as the lawyer & storyline was great...very believable swcenarios and supporting actors/actreesses also very good job.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Though I am a published writer knowing how to prepare a Kindle book was beyond me. \\"Building Your Book for Kindle\\" simplified it enough for me (I'm technologically challenged).
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters in this book.  As always it was exciting to the last page. I haven't regretted any Baldacci book have ever picked up.
B002LB13SE|3.0|Okay spoilers;<br /><br />- Good acting all around<br />- Didn't like the fact that the scenario seemed to imply \\"hey kids!  Smoke weed and you'll be raped and murdered!\\"<br /><br />And the ending.....<br /><br />- Dude; frying someone's brains for like 15 seconds is far from the most torturous ways to kill someone.  At least shatter a couple of limbs!!! (see also \\"7 days\\")<br /><br />- So are we suppossed to think they get away with all of this?  They probably could have except fot the fact that they obviously tortured Krug and killed him when he was no longer a threat.  The other two were obvously killed in a struggle.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I really liked it· I gave it four stars because it made me do a review· But it is okay·
B000HKYA1I|3.0|Think of the return of the eternal return from philosophy and you'll get more out of this flick. The story development doesn't necessarily flow but the refugee familial return to a fix point in time would make Doctor Who proud.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Great story, great performances and very entertaining.  A beautiful story about friendship. Highly recommend watching this movie. Rent it now!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|What a great game!  If you like the Nancy Drew games, you will love this.  I can not wait for the next one!  Best part is you can play a little first before buying the full game.  I was hooked!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Tigers, monkeys, zebras oh my!  Life of Pi is visually stunning, entertaining and well worth the watch.  It even leaves you with a little commentary on god, purpose and truth.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The best art has a backstory of sacrifice and hardship and Mel Gibson's work of art, The Passion of the Christ has such a backstory.  In 2003, Passion producer Mel Gibson, was accused of every sort of malice from the Hollywood elite that is hostile to this movie, Christianity, and Western Civilization in general.<br /><br />The movie is the story of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and it is filmed in a color tone that reminds the viewer of a Renaissance painting of the same subject.  It is also unique in that the dialogue is spoken in Latin and Aramaic, the languages of the time.  Greek is left out although it was the lingua franca of the Eastern Roman Empire.<br /><br />The movie make a point to emphasize the various smaller Saints that were part of the story.  For example, Pontius Pilatus' wife, an Orthodox Saint, is favorably featured.  An Ethiopian servant is also shown as receptive to the message of Christ.<br /><br />The movie is graphic, torture and blood is featured, however the affair is artfully done.  Violence, after all is a major part of art.<br /><br />Most movies pushed from Hollywood is nothing more than \\"dreck,\\" but this work is high art melding the classic works of da Vinci, Albrecht D&uuml;rer, Rembrandt, and Michelangelo with the modern medium of cinema.  This movie should be shown on Network TV every Good Friday.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is very funny and I really liked it. It is a very good book and I would recommend it.
B009AMAGQM|2.0|How could the authors let this happen?! They didn't keep anything from the book and changed everything and made it confusing and stupid instead of romantic and awesome! I saw this on my birthday and I was SUPER excited to see it. But when I finally did, I was pissed off and disappointed about how the film turned out. Even my mom and sister hated it! If I wasn't there with my mom and my sister, they said they wouldn't get ANYTHING. They were confused the entire time and I had to explain to them what was going on the whole time I was watching the movie. I was thinking \\"Thank God I read the book\\".<br /><br />  After the movie, I literally started to sulk around my apartment because I was so depressed with how the movie turned out. The book is still my favorite book of all time, but I will always HATE the movie. The only reason why I'm giving this 2/5 stars instead of 1 is because they did 2 things right. They did GREAT casting for the movie and the special effects was great as well. But that's about it. But even if you didn't read the book, you'd probably still hate it like the rest of us.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say about this wonderful series?<br />This family has taken up residence in my heart.<br />I hope they are around FOREVER.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Great way to keep in touch with friends and family<br />.I got on because my family is spread all over the country<br />and I needed to keep in touch with them. The games are<br />very expensive if you don't have a lot of friends on Facebook.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|A complete waste of time - i too kept reading thinking it would get better, alas no, it only got worse. How does nonsense like this get published? Plot (if you can call it that) was ridiculous with so many flaws I stopped counting.As as I remember the murder didn't even happen on the Cote d'Azur as the title suggests but in Atlanta, but maybe I missed something as i was skipping pages toward the end to get the pain over with quickly. Did any one actually read or edit this before it was released? I know it's fiction but you do need basic facts and characters to be at least a tiny bit believable.Glad it didn't cost anything, and thanks for the free warning - I will make sure i do not purchase anything in the future written by this so called author.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't know how I would survive without Kindle,<br />having it available  on my tablet means I can take it with me<br />everyware
1423136802|5.0|this is an awesome price for this collection. I paid $7 for just one book and returned it to buy this
B0064X7FVE|2.0|this program has a lot of problems.<br />I don't use it much. I mostly use my local news<br /> site for weather information.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|this movie is great. it was a good price..it's new in package. We are very happy with this movie and shiping
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great resource tool. Whenever I go to this site I find interesting projects and receipts.<br />Love it!
B006CDCWDM|5.0|I suggest this for every tennis fan. If you were not a Rafa fan before reading this you will become a fan for life.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|10*s. I borrowed this movie from my local library to watch and I am ready to give my opinion.<br /><br />WOW.....This movie really blew me out of the water. It followed the book, Hunger Games, very closely and it was just amazing!! It was just so awesome seeing this book turned into a movie and how well the graphics and the simulations were done. Just so extremely exciting and amazing. I am for sure going to be ready to see the book come to life on the big screen.
B001EBV0P8|5.0|The greatest film of all time.<br /><br />Seriously, if I watched it yesterday on TV and it came on today, I'd sit an watch it again.  If there was a Shawshank Redemption marathon, there you would find me, waiting for the moment Andy Dufraine pays it all back.  Yeah Bitches.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Outstanding graphics and special affects.  Watched it via Amazon prime over a wireless connection in HD and the surround sound was great as well as the graphics and it never skipped or buffered once
0345509617|5.0|I'm bias since this is my favorite movie, but this book was worth every penny. The concept art from the different artists was inspiring and gave me that feeling of wonder and awe again like when i watched this movie for the first time as a child. And there's a number of set photos that really capture the fun and energy that made this movie so successful. If you're a fan you will love this book.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|The game is fun... but it takes for EVER to get upgrades.  I don't like that after the first couple of upgrades I have to play like 50 times before getting another one.  and I'm not even close to getting all of the upgrades.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was very well written, and it's so addictive that you can't stop reading. Truly, a very good book.
B008220D5K|5.0|I think a lot of people who view \\"This Is 40\\" are missing the point.  It's not about turning an arbitrary age or crudity but about relationships at a crossroads.  Despite the turmoil in their lives Pete(Paul Rudd) and Debbie(Leslie Mann) genuinely love each other and are willing to wade through the muck because they are genuine soulmates.  The lewdness of Judd Apatow's film may turn some off and some even say this film is depressing.  All I can say is that I'm fast approaching 50 and I don't think there are many among us who didn't have some imperfect moments.  Apatow has managed here to mine the poignancy beneath the mess.  This film probably has one of the best ensembles of any comedy last year noteworthy are Megan Fox who sends up her sex kitten image and Albert Brooks as Pete's mooching dad.  Kudos as well go out to Maude and Iris Apatow who are quite natural child actors even if there is a hint of nepotism in their casting(they are Apatow and Mann's real life children).  Can't wait to revisit Pete and Debbie at 50.  Grandchildren!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|My 10 year old read this and he is ready for the next book! He was excited about reading it.
B002361MLA|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but this book is different.  I am presently reading it for the 2nd time as it has impacted my life in a very positive way.  My family and I have been experiencing very difficult situations recently but I have been able to hold on strong with the help of this book.  When becoming angry or emotional, I used to feel unsettled for a least 3 days.  My mind would continually re-live the events and I was full of worry.  Now, as soon as a troublesome event presents itself, I stop myself from getting swept in the emotions by first listening to my breathing and centering on my inner self.  I can then react in a positive way as I automatically see the situation in a different light.  I now try to stop my mind in re-living and imagining events.<br />I found the concepts very difficult to understand at first but kept on reading and it started to make a lot of sense.  Now, I am reading it for the 2nd time and practicing this art of staying in the present. It's not easy but when I succeed, I feel this great contentment and happiness.<br />I sincerely recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a good book!<br /><br />A friend told me about it before the movie came out and I was hesitant to read it.  Very glad I did, I had a hard time putting it down.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Read this book after seeing it mentioned UN the WSJ.  Has some slow spots, but, overall, a captivating read! Didn't take long at all to finish. Looking forward to future installments if the story.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This has become my default method for charging the Nexus 10 to protect the usb port from damage.  The magnets work well to hold it in place, you just slide it along until it finds the right spot and it clicks in.  It actually feels like it was made by Samsung themselves, good quality.<br /><br />Please, whomever you are that makes this, make a dock as well!  Samsung really dropped the ball on supporting this device and if you put this magnetic into a stand I know you'd sell at least one.
B00000ITOY|5.0|I thought this was a Melissa & Doug product when I bought it, but it's not.  While I was disappointed about that, it is a wonderful toy!  It's all painted wood, bright colors, toddler friendly, hearty, and everything else I was looking for.  Plus my son LOVES it.
B009JEM1PK|5.0|its got a bit of everything the slow doom some fast crushing, beautiful parts, parts that rip your eyes out, a great cd start to finish, my dying bride never disapoints
B009AMANBA|3.0|I expected a lot more out of this film after all the hype and rave reviews. The movie covered just a few months of Lincoln's presidency (focuses on the 13th amendment). For the price of a rental, it is worth it. However, I am glad I didn't buy the movie or pay more to see it in the theater.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this app is very helpful with finding accurate tempuratures and such. it even lets u see hourly, 36 hours, or 10 days in advance of the current date. if you like to keep in touch with up to date information, get it by all means.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good read.  Had hard time putting it down to go to bed.  Perfect ending.  One of those stories that makes you feel good when you have finishedit.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app is super easy to use anyone could use it! There are no instructions that i know  of but it was so simple i could figure it out in a matter of minutes. please buy! it is totally worth it,
B000IDEQTK|4.0|This is a well done story line with depth in the characters. Most of the acting is done very well and the one person in the cast that isn't great was endearing enough to draw me into the story anyway. Something can be learned from this move that will apply to any marriage today. We all fear the worst and keep things from those we love. The out come might seem better in the short term but that is exactly how the crack in a relationship start. This movie is a good reminder that once doubt is in play how quickly the pit can swallow us up.
0307949486|3.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo explores the mystery of the Vanger family and has an intriguing plot worthy of a thriller. However, author hasn't developed the main characters Mikael and Lisabeth in depth and they are less interesting than the Vanger family members. At around the same time, I read Carlos Ruiz Zafron's The Shadow of the Wind and the writing in the latter was much more enjoyable than Stieg Larsson's novel. I read the English translations of both novels, so the difference could result from the translators' skills. Even with these flaws, I recommend The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for readers interested in plot-driven novels.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It hit the ground running and never stopped.  Great characters!  It's compelling cross-over fiction so adults pass it on to your teens, they will love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good horse game considering it's free. Wish there was a bit more hands on care of the horse though. Could also use more non-premium items.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this has been great fun on my kindle. my kid loves mythology so she's. been loving it. better than around the world which I got stuck o. day 78 without any guidance.
0385537816|5.0|love these books, they are amazing...and keep you wanting to come back to read the next page, the next chapter....bummer its only three books..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book keeps in suspense from the very first page to the last. I thought that it is just a romance but no, when the action started I wasn't able to put this book away and just had to finish it. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy love stories with some dose of mystery.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Just as good or better than our IPAD!  Got it for my daughter for her birthday.  Was going to get the 7 in fire but for 60 bucks more got the bigger one. Its so vivid and bright.  Cant wait to borrow it to read a book.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|Smart, well written drama. Characters  are well defined, and the scripts are current. I recommend that you watch the series from the beginning.
B001CHXUPC|2.0|Although Amazon was above and beyond in cost/delivery/shipping, this model was...........it sucked!  The molding was questionable at best, many gaps that needed filling on the fuselage, the interior was about as barren as you could get, and the decals were almost impossible to separate from the backing even after 5 minutes of soak time.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|Certain liberties were taken with details. Perhaps I'm a quasi-purist, but I tend to think that  - when telling a story - it should be told with accuracy and attention to detail. And another thing, does it seem to anybody else that to take a book that is only as long as &#34;Fellowship of the Ring&#34; and make it into a movie as long as the entire &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy is a cheap, money grabbing technique?
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I always really liked/enjoyed this movie......now I like/enjoy it even more in 3D...a good job of rendering 3D to this film was accomplished.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of those books I couldn't put down.  A great story with a surprise twist at the end. Must read for all Nicholas Sparks fans!
B000MKD9P6|2.0|The credit sequence for \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a montage of young women putting on designer clothes like they're girding themselves for battle. They are the officemates of heroine Anne Hathaway, who is shown donning a chunky sweater. The motif continues with the young amazons eating elaborately prepared low-cal breakfasts while Hathaway wolfs down a bagel. This sequence is brilliant filmmaking because it establishes in just a few shots without a word of dialog that \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a science fiction film that takes place in a parallel universe in which Anne Hathaway is not a willowy beauty who looks more like a fashion model than anyone else in this movie.<br /><br />Hathaway plays a just-graduated aspiring journalist who breaks into the magazine world with a thankless job as an assistant to a boss-from-hell editor of a major New York fashion magazine, Meryl Streep, playing a not-even-thinly disguised Anna Wintour. At first Hathaway is hapless and bullied, but she gradually comes into her own in the fashion world, along the way risking the loss of her friends and her integrity. As workplace drama this is enjoyable enough, and Meryl Streep once again proves that she is great in everything, but as visual shorthand for this transformation Hathaway starts the movie as dumpy and gradually transforms into a glamour queen. We know this because of that opening sequence, and because in the first half of the movie Streep and others keep referring to her as \\"dumpy\\" even though the audience can clearly see that she is stunningly beautiful. Of course it's a convention that female film characters are played by actresses who are too attractive for their roles, but by making beauty a central theme, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" takes suspension of disbelief to a whole new level. Hathaway looks like Anne Hathaway. She is more chic than anyone around her. For good measure her boyfriend is played by Adrian Grenier, aka [[ASIN:B006GLPA8O Vincent Chase]]. The filmmakers don't even bother to put Hathaway's hair up and slap a pair of glasses on her. \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" aims for frothy, but ends up surreal.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read.  5 stars for being real and genuine .  Didn't sugar coat subjects and objectives. Talked about subjects and terms that are taboo to military guys. No political agenda.  He could have cut us Army guys some slack though .  Airborne
B009POCG2C|4.0|Expectations are high when an Eastwood film is released, and he never disappoints.  His films are always a balance of entertainment, decency and characters with a good heart.
B00466HN72|4.0|We bought the combo disc for my son.  Mush to my surprise, the DIGITAL COPY (for iTunes) has expired - at the time of this review!!  THAT SUCKS...  As for the the DVD and BluRay I am am happy.  Now we have to spend more money at the iTunes Store...
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|After playing catch up to see Season 1, I was hooked with Season 2. The changing roles of the players kept my attention. Now I can watch these in sequence or select episodes whenever I wish. The special episodes are included as well. Great price for a wonderful addition to my CD collection.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The tablet version looks nicer than the phone version, so that's a plus.  However, it is really choppy/laggy compared to the phone version (comparison made between the Kindle Fire 8.9&quot; HD and the HTC One X).  If they fix the lag I'd give it a higher score.  I do like how it's connected to Facebook and allows you to load the same park or load other accounts across multiple devices, that is an awesome feature I wish other games had.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of the best books ever. I would not recommend it to anyone below the age of 10 because of some rather gory details and scenes. I can not wait to read the next book, because this book ends in just the wrong place.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is really neat. It is a game for all ages between 3 and12.The graphics are really well to.My opinion is you should get it. One thing is it takes awhile to load the first time but after that it loads pretty fast.<br />'<br />If you like this post yeah and you will get a suprise that I give you but I only check once a week.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|Minutes To Midnight Is A Good Cd, I Will Admit. It's Nothing NOTHING compared to Hybrid Theory or Meteora though. The big songs are Given Up, What I've Done, And Leave Out All The Rest. In my Opinion this would've been a great way to end their career and it should've been the last album. Although they went to make the god awful Thousand Suns album. Rundown, good but not great. I give it 3 out of 5 and its being generous.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Love this recorder and I am always amazed at the quality.<br />I don't use 1/3 of what this this can do, multi track and such, but as a field recorder it's great. The dual jacks (XLR & 1/4) are a great way to save space and save having to take adapters along.<br />The body is a big upgrade from the H4, the menus are better. Overall quality is way way up. It now feels like a $300 tool.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Just an amazing story that shows the true artist & how humble he was. Humble: An admirable quality that not many people possess. It means that a person may have accomplished a lot, or be a lot but doesn't feel it is necessary to advertise or brag about it; I use that definition concerning this artist. If you are looking for a story about a victim you will not find it in this movie.

I was enthralled from book 1 to book 2 and I can't wait until Entwined, what will she think of next now that Eva's past has been dealt with. Will Eva's ex come into play. This is a must read, your reading collection is not complete until you have read about Gideon Cross.

1451648537|5.0|Just what this book needed. Yet, another review. But I had to write one because I felt so incredibly energized by Jobs' story. It was as much a life lesson as it was a biography of an incredible visionary and creative genius who ruled the kingdom of Apple with guts, instinct, and brute emotion. Some will read this book and remember how he created a company that created products that literally changed the world. Others will remember the tyrannical episodes that underscored his sometimes harsh leadership tactics. But that's not what stood out to me.<br /><br />I will remember a man who achieved great success by not only learning from failure, but leveraging it to propel himself to an amazing level of success. The man was so charismatic he sold me a MacBook from the pages of a book, when he said \\"I think you still have to think differently to buy an Apple computer. The people who buy them do think different. They are the creative spirits in this world and they're out to change the world. We make tools for those kinds of people...a lot of people think they're crazy, but in that craziness we see genius.\\" I read this and thought--he created Apple for me. It's not just a functional product, it's a form of creative expression. And after kind of wanting one for years, I now MUST have one. And the fact that he was responsible for the creation of Pixar and so many movies I love (and own)...well...that was just the icing on the cake.<br /><br />I highly recommend this read for anyone who wondered if they could be successful by doing what they loved even though it's unconventional and out of step with the norm, doggedly persevering despite failure, and following their gut instinct even with a choir of doubters saying \\"No, you can't.\\" Steve Jobs would say yes...as long as you're brutally honest about what sucks and fix it until you get it right.
0060090367|3.0|I have read a few books by Marian Keyes and for the most part, really enjoyed them. Surprisingly, I found this one to be a bit more amateurish. While predictable, the style of the book seems to improve towards the end. There were a few lines that I found really funny, but the story was overall not as compelling as I expected it to be.
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|The series rates 5 stars, but this packaging rates 1 star.  I bought this thinking I would get extra material from the 3 volume set, but it's just Seasons 1, 2, and 3 thrown together. Buy each one individually and save yourself $13.

B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Daniel Day Lewis' performance is truly sublime, perfect. Because of him, this film had vast potential but it was largely wasted because of the director. Spielberg can't make a great film, he just doesn't have what it takes and he relapses endlessly into schmaltz. Instead of running with Lewis' genius, he runs over it. The film unfolds like an 11th grade lesson in political science replete with corny music rising after every 'impassioned' speech. Spielberg is like a chef given the finest ingredients on Earth who then mixes them with hamburger helper. The product is bland and flavorless. What a shame.

B005LAII44|3.0|Overall the main storyplot is the standard over generic drama where the hero's are decimated and now it's up to the survivors lead by a saddened sub commander to rally them back from the brink of defeat to save the world and defeat the bad guys. What's laughable is some of the actors shown in the trailers only have small camera time in the actual movie it was almost like why bother at all, I guess they were hoping one name shown Bruce Willis would help bring in more movie goers but I doubt it really helped at all.Also the script for the movie was halfway bland to over the top in stereotypical one liners and speeches heard so many times in other movies or t.v. shows you can't help but think \\"That's it!?!??!! that's the best these Hollywood writers could do??!??!\\"<br /><br />I'm amazed to say this but while I didn't think the first movie was great it actually surpasses this one. I can't fault the actors or actresses in the movie as they played their roles as well as possible considering the director and writers of the movie but it's still sad to see for fans of the 80's cartoon to see their favorite characters reduced to this.I say if just wait for the movie to come to dvd and when at a reasonable price go ahead and add it to your collection if you already have the first one,but if you haven't seen the first movie at all do yourself a big favor and pass on its less then spectacular sequel.

B005GY0Y8S|1.0|This book is written in a very amateur-like style. Things don't make sense - such as the heroine of this book comes to France to find her sister, who had a baby out of the wedlock, but she herself has an intercourse with a guy she met maybe a couple days before. There are numerous prejudices and stereotypes, making the heroine look very superficial, intellectually challenged and impulsive (was that really necessary?). Very difficult to sympathize with someone so bigoted and vain.  Reinforces stereotypical (and very unkind) image of Americans. Style is also very crude, making this book difficult to read. Utterly a yuck!

067960085X|5.0|This is a must read American Classic. Most of us have watched and loved the movie, but the book is even better. The movie deviates a little from the actual story of the book, so everyone should read the original. I purchased this book because I listened to the BBC Radio 4 Extra audio version of Breakfast at Tiffany's, and it was so much fun to listen to, that I wanted to purchase the book to read it myself. It's a pretty short read, but this high quality hard cover book is worth purchasing and keeping as part of the classics collection. Plus, his other three short stories are a plus.

B001G9F9IW|5.0|People often think that I don't have a sense of humor. This is mainly due to the fact that I don't tell jokes, and I rarely find comedies funny. Slapstick humor only works if it involves Peter Sellers, or similar genius. Most comedies are so predictable that I see the jokes coming, and they aren't very funny when they arrive. But that doesn't mean that I don't like to laugh. I look for comedy within other genres because I find that humor works better for me when it is witty, and buried within a believable situation. That's why I turn to directors like Quentin Tarantino, the Coens, Martin McDonagh, Wes Anderson, and Woody Allen when I want to laugh.<br /><br />Woody Allen's humor won't work for everyone. His earlier work did contain significant amounts of physical humor and jokes, but I think he's at his best when he writes more seriously. Vicky Cristina Barcelona falls into that category. It's an examination of human nature, more than a comedy, but there are still plenty of amusing scenes.<br /><br />What qualities do you find attractive in a romantic partner? Allen asks that question, and uses Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) to show two very different views. Vicky seeks stability, and likes to know what to expect from her man. Cristina is more of a free spirit, and wants her partners to have a similar outlook on life. Vicky has her future carefully planned, and is due to marry, whereas Cristina is still exploring and trying to find exactly what it is she is looking for. The thing is, she isn't sure what that is.<br /><br />Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) is an artist, and boldly asks the two women to take a trip with him. He openly says that they will all make love during the trip. This proposition is attractive to Cristina, but Vicky is shocked by his brazen approach and wants nothing to do with him. Needless to say, the three do eventually make the trip. Juan Antonio is not a conventional man, and still has feelings for ex-wife Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz). Like him, she's passionate and unpredictable, as well as being an artist herself.<br /><br />The story uses a narrator, and it's a great vehicle for some of the humor. Allen assembles a fantastic cast, as always, and the principals all give strong performances. Other notable appearances come from Vicky's husband-to-be, Doug (Chris Messina), and Judy (Patricia Clarkson), who is an important part of the puzzle.<br /><br />Pen&eacute;lope Cruz won an Oscar for her supporting role, and she certainly steals most of the scenes in which she appears. Her character is a catalyst for the events that unfold in the second half of the movie, and it's during this time that Allen raises the most questions about the motives of his characters.<br /><br />The writing is superb and left me thinking about relationships I have been involved in, and also some of the relationships that I have watched develop between my friends and acquaintances. Human interactions are unpredictable, complicated, and fascinating, and Allen weaves an interesting tale featuring all of those elements.<br /><br />If you enjoyed such movies as Closer, Midnight in Paris, (500) Days of Summer, or The Graduate, you'll probably find something to like in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I think it's up there with Allen's most enjoyable work.nélope Cruz).

B00B5HQKNI|3.0|With much hype and music appeal and daniel craig appeal I was all set to like<br />this---did not.  Very disappointed in the awkwardness of the plot and characters.
B002JCSWVG|4.0|I have very little time for politicians, I'm not a fan of rugby, and I know very little about South Africa. However, I do think that Clint Eastwood makes a lot of important films, and I enjoy the acting of Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. That's why I decided to watch Invictus when it was released on Blu-ray four years ago.<br /><br />Mandela was occasionally in the news during my childhood, but events happening on another continent meant very little to me as a young boy. As an adult, I have come to appreciate people who sacrificed much of their lives in an attempt to change the way people think. If you connected with Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, try to imagine a similar scenario in the modern world.<br /><br />Mandela campaigned against apartheid, and was imprisoned for his actions in 1963. He spent 18 of his 27 years in prison on Robben Island, where he contracted tuberculosis. As I write this review, he's in hospital with pneumonia at the age of 94.<br /><br />Invictus shows some of the challenges faced by Mandela when he became South Africa's first black president in 1994. He defied expectations at every turn. An early scene gives us a clue about the man as he calls together his staff. Some of them are white, and expecting to be fired, but Mandela urges them to stay and continue to serve their country. He wants to forgive those who imprisoned him, and those who hate black South Africans. He realized that he was in a position to lead by example, and that it wasn't the time to settle old scores. Freeman's portrayal provides insight into Mandela's character, and shows us why he was loved by the people with whom he interacted.<br /><br />Racism is one of the most dangerous things in existence, and I believe that it will always be with us in some form. There is no logic in hating someone because of their color or origin, but we are still surrounded by people who do just that. I think it's incredibly ignorant to continue to hold such beliefs in modern society, but I won't turn this review into a debate about racism. I mention it because it's important to frame the story, and appreciate what Mandela was trying to do.<br /><br />So why is rugby an integral part of the story?<br /><br />When Mandela took office, South Africa had already been chosen to host the rugby world cup a year later. Mandela decided to use the occasion to help to unite South Africans in a common cause. Rugby had always been a game revered by white South Africans, while black South Africans preferred soccer. In fact, the black population frequently cheered for whichever team was playing their national team as a form of protest. Overcoming that level of hatred proved to be quite a challenge.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays South African Springbok captain, Francois Pienaar. He leads a team that is suffering from lack of belief in its own ability. There's a definite parallel between Mandela's efforts to unite the country, and Pienaar's task of uniting his team, the fans, and the media. Mandela meets him to discuss the importance of performing well in the world cup, and the two talk about leadership techniques.<br /><br />Invictus is an engaging story which appeals as a historical drama more than a movie about sports. You don't need to know anything about rugby in order to appreciate the story. Eastwood has constructed a film that deals with the weighty subject matter in a way that we can all understand. Freeman was deservedly nominated for his performance, and Damon is convincing as a rugby player.<br /><br />Films like this may be considered too idealistic by many, but it works for me. I realize that uniting a country is more difficult than the events portrayed on the screen over the course of two hours. What Invictus does is encourage me to think beyond my immediate surroundings, and appreciate some of the things faced by people living in other countries. It's not the best film ever made about politics or sports, but it's definitely worth your time if you want to broaden your horizons.den your horizons.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I actually saw this movie before I read the book, and feel that it did a superb job following the book. Perks made me think about life, and the way I see it. I loved how Charlie saw it, and that he chose to surround himself with people who thought that as well. He was very innocent, while at the same time wise for his years. To all, I would definitely recommend the book over the movie. His emotions are so much more complex than in the movie. The movie portrayed Charlie as a only slightly different kid. In the book, though, his personality is extremely unique. He is a loving soul, and puts everyone and everything in front of himself.

B001F7XIJW|1.0|Gojira can be understood with the context, \\"They want so hard to be Gorguts, but simply can't.\\"<br /><br />This album is interminable, full of lifeless riffs and vocals, constant chugging with occasional mock-technical sections. Gojira may have been aiming to create a subtle and layered work of art, with an overarching purpose and goal, but they clearly failed in that department. There is no emotion in this music, nothing driving it from one riff to the next, from the first song to the last. This album manages to incorporate Meshuggah's lack of melody with none of it's rhythmic intricacy. This album is a bland pile of offal that should only be used as a litmus test to find out if someone has awful and uninformed tastes in metal.
0385349947|5.0|I, like many of the other reviewers here, was familiar with the TEDTalk that this book is based on and was interested in reading the book. I have found all the flack that this book has received, especially from women, funny because she almost predicts it in the book. I applaud her for putting this book out there as a conversation piece or a place to start from. It's not preachy but rather \\"here's what I've experienced and some other examples that you might relate to\\". Any criticism told Ms. Sandberg herself based on this book is completely unwarranted. It shows that someone hasn't read it if they do.<br /><br />While some of the topics on parenting did not apply to me as I don't have children to balance, I found myself nodding along with this book many many times. I have just started out in my career and it made me reflect on some of the mistakes that I see now I have made in enabling this culture of inequality in the work force to continue. I have had real \\"light bulb moments\\" reading this. I often sit to the side and get frustrated at others for not including me without taking the risk of speaking up on my own. Since I started reading it I have found myself referencing it in conversations organically because the information in the book doesn't just apply to women but really to anyone who is \\"afraid\\" to be who they really want to be. I am going to be handing this book out to many of my colleagues so that we can discuss it. I think men should read it too so that they are better informed on how women \\"work\\" and can foster that in their own workplace rather than wondering why their female colleagues don't do the same things they do the same way. I know I will be more aware of the traps that we fall into in the workplace from now on from reading this book. I'm glad to be part of the conversation now. Knowing what I do now, it's hard to sit on the sidelines and stay silent any longer.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I had this on DVD for a few years but to experience it on bluray is amazing.  They perform all their classic Eagles hits as well as solo material.  A must have for any Eagles fan!
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Ok, so here's the skinny on this movie and why it is so very worth investment of money and time.  Most drivel that comes out of Hollyweird is banal and appeals to the lowest common denominator (usually sex, profanity, bathroom humor).  I'm all for some of that in a comedy but seems like these days it is everywhere.  I admit I was a bit daunted by the length of the movie--I thought there is no way I can sit through what I thought would be a docu-drama that took a lot of poetic license.<br /><br />What I found as I sat in the theater with my large soda and popcorn was a highly engrossing movie.  I'll be the first to say I'm not exactly a history buff or fan, but I found the characters so compelling.  I could hear myself in my head warning old Abe to watch out for the theater!  Don't go!  I found myself cheering for him to keep on with his efforts in the war and his desire to free the slaves.  I laughed out loud as Tommy Lee Jones' character berated and belittled his fellow elected officials in such a way that half the time it almost appeared to be a compliment!<br /><br />In these days of nearly constant CGI, this movie was a refreshing return to real movie making--with actual locations, actual actors and stuntment.  I just bought the DVD and I look forward to getting on the couch under a comfy blanket and a big bowl of popcorn and a cold beverage so I can watch this movie again!

B009AMANBA|5.0|Spielberg and Daniel Day Lewis at their very best! This film should have received more awards than it did. Lewis's Lincoln is so amazing that he has, once again, set an impossibly high bar for any who will portray our 16th President in the future. The rest of the cast is truly outstanding, although unavoidably overshadowed by Lewis's great performance of &#34;Lincoln&#34;. And the screenplay and narrow focus of the story (the 13th amendment to the constitution) is a welcome change from other Lincoln films which cover too much ground or simply focus on the assassination at Ford's Theatre. A truly great work of historical and artistic significance.  Begs to be viewed more than once. Highly recommended!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I want to confirm that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY.  I have played nearly every day since Christmas, and have not spent a dime.  I find this game to be very enjoyable and have learned tips to make game play last longer. (Coffee, cookies, etc.)  I don't live my life around this game, therefore, I don't have a problem with the time limitations.  I find it to be a very relaxing pastime and it's one of my favorite games.  A little patience is required at first, but as you move up in levels you also move up in strength and energy.  You do have the option of buying diamonds in exchange for strength, energy, or items needed to advance gameplay.  I have never felt the need to make a purchase and have steadily moved up in levels.  If you do plan to play a game with purchase options, I recommend this one.  They are updating often, and gameplay is very enjoyable.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|August 2015 Update: Those of you who are perusing through the bank of Amazon customer reviews for this novel may have noticed several mentions of copious and overt typographical and formatting errors littering its Kindle edition. Please note that the digital version of IT being offered by Amazon as of the beginning of August, 2015, has cleaned all of them up, making the ebook version now finally worthy of, and tantamount to, the paper editions.   I've completed reading Stephen King's IT, 27 long years after I first attempted to. I originally tried to read it back in 1986, when the paperback was first released, but only made it 300 some-odd pages into its 1,138 page bulk before calling it a day. Stephen King has always, by many leagues, been my favorite author, but at the time, IT just seemed like too much of a commitment. Maybe &#34;too much of a good thing&#34;. So I waited. Waited for the energy, drive and desire to wade through a novel of that mammoth weight. It took over a quarter of a century to arrive. Now that it's at last behind me, I have to say I found the book to be messy at times, meandering in moments, and maybe no book of his has betrayed more overtly the fact that King doesn't map out his narratives in advance, he just makes them up as he goes, starting out with characters and a basic situation, then walking along with them down a road for which none of them knows the ultimate destination. King, who, in my opinion, writes dialogue for adults better than any other author, living or dead, continues to misfire with his dialogue for children, who always seem too precocious and advanced to feel totally authentic. Oh, and did I mention a map of Derry, Maine would have come in awful handy for those of us who are visual learners, Stevie, my boy? For me, in the final equation, the book did not earn its accolades from King fans of being one of his top tier masterworks, but even with its shortcomings and missteps, it was also never less than spellbinding and enthralling. There's something in King's writing that always lives and breathes in a way that other writers never capture for me. Maybe it's because most other writers do chart out the course of their narratives. Maybe it's in the calculating symmetry of that kind of conscious construction where something essential in the most soul-stirring of stories is murdered. Maybe there's something in the mess, the meandering, the asymmetry of King's vision that rings truer to life than his contemporaries because what is life if not a meandering, asymmetrical mess? Now, I move on to his 1990 collection of novellas, FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT, content that a long-missing piece in my life's puzzle has at long last been put in place...
B00BFUC8RC|3.0|its ok but its a little laggy sometimes, and its not that super duper ooper dooper super oober gloober good
B0017SWSCW|5.0|My wife read this 5 years ago, and kept telling me to read it so I downloaded it as an E book and think it was one of Archer's best!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thrilling, intriguing, and leaving you craving for more, the hunger games was the best book I've ever read, filled with romance, survival, and rebellion, from the viewpoint of a simple 16 year old girl whose main goal in life is to provide for her family. I recommend this to anyone who likes action with a touch of uncertain love.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My husband and I both love this game of multiple connections, although it is much more like connecting circuits than making colors of water flow.  It is a great logic puzzle in which deduction beats inspiration, but inspiration is needed when false assumptions are made.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was received quicky, at a fair price, great show. Actors are very good as is story line. Would highly recommend.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is great to read when you're bored at work, on the toilet, riding, etc... It works great and the free books are a plus.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Nice story, liked it if a bit predictable. a different view of the world as seen by a dog.<br /><br />from a dog guy
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I rarely read, ok lets be honest, I never read.  I saw this book on the news and decided to give it a try.  It was awesome!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Haven't had any problems. Works better than the plain old email app and syncs well with my computer. Very satisfied.
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|fun game to play to pass the time.  I enjoyed playing this game until I got wore out on it.  Used to play it all the time and then I lost interest in it for some reason.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is such an awesome and addicting game. So fun do do missions and try to beat you facebook friends. I love how they go to a different place and have new characters all the time!!! This game is so much fun and should continue with all new places and characters
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I don't usually like thrillers, but on a recommendation from a librarian I began reading it. This book is well written & easy to read, the layered storyline makes the ending unpredictable, yet believable. I read this book in 2 sittings, Highly recommend it!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|This would have received a 4 maybe a 5 star review, depending on how the rest of the game developed. I'll never know because I won't waste anymore time just to find all progress lost. I hope the developers take these low ratings seriously and fix the problem (I'm using a Kindle Fire). I was really enjoying it until it reset.  I was even playing everyday though offline. but if you have to play online often enough or even have to play everyday- that's wrong.  So which is it- lack of ethics or competency, developers?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Just finished the game.  It was superb.  The graphics &amp; cutscenes were great.  Plenty of hidden objects &amp; mini games.  Highly recommended.
B008JOLG7U|5.0|This is a nice collection of dancing music performed by Jennifer Lopez.  I have enjoyed her music over the years.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found.<br />It does exactly what I was looking for it to do.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I first purchased one for my daughter's new room that we painted pink.  She loves princesses and I was hoping to break up all the pink!  I was afraid they would not work for us because we have knockdown textured walls.  But, we had no problems with them at all!  My daughter is even able to move them around, and they still stick great.  They worked so well, I got a second set for my other daughter and a transformer set for my son.  All three kids are very happy with them, and the price is great!<br /><br />The only bad thing (that I didn't take stars away for) is that the gems did not stick well at all!  They want to fall off everything; the girls stuck them to doors, walls, furniture, a light switch..., and they seem to fall off of everything unless they are pressed on very hard and left alone.  The ones that have stuck the best are the ones they used to decorate the dress of one of the wall stickers.  But I considered these a bonus, so I am not upset by it.  However, I would definitely not purchase them separately!  :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app, but it could be better. I prefer Horse Life Adventures, but this one's still pretty fun.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I was a student at UW-Madison from 1967-72, the peak of the Vietnam nonsense. McNamara has had a bad rap, and this film gives validation to his integrity. McNamara was Secretary of Defense from 1960-67 and was fired when Johnson decided to make Vietnam his own plaything. There are important suggestions that McNamara was instrumental in avoiding the Cuban missile crisis.<br /><br />Madison, at that time, was a hot-house of student unrest, which was an education unto itself.<br /><br />\\"The Fog of War\\" is a good film, winner of most doc awards in '03, and worthy. When McNamara was fired, most of the damage had been done, and Johnson wouldn't listen anymore. The film leaves a lot to be decided by the viewer; was McNamara the \\"evil bastard\\", as history labels him, or was he Johnson's lackey? The film suggests the latter, and it's hard to doubt his sincerity, with (I think) genuine tears and guilt.<br /><br />As a parable, it's hard to decide who are the good guys and bad guys when confronted with a quandary such as Vietnam. McNamara had seen war, and studied it, but admits there's a \\"fog\\" that will never allow anyone to know the why and wherefore. He also admits there were mistakes.<br /><br />This is an honest film, worthy of the Oscar and the many others. I'm very glad I finally saw it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is an excellent beginning to what I hope to see completed! Great depth of plot, characters and sociopolitical and magical physics!
098555780X|5.0|To get the most from this book- review it first!  I accidentally became  a fan of J.D Lenzen the author of Paracord Fusion Ties. While browsing Youtube videos, I came across his videos for paracord bracelets. I watched, thought &#34;I can do that&#34; and bought some paracord. Lo, the next day I had in hand a paracord bracelet just as the author had demonstrated! As a left-handed person I often have to turn things around in my brain to make things work because I start with my left hand, not my right. Having the book helps offset that need to spatially re-arrange things, making tying easier and faster for me.<br /><br />Even the most difficult tie in this book is easy to follow, and the author has provided videos of almost all of his fusion tie creations.<br />The layout of the book is simple: you'll find a list of websites related to paracord supplies; a brief discussion on sizing bracelets, cutting and sealing ties; and a very important explaination of &#34;twists and terms&#34;.  Each tie is shown in clear bright colors from beginning to end.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can place myself in this book and almost feel what these people are going through.  It's not fantastical and unbelievable like so many of the books these days.  It left me with a desire to know more that is undeniable.  The pace in which we are given information is just right, not leaving us to wonder too long.  The message gradually becomes clear and is jaw dropping!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Well written but also an easy read. It was very entertaining and very unpredictable. It was exciting, scary, emotional, sad, disturbing all at once. I would definitely recommend this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the most suspenseful season of the three. It keeps you at the edge of your seat for each episode.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|It's harder than I thought it would be!  It's definitely worth the money, and I've enjoyed trying to work out the puzzles.  It's a good thing that I'm not an engineer!
B0073PPXLG|5.0|One of the best anti-war movies made. Great story, great acting, great music, great directing and great editing. Check it out.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|If it would have ended slightly different this movie would have probably been a 2 star for me. I believe the beginning was a little too slow for my taste. The time he spent on the boat with the tiger was funny and interesting, but it wasn't until he found himself on the mysterious island that I really got into the movie. I absolutely loved the ending and what the story truly represented was what I enjoyed most.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome read!!!  I love a book where you don't want to put it down....  This one fits the bill !!
B00156VGX8|5.0|Sick of watching the same old thing? This is one of those \\"different\\" films. Just look at the cover. What question(s) does the women in the light, barely there, white dress invoke? This is a must see film... Antichrist, Downloading Nancy, Bad Boy Bubby are other films to consider...thx
B006MW3V6U|5.0|great series
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I have been considering reading the book for a while, because it have been praised by many. And I don't regret I finally did.<br /><br />The author managed to deliver a beautiful story about love within the frames of reality. The characters are extremely well developed: a balanced mix of flaws and strengths that makes them very human. The love story is still very romantic, but the authors managed to wove the elements of real life into it in order to show the real picture of love. Not all high school girls suddenly meet a handsome stranger who recently move to their town, and fall in love and live happily ever after. Life happens along the way, and feelings cannot always be a top priory.<br /><br />I loved Lake and Will as individuals too. They had depth and life in them, which many authors often fail to include in their books. The story it self is not the main pillar of the book, the characters are. Because if they are written well, the story happens on it's own.<br /><br />Everyone should read this book, both young and not-so-young adults. It is not just a YA-novel.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|great series can't wait for series.  collecion essential for review and any missed episodes, hope they continues with the rest.
B005LAIII0|5.0|So many reviews talk about the quality of the film as if your average customer is a certified critic. My review will only serve to say that the SPECIAL FEATURES on this disc are EXEMPLARY! I actually cried during the stories Ang Lee and Suraj talked about. This movie should have won the Oscar for best picture (not that Argo shouldn't have) , but they did give Best Director to Ang Lee and some other crucial Oscars to this film. Altogether, this is now one of my favorite blurays particularly because of the quality of the special features. Much like the quality that was on the Lord of The Rings Movies. This is a great transfer with worthwhile extras!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|off beat, a wonderful story, some memorable songs.  definitely refreshing.  should see the movie sugar man to complement the music
006198969X|5.0|I'm a young woman who's just getting into fashion and style and makeup, and this book was so very helpful! My mom isn't super girly, so when it comes to fashion (especially makeup and how to apply things) I'm on my own. Typically I would learn about a product (OMG, what's bronzer?) and then google it for information and tips on what to get and how to put it on.<br /><br />This book is wonderful! Easy to read and understand, and packed full of information that I didn't even know I needed! LC is very personable too - she talks about having dressing room anxiety - she's a real woman and has the same issues that I do when it comes to clothes.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone that wants to be more stylish, and I would especially recommend this to young girls that are interested in fashion (with the bonus of a good confidence boost - you're not alone!). I won't have to google makeup tips anymore! Love this book!
B001BKVWYG|4.0|see above review--covers the topic.  liked his story more than i loved his music but definitely worth listening to just to support an amazing character.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Having great fun with this game. Would recommend. Got it one day to when offered .<br />for free and I've really lucked out. Such a deal .
B002BEXF5A|5.0|Nicely packaged with recent interviews from the band members. The material itself stands the test of time well, probably because it was so ahead of its time.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|DVD is top notch and price is great. My husband is a devotee of James Bond and this was a great addition to his collection. Thank you!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Cant wait for season three.  The second season set up a lot more of the upcoming story lines.  Great Show.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Bought it for my husband and he loves it. He has an entire James Bond collection. Very happy with our purchase.
B002XISFGS|4.0|back in 1979 , Wise directed  the first STAR TREK film , the only one that looked an had the feel of a \\"epic \\" movie . Wise was a great dirctor an hired the best special effects men around , though Paramount pushed the him to hurry up an get in the theaters before he had the time to re-edit the film , so , yeah you have alot of scenes with just the crew looking at the viewscreen , gasping an with their mouths open . If he had more time to finish the film the right way , We may had enjoyed it better . I liked the film , the 'bridge looked awesome \\" , finally we saw the Enterprise look  enchanting , the crew 10 years older and they didnt wear those doppy red (hide the waistline ) jackets , but Kirk wore 3 diffrent uniforms an the movie had a good budget after this film they reused Enterprise scenes from each other films in different angles . yeah im waiting for the release of this film in 3/13 in blu ray an hope its as good this verison an perhaps more
B007REV4T8|5.0|Bought it for my husband and he loves it. He has an entire James Bond collection. Very happy with our purchase.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozer is an entertaining and addicting game. I do wish you could get coins more quickly in the beginning but a good way to pass the time.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|The best part of the movie was the trippy opening credits sequence. Beyond that, the action sequences were unoriginal, the plot had many gaps, and in general, the movie lacked the cool gadgets that used to set Bond films apart.  A few throwback references sealed a mediocre attempt at mixing the old with the new.  The last third of the movie set at SkyFall was complete cheese.  Falls short of the standard set by Casino Royale.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I always thought that since I was older I wouldn't enjoy this book. It was amazing! Well written and a fast read.
B00BL5EQLC|2.0|Played for about 10 minutes. Runs well and looks nice, but the controls aren't set up very well. Makes this game more frustrating than fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the greatest games I've ever played, and I thought nothing<br />Could hook me like this one
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Not for everybody but extremely well done. Acting was exceptional.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great fun gets faster I like all the dashes. Need to turn sound off.  But<br />other than its great fun like to see what you can buy when you reach the goals.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game! My son has been playing this game in the car on the way to Florida and he loves it!! The only complaint I have is they need k more ways to earn rewards, instead of making people purchase credits..
0345803507|5.0|Fun well I blah blah blah blah and and and and and and and... for petes sake why more words
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Umm could this get anything less than 5 stars?  I would give it 10!  One of the greatest bands of all time.
0486275590|5.0|Purchased a number of copies for a private school classroom.  Executive Director was pleased and the students enjoyed the read.
1595141979|5.0|\\"Rose Hathaway?\\"<br /> Someone elbowed me, like maybe I didn't recognise my one name. Swallowing, I stood and walked down the bleachers, robotlike. There was a mistake. There had to be a mistake.<br /><br />Better and better as they go, Richelle Mead's Shadow Kiss really hit my expectations of this hyped series. Filled with heart wrenching twists and unexpected sacrifices, and an astonishing cliffhanger tops it off, ruining my 'meh-ness' to this series. Shadow Kiss left me with a full page of notes for my review, yet I still don't think words can fathom my love.<br /><br />They come first. Rose Hathaway comprehends that she must not fall in love with another dhampir guardian, in order to keep her friend, Lisa safe. But sometimes, rules must be broken, and sacrifices must be enforced. Especially when Rose started to see ghosts...<br /><br />\\"You have the patience of a saint,\\" I grumbled, slouching into a chair. \\"And besides, you don't hang out with him 24/7.\\"<br />\\"Neither do you. It's only 24/6.\\"<br />\\"Same difference. It might as well be 24/10.\\"<br />She frowned. \\"That doesn't make any sense.\\"<br /><br />In each book, I'm becoming more in love with each and everyone one of these characters- well with the exception of a few. Rose is another one of those humorous yet kick-ass protagonists that don't stretch out what becomes unbelievable but borders the realism and epic-ness in evenly. I admire how Rose can switch her moods, adjusting to situations, however there are times where I still find her as the 'whiny little girl' I once described.<br /><br />Lisa is as annoying and helpless as can be, I really feel like grabbing her out of the book and torturing her. In comparison to Rose- to the other supporting characters even, she fails harshly at staying brave and focused. While I understand this can be the typical Moroi Princess characteristics, Lissa always came to my mind as a original vampire, different and admirable. Well I guess not.<br />Adrian and Dimitri are awesome as ever. Both are just as kick as and perfect matches for Rose. Though I'm sure I'm still Team Dimitri.  And a bonus- we get to know more about Christian. Honestly, I hated his guts in VA and Frostbite, but we get to see another side of Christian, and if can be irritating at times but somehow manages to be an admirable aspect.<br /><br /> \\"Rose is in red<br />But never in blue<br />Sharp as a thorn<br />Fights like one too.\\"<br /><br />Like always, Richelle Mead accomplishes something I rarely see done successfully- recapping the previous books. Here are what other authors do as alternatives:<br />- Recaps, failing by info dumping instead<br />- Recaps things that never happened in the previous books<br />- Doesn't recap<br />Mead recaps alright, with style. She doesn't bombard if all in one shot, hoping we don't feel like it's killing our brains, but slowly and smoothly unravels previous events as they are reissued in the book. Even near the end, she was still reminding us of past events.<br /><br />Shadow Kiss had an excellent plot. I don't think I can even outline the story without ruining some aspect with the grand amount of ugly twists. But lemme assure you, fellow readers. There is plenty of gushy romance, glaring twists and turns that will wreck your souls. Be prepared.<br /><br />It cannot be pushed enough that I marvel this book to pieces. I don't now how better this series can get but Richelle seems to promise so. Filled with everything a YA book needs, Vampire Academy series is a big stand out among those other sleazy vamp books. Recommended to anyone who wants there heart broken.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|It's as good as it gets. Lots of detail if you want it. Nice format and colors. I check it every day and since I got it my stock has gone up. Coincidence? Maybe.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This hidden object<br /> game is so much fun, the graphics and story line are will have you addicted to the game.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I loved playing this game. I couldn't wait to see what the animal looked like in the next time it leveled up. I also loved the games u played with them.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a fun, tongue-in-cheek movie. No deep message, but great for a soggy Saturday night! Well worth a look!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book, can't wait to read the next two in the trilogy. I would definitely recommend this series of novels to my friends.
B002EMESSM|5.0|I have seen this many times and will see it again.  I am a Trekkie.  Shatter is so young in this movie.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Good game. Lots of fun to play. I have had a very good time playing this game. I am sure you will too. It is quite a challenge to complete all the different levels. I am sure you will enjoy it. I wish you did not have to wait for more lives.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Books that ramble along toward no particular destination are annoying.  Movies that do likewise can be intolerable.  The only thing that saves this movie is the perception that all the parts will coalesce at the end.  They did not.
B005Y8KWNS|5.0|I've been using MDScan for quite a long time. The app has totally replaced by own traditional scanner. It's simply brilliant. Not only does scanning take less time but the quality of scanned pages is excellent. Not trimming, no correcting of images. The app does it all and saves all of your files as either PDF or ZIP ready to be sent. Brilliant!
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|In addition to the highly professional cast, (Helen Mirren is a favorite of mine) the screen play was well written, the plot had a pleasing pace, and the subject was interesting.  This is a movie worth watching.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son plays  this all the time he likes it just as much as the one on the xbox. A great game well thought out for tablets.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Production values are unequaled. I'll bet the author had the end of the War of the Roses in mind when he put this together. A very<br />hairy period, e.g. wars, pestilences, foreign invasions, famines, Large weather changes all accompanied by social upheavals.<br />All this leads to a period which it is easier to observe from the outside than as an observer on-the-spot - if you like the good life (or<br />any kind of life).<br />It is hard to imagine this sort of privation until you've seen enough of our current-day pest holes during war, pestilence, famine and open latrines (then throw in an Viking invasion).
B004MC8CA2|1.0|okay I'm an atheist and I wanted a laugh so I got this app, it worked this is the most fake thing ever...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I picked this up expecting little but hopeful because of the large number of positive reviews and was very pleasantly surprised.  I've worked in both the Military and NASA and didn't catch to many jarring moments where I felt that this is totally unrealistic.  Actually, quite the opposite. I don't know the Authors background but I caught inside references and he certainly nailed the bureaucracy of NASA and its interaction with crew. A fantastic read and certainly a writer who I would happily pay more to read.  This book is an absolute steal at it's current price (and it used to be free!). I'll pick up the audio book for my next long car drive with my family so they can enjoy it as well. I'm also recommending it to friends, some of whom will really get a kick out of it.<br />Great book,<br />Why are you still reading this review and not the book!
1451683405|3.0|Sam Harris is nothing if not interesting. He is someone whose ideas I can disagree with substantially, but I still hunt out his thoughts, I still read his writings. Free Will is a brief book about a complex subject. The thesis it seeks to prove is that free will is an illusion. The book is short and clearly written, so I do not want to get into a lot of detail here. Suffice it to say, Harris claims that we cannot know why we choose to watch something, why you are reading this now, etc. That if we took the time to really reflect on our experience, our thoughts, we would not be able to answer the question: Why am I reading this blog right now? At least not without a constructed narrative in hindsight. All our decisions, all our choices, all the reasons we choose why we choose something remain impenetrable to a final answer. Genetics. The fortune or misfortune of where, how, and to whom I was born. And so on. How is one free to choose if we cannot know why we choose and why there is good scientific evidence to indicate that our choices are acted upon prior to our knowledge of that choice.<br /><br />I'm not sure I buy Harris's argument, but I have not yet formulated a potential reason why. Regardless, it is worth reading.
0446310786|5.0|I am an avid reader of the classics so this book was perfect for me. Was exactly as described. Thanks.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This is a fantastic series. Be sure to start at the beginning and watch the whole thing through. It is worth it.
0385333846|5.0|Book is exactly as described. I am an avid reader, and enjoy the old classics so I like it a lot.
0670026603|4.0|This book was different and I enjoyed how the author described the characters and the scenes. Not the very best ending but probably as good as it could get considering the subject.
B007SGM084|4.0|I know  many people think this book is just a b o u t Bdsm, but I t really is so much more....I really hope the author decides to co n t I n is the series beyond t he first three books
B00BF123WG|5.0|The behind the scenes story to what we were seeing on CNN. We were watching a history lesson which made it all the more interesting.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Terrificly inventive but for me like Harry Potter without the compeling story line.  The timeline going backward and forward was very confusing.  Hard to follow what was happening when.  Just couldn't buy into the drama of the game.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|If you've got an android phone and want to read your books on something else besides a Kindle, you've got to have it.  Great for reading in the waiting room or stuck in that 4 hour traffic jam on the interstate or to let that obnoxious date that you're not really that interested as you read on your smartphone.  Enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is really fun and requires a little responsibility. Its fun how you get to train and compete, clean the horse,stall,and field.:-)
B004FRX0MY|4.0|First, I had to download the Amazon Appstore.  Then I had to download the Amazon MP3 Player.  After I downloaded it to my smartphone, I couldn't find it.  I had to open Appstore, open the menu, select &#34;downloaded apps, then open the app on my phone.  It took me a while to figure it put and the procedures are well hidden.  Once I opened it on my smartphone, I could listen to my &#34;99 Piano Masterpieces&#34; fo 99 cents on my smartphone.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This is the outdated version but for some reason, they won't update it for the Kindle Fire. No surprise that it's about to drop out of the top 100 altogether.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book was great, she is so amazing for tackling the trek with so little knowledge and experience.  It was a fun read
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was truly one of the best books I have ever read. You can feel every thing now feels and it seems like you are right there with her, wanting her to stay but also knowing why she would want to leave.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|If you like adventure and tales of long ago... pirates sailing the seas.... the real story is in this book. Take time to consume each chapter and enjoy the tale. Free with Amazon prime too.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Of course it works great, it`s a &#34;Sony Genuine PS2 Memory Card&#34; It says unknown, but it is a real Sony (the one I got anyway) It works great and is sturdy as ever. It Comes sealed and new.<br />  Thanks
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a must read starting point for your first Kindle book.  It contains a lot of information but yet is a fast and easy read.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|It makes a wonderful addition to my collection. I have been collecting Macgyver seasons for a while and I enjoy them all.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|Just can't get it to work, wish someone would just walk me through it. Is really like to use it. Especially since I paid for it
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|This app is fantastic. Looks great, plays great, sounds great. It's a shape-puzzle which happens to give you images ... which are downright gorgeous. I wouldn't mind a wallpaper selection of some of the mosaics in the game.<br /><br />But I'm a little bummed that I can't play the entire game. I didn't play (or click) 'Challenge' in one of the first pack's boards, and now the Glass Pack can't be completed. Because of this, I can't unlock the bonus levels. I've played through the Glass Pack multiple times again, but nothing triggers the 'Crystal Complete' achievement. Dangit. I will most likely reload and replay the game in a few months, so will get it right that time.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|An interesting story to follow... dark, yet from the mind of a mature and innocent teen. Survival, love, grief, politics.  You follow one person's story and by the third book really scrape the surface of the bigger picture.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|The menus, the introductory words (the galaxy far away language...)  and even the FBI warning are in Spanish. The picture was beautiful once I got rid of all of the commentaries and subtitles but that was very hard to do because of the Spanish which made the correct menus hard to find.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is the coolest thing ever. I have a rainbow dragon a seasonal dragon and a sakura dragon. This app is totes awesome!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awsome i love the way they added the rope and the mine cart part. Although one  HUGE problem everytime i hit save me and dont have aniugh gems it automaticly buys the largest gem pack.

B00866JL96|2.0|I loved the idea of this movie, I hadnt read the book..Its the story of a man finding a photo in a warzone and finding the woman in the picture - its about this journey and all the people involved..The movie started off as a bit confusing war movie..The photo's original owner wasnt clear, shame we didnt see/understand this man...Then this photo brings the male lead luck - surving when he shouldnt - its a bit of a blur as to which of his teammates survive and dont...He leaves the armed forces...which isnt explained...A 25 year old man who had served 3 tours overseas...He comes home to his sisters...suffering from post traumatic stress disorder...which miraculously dissapears as does any sign of his service skills, after he walks and finds the woman in the photo!!!! Although towards the very end, when he is confronted with the ex husband and a gun..his service skills finally show themselves!!..A dog at his sisters, becomes/is his? again, never explained....Lead actor Zac Efron, is/has a too young face for this role...with what his character had gone thru...he should have had physical scars, creases/lines in his face from all that he'd gone thru...instead, Zac is fresh faced, metro male...He has a beard to help 'age him' but it just makes him look like a older teenager with a darker five o clock shadow beard!!!  The main actress was really good...but was too 'old for him'....she was more like his 'older sister' feel..which was a shame...Zac's character is too perfect...can do everything with ease etc...Then, there is the confusion with main actress's story...we originally thought the man who died was her husband, not her brother...that wasnt made clear till much later in the movie...And the man we thought was her boyfriend, they certainly acted that way...was her nasty ex husband!!!Sooo confusing...And that made Zac's character feel even more younger...as the ex husband had 'age on him, his face had creases when he acted, as it should have'...A better choice for lead actor, would have been 'Chris Hemsworth'...he's an actor that can show strength, weakness etc...He would have been belivable in the role and been more balanced with all the actors...Blythe Danner's grandmother was perfect 5 stars..the son was perfect too..other characters were good too....It could have been a really great movie...instead it was more like a young girls immature fantasy...If the director was maybe trying to play an homarge to the actor Audie Murphy - who in real life was a baby faced true wartime hero, then actor....that was never alluded too..maybe then..Zac Efrons character would have made more sense..the son, could have been watching an audie murphy movie ( loved/ wanted to understand what his uncle went thru and audie murphy movies are that age appropriate etc) or a poster of audie murphy somewhere...while the movie is watchable...it lingers in your mind, only...as you try working out what happened and work out how to try to fix it...a real shame.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Signed up for Prime membership and working my way through this show, loved it, but didn't have time after S2 ... looking forward to catching up. Video quality and sound is great.. on wish is there was something that showed which episode I was set to watch next.
1936608898|5.0|I really loved this book!  It is an easy and quick read, has lots of good basic recipes and easily lays out the beginnings of paleo lifestyle nutrtion.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is a very dark book.  The name fits.  I found it slow at times but always thought provoking.  The reader becomes frustrated often with the main character as she hangs back to a point of laziness in my opinion.  Looking forward to more from this authour.
B0089LT8Y6|4.0|...is how I would describe this. It's almost excessively competent. Obviously these guys have been in the thrash biz for 30 years.  Been listening to these guys since the 80s and I'm just trying to find something that stands out from anything they've done previously.  And I'm not hearing it.  From that standpoint, the last record was better.<br /><br />Having said that, Dark Roots is obviously quite good.  But curiously, at the same time, nondescript.<br /><br />Hoglan's drumming is perfect, as always.  Chuck Billy's vocal performance is its usual distinctive self.  Production is tight.  Power chords, twin rhythm guitar harmonies, and of course wailing solos in all of the right places:  OK, jeez, I never heard any of that before.<br /><br />So yeah, 4 stars.  But not 5.
B006LSZECO|5.0|From beginning to end this book had me.  I like to try and figure out the story, but this one had me stumped till the end.  A far-fetched story that becomes believable.  The format is intriguing and beguiling.Really good read.
B000005RDY|4.0|Speaking of Crash Courses, where the hell is Crash Course in Brain Surgery?<br /><br />Despite that obvious omission (prob due to copyright issues), this disc does include Breadfan, with its intricately picked rhythm guitar in all its original glory.  Metallica's 1988 cover version is probably better, but the 1973 (1973!) original is still a classic of proto-speed metal.  And if you listen closely to the intro of Breadfan, especially at the first drum beat, it's obvious \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" (and GNRs entire brief career) owes a HUGE debt of gratitude to this song.<br /><br />Also recommended:  Typefitter's Hand; I Can't See My Feelings; I Ain't No Mountain; & Napoleon.<br /><br />Check these guys out.  This Best Of collection is an underrated gem.
0062238868|5.0|All we can say is that you must read it. Our hearts are saddened by the death of the author.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|One of the best original scores for TV or theatre ever written - fitting so well with the overall theme of the show and with a raw, native sound that is a pure joy to listen to.<br /><br />Its not for everyone, but any fan of BSG ought to own these!  Anyone who can think outside of the &#34;top 40/pop&#34; box will also enjoy this!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at this game. This being my first G5 game I was taken back by the intriguing story line and iteresting and compelling art. voice was a little dull and stilted but didn't take away from the game too much.  I am buying the next release!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|unduobtly a grate game but thare is one flaw but it is a major flaw.  whenever you shut off your divise completely it it must install more data
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Very interesting and involved series. Well acted and perfectly paced. Looking foward to season 3. It's hard not to watch all episodes in one night.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies...<br /><br />That's what seventeen-year-old Sky realizes after she meets Dean Holder. A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her she's never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.<br /><br />Sky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing he's nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isn't at all who he's been claiming to be. When the secrets he's been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of Sky's life will change forever.<br /><br />I've just re-read Hopeless for the second time because it is so freaking amazing. It brought out every emotion I could ever feel. I was laughed, cried, screamed at the page, got the butterflies and even needed to take a couple of 'chapter break's' ;)<br /><br />At the start of the story we meet Sky, possibly the funniest person in the whole wide world. This girl is amazing. When she meets Holder she is instantly attracted to him and very intruiged by him. The feeling is mutual, Holder immediately thinks she is somebody else and demands to know her name. He almost refuses to accept she is called Sky and that she isn't the girl he thought she was. He is extremely intense and this freaks Sky out.<br /><br />Later that day when out for a run, Sky quite literally runs into Holder. Upon this encounter, gone is the scary guy from earlier. He is replaced by friendly, flirty and funny Holder. Sky knows she is screwed! She likes him. Alot.<br /><br />Sky and Holder quicky form a bond and things are headed to the next level. The chemistry and banter between these characters is superb. It had me laughing out loud more times than I can remember.<br /><br />All good book's need a twist or a turning point, this had both. What went from being a very light hearted fun read went to a heart breaking story of betrayal, lies and deceit. I loved how the twist connected the characters. It was genius. I think I bit all of my nails off, terrified of what would happen to Sky.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover is such a talented writer. She touched two very sensitive subjects, and handled them extremely well. She drew every feeling i've ever felt, out of me whilst reading this.<br /><br />Im super excited for the follow up book to this series, which will be told from Holder's POV. It will be aptly named \\"Losing Hope\\"
B004WMKSH2|2.0|It may be because today is Easter and therefore the instant player is experiencing heavy volume but I can't get through this movie without it pausing every few minutes.  It keeps telling me that the player is unavailable at this time and to try again later.  A 2 and half hour movie has taken me nearly 4 hours to watch and we're still not finished.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Twists & turns as usual but excellent beginning to end. Well worth the time to read this book. 2nd book of Connelly's I've read and can't wait to get into the next
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a sweet story of unexpected love.  I liked how the story progressed never making it too easy but not too much controversy.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I downloaded for my 5 year old. She loves this game and it is easy for her to play. You can spend $ for extra gems or coins but you don't have to and they still have fun playing.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I'm not big on games but this is fun and engaging. Definately worth the price. I'm sure it will be great on long drives or waiting in Airports.
034580404X|1.0|Poor creativity in word choice - too predictable once the &#34;love scenes&#34; were<br />repeated. I hate to say it, but I did read all three and was glad to see everything turn our well in<br />the end, so there must have been something there that made me want to keep on reading.
B000F8O35U|1.0|The copy I received had the real bonus dvd but a fake copy of the movie.  The quality is terrible and the movie menu is so unprofessional, nothing Disney would produce.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|I first saw this movie in theaters, and I thought it was great. It was a great sci-fi film, and I enjoyed it, but the ending didn't really click with me. Otherwise, a good film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|&quot;Best game ever&quot; says my 10 yr old daughter.  She loves horses because she used to ride them. She says horses totally rule!
B001JIAK66|4.0|If you're looking for a good supernatural thriller, look no further than Van Helsing. You've got vampires, werewolves, frankenstein, and more. Altogether a good blend of characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a game that works well on the kindel fire it is easier. then on the phone. I love this game
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I loved the first Sherlock Holmes film because of the mystery all the way to the end. The second film doesn't disappoint. The action scenes are intense and the film was fantastic.
B000002GVO|4.0|Great album with no bad songs whatsoever, but too much Don.  Would have been nice to have Glenn sing Last resort and Randy or Joe sing Life in the Fast Lane, just for the sake of variety.  Otherwise it would have 5 stars in my book.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I got this app so that I could look at my Twitter feed on my Kindle Fire. It works great, no complaints.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Excellent movie. Great for parents and children. Might be a wee bit scary for younger children. Disney and Pixar do it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading the first Wool segment I was hooked. This is an original, addictive series. I loved the journey and can't wait to start Wool 6!
B006O2QNOU|3.0|The cast is a who's-who of dramatic talent, Kevin Spacey, Stanley-freakin'-Tucci, Jeremy Irons,that guy with the eyebrows who played Spock in Star Treck, and Demi Moore... who was a little underpowered for this role...as if it mattered. All of these impressively skilled actors seem called upon to under-sell their anger, feelings of betrayal, or impending doom that they either do or should feel, when a major crisis erupts in the Wall Street firm they trade for. It's somewhat plodding, with a lightly fueled feeling of anticipation...like something's going to happen at any moment; someone will be shot, or beaten, or start screaming, or throwing things. But no. It never happens. One thing I will give the filmmakers is that instead of feeling directly involved with the story, they managed to tell it in such a removed way, you feel almost as if the story were being told to you, by a reliable source who worked WITH the characters we met in the movie, who is now doing his best to re-tell it. I give 3 stars for the actors who made me want to keep watching but honestly, they were never given anything to care about or commit to story-wise.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This was another entirely plausible world that was great to read about. Enjoyed every page of it. The characters reacted realistically.
0802473164|5.0|This book will help you to determine what acts are important for you and your partner to foster a great relationship.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I got this game as the FAOTD on amazon and it turned out to be one of my most favorite games! Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a different type of game for their collection.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|I am looking forward to showing this to my classes.  I watched alone & 'whew'!  I was outraged & mesmerized!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is an album.  Set aside some time and listen from start to finish.  The way the songs work together is amazing.  If you own one Pink Floyd album, this is the one.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Delivered quickly, easy digital download, and DVD is clear with one great movie. Watched over and over and since its a guaranteed classic will watch many more times....
B0098G7AWS|1.0|When I first heard about this movie coming out, I was very excited.  After I saw it, all I could only think about was what it should have been.  Here you have one of the most fantastic stories of all times, a mega budget, and all we get is a ridiculous fictitious love story, and oh-by-the-way a ship that was considered unsinkable goes down on its maiden voyage.  Don't get me wrong, I think romance movies are great (one of my all-time favorite movies is \\"Casablanca\\").  However, in this case making the story of the sinking of the Titanic into a made up love story is just plain dumb, and as another reviewer said, an insult to those who lost their lives on that tragic night.<br /><br />The actual story of Titanic's sinking is incredible, and there are so many fascinating facts about it. None of this is in the movie.  Instead, all we get is a syrupy romance which had an element of the ridiculous, such as the chase scene through knee deep water with Rose's fiance trying to kill Jack (I was rooting for that to happen).  I could list many other examples, but you get my point.<br /><br />And then there is the character of Rose - here she is engaged to marry someone else, and almost the first thing she does when on board the ship is to ditch him, go around with Jack, pose naked for him and then have sex.  There are many words I could use to describe her, none of which should be used for an Amazon review.  Let's just say one of those words begins with a silent W.<br /><br />James Cameron is probably the most over rated director of our time.  His two biggest movies are Titanic and Avatar, the latter being the WORST written big budget movie of all time.  I've often said that Hollywood uses special effects way too much to cover up bad acting, bad writing and bad directing.  This should be Cameron's epitaph.<br /><br />If you want a really good movie about the actual sinking of the Titan, see \\"A Night To Remember\\", a low budget British movie from the 1950's based on Walter Lord'sbook.  Even adjusting for inflation, this movie's budget was a small fraction of this clunker, but way better.
1451695195|5.0|I have read several books on NDE's (near death experience).  This is by far the most technical and still is enjoyable.<br />The doctor makes a good case for the reality of NDE's.  I hope he's right!
0547848412|5.0|This book was one of those &#34;can't stop reading&#34; books. I loved it. It was better than the movie, which I thought was awesome. I didn't know what to expect next. It was intense and the story was one that made you think. Loved it!
B000P6PVLC|3.0|A powerful story and a great performance lead by Brad Pit.  The move explores a few stereotypes while interweaving of stories from lives across continents, making for an interesting movie.<br />* Typical Yankee tourists getting caught in unintended local crossifire, leading to an international incident<br />* Travails of undocumented immigrants in America  portrayed by Adriana Barraza<br />* The story of a Japanese girl coming to grips with her disability and teenage in modern day Japan.<br /><br />Four stars for plot, and performance. Three stars overall because the stories seem to stretch a bit thin at times.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|I hats this app. I cannot turn that car. I do not like it.  I cant believe people got this stupid app. I say DO NOT GET THIS APP
1843106698|2.0|This book is a compendium of research on Asperger's.  It was disappointing from an intellectual point of view because no rigorous attempt is made to evaluate sources and check for accuracy and assumptions.  For instance, the author trusts Liane Willey's (Pretending to be Normal) self-assessment as having Asperger's syndrome and then turns each of her personality quirks into a symptom of Asperger's.  This reasoning is circular.  And now we have a generalized set of diagnostic criteria for girls that is based on Liane Willey's history and personality.  It is alarming to note that Attwood's failure to evaluate sources has fundamentally directed how girls are diagnosed.    Most offensive, in his failure to scrutinize bias, the author runs the risk of incorporating Liane Willey's narcissism into the symptomatology of girl Aspies.  A self-centered world like Ms. Willey's should not be at all confused with Asperger's and does Aspies a severe injustice.    The book is not comprehensive in the sense that it expends no effort on \\"Intense World\\" theory, which has been a prominent topic in ASD discussions for over five years.  Instead, the book dwells on the \\"deficits\\" and inadequacies propagated by \\"Theory of Mind\\".  Furthermore, issues reflecting the real female experience of Asperger's (and not a semi-fictionalized genre of memoir, e.g. Willey's) are generally omitted and adults are almost ignored.  Because of this lack of attention, the book has the added effect of reinforcing the sexist notion that Asperger's is all about boy children.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have known this story for many years. It is a story that I do not tire of. Well written works are worth having in different forms of media.
0143035711|5.0|I am a Vietnam vet. I've been trying to read everything I can about this subject.  It is an accurate portrayal of how it was
B00425S1H8|5.0|The device worked on my Windows 8 laptop right out of the box. No manual loading of the driver. Recommend it for Windows 8 and Vista machines also.
B008220D5K|1.0|I rented this movie on Xfinity.  Inexplicably the movie ceased about 2/3 through. I consider that a blessing!  I didn't bother attempting to get it back.  It is trash!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|An amazing book \\"following\\" the prequel. Well worth reading but I will be curious to see how it all ties in. Wish that there was a little more detail to help really get a picture of the characters and their surroundings.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Nice and functional. Not sure where or how it accessed my old wav music, but it's good. I'm using it on my Amazon kindle. Would prefer it used my music from cloud player.<br />Star
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had so much trouble putting this book down!  It was a masterful creation of a really unique yet realistic world.  The characters were all very interesting and multi-dimensional, and it was so easy to become highly invested in the fate of all involved.  I definitely plan to read more works from this author!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Dear Readers young and old,  are you looking for something to entertain you for days - even if you are a fast reader?  Then you've certainly found the right book.  I'm a school librarian and a quick reader.  If something is really good I'll burn through it in a day or so, then spend another few days kicking myself because I read it too fast and should have made it last longer.  I read this as an ebook and after, I'm not even kidding at all here, three days of CONSTANT reading, when I closed the book it told me I was ONLY 55% through the story.  This Hugh Howey is a genius!  The story is obsessive - I couldn't put it down.  Right now I am sitting on the edge of my seat silently cheering the author on, wherever he is, to finish the last set of stories!  I can't wait to see what happens next!  After reading Wool Omnibus you'll want to read the SHIFT omnibus, then you'll be like me...waiting...hoping...for the success of Solo and Silo 17 and the rest of the characters you've come to love!
6304698798|5.0|I ordered this and one other film for our neighborhood outdoor (backyard) movie night and it was a LOT of fun!  Everyone loved the movie and such a classic movie is perfect for a backyard viewing with friends and family.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Saw them on Saturday Night Live and had to have the album.  I have not been disappointed, either.  Love the sound!
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Anyone with kids and/or over 40 will be depressed... Anyone without kids and/or under 40 will be bored.  I watched the entire movie waiting for something more and it never came!  This was a waste of $4.99!
1423165691|4.0|This book is great, and we enjoy the thick pages with what look like individually drawn sketches on each page, they really don't look re-produced for a book. The only downside is there are so many characters that it would be impossiable to please every Disney fan. That being said, I really wish there was more devoted to classic Mickey, Minnie and the gang, especially Oswald. Oh well, here is hoping for volume 2!
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Absolutely wonderful!  The performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones were fabulous and well worth watching.  A truly eye-opening experience about the real-life drama of that era, informative and revealing.  So interesting to see that the same political 'games' that we complain about today were going on in Lincoln's time.  Sadly, some things never change. A history lesson brought to life that gives an intimate look at some of our country's most influential players.  I highly recommend this movie to young and old alike.
B002OSY2T6|3.0|This is a good toy for kids, but the only concern i am having is its design. The two big straight ears of this snail can cause potential injury to the eyes of baby.

B009RI4FRU|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Highly original in both concept and style -as is customary with any Wes Anderson production - \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" nevertheless proves that, even in the most skillful of hands, a little quirkiness can go a long way.<br /><br />Set in 1965, this surrealistic indie comedy focuses on two misfit children - one a twelve-year-old orphan and the other the daughter of two whacked-out parents - who run off to a remote New England island so they can live in isolation with one another, right as a hurricane is about to hit the area.<br /><br />The talented Jared Gilman and Kara Haywood play the two social outcasts, while the adults are portrayed by Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and Harvey Keitel as an assortment of parents, troop leaders, detectives and social services officials. The irony is that most of the adults turn out to be even more bizarre and dysfunctional than the children who've run away because they just don't fit in.<br /><br />Co-written  by Roman Coppola and Wes  Anderson and directed by Anderson, \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is overflowing with wit, striking imagery and on-the-mark deadpan performances. But the archness does get to be a bit much at times, and the atonal, emotionless line readings eventually take their toll on the audience.<br /><br />It's a clever and likable enough little trifle that, even at a relatively brief 94-minute running time, winds up overstaying its welcome. But the critics sure seem to love it.
0547564651|5.0|Does not give a laundry list of ideas. Not a how-to book. But I loved it. In our school we have a type of character ed program in place, but after reading this book I think we are going about things the wrong way. I believe we are looking at character the wrong way, or in too-limited a way. We are essentially working on behavior, or getting students not to misbehave. We are not systematically developing the character traits, like grit, determination, and perseverance, that will allow students to get through everything that faces them and reach their potential.
B0032U45JW|4.0|I haven't seen this movie for a few years now, and my daughter will have a role in a local theatre group's staging of the play so I wanted to watch it again.  One has to pay close attention because there are a number of characters and the plot and dialogue moves fast.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I enjoyed the series.  Other than answering a question which could have been answered in the third volume, this volume contributed very little to the story.  I expected more.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is beautifully written. Ms. Strayed is a master of mood and atmosphere. Her story will make you want to hike the Pacific Crest Trail and make you believe that you can.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Well worth the time and effort. This is not a mindless show. It takes involvement. But. I like such shows. Not for couch potatoes! Takes some thinking...
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Very impressive. Fits my new canon t3i nice and safe. Could have been better if it would have been arranged such a way so that taking out camera while holding bag on shoulder.<br /><br />ALL and all loved it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have several knives, I like that this is compact and easy to use. I know I will use this for years to come
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this app is really cool and really easy personally I like it allot and I play it like 24/7
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I agree with the 5-star rewievers. Yes, the movie is sort of too dark in places, but that didn't take the tension away. In addition, this movie is also a homage to Seal Team 6 and Special Forces. Those guys are incredible. In restrospect you wonder how they got UBL after having to deal with the portentous Washington DC bureaucracy. We need more people like Maya.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This was the best flashlight app I found,I seen others say it had ads I've had it for about a month and haven't noticed any nor any unwanted activity.I didn't try them all but I did try about 5 others and this was the best one I came across.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game because it is like the real game on the Xbox. Also it is fun. Good bye!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The newest version of &#34;Les Miserables&#34; works yet is less than the terrific movie it should have been.  The decision to film the performers singing the rousing songs instead of them lip-synching was not a good one.  Plus, the annoying extreme close-ups during the entire songs does not contribute to a fully satisfying motion picture.  Still, it is worth seeing -- especially if you are one of the very few who have not seen the stage version.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Excellent series. Video quality was great even when played from the Kindle to an HDTV. I highly recommend this series!
B008220C38|5.0|A stunning take on a story that has been filmed many times before.  This Anna is depicted as a play being performed in an old, faded theatre.  Keira Knightley is just fine in the lead role.  She's not Garbo, but does well.  And just visually the movie is simply gorgeous!
B0094K1MH2|2.0|Many characters do things without any real motivation. A dog that is smarter than his owner. Not a movie for anyone over the age of 10, but subject matter inappropriate for anyone younger than 12.  Glorifies alcoholism or makes light of it, might as well throw in a few racial slurs also.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Even if &#34;Lincoln&#34; weren't a great movie, it would be more than worthwhile seeing it just for the amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.  He simply IS Lincoln.  But the rest of the film is terrific, too.  Tommy Lee Jones as Thadeus Stevens is unforgettable.  Steven Spielberg has done it again!
1451638450|5.0|We want more of Ivan and Tej. Hopefully after Count Aral's Death. At start of change over  the Miltary to Dipolmatic corp.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Kathryn Bigelow has bravely made this film about the killing of Osama Bin Laden and has succeeded admirably.  The background story of an obsessed distaff CIA agent as performed by an inspired Jessica Chastain is unforgettable.  A must-see.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The characters are either lovable or you can actually hate them, I think Daryl and I could be friends. The character interaction draws you in to their lives like you know them personally.  I love the locations they used and the authenticity of the set.  They also were not afraid to let main characters die and not have an all out happy ending like real life.  It's a zombie show but, I'm intrigued by the desolation.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I like this app because it's easy to see the estimated percentage of battery left.<br /><br />I bought an extended battery for my HTC EVO V 4G(HTC EVO 3D) Virgin Mobile phone(most people know why you would want this if they own this awesome phone even if it's not the latest/greatest).  After charging it and finding the 1+ hours of time where I wouldn't need to touch my phone, I decided to calibrate Battery HD to make sure it would be as accurate as possible.<br /><br />I am confused about the numbers the calibration came up with.  Right now, it shows:<br />Music Playback: 9 hours 30 min<br />Video Playback: 23 hours 50 min<br /><br />This to me makes absolutely no sense.  If anything I should have a gazillion hours of music playback, and much less video playback time.<br /><br />Anyone else notice this miscalculation with this otherwise great app?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well written, wonderful acting, beautiful sets and interesting characters make this household fun to watch, season after season. Hope to see many more.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This author makes reading a treat.  Once you start reading any of Vince's books it is impossible to put the book down.  It is a real treat to having Vince Flynn back again, and I hope he continues to keeping us involved with Rapp.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved it. I was hesitant to read this series as I thought it was for a younger crowd. But after my friend convinced me to give them a chance I am glad I did. The story is thoroughly engrossing and hard to put down. For me, I love the first book and this book. If you are unsure of this story I insist you give it a chance.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this is a great game really fun online gameplay is also good for peaple how dont get this game should get this game
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I like its historical perspective but the chase of the airplane at the end was a little hyperbolic.  I liked the suspense.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love all the Characters you can buy and all the hover boards and the power ups If you don't have this game you should definitely get it it's probably the best free game out there
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I've read in a long long time! I will read more by this author.  Its twisted- sick lol
B007H1HQW0|5.0|We used this to make wine bottle votives for our wedding. Worked BEAUTIFULLY. Have to get the process down with hot and cold water, but this tool made our lives SO much easier! Thanks.
B00BF11STU|3.0|The viewer is kept on the edge of their seats through the movie. A bit long though and some parts are too graphic
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it is above amazing I play it every day I have my kindle. great job making the app. PLAY IT!!!!
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|\\"Lincoln\\" is a masterpiece of the first order -- certainly one of the director's career-best films in my view. It's also hands-down the best film ever made about the US of A -- what we are, what we aren't, what we could be. It's a most important artistic mulling over of our country, its processes, and the human being we hold up as the paragon of its leadership. I've never seen anything quite like it: a rich, challenging, and so frequently moving meditation about this land I was born upon. The entire cast (which is full of some of our best working character actors) is outstanding across the board, but I was particularly amazed by the performances of James Spader (as W.N. Bilbo), Jared Harris (as General Ulysses S. Grant), and the riveting Sally Field (as Mary Todd Lincoln). And there's no praise high enough for the work of Daniel Day-Lewis (in the title role), Tony Kushner (who wrote the script), and Spielberg. I'm not even going to try to capture their achievement in words. The three of them have offered something to all of us that is truly special and so very needed as our nation looks forward. For goodness sake, watch this movie.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|It was hard to follow and didn't make any sense. We ended up talking to each other through the whole movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I got this app to get ideas for snacks and hair styles! I wasn't sure how to use this at first but I caught along very quickly! I would recommend this to everybody! even at my school we have a pintrest club!
B008476HBM|5.0|What a great classic Jane Austin story.  A pleasure to be able to read on my iPad. I can read it over and over again
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game teaches you the skills to be smart with your money and to conserve natural resources. it is a learning game but it just feels like games.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I read the trilogy during a very rainy vacation at the beach with not much else to do. The first book had a little bit of promise - this one did not.
0062197266|4.0|Just finished Into The Darkest Corner, which I could hardly put down. For me, it was a real page turner, which kept my interest from beginning to end. Personally, I had no trouble with the back and forth format, which went from past to present throughout the book. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a unique way to tell the story.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint of heart. It has many scary and evil moments caused by one of the meanest and most deranged antagonists I've ever encountered in any book I've read. All along, I kept routing for Catherine, the main character, to somehow overcome her anxiety issues brought on by a relationship gone very bad, and finally, in one way or the other, rid herself of the person who was mentally destroying her.<br /><br />I understand this is Elizabeth Haynes first novel. What a terrific debut!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read all three books while on a very rainy vacation at the beach. There was really nothing else to do.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|Fascinating reading...I'm now thinking about everything I do habitually in a different way! Explains lots of things I've noticed but hadn't previously understood!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Este es un clasico del cine para mi gusto, trae todo lo que se detalle en la descripcion, el envio fue rapido
B0009HAHD4|4.0|My first eyecup has been broken so I bought this. This is actually the exact same one with before. It's good.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Game was excellent and played well. The minor and occasional slow down in gameplay was not an issue because the game was addicting and fun. The fun stopped once, after I made significant progress, it randomly reset all my progress and data to zero...starting back at the beginning. This is a huge glitch and the developers seem hard to contact. The glitches is made worse when you search the Internet and find many others with the same issue, a lot who have paid money for upgrades and are left with nothing in return after their game resets. Enjoy it if you want but don't get upset when it resets after you decide to charge your kindle as well.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I purchased this for my Son and he loved it, light weight, easy to read, especial the glow in the dark option.
1609611543|5.0|I haven't finished reading the book yet. However, I cut down wheat for two weeks. (This is coming from a person who has always eaten whatever she wanted and has never followed a diet.) I added it again and WOW! I can't believe I've been living my life that way: foggy mind, depressed, low energy. I don't need to finish reading this book (although I will!!) to know that there is something nasty about wheat or gluten or BOTH.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You have to read this book it is awesome I love it I can not wait to read the next hunger games book. Suzanne Collins is the best author ever!!!!!!!!! Till you read this book you haven't lived. All so you should read the first hunger games book so you can understand the hunger games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I let my grandsons download the game onto my Kindle Fire, and they are loving it! Even my 5 year old grandson is having so much fun creating his house!
B0050DZN4K|1.0|This app forced me to rate it. While using it, I keep getting requests to rate. So here it is, 1 star for being annoying.
B0091VTISO|3.0|I watched this because my sister likes the lead actor who was in some Stargate TV show. He shouldn't quit his day job. While the film does have fairly decent production value, it falls a bit flat in that it just seems a bit formulaic. The actor doesn't quite fill the sandals of the Arnold rendition of Conan, and almost seems amused in some scenes that he is even there. He just doesn't measure up to the larger-than-life, and stronger-than-a-bull stereotype of the Conan character. Action scenes are plentiful and well-choreographed, and cinematography satisfactory. I just couldn't past a sense of people playacting in costume.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I'm hooked! Very fun and free.I have had no issues with the game and the graphics are great! I would recommend this game to any one.And you can play with your Facebook friends
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It's a perfect remake, in my opinion. I bawled my eyes out all over again. I really really loved it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|3/31/13 11:00 AM Phil Brase: Familiar with the request under INC 766724 because we know the cable is working on Slot 6 Port 5, where it is now.  But know that ESG is trying to figure out why it's not working in Port 1.  Will approve the RFA that's created for this to provide Escort to EMC on

B00A4OALL0|5.0|We have only few Masters alive at one time,a quota of sorts . Wayne is approaching 80 so every moment is precious . We should be still and listen. This the way progressive music is suposed to be played. Vintage and futuristic at the same time . Perez,Pattitucci and the awesome Brian Blade &#34; is what it is&#34; . The orchestra and quartet is &#34;whew!&#34; Used a seat belt when u listen to this ,so you don't fall out of your chair. Behold the Master.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|one of the best shows on tv right now-very well done -great story line- i guess i  need six more words
B00A8ZZ570|4.0|With this venture ,Potter moves into legacy territory akin to ,say Wayne Shorter. I can imagine how good this sounds in person. This is expanded connected music,ECM at its best. I hope Chris spends some time with concept because this a good start.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered this item assuming I would be getting a used official PS3 Dualshock 3 controller.  Instead what I received was a cheap third party controller which, upon further investigation, costs just $7 used.  I paid $34.99.<br /><br />To add insult to injury the controller sent to me didn't even work.

0060755598|5.0|When I started my business, I did just what the E-myth tells would happen. I knew something inside that I couldn't put words to, but the E-Myth opened my eyes and now my ears are glued to this. I listen over and over constantly reviewing and learning something new each time I listen. I knew I needed guidance, but was very hesitant about 'hiring' a business consultant. Serendipity put E-Myth in my hands and on my CD player and now I am looking so much differently at what a business is really all about.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|So far I like it, I have just started playing and it has been fun to play, similar to mario bros
B009YP9L7U|5.0|this was such a soft version of 50 shades of grey. it's exactly what it reminded me of. i absolutely love the story! i just wish it didn't end so quick, i would have loved to keep reading!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I keep looking for it on best seller list and I have to assume poor marketing is the answer because it's great.  Good moral questions and well written, I thought.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It's a great little all-in-one tool, but obviously not a fine-honing sharpener. I used it on the dullest kitchen knife edge I could find, and it sharpened it well enough to slice tomatoes. It's doesn't give it the best edge, but it's a great start. For <$10, you can't beat it.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I hate reviews, but they did what they were asked of and did it well.<br />Also were very fast. got them when send I would.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a really good game I really like it it's a lot of fun I have fun finding stuff in the rooms
B00BWJARHO|5.0|If you're looking for an escape, you can't go wrong with this movie. Beautiful graphics, extraordinary acting and strong moral values that inspire make this movie  appealing to both young and old alike.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|An amazing story.  Makes you laugh and cry.  Read it in just a weekend.  Recommend it to anyone who likes a love story and tear jerker
B009VIZDLI|5.0|What an amazIng story teller! I had to stop reading some times and compose myself as I found myself bursting out loud with laughter on the tram.<br />Couldn't wait to have time to read it some more.
B003B02PF4|4.0|Nice to see Grisham back in action. Always enjoy his books. Well written and plenty of action. Can't wait for next book.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Loved the series and can't wait for season 4.  I was absolutely captivated by the entire work.  Very well done - could not stop watching.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It was a roller-coaster of emotions and I could not stop. I have to say it is now in my top 5 books I have ever read! I would give it 10 stars if I could!!! READ THIS BOOK YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINED.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|we love the walking dead in our house and awaiting more episodes to watch on amazon instant video. an easy way to watch the shows you want to without having tv.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|I admit I was expecting the worst and this exceeded all expectations. This is an outrageously expensive and noisy special effects orgy from Mr Jackson, having very little character or story development but tons of irrelevant filler. I found it incredibly irritating and unbearably boring by turns, and there was nothing original of any value to be found here.<br />It hasn't even the slightest resemblance to the beloved book by J RR Tolkien, (unlike  'The Fellowship of the Ring'). I think it will lower your child's I.Q. considerably, but enhance hyperactivity. Jackson suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder and has a phobia of silence and empty space, even when it would serve to enhance the narrative, (narrative? duh, what's that?). He seems to believe his viewers are idiots and he should leave nothing to their limited imagination, (he may be right). The overpowering, hamfisted musical score accompanies this hash with many familiar soporifics from the Lord of the Rings, (never shuts up, constantly reminding the viewer who's in charge of this experience). It was a very commercial, superficial and formulaic film, its only purpose to make money. If you love Tolkien, boycott this rubbish, and send this greedy director back to making zombie movies where he belongs.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|The show is one of the top 3 on national television today (2012/2013); &#34;in my opinion.&#34;<br /><br />Each year, the first 2 or 3 episodes start off slow, but the rest of each season the pace picks up quickly, finding a way to bind together the loose threads set initially in the first episodes of the season respectively.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The 21st century version of such books as Sledge's With the Old Breed from WW II -a worthy successor to its predecessors.
B00BESCJII|5.0|Surprisingly good!  We don't usually like movies about teens, but this one was so good.  Definitely worth watching.  I know it has been out for a while but it should not be overlooked!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This is a documentary about Jiro Ono, the world-renowned, master sushi chef. It should also be noted that this is a humanistic delight that touches on family, sacrifice, hard work, dedication, artistry, inspiration and leadership. Jiro has been making sushi for over 75 years. Sushi is his life's work, his passion. By all accounts he has perfected his craft and that earned him a 3-star Michelin rating. Jiro Dreams of Sushi tells the story of Jiro Ono, his sons, his apprentices, his accolades, his labor of love, his approach to life, his philosophies on success and his 10-seat sushi restaurant located in a subway station.<br /><br />Watching this movie I learned that the world's best sushi chef is (seems to be?) the most humble man I have ever seen. I realized that I can do better. My inner fire was reignited; I was inspired to do better. This was not what I expected from this movie and I have never been more pleased by being wrong.<br /><br />I work with small businesses and people looking to take control of their own professional destiny. While I don't think that this was the intended result of the movie, I think it just became a core tool I recommend to help people reach their goals.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This was easy to download and friendly usable for the consumer and works well with my kindle.  Learning more everyday and using it more because it's not intimindating
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Great story, wonderful performances, amazing music.  You will not be disappointed.  This is a must see movie.  I recommend it.

B006YC74E8|1.0|This app was horrible and does not even deserve one star it was useless and it didn't make any sense
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an amazing world Howey has envisioned, and so thoroughly. He takes us through the silo, its people, its mysteries, so every chapter is a discovery. The tale has a satisfying end that left me ready to grab the next tale as soon as I finish this review. Read it and spread the word, as I plan to do.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|This is a very good app to have if you have Minecraft pocket edition. It works pretty good on my kindle fire. It's really fun to get diamond and gold items. You should get it.

1476719071|4.0|[...]/    WOW Jamie really grabs your heart with this book! Travis is a brawler who seems to jump from girl to girl with no care in the world. He fights and drinks and super smart but don't tell anyone.   Abby is a cute little girl who wants nothong more than to be friends with Travis. There is just some pull between them that they can get rid of.   Travis seems like the type of guy you want to hate he is rude, and uses these girls, fights for the hell of it just to make a buck; but than when him and Abby become best friends he seems to change. He wants her more than he wants anything in his life; but she doesnt want herself to be caught up in anything that could remind her of her dark past!   When that past comes back to haunt her she believes that Travis will get sucked into the darkness just like anyone else. She walks away......................... My heart broke for Travis he is so upset and than tries to act like he is fine so that way they can still remain friends even thoughj they both want more. She tries to move on as well but Travis pulls her back in   Than it is like BAM! They come together and remember why they should be together! The end made me so happy. Good Job Jamie I can not wait to read it from Travis' POV! I bet it will be better!!!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Game is ok, it is what I expected...the bubble popping noise gets annoying. For a matching game, it is great.

B000GCFO08|1.0|Amazon has resolved this issue, please continue to read my review. Keep in mind though Amazon HAS resolved the issue. 3/31/13<br /><br />I received the DVD on time. When I opened it to watch the DVD the case was empty. All of the wrapping was in place and the security seal was also in place. I believe the DVD was never put in the case at the time of packaging. I was not given an option to replace the item, the only option I am given is a refund, 2 days after I return the empty case. Amazon has supplied a shipping lable for the return. For this reason I will no longer be purchasing DVD's or CD's of any kind from Amazon. I will only make these purchases from retailers so if this happens again I can go back in the store speak to a live person and get a replacement.<br /><br />Some people may read this review and think I am attempting to defraud Amazon. I could have removed the DVD from the package and claimed it was missing. This is not true. All I want is the DVD, not my money back. If given the option I would have asked for a replacement.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Very addictive. Game is free but the developer could have easily charged. There is in game content to buy but it is just as fun and addictive even without purchasing anything. Hopefully there will be a Beach Buggy Blitz 2, I can't wait.
B00AYHK7RU|5.0|I am really enjoying all the tracks off Bowies new album. I understand not everyone &#34;gets Bowie&#34; not everyones'  &#34;cup of tea &#34; sorta speak but any one who has enjoyed Bowies music over his career will surely enjoy the tracks off this new album.Props to Bowie for having Tony Levin, one of the best bass musicians off all time play on several tracks. Great album from a Great Artist!!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game has decent graphics. It doesn't jam up on my kindle and has a good number of levels. Many others I have tried haven't been worth my time.
B0001WGDXK|5.0|Sorry, I am very biased about this guy. I found not only his work as a composer and as a director extremely fascinating, but his life in general. About this particular composition tempo and interpretation are unique. I own few other versions but I found myself going back to this version more and more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Enjoyable game for horse lovers, whether actual riders or not. I would recommend it for children between the ages of 10-14.
B00BL62I20|1.0|I had suspended my netflix membership since having Amazon Prime. However, I'm going back to Netflix because every video I try to watch on Amazon is choppy and of poor quality.
0062014102|5.0|I am devouring this book like a cop eating donuts early in the morning when the stomach is growling most hungrily..
0385349947|4.0|As a young woman who wishes to rise to the top of my organization, this book has really made an impact on me.  I work for the quintessential boys' club and know that this is going to be extremely difficult.  The advice my superiors (all male) give me, over and over, is to:  \\"not make waves,\\" \\"keep your head down,\\" and \\"don't push.\\"  This upsets me and also shows the HUGE difference between the government's and the private sector's desire and willingness to embrace change.  Sandberg's supervisor, Zuckerberg, gave her the complete opposite advice: \\"When you want to change things, you can't please everyone. If you do please everyone, you aren't making enough progress.\\"  As a sociology major, I also found this book to be enlightening - cultures don't change overnight, but this book, and Sandberg, are attempting to bring awareness to the masses.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Great movie but I experienced difficulty trying to watch it a second time. I watched the movie on a plane. When my wife tried to watch it the movie wouldn't load
B00BHMETKC|2.0|This film was a  waste of time and of relatively low information levels.  It appears to have been gleaned from a Comic Book.
B001D0BLTA|2.0|having to force myself to watch it ... still not done. maybe i'll be able to force myself to finish it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|So many twists and turns made it a novel you want to keep reading. I was disappointed in the ending though.
6303534422|3.0|The case was dirty and chipped, but that's what I get for buying &#34;Like New&#34; condition movies.  I absolutely love the movie but decided to throw the VHS away because of the state.  I'll buy the DVD instead.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A touching glimpse into the emotional life of a human being. It is written in a way that makes you feel like Harold is an old friend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it's good for trips also its good for kids 12-16 this game is a little hard
B000HEWEEY|3.0|The film is excellent, but that's not really the issue here, which is: do you want the tchotchkes included in the package.  I did, so it was worth the price.  The Robby figurine is just fine and the right size to sit on one's desk at work.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin has finally come out with a new solo album.  A must buy for his fans.  I love it.  The electronic &#34;IKYOTS&#34; is something to get used to.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Just got my first Kindle Fire and really wanted to get some app to work with Facebook. I might as well just use the browser with how hard this app was to use.
0345529057|5.0|I have friends who have read these books and suggested i do the same. So far so good a great story with incredible characters and locations.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Not interested in just looking at my documents. Even if it's just something small, doesn't everyone need the option to edit a little?
B009EDYZBY|5.0|If you liked the first Alvin &the Chipmunks YOU'LL LOVE THIS ONE! It is cute, funny & Alvin learns what love & being responsible really means! It is certainly a great film for EVERYONE!!!!!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|As a sports writer, I needed an app that would allow me to edit documents. This app has helped me by leaps and bounds.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I must keep my KINDLE plugged in other wise it drains the battery but this is great, you get on the upper left corner your weather in your area & you can set your alarm to any song you have downloaded which makes it really nice. Waking up to your favorite song first thing in the morning! Yeah, great way to start your morning! I'll be using this on trips! Recommended for anyone (just remember your cord to plug in- but if the electric goes out your still covered for what battery life your device has)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Spends hours of down time using Star Wars Angry Birds to get through the boredom. Everyone should try this app.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|So far so good.  Have not viewed the entire product yet. The production is as good as I expected, however.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I could not wait for this to come out on dvd so I can add it to my LOTR collection.  This one started slow but got very interesting as the movie got on.  I can't wait for the rest!
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book has inspired me to change the way I eat in a way I never imagined I could. Not for the sake of weight loss did I undergo this change but my shape is being transformed none the less. I'm on day 22 of my first Whole30 and I doubt day 30 will signal the end. To no longer have those frequent arguments with myself over unhealthy food choices is, in itself, reason enough to encourage people to read this book. Cravings for 'foods-with-no-brakes' such as chips and sweets have disappeared and I just feel good! Read the book! See if you don't agree that this is something to implement in your life. You can do anything for 30 days and you just may find you wish to continue with the practices outlined in this book beyond day 30.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I liked this movie more than Captain America.  I like the marvel super heroes series overall.  They do a good job but Chris Hemsworth does an amazing job as Thor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read this book. It will keep you up all night - you won't want to put it down.  Don't read reviews that give anything away- full of twists
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This one really got my attention.  I always like to learn more about the military and see what these people do to keep us safe.
B001T33VX0|5.0|Bill Bryson is far from the ordinary travel writer, if you're looking for the edgy and humerous side of travel, this guy is for you
B005LAIGSC|5.0|This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole tiem you are watching it.  It is very well done I can watch it over and over again!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Love the look on life that he has. Can relate so alot of it that is why i liked the album.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I first started watching this series and loved every minute of it.  I can't wait for the third season to begin and can't wait to see some battles.  Very good acting.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so fun and funny awesome jetpack and kingly close if you did not get it get it!the gadgets<br /> are best and also Mr.Cuddles
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is based on a true story and it really is one of the best inspirational sports movies ever.  Sandra Bullock does an amazing job with this one.
B00942X8PY|4.0|I like the game for a secondary mind break. It sometimes seems I can't quite rotate the brix or accidentally cause them to fast drop when I don't mean to. Other than that it's a great little challenge game.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|When I realized the CPU on my main computer was getting near 80 degrees C during video processing I decided it was time to rip it apart and replace the thermal paste. I ordered a tube of this and replaced it, the temperature now rarely gets about 40C, great investment, and as an added bonus I still have a bit left for a 3rd computer repair when I get around to it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|My title seems like an oxymoron but this game as it progresses makes you pay attention to placement of barriers. Then you have to use strategy to get the pieces to drop before time runs out. I was lucky and picked this one up on a free app of the day deal but would gladly pay a simple price for it. Someone from the reviews I read mentioned the hammer that you get and to pay attention to when it may be appropriate to use. Definitely the best tip as the game progresses.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I really. Like. This app it's very entertaining and I spend a lot of time playing it the only thing that would make. If better would be to allow players to review the classic games here
B000W089XS|1.0|all faces are green.  Could not watch this cd.  may be piroted . Did not have any opening credits. upset
1878424777|4.0|Was a great book - what I was needing to read.<br />Would recomment to other to read for their own benefit
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is so intense with the romance with keeping you wanting to read another page. I couldn't put it down
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm am pleased with these books love to read more lol 2 thumbs up great read would recommend this book to any married couple
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Dr. Lanza has undoubtedly found the needle in the cosmos.  It struck me while reading this brilliant work; we all sense the pivotal play of consciousness in creation. Most minds cannot quite reach and assemble the conclusions he has, but now that his has, we can follow. Reality is a construct of the conscious, not an accident that happened along after trillions of years in an inanimate universe. Mind and matter are siamese twins. Without a witness to hear, the tree makes no noise when it falls in the forest.  Somewhere in his grasp of nature, there will be a cure for cancer and world peace.<br />Hal Arnest
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A history lover I have to love it even with it's minor flaw. Day-Lewis' acting made it a 5 in my book. He is phenomenal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Exiting, funny how could it get better?<br /> Awesome graphics makes the game come alive, the evil monkey is very cool. There is new upgrades, and the area is beautiful, even though it's only a game.<br />  Temple Run didn't have ropes to slide across either.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|I'm posting this review because I tried to run the app and it closed out claiming that Internet access is required. its a kindle fire. wifi ONLY. so what happens if I'm not near a hotspot? anyway, I connected to the Internet and restarted the app. it asked me to rate it online. nag and ye shall receive. not recommended for anyone who takes their tablet out of wifi range.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Law Abiding Citizen is a great movie that everyone should see. Jamie Foxx is GREAT in this movie but of course he has never disappointed me in any of his movies
B000FC130E|3.0|This book was interesting and I enjoyed the ending / theme that sometimes what you think you want isn't want you really want at all. I thought the book and characters could have been more developed... It might have held your interest better, but all in all it was decent.
0765334798|4.0|I think the quibbles about this book, as read in other reviews, are completely fair... but yet, it was a very fun read.<br /><br />The \\"meta\\" took us more than I expected; but hell, when one starts to get \\"meta\\", when can one stop? So, fair enough.<br /><br />I didn't think the characterization was especially bad, though it was not remarkably good either. I did love the dialog- witty dialog counts for a lot with me, and this was fun.<br /><br />The concept? well, it reminded me a bit of a video i saw in a museum installation of \\"Lord of the Rings\\"- this featured the fighters of various armies, and the AI they used to randomly control the behavior of each of them... and a lot of them had the sense to RUN AWAY!!! when faced with a fight. So, here.<br /><br />The codas added some breadth and texture to the main plot.<br /><br />This is one of a very few books i recommended to my mostly non-reading husband; I did like it that much, and think he will, too.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Whatever you may think of Bobby Zimmerman, this is a fun film.  It helps if you have previously read &#34;Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fari&ntilde;a, and Richard Fari&ntilde;a&#34; by David Hajdu.<br /><br />Bob was no saint - but why should he be?  He was &#34;in a space where no other had been.&#34;  And he had to deal with it in his own way.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|I discovered Gotye's songs from several sources not thinking it was the same artist.<br />When I discovered they were all from one album by the same artist, I was impressed by his versatility and his not being afraid to sound different.  Good pop.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|I love the hunger games, but this is going to be the best out of all 3!!!!!<br />Catching Fire is going to rock!!!!
1455502626|4.0|Nelson DeMille's lead character in Plum Island comes across as a bit of a jerk, highly flawed and kind of a pig around women. Turns out he's all those things. But you begin to like him and understand his point of view. He goes from caricature to real somewhere in the first third of the novel. He trudges through a case that appears impossible to solve. He asks seemingly ignorant questions during the investigation. And he probably drinks too much. He's physically damaged and possibly no longer able to serve as a detective. So super hero he is not. But he's smart. And the reader begins to figure that out. He's human, too. With soft spots. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. More as it progressed. The characters stuck with me. Now, upon reflection, the story still stands out. The details too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely loved it! I still can't believe how alike the movie version is to it! The director did a marvelous job in conveying the struggles Charlie went through in the book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game ..I've been playing it for about a month now..super fun and entertaining! Each new level has different entertaining features. It has really kept my interest.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|a wonderful family show. I started watching this show with my 8 year old and we are hooked. It displays good family values.
098555780X|3.0|this book has a lot of good ideas.  also has good documented displays that help with the process of making gifts
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As an ending like a Greek tragedy.  Reminds me of poor Odysseus who was just trying to go home.<br />Mary
B002BSHXJA|5.0|A ton has been written about this, so I won't take your time. But I will say this: if you're (somehow) new-ish to the Beatles or haven't listened to their music hanging on every note, then this is the best way to hear what they were up to. They mixed in mono and added very ridiculous stereo splits later when stereo really caught on and they (or their label) felt obligated to do so. But if you're someone who knows their library note-for-note, then this is a must for you. You will hear differences that will delight you and take you back to the days when the release of a new Beatles album was more important than anything, certainly your afternoon classes...
B002PEP4U0|5.0|If everyone could read this boy's story, I have no doubt we would all be better for it.  In the midst of insurmountable odds, he passion and vision changed his world.
0231161166|5.0|This is a brilliantly written book, full of fascinating insights into both, the processes of scientific endeavour, and those of life. It is, inescapably, full of molecular formulae, other diagrams and the jargon of science. Nevertheless, it will be accessible to the interested and persistent lay person who will have revealed before them the amazing story of how the genetic plan for the unfolding of our lives can be dramatically modified by forces external to ourselves, some within our control but others often beyond it.<br /><br />The author provides one example of those external forces early on when she explains how the suffering of those who lived through the German occupation at the time of the Dutch Winter Hunger of early 1945, particularly pregnant women, reverberated through the lives of successive generations. This provides a startling insight into how vitally important the first three months of pregnancy really are to the unfolding life chances of the growing embryo being nurtured in the womb.<br /><br />But beyond this we are shown how our genome isn't the end of the story with regard to mapping out our future existence: rather than a blueprint it is more of a script that can be interpreted in different ways and more influenced by our environment than we ever thought possible. Indeed, even Lamark's long discredited theory of acquired characteristics gets a tentative toehold on the road back to respectability.<br /><br />If you are the least bit interested in the intricate processes that shape all of our lives and the part that we, potentially, can play in shaping our own, then this is the book for you!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|In my opinion Ben has gotten a raw deal in his Acting ability. Well this movie will proves everyone Wrong. Not only does he Star in the movie but he Directed it too. Won A Oscar and Golden Globe and more.<br />Even though most people know the story and how it turns out, it still keeps you on the egde of your seat. I hope after you watch the film, you will see Ben isn't just a handsome man but, he has talent in all areas of the industrey. And I also loved John Goodman and Alan Arkin. Pair these actor's more. And do I need to say anything other than Bryan Cranston. We all now his talent.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|Loved how it flowed and the creepiness of the vampire. Finally a bloody vampire movie. Sick of those Twilight flicks.
8866137634|5.0|It isn't often you get a new tool which completely changes your work habits for the better, but that is what happened when I bought the Evernote moleskine notebook.<br /><br />Although I write by hand infrequently because I use my computer most of the time, I have found that I remember things better when writing by hand. I have also been a fan of Evernote because I can sync my daily journal and notes across my Mac and iPhone, and can read my journal from the previous day on the bus when going to work. This way, I have a good idea of what I need to focus on to make my day productive.<br /><br />The big advantage of the Evernote moleskine notebook is that I can write down my notes in the notebook, which helps me remember better, then upload them to Evernote, which puts them on my Mac without having to go through all the trouble of managing sync. It also has stickers which can be affixed to the page, and when uploaded to Evernote, they are automatically keyword tagged. (The tags come with defaults, but you can change them in Evernote.)<br /><br />Already, I am seeing better results in my workday: it has helped me feel like a much more effective person and manager.<br /><br />For this reason, I highly recommend the Evernote moleskine as a great productivity tool. To get the most out of them, you need to subscribe to Evernote premium, but if you buy one notebook, you get three months of this service for free by registering at Evernote. Without this service, it is just another moleskine notebook.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I returned it after reading about 1/4 of the book.  I could not tolerate women as objects in a chauvinist men's world.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|the only issue i had was that the cd case was broken-the cd itself wa good and the sound was good  trudy
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Few movies are worth seeing once, but I will watch this again because I'm sure there are things I missed.  Every actor played her/his part perfectly, but Ben Affleck stood out as both a great actor and seriously gorgious.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not into the show.  Wife was riveted.  The hd was clear and bright.  Our tv to amazon prime was wireless which caused some delays.  I bought a cisco wireless extender and that solved it (not sure why).<br /><br />...waiting patiently for season 4.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I love and hate these short stories, they are always to the point so tend to be fascinating reads however the brevity leaves much to be desired. You rarely get to see the world from more than one persons point of view - which in this case is a shame as there seems to much more going on in the world<br /><br />A must read however, great for a rainy lazy afternoon
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Forgot how great these movies were. I saw them when I was very young. great to go back and see Marlon Brandos acting as well as Pacino's and Deniro's.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|I recommend this movie because it has everything that you want in a film: politics, love, death, destruction, trust, and more.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Awesome game. Love  the graphics. Wish  it was easier to earn cash and peanuts.  I recommend.  Its enjoyable.  :). Build your own Zoo Now!
B004GYY714|5.0|Great for family and friend get togethers. Any type of music you want to hear. Easy to navigate and use
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Starts out relatively easy and then becomes more difficult.  Great Fun!!!!  Love the sound affects and the extra help from the icons at the top.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|One of Mankell's best yet.  Don't know how he keeps coming up with such wonderful plots.  Holds my interest like no other author has for some time.
0802130208|5.0|Not completely polished, but there is so much here to love.  You have<br />to read it through once before you completely know, understand and love<br />the main character, who initially is a bit off-putting.  After that you can<br />literally open up to any page and find something hilarious.  One of<br />the funniest and unusual books written.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Not as impressed as I thought I'd be. The acting was great, but the swearing was unnecessary. Plus the first scene was entirely too graphic and violent for a movie based on such a great man and an amazing amendment.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This game was great until I realized there were inappropriate images hidden. My daughter was sad but she will get over it. I told her the game was just not worth keeping. And I would be more than happy to buy her a game of her choice. We had the game awhile and spent money on their gem packages and had fun but I cannot and will not stand behind people or products like this. Never.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I like it better than some other g5 games. Fun hidden objects, not so easy to see. No timer. Makes it less difficult for us older players.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This keeps you on the edge with each episode and it constantly holds your interest.  Great acting and story lines.  Keep the episodes coming.  One of my favorite shows.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing as always. Everybody else fills in well. There is a sense of Lincoln's character and the politics behind the 13th Amendment that I had never been able to appreciate until seeing this film.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|My goodness!!!  This is one of the best of all time.  What fabulous acting.  This is a period of movie making when people could really act.
B005LAIIFS|1.0|I bought this special Easter dvd pack for my 5 year old son. It was supposed to be something the Easter bunny left for him. How disappointing to my son that the Easter bunny would leave him 2 hopping eggs that do not hop. How does one explain that to a 5 year old? I could have and should have bought local or not spent more for the special Easter pack.  And to exchange just the eggs seems impossible since my son loves the dvd and would not understand it being gone for awhile. Great! What a way to take a great day and make it one with a very sad little guy.
B001O8D47S|2.0|Meg Ryan plays a wealthy New Yorker whose world is upended when her husband has an affair with a girl who works at a perfume counter (played by Eva Mendes).  How Meg's character and her character's friends learn of her husband's infidelity, and how they help their friend face this problem is fairly entertaining.  Unfortunately for the movie goer, however, Ryan is soon able to realize that she only needs to change the focus of her life from pleasing others to pleasing herself--whereupon she instantly achieves meteoric professional and personal success!  The moral would seem to be that all good things come effortlessly to those who are both rich and lucky!<br /><br />I should also observe that an interesting aspect of this movie is that no man is ever seen onscreen--nor is his voice even heard over the phone!  This device, although somewhat novel, probably limits the dramatic possibilities--as well as limiting the development of the principal male character: the husband of Meg Ryan's character!
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's slow going if you're committed to not paying any real money to level up, but still a fun game.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|I don't like it. I don't know exactly how to use it. I really don't have a good feeling with it
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Really fun game like the features and how smoothing is people should buy it. Really good game looking forward to another
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|It's easy to use it,  but I don't like shark. That's why I enjoy it less than others apps ok
B003D513TQ|5.0|I tend to like period time movies, especially if there is some truth in it. I know not everything about Young Victoria was truthful (the word for word dialog for example) but this was a well done movie. I think Emily Blunt did amazing in the role of Victoria as did most other actors and actresses in this film. I recommend to anyone who loves period films.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this book based on the reviews of others.  I enjoyed the book immensely.  Many readers are calling it a classic but time will tell on that.  I do think the author will be around a long time.  I<br />didn't find any big errors and appreciate that. Many new authors seem to need someone to edit their books  which can be distracting. I gave it five stars.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I love this movie! It's not the best movie in the entire world but this is a feel good movie and cute. So it's great all around. A must!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Bought it for my daughter birthday. She's a huge Beatle fan and this compliments her Beatle paraphernalia collection<br />Great price
B003MAS9S0|5.0|I love this movie. So far its been the best X-Men movie I've seen. Really introduces the characters well. Storm and Rogue aren't portrayed by the best actresses, but you get a good sense of the world. Great introduction to the X-Men world.
0764169742|5.0|I have read it cover to cover and refer to it often. It helps you to look at plants in a new way.
146500632X|5.0|Calendar was exactly as I expected it to be.  It arrived in perfect condition and my daughter loves it.  I am pleased with my purchase.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't waste your time. Not good for real marriages. Real relationships require real work...not kinky sex. Not worth your time. I only gave it one star because I had to give it one to submit this.<br /><br />Mydollt@hotmail.com
B007R41E8O|3.0|Fist off you have to download files twice to install the game, but it also needs a wifi connection during play.I live in the sticks and rely on 3G for the most part.The gaphics are mediocre at best.The storyline was pretty good but the game kept popping up with &quot;rate it!&quot; In the middle of playing umpteen dozen times.This was really really really irritating.In fact I took a star off for this.I finally had to say no thanks and then come back later.All in all I wouldn't buy this game if I had to chose again.There are some very good games out there and this is not one of them.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|The only disappointment was having two of favorite characters die. I love the series but I must admit this really threw me. It didn't end the season on a good note for me. I'm not sure I want to watch it any more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses I have 22 horses when into on trips and I don't see them I use this app to relax my mind that they are okay and I &lt;3 horses
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is amazing I would recommend this to you because it tells you the weather, the temperature located in your area. Don't think you should waste your money? Well this is the cheapest you'll get to an alarm clock. So buy this now before your money gets wasted!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A sea survival story. This book has multi levels dependant on the reader. It is either a story on compassion for<br />animals, a story of  a spiritual questionings, or a story with a quirky ending - your choice. I promise that this book<br />will have a big impact on the reader.
B00BOLFRKW|3.0|I have been giving a couple different movie-purchasing options a try recently, this one I went with Amazon. I have to admit I'm disappointed; the DRM rules and limitations are far too complex and vague (I say this after a week at work reviewing legal contracts for a large company, for some perspective)<br /><br />When compared with other on-line purchase options, I find Amazon the least flexible. If you are a Kindle user, it's a little less restrictive, but there's also little point to buying an HD version of a movie to watch on a screen not much larger than a smartphone.<br /><br />I'd like to see Amazon either dump HD streaming - sticking with the more flexible and cheaper SD versions - or consider other pricing alternatives (like, using it as another incentive to pay the premium for Prime)<br /><br />The movie itself was everything I expected, though for the price, I would probably get the physical media next time, because I expect the commentary tracks would be worth it.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I liked this better than Captain America, but Avengers is better than both.  I'm still looking forward to watching Thor 2
B008ALAHA4|5.0|just a bit annoying that apple has changed their charger again, but i guess it's to make their laptops smaller form factor, so can't really complain that they are evolving.
B004JMY312|4.0|While I am probably too old to be still watching Disney movies, my friends and I try to watch this movie every year around Halloween.

B008220C38|3.0|Okay, I'll admit it - I could not sit through this. I couldn't even concentrate on the first five minutes. This is unusual for me. The costumes were sumptuous and the sets were incredibly detailed, but it was not enjoyable.  I will give it a try again - maybe.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is a new take on the other take.  It is different than what I was expecting but still okay.  I remember the original Oregon Trail game back in the late 70s.  I don't know if I need another time consuming game.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Shipped fast, perfect condition. Not nicks, or bends or scratches. Case looks straight out of the factory, brand new sealed. Love the series. This package contained the black and white version of he pilot episode, and the artwork is pretty cool. Inside the packaging it depicts the comic caractors on the right and their actor counterparts on the left. Pretty neat.<br />Cliffs:<br />Happy with product<br />Happy with shipping and packaging<br />A+

B008AK8FHM|2.0|A good portion of the book is the author providing his credentials.  While this is helpful, I really was looking for more discussion of heaven itself. All in all, a pretty boring read.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book the day after I saw the movie. The movie is very good but there are things in the book that I feel are important and are somewhat missed in the movie. I like that's it's so easy for teens to relate to some part of this book. Read it.

B0002BO05S|1.0|Tedious in the extreme. It's overlong, overblown, overwrought and constantly takes itself WAY too seriously.<br />Max Von Sydow, ...old enough here to play God the Father, rather than the son, ...AND with BLUE eyes to boot! Nothing else needs to be said in this review about any historical concern after that.<br /><br />It's all accompanied by continual bursts from hosts of unseen heavenly voices that swell forth over every miracle. (The \\"Lazarus\\" incident is total soundtrack overkill!)<br />The one single point worth waiting for in this whole endurance test is to hear<br />John Wayne (miscast as a Roman centurion here), yankee-drawl his only, but immortal line: \\"Truly this was the son of GAARRRRD...!\\"<br />This is announced as though it's the arrival of the latest waggon train from back east. You'll not forget it!<br />Almost as hysterical as Richard Burton's stunned mullet repetition of \\"Were you out there?\\" in The Robe. Why do centurions get all the best lines in this \\"Jesiana\\" genre?<br /><br />The rest consists of \\"name\\" actors standing around enunciating their lines in those deeply \\"serious\\" tones thought to be in character with the highly spurious material.<br />Like me, you'll be saying \\"Oh for christ's sake just get on with it, will ya!\\"<br /><br />Strictly for the tragically indoctrinated....one star just for John Wayne's single line. It's no small achievement to upstage and deflate a movie this long with just seven short words...
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Even though you can almost guess the plot and developement, it still represents the craft done by masters. Just the right mix of schmooze, wit, and &#34; blows up real good &#34; to make it one of the few I've seen recently worth the time; which is far more valuable than the money anyway. Watch it, and sue me if you don't like it! LOL!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|From the first to the last page, the story consumed me.By presenting a detailed time in history with compelling detail, a complex plot featuring a wide range of interesting characters, masterful writing sentence after sentence, and an ending that I never saw coming, I would have to say that this is one of the more memorable works of current fiction that I've read all year.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Another surprising example of suspense, drama, and macabre storylines all combined on network TV. Fringe started their franchise strong featuring gripping storylines supported with action and magnificent special effects that are comprised of both WOW anf grotesque. This season introduces the key characters coming together from the FBI, enterpreneurs, and even from asylums to get the sequential storyline started. Right through to the end, the underlying storyline of random events are all linked together with a sinister cause. A great show for those not feint of heart and are looking for something to believe in!
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|People love stories about broken people falling in love. It gives us hope that no matter how rotten and screwed-up our lives become, we can still find our soulmate.<br /><br />And \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is an example of this sort of movie at its best -- a heartbreaking, heartwarming little story about romance, family, football and mental illness. Director David O. Russell is in absolutely brilliant shape her, and he spins up deeply flawed characters who are nevertheless lovable and charming. Also, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are simply stunning as a pair of lost souls who connect over dancing and football.<br /><br />For eight months, Pat Solitano Jr. (Cooper) has been in a mental health facility in Baltimore, being treated for bipolar disorder. Why? Because he went postal and beat his wife Nikki's lover, losing his home, job and marriage in one fell swoop. Now Nikki has a restraining order on Pat, but he's still convinced that she's going to welcome him back once he gets himself back together with exercise and classic literature.<br /><br />He's released into the custody of his parents, and quickly learns that his dad Pat Sr. (Robert de Niro) is now a bookie, and insists that his son is a good luck charm for the Philadelphia Eagles. And when his friend Ronnie invites him to dinner, he meets Ronnie's sister-in-law Tiffany (Lawrence), a blunt young widow with her own personal demons (and more than a hint of sex addiction).<br /><br />Tiffany offers to help Pat contact Nikki via a letter, if he is her partner for an upcoming dance competition. But after the Eagles lose a game -- and Pat Sr. is about to lose his dream of opening a restaurant -- Tiffany and Pat become embroiled in a double-layered bet. But will their growing feelings for each other end up derailing everything?<br /><br />\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a movie that wears both sadness and happiness on its sleeve -- the characters have so much to struggle with, and so many obstacles to overcome. it just breaks your heart to see Pat's delusional belief that Nikki is just waiting for him. It hurts. And yet at the same time, the slow-blooming, almost imperceptible romance between Pat and Tiffany charms you into hoping for... if not a happy ending, then at least a happy new beginning.<br /><br />David O. Russell mixes together the right proportions of comedy, tragedy and romance, with lots of snappy dialogue (\\"You let me lie to you for a WEEK?\\" \\"I was trying to be romantic\\") and quirky stuff (Pat Sr.'s superstitions). And he films the entire movie in a gritty, realistic style that you don't find in many romantic comedy movies, which only highlights the raw emotions that his actors are putting out.<br /><br />Russell's crowning achievement is the dance competition, when everything -- both personally and financially -- is laid on the line. Not only is it beautifully choreographed (complete with a a rock'n'roll interlude with \\"Fell in Love With A Girl\\"), but it's supercharged with emotion.<br /><br />And the actors are in brilliant shape here. I've never been a fan of Cooper, but his heartfelt depiction of an optimistic, erratic man who has lost everything just swept me away. And Lawrence shows her artistic chops by playing the kind of role that many actresses twice her age could never manage -- a blunt young woman who hides all her pain until she's faced with losing love all over again. They have kinetic, dynamic chemistry that leaves you screaming for them to get together.<br /><br />\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is that rare dramedy that really tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you characters that are both heartfelt and quirky.

B00005JNJV|5.0|We are in a golden age of comic book movies right now -- and at least some of the credit for that goes to Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />This talented director was singlehandedly responsible for bringing Batman back onto movie screens, years after Joel Schumacher destroyed the franchise. \\"Batman Begins\\" explores the formation of the Dark Knight of Gotham, following Bruce Wayne as he begins a personal journey leading him to Batmanhood. Even people who aren't into capes and tights can appreciate this story.<br /><br />After his parents' murderer is paroled, young bazillionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) vanishes on an aimless journey across the world. He's taken under the wing of the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to train him to be a member of the League of Shadows. But when Bruce learns that the League plans to annihilate his home city of Gotham, he lashes out and destroys the League's base. Oops.<br /><br />When he returns home, he finds that Gotham has become rotten to the core with mobs, crooked cops and a fear-inducing shrink (Cillian Murphy). Using the company's discarded prototypes, Bruce fashions an armored bodysuit and tanklike vehicle, and uses them to fight crime wherever he finds it. But the League still has plans to destroy Gotham, and the only one who can stop them is Batman.<br /><br />Most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in \\"Batman Begins\\" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.<br /><br />But since this is a comic-book movie, Nolan peppers the story with kinetic action, high-speed chases and massive explosions, as well as the grim specter of the League hanging over the entire city. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (\\"Does it come in black?\\" Bruce asks with a big smile after trying out the proto-Batmobile), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.<br /><br />The most striking part of this movie is Nolan's delving into morality, and the darker side of human nature. We see that Gotham has a rottennness in its heart, but Bruce won't harm people even if they are corrupt and evil -- he might not save you, but he won't kill you.<br /><br />Christian Bale is simply brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman -- sure, his growly voice can get a bit silly at times, but he perfectly conveys the strength, pain and determination of a man who will sacrifice everything to save others. And he's ringed with a bunch of other great performances, particularly by the always-awesome Michael Caine as the faithful Wayne butler Alfred, and Morgan Freedman as the supplier of weird Wayne tech.<br /><br />There are also some wonderful villain performances. Liam Neeson exudes haughty moralistic chilliness as Ducard, and Cillian Murphy's angel face and giant eyes make his psychosis even creepier.<br /><br />The one problem: Rachel Dawes. Rachel is a sour, miserable character who seems to enjoy toying with Bruce's affections and emotions (she tries to shame him for wanting revenge against HIS PARENTS' KILLER). And Katie Holmes is shockingly bad in the role as well -- this pouty, baby-voiced girl is supposed to be a hard-nosed assistant DA? Suuuuuuurrreee.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is a powerful, gritty reboot of the whole Batman mythos -- and except for the horrendous female lead, it's an absolute masterpiece.

B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I bought the CD on impulse because of the catchy \\"Suit & Tie\\" song, and was majorly let down by EVERY OTHER SONG on the CD!!! Not one of them really \\"takes off\\", I kept waiting for a song with a good catchy beat, and they were ALL let downs. To all the trolls out there: THIS IS MY OPINION AND I'M ALLOWED TO VOICE MY OPINION so if you don't like it, tough, deal with it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It works amazing on my kindle!! i haven't bought a single song!! I just download the song as an mp3 and that's where I get all my music!
0060899220|5.0|Mostly war stories of AB getting going.  A great read.  I love this industry so enjoyed the book, but if you can't think about what might be actually happening to your food before it get's to your plate then I would pass.  AB...come visit Grand Forks!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I'll admit it - I'm a sucker for a good title and a good cover. And if it's set in Ireland - well count me in! So on the surface, this book had plenty of promise. And there were some good moments - at times I felt myself laughing out loud or cringing with despair. But that was just the problem - McKenna seemed to struggle with the tone throughout the book. Was it going to be an exposé of Irish Catholic orphanages of the 40's and 50's? Was it going to be a hilarious look at two people trying to find love, all while poking gentle fun at Irish rural folk? Who knows? I didn't warm to any characters - they were caricatures and I found the premise unbelievable. There were also some shocking editing errors which started to really annoy me - like the TV which was stuck on the channel of a very violent cartoon. Really? In 1974? In Ireland? Did they even have more than one channel back then? Surely Tom and jerry was as violent as it got back then? So without going on about it too much - it wasn't as good as it promised to be. But it won't put me off Irish novels, just yet.
0307352153|5.0|This book really hit home with me. I'm quiet, studious, and prefer small, intimate conversations to loud, raucous gatherings. I've often felt like it was wrong to be this way, and that I needed to work harder to be outgoing and sociable. Susan Cain thoroughly explores the idea of introversion, and provides ways introverts can use this personality trait to their advantage. This book is engaging, thoughtful, and thought-provoking. I learned a lot about myself, and picked up a lot of sage advice for interacting in a world that is biased toward extroversion. This book should be required reading for everyone, both introverts and the extroverts who interact with them on a daily basis.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I have Tricky, Luci, Tagbot and the Ninja. I think it is really cool. If you ever played a version of Temple Run, it is kind of like that, but totally different. This game is more animated, plus it is free!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This show is so addicting. I have watched each episode at least three times.<br /><br />The season is composed of three episodes that are each an hour and a half long (approx). So, it is essentially three short movies.<br /><br />The characters are engaging and witty. The season developes the characters well, showing their growth as individuals and as a team. You cannot help but wish you could spend a day with Sherlock and Dr. Watson as they solve crimes based on observation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves crime/mystery shows. Seriously....it is fantastic.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is amazing! I had Hungry Shark 2, but this is so much better! You get change your sharks and you can eat a ton of different fish. I thing FGOL has out done themselves with this game!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I am reading these free, which is why l am reading all 3. I am a female and am not enthralled by this guy though many seem to be. Hoping the last will be worth reading, and not the same sex scene played 50 times.

0307476073|5.0|I must have been intrigued by some review of this book I'd seen either on TV or on-line, so I placed a hold on it at my local library.  Several months passed before my turn to receive the book came around. By that time, I looked at the book cover and couldn't remember why I wanted to read it. It no longer looked interesting to me.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, I received devastating health news, which has caused me to look at life in a completely different light.  Many kinds of books I used to read no longer hold my interest.  I thought that might be the case for this book. Still, I opened up \\"Wild\\" and read the first page. From the start, the book was written in such a way that it immediately held my attention.  I'm not sure how Cheryl Strayed managed to make her journey so interesting, but she did.  I love her style of writing.  I love the rawness of her emotions and how she lays them bare with no embarrassment.  I just so needed to read a book like this.  I have to say, it's been about six months since I read the book, and it still stays with me.  I also read Cheryl's book, \\"Tiny Beautiful Things\\" and loved it as well.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is great! I am currently on level Super Star. I love all the gadgets! I am saving up for Sparky! It is free so try it!
B00A6L78YE|3.0|Contemporary rock music has been decried as an anachronism in the world of hip hop and electronica, the sonic equivalent of literature's \\"dead white men.\\"  All the trendy blogs and publications (or wannabe trendy blogs and publications) have produced at least one article attacking modern rock music for being stuck in the past.  But these same publications also happen to reward rock musicians who have an uncanny ability to ape past rock luminaries.  I won't go too far down the rabbit hole on the subject of \\"originality,\\" but I will suggest that if you make music using a computer instead of a guitar this doesn't make you any less indebted to those who came before you. (I'm often surprised by how much electronic dance music sounds like it could have been made fifteen or twenty years ago).  The problem with Foxygen's album, We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic, isn't that the band wears its influences on its sleeves.  It's that the musicians have yet to figure out how to smoothly integrate their influences into a satisfying sound.<br /><br />Foxygen's songs can be divided into two camps: one, contained pop songs and two, messy rock collages.  I'll start with their smart, bite sized tracks first, because they are the most immediately satisfying moments on the record.  The album opener, \\"In the Darkness,\\" melds the melodies of the Kinks with the horn section borrowed from Sgt. Peppers.  It's a memorable and satisfying beginning, and it foreshadows the album's fulcrum, \\"San Francisco.\\" (It seems as if a band like Foxygen is almost contractually obligated to name check San Francisco).  With call and response lyrics like the following, \\"[boy:] I left my love in San Francisco / [girl] That's okay, I was bored anyway,\\" Foxygen gets to showcase some humor and suggest that the band can fit both homage and caricature into the same song.<br /><br />By contrast, Foxygen's longer, more freewheeling songs are both more ambitious and messier.  It doesn't help that it'son these tracks that vocalist, Sam France, tries his best to channel his rock and roll heroes.  There's a moment on \\"No Destruction\\" that sounds less like a shout out to Bob Dylan than it does a Saturday Night Live impression gone wrong.  At their worse, these longer songs sound like snippets of ideas haphazardly strung together without thought to transitions or continuity.  On the song, \\"Oh Yeah,\\" Foxygen splice a Jackson 5 song into the middle of a T. Rex number, a combo that should work, but here it sounds random, like they're flipping back and forth between two radio stations.<br /><br />Foxygen's intense knowledge of rock and roll's back catalogue is at times reminiscent of sampling in hip hop.  But where the best hip hop DJs manage to take disparate sounds that have no business inhabiting the same song and yet somehow make them sound like perfect compliments, here Foxygen takes sounds that should work together and somehow manages to make them clash.  The exception is perhaps \\"On Blue Mountain,\\" which moves from one idea to the next, taking unexpected detours when necessary, but all the while building towards something greater than its parts.  This song represents the Platonic ideal of Foxygen in practice.  Obviously, this band is talented, and they might even turn in a masterpiece if only they could harness their gifts for the greater good of rock and roll.

B003N0XDT4|5.0|Audio neophyte here, but wanted rocking, loud, headphone sound from my crappy laptop. This does the trick! Completely bypasses the cheap soundcard and drives my ancient, used-to-be-good, Sony MDR-V600 'cans' hard.<br /><br />I was concerned that with the headphone speakers at 45 ohm impedance I might not be able to blast quite as loud as I wanted. However, if I go near the top volume on the FiiO control (very low distortion still) I can get what I want.<br /><br />Earbuds: This is also great combo with the highly rated, but super cheap, Panasonic RPHJE120A earbuds, though I can't quite get the same booming sound I get with the Sony cans.<br /><br />Cons: If you have fancy older style high-impedance headphones (&#62;60 ohms; google your model impedance), these might not get you up to the max recommended volumes, if you really like to rock out. Apparently, though, a lot of middle grade headphones are around 25-35 ohms, so should be fine with those or the even lower ohm cheap headphones.<br /><br />Note that this amp is only for digital sources, like computers, and you might want to try a FiiO analog amp for many portable devices.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|story was good but i believe could have been better. plot was a little weak. acting was good worth getting
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|Initially, I liked the game as the first few levels were easy.  On harder levels I thought that checkpoints would make sense.  I do not like having to restart the level from the beginning when this little brown guy gets impaled on a pipe.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Its a very good movie loads of action. Did not like in the beginning where they killed the man in the cave . A nice ending.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Such a great book. Read it in a day. Would recommend to anyone that likes a good dirty romantic read.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is really awesome but it would be even better if it didn't require a WiFi connection. I hope the game makers will make this a new update.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Such a great book. Read all 3 books in less then a week. Would recommend to anyone that likes a good dirty romantic read.
B000ASDG0S|5.0|Came very fast - good movie - interesting and highly recommend!  I mostly wanted to see the chemistry between Brad & Angelina, but it is a great flick too!!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|This is the second instalment of the Honor Harrington series. It continues in the vein of its predecessor, On Basilisk Station. It's a tight narrative, this time taking place in the orbit of a planet called Grayson. Much how the larger series narrative follows the conflicts between France and England around the turn of the nineteenth century, the ground storyline mirrors the Meiji Restoration of Japan. The story is built well enough that you can pick up here without having read the previous book. It's not high art, but it's a solid space opera to keep you satisfied on a long trip.
0802473156|5.0|Great book!  Very easy read...very easy to understand.  I found out so much about my current relationship and past ones.  I finally understand some things that had been haunting me a little from the past.  Thanks Dr. Chapman.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|What is there to say about one of my favorite crime-drama comedies? Excellent acting by a cast that makes you believe that they are the characters they portray, storylines that incorporate the intricate process of police and detective work, personal relationships, plenty of action, romance and sexual tension, and just the right dose of comedy to make you laugh out loud. Follow these characters as they solve mysteries, assisted by a lovable mystery novelist who uses his own 'criminal mind' to give a different perspective on the 'whodunnit' scenarios in each episode, while at the same time balancing his life as a top-selling author, loving father to a daughter who is rapidly reaching 'adulthood', (most times seemingly more rapidly than HE is), and, to complicate things even more, dealing with his growing feelings for the NYPD detective he is shadowing as a muse for a series of books he is writing. It is a must-see show that is a 'must have' in my collection!
1591391105|3.0|I'm sure it is probably me, but I have never been able to finish the book.  It is eye-opening to think about how the first 90 days drive so much of your future in that company, but I've not really applied much of what it suggested.

B008BZIUHG|5.0|I could gush over this release for days!!!! This band is what rock and roll is about. They don't try to make a top 40 hit, or use all kinds of vocal synth crap-they play what they feel and they play it well. Some of the songs on Head Down are long, so the new generation of 90 second attention spans won't get it-to which I say &#34;Thank You&#34;.  This music is meant to be enjoyed through your surround sound, awesome headphones or on a road trip. The bottom end is fantastic throughout the mix, Scott Holiday's guitar work is stellar and shows much more dimension than I have heard from him before(he is flawless on this recording). Last, but not least are Jay Buchanan's vocals. He simply reels you in, his style may remind you of other great singers, but his voice sounds like nobody else. Head Down is STRONG!! Great musicians, no cheesy lyrics and fun to watch. Standout songs are: Keep on Swinging, Jordan, All the Way, Until the Sun Comes Down. Best song though is easily Manifest Destiny pt1, this song is easily worth the price of the disc alone!! Just listen, you won't be disappointed. Rival Sons should become HUGE-there's hope for Rock after all!!!!!!!

1250006341|5.0|This book is filled with great information and pictures.  Even the book itself - binding, paper, and design of each page - is beautiful.  If you're a Downton Abbey fan going through withdrawals as you wait for the next season, then I highly recommend this.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|recieved everything it said it included. the disks were better than expected. definitely satisfied with this product and hope everyone has the same experience.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is fantastic. I didn't read this book last year because of the negative reviews. When I read that the author was going to write Travis's point of view I decided to read Beautiful Disaster and I don't regret it. I love every word. I laugh and I had tears in my eyes. This book is addictive. I can't wait to read Walking Disaster.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Such a good game cannot stop playing love it so much I stayed up all night playing you should buy it worth the money
B003EY7IUY|5.0|This book was as enjoyable as the previous ones. Madcap Becky running amuck, now joined by an<br /> out of control toddler....whose favorite word is \\"mine\\"'. I loved it to the final page
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It's a must read, a human look that expects you to love and hate the so-called protagonist. The biographer pulled no punches on this page-turning adventure. We see ourselves in Steve Jobs, even though he was nothing like us. Job grants us an intimate view into how we can lead, why we should hug our loved ones, and how to deeply value the intersection of art and technology through great products.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|This comes in a 4 disc package and 1 and 2  were fine and the #3 disc was interrupted with pixel problems and #4 was the same.

B00BL5EQLC|5.0|I got this game as a free download and reluctantly tried it out. After the first level I realized I was going to looks the game. after that I kept telling myself &quot;after I beat level 10&quot; ... &quot;after I beat level 15&quot;... next thing I knew I had completed all 30 levels.<br />simple jump, roll, change direction swipes. It kind of reminded me of a much simpler Mirror's Edge (ios) game. Lots of fun... Try it out!
B0015T6G2G|5.0|For me, Nelson Mandela is one of the very few great men of the Twentieth Century. A few more of him and the world might actually have a long-term chance.
B00164CM46|5.0|Talk about a diamond heist gone completely wrong!  This movie has both action and comedy, which I love!  'Snatch' is one of my favorite movies of all time.  In my opinion, Guy Ritchie did a fabulous job directing and casting this film.  It has all kinds of twists and turns, ups and downs. Warning! This movie does drop the 'f' bomb quite heavily and some other words that some people may find offensive. Other than that, great movie.
B00699SDR8|4.0|If you remember all those readings they threw at you in your basic, college  philosophy class, you know what I am talking about. If you are a college student, don't use the book as a substitute, but as a supplement.<br />The frame story is somewhat lame, but the important thing is the information.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|season 1 was good, season 2 is just as good so far. definitely worth watching, i plan to keep on watching the remaining seasons
B008XG1X18|5.0|Everyone should try this app.  So many neat things to try and also gives great tips on just about anything.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Was a very interesting movie. Enjoyed it very much. Guess there will be more. Good entertainment for sure. You should watch if you enjoyed lord of the rings.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie as follows-<br />movie - 4.5 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />great movie , video and audio all around on this blu ray.<br />although parts of the movie was filmed soft, there were great views that really popped.<br />a western with a difference, hats off to Mr. Tarantino.<br />highly recommended for your collection.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|i love this cd put it on my ipod. i like stevie nicks she has a one of a kind voice. she is very talented. hope she comes out with more
B0042GIRYE|5.0|Great songs. Wouldn't expect anything else from the Zac Brown Band. Every song will be on repeat. Well worth the money--you won't be disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Highly recommend this book to skeptics who think they have all the answers based on what science offers. Breaks through to a reality that forces us to consider how limited our knowledge about deeper issues of life are and other dimensions.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Fun game. Can't stop playing!!  Very addictive !  Great way to kill time.  Had a hard time getting it to download on my kindle though.  Eventually it did after about an hour.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Looks good on Blu-ray but I guess you cannot get the same quality as a movie shot now a days.  Better than just dvd, but not so clear as newer movies.  But a great deal.

B000000HHE|5.0|There are very few albums that i call masterpieces and this is one of them!<br />No one in my opinion ever put out album like 3 Feet High And Rising....<br />Its one of those records the you must listen to without pausing or stopping to do something. Even  if you were on fire fire you cant stop listening. The rhymes,the beats,the cover,the everything is classic i recommend this masterpiece .
B00BU2TEGS|3.0|I am a huge fan and avid listener of Depeche Mode material since the mid 1980's.  I have been to a couple of their concerts, bought all of their LP's and even have purchased a few of their Maxi Singles, which I do not usually care for from most bands/groups.  With that being said, lets get to the breakdown of my THREE STAR review...<br /><br />A lot of folks seem to be comparing this to their 1990 LP 'Violator'.  I do not feel that opinion at all.  There isn't a track on this LP/CD that doesn't remotely have any similarity to Violator.  In fact, this is their first LP that I feel most of the songs on it are stacked into the genre 'Minimal Wave'.  There just seems to be something missing from most of these tracks.  After 12 albums you'd think the 13th LP would be vigorously fantastic, but this one fails to deliver anything but drab (with the exception of the \\"Soft Touch / Raw Nerve\\" and \\"Should Be Higher\\".  The others are filler sounding tracks that seem to have missing electronics, respectively.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, all the tracks (except for the last one, No.13) are moderately okay with the exception of the above mentioned being pretty good.  I just think with Depeche Mode's experience and creativity, they seemed to give us a lazy LP.  This LP actually would have been 2.5 stars, but it doesn't deserve 2 stars either, so 3 stars worked.<br /><br />Overall, I hope their next effort has more spunk, instrumentation and most of all - a wowing affect.<br /><br />Lots of respect to Depeche Mode, though.  I just prefer their last 2-3 LP's over this one.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Since I get a free month of prime with my kindle purchase, I am using it to my full advantage. So today I went in search of a good prime movie and instead found awkward. I swear it was fate!:)<br /><br />I won't go into the story line because other reviewers have: But here's my take. Awkward is fun and not too serious show with a lot of meaning behind it. It kind of reminded me of Glee (because of the school setting plus the wacky counselor) but even better.<br /><br />Just watch one episode...you'll be hooked!=D
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Kept freezing,hint button takes to long to refresh.advertised as free game, not free trial, so not really accurate.Story sounded good in synopsis, but badly put together in the game. No skip button for the intro and fed up of having to go through it all,every time I return.
B001J3U22S|5.0|I loved it and recommend it to all dune fans. Enjoy.This Book is great for Dune Lovers. Enjoy it Lots.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love the game. Reminds me of the old tycoon games. Make sure you produce lots of food, the dinosaurs get hungry.
B000BC8STC|4.0|Vintage James Brown will not disappoint fans and newcomers alike. James and the band are in top form. Sound is good. Only neg is bad editing and camera angles from time to time.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I give the Weather Channel for Android five stars.  It is very easy to use as I can get the weather at any time and at any place.  I would most definitely recommend it to anyone who asks.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Just love Castle.  Have the whole series to this point.  Will looking forward to adding the Fifth Season when available.
0399160450|3.0|I love Clancy and of course have read all his books. But this one was tedious. It was WAY too long considering that you were anticipating the outcome after finishing about 1/3 of the book. I found it just too tedious. Did I read it? Yes, would I recommend it? Well, maybe in the Cliff notes version...
B001NA6096|5.0|The acting was a Master-Class. It kept my attention the whole time. The direction was brilliant and the proof was a sequel nine years later with the same director and cast. Now another nine years has passed and the third sequel is being released in May and the rotten fruit guy has given it a 92. These films are a rare treat.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The thing is, you don't need to be in a coma to experience unusual things. You just need to be a medium of some kind. See my own eBook \\"Visitations from the Other Side\\" for an unusual take on the medium experience:<br />[[ASIN:B00BUKGM4M Visitations from the Other Side]]

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Happy I read it. Excellent book. Loved having the knowledge to compare the movie to the book. Now I'm ready for watch the new movie.
B002ZG9968|4.0|another movie I enjoyed and share with others and lend to friends, whom also agree a funny movie and they have also suggested
B00797MB0O|1.0|I can't really say that this is a full review of the movie.  I watched 20 minutes and couldn't get past how awful the main character is, so I turned it off.  Charlize is good, but the character is horrible.  She's boring, depressed and just downright mean to her dog.  I want to like SOMETHING about the main character in a movie.  Sorry, that's me.<br /><br />I can't believe someone made this movie. It's SO awful and if it's not getting better after 20 minutes, it's not worth my time.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I enjoy cooking and sharing with neighbors and thought it sounded pretty interesting, thank you for suggesting and keep up the good work
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this helps me fall asleep faster and lets me think clearer, also I'm not as stressed anymore either over pointless things.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|I wasn't sure about this movie but I found it very enlightening and enjoyable to watch so have others to I am gonna continue ordering dvd thru you all
160774273X|5.0|This is an easy read and understandable path to follow for making great breads.  Ken Forkisk weaves in his experiences in life as well as his decision to become a baker into easy to follow recipes and instructions as well as basic equipment to have for making and sharing good breads.  This should be a great reference book for any home/commercial baker.
B00B23O96A|1.0|Pete was right! If you live long enough to be musically irrelevent you end up doing albums like this. This album aged me! I thought I could get through it telling myself this is Clapton but no luck. Musical ledgends should Know when to hang it up I guess. I am a lifelong Clapton fan and still am, but I think it is time to retire. Remember when he did modern interpretations of classic blues songs and other genres? No such here! This advice on retirement goes for Paul too. Don't waste your money!

There your survival skills will be pushed to their max all the while your moral and confidence constantly being lifted by the might of this American Powder Coat Blade.<br /><br /> - keep a tool handy, grip loosens with use. Consider the Micarta upgrade.<br /> - they should be charging $200 for this.<br /> - splits wood like a beaver.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|I enjoyed reading this! The plot was beautiful. I recommend this to every Supernatural fan!  It was humorous and sweet and really with reading!
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|I like the driving graphics but I hate that you can't get to the next level b4 timing out.  Doesn't appear the time can be lengthened - BUMMeR!  If you have the patience try it out. You might be a better driving gamer than me.
B002GJU54E|5.0|All of the Stephanie Plum books I have read so far have made me laugh. This one is no exception. Her Grandma, Mother, Father, and all of the other crazy charecters in this book are just what I need to brighten my day.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Recommended to me I found the book easy to read. It made me reflect more carefully on what matters to me in a relationship but also made me think more expansively about my partner's needs being quite different to my own. Certainly worth reading.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I love this kind of movie and this is one of the better ones. My husband even enjoyed it. So did the grandchildren. I bought it for me really. I don't mind sharing with them though.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I love the movie but hate that it keeps stopping to load - it is very annoying and know that it is not on our end.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|Former Detroit guy gets better and better,<br />this is so good, can't listen to it enough,<br />and what a great price, half of what itunes<br />is charging
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good movie;  A little too long especially the actual raid;  I'm sure the actual thing did that take that long.<br />Also I wonder how much of this were the facts and how much was fiction.  Regardless I think we got the idea.  Entertaining yes.  Feel good; Not too bad!
B00A757EFW|1.0|actually I don't really know I haven't palted it yet but I kinda assumed it sucks because pac man always sucks big time!!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Such a funny read! I'm a soon to be middle grades teacher, and I would highly recommend this series to parents and teachers. The comics are hilarious but appropriate and there is an overall positive message, although it's not crammed down your throat. I see what all the commotion is about and I'm definitely watching the movies! Already on book 2!
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|good tabulation of important world events, easy to scan quickly without wasting time - glad to have this service for now
0307591549|1.0|I assumed this book was going to be very informational, just like Stumbling on Happiness by Dan Gilbert. I found myself halfway through the book bored out of my mind. I am already a very positive person. If I were depressed and hated my life maybe this would help but it's no good if you are already a positive person.
B002R88G5E|5.0|A story of survival, tragedy, love, hope, torture, war, relationships, trust, betrayal and finally peace. A beautiful ending to a tragic love story over time.
B006YB9VJU|5.0|Using this with a [[ASIN:B008SAZMK2 Sony Xperia Acro S LT26w Black Factory Unlocked International Version by New Generation Products LLC.,]]. The phone came with 2 smart tags, so I have 6 total, but 2 of the same color cannot be assigned to different events, so I use the duplicates to place in different places in the house.<br /><br />As others have said, it would be nice to have an action to toggle GPS so it's only on when using music on the go for fitness apps or the car event for navigation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good game it kills at least 5 min in a very long day of turd hurding. it will stay for awhile on my kindle.
B007NWPB4S|5.0|I love the song. I'm going to use it in my hip hop class. My students' were thrilled. Good music.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|It is a good case, but it depends on the application when I want to use the landscape screen it comes upside down, so I just have to fold it like a book. I don't use the stand feature all the time because of that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game because I have it on X-box. I recommend getting it, it's fun to play with your friends on survival/creative and to make your own world. Just one thing before you use $7,you can only play with friends on the  same  Wi-Fi,  I hope this helped you decide if you want to buy minecraft.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I found the book for the most part boring and repetitive. I eventually became frustrated with his style of presentation and put it down. I'll agree that while there's a lot of truth or at least some truth to what he is saying, I do not believe that wheat needs to be demonized to the point that it is the `evilest of all evils'. I have Celiacs disease and read this book hoping to learn how to eat better. Since I've stopped eating gluten six months ago, I've lost 20 pounds. I can't totally give the credit to gluten-free eating as I had spine surgery during that time also. But, I am well past my surgery now and am still losing. I do believe gluten can cause a serious problems with those who have allergies, intolerances and Celiacs disease and like sugar and corn, it can't be healthy for any of us to consume the quantities we do since manufacturers put them in almost every processed food on the market. But to say that it's the cause of almost every disease is giving it far too much credit in my opinion. I think the cause of our health problems is much broader than just the few things the author lists here. Despite my opinion, the book is an interesting read if you have no knowledge on the subject and can get by Dr. Davis' broad and repetitive claims.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Just love it it is very awesome and cool and helps youha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you love historical/period stories, this show is for you! It's great to see how life was in the aristrocracy age and how things slowly began to change after the war. I love also seeing the perspective of running an estate from the servants point of view. Gives a different spin to everything. Can't wait for season 3 when it comes on Amazon Prime!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, had trouble putting it down! Best novel i have read in a long time. Great characters, definitely recommend
B002WY65W4|4.0|Every other movie shows the first few weeks of a zombie outbreak, But Zombieland gives us a glimps of life months or years later (No real time signature is given).<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg shows up with this performance, giving you a slight view of what to expect with &#34;The Social Network&#34;. His deadpan voice overs with awesome one liners really draw you in.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson brings back the same intensity of &#34;Natural Born Killers&#34; but this time the ability to comfortably laugh at his jokes with no guilt later for liking him. The writers really played to his abilities, and it shows.<br /><br />Emma Stone does play this a little too cold for what a grifter would be like. And even though you already know her and columbus will get together, you still find yourself hoping upon hope for them.<br /><br />(As of writting this Hostess was still out of business) I did find the extreme craving for twinkies annoying after hearing about them consistantly. When Hostess went out of business, I found myself sad because Tallahassee would not gt his twinkies anyways.<br /><br />Overall, very entertaining and worth every minute invested. Most of the extra features are hoot, and started to enjoy  those as much as the movie. and watching with the PNP making of feature was a great comparison tool.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|everything is ok just dont have time for all netflix was a bithday gift for 3 months but i took it off of kindle thought i nhad it on 2 other things can watch only 1 at a time  like most of games i downloaded, dont like that i cant get home town radio station on kindle . it is kneb.com. can get news on it but not radio.
0345529057|1.0|While the writing is wonderful and the characters are well realized the author is a fat and tired old whore who never intends to end the story.  As he rails at the ones who press him to finish the series he negotiates with a MegaCorp. If you hope for completion of the series it will not happen...it will be completed by ghost writers or cut short with a peremptory ending by the Mega Corp that has purchased George R.R. Martin's name.  What is sad is that George R.R. Martin has elected to castigate loyal readers for dunning him for more and leaving what should have been his Magnum Opus incomplete.  I cannot recommend this series as much as I have loved it. Most webs are not worth being caught in...
B004SH40BQ|1.0|Will not work with Scala rider and iPod Classic unless you disable the cell phone Bluetooth feature of the Scala. This is of course unacceptable if you want to hear music and receive phonecalls when you are riding a motorcycle.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book was well suited to a kindle. I read it in short sessions, giving me time to digest it slowly. The writing was clear and there were plenty of useful diagrams. It was brief and to the point, but easy to read.<br /><br />I liked the scientific approach to understanding how a habit works; how one is created; how hard is to get rid of a habit; and how a habit can be changed.  The examples were useful and easy to relate. I was particularly intrigued by the sections on engineering beneficial habits in sports and in work.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best game ever! My kids love to play this game all the time. I can't wait until the temple run 3 comes out!
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|It took me a couple of times listening through to fully appreciate how good this CD really is.  Eric Burdon is a true rock legend. Great supporting ensemble.  Eric gives them lots of room to stretch out. Glad to hear it' getting lots of air play on Sirius XM and our local independent station KDHX.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We watched the first two seasons of this movie on streaming through our computer. It was wonderful and the streaming was very good, however, we watched the dvds on our television after arriving home. The reception is so much better and more clear. The movie itself is excellent. We can hardly wait for season four.
