B0014JGDUC|5.0|I'm very pleased with this product (bistro crocs) I got it in the mail with in three days of ordering them which is awesome since I started a new job where I needed the shoes asap. I love them!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|plenty of different games to play and lots of variety.  some are easy and some are challenging. great game for all ages.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|First things first. I've been wanting this Bad tour for so long that I felt the day would never come and it finally has. I woke up at 7:30Am just to be at Target at 8am when they opened to buy this thing. Now that I finally have it I'm in disbelief.<br /><br />Over the period when this DVD wasn't available I searched the internet, high and low, to the farthest corners of the world wide web just to find footage of this epic concert and I can't tell you how many horrible bootlegs of this tour I've had to endure. The only one worthy of viewing as far as quality wise was the Bad in Japan tour September 12, 1987 at the Krokuen Stadium, which is available on youtube. It is an actual edited and directed show and the quality was like a worn out VHS tape at best. I dreamed of when an official copy would come out.<br /><br />Now we got this! This show is exceptional! The quality is super VHS with a good job at converting it to DVD. It looks way better than how it would look on your VCR but don't expect for it to be high definition or anything. I'm pretty sure some technical freaks are going to complain, claiming a better transfer could have been done but I doubt it. I've transferred VHS to DVD before and in my opinion this is one of the best jobs I have ever seen. You also have to remember this VHS tape is 25 years old! And yes, this is far far far better than youtube quality, trust me. I've seen all those youtube concerts this is way better.<br /><br />AND DON'T LISTEN TO THAT REVIEWER WHO SAYS THAT THE PRODUCERS FORMATTED THIS INTO WIDESCREEN AND THAT IT STRETCHES THE IMAGE TO MAKE MJ LOOK AWKWARD!! THAT PERSON IS A FOOL WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THE FEATURES OF THEIR OWN TV! This dvd is formatted in the 4:3 aspect ratio, not 16:9 letterbox!!! To the person who said that: check your remote or TV manual to fix that, man!<br /><br /> The real gem is the 5.1 Dolby sound and the fact that it is one of the greatest concerts of all time. A concert MJ performed for Princess Diana.<br/><br />My only gripe was how some of the show's theatrics were missing when compared to the Japan one. Like the guitarist with the crazy hair when she does her \\"Beat It\\" guitar solo, no laser shoots out from her guitar like in the Japan one which was so awesome! Also on this DVD there is a 10 minute interlude where MJ's band jam out while MJ takes a break/changes wardrobe. This was okay (Snack/Bathroom break) but I'd rather have seen a performance of a song that was excluded from this show and was performed in the Japan one, such as songs like \\"Shake Your Body\\" and \\"My Lovely One\\" but I guess even the King deserves a 10 minute break, ha ha! I also noticed that the directing in the Japan one was just a tad more creative and innovative. All this is not a bad thing just an observation. Nevertheless this DVD has the better set of songs and is a 100% MJ, no footage of fans (I'll elaborate more on this later) and I can't be any more happier!<br /><br />The performances of \\"Dirty Diana\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror\\" were the the best in my opinion. they literally gave me chills. It's hard to believe just how much energy MJ has! He just keeps dancing and movinglike a machine. It's simply amazing. Another great thing about this performance in contrast to the Japan one is that it included way more singles off the \\"Bad\\" album. The only tracks from the \\"Bad\\" album in the Japan one were \\"Bad\\" and \\"i can't Stop Loving You.\\" This DVD has all the hit singles from the \\"Bad\\" album except \\"The Way You Make Me Feel,\\" but the producers of this DVD were smart  and caring enough to put a performance of \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" as a bonus feature and it is an excellent performance that is in slightly lesser visual quality than the main feature. THANK YOU TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS DVD FOR THAT!!!<br /><br />Another great special feature is the fact that they have two songs from the actual Japan tour i mentioned and when you see them you'll notice that the visual quality is way better than thismain feature. The reason why they chose to give the London performance the special treatment is because the sound quality is way better because it was recorded on a multi-track. Nevertheless it was awesome of the producers to include some footage from the Japan tour that i mentioned.<br /><br />In comparison with the previously released \\"Dangerous tour\\" DVD, the directing of this concert was way better! The problem and only problem with the \\"Dangerous\\" recording was that for the first half of the DVD they show too much footage of the fans passing out when they should have focused on MJ and his performance. I'm glad to say that this DVD is 100% MJ!!!! There's no footage of fans passing out every 20 seconds like in the \\"Dangerous\\" tour or cuts to poorly lit and underexposed footage of fans like in the Japan version. The directing for this concert focuses all it's energy on MJ and the stage, as it should. This is the real gem of this DVD and why I would choose this over all the other performances available, be it bootleg or an officially released DVD. This is \\"the one.\\"<br /><br />As far as the packaging goes, it is a cardboard case with pictures of fans, MJ, and Princess Diana all over. It comes with a beautiful picture book that lists every single concert date for this famous and legendary tour. my only problem with the case is that it doesn't include a snap case for the actual DVD, instead you have to slide it in and out of a cardboard sleeve. Honestly every time I take it out I'm afraid I'll scratch it, so be careful when you pull it out and check to see if taking it out or putting it in actually does scratch it. The jury is still out on this aspect of the case.<br /><br />This is an amazing DVD. Buy it. You won't regret it. For the price it is an absolute bargain. You'll get chills, you'll dance and you'll cry. I know I did. Thank you for finally getting it right Sony (never thought I'd ever say that!)
B00000DIII|4.0|Learn & Burn dazzled, echoing sounds of CSNY and other 70's greats. While that will always remain an instant classic in my books, this new album sounds a little more polished and worked on, has a lot of great songs, and I listen to it straight through regularly. I hesitated on giving this album 5 stars only because I haven't stewed on it long enough to see if it's at the same classic level as their first album. Regardless, if you liked the first one, you need to grab this one too. If you haven't heard of The Sheepdogs, stop neglecting your ears and treat them right with a listen to their sweet sweet jams.
B001NKI60W|5.0|This is such a fun movie!! Meryl Streep is well, Meryl Streep, always wonderful. She's part of a great cast and you gotta love the music. The setting is so beautiful you just want to be there enjoying it all. There are so many times during this movie that you're smiling from ear to ear. It makes you feel full of joy when you watch it. How can you go wrong with that?
B002QAY31Y|5.0|I do have other dvd's of World War 1, World War 2, Korea, and Vietnam. So far this is the best WW2 footage I have seen. This set has 26 episodes of close up footage and interviews with veterans that set up certain battles. If your a World War buff, this is a must have dvd set  for you. And to have the great Sir Laurence Olivier as the narrator, you just can't go wrong !!. Informative,engrossing,and spectacular!!.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|this is a nice move about teenage heros.  The movie missed a lot of detail that was in the book, but did convey the essesnce of the plot;teenagers can be brave,strong heros.  nice movie for an evening at home with family.  the costumes are great.  really enjoyed this movie, looking forward to the next.
B008966SIU|3.0|They say that honesty is the best policy. As someone who *loved* 2009's Veckatimest and *loved* the two pre-release singles off this album, admitting that I don't love this record as much as I thought (hoped) I would is a tough pill to swallow. I've listened to this album a lot since it's leak. On the surface, there is absolutely no reason why I shouldn't absolutely love it. Sonically this is a fantastic record, flawless even. But while Veckatimest was similarly meticulously crafted, it had soul. It was an emmotional experience, one I could connect with. I'm sure a lot of listeners will feel the opposite. Maybe it's just me. Every indie fan knows those old timey Radiohead fans who insist The Bends and Ok Computer are still their best records. (they've since been topped by Kid A and In Rainbows, fyi) Maybe that's who I am in the Grizzly Bear universe, that old fan who can't let go of the old records. But what can I say; those older albums connect with me, and this new one doesn't. If you're enjoying the album, keep enjoying it; don't let other people's opinions cloud your own. This is just one opinion, from one fan to another.<br /><br />7/10<br />Key tracks: Sleeping Ute (one of the best openers I've ever heard, in fact), Yet Again, The Hunt
0307341550|4.0|....I couldn't do anything else but read until it was.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's first novel is a gruesome, but absolutely compelling saga, like a car wreck from which you can't turn away.  A beautiful, but very damaged narrator leaves her crushingly small town of Wind Gap in southern Missouri  to make a passing career as a reporter at a second-rate newspaper in Chicago. She is sent back when what may be a series of murders of young girls catches the attention of her editor.  Plunged back into her hometown and family, Camille Preaker gets more than her scoop. Like a good gothic horror story, Sharp Objects never lets up as Camille digs herself deeper and deeper into the sick, sad story she's sent to investigate. Not for the faint of heart, Sharp Objects is full of  characters vivid and well-drawn, if extreme, and mesmerizing, if bizarre, turns of events. A dark, dark psychological thriller, this tale is good to the very last red and clotted drop.<br /><br />I reserve a fifth star only for my truly coveted reads. This was delicious escapism; not a work of literary genius, but something you'll read well past your bedtime.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307341550 Sharp Objects: A Novel]]
B005SCSL56|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down and finished it in a week.  Every moment I had, my nose was in this book.  I could not wait to see what was to become of the twins and loved all of the story telling.  Even though this is basically a fairy tale, all ages can enjoy it as I, myself am far from a youngster (my children are all grown-up).  I am a fan of Chris on Glee and am excited about this book and hope to see more from him.  I was fascinated at the way Chris combined all the different tales into one story.  Apart from Glee, one of my favorite TV Shows is Once Upon a Time and this book reminded me of that show.  Thank you Chris for a great story.

1401233791|5.0|As the new Batman movie rises to fame in the theaters, fans from all over, new and old, are interested in reading, or re-reading, the story that inspired the movie itself. Spanning Batman 491-500 and Detective Comics 659-666, Knightfall follows Batman in his quest to stop Bane, and Batman's subsequent defeat and approval of his replacement. This new version of the Knightfall TPB starts off with the Vengeance of Bane Special #1 in which you learn of Bane's past at the Santa Prisca prison and his hatred for a caped crusader he's never met and the desire to rule a town he's never been to. Fast-forward to Batman #491 and Detective Comics #659 and we bounce around between those two series as Batman and Robin are forced to deal with Bane's prison escape, and Bane's hand at letting everyone in Arkham Asylum out loose in Gotham. As chaos ensues, Batman (already in bad shape , is forced to mop up and take everyone he can in as quickly as possible before the kill count rises any more. However, it all leads to Batman #497 where Bane's evil plan to break the bat comes to its peak. The evil mastermind of crime takes advantage of Batman's sheer lack of strength and energy and uses it to break him and show the people of Gotham that Batman is no more. As Bane finally gets a hold on Batman, Gotham goes into a frenzy as crime shoots through the roof and the police are unable to handle it.<br /><br />We learn in Showcase '93 #7-8 of Batman's attempt at bringing Harvey Dent back into the Asylum prior to his encounter with Bane, and in Batman: Shadow of the Bat #16-18, we learns of Scarecrow's origins and his grand scheme that puts the new Batman, formerly Azrael, in charge of cleaning up the mess that Bane has created. However, Jean-Paul's Batman doesn't have time for sidekicks and he surely doesn't have time to hold back on the murderers and thugs of Gotham.<br /><br />One of Batman's greatest stories ever told is reprinted here in a more complete volume that spans over 600 pages! Although you get a whole mess of content to read through, you're still left wondering who in the world this Azrael guy is and why Bruce is messed up already as you're barely into the first issue. Also, you get no introduction to Azrael's partners nor an origin to Bane's venom toxin. However, you do get a lot of content that makes the story fairly easy to follow despite the few missing links. The art's consistently nice aside from perhaps the Two-Face and Scarecrow story arcs. The writing is superb with every page making you want to keep it turning and the eventual breaking of the Batman as powerful an image as ever. This is definitely a story to read even if you just jumped into the New 52 era of Batman. Seeing Jean-Paul become Batman makes you start to hate him as he turns more and more into a villain instead of a Batman-clone. His desire to take over what Bruce has becomes a scary reality to what Tim Drake has to face while Bruce is confined to a wheelchair. However, the entire book really makes you think about what Gotham would be if Batman were to suddenly cease to exist and how easily a maniac like Bane could take over.<br /><br />The book comes with all the comic covers as well as the Batman #500 variant and the Knightfall TPB covers as well. So, there isn't a whole lot of extras but they're there. Overall, definitely a book to get for a classic story!hough you get a whole mess of content to read through, you're still left wondering who in the world this Azrael guy is and why Bruce is messed up already as you're barely into the first issue.

0240816250|5.0|I have been returning to my black and white roots, from off and on  periods of painting. This book is a great way to re familiarize yourself with the very tenets of B&W, good exposure, negative development, and printing. A tremendous purchase.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I chose this rating because this was a book i could sit all day and read without being bord . the book was a very suspenceful the book  had me wanting  to read more to see what happens and the book managed to keep me from being bord.it was intersting ,exciting ,adventurous and it catched my attension
B008QDCZJ2|5.0|The product info; Elysium Limited Edition comes in a sturdy box which includes lyric & credit booklet, two cd's one of the entire album and the second with the instrumentals of the entire album housed in cardboard sleeves.<br /><br />The content: Elysium opens with \\"Leaving\\" which sets the overall atmosphere for the rest of the album. The songs and arrangements are soothing as they are sharp and incisive in lyrical content in tracks such as \\"Your Early Stuff\\" ,\\"Ego Music\\", or breathtakingly heartbreaking on tracks such as \\"Invisible\\" and \\"Breathing Space\\". There is also upbeat tracks like \\"Face Like That\\" which is vintage PSB and should please that faction of the PSB fan base.However PSB steer clear from the vintage disco electronica and gets back on track with Elysium's pastoral and down-tempo musical arrangements and themes. This album finds the PSB very introspective and meditative on subjects as aging, relevancy, pop celebrity culture,personal shortcomings and death. In other words this is a release meant more for the head than the feet. Although not as intricate and varied as \\"Behavior\\" \\"Elysium\\" has the same melancholic execution in theme and sound.  The second CD of instrumentals provide \\"Elysium\\" another dimension of beauty and provides musical gravitas. I disagree with people reviewing this album as \\"phoned in\\" by PSB. This is a deliberately themed and musically arranged album to invoke another response from the listener and that response is to listen sit back and enjoy an album that is a perfect soundtrack for the change of season into Fall metaphorically and literally speaking. There have been rumors this may be the last PSB album and those rumors have been exacerbated by the the track \\"Requiem in Denim and Leopard Skin\\". I for one perish the thought! So for all complaining enjoy PSB while they are still around.
B008602KQI|3.0|Its OK.<br /><br />Toska<br /><br />Russian - Vladmir Nabokov describes it best: \\"No single word in English renders all the shades of toska. At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.\\"

B00004TDTO|5.0|The DVD came and played perfectly on my outdoor projection system and everyone loved it! Packaging was clean and it arrived within a few days.
1451648537|5.0|Bought a copy of the book even though I had already read it. It's  a great inside look at an incredible life, with all the blemishes and triumphs. Steve comes across as a visionary and driven perfectionist as he pursues the legacy of Apple. He is so forceful and sure of himself in the business world, and it's only in the last couple of chapters that he becomes vulnerable and humanized. A wonderful insider look at the genius of the man and his ideas.
B004C03L4G|5.0|This book is beautifully compiled, with messages that really speak to you. Such a great way to start or finish off your day. Doreen is an amazing inspiration - just love her!
B00466HM28|5.0|Akai Pro MPK Mini has been a hit since my son got it a few weeks back. He has been able to program it and work with it in Ableton with no problems. Size is perfect for his desk and item works great. The price went up when I finally decided it buy it for him about $10 but compared to local stores in the area it was still about $20 cheaper here on Amazon.<br />It also came with a coupon for a discount for purchasing Ableton via Akai.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|one of the few that stand out for a tabet; I expected a half rate game but this one was pretty entertaining for those long drives.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has a little bit of everything.  Sci-Fi, the 80's, romance, thriller and mystery.  I was a fun and sadly a quick read.  It is very hard to put this book down. It was a ride back to a great decade this a futuristic twist!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is one of those apps that you spend hours browsing when it feels like minutes. I give it only four stars as the search functions are not as helpful as I would like. As far as I can tell, there is no advanced searching options, or much searching options at all for Kindle Fire. I do not know if this is the same for other devices. I also wish it was easier to pin items directly from the web. Once again this could simply be a Kindle Fire issue.
B001BANK32|5.0|King's fast-paced psycho thriller remains highly enjoyable even after being 30+ years old! I had seen the Kubrick movie and had always wanted to read the book. As is typical of King's characters, you get so much more backstory in the books than is in any way possible in a movie, not to mention the fact that Kubrick took the story in a very different direction in his movie. Would highly recommend for King fans and for those readers who would like<br />to know more about why Jack Torrance is who he is and learn more about the Stanley Hotel itself.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|nice to hear the progression this artist has made since \\"Drawing Blood\\". Intelligently written lyrics and good instermentation throughout. Nice to see Andy Summers involved in a few tracks too as Gotye sounds a bit like The Police at times. This is real good soft rock and highly recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is very good for easy stuff like exponents, but its no good for fractions. negatives, decimals, adding subtracting multiplying and dividing are included! Hooray Math!!!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There seems to be no shortage of excellent reviews so I will keep this short.  If you are a fan of sci-fi buy this book.  I am a complete sci-fi geek so this book or should I say series was a very pleasent surprise.  I bought the Omnibus edition and about half-way through the first \\"book\\" I did not have high hopes but the irony and suspense that saturates this series kept me reading and by the end of book three I was hooked.<br /><br /> A unique setting and fun plot build to a climax that answers many questions and leaves quite a few pending.  It has been mentioned in other reviews that Wool is destined to be a classic and I could not agree more.  My only criticism is that at times the author got caught up in character details, especially in the first few books that did not seem to be relevant and slowed the plot.  But overall great series.<br /><br />I am also about halfway through Part 6 (First Shift) and so far I am equally impressed.  Looking forward to more tales from the Silos.<br /><br />Mark
034580404X|3.0|If I were to rate the trilogy I would rate it a 3/5, but the first book 50 Shades of Grey is a 4/5. Lots of erotica in the first series, which increase my inner sensuality in our own bedroom. It's quite a Cinderella story that's too good to be true. It encouraced us to use sex toys for foreplay in the bedroom. It's a case of a young and handsome man who is rich and was once abused as a child and treats women as transactions till he gets hooked up with Ana. PS. My wife was the one who read the series, everytime she would read it she would be hyped up (mentally and sexually). It really encouraged us to use sex toys in the bedroom, and gave me insight on how to be better at foreplay.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read all 3 books! Couldn't put it down. Read all 3, in just one week. I loved the trilogy so much, I could read it over and over again.

B00005QW5X|5.0|Don't you know me, Kansas City? I feel so optimistic! Formerly known as \\"my butt boy,Tommy Gnosis\\". He had a fish emblem on the side of truck, he was so...hot! It's not Old Cyrus, it's Osiris. There's a great one liner every twenty seconds in this the new queen of the cult films. Great soundtrack, too. God created man in his own image, both male and female created He, Him. Does this mean that God is androgynous?  What do people in your town call androgynous folks? Mine too! I think some are going to be in for quite a surprise when they meet the Man upstairs. If they make it. The Origin of Love(split down the middle and hoping around on one foot) is my favorite song from the show. There's too much material to review, just get this movie! Yes I know what the title says, but it's not porno.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so many have reviewed the app already but to give my two cents i must say this is definitely one of the bible apps in existence. it has just about every version of the bible there is, allows us to share to facebook, has many plans to choose from, we can make notes, and now we can even have certain versions read to us in audio. great app.
B0089ZEEYG|1.0|I can't stand that developers rate their own games and rate them so highly. If the product were any good, it wouldn't be necessary. How many \\"moms\\" can tell you the code name for the version of Android their phone runs? And they know the exact model of phone? Sorry, but very few of the women that I know care about that crap.<br /><br />When this application had a sum total of 14 reviews, it was very apparent that most of the 5 that were five-star were written by the same person - same style of writing, some common words and phrases, and exceptionally good spelling and grammar (NOT the norm for reviews of phone apps since lots of folks write them ON the phones).<br /><br />The developer should be BANNED from the market for this behavior.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|PERSUASION is a book that I have read more than once and every time I find something I didn't notice before.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This Blu-Ray version of the Ring is stunning. Having seen it live at the Metropolitan Opera I would like make two observations: 1) in spite of all the hoopla about the staging this is a conservative production for the most part adhering faithfully to Wagner's conception, and 2) the video experience is quite different from seeing it live.<br /><br />Unlike the opera house, the video creates an amazing sense of intimacy with the singers through extreme close ups where faces sometimes fill the widescreen in dazzling, if sometimes unflattering, detail.  I often forgot I was viewing a live performance on an opera stage and felt I was with the singers in Wagner's fantasy.  These close-ups focus attention on the acting abilities of the singers, most of whom I felt were excellent, though some were less successful. The audio quality (more on that below) favors the voices and enhances this feeling of intimacy.  In general there are much more of these intimate visuals than full stage ones.  One does lose some of the sense of the overwhelming presence of Nature in these operas that I believe the much maligned staging successfully conveyed in the opera house.  All the scenery is done through light projections upon a movable platform, some giving the illusion of three dimensions, and this worked well for me when attending the performances, often so well that they distracted me from the performance itself.  Seen close-up in the video, the projections lose some of their effectiveness, especially when the spotlights that follow the singers overwhelm the background.  Also the projection details are blurrier, particularly so in Siegfried where they are extensively used, and where, because of this, some of the illusion of three dimensionality is lost.  However for me these are minor quibbles in an otherwise great video. The projections tend towards realism (often hyper-realism) rather than abstraction and for the most part I find them very effective.  But in the end it is the incredible visual intimacy which I found to be more compelling than in any other video version of the Ring I have previously viewed (Boulez, Levine, Barenboim, Mehta).<br /><br />The Blu-Ray offers DTS HD Master 5.1 and PCM sound. I have only listened to the DTS choice. BUT there is something odd about the audio quality. The balance favors the voices. They are crystal clear, beautifully so. Yet I feel the voices lack authentic stage presence. When the singers turn their heads or move about there is little if no differentiation in the sound they project, something one would expect from distantly placed microphones and normal in all other live opera videos I have. There is also little or no stage noise. Because of that I suspect the voice audio was recorded from microphones the singers were wearing specifically for the recording. This also may have been a way to virtually eliminate the recorded sound of the stage machinery which so many complained about at the live performances.  The effect is subtle and not very distracting and enhances the feeling of intimacy described above, especially in the long monologues.  Has any one else noticed this? I generally prefer that the orchestra be favored over the voices in Wagner and was disappointed at times.  An example is the Ride of the Valkyries scene where I believe the orchestra is the main actor, not the singers.  However the sound, at least to my ears, becomes more balanced in the quieter sections and the orchestral detail I hear is simply amazing.<br /><br />I rate this video version of the Ring higher than the original Levine version because of the superior sound and Hi Def picture quality.  The Mehta Ring was interesting but the weirdness of the production has worn me out.  I've always loved the sound of the Barenboim version and look forward to hearing it on the forthcoming Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />If I haven't focused on the quality of the musicianship it is because I don't feel qualified to make definite musical judgments.  I'll leave that to other reviewers. I can only say what I like and I LOVED viewing and hearing this production, both live and on the Blu-Ray video.  I highly recommend it to fans of the Wagner Ring but enjoin them to see it live if they can.
0307272702|4.0|This is a good book to have read so you can stay strong in the face of argument from well-meaning but remarkably adamant \\"calories-in-calories-out\\" antagonists.  You know, the ones who exhort you to eat less and exercise more.  Very interesting to see, in great detail, how the medical/diet orthodoxy established itself and maintains itself, and the mountain of evidence that contradicts it.  Taubes himself towards the end says \\"This is not a diet book\\" and it isn't; I would have appreciated another few chapters that went into more detail about the subtitle, \\"and what to do about it\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every beginning is a slow beginning but once you are half way you are hooked to the end. this book leaves you wanting to read the last book
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent. Thanks for making this available and so easy to use. Now i can read whenever and wherever i am.
B008B11R2A|3.0|I had heard great things about the XX and decided to preorder this album. Unfortunately, after one listen I wasn't too happy. It seems very minimalistic, but too much for my tastes. It's very boring to me. Maybe after a couple more listen through's I will like it more, but I am disappointed in Coexist. In terms of vinyl quality, it's great. The packaging is a bit flimsy, but still very cool and creative.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its better now then I can get on my kindle without the app.  I'm glad I have it.. I can pin from my kindle.
B00881VLCE|4.0|like the puzzles. and the ability to change difficulty just by changing number of pieces. looking forward to getting more images
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Look no further than any Disney/Pixar film.  Those are the gold standard.  Films like Lorax are ok, but just do not have....dare I say, the Disney/Pixar magic.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I had no problems downloading or it not letting me on it on my kindle fire. I am able to do a lot on it except for letting me make a new box, that's not a biggie i do it when i am on the computer.But I can like and pin away. Hoping those that download this app get the issues they are having resolved,this really is a great app.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|If you like Mahjong, you will like this. Many stages/levels to go through. Beat your times to earn stars to unlock more levels. Great easy to read tiles. Can get fast and furious.
B0089ZEEYG|2.0|It's really boring. I dont know who is leaving all of these 5 star reviews, but I'm suspicious. Even my 4 year old was tired of it after 5 minutes.
B0086700CM|4.0|looks great on my kindle and I'm able to see ahead a little better. wonderful graphics and very addictive. great to play to pass the time
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome. although my sister does not like it. people say its bad becuase they are comparing it to the Pc version. the game is great for playing in the car or when you are bored so I recommend you get this game
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great app. My daughter always uses this for homework. I was looking for a calculator app....and I tried out a bunch but they weren't that great as this app! Again, this app is GREAT!
B007SSEU9O|5.0|I Greatly enjoyed movie! It was a great history lesson. I had to google some of the facts to learn more!

B007VLHP9K|5.0|All suns must set. I never thought this maxim would apply to my twenty year allegiance to Karajan's performance of the Bruckner Fourth on EMI. The same comment is true of the DG alternative from 1976 and alternatives from Knappertsbusch, Klemperer, Furtwangler, Haitink and many others (I am afraid to look nowadays). If you need a new hubcap over the next few days, drop me an email.<br /><br />Squirreled away in this DVD offering is the greatest performance of the Fourth in existence. It comes on two CDs which in itself is a mighty feat even by Celi's standards. Sony trumpets it as the `Rediscovered Fourth Symphony'. In truth, it is a live performance of the Romantic in Vienna with the Munich Philharmonic which has never put in a better day's work. In fact, it makes his EMI alternative seem like a run-through. The recording is demonstration-class and by a wide margin. While the DVDs are fine enough, the CDs alone are worth the price of admission. Sony - come to your senses and release them in their own right!<br /><br />There is a deep alignment between Bruckner and Heidegger in their celebration of Pure Being and its radiance. Leibniz joins in the chorus with his wondrous question: why is there something rather than nothing? Celi is fully attuned to these considerations. Here, when the big chorale arises in the middle of the first movement in all its lambency, one is left awe-struck, just as much as the Apollo 8 astronauts were when they witnessed Earthrise over the Sea of Tranquillity. I have never heard anything like this - never. This is Bruckner as Creation. Not even Karajan in his DG performance imbues this passage with the same degree of celestial wonder. The slow movement is an excursion into the `forests of the night' and there has never been a more deep-domain exposition than this: Celi slows the music to a crawl thereby sucking the breath from the listener - and the climax which follows is seismic in its impact. The Scherzo is a bucolic interlude. Celi is famous for his `Stairway to Heaven' treatment of the finale's coda. Here, it is much better realised than the EMI alternative: Farewell to the Shadowlands indeed.<br /><br />The slow tempo notwithstanding, everything here is masterfully sustained. Nothing sags. Other than the Karajan performance of the Eighth from 1944, I am hard-pressed to think of any other Bruckner performance (in whatever symphony) that comes anywhere near this account in terms of sustained mastery and Real Presence. This is life-changing. It is Sign.<br /><br />DVD-wise, the Tokyo Bruckner Eighth is somewhat grainy in its visuals. The Munich Bruckner Sixth is better captured. All three of them are stupendous performances. My favourite is the Sixth.<br /><br />Blake tells us that a fool who persists in his folly will become wise. In Beethoven and Brahms, one could argue that Celi's ideas are little short of kookery. His Bruckner is normally exempt from this judgement. Here, his zany views are vindicated in a singular act of transfiguration.<br /><br />To Paradise.famous for his `Stairway to Heaven' treatment of the finale's coda.

B0091REZMW|4.0|I do like this game and its graphics. but it runs slower then any of my other games. the music and graphics are great.
B008OURHPY|3.0|Saw her perform live on late nite tv and was blown away by her sexy minimalist approach so looked for her music. This cd is all she has out... too bad. To me this disc does not showcase her talent in the best way. She should visit Lizz Wright's producer & get rid of all the effects & \\"tech\\" that this record is blighted with bc when she just sings by herself with her guitar, her quiet elegance is extremely compelling. This album is a swing & a miss for me so it only gets 3 stars. If Miss La Havas will forgo the slick, modern R&B production machine & embrace a barebones approach in the studio, I believe that will draw some attention from the masses & elevate her to stardom. She is too good to cover up with effects, Mr. Music Producer, so don't do it again to this wonderful artist.
B008EQIJQO|5.0|This was just a lovely film.  So different from your standard Hollywood fare.  It is daring to make something that is in black and white and almost entirely silent.  But we enjoyed it tremendously.  The dog steals the movie!
B008220B0C|1.0|this is marketed to young girls but perry is hardly a role model - she basically admitted on TV she sold her soul for fame and now resembles a plastic robot. she's inauthentic and phoney and there's a reason her sober husband no longer wanted to be around her. think about it. then think twice about buying this for your innocent young daughters!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book will open your eyes. And change your life. He explains the whys and how's but makes it easy to understand the science behind it
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I delayed getting this book because the premise seemed a little far-fetched to me. However, being a fan of Stephen King, I finally decided to pick it up. Boy am I glad I did! This is the best book I've read this year! Don't let all the blurbs fool you, this is a love story, and a great one at that.Stephen King has once again shown what a master storyteller he is. Get this book!
B00846REIS|5.0|I don' t know what the next book will hold but if you enjoyed reading Fifty Shades then you will love this book!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book is terrible.  The characters are just paper cut outs.  The repetition of everything from how she looks at him (peeks) and he talks to her ( Come) to how they get it on is just so damned predictable and dull.  Using the present first person as the narrator's voice is perfect, though.  The story never gets anywhere and is suspended in time.  That is why I will never finish this book.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Excellent work! I genuinely love this calculator!  Now develop us some specialty calculators. A real estate financial calculator would be really really really so kewl!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I pre-ordered Revenge and was thrilled I a discount price and still received it on the day of release. This show is amazing. If you want a show that is suspenseful and exciting this is the show for you.
0525953728|5.0|Anybody who gave this book 1 star is a COMMUNIST!<br /><br />The meteoric rise of this book is a celebration of capitalism, the freedom of speech, and putting bullets in the heads of terrorists!  Yippee ki yay!<br /><br />There is not a single word in this book that should've been redacted, but if the bureaucrats in Washington had been given a chance to edit it you know they would've struck a big fat black pen stroke through all but a half dozen paragraphs.  Unacceptable, Washington bureaucrats!<br /><br />All you 1 star reviewers may renounce your citizenship and seek asylum in North Korea where capitalism, the freedom of speech, and putting bullets in the heads of terrorists are not celebrated and such a book would never see the light of day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm not sure what every one is having issues with, my app is fine. It definitely keeps my attention and now I have tons of new ideas for all kinds of things to do. I love it!!
B0011BBA2E|4.0|Great bubblegum sci-fi drama! Some episodes are better than others.  Characters getting a little tired... what would you expect from Hollywood... Daniel Jackson?
B001OQCV2E|2.0|2012 is a 2009 science fiction disaster film that puportedly is about the end of the world. The special effects are quite impressive and the music is quite effective. However, here the praise ends. The script could have been written on a wafer. The acting is often over the top and the storyline is both predictable and silly. The dialogue seems that have been written by high school drop outs. If one loves great special effects then this film is passable. Otherwise, I do not recommend this thoughtless film. Not recommended. 2/5.
1401322786|5.0|This was another amazing book by Mr. Albom!! It goes without saying that he is an extremely talented author and this book is another success!!

Congrats on another excellent read!!!

B006VSP906|5.0|I discovered Christopher Hitchens by searching for interesting debates and lectures to listen to while studying for an Engineering degree. The first speech I saw was his defence of freedom of speech given at the University of Toronto in 2006, I have been a fan since.<br /><br />A line from that speech struck me deeply and stayed inside: \\"Don't take refuge in the false security of consensus\\" For me this line is representative of much of his work, including this book. Simple, direct, poetic and confronting. He faced his death with Courage, thoughtfulness, tenderness and an acceptance of the cold nature of reality.<br /><br />My favourite part of the book are his wife's closing remarks.<br /><br />\\"Christopher always has the last word\\"
B007XNAQLA|5.0|The double CD was good as was the DVD included.  All the musicians were in synch considering the shows were live.  Great music.
B008EL4YX6|3.0|Personally I did not enjoy this app. I found it to be just blah. But that's not to say you wouldn't enjoy this app, so feel free to try it out.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book, somewhat disappointing ending. Author leaves a lot of open endings, however I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series. Would recommend to a friend.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|Tempest opens with a little ditty that stands both out of place and out of time ... much like the music that filtered from the weathered movie speakers just prior to the matinee on a Saturday afternoon.  Though given that line of thinking, the whole album stands as some sort of black and white timeworn flickering beacon, harkening back warnings from a bygone age, by a cliffhanger hero we seldom take seriously enough these days, and should, because while he's got a different way of phrasing things under his setting sun, the unexpected weight of his songs are no less powerful.<br /><br />Dylan draws deeply from the last forty years, not so much taking stylistic detours, but bringing up and challenging musical visions of the past, allowing them to sound more important with his juxtaposition.  None is more evident then his vintage Tattoo You era vision of \\"Pay In Blood,\\" a song who's lyrics he gently spits out, a song that nearly begs for the rolling hips of backup singers to sweeten the old man's soulful moves, and ease his pain.<br /><br />Tempest is a haunting rogue's gallery of musical visions, commentary, misfortune, memories, and disillusions ... laid out like a series of paintings from the Lewis Carroll book, \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" all lined up nice and neat, only to be rearranged right before your eyes, casting a hypnotic spell that will have you shaking your head in disbelief while searching for a chair to contain the beating of your heart as you realize that Dylan's still out there with his amphetamine fueled visionary dexterity in tact.<br /><br />Even if we have been distracted from time to time after all these years, Tempest leaves little doubt that his Bob-ness, the eternal watchman, is still at the top of his game.  Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta put my hands in my back pockets, Betty Davis style, and stand here staring as this record spins `round and `round once more.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B008XG1X18|4.0|I've gotten so many good ideas from pinterest.  The kindle app is easy to use, I just wish I could categorize when I pin.
034580404X|5.0|This purchase was an EXCELLENT buy.  Bought it as \\"used\\" but the package was never opened.  Each book in this trilogy kept me wanting more. I couldn't put the book down! I love the storyline and fell in love with Christian Grey as I kept reading. It keeps you wanting more with the action, drama, romance (erotic romance).<br /><br />Great buy! EXCELLENT read!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack Joyride drew me in for a few reasons.  One was my familiarity with Halfbrick studios and the ever famous Barry Steakfries.  This studio puts out a lot of fun and hilarious games.  The one I was most familiar with was Age of Zombies.  Jetpack Joyride, albeit a different style of game just as fun as Age of Zombies was.  What I love the most about this quirky scroll style title are the Jetpacks.  Jetpack Joyride has a multitude of Jetpacks with various movement sets.  This added variety to a pretty straight forward game.  The main objective is to scroll/Jetpack as far as you can all the while accumulating coins.  Different Jetpacks[costumes] and coin collecting? Sounds very similar right? Well, this mobile game differentiate itself from other guys with its versed character customization.  Every coin you collect can be spent on clothing, Jetpacks, vehicle upgrades, gadgets and other power-ups.  With a few minutes in I had a wacky looking Barry gunning down the screen in a giant mech[Stomper].  Adding to replay value there is a pretty extensive achievement list.  Jetpack Joyride has a little bit of everything which makes it a good game.  The variety of upgrades and customization makes for a tailor made individual experience. Clearing out achievements are also a bitter sweet obsession. I absolutely recommend this game!

B004YM6JK0|5.0|Alright people, Supernatural...what can I say? This show is the absolute $#!+. I love this show. Have been watching since it's premier! If you are a fan of the show, let me make a suggestion......get all seasons on BluRay! If you have questions about BluRay, let me say,<br />#1 Awesome picture. #2 Great Sound. #3 Wonderful not having to leave the show or movie to get to the main menu (most of the time if you do select a feature, the show/movie will stop, play the feature, and best of all, will return you back to the point where you left off! BluRay has so much to offer, I could not put them all in this review...trust me, you won't be sorry!!! Back to Supernatural, what great things can I say, that have not already been said....If you are thinking about purchasing this series, I say go for it, give it a try! You will enjoy it!

B005PR422K|1.0|The contents of this book is so repetitive it's ridiculous. The same messages written over and over again just in a slightly different manner. It's as if the author assumes the reader is dumb and can't grasp the concepts. I found myself saying 'Ok, I get it already, so what about the HOW.' but it just goes around around in the same circles! Toward the end of the book there are some interesting points but overall I think there is a lot of unjustified hype around this book. It just doesn't deliver in every sentence like many awesome books do, nor does it even deliver in every chapter. Very disappointed that there are only a few valuable chapters in all.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Nice to finally have an app for kindle Fire, works well most of the time, but will start force closing.  The only way to fix it is to uninstall and then reinstall.  This problem only happens on my Kindle Fire HD, not on my android phone.
0375413405|5.0|I bought this book for fun after a trip to France....I expected a book of fancy recipes but it is so much more....Julia teaches you how to cook in the most efficient way for best flavor.  The food is real....lots of herb, quality ingredients....butter and cream yes....but the difference is amazing.  Unlike the American diet which is soooo carbohydrate laden.....this is cooking for the love of food and flavor. I have been cooking Paleo for a year  and I was amazed how well most recipes still fit the primal/paleo model. Protein...vegetables...herbs.  Clarified butter and some cream and cheese..... Just think hard before making sweets. I want to try to cook it all!

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Once again Gameloft creates a game that requires real cash to buy &quot;energy&quot; to play the game. Sure you get free energy every once in awhile, but it interrupts the game to have to wait for free &quot;energy&quot;. What a complete waste of my valuable time. Don't waste your time on this app.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|By far the best, and easiest alarm clock app to use.  I have tried all of the other free ones only to have them either not go off or crash.  This one has always worked flawlessly.  The developer actually listens to the users when they have a problem and promptly fixes them.  A must have app

B008CPZNL6|4.0|This is the best news and social feed app I have used.  The one problem i ever had with the app was after an update, but upon contacting the support they emailed me back same day and worked hard to fix the issue.  Within days everything was fixed and running flawless again.  All the information you could ever want displayed in an easy to use clean format.  Easily allows sharing to many apps, and one of the nicest features is that no matter what device you use your news is always there in the same set up.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book was one of the best I have ever read. . . It humbles you as an American and as a human being. What these men and all men and women of service sacrifice for us is truly selfless. With the Old Breed depicts WWII in a way in which the reader can feel each and every emotion alongside the author and his fellow servicemen. I would highly recommend this book to every American!

B000002LFL|5.0|I'm a huge Smiths and Morrissey fan, but I waited until just now (Sept. 2012) to buy this album because all my friends said it sucks. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The truth is, this is a fantastic live recording! Yes, I'm aware that several really good songs were left off of this album, but it is what it is. And for a band that was falling apart when this was recorded, they played and sang their hearts out. As someone else on amazon said, this album is a piece of history. I'm glad that I own it, and I encourage any Smiths fan to buy it. You won't be disappointed.

NOT ONLY DOES IT PROVIDE YOU WITH EXACTLY HOW MUCH BATTERY LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT, BUT IT ALSO GIVES YOU THE EXACT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE FOR READING TIME, PHONE TIME, MUSIC TIME ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION. SO YES, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS, IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU NEED TO JUICE UP!! :) BASICALLY, IT ACTS LIKE YOUR COMPUTER BATTERY ICON BY GIVING THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME FOR YOUR DEVICE. IT`S A WONDERFUL APP........ BRAVO TO THE CREATOR!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Five stars and almost 2000 reviews? Talk about a let down.<br /><br />What started out extremely interesting slowly turned into a big yawn, ending abruptly but fortunately satisfactorily. Reading this book is the most overrated experience I've had since going to Five Guys and eating an average over priced burger.<br /><br />To be fair I would say most future dystopia fans will enjoy it and I admit I could very well be a victim of expectations but a little more character development and/or simply shortening some of the descriptions of going up and down stairs and/or talking about grabbing/putting away the knife could have improved matters. There are some things that aren't logical which always annoys me especially when the means to explain those things were available.<br /><br />Having said all of that if there were a sequel I would read it.  Good book, could have been great.  Maybe the next one will be.

B008I3R2VG|2.0|OK, any music review is going to be highly subjective, so by way of introduction I am a fan of Britpop who loved Hot Fuss, thought Day and Age was generally great, and grew to like at least half of the tracks on Sam's Town. I do not like the REO Speedwagon/John Cougar Mellencamp et al genre; I therefore do not much like this album, which to me is very much in that vein. And the music aside, the lyrics are terrible; they appear to have been produced by a tired rock cliche generator. Listening to them makes me cringe, and just when I think they can't get any worse, they do.

0312427646|5.0|In his fictional account of Queen Elizabeth II becoming addicted to reading, the masterful Alan Bennett describes the allure of the written word thusly:<br />\\"...she felt about reading what some writers felt about writing: that it was impossible not to do it and that at this late stage of her life she had been chosen to read as others were chosen to write.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Uncommon Reader\\" is a jewel of a novella in which Bennett imagines the private life of the monarch behind the pomp and circumstance, away from the responsibilities and receptions. In this behind-the-curtain glimpse, we find Elizabeth estranging herself from her onerous role and secluding herself increasingly in books. But it's not escapism for her as much as the unexpected unveiling of the many worlds of the head and the heart which writers have created both fictional and non-fictional versions.<br /><br />In an endearing touch, Alan Bennett places a young gay man as the conduit for the Queen's marvelous discovery of the joy of reading.<br /><br />And back to Bennett's point about the sense of calling--there is indeed pleasure that Elizabeth derives from her newly found passion but it is overlaid with a thirst or a need that can only be met as she sits quietly, book in hand, lost in the words.<br /><br />I resonate with this sense of compulsion.<br /><br />As an author, I felt compelled to write a memoir \\"August Farewell\\" and then a novel \\"Searching for Gilead\\" as a way to help make sense of my world that had been shattered by a series of tragedies. I had to write. I could do nothing else. And I wrote almost non-stop for eighteen months until both books were finished.<br /><br />Now, I feel the same compulsion to read. It's as if the intense writing period left me parched with an insatiable thirst that can only be slaked by immersing myself in other people's writings.<br /><br />What a joyful imperative to envelop ourselves in the brilliantly crafted stories of talented writers, like those of a certain Alan Bennett.<br /><br />I commend \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" to those who create books and those who consume them.<br /><br />* * *<br />For information on Alan Bennett's \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" see: [...]<br /><br />For information on my memoir \\"August Farewell\\" and my novel \\"Searching for Gilead\\", see my website: [...]ose who create books and those who consume them.    * * *  For information on Alan Bennett's \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" see: [...]    For information on my memoir \\"August Farewell\\" and my novel \\"Searching for Gilead\\", see my website: [...]
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle and read it. As a lifelong gym-rat who just turned 49 I can say yes, a lot of what's in the book I already knew but had forgotten and/or stopped practicing a long time ago. I can also say I'm glad I was \\"reminded\\" of these things by the book as well as all the knowledge I now have particularly in terms of diet.<br /><br />At times I felt I was reading about myself. Even though I work hard in the gym I never bothered to track my workouts, nor did I track what I ate and as such I've just been more or less going through the motions with no real plan of action. This is now changing and what an eye-opening experience. This book does not try to re-invent the wheel. It lays it all out in a simple, easy to understand format. All one has to do is follow it and \\"do the work\\" as it's laid out. The plan is simple in nature but not always easy to execute. Do not get the two mixed up. You have to do the work and you have to pay attention to your diet, plain and simple.<br /><br />If you are like me you will discover many things you are probably doing wrong or not doing at all in terms of what to eat and just as important, when to eat it. Also, when and when not to do cardio. This information alone is worth the price of the book in my opinion.<br /><br />I took a week off to prepare for the change in my workouts and only started yesterday so not a lot of data to draw from yet. After my first two training sessions I'm liking the change. In and out of the gym in 60 minutes including warm-up. The workouts have been intense and I believe using an app on my smart phone will provide motivation to set goals for improvement and track progress. The biggest thing for me is the amount of rest between sets. I'm used to only resting 30-40 seconds so 2 minutes seems like an eternity but I understand the reasoning behind it. I actually did dead lifts today for the first time in decades.....literally. I know barbell squats are out for me due to my lower back but I canstill do leg presses and dumbbell squats so I can work around that.<br />I was very happy to discover I can do dead lifts with no problem. This is a game changer.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to start training properly or those who feel stuck in a rut and wondering why they are not changing even though they are working out and doing loads of cardio. If you fall into these categories I urge you to read this book.<br /><br />You will likely be surprised at how difficult it is to eat enough food during the day. Yes, I said \\"enough\\" food. When you eat the right way it is difficult, for me anyway, to eat enough lean protein, good carbs and the right amount of fats. The money I used to spend on booze I now use for supplements to help meet the dietary quota each day.<br /><br />I'm giving it 5 stars not only for the quality of information but for helping me focus and rededicate myself. The plan is in place, now I just have to work the plan. I also hope to update this after a few weeks when I have more experience with it. Cheers and happy training.

B001IYCMNA|3.0|The on board software is terrible and buggy in this product.  When I hook up this device it broadcasts and works properly, however, I am unable to edit the settings from logging into the default broadcast, therefore I have to use my DHCP table to get the IP and access it from the main network (once you set it up you can then get into it from the network broadcast).  This device has good broadcast range and speed and seems to work as expected for a guest access point.  I wish it had a built in Guest Login in screen (like on high end Linksys models), to enable guest you have to setup a VLAN and use that route.<br /><br />My biggest problem is the firmware!  The firmware that was loaded on it would not allow me to broadcast more than one network.  I downloaded the current version, I installed that one and then I could not change any settings.  All settings were there, but they were all default or not selected and when you would change them it would not save (I ordered 4 of these, and tested this problem on two).  I tried every version from the Firmware download screen and the only that worked for me (properly, allowed changing of settings and multiple SSIDs) was WAP4410N-fw-2.0.2.1-K9.  I tried all of the ones from the most current (as of September 2012) to this version, which was like the lowest, but newer than what was on the system.<br /><br />This system would be better if the firmware just worked!  I should not have to spend two hours trying to setup an Access Point (it should be pretty simple).  I also wish it had a better guest setup (like the Linksys high end models, where you could just choose guest system, and have a separate network).  In the end, these have good range and broadcast properly, but the firmware problems hinder this otherwise nicely priced and trusted brand system!

B0057PT2S4|5.0|To say that The Distance was one of Seger's best albums ever, commercially speaking, would be putting it mildly. His fourth (and last) with The Silver Bullet Band (his 12h album overall) came out in late 1982 (Capitol 12254) and by February 1983 had peaked at # 5 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts, reached platinum status, and was on its way to producing three Hot 100 single hits, including his best ever with the Band.<br /><br />That, Shame On The Moon, which featured Glenn Frey on harmony vocals, had already soared to # 1 Adult Contemporary (AC), # 2 Pop Hot 100 and # 15 Country in late December 1982/January 1983 on Capitol 5187 b/w House Behind A House. The only thing keeping it from # 1 Hot 100 was the combination of Baby, Come To Me by Patti Austin & James Ingram and Billie Jean by Michael Jackson which spent a combined nine weeks at the top spot.

B000UU4NE4|5.0|Raimi has done a solid job in directing and has made the movie look technically polished, especially given the capabilities of the time, but it is still one hot mess of a story with too many villains crammed in to this to make it \\"bigger and better\\", but it doesn't need it and all of the story lines suffer as a consequence.  On the plus side, the kids really enjoy it and for an adult, it is mostly watchable and passes the time.  My gripe is that Peter Parker does nothing to disguise his voice and close friends never seem to think Spiderman sounds familiar.  Easily fixed with a \\"voice modulator\\" (whether they exist or not) sewn into the spidey suit's neck.  Small things like that bug me, especially when they are so easy to work around.  Batman does it by speaking in a heavy whisper.<br /><br />Raimi and the writers have had to depart from the comic book basis of the story line to get three villains into the movie at once, plus the social problems Peter Parker has to face.  To their credit, they have tried to make the motivations of the villains believable rather than evil for evil's sake, which has been the trend in comic books.  Many of the major superheroes and their super-villains are being \\"re-booted\\" to give credibility to their motivations.  Christopher Nolan's Batman is a great example of this.
1451627297|5.0|Before I read 11/22/63, I had not read a Stephen King book in eight years.  I overdosed on King in high school and I grew tired of him.  But 11/22/63 was the PERFECT book to reacquaint myself with this masterful author.  King's new science fiction book is gripping from page one and has an ending that will leave you on the edge of your seat (and emotionally moved).<br /><br />11/22/63 follows English teacher Jake Epping on a time travel adventure to prevent the JFK assassination.  Epping is something of a loner, as his wife left him for another man.  One night, Jake is called by his friend Al Templeton, a local diner owner, to come to the diner after closing time.  When Jake arrives, he is shocked to discover that Al has seemingly aged several years overnight and he appears to be close to death.  The explanation is beyond Jake's comprehension.  For Al had discovered a time warp in his store room, nicknamed \\"the rabbit hole,\\" and had spent four years in the past.  The rabbit hole always transports you to September 9, 1958, 11:58 a.m.  When you come back through the portal, it is always two minutes after you left.  Al decided to try and do some good with this incredible find by preventing the JFK assassination, but his noble mission was interrupted when he was struck with lung cancer in the year 1962.  Al decides that Jake is the best candidate to complete this mission, and Jake reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />Thus Jake embarks on a five year odyssey to change the future for the better.  First, Jake decides to prevent the murder of the family of his friend Harry Dunning in the town of Derry, Maine, in 1958. But he soon discovers that the past does not want to be changed.  Jake encounters extraordinary bad luck whenever he attempts to change a significant event... bad luck that almost leads to his death multiple times.  This leads to one of the few firm time travel rules in the book:  the past will do anything it can to prevent any significant alterations, even if it means killing the time traveler.  King was wise to keep the time travel rules very simple, as this enables him to avoid the common pitfalls of time travel stories:  contradictions and plot holes.  To complicate matters even further, when Jake moves to Texas, he falls in love with a librarian named Sadie, which makes it more difficult to fulfill his mission and keep his secret.<br /><br />This book is different from many of King's works, and I mean that in a good way.  King has obviously done a lot or research into the life of Lee Harvey Oswald, and he recreates the past as realistically as Back to the Future.  But it's really the love story that forms the heart and soul of the book.  For a book about preventing the JFK assassination, it is surprisingly character driven, as Jake Epping essentially rediscovers himself in the past.  11/22/63 is less about an alternate history of what the world would be like if JFK survived and more about what one man is capable of achieving, and what the top priorities in life should be.  Some people may be disappointed by this, especially history buffs and JFK assassination conspiracy theorists, but I believe this is the book's strength.  I believe if King had indulged too much in alternate history, he would have taken the risk of becoming too political, and that is not where King excels most.  Plus, we'd all be arguing over the plausibility of his alternate history, which would sharply divide readers.  By writing a story about how time travel effects Jake Epping's life, King has written a more relatable tale.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that it slows down considerably when Jake Epping stalks Lee Harvey Oswald.  The research into Oswald's life is impressive, but these passages really labor on.  King is at the top of his game when he is not dealing with Oswald in my opinion.<br /><br />Obviously, I highly recommend this book to King fans, sci-fi fans, and history buffs alike (just don't expect it to be about JFK).  It is one of the best time travel stories I have ever read.  I breezed through it in four days.  I am very happy this book reignited my love for King books and I plan to read a lot more in the future.<br /><br />PS King fans will love the references to his classic book It!ne of the best time travel stories I have ever read.

B000O19EWK|5.0|I liked this movie when it first came out in theaters and my kids love it now.  Raimi has done an excellent job and clearly is/was comic book reader/fan and has done a very good job and stayed mostly faithful to the Spiderman comic book readers know and love.  My only quibble, and this applies to the superhero movie genre as a whole (not necessarily this particular movie), is that the movie gives varying levels of ability or strength to fit the story line.  It gives a weird disconnect to have Spiderman struggles with something that should be well within his capability in some situations but is able to perform extraordinary feats easily in others. His webbing is stronger than steel sometimes and easily broken or cut other times.  Spidey should be able to lift up a bus but struggles to hold on to a car.  Stuff like that.  I realize that the strength could become a sort of deus ex machina, but that just means the story needs to be better thought out.

0439023491|3.0|I greatly enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games\\", and looked forward to reading \\"Catching Fire\\".  While I don't think this second book is as good as the first, I still enjoyed it and recommend it.  Briefly, it advances the story of the fledgeling rebellion in the districts against the Capitol, and the reader gets to find out what happened to Katniss and Peeta after their triumph at their first Hunger Games.  My complaint with the second book, however, is that the entire second half of the novel sees Peeta and Katniss return to the arena for the Quarter Quell, making the entire latter part of the book very repetitious from the first book.  I will definitely read the third installment, though, and overall the second book is pretty good--I just wish it had introduced some more, new, non-recycled material.

However, you do get a lot of great pieces and the joy of LEGO is you can configure them in any way you want. I would highly recommend this set IF you can find it for around the suggested retail price.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Reviews on this novel seem to fall into two categories.  For the most part, people loved the book: the plot, the characters, the writing style, everything. On the other hand, I've read some reviews that stated that the book was terrific...until the end. Then for some reason it was trash.<br /><br />In my opinion, the truth falls somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />We've become accustomed to endings that are happy and tidy, especially in the mystery/thriller genre. To be honest, I prefer those types of endings. (Real life is hard enough. Why should pretend life also end poorly?) As many have already noted THIS IS NOT THAT TYPE OF NOVEL. I will say this, although the ending is not the tidy wrap-up some might prefer, it is the logical conclusion to universe created by Flynn. Some authors make unreasonable plot twists in order to achieve the 'happy ending.' Others will end with tragedy or catastrophe just for effect, to 'go against the genre'. \\"Gone Girl\\" does neither of these. Nobody gets what they deserve, but it is the most likely end-scenario in a fight with a sociopath (or two!)<br />The dual-narrator and present/past timeline format adds tension and psychological suspense to a slow-developing first act. The second act starts with a shocking revelation, and those familiar with Agatha Christie's \\"Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" will recognize a plot device which makes both narrators untrustworthy. This revelation is arguably the biggest twist in the entire novel. Also in the second act is a parade of increasingly sleazy, sordid,and manipulative characters. Thankfully, the book never sinks completely into the sewer, and the third act is a disturbing yet entertaining study of what desperate, unstable people do to extricate themselves out of nasty positions.<br /><br />The writing is always sharp, often vulgar, and at times darkly hilarious. You won't like any of the characters, and you aren't meant to. If you are the type that believes the ending makes or defines a novel, you will either love this novel or hate it intensely. If you are more concerned with the journey than the destination, you'll enjoy it just fine.

B002VHI8J0|5.0|A wise man would say people only commit murder for three reasons: Self-Protection, Love and Power.<br /> I'll say these are the same forces that drive Cloud Atlas. Above them, Power, or the Domination of the weak by the stronger. This is the theme David Mitchell wants to discuss with us and, in my opinion, it's around the struggle of power and freedom, that Cloud Atlas is built.<br /><br /> As simple as someone that tells a story to expose an idea, David Mitchell invites us to six different stories of six different heroes, times and locations, that are written as well in six different voices to suit each one of them.<br /> There are several connections between each story, ones more subtle them others, but the big link is found in the ideas David Mitchell want to discuss with us.<br /><br /> I say \\"discuss with us\\" because Claud Atlas it's a really open book, driven by very complex characters, and you'll be given the opportunity to \\"see\\" and take your own conclusions.<br /><br />In the end Cloud Atlas it's an extraordinary work, entertaining (some of its stories are superb thrillers), but written knowing that are better ways to deal with a reader than just entertain him: Charm. Fascinate. Inspire.

0446547603|5.0|Here is another page-turner from Nicholas Sparks. As always, he will spark your interest and imagination, and - as usual- he adds the unexpected twists and turns which will leave you saying....what? Really? Wow!<br />This fictional story takes place in a real town, Southport in NC. This town is known for the annual Fourth of July parade, its southern hospitality and beautiful beaches. As many of Sparks' novels, this one too will come to the silver screen on February 18, 2013. Much of the movie was actually filmed in this wonderful town which will never be the same, once the movie buffs will be exposed to it. If it is not yet on your 'bucket list', put it there now. The book, the movie and your next vacation.

B008I3QZKU|5.0|One play through of the album and I'm already completely hooked. This is why I love The Killers. Each album is so different from all the others, but each still distinctly Killers-ey. A lot of people are going to give this album 2 or 3 stars and cry that \\"this isn't like the old stuff\\". I'm going to tell you now that this is what happens every damn time The Killers release an album. When Sam's Town came out, people complained it didn't sound like Hot Fuss. When Day & Age came out, people complained it wasn't like Sam's Town or Hot Fuss. At the end of the day though, all 3 albums were amazing in their own way and Battle Born is no different.<br /><br />But enough with my mini rant, just buy this album and support The Killers god damnit XD<br /><br />Personal Favorites from the album:<br />Matter of Time<br />Battle Born<br />Flesh and Bone<br />Runaways<br />Miss Atomic Bomb

B0088TG252|4.0|While a timely topic is explored within a fictional window that allows the adult viewer to escape from the current, real world tragedies, one has to, as always, understand that the perfection of \\"Hollywood\\" and certain bias will have to be filtered out in one's mind to thoroughly enjoy Denzel Washington's and Ryan Reynolds' portrayal of Tobin Frost and Matt Weston.  The intrigue, plot variables and cinematography are all top drawer and the sub-plots, with their twists and turns keep the viewer on point with fast paced action and perhaps, while not subtle, make the film entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />I viewed the film via Amazon's Instant Video for a sale price and feel that I received much value for my payment.  I find Denzel Washington a very good actor and his dark portrayal in 'Safe House' was very well done.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I have often thought with much in life that \\"you get what you pay for\\" and wasn't too worried if this book turned out to be a dud.  Instead, I could not put it down, reading it while at work and falling asleep with it for several nights.  It is an incredible story that is historic, autobiographical, mysterious and an amazing all-around fantastic tale.  That the book contains the making of a movie as part of the plot leads me to believe that if a screenplay is ever created for this book, it will result in a block buster film.  Read it if you're a romantic, love history or are just looking for something that will leave you wanting more.  I loved it and highly recommend it.
B006ISJQ1W|2.0|as is the case in most print-to-film productions, this was not really true to the book. i was disappointed that the movie cut the entire begining of the book out. you get a little glimpse into events that may have lead to Hunter's eccentric behavior and the random flailing of his limbs. towards the end, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) displays a little of the Hunter S. Thompson-esque behavior that so many enjoyed in Fear and Loathing. it is mildly entertaining at best. Amber Heard is ridiculously hot. she certainly made this movie easier to watch.

B008PE9GSA|3.0|What's tough for me about reviewing a new ZZ Top record is comparing it to the classic sound of their 70's records.  I'm talking Rio Grande Mud, Tres Hombres, etc... but don't get me wrong.  I totally respect ZZ Top, and other classic rock era artists for heading in new musical directions.  As musicians, it would be stifling, I think, to continue producing the same sound over and over.  Most good musicians ( ZZ Top being in that category) are constantly influenced by an eclectic array of music. For instance: Billy Gibbons playing is certainly rooted in Blues Rock; but those roots certainly haven't kept him from exploring new territory.  All of this garners my utmost respect, but there are some mixed feelings on behalf of long time fans.  One thing that doesn't help, is the press that's preceded several ZZ Top releases over the years.  I can't count the number of times i've heard the following: &#34;If you like &#34;Tres Hombres&#34;, you are really going to like their upcoming release&#34;.  The truth is: ZZ Top hasn't released anything that sounds like their 70's stuff since, &#34;well&#34;, the 70's.  I'm sure the advance press is designed to pump up record buyers, but if it's not true, why shortchange the fans ?  They have certainly marketed &#34;La Futura&#34; as a nod to the past; and while there may be a hint of it here & there, it's buried in guitar sounds not reminiscent of those days.  If Billy Gibbons enjoys charting new territory in sound & technique, I say go for it. Who am I to tell Billy Gibbons ( a protege of Jimi Hendrix) what to do; but I know the fans would enjoy a return to form.  So, here's the skinny: I like the new record. It's the best they've done in a while. Much of the stuff they've released since &#34;Recycler&#34; has been disappointing, though I did enjoy &#34;Rhythmeen&#34;.  &#34;La Futura&#34; gets them back on course a bit. The record contains pleasurable echos from the past, though I wouldn't exactly call it a return to form. You can purchase a special edition album version which includes 2 bonus tracks that won't be on the regular release.  What's strange about the bonus tracks is that both (in my opinion) are more reminiscent what a 70's ZZ Top fan might appreciate. Go figure?  A better move might have been placing those tracks on the regular release.  At least that way, fans who read press comparisons to &#34;Tres Hombres&#34; wouldn't have been disappointed.  Jeff Leek
B00004S35Z|5.0|Mr. Wonder produced and played all instruments on this album.  Minnie Ripperton sings harmony. Sergio Mendez translates part of a song into Portuguese.  All songs stand on their own and together form a perfect symphony.  I can listen to this album over and over again and never tire of the beauty within. And each time I hear the songs I hear yet another note played or drum beat...simply amazing work! If you're having a not-so-great day this album can pull you through the rough water and have you sailing on a smooth sea in no time at all! This is a cerebral and ethereal sound with rich vocals and lyrics.  You will recognize the two hits that made the radio but the other gems on the album are just that...gems! Enjoy some Stevie!!!!
B000001ESF|5.0|I was 15 or 16 when someone gave me a bunch of 70's rock LPs, among them 2112.  It was absolutely toasted and had been played within an inch of its life.  It didn't matter.  This album was my introduction to Rush and, while there are albums of theirs I now like better, I think this one represents what Rush means to most people and has got to be one of the most beloved concept albums (or concept sides) in rock.  I still miss the crackle & pop of that trashed LP sometimes when I listen to the CD.  Good times. :)

B008J34466|4.0|Pink is back to what she does best; catchy tunes, shouty choruses, and wry/cynical lyrics. There isn't a duff track here and this is definitely her best album since \\"M!ssundaztood\\". Beware though, she swears quite a bit.<br /><br />Opening are the punchy pair of \\"Are We All We Are\\" and \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\", followed by the gently chugging ballad \\"Try\\" which is simply beautiful.<br /><br />The ballad \\"Just Give Me A Reason\\" is a rare (on her albums) duet with Nate Ruess from Fun., they sound so great together, it makes you want more which you get with the slightly Ska love/hate \\"True Love\\" with Lily Rose Cooper (formerly Lily Allen). Marriage and motherhood don't appear to have softened her by much.  \\"Here Comes The Weekend\\" is a stomping number featuring a rap by Eminem.<br /><br />\\"How Come You're Not Here\\" is a buzzing glam rocker with galloping beats and throaty vocals, while \\"Slut Like You\\" is a stomping Dance/Rock number. \\"The Truth About Love\\" is a retro rocker with lyrics touching on everything from poetry to trees and birds to body odour. \\"Beam Me Up\\" is a tender guitar/string ballad with heartfelt vocals on which she declares she's \\"tired of being a fighter\\".<br /><br />\\"Walk Of Shame\\" is a catchy hand clap-driven rocker. \\"Where Did The Beat Go\\" is an oddball piece (in a very good way) with clever word play, while closing is \\"The Great Escape\\", a tender piano/string ballad with an almost gospel fervour. \\"I wrote the book on running, but that chapter in my life, will soon be done oh, I'm the kind of the great escape, you're not gonna watch me checking out of this place\\" she sings.<br /><br />Now this is the real fun house.

B008I3QZKU|4.0|The Killers return on album number 4 with more widescreen rock, with lyrics about broken hearts and broken dreams.<br /><br />The anthemic \\"Flesh And Bone\\" opens the album, lead single \\"Runaways\\" is galloping Bruce Springsteen rock reminiscent of \\"When You Were Young\\", while slowing things down is the chugging \\"The Way It Was\\".<br /><br />\\"A Matter Of Time\\" recalls \\"Somebody Told Me\\" a wee bit, while \\"Deadlines And Commitments\\" is haunting and beautiful, reminiscent of \\"Tango In The Night\\"-era Fleetwood Mac, a highlight. \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" is U2 meets Springsteen, \\"The Rising Tide\\" surges like a wave, while \\"Heart Of A Girl\\" is a tender ballad.<br /><br />\\"Be Still\\" is a spectacular hymnal ballad with shimmery sounding harmonies, another highlight. closing is the epic title track \\"Battle Born\\", a triumphant piece with shades of Queen that could soundtrack a gladiator battle.<br /><br />A killer.

B0000CABBW|5.0|This movie starts off with a woman in labor with twins. Unfortunately the male twin and mother do not survive.  We learn that this story is taking place in a Maori village in New Zealand. The father (Porourangi) is left with Pai (the female twin) and a very disappointed father. Koro is Pai's grandfather that along with her grandmother takes care of Pai while Porourangi goes away after realizing that he cannot make his father happy now that he did not have a son. Koro is in need of a grandson to take on the leadership he holds as the chief.  Pai is now 11 years old and is trying very hard to empress her grandfather and make him believe that she is the leader he has been searching for all along. Koro starts a school for boys to find the new leader. Pai is secretly learning fighting and other skills that are needed to be the chief. Koro simply cannot see that women could ever be a leader because he cannot see past his indigenous ways. When all the boys fall short of the tasks Koro introduces them to, Pai ask for help from their gods. Several whales wash themselves ashore and Koro and the village try to get them back out to shore. After Koro tells Pai that she has done enough damage by her bad karma, she gets on the biggest whale and guides him back into the ocean. Everyone watches her as she rides the whale out and then down. The whale went down for a long time and everyone knows that Pai is not okay. When she is recovering in the hospital is when Koro realizes that Pai is the natural born leader that she has been trying to prove to him. This movie shows that just because something has been for thousands of years don't mean that is how it is meant to be forever.
B009329Y30|1.0|If you want to be sad and depressed, watch this movie. OMG. It is going to take me the entire day to cheer myself up after watching this very long sad sad sad movie. Even the so called happy ending was intensely sad. I hope you are on some seriously good antidepressants, because if not, this movie may cause a problem for you. Good lord!

B008578JI0|3.0|Story about a rag tag African American bomber Air Force protection team during WWII.  They were \\"outliers\\" who won respect and worked hard to prove others that they could live up to the task.  However, half way though the movie, it starts to get a bit muddled and cheesy in terms of plot line.  All in all, not a bad movie, but not that great either.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|A book review: No Easy Day by Mark Owen<br /><br />The account of SEAL life in the nonfiction novel \\"No Easy Day\\" will be familiar to those who have served in combat units; lots of training, too much red tape, too much hurrying-up, and of course too much waiting. One can plainly see the writing style of the novel was influenced by \\"The Tongue and Quill\\" or whatever it is the Navy calls their military writing style guide.  The novelized narrative is pretty straightforward and an easy read, climaxing with a firsthand account of SEAL Team 6's mission that killed Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Concerns about classified information in the author's account of SEAL life and specifically about the mission to capture or kill Osama bin Laden is, at least in my opinion, much ado about nothing.  I will admit there are some possible OPSEC issues, but plans and procedures are always evolving, not actually classified, and have a short shelf life in any case.<br /><br />Others were concerned with the author's depiction of barracks chatter about the president. I did not think the comments were too far out-of-line, not that I agreed with them, and I imagine they will not shock anyone who has actually served in the military. But this minor grumbling in the ranks was new to ears not familiar with such critical remarks. I have listened to similar complaints about all of the presidents I served under, from Carter to W.  Yes, even Uncle Ronny was not liked by everyone in the unit; but we kept it behind closed doors, it usually involved a beer or six, and just like those SEALs, we showed professionalism and always carried on the mission.<br /><br />Finally, the author took great pains in the \\"Author's Note\\" and the \\"Epilogue\\" to explain that the reason he wrote his story was to get the \\"real story\\" out there. If this was his true concern, I think his defense for writing the book was wasted.  Although I did not know all the detail provided in No Easy Day, the final press reports gave a fairlyaccurate account of the mission highlights---but you must understand that I am speaking about the final account that took some weeks to come out.<br /><br />Those concerns aside, I must say I enjoyed this story, revisiting the rude camaraderie of combat arms, and getting my boots full of sand one more time, without actually having to deploy or eat MREs.<br /><br />LBH IV
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of those rare movies that lives up to the book which precedes it. I would hope that movies of the following books will be made and that they maintain the same quality.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One has received rave reviews and I knew that I had to read it.<br /><br />This book by Ernest Cline focuses on Wade, a geeky adolescent, whose greatest ambition is to win a video game contest sponsored by an eccentric video game designer. There is an Easter egg hidden somewhere in OASIS, the virtual world created by this genius, and Wade, a poor nerd who has been orphaned, seems like the most unlikely candidate.  But to the world's surprise, he finds the first Key out of three, and starts the adventure of his life.<br /><br />This book is an incredible homage to the eighties pop culture, icons, music, and fads. I almost feel like to truly appreciate how awesome this book is one needs to have grown up during this time period. This book truly is a playground for those adults who love to read young adult books-- here we get that feel but at the same time, it has such a nostalgic feel. And what geekdom! For any adult who grew up as a nerd loving Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly ( OK so that's a more recent obsession), Lord of the Rings, etc, this book is for you. Because I meet all of his criteria to a tee, it's not a surprise that I loved this book.<br /><br />But past all of that, it is an exciting adventure all on its own with more than a few delightful twists. The world building is fantastic and I grew jealous of the characters as they get to participate in what has to be the coolest virtual video game ever. Plus, the characters are three dimensional and fun. Sam is a great protagonist, Aech is a hilarious sidekick, and Art3mis is a winning love interest--and quite a kick butt girl!<br /><br />My one criticism is mild. The villain was pretty two dimensional, but the rest of the book more than made up for it. Insignia, another recent book very similar to this one, is a pale shadow in comparison.<br /><br />Overall, highly entertaining and imaginative, with terrific references to the eighties and geekdom that are spot on and well researched. A must read for everyone, but in particular those still young and geeky at heart.everyone, but in particular those still young and geeky at heart.

B0089ZEEYG|1.0|I very rarely write reviews unless there's something particularly remarkable about the product or service in question, whether it is good or bad; however, I felt compelled to say something here, even though I've not played, or even heard of, today's FAOTD. At the time of this writing, there are 11 reviews, 9 of which are 5*, and after reading them, it seems pretty obvious that the majority of these are fake. If I'm wrong, I guess I owe a few apologies, but judging simply by the common wording and syntax, the majority (@ 7 out of 9) seem to be generically written by the same marketing \\"professional.\\" Is it just me, or do these reviews seem a little suspicious to anyone else?<br />BTW, again, I haven't tried or heard anything about this app, but I'm going with 1* based solely on the premise that, if it is any good, the devs wouldn't feel the need to publish fake reviews.

0525952926|5.0|Bestselling author of On Wings Of Eagles, Ken Follett delivers a sweeping and fascinating tale, which follows \\"Fall Of The Giants.\\" The author portrays the drama and events from the rise of the Third Reich through the Spanish Civil War, including the explosions of the American and Soviet bombs. In addition, Follett describes the heartbreak and courage that Carla had to endure, and how the experience of the unique characters marked history in that era. The compelling story also describes heroism and honor of World War II, social and political economic turmoil, and the intense dramas of World War II, weaving the different families. This is a breathtaking story that entertains and educates at the same time as the author writes with passion. An enjoyable epic that grabs the reader's attention in the very beginning with suspense throughout. Emotional and powerfully moving with explosive action. Highly recommended for historical lovers!
B005LAII62|5.0|I really wish there were more than 5 starts to give to this film because it deserves all the stars.<br /><br />Seriously, Paranorman was a great film. I don't know where to start. First, there story was great, not cliche at all.  Yes, it had your archetypal character types like the \\"cheer leader\\", the \\"jock\\" and the \\"bully\\"; but it took those archetypes and gave them a beautiful and witty twist.<br />This is not only a story about a kid who can see ghosts, it is so much more. It's a story about a kid who is bullied for being different, who doesn't quite fit in. But he's not a depressed about it, he doesn't act like a victim or wallow in self-pity. He moves on and even becomes something greater saving everyone.<br /><br />This movie teaches us that it's wrong to pick on others for being different and the extent of the pain and suffering that we can cause by being close minded and scared. I makes me incredibly sad to come across people who bad-mouth this movie for the extent of its open mindedness.<br /><br />Many people can relate to the themes mentioned in this movie. Children and adults alike.<br />I think its a great film, a master piece somewhat ahead of it's time and I am glad and grateful this movie was made.<br />To the directors and all the staff at Laika studios,<br />Thank you.
B002VKB0M4|2.0|The film is disappointing to me  for two reasons. One I was looking for a film that really concentrated on the physical allure of Paris and was disappointed in that it that did not give enough views or shots of the capital. The film hardly merited its title.  I think it could have done a better job of integrating the \\" feel of Paris\\"  into the life of the characters. This might not be important to some but I think it is a major flaw. Two the stories were rather disparate and boring. Good acting nonetheless by Juliette Binoche.

B007URVZJ6|3.0|The booklet has some useful information and since it's free I guess it's hard to complain. My only lament is that it's not exactly specific enough for me.<br /><br />For instance; The suggestion that the cover image be at least 1000 pixels on the long side with a ratio of 1.6 so 1000 x 1600. It would be nice to understand the PPI (pixels per inch) suggestion 72-ppi?<br />96-ppi? (My cover turns out at 688 pixels on the long side so I have to start over now.)<br /><br />It's probably my lack of knowledge that is the issue but now I'm left with the TOO technical-AmazonKindlePublishingGuidlines.<br /><br />What's a developing writer to do but get back to the books?<br /><br />Overall I think Building-Your-Book-For-Kindle is helpful and certainly a good value at the price.

B000J670ZI|3.0|I wanted to watch this after listening to the commentary for \\"What's Up Doc?\\" Barbra Streisand and director Peter Bogdonavich claimed that the mad-cap mix-ups in Bringing up Baby inspired the twists and turns in What's Up Doc except the thing that drove BUB forward were the mistaken identities of the Jaguar vs the suitcases in WUD. That is where the similarities end. BUB was shot in studio and WUD used the city of San Francisco as its backdrop.
B0063IH60K|4.0|excellent game. but between new game ads pop up so be careful. that's why it is free. I have this game on all of devices: iPad kindle win 8 laptop.
B00009W0U4|1.0|I could not get past the first 30 minutes of this movie. I kept waiting for the camera to level off and stop spinning but it never did. This is not my idea of a movie. Don't waste your time on this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|absolutely awesome. works perfectly. just what I needed for daily calculations and expenses. a great app to download. great job
B008XG1X18|4.0|This application is generally pretty good.  Sometimes it doesn't load properly on my Kindle.  But otherwise it is worth downloading.
B0075LTOR2|5.0|i must absolutely agree with the positive reviews.  packaging is lush, and the sound is a revelation.  others have elaborated at length, so there is no need for my doing so.  leave it to say, if you are a roxy music fan, this set is a perfect purchase.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like how the games vary both in style and in hardness.  good way to kill time. overall pretty good.

B0086AYAQ6|5.0|This DVD will appeal to anybody who can appreciate piano music. Valentina is a highly talented pianist who not only plays her music, she lives and feels it while she plays it. It is a true pleasure and honor watching her perform some of the greatest music ever written. Her style and flawless technique and beautiful interpretation are breathtaking and captivating. She has an incredibly bright future ahead of her!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No national secrets revealed.  A great account of true heroes and how they dealt with one of the most important missions in history.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Big relief that I can get it from here since they removed it from the Play Store. Don't see any porn ads i that other people are reporting though.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Several very catchy songs for my 6 year old girls.  Their #1 favorite is Break Down the Walls.<br />Other favorites are Na Na Na, Double Take, Heard it on the Radio, Not a Love Song.<br /><br />I like this music, too.  My kids were learning songs from bigger kids at school like \\"I'm sexy and I know it\\", which is totally inappropriate for 6 year olds, so I am glad they are now into these songs that are more sanitized -- songs about summer vacation, etc.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I liked the story but thought Cory was too much of a jock; he is a good detective though and his reasoning skills are spot on. I would have liked to known more about him beforehand. I doubt I'll buy another book by DeMille.
0312430000|5.0|\\"The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right\\" by Atul Gawande is a very important addition to the literature about improving the execution of just about anything.<br /><br />Gawande was asked to lead a panel of World Health officials in coming up with ways to improve the outcomes of surgical procedures world-wide in a daunting variety of Health Facilities, from rural health clinics in India to historic hospitals in England. There was a lot of discussion about the many improvements that could be pushed out to the health community, but they decided to borrow from the world of aviation where the use of checklists has a long history of effectiveness.<br /><br />Gawande shows that there have been remarkable improvements in safety and positive outcomes when Checklists are instituted in hospital trials around the world. In this book he also learns from Aviation experts how to get checklists right.<br /><br />Checklists are helpful for a number of reasons<br /><br />  Humans are notorious for assuming that they can keep everything in their heads. This is tied to the main tenant of the Getting Things Done approach to personal effectiveness. It takes a lot of mental resources to keep more than a few items in our heads, as a result, we have added stress and we miss things. A checklist is a great way to save the tasks so that we do not have to. I found this was the case when I as a youth worked at Burger King. I can proudly say that I was exceeding fast on the Whopper Board (where we made the single patty burgers). However when I came back to work there part-time after a spending two years in Chile, I could not perform as well. Before Chile, I would mark the special orders on the burger packages, immediately as they were called over the PA system and we were swift as lightning, however two years later, after Chile I would for some reason try to keep it in my head, and would invariable miss orders.<br />  Checklists allow the whole team to focus on a small number of important behaviors. They found that something as simple as including an bullet to have the team tell each other their name and their responsibility within the operating room, yielded a great deal of benefit of improved communication during the procedure. Team members were more likely to voice concerns and mistakes were avoided.<br />  Checklists bring consistency to the world of Mavericks and Heroes. Many people bristle at the thought of having rules and procedures take the life or creativity out jobs, however, when we leave it to chance and impromptu action, then we leave room for mistakes and inefficiency. It reminds me of the case of the piano tuner who decided to do everything slowly and properly, he found that he actually completed his tasks faster than when he cut corners and rushed. Check lists allow us to carefully do things the right way.<br /><br />I like how this fits into the Getting Things Done approach where we capture a list of next actions within our computer, or notebook or whatever. Even making a list of things to be packed for camping is such a time saver. Like going over a checklist before a regular planning meeting to see that we are discuss all the right stuff. We use our brain power in one concerted effort to make a good checklist, and then we can spend our mental energy on more creative efforts, and to improve the checklist.<br /><br />I can see application of these principles in many places, such as in a family with a \\"Saturday Night Checklist\\" with (find church shoes; make sure church clothes are laid out; etc.)<br /><br />The topic sounds boring, but Gawande has good stories that apply to the application of these principles. He also wrote \\"Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance\\" which is also fascinating reading about improvements in medical care.nt behaviors.

0142407380|5.0|Teen spy Alex Rider is recovering from a gunshot wound in a private hospital when thugs burst in meaning to kidnap the boy in the next room. Wanting to protect the son of wealthy Nikolai Drevin, Alex takes his place. The bad guys, who don't know one kid from another, forcibly take Alex to a deserted warehouse. There they await a response to their ransom demands. But Alex isn't one to sit idly by, especially when the thugs threaten to cut off one of his fingers and send it to Drevin as proof they have his son. To forestall the horrendous act, Alex reveals his true identity and learns that the gang belongs to the terrorist group, Force Three. He manages a harrowing escape after the terrorists lock him up and set fire to the deserted building.<br /><br />In gratitude to Alex for saving his son from a traumatic ordeal, Drevin invites Alex for a holiday on a private island in the Caribbean. Drevin's space station is set to become the first hotel in space. But is that all Drevin plans? Engaged by both MI6 and the CIA, Alex attempts to discover Drevin's secrets while pretending to be his son's friend and an honored guest. His visit quickly turns dangerous as the Force Three gang shows up and Alex becomes the hunted instead of the hunter.<br /><br />Another rousing episode in the Alex Rider series, this story is just as fast-paced and exciting as the rest. It's pure escapism at heart.
1400069289|5.0|From \\"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\\" by Charles Duhigg, we learn the science behind habits. Habits lead to lasting change. This book goes well with and overlaps just a little bit with \\"Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength\\".<br /><br />Duhigg shares that habits are comprised of three components<br /><br />The Cue is a trigger that tells our brain to go into automatic mode and that tells us which routine to follow. The Routine is the action that occurs and the Reward is the event which helps the brain figure out if this routine is worth remembering. As we go through this cycle, the routine gets reinforced within the basal ganglia in our brains.Soon our conscious mind can go deal with other matters and the routine gets played out without effort.<br /><br />As a habit gets developed both the cue and the reward create a craving in the brain. Businesses use these cravings to its advantage. Toothpaste adds mint related ingredients, because we associate the tingling feeling with clean teeth.<br /><br />A series of experiments was performed with Eugene, a man who (because of a viral infection that attacked his brain), could not remember anything more than a few minutes. Through repetition, he learned to pick the \\"correct\\" card when shown two cards. He could give no explanation of why he made the particular choice. In fact, he was not even aware that he had sat down choose between two cards many times before.<br /><br />After discussing individual habits and their formation. Duhigg talks about habits in the organization. In this, probably the best section of the book, we learn about how Paul O'Neill transformed Alcoa. When O'Neill was chosen as CEO of Alcoa, he knew that Alcoa had plenty of problems and he had to change the culture. Many were dismayed when he first met with Wall Street investors, and told them that the Plan was to make Safety the highest priority. Many were dumbstruck, when he responded to questions about financial strategies by reiterating the evacuation plan for the building, and pointing out the emergency exits.<br /><br />What O'Neill was doing by choosing Safety as his Mantra, was taking advantage of a Keystone Habit. A Keystone habit is one that positively affects other beneficial habits. By emphasizing Safety, O'Neill was doing several things. He was changing the way that management interacted with the laborers. He was making everyone focus on making the plants run more efficiently, because if they are efficient, they are less likely to cause injuries. If someone got hurt in an Alcoa plant, whole procedures kicked in to make sure that issues were resolved. This focus lead Alcoa to become very profitable, and successful. This Keystone habit played a critical role.<br /><br />Durhigg shares how Keystone habits can help individuals.<br /><br />  \\" When people start habitually exercising, even as infrequently as once a week, they start changing other, unrelated patterns in their lives, often unknowingly. Typically people who exercised start eating better and being more productive at work. They smoke less and show more patience with colleagues and family. They use credit cards less frequently and say they feel less stressed. It's not completely clear why. But for many people, exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change\\"<br /><br />I can vouch for the power of Keystone habits. For me, riding my bike to work is a keystone habit. When I do it, It causes me to try to eat healthier, to not drink sodas at work (even though they are free!) and I feel like I am more focused and productive.<br /><br />  \\"Studies have documented that families who habitually eat dinner together seem to raise children with better homework skills, higher grades, greater emotional control, and more confidence. making your bed every morning is correlated with better productivity, a greater sense of well-being, and stronger skills at sticking with a budget. It's not that a family meal or a tidy bed causes better grades or less frivolous spending. But somehow those initial shifts start chain reactions that help other good habits take hold.\\"<br /><br />There is a lot of other good info in The Power of Habit, which I strongly recommend, and I will write more about in a future blog post.<br /><br />In the Appendix, Duhigg provides a reader's guide where he suggests affecting change by  the following steps:<br /><br />  Identify the routine<br /><br />Maybe the routine is grabbing a sugary soda, or losing our temper when talking to a co-worker. We first need to identify the action that is the core of our habit. Particularly if it is one that we are trying to change. Experience has taught us that it is not easy to simply get rid of the action, but better to determine a substitute action. Maybe we need to substitute a few squeezes to a stress ball, instead of saying the words that we will regret.<br /><br />  Experiment with rewards<br /><br />We generally have habits, because they provide us with some reward. We need to see how our new routine provides us with a reward that is desirable enough to draw us to the new action. It might be the same reward associated with our old action. We should get creative here.<br /><br />  Isolate the cue<br /><br />What is the event that causes our habit to kick in? This can be tricky. Our environment is very noisy and distracting so we need to keep a good record or diary to discover recurring patterns.<br /><br />  Have a plan<br /><br />Once you understand your cue, routine and reward you can make a plan to remold your behavior. For example, let's say that you want to stop playing solitaire when you have deadlines to meet. You realize that you do it because you are tired of typing. It gives you a reward because it is satisfying to win the card game. A plan would be to recognize the Cue of getting tired, and planning at that point to stand up, stretch, and maybe care for the houseplants in the office. Since you like the natural touch, this is rewarding, and is healthier than playing solitaire.<br /><br />This book also would be good with \\"Change Anything: The New Science of Personal Success\\" by a host of authors.r a tidy bed causes better grades or less frivolous spending.

B007KCG7MQ|4.0|In August 2012 I saw Joe Walsh in concert in Victoria, B.C. during his tour to promote this album, his first new album in about 20 years. He put on a really good show although the venue (a small city park) sucked big time and the concert promoter couldn't have been more blatant in gouging the fans for money. (As one example, the security made me pour out the contents of my water bottle - pure unadulterated water, by the way - at the gate and told me I could buy more water at the bottled water stand inside the venue at $2 for a very small bottle.) And then there were the people wearing \\"Concert Volunteer\\" vests going through the audience selling $5 tickets for a 50/50 draw, ostensibly to support a local charity. As far as I'm aware, the 50/50 draw never happened; I certainly didn't hear any announcements from the stage about it and I stayed until the end of the show. I'm guessing someone just pocketed the cash.<br /><br />But one can't blame Joe Walsh for the blatant greed of a concert promoter.<br /><br />This a really good album with some very strong new material on it. One interesting point to note is that it's produced by Jeff Lynne, formerly of Electric Light Orchestra and the Travelling Wilburys. Joe Walsh and Jeff Lynne are an interesting combination which brings some different twists to Joe Walsh's music.<br /><br />Overall a very strong Joe Walsh album.

Period, the end.<br /><br />One of the best I have ever read.

B0053O89KG|1.0|Huge 'Castle' fan from the pilot until S3, when the show suddenly decided that everything that was great about it --- great character interactions, fun cases, witty banter, just plain ol' FUN --- needed to be jettisoned.  And the boring, boring, annoying, boring, stupid show that is Season 4 resulted.<br /><br />I ended up actually despising Beckett, disliking Esposito intensely, and wanting just to slap Gates.  And wth happened to Lainie?  Did zombies come and suck her brain out?  And Jenny is all of a sudden practically a 'ho?  What?  Castle and Ryan were the only 2 that bore any resemblence at all to the characters from the first 3 seasons.  Unfortunately, even N Fillion, as great as he is, could not salvage this season.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|Arrived in the mail quickly and as described. Waited for a Friday afternoon to give to nephew and never put it down until he had to go to school on Monday morning. Definitely better than being glued to the TV set or video game!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Its amazing how this documentary contains a huge amount of footage from the war!! also very interesting interviews.<br />It tells the complete story reviewing on each chapter the historical aspects of the war focusing on how the story unfolded.<br /><br />PLEASE DONT PAY ATTENTION TO BAD REVIEWS!! people that reviewed with 1 Star should place their comments on the blu-ray edition not on this DVD product as this gives the false idea to people reading the reviews! this documentary is trully a MUST have if you like history!<br /><br />I RECOMMEND IT!
1451626657|5.0|Joseph Heller's greatest book changed my life the first time I read it in 1999, which, alas, was the year of the author's death. I have been influenced so much by it that I often use the word \\"Catch-22\\" in conversations! Although many say that the book's dark humor and existential discussions of the absurdity and cruelty of war have been surpassed by other subsequent works by new writers, I still believe all the others merely stand on Joseph Heller's achievements. Anyone who wants to see what the fuss is about should read Catch-22 to see it for themselves.

This album has some solid gems, a handful of \\"Yup, I'm skipping this,\\" and those that are just okay.<br /><br />The good:<br />Next Year<br />Sun > probably my favorite track on the album<br />Sleep Alone<br />The World is Watching > what a nice surprise! I can see this becoming my favorite very soon<br /><br />The OK:<br />Handshake<br />Wake Up<br />Someday<br />Pyramid<br /><br />The not so good:<br />Settle<br />Spring<br />Beacon<br /><br />I'm not saying I won't change my mind in the future, but as of right now, this is how I feel.

034580404X|1.0|I must confess I made a mistake of ordering the trilogy. I was excited when the books arrived, I could hardly wait. I couldn't wait to see what the hype was about. I was greatly disappointed. I couldn't even finish the first book. I thought it was in poor taste, low class & at times, just disgusting!<br />Books are my passion, I LOVE to read, but this is one book I would not ever recommend.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This was a gift.  The person who received it just loved it.  Great detail due to the blue ray.  A must see for Batman fans.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I was looking for a book to read on my vacation, picking one from the Amazon best sellers list is a quick and easy process and usually results in a satisfactory read.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of hype around this book, but it was not until I had started reading it that I realized the type of book that I had chosen.<br /><br />I did not finish this book and will not read any of the others in the series.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this trilogy.  The story lines were excellent and kept one involved so that you did not want to put it down till the end.  The little twist in the third book was excellent.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The search for Ben Laden didn't occur until late in the book, however, the story leading up to it shows how hard our Seals train to eecute \\"perfect\\" assignments.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I was a bit let down by this series especially after all the hype in the media prior to me reading it.  The story line was good but there was too much harping on the sex scenes which were pretty tame in comparison to some others I have read previously.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It is a good story after you get through all of the kinky sex.  Christian has a lot of demons from his childhood and with the help from Ana he overcomes his dark side.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I'd heard this book mentioned many times but I'd never actually sat down to read it. While it is definitley not a literary classic it does a great job of keeping the readers attention.<br /><br />I found it to be throughly enjoyable and an easy read. The language and style of writing made it easy to believe that a Navy SEAL had actively helped in the writing process. Although at times it was easy to detect shifts in writing style. I don't know how much of that was fabricated and how much of that can be attributed to real life input from Marcus.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has improved tremendously.  I love Pinterest and how easy this is to use!  I could spend hours searching recipes, crafts, clothing and decorations!

B004EPYZPI|4.0|I have read all of Michael Connelly's books. The movie of The Lincoln Lawyer followed that books polt closer than Clint Eastwood's adaptation of Blood Work. I enjoyed both movies. I would like to see more of his characters on screen. Do you like crime novels. Try his first book \\"The Black Echo\\", it was written twenty years ago and is still a great read. If \\"Echo\\" tweaks your intrest for a first time author; as it did mine; hold on, you only have 25 books to go.
B005ERIRZE|3.0|I just grabbed the Kindle preview, and will post an actual review if I buy and read the book -- but choosing to try it was based on a strategy I've used with great success in the past:<br /><br />Read the WORST reviews first, starting from 1-* and working up. The more asinine, illiterate, bigoted, and/or irrelevant they are, the better the book is likely to be. For this title, all of the sub-3-* reviews met one or more of the \\"do the opposite of what this moron recommends\\" criteria, hence I'm giving it a look despite some reservations about self-help books in general and pop-psych in particular.<br /><br />The review that really nailed it for me was the one about \\"liberal bias\\" -- WTF? in a self-help book? What, does she advocate socialism or bash capitalistic greed? and if so, SO WHAT? It's a specious, ad hominem criticism of a book in this genre, and says more about the paranoia of the reviewer than about the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Possible spoilers!<br /><br />The story of Nick, Amy, and an incredible deception.  Nick and Amy get married and seem perfect for one another.  Even though each has hang ups from their youths, these really do not surface until their lifestyles take a change.  When their world becomes rocky, the problems start, and the personalities and characters they have made themselves and everyone else believe, are lost. Both Nick and Amy begin to show a side that they themselves don't even want to believe exists.<br /><br />I found the book to be readable and engrossing. After I completed the book, I continued to ponder Nick and Amy and how they tried to be what family and society wanted them to be.  That in itself wasn't so difficult when there were jobs and friends and the feeling of success; but, like many others, when times become rough and the test of character is made, failures result. It was intriguing to see both turn into coniving individuals, of course, one much more so than the other.<br /><br />The ending, which was what most of the single star reviews hated about the book, was not a fairy tale ending, but life is not always a fairy tale. One review stated it was more of a Hitchcock ending.  I agree and I am a long time fan of Hitchcock, so even though the book didn't necessarily end as I would have liked, I do respect the author's ability and \\"guts\\" to do something different.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I found Tasks N Todos Pro to be much better than the tasks app built into Android.  However, it has a few bugs and still has room for improvement.<br /><br />Some of the good things are it allows you to have several different lists of tasks, each task can have a due date and you can set reminders for the tasks.  Tasks are displayed nicely and makes it easy to organize.<br /><br />Some that could use some improving:<br />- When a reminder pops up it gives you the option to mark it as completed or to delete the task, however tapping any of those options never do anything.  You still have to open the app and then mark the task as completed.<br />- There's an option to allow for nested task lists.  Unfortunately this is a global setting that applies to all the task lists.  It would be nice if this could be applied to task lists individually, so that you can have one list that is nested, and another list that is sorted by due date.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Every song on this album makes you want to learn to play it. Can't seem to put it down, been listening to it over and over.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|For the first three seconds, it was okay. Then it was just bad. Maybe if you tilted to drive, it would be better, but with only one avatar and only one track, it barely manages to get 2 stars.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I'll never go back to iTunes. This app works perfect on my galaxy s2. I have used the Amazon mp3 service for years. It's nice to have it on my mobile devices. I was also able to get it on my girl's iphone. Perfect.
B0086700CM|5.0|The first time I played this game, I loved it! haven't stopped playing it since. every one I've asked about this game has loved it too. Imangi has got a hit with this one!
1933952806|5.0|Generally a person would be reluctant to order a book (as I was) other than the instruction manual that came with your purchase.  However this book \\"Mastering the Nikon D7000\\" is excellent for beginners or for pros.  The author really loves photograph and put some time in publishing this work of art.  I recommend this book to anyone who bought the Nikon D7000...a  great buy.  You won't be sorry.  It's easy to read and very detailed.
B004VUP8WK|2.0|Every band slips once in their career but Morbid Angels low point came much later. They experimented with industrial and nu-metal along with bad songwriting. Pete Sandoval left the band and he made the band, in my opinion. He's one of the most talented drummers and leaving the band take them a step down, he probably didn't want to waste his time by putting no effort into an album. Too Extreme is one of the worst song titles ever, especially for a death metal band. Their songs used to be some of the heaviest and most intense death metal, along with being very technical but now they're trying to follow modern metal. I actually like some nu-metal and metalcore but I wouldn't look in Morbid Angel's discography for that. Another thing that I dislike is that it sounds like David Vincent is impersonating Til Lindeman of Rammstein. I'd have to say that it was a disappointing release for taking 8 years. There's some good tracks but a lot of ones that are embarrassingly bad.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest but this app freezes up constantly,  shuts off,  or won't open at all. I am using my kindle fire.
0312641893|5.0|You know that feeling when you see a book's cover art and find it sooo appealing that you just had to know what it's about? Or sometimes, you just grab it off a bookstore's shelf and buy it without knowing what it's about? Well I didn't feel that way with Cinder. I wasn't completely sold on the cover; I'm not saying it's awful, I just don't find it extremely striking or attention grabbing. Then I read the title, and I tell myself, \\"Cinder? Hmmm... Looks like a retelling of Cinderella... with some sort of... robotic feature?!\\"<br /><br />I cringe at the idea. Is that even possible? That's a bold move, Marissa Meyer; but it doesn't seem convincing. So I let the book go and moved on to looking at other books.<br /><br />After some time, I came across several blogs that received copies of Cinder... so I decided to check the book's synopsis and I thought, \\"huh. Sounds interesting enough...\\"<br /><br />Still skeptical yet curious, I decided to give Cinder a shot and... BOY, DID IT BLOW ME AWAY!<br /><br />I curse myself for not getting this book sooner!<br /><br />Marissa Meyer's Cinder is like no other retelling of Cinderella. If you think you've read, seen or heard every possible remake or reiteration of this story, well get ready to be proven wrong. It's amazing what really creative authors can do, and I can strongly say that Marissa Meyer is an author to watch out for.<br /><br />The plot of this book is something I find unique and refreshing. It's not completely based on the classic but the important details or the commonly known facts of Cinderella [the stepmother and stepsisters; Cinder being forced to work by her stepmother; the whole prince and the ball event, not to mention the leaving behind the slipper thing] were of course, presented in this adaptation (if you're thinking of the Disney version, note that there's no fairy godmother here, sorry), and yet you'll be surprised with how those things will turn out. And did I mention this is set in a futuristic world? Pretty cool, huh? Wait `til you get to actually read about it `coz this author has one hell of an imagination!<br /><br />Now Cinder's character is rather interesting. Being a cyborg and having a built-in internet-like system within your vision is enough to keep me turning page after page, after page. Add the fact that she's the best mechanic in all of New Beijing considering she's a girl, bravo on that idea! Sadly, I feel like I didn't get to know Cinder that well. Her personality's still a bit vague to me. Maybe she'll grow as this series progresses so I'll be keeping an open mind about that.<br /><br />Are you waiting to find out about Cinder and the Prince (his name's Kai by the way)? Hmm... Let's just say there are few bittersweet moments to watch out for.  By few I mean waiting for the next book to come since the relationship is still in the process of development. Bummer!<br /><br />So I did mention that the fairy godmother has gone AWOL, but that doesn't mean we're short on villains too. Cinder is already taking in the wickedness of her stepmother and a particular stepsister when she also catches an evil queen's attention. Poor, Cinder... and to think the journey to a happily ever after ending has just begun.<br /><br />Did I just say: \\"begun\\"? Yes, you read that right, because you better be prepared for a major, and I mean MAJOR, cliffhanger. Seriously?! These authors are deliberately cruel! Why? Why must you torture your readers? *Wailing uncontrollably* LOL.<br /><br />Needless to say, I absolutely love this book. It's an enchanting book that successfully gives this classic story a new and invigorating twist that'll keep you wanting more.? Pretty cool, huh?

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is AWESOME, it holds your attention and it is so hard to put it down.  To us it seems he explains a lot, but I know he just touches on all they do.  He did not give away any secrets.  He exposed some lies, surprise surprise.  I would reccomend everyone should read the book.<br /><br />God Bless all you guys do for our country and us, we do appreciate you.
B006VRLNV6|5.0|Rest assured, this is not the 2007 remix that came out a few years ago.  This 40th anniversary edition is the original 1971 mix.  It's essentially no different than the 1999 remaster other than it has a second disc with some great bonus tracks with plenty of funny and clever Jim Morrison between-takes dialog.  One of the most hilarious bits is when they're about to record Take 1 of \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" and Jim tells the engineer the song is called \\"The Bastard Son Of Jimmy and Mama Reed\\".  Too bad they don't sell just the bonus disc by itself.  Otherwise, this is a very recommended purchase if you don't already have a copy.
B002O0KUXG|5.0|This is a great, premium switch for easily switching a usb port between two devices.  I use it to share an AT&T Momentum Aircard between two computers where it is not easy to get to the usb ports.  The box makes an audio sounds, but you can turn it off.  There is a slight delay when switching between two Windows 7 computers.  That is not the fault of the switch, but an issue with how Windows handles \\"hot\\" usb ports.  The delay is maybe 2-3 seconds - not really long at all - and I don't think that there is a way to fix it anyway.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i may not be some big book critic, but if you see a problem with this book then you must be reading something different. i am rarely moved by books,but this one stole my heart.
B000007MVD|4.0|This is a great list of popular songs from early in The Beatles career (e.g. \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\") as well as songs not available elsewhere (e.g. \\"Johnny B Goode\\").  Great clean live recordings.  They're not \\"bootleg\\" quality, but recorded directly from the board, and without the constant noise of cheering fans.  These are all Mono recordings.<br /><br />From the booklet: \\"Between March 1962 and June 1965, The Beatles were featured performers in 52 BBC radio programmes and sang 86 different songs - an amazing 36 never issued on disc.  Luckily for the world, the legacy from that time is this collection of aural snapshots of a group that had served its musical apprenticeship and was now irresistible and all-conquering.\\"<br /><br />For those who can't get enough of the Beatles, here's something more to enjoy.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|This edition has some errors in spelling and punctuation, but it was quite simple to read past without losing the original meaning of the sentences.<br /><br />These books have been an absolute joy to read, bringing alive the rich world of the 19th century and infusing it with suspense and drama and most important of all, a dedication to Reason.
B000AM6OQ2|1.0|My sister invited me over to watch this movie. I love scary movies and such so I was initially really happy to see this. The concept was a good one. The basic underlying plot was good. The story, however, was SOOOOOOO boring and drawn out. I mean, hardly anything even happened and the scenes of them freaking out in the water just felt idiotic and overacted.<br /><br />JUST when the movie started to get awesomely interesting...the credits began to roll! Yeah, the GOOD stuff happens at the absolute very end. Just when you get interested, you get cut off. It was a waste of my time and just boring all around. I can enjoy a good crappy movie like The Nun, or Tiki, or some other cheesy cult classic, but this was an extremely CRAPPY crappy movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should by minecraft. I got it this morning and I played it every free chance I go. So BUY!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is one of the best books that I have ever read. Looking forward to reading the last book in the series!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like this app....the only problem I &quot;sometime&quot; have is that the tape function doesn't always work properly.  Sometimes it takes several taps before the tape shows.  Other then that, I think this is a cool little app....maybe could have used a square root function.....I'm dealing with my eighth graders math homework - lol.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I don't always choose sports-related movies but when I do I like them to be character driven and well written.<br /><br />This is a great movie with fantastic acting. Also, Tom Hardy is incredibly sexy and even more built than the last time I saw him shirtless. Glory-be.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I highly recommend the first couple episodes for teachers of the American Revolution and early government.  Even my more disinterested students find them very good.  For other teachers, I have worksheets created for every episode (and their keys) so please reply to this post with your email if you would like them.  Enjoy this great work!
0451232577|5.0|Great book. Waiting for book two.  He's one of my favorite authors.  Very interesting as you really get a feel for life back then.
B007HJ96NO|5.0|I must admit, that this review is for the original release and not the director's cut.<br /><br />Glad I got that out of the way.<br /><br />This film is beautiful.  So beautiful and eloquently acted and filmed that subtitles are virtually unnecessary.  This is a movie for movie lovers.  And what a movie it is.  Sublime.<br /><br />I first saw this film at the Cabot Cinema in Beverly, MA and toward the end of the movie I was wondering why everyone was whispering.  Well, they weren't whispering.  They were crying.  I was among them.<br /><br />Morricone's score is unforgettable.  This is a film about human compassion, passion, dreams, and letting go.  To movie lovers everywhere: please Please PLEASE experience this movie.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read the book because I thought it was getting the same kind of buzz as the Three Shades of Gray Trilogy (which I felt was one book too long).  It didn't live  up to its hype.  Not as sexy as I thought it should be and kind of soft in the writing of the characters.  It was certainly not a book I'd recommend unless you want to keep up with the buzz.
0525953728|5.0|As an ex-military man I had qualms about buying and reading this book.  We were raised based upon the concept that real men didn't have to talk about their heroic actions.  But, with all the false media/political reports surrounding UBL's death, I felt the need to find out this man's \\"truth\\".  I do trust his account over that of the politically correct media and the chest thumping politicos.  Liberals will not like much of the content of this book, but then again most liberals have not served in the military and would not understand.  Or, at least that was the case when I served my country...who knows what it is like these days?  The book itself was well written and flowed to its inevitable conclusion.  I was hoping for more details about the actual UBL operation.  The author does cover it, but I think he left out a lot of detail that could have been included without compromising security.  The mission is in the last 3 or 4 chapters of the book, but I feel that the beginning of the book has to be read to understand the conclusion.  One thing that was not answered was why burial at sea, and why the general public has never had a chance to see the pictures?  But, there I go, trying to practice my quasi-CSI persona.  I recommend the book if you can overlook the \\"seal code\\" of silence.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story has a slight twist but mostly predictable. I finished the book but it did take me longer than it typically takes me to complete a book. It didn't hold my interest liked I has hoped.
B001GF8WPI|4.0|I enjoy watching this movie, several times in the past year.  It is always entertaining.  It features a very low-key performance by Will Ferrell.  If you are used to his over-the-top persona, you may be disappointed in this movie.  I feel that Dustin Hoffman turns in a very admirable performance as well.  I wish that they had cast someone besides Gyllenhaal, I have never cared for any of her performances, not that good as an actress.  And she is the reason I give the movie only four stars instead of five.
B004132HZS|5.0|i was a little unsure for the beginning but after i accepted there view of sherlock in this age i was engulfed in their world. i really love this and think any sherlock fan would apreciate this
B0036TGSRG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  The acting was very good, and I actually felt there was suspense as well.  Maybe I'm a little slow on the \\"who done it\\" part, but it kept me entertained for the entire length of the movie.  Just remember, it is a work of fiction and to try and make it anything else is simply silly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|sometimes slow to load back after linked to outside source, but overall, one of my top 5 face apps! fabulous!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I found it informative and I learned more about SEALS, the most written about \\"Secret Unit\\" in existence, than I knew before after reading all books about Seals that I could. I appreciate that it did not focus on the initial training Bud/S, since other books cover that topic thouroughly. I found myself wanting more meaning I want to ask the author questions. I want to know what the author's thoughts are about the members of Seal Team Six who were tragically killed in the helicopter not long after the killing of UBL.  I really wanted a little more about the politics and the feelings of the Seals toward the current occupant of the white house. I don't think I figured out if the author was married or had children, it seems most of the Seals did have families, but I understand that he did not want to provide identifying information.<br /><br />I respect and honor the service of the author and his fellow Seals, all heroes in my mind. I appreciate that he wrote his book, especially in light of the fact that this information will not be released by any other source (except for leaks that benefit politicians and put Seals in danger). I would hope that high school students would be exposed to more of this subject. I think our schools have been neglegent in teaching the concept that, \\"Freedom isn't free.\\"<br /><br />I want to repeat my expression of gratitude to the Seals and all members of our armed services who put it all on the line in service of their country.<br /><br />I recommended this book to my friends.<br />bj
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its awesome love the app! I only ever use it on my kindle cause I love ot that much soooo much fun :) Addicting
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I was so excited after watching the product demo and how stable videos you can achieve using it.<br /><br />The fact is that, you may never succeed to make it work... There is no instructions to follow in the box to make your camera stable on it, I found a single video in youtube by a user describing how to adjust it, the video was so clear, however I never succeeded to balance my heavy camera (still within the limits according to product load specifications).<br /><br />I wish I was able to return it, but being out of the US, it is not that easy to do that on time.<br /><br />I am giving it 2 stars, because the product quality itself is good and because it seems to be working with other customers.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I learned more about Lee Harvey Oswald than I ever did in school! Stephen King does a great job once again. It did seem to drag on at times, that is why I only gave it 4 stars.
B003N0XDT4|2.0|When I first got this, I plugged it in to charge for several hours and then hooked up to the USB on my phone (galaxy siii) and there was audio but also an irritating clicking sound. I tried with my laptop via usb and it persisted. After a couple resets and toggling usb charge a few times the clicking went away and I was presented with the best sound I've ever heard from a phone or pc. This lasted throughout the evening and was a blast listening to a wide range of music from classical to hip hop.<br /><br />The next day I packed it up with my cans and took it on a business trip. The unit refused to connect via usb. I tried the same phone and laptop that worked before but now nothing.<br /><br />For the brief period it was working properly it was wonderful, but judging from the frequent quality complaints in these reviews and my own experience I'm just going to get a refund.

B0002UOK04|5.0|Most of it has already been said in some of the very good reviews and track-by-track breakdowns here.  I just wanted to put my thoughts down here.  Having a very broad range of music that I enjoy, with many favorite albums (from classical to metal, country, pop, punk, ska, electronic, hip-hop - you name it) I think this is one of my very favorite albums.  I have listened to it literally thousands of times over the years and I never get sick of it.  So if you like music with depth, substance, and brilliant composition - pick this up.  Even if you aren't a fan of harsh vocals there is something for you here.  I'm not a huge fan of harsh vocals myself, but everything else about this record just blows me away, and even those vocals really mix well and support the music.  If you don't own this, you need to add it to your collection.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The author provides a candid and easy reading account of what it's like to be a Navy SEAL. This helps place some context around the raid of bin Laden's compound. His message that he is an ordinary guy involved in extra ordinary circumstances comes through very clear. Enjoyed very much.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very well written story from the eyes of a DEVGRU operator. From training to be a operator, missions and finally the one that kills UBL. I really cant say anything bad about this book. Not your typical SEAL book with 1/3 being about BUDS and the rest about how amazing they are. Really just a all around excellent read.
B002EEP3NO|1.0|68 people bought a $400 Lego for there kid? Must everything be over the top in materialism? $400 could feed a family for a year in many places on this planet. Sadly, there is no longer a concept of not spoiling your kids that existed years ago.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|It is a very easy read, not technical at all.  Definitely not a book about learning the skills of the special ops services.  It is a book that lets you in on how they sacrifice their time and everything in order to serve their country and their people.  I really enjoyed reading it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was contemplating if I should bye it because of all the bad reviews like how it doesn't work on the kindle fire I took the risk and it works amazing it is so fun :) I say take the chance even it is a bit pricey I say its worth it.

0156030306|5.0|Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes is a book about a middle aged man, Charly Gordon, who is intellectually disabled.  He has problems with writing legibly, spelling, and with associations.  He is socially awkward and has a slight speech impediment which makes it difficult for him to communicate with his coworkers.  Despite his disabilities, Charly is a happy going guy and determined to improve himself.  Charly ends up getting a surgery that improves his functions greatly.  The book isn't realistic, as I'm not aware of any surgeries of this nature; however, this book could be beneficial for students of all ages if read in class.  First and foremost it would expose children to someone with intellectual disabilities which is someone that they will highly run into since public schools have special education classes and learners with exceptionalities throughout the school.  The book also showed Charly interacting with his coworkers so this would show students how to interact with people who have intellectual disabilities and to let them know to treat them just as a human being.  I believe this book took teach people a lot.  As mentioned, the surgery is not realistic but it is realistic to assume that with hard work and plenty of support, people with intellectual disabilities can improve their abilities, probably not to the extent that Charly did, but considerably nonetheless.  I could have my students even watch the movie that is based off the book so the students could get a picture of how students with intellectual disabilities think, learn, and act.  Also, Charly's coworkers were very ignorant and this could teach students how to and how not to treat people who may have a speech impediment or poor learning skills.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I really enjoy the amazon mobile app, it's fast and responsive, fairly intuitive and syncs up with the site very well. My one gripe with it is that there isn't a tablet version. The phone version is all well and good, but I would like something similar to the iPad app for android tablets (utilizing the extra screen real estate). Other than that though this is THE way to browse amazon on mobile devices.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|I've always enjoyed listening to this album, but that said, it's never been on my playlist as frequently as the albums that flank it chronologically -- \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"The Beatles,\\" better known as \\"The White Album.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" was basically a summation of everything the Beatles as a band had learned how to do up to that point in their history. Vocally and instrumentally, it was challenging, and the sounds included sitar (played by George Harrison), brass and other elements that widened the group's sonic space. It had great songs like \\"A Day in the Life\\" and the title track.<br /><br />\\"The Beatles,\\" the white-clad double album that would follow \\"Mystery Tour,\\" revealed that same band breaking off into their individual components. In short, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison often ended up working by themselves or with drummer Ringo Starr, each man developing his own compositions pretty much as he pleased. Again, the songs were very good, albeit more personal than the ones on \\"Pepper.\\" Some of the best included \\"Dear Prudence,\\" \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mystery Tour\\" sounds closer to \\"Pepper\\" to me than does the White Album. I hear more group unity in songs such as \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and the title track, and of course on the group-composed instrumental \\"Flying.\\" Still, the album shares a passion for quirkiness with the White Album -- and in fact the late John Lennon said \\"Mystery Tour\\" was his favorite Beatles record because it was \\"so weird.\\"<br /><br />I agree it's odd, but it's weird in a very appealing way. And there are a couple of absolute classic Beatles songs here, including \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"The Fool on the Hill.\\"<br /><br />If I were introducing someone to the Beatles, this would not be the first album I'd play for them, but it would be in the first half dozen. A very good effort from the Fab ones.
B007ZD17XO|2.0|I loved Montezuma 2, played through it twice.  So off course I was excited to pick this one up as well.<br /><br />The graphics and sound are crisp and punchy which makes every swipe a satisfying explosion of color.<br /><br />Unfortunately that all comes at the steep price of crippling lag once the action gets going.  Even worse, the in game timer seems unaffected, leaving my swipes unregistered for up to three moves while the clock keeps ticking.  Sometimes a message pops up saying the application is not responding while the timer is still running in the background.<br /><br />It sounds like this is only an issue for some devices, so check other reviews before you buy.  For what it's worth, I'm running this on a Motorola Razor.  I'll keep my eye out for an update, because I do want to enjoy this, but I won't hold my breath.
B0068FZ05Q|5.0|this is a great movie wonderful to watch the only bad thing is that i didn't get the digital copy so that is sad
B008MZPVP4|1.0|Hearing this mess I am so unmoved that I can't even find the inspiration to write a review that will put them down properly. The sludge is in their uncreative process. These people have no inspiration or imagination anymore, and I'm not surprised in the least that they took five years to deliver anything. Ofcourse it might go down well with many fans, given the sad reality that nearly the entire population of earth has reached new heights of being numb, senseless, lifeless and a subset of that get by on this kind of music. Music today, from new bands and veterans is the soundtrack of people that instinctively know that we're in an increasing spiral of destruction, and we're not having much fun with the music that used to work before. Artists have hit the dregs in its search for inspiration. I feel like I ought to say, \\"wash away us all and take us with the flood...\\"

B007FG9LIE|3.0|I was expecting something a bit stranger from this writer.Having read some of his earlier books maybe i expecting to much.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|First time reveiwing a book not sure what to do so this is what I got.<br />Great book, full of drama and love.<br />Love the story line, it's very entertaining. I think everyone should read this book, it has it all from Drama too suspense.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I heard Mr. Tough interviewed on WBEZ and went immediately to purchase the book for my kindle. As a retired primary CPS teacher of 38 years it was so refreshing to hear someone talk about studies that show that students especially young students need skills that are not knowledge based. We have been pushing the academic skills down to younger and younger students instead of giving them the chance to develop those so called character skills. Learning to share, learning to listen, to follow directions, to think for themselves, learning to take turns which are all necessary for them to be  successful students. The other interesting fact was that teacher quality which is such a burning issue lately, really only has a 10 percent affect on the success of a student. Studies show that community,parents and poverty play a much bigger part in the equation. I just found it very interesting that Administrators and Politicians seem to pick and choose their studies. I am not saying that teachers should be  left off the hook. Best practices and continued research is needed to find the best way to reach children of poverty.But banging the drum that all students can learn and at expected rates with out addressing some of the other issues that are affecting our students of poverty is dishonest and a disservice both to the students and their teachers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is one of the best in the Trilogy. This book has so much from happy too sad, and hate too love. You will never want to put it down till it is over. This is a book I can see myself reading over and over again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had no idea what direction this second book in the trilogy would go and I was very satisfied when I read it.  It was exciting and thrilling, I honestly couldn't put it down.
0525953728|5.0|An easy, informative read.  The career of the author as well as the specific story of the Bin Laden takedown will keep your interest from page one.  No military secrets are revealed but certainly it is not the story told by the administration.[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]
034580404X|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but after reading the first 9 chapters I became hooked.  Enjoyed all 3 books and read the entire series in less than a week, it even surprised me that I could read this quick.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This movie is one fantastic movie. Of course Cuba is in it and I really think he is one of my favorite actors. The only thing I would have liked was for Cuba to be the lead commander. He plays the second in command, but his attitude draws in the men to almost the point of being the commanding officer.<br /><br />Other than that one thing this movie rocked!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I love it it is the best app you can see the weather at any time you can also have a great time

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Another fun puzzle game by Big Fish Games! I'm sure everyone would addicted to this game over and over again.
0307744434|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!! It was set on the darker side, but still light-hearted and magnificently magical.  I wish there were more books like this one!
B008602KQI|4.0|Read the book and of course it was much better but all things considered the movie was quite good.  I have enjoyed watching it more than once.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|The visuals of this movie weren't bad, some of the special effects were actually quite good but everything else about the movie was horrible. The acting sounded forced (especially the Queen) and the writing was horrible as well. I wanted to like this movie even though it had Kristen Stewart in it but it was not good at all. Also, it wasn't very original. The beginning is fairly classic snow white and then there is a scene that, to me, seems like it was taken straight out of the movie Princess Mononoke (with the deer-like thing in the middle of the forest on an island and then gets shot by the evil people). If you want to watch this movie I suggest you jump to the middle and skip any parts with the evil queen in them.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|very educational and fun.  My son watches this movie just about every day.  a great buy and I will purchase all the disney nature videos
B009CS61AY|4.0|Really enjoyable book, good twists and turns.  First few chapters are a little slow, but it definitely builds to an all round good book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great book to understand what really happens in war.  Easy reading, very hard to put down. Great to know how it really went down.
B009329ZF2|2.0|An early sequence involving Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) getting tazed for stealing a chicken burrito sets the tone for this misfire.<br /><br />Lots of pretty faces, corny dialogue, explosions and VFX with requisite muscle flexing in this one.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is barely in this movie.  They must have paid him a few million just to fly him to Hawaii, shoot a couple of scenes, and plug his name on the credits.  Same with Alexander Skarsgard, who gets blown up way too soon.<br /><br />Brooklyn Decker (who is funnier and better in Adam Sandler's Just Go with it) as Hopper's hot blonde girlfriend with Hamish Linklater a Jeff Goldblum-esque brainiac comic relief character (think Independence Day) who helps stop the aliens.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Big dumb action movie with lots of Transformer-like alien craft, but they're manned by some of stupidest aliens ever to attack earth.<br /><br />The piss poor script sunk this battleship before it ever got out to see.<br /><br />FYI:  The director and some of the actors have said in interviews that they literally were using the script only as a \\"blueprint\\" and were making stuff up on the set!  That's not the best way to spend $200+ million on a movie.  That's how bad film school students cobble together their final project over a weekend after downing too many beers and chicken burritos!<br /><br />Two stars for the visual effects and using a real old battleship, the USS Missouri, in the movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game<br />love love it you will too.come one come all come play this game and have a ball. its greatttttt. I love it you will love it.
B002C6A6N6|2.0|It is great to have all episodes of a beloved series, but there are some disappointments as well as technical glitches. The DVDs themselves are really no frills - you stick them in and choose your episode. The writing on the menus reminds me of the type of font that computers used to churn out in the late 1980s. Really basic. There are no extra features, no accompanying music to the menu - just stick in your DVD and choose your episode. For a collection of this price, I would have expected a little more.<br /><br />Furthermore, as many of the other reviewers have said, I also had issues with the soundtrack being out of sync with the shows. Definitely a mismatch between when you heard someone speak, and when you see them speak. It is very irritating. HOWEVER, I discovered that if you pressed \\"pause\\", and then resumed, the voices would be in sync. It is completely bizarre but it worked. Every episode so far, has started off out of sync, and then when I pause and resume, everything is in the right timing. So for the others who have had this problem, please try this method. This is the ONLY reason I did not return the collection, since I am managing to watch all the episodes comfortably and in-sync.<br /><br />Overall, a disappointing product. I gave it two stars because, well, I love this series. But they could have put this collection together with a little more thought and do things up a little more fancy.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|The novel itself is a lot of fun, especially for people who followed the sixties' campy sci-fi television shows. The three codas mentioned in the title were another matter. I won't get into them too much but suffice to say I found myself skimming very rapidly through large sections of them.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the novel well enough, but the codas make it hard to reccommend.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Definite way to verify remastered edition is B1R2 on the disc. Thanks a lot to previous reviewers to point it out.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I wanted to read No Easy Day from the first day I heard about it, so I pre-ordered it for delivery on my Kindle on the day it was released.  I began reading it in the morning it appeared on my Kindle and I was hooked immediately.  The writing was very cinematic:  I could envision the action -- from the SEAL training to the night of the raid on the compound -- in my mind's eye.  So clear and compelling is the writing that I had to keep reminding myself that this is a true story, not a novel or movie script.  I had chill bumps several times throughout the book.  The author's voice is authentic and authoritative, and I literally couldn't read fast enough -- I finished the book the morning of the second day.  This is an incredible true story of a real US hero, in my humble opinion, and I am extremely proud of the service to our country of the author.  I know it will never happen, but I would love to shake the hand of the author and say \\"thank you\\" to him in person.<br /><br />I clearly understand the concern that the author may have violated his confidentiality agreement, and he may have to answer legally for writing this book.  However, I did not find any content in the book that I would have considered a breach of inside information on SEAL training or planning and executing this raid on bin Laden's compound.  As I read, I expected a moment (or several moments) when I realized that the author had revealed some deep, dark national security secret, but it never surfaced for me.  Perhaps I just didn't recognize it, or perhaps I've read so many thrillers already and nothing shocks me any more.  Or perhaps there really isn't such classified information in the book after all.<br /><br />I found the book absolutely riveting, and it made me proud to be an American.  I will definitely read No Easy Day again.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Right up there with Fifty Shades of Grey.  Its possibly even better because you don't have all of that dodgy bondage crap and the 'red room of pain'.  Loving the romance and intensity of their relationship, can't wait for the next book!!  :)
B004LWZWBU|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me.  I am what I called a mild bird watcher, so I watched it.  I watched it 3 times in a row even though I was rather depressed that evening.  I laughed and actually forgot my troubles! All the acting was so real...I have seen birders race on to the next after spying one and marking their list.  The makers of this movie were spot on getting the birders and their obsession with birds portrayed so accurately.  The plane ride to Attu and the helicopter chase were hilarious.  I enjoyed this movie so much, I bought it.  Thank you all for making such a fun movie about bird watching with such talent.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I have Angry Birds installed on my i-phone.  It's great fun to play so decided to download it to my new Kindle Fire.  It is even more fun to play on the Kindle than it is on the i-phone.  The graphics are so much bigger and better, even the birds are angrier!!  For 99 cents it's the biggest bargain around. But be careful, you will become addicted!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|All I can say is someone is not telling the truth about this OBL thing!! The Administration and all those congressional persons who were talking right after the take down, are NOT CAPABLE OF BEING LEADERS, these congressional people should be tried for TREASON against the American people [including those upper level brass who talked too]... I am not in favor of our SEAL's ever talking about operations, but in this case it seems the record needed to be set straight... Our leaders in this country need to stop blabbing their mouths like operation security is some kind of \\"POLITICAL ADVANTAGE\\" thing!!! Enough said...
B007GCY8FS|2.0|So I have been anxiously waiting for this book and I read the sample but I am no longer encouraged to get this. The reviews have not been great and I agree with most of them. I have read all Lee Child \\"Reacher \\"books and I am sad to say that I will have to pass on spending the $13 to read this one. Hopefully the next one will be better. Perhaps if its actually written by the author?(now that's a thought). It/s unfortunate that this is the trend for these popular authors. I had to pass on the last 3 James Pattersen books. They were just awful. I hope Lee Child does not fall prey to the money grubbing trend.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I love this app.  It is easy to keep up with all my stocks and see what they are doing; it is easy to read and provides lots of information on stocks and world news.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How on earth did this book become so popular? Unbelievable!<br />First of all, it is so poorly written. The language is full of repetitions and an author with respect of him/herself, should not keep using the word \\"hot\\" all the time if they're over 12 years old. The imagery remains the same throughout the book: so many degrees of shades of this and that.... The characters themselves are cartoonish and unbelievable: the 'heroine' is so innocent at the age of 21, that I think she must have been living on an entirely different planet. It's just not plausible. She keeps biting her lip so many times that it gets so boring to read about, as does the constant references to her 'inner goddess' .....and what's with the (repeated) references to Tess in the great novel by Thomas Hardy? Are we supposed to draw similarities between the two and assume that they are 'sisters in arms'? Gray himself is so perfect that it becomes ridiculous - very much the imaginative man of my dreams at sixteen! Completely incredulous ! I won't go into the sex passages which are completely boring , since they are basically just endless repetitions. If you've read the first one... you've read them all. Quite disappointing, as this is supposed to be an erotica novel.<br />To sum up: Your time and money will be wasted on this book. I give it one star for effort.
0671578855|5.0|Romantic comedy in a science fiction setting, how can you get better than that? Lois - you are the best. I love all of her books, she puts so much passion into them. She is one of my favorite authors. I re-read all her books time and again. My god when Mile's dinner party is \\"breaking up and sinking, all souls feared lost\\" I laughed for about 10 minutes. If you like Georgette Heyer, you will like all of the author's work.

B006TTC5JK|5.0|Harvey is a delightful 1950 farce starring James Stewart as the \\"oh so pleasant\\" Elwood P. Dowd, an amiable alcoholic whose best friend is an invisible giant rabbit, variously reported by Stewart to be either 6 feet 3½ inches or 6 feet 8 inches tall.  For those who are unfamiliar with this story and who may be concerned about the alcohol angle, be assured that there is almost no drinking depicted, and no drunkenness.<br /><br />In a story populated by eccentrics, only two people play it straight:  young Dr. Sanderson and Nurse Kelly.  Around them swirls a galaxy of great Hollywood character actors with quirky mannerisms controlled just enough to keep them believable, rendering a textbook lesson in finely tuned comedic technique. Watch the faces of these marvelous actors, listen to their distinctive voices, and learn how a classic comedy is created.<br /><br />Josephine Hull plays Elwood's long-suffering sister.  Her tribulations with her brother and his friend Harvey garnered for her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.  Jessie White, later known as the original Lonely Maytag Repairman, is an orderly at Chumley's Rest, which he describes matter-of-factly as \\"our nut house\\".  Every character in the story is lovingly portrayed, and none more so than Elwood P. Dowd, which James Stewart said was one of his favorite roles.  He relates in an audio extra that when he played the part on the stage in London, during nearly every Saturday matinee some frustrated child would call out toward the middle of the second act \\"where's the rabbit!?\\"<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of Harvey is wonderfully clean and clear, with no artifacts or blemishes. Those who dislike film grain might be shocked by the heavy grain exhibited in the opening credits, but the film itself displays only quite moderate film grain.  Sadly, despite the improved resolution afforded by high definition, the giant white rabbit remains invisible.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Because Amazon is combining the reviews of Bad into Bad 25 (and probably vice versa as well), please note that I am reviewing the Deluxe (3 CD, 1 DVD) Edition of Bad.<br /><br />THE ALBUM<br /><br />Bad has always been my favorite album. I love Thriller, but for me, it never got better than the 1987 follow-up. It's a fantastically funky album with a perfect blend of rock, pop and R&B, and enough #1 hits to get mistaken for a greatest hits album. But I'm not really going to talk about the album itself; I'd like to focus on the actual edition for those looking to decide whether or not they should upgrade from their 2001 Special Edition disc.<br /><br />And in a word, the answer is definitely. You'll want to hold onto at least the interview tracks with Quincy Jones, the lyrics booklet (sorry, no lyrics included in Bad 25) and (if it's important to you) the intro to Fly Away, but everything else from the 2001 Special Edition is included in Bad 25.<br /><br />The remastered edition of the album itself is a noticeable step up from the 2001 Special Edition remaster (although I wouldn't call it night and day as Bad wasn't really in desperate need of a face lift), however it is more noticeable on some songs than others. For example, it was a lot more evident to me when I played Dirty Diana side-by-side with the 2001 master than with Smooth Criminal.<br /><br />If, like me, you were hoping for the *original* version of the album (as the advertisements implied), you'll be a little disappointed as the versions of Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Dirty Diana and Smooth Criminal are the revised/single versions of the songs from the Special Edition. This means that, even though they remastered the original version of I Just Can't Stop Loving You (with the spoken intro by Michael) for the Walmart-exclusive single a few months ago, it wasn't included in Bad 25... better hold on to that disc!<br /><br />THE BONUS DISC<br /><br />The bonus disc is great! Al Capone (an early version of Smooth Criminal) is the highlight of the disc, but I also enjoyed Don't Be Messin' Round and Song Groove (a.k.a. Abortion Papers). There are a couple slower songs as well for those who really dig his ballads. For the sake of completism, Streetwalker, Fly Away and the Spanish Version of I Just Can't Stop Loving You from the 2001 Special Edition have been remastered and included in the set as well. A few remixes are included, and while they're getting a lot of bad press, I didn't hate them. In fact, I really liked the one for Speed Demon. At the end of the day, they don't take up that much space on the disc, so if you feel like listening to them, they're there, if not, just skip onto the next disc.<br /><br />THE CONCERT<br /><br />I really loved the Wembley Stadium concert DVD, which sounds FANTASTIC in Dolby Digital 5.1. Sourced from the original multi-track boards from the concert, you're getting clean, great sounding DVD-quality audio. Pitch up the volume on a good enough sound system and it's like you're there! Which is awesome because the concert really exhibits Michael in his prime, dancing and singing superbly (unlike many of his performances, he only lip-sings 1 song during this concert for the encore of Man in the Mirror, but he also lip sings the performance of The Way You Make Me Feel from the bonus features).<br /><br />Where the concert DVD stumbles a bit is in the video department. They've done a great job cleaning up the transfer, but no matter how good it looks, it almost never really advances beyond the look of the VHS tape it was sourced from. But they really didn't have anything better to work with and I'd rather have a cleaned up VHS tape to look at than nothing and when I'm watching a concert, I'm really only concerned with the audio anyway.<br /><br />A CD of the concert is also included, trimmed a bit to fit on the CD.<br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><br />Finally, the packaging is very impressive. I loved the Thriller25 Deluxe Edition and Bad blows it out of the water. The box is about the width of four CD cases (and is also a little taller than a standard CD), looks very classy and opens up to package two booklets (one for the album and the other for the concert), a foil sticker of the album cover, a folded poster of the cover of the Bad World Tour program (with another poster of Michael on the back in case you don't like the program cover), and foil-enhanced paper sleeve packages for the four discs. Again, no lyrics in either booklet, but if you can ignore that, the packaging itself is top shelf.<br /><br />So if you're a fan of the album, or Michael in general, I would definitely recommend picking up the set. The remastered album sounds better than ever, the concert is great (if you can grant the visuals a bit of a pass), and the rarities are fun.25 Deluxe Edition and Bad blows it out of the water.

1594745692|5.0|[Box: 10.0] +<br />[Book: 10.0] +<br />[Protection: 8.0] +<br />[Cards: 8.5] +<br />[Art: 10.0] = 46.5<br />* Overall: 9.3<br /><br />Box: The box, resembling an ammo pack, is completely awesome and adds a lot to the style of the tarot. It's the kind of box you would put in a bookcase and just stare at it. When you open it, you see the bullets in the sides and feels how sturdy, protective, it is. The kind of box that would survive an apocalipse.<br /><br />Book: It is small (the same size as the cards) and concise, simple and yet perfect. The pages have an old feeling to them, being yellow and rough. It has more spreads than the usual, like \\"The Severed Head,\\" that fits the style anyone using this tarot seems to be heading to.<br /><br />Protection: If the cards had an additional case to them, a small one, that fitted the cards perfectly so you didn't needed to carry the box to have them protected, I would give it a ten. But inside the box they're protected by a velvet surface that keep the cards the same way you saw them when you first opened the box, and, as I said, the box can take some good blows.<br /><br />Cards: They're great. The only two things I'm going to complain about is the thickness and resistance of the paper. The borders of the paper can be damaged very sightly in the back side and it is thicker than my other tarot cards. But I can shuffle it with no real problems and the printing is perfect, so I'm giving it a 8.5.<br /><br />Art: It speaks to me so clearly that it turned this deck to be my favorite over every other deck I've seen in my life, and I've seen a lot. You can judge by yourself by looking at the pics of the major arcana that are disponible here at amazon. Now, speaking as a tarologue, he meaning of the cards is impeccable as far as I studied them, and they still can have their own originality, as seen in the minor arcana, where the suit of pantacles is substituted by the suit of hazards.<br /><br />If the simple problems I presented weresolved, I would gladly pay double the price I paid for the deck. But for the price it is, it is more than I ever expected. I can only recommend it, to either starters or experts.

0802798225|4.0|Eighteen-year-old Brittany leads a perfect life with her perfect hair and figure, perfect boyfriend, and perfect family...or so she wants everyone to think. Her dad is barely at home, her mom is obsessed with keeping up appearances, her sister is mentally disabled, and her boyfriend only wants sex. No matter what, Brit has to maintain the perfect image, but her world is turned upside down when she meets her chem partner. Everyone fears Alex Fuentes. He's dark, dangerous, and part of the gang Latino Blood. Maintaining this dangerous image it's important to keep his family safe, to keep his brother's away from gang life. But meeting Brit has made him to wish for more, a better life, even though when he knows it's hopeless. Class, race, reputation are all put on the line when these two get together, but they survive the oncoming tide of gossip?<br /><br />Simone Elkeles Perfect Chemistry sizzles with romance, and breaks the stereotypes that rule high schools everywhere by teaching us that sometimes people are not what they seem.<br /><br />Brittany strives to maintain the typical ice-princess facade, first because it's what her mom wants, and second because she doesn't want anyone to know and make fun of the situation of her family. I really wanted her to grow a backbone in those first chapters. She's so fearful of her mom, and she's eighteen for shits sake! But that's alright, because it's thanks to Alex that she relizes life's too short to be living it like another person wants you to, instead of how you want to.<br /><br />\\"If there's one thing I learned, it's that nobody is here forever. You have to live for the moment, each and every day...the here, the now.\\" - Alex<br /><br />Alex's situation broke my heart. All he does is to protect those he loves, his mom, his brothers, and eventually Brittany. He doesn't believe he can better the conditions of his life, and every time he said so, I just wanted to give him a hug.<br /><br />You know you can do more, but everyone expects you to quit.<br />~<br />What is the use in fighting for a lost cause?<br /><br />It's Brittany's perseverance in believing in him, in showing him things didn't need to be that way, that makes Alex work to get out of the messy life he leads.<br /><br />The moments between these two were very exciting and sizzling. I love how they kept assuming things about each other and then discovered things weren't what they seemed. The moments they got to know each other were sweet, and hot, and all kinds of right. But I would definitely label this a new adult, due to content both sexy times and alcohol and substance abuse.<br /><br />Now, though I loved how these two found each other, I didn't like the comment Brit made about changing Alex so one day they'd be the perfect couple. Changing another person so he fits with you, it's so not the right way to be in a relationship, though Alex did in fact need a little adjustment in his life. I also found Brit to be very naïve in thinking Alex would change the minute she gave herself to him. Le sigh.<br /><br />A little pet peeve of mine, and the reason why I stay away from stories with Latino characters, is that I hate it when they use the wrong Spanish word or phrase. Authors, if you're going to use lingo at least use it well. Get real Latino's to check the phrases and that way you avoid the rest of us cringing in horror when we read them. Otherwise, great job on portraying that macho attitude. It was spot on. Seriously.<br /><br />Overall, I love these types of YA Contemporary novels. They have no reservations, they don't pull any punches, they show things how they are and tell things how they are. There's no `perfect' ending without a lot of struggle before, and that's exactly how life is. The themes of race and class are very real anywhere you go, and Perfect Chemistry does an excellent job or building bridges between them.e expects you to quit.<br />~<br />What is the use in fighting for a lost cause?<br /><br />It's Brittany's perseverance in believing in him, in showing him things didn't need to be that way, that makes Alex work to get out of the messy life he leads.<br /><br />The moments between these two were very exciting and sizzling.

0525953728|1.0|Don't bother to read this book.  It will make you sick how immature, juvenile and uncaring our military men are.<br />The author spends an inordinate amount of time describing an ongoing \\"prank\\" involving a dildo. Disgusting and disillusioning.  What a military we have;  and these are the finest of our military??  What emotional immaturity!<br />Please do not allow your children to read this book.  The author supposedly is the son of two Christian missionaries...so glad to be an atheist,  if that is the case.<br />The gratuitous mentioning of anti-Obama feelings amongst the group of operatives who killed Bin Laden has tainted the SEALS forever.  The military should always separate itself from politics or else we just become a Banana Republic.<br />The fact that it has been released just a few weeks before the election tells it all,  doesn't it?<br />BTW,  Mark Owens points out at the beginning of the book that the SEALS waited year after year - for TEN years before they were told to start training for a mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.  Apparently our previous President could not be bothered to make the effort.

Sadly, Kristen Stewart either wasnt given much to do except look angsty or the 5 min chance she got to kick some butt at the end of the movie... or she just played Bella.<br /><br />Secondly, Id like to commend Universal on not only going the Ultraviolet streaming route but also giving us the choice of having our own digital copy we can watch on iTunes or whatever on our actual computers.  I think this is a classy and welcome step from the BS Ultraviolet/Flixster route Hollywood has been trying to shove down our throats the last year or so.  Good job Universal!

B004KZOXJA|4.0|This is the reason adults should read teen literature.<br /><br />Delirium takes drab, disengaged existence and gives it a jolly good shake.  It captures girlish friendship, first relationship, and suburban summer as accurately as a locker door stained with historical grafitti. And it makes me long for the kind of inspiration that only youngsters can sprout effortlessly.<br /><br />Rather than merely take the avenue of Dystopia to that creeped-out shiver down the spine where one thinks, \\"wow, things have really changed in the future\\" (though it certainly has achieved that prerequisite feeling in accordance with the genre), Delirium has managed to tap into a number of themes that exist here and now, that have generally otherwise gone unarticulated.  In fact, this book had me reeling from a frequent shiver down my own spine as I found myself thinking, \\"oh, yeah, that really does happen ...\\"<br /><br />Consequently, this book did more than just entertain.  This book had me wondering whether I myself had somehow been slipped the cure in that Disappearing Act between adolescence and adulthood.<br /><br />Philosophically, the book is sound.  By the end, I was yearning to see a band where the music actually affects me; desiring to jog to the point that the pain and sweat and exhaustion become something innately pleasurable; and wanting to stare at my surrounding so hard that I get that one second moment that could last forever.<br /><br />As for the writing - so beautiful, so crisp and nuanced that it is ideal for a speed-reader in training: it doesn't matter how many words you miss out on, because you know you're going back for a second serve.
034580404X|5.0|I picked up the first book convinced I wouldn't like it.  But the characters and story drew me in.  I read the second and now the third (all within a week).<br /><br />I realize these books have taken a hit from some because of feeling the actual writing isn't up to par.  But give me a good story over a dry exquisitely written piece of literary fiction any day.  As far as I'm concerned any book that sucks me into the story and keeps me reading is a good one.  For me, this was a good book and I recommend you give it a try.

B007MJSYF0|5.0|This is a story about a class of Japanese students who are dropped on an island and forced to battle to the death.  It was an influence for Quentin's Kill Bill movies, and anyone who's a fan of those must absolutely have to see this movie as well.  I'm aware that it's also drawn comparisons with the Hunger Games, but I'm not sure that's fair.  They have similar concepts, but they're different stories and have different points to make.  And Battle Royale itself isn't the first \\"Fight to the Death!\\" type of story anyway, but it sure is one of the best.<br /><br />Now this is a gory little story.  In fact, it's been banned in some countries for violence.  Kids are shooting and cutting each other up, and pretty much everyone's covered in blood by the end.  Personally, I wasn't that shocked by it, but I watch a lot of violent movies.  Make no mistake, this is no simple gore-fest.  This is actually a very human story.  You see all the emotions these characters are going through as they're thrown into this intolerable situation.  This movie exposes the worst humanity has to offer, but it also shows some of the best.  Believe it or not, my sister actually said, \\"Aw, that's so cute\\" multiple times while watching this.  For every character trying to murder their best friend, there's another sacrificing himself for his high school crush.<br /><br />I'll admit I haven't read the book, so I can't say how the movie compares to it.  I've read another reviewer say Kiriyama is underdeveloped compared to his presentation in the book.  That'd be a shame, cause he's a total badass in the movie, and a real-life example of what I like to call \\"main character hair.\\"<br /><br />Unless you're very squeamish when it comes to violence, you need to see this movie.  It's twisted, demented, and full of action, but it's also very thought provoking.  I can't wait for the day when high school teachers start showing this to students in the classroom.  \\"Don't misbehave now children, this could happento you.\\"

0307279189|5.0|This review is about shoes.    One major takeaway from this book is the idea that modern athletic shoes actually hurt our feet by bypassing the natural action of the foot. The book presents the foot as an incredibly engineered, infinitely adaptable little piece of the body. That's not hard for me to believe. The idea is that modern athletic shoes coddle your feet so much that the feet get weak, resulting in a far greater incidence of running injuries (and back problems, I suspect) than people had before Nike and others popularized \\"jogging\\" and the modern running shoe. The shoes also encourage a method of running that causes damage. And, after having problems *caused* by their shoes, changing shoes or adding orthotics, etc., to solve the problem isn't addressing the root cause of the problem: the over-engineered shoes themselves. The book makes the statement that running shoes don't reduce injury, they reduce pain. So if they're accelerating injury but hiding the pain, that's bad. Is this true? Well, the book convinced me.    Naturally, if you've got repaired bone or ligaments in your body, this is something to take very carefully -- and gradually. Talk to a doctor. Or talk to a few until you find someone that you think is really taking a fresh look at things, rather than someone just repeating the conventional wisdom he was introduced to in medical school.    The author of the book comes across as a little over-eager to me, but not to the point where I distrust his message and conclusions. It's a mass-market book and I expect he's trying to keep the pacing of the book fast to keep it interesting. The author offsets this by liberally mentioning names of researchers and one or more studies throughout the book, adding substantial credibility in my view.    I bought some minimalist shoes for everyday wear, Moc3 RunAmocs by SoftStarShoes. ([...]) I've been wearing them only a day now so it's too early for a report, other than to say that they're comfy so far.    I knowin my case, on the occasion that I'm around the house all weekend watching my young children (thus little or no shoe wearing), my knees feel great on Monday. Barefoot agrees with me.    Many shoes make my knees hurt so I've long been on the lookout for a magic orthotic insert and I've tried two or three without much improvement. I'm now headed in the opposite direction: Getting as close to factory defaults (barefoot) as possible. We'll see how that goes. The idea of strengthening my feet by simply letting them do their job without artificial cushioning resonates as a pretty basic idea that aligns with my opinion that the body has an otherwise uncanny ability to self-correct and heal all kinds of problems, given the opportunity.    It was also an enjoyable book. Recommended. I bought the paperback here on Amazon and got the audio CD version from the public library.
1467934925|1.0|This is simply a substandard print of the book. The bindings, formatting of the actual text, and cover appear as if some amateur bought a digital printer and thought they could make money selling public domain books on Amazon. Pathetic - whoever the seller was should be banned...Leafing through the pages - there doesn't even appear to be a publisher credited. No surprise.

B008UTV6S8|5.0|Paul Simon's music has been a part of my generation's life for so long that it's possible that he's taken for granted by some. This magnificent collection of songs,  none from what I consider his lovely, though musically immature, S&G period - save for an obligatory Sounds Of Silence and the resurrected Only Living Boy From New York -  stands as a testetament to Simon as songwriter. There is a reason why he was awarded the Gershwin Prize for American Popular Music my friends. And that reason is that his singular muse, his distinctive style, his constant and continual pursuit of new musical vistas has made him the country's greatest composer of popular song. Yes - above Bob Dylan, and on equal footing with Stephen Sondheim.<br /><br />The songs included in this concert rank with Simon's best, particularly those from So Beautiful or So What. Dazzling Blue is an exquisite gem, and The Afterlife retains its vitality and witty rhythmic wordplay (\\"hey, what you say, it's a glorious day - by the way how long you been dead? Maybe you maybe me maybe baby makes three but she just shook her head\\")<br /><br />The Obvious Child starts things off with a slower tempo than the original - bringing a sense of majesty to its powerful rhythmic foundation. No slowdown for That Was Your Mother - it remains joyful, and its shufflin' Cajun rhythm will still make you jump up and dance. And its during this song - the sixth on the CDs - that the band gels into a groove and really comes alive. Slip Slidin' Away has more poignancy now that our generation is in its fifth or sixth decade. I could go on and on.<br /><br />That said, it should be noted that Simon himself seems to be thoroughly enjoying himself - something not to be taken for granted. Never a dynamic performer who seeks to ingratiate himself with his audience (i.e., the You're The One DVD)  Simon relies on the music itself to do that. In this show SImon seems happy and more than comfortable on stage. As well he should be - his band remains an extraordinary ensemble who do justice to the quality of the music they are presenting.<br /><br />If you are an old fan you will love hearing the Graceland songs, Kodachrome, and Still Crazy After all These Years - songs that have retained their beauty and have gained \\"classic\\" status.  If you are relative new to Simon's recent work you are in for a treat. This is mature popular music in the finest sense of the word. Simon's craftsmanship never quite leads your ear to expected places, and his lyrics are smart, witty, and meaningful.<br /><br />Reading this over, I realize that this sounds awfully serious and somber, where I really meant to be respectful. So let me just end by saying that this set is a lot of fun. It contains joyful music that will bring back memories of your youth, and give you pause to celebrate the moments of today.<br /><br />If this is how terribly strange it is to be 70, well, I'm looking forward to it.remains an extraordinary ensemble who do justice to the quality of the music they are presenting.<br /><br />If you are an old fan you will love hearing the Graceland songs, Kodachrome, and Still Crazy After all These Years - songs that have retained their beauty and have gained \\"classic\\" status.

B000NQRE9Q|3.0|First off I just want to say FIVE STARS for the movies and the transfers. I would definitely recommend you buy this, but only if you're willing to purchase your own alternative packaging. Here's the story:<br /><br />I cannot tell you how overjoyed I am to finally have this set on bluray. Unfortunately as soon as I opened up the package my joy turned to disappointment. There I saw another of these horrible book-style packages that seem to be popular for high profile sets these days (Alien, Star Wars).These packages hold your discs hostage in there cardboard clutches and WILL kill the hostage. By this I mean it is INCREDIBLY difficult to remove the discs from the book pages and over time will scratch them if you take them out more than a few times. Add to that the fact that these discs feel distinctly flimsier than other blurays I've owned and you have a recipe for disaster.

0345803485|1.0|Call me a prude, but I don't like books that condone abusive relationships.  I really tried to like this book, but the characters are flat.  Ana should takes lessons in having a backbone from Bella.  She's pretty much the same as Bella, brunette, stupid, spineless, idiot.<br /><br />The writing is so repetitive.  The only things that happen in the book are Christian Grey being described as hot with his smokey \\"grey eyes\\", his \\"molten eyes\\", his \\"jeans that hang on his hips\\" and descriptions of Ana's intense feelings \\"down there,\\" her \\"mindblowing\\" \\"all consuming\\" \\"earth shattering\\" orgasms, and her inner goddess that I wanted to strangle by the end of the book.<br /><br />If you thought Twilight was a horrible waste of your time, please do not waste your time reading this series.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|Aesthetically speaking, the Verso cover is quite satisfying. It is made of beautiful soft brown (or red) leather, embossed and gilded to give a lovely retro antique tome vibe to one's high-tech EReading device. I love beautifully bound hardcover books and am delighted that my Kindle can look like one.<br /><br />Ergonomically speaking, it could use some work. A Kindle Fire is just heavy enough that it is tiring to hold unsupported for prolonged reading. When opened and folded back, the Verso Case's cover isn't steady enough to form a stand. It just sort of slowly collapses. There is a kind of document pocket on the inside of the front cover that one can slip one's fingers into if one has small hands. That provides some support but it's not very stable. The weight of the device pulls it and the back cover (to which it is attached) down at an annoying angle. If the spine were stiffer, or a band were provided for securing the covers together it might help. Really though, that is just an improvisation, not a purposeful design feature.<br /><br />So - if you want your device to look like an old-world book this is a good product; just be kind to yourself and get a stand as well.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is one of the greatest cds I have purchased in a long time. I am a very picky listener and only listen to what pleases me and not what is most popular. Every song in this cd is superb. The two main vocalists have such a soft and mellow sound that would please even the hardest critics. There is no reason everyone shouldn't pick up this album, unless, of course, they only listen to what's most popular. I myself would rather listen to great artists that no one has heard of than some of the awful artists that appear on the music charts these days!
0525953728|5.0|I listened to this audio-book on Sept. 11 while running 38 miles on my 38th Birthday in memory of those who died and in honor of those who have made difficult decisions and sacrifices to insure our countrymen's Freedoms and Liberties. It was a great thing to hear while I was running 3 times farther than I had EVER ran before. Good Decisions, Commitment to follow through, and willingness to sacrifice your own well being are sometimes needed to accomplish big things and this book is a perfect example of that.

B004ZN9RWK|5.0|What can I say, other than that Dark Side of the Moon is an absolutely essential CD to your collection. Why? Because the music is unlike anything ever heard back then, and even now. The songs are trance-like, melodic psychedelic songs that have a sound that was way ahead of its time, such as the use of synthesizers and sound effects. I'm normally not a big fan of sound effects in songs, but one can't help but fall in love with the sound effects in these songs because they trigger the imagination. Such is the case with the song ON THE RUN, with the running, etc. I also love how the songs run into each other and transition smoothly. Personal favorites of mine are US AND THEM, BREATHE, ANY COLOUR YOU LIKE, and THE GREAT GIG IN THE SKY. This album is progressive rock at its finest, and continues to stand the test of time. Not bad for an album that came out 39 years ago. There are the great albums in the history if rock, then there are the elite ones. Dark Side is an elite album. A must-have. 10/10
030746363X|5.0|Any time I can read something that provides some clear and imaginative ideas that will improve my life - I'm in!!!! - this book does all that - very well - Approach it as an \\"idea\\" book - not a manual to construct your life to - because this is the author's life - use some ideas to customize your life - A great read!!!<br /><br />I followed the diet plan - best part - it opened my thinking to some new ideas - and this book helped me lose 45 lbs so far - in 3 years - nothing fast - but steady and I am strong - in the best condition I have enjoyed in 25 years
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is so fun.ever Denver my parents got it they played every night.we have I pads at schooland during free-time we all love doing temple run.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What an exciting book, I was sad when I finished the book.  I hope there is a second book coming out soon.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Alright so I got this case because I needed a case quick. Because trust me if all the cheaper cases came out I wouldnt have even looked at this case. But I got it and it is very nice. Nice leather durable lightweight. But the only downside is the same like all the other reviews if you want to flip the kindle so the charge port is facing out the open case turn on feature is disabled but it doesn't truly bother me its just a downer. But if that is gonna bother you then dont get this case.
B005WGBOZM|5.0|Can't wait for the next season! I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning. I tried my cable provider to view previous episodes but only could view through Amazon.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Harold & Maude is one of our all-time favorites.  It is not your run of the mill love story or action film, and yet it has both.  The characters are beautifully warped and we have always noticed another missed detail each time we watch.  This was purchased for good friends who have never seen it.  We expect they will be very entertained by it as well.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|The only reason I gave one star, is because I had to. If this app uses free, why would there be a problem with me downloading it on my Toshiba Thrive??????!!!!!! Please fix this.
B006AN4XTU|5.0|What's not to like?  After watching this program, all I want is more!<br /><br />Wish they had not canceled the series. Love it!<br /><br />Hope you like it as well.
B006WXHJNU|3.0|This version with Edward Norton is far better than the other version starring Eric Bana.  I hope if they make Hulk 2 that it will star Mark Ruffalo. I think Mark Ruffalo is a better Bruce Banner than Edward Norton, who was a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana.  The Hulks need their Bruces, otherwise there is not much of a movie there.  Therefore this Hulk is not as good as Hulk in the Avengers, but better than the Hulk in the other film.  It is not a great movie, but it is entertaining and worth watching.
B006KNDVSO|5.0|You just have to love this series. Once you begin watching it and get acquainted with the actors, you then get attached to them.<br /><br />They are a colorful lot!<br /><br />Have to love the anomalies.<br /><br />More please...
B000002KHH|4.0|The whole point of 70s hard rock / metal was to revel in stupidity.  So the lyrics ain't Dylan.  That's OK.  Iommi/Butler/Ward crank out major riffage.  It's a textbook of riffs.  In fact, Geezer is a hell of a bass player.  Ozzy?  Meh.  I burst out laughing at his chant of 'electric funeral!\\" Is this intentionally funny?
B008602KQI|5.0|Awesome movie!I can't wait for the sequels. I was able to share this movie with some who were sceptical about it (children killing each other in a gladitorial setting sounds horrible)and they were able to see that the movie was not about glorifying that but quite the opposite kind of like Ben Hur.
055358894X|4.0|It's been several months since I've read The Lies of Locke Lamora, but it remains one of my favorites still.  Loads of action, great dialogue, very creative writing, and very humorous characters.  It compares very much to a late medieval Ocean's Eleven.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend it to anyone.  The sequel is just as good, and I'm looking forward to reading the 3rd book in this series soon.
0525953728|5.0|I started reading this book with reservations.  I had heard (through the military community) that he had leaked locations of special places.  Well, I decided to check to see how serious that would be.<br /><br />I found that you can go on Google and find a very nice training facility quite easily.  My husband has the zipper across my lips and I am not allowed to ever say the names of any group or groups.  After many applications of duct tape, I PROMISED I wouldn't ever say XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX or anything close to suggest I had a clue about what I was talking about.<br /><br />This author didn't leak anything.  He told a great story of bravery, dedication, families, etc.  I have donated to groups that support our wounded warriors and when I started reading the names in the back of the book I remembered putting wreaths on their graves at Arlington.<br /><br />I would buy this book again in a heartbeat!  I am so proud of him for finally telling the American people the truth about something.<br /><br />Great READ!!!  When I finished it, my husband, you know the one with the zipper asked me what i thought.  I just said \\"GREAT READ\\".
B0002YN376|4.0|A little smaller then I imagined but they are so cute. I cannot wait to give it to my daughter.  Only down fall it comes from Japan so the shipping cost was almost the same price as the product.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|its work just fine even on kindle fire hd. it is a really good app and i would defenatly recommend this app.
B0063GORYU|5.0|keeps me playing for long periods of time. Addictive.<br />I like solitaire of all kinds,  but this one gives me more of a challenge. Thank you.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Lately, Elizabeth Gilbert has been my new favorite author. Her book,<br />EAT PRAY LOVE, chronicles her journey out of an unhappy marriage,<br />as well as her inward journey through meditation as she travels Italy,<br />India, and Indonesia. EAT PRAY LOVE unfolds with an assortment<br />of truly interesting characters, amid the author's personal revelations<br />and tidbits of information on each country.<br /><br />Gilbert experiences eating-bliss in Italy with delectable pasta and pizza,<br />devotion at her guru's ashram in India, and true love in Indonesia.<br /><br />Two characters emerge, both in Bali. First, Ketut Liyer, a medicine man<br />who exudes mystery, wisdom, surprising us most when he reveals<br />that he \\"shares\\" his wife Nyomo with his brother.<br /><br />In their first encounter, Ketut reads the author's palm. He sums up<br />her past, present, and future--then adds, \\"Someday soon you will<br />come back here to Bali. You must.\\" So she sets out to help fulfill<br />the prophecy by planning a return trip to Bali.<br /><br />Upon Gilbert's return, Ketut assigns her the \\"smile from liver\\" meditation.<br />Gilbert was a good student: the book's cover photo features her smiling a<br />deep sentient smile--from the heart.<br /><br />The second character is Wayan, an herbal doctor in her thirties.<br />Like Gilbert, she is a divorcee; unlike Gilbert, she was once a battered<br />wife. Wayan said, \\"To lose balance sometimes for love is part of<br />living a balanced life.\\"<br /><br />Finally, what I love about EAT PRAY LOVE is exemplified when the<br />author writes, \\"I was not rescued by a prince; I was the administrator<br />of my own rescue.\\"<br /><br />--Yolanda A. Reid<br /><br />Author of PORRIDGE & CUCU: MY CHILDHOOD<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0098ASHEE PORRIDGE & CUCU: MY CHILDHOOD]]
1439110123|5.0|I was at a book store in NYC looking for books on the oil industry in 1998 and happened to ask the right person what I should get....<br /><br />I approached a sales woman and asked where I should look for a book on the oil industry.  She claimed to have been an ex-girlfriend of Daniel Yergin and said though they are no longer together she is still a fan of his work.  She told me the prize was what I was looking for....<br /><br />Turns out, she was right.... though it is a long book, it is incredibly insightful on the oil industry.  I was fascinated by the history of standard oil and Rockefeller. Yergin did an impressive job tying together that history of the space with the business the oil industry is today.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It is simple yet challenging. There are man6 levels to play. It is a very addictive game.
B004AQR24W|5.0|You must watch this movie, full of action and the great artists.you cant breth during watching this movie.I love it .
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok some games are fun some are ok and some are boring  other than that i love the game
B00633W614|4.0|Archer's books contain a certain innocence that reminds one of earlier times.  The story is holds your interest even though there are some improbablities that can be overcome. I am looking forward to the sequels  -  have to find out what happened to the Clinton family.
B008VBYN80|4.0|fun but really good kingdoms you fight buy stuff to get bigger, would be better if u had more perks for accomplishing tasks
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day is two stories.  One is the degree of commitment that the Special Operations community must exhibit to reach elite status withing that community.  It is a story that has been told, but each retelling is a reminder that we still have men and women who so value our country they will, in fact, pay the last full measure of devotion.<br /><br />It is also the story of the bin Laden raid and how easily these things can go wrong.  They don't go wrong because of the exceptional skills of these incredible operators.  This part of the story deals lightly with the politics and the reader is left to his own to make a determination as to the efficacy of the political representations that we're made on the heels of the raid.<br /><br />To those who have some knowledge of SpecOps and Intelligence gathering it is an indictment of the President.  To rush to announce the death of bin Laden, when silence would have supported the intelligence gathering operation and follow up will be judged by some as nearly criminal.<br /><br />Buy this book!  Support your own knowledge and the people who fight and die on your behalf.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good book. I don't read much, this was worth it. I would recommend to anyone that has interest in learning about the events that took place that night.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awsome book. i love it better then the first one. well time to read the 3 book. after the 3 book I'm going ti read maze runner
B000Z66RSS|4.0|I love this CD. Not all the songs are great, but the majority of them are. I love listening to it when I'm cooking in the kitchen and when I'm dancing with friends. It's an awesome party CD!<br />I would most definitely reccommend this CD to anyone who loves to booty shake!
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|Not just for kids. This cool little game is thoroughly entertaining. With catchy graphics and plenty of action, you'll have hours of fun.
B008PE9GSA|1.0|After 9 years we get this album with no inspiration or memorable songs.... or even any good songs for that matter.  From beginning to end its just boring, poorly written songs with no ZZ Top flare or power. Not worth it fan or not, simply a bad album.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't usually like books like this, but found it very realistic, sort of like your there with him.  Top reading, my husband is now reading it and says he is really enjoying it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Not knowing what to expect, at first I was somewhat unsure where Mitch was going to take me.<br />It was enjoyable reading and brought forth values of everyday life.  I recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really liked this game. Of course the first few rounds were overly easy, but they got harder and I really enjoyed it. I was sorry when I ran out of puzzles. I hope an update is on the way.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app really does keep an accurate battery level.  Great for kindle fire. I consider this a must have and it's free...
B008XG1X18|2.0|i would rate this app much higher if it actually worked. i LOVE pinterest, and i was so excited when i saw the app came to kindle fire, but about 95% of the time it freezes up my device or force closes. Fix that and i will give 5 stars!!
B004AQR24W|5.0|Long story short this is a great movie! Worth your time if you like action packed scenes with a little bit of humor mixed in there! Highly recommend it!
B0018TNMC0|5.0|Movie came in on time! Classic forever! Great quality! Will get lots of play time from me and my family.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|very limited in that you can only use one character and play one race. kind of a let down since most people are expecting a little more even though its free.
B004PMVSFA|5.0|It is what it is. If you're looking for am Oscar award winning shoe, this isn't it. But if you want a good family movie to watch and spend time together, this is it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Game length was excellent. Awesome all around!! If you are into the search and find mysteries, this one is FANTASTIC!!
B009157BWU|4.0|The only problem I had with the film is it to short. I could have watched two more hours about this family. It's a great story.
B003UESJEM|5.0|I LIKED THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS REAL.  THE ECONOMY SUCKS AND SOMETIMES ITS NICE TO SEE HOW EVEN WELL TO DO PEOPLE HURT JUST LIKE ORDINARY PEOPLE WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS.  AS MY FATHER ONCE TOLD ME, \\"DYING IS EASY, LIVING IS THE HARD PART.\\"  THIS MOVIE SHOWS A SIDE MANY PEOPLE DON'T SEE OF THE UPPER MIDDLE-CLASS AND THE VERY WELL TO DO.  I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AND YOU WILL ENJOY.
B007SGM084|5.0|I took 3 days to read the trilogy. It is a great love story.....if only life was like a story book. I fell in love with the characters and understood each ones point of view. Great read. I'd recommend it to everyone. Great value for money.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I didn't want this book to end; what a remarkable woman Cheryl Strayed is, to have hiked the PCT---alone.  Definitely a great read.
145162607X|4.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter is the story of Anne Neville, the daughter of Richard Neville, known as \\"the kingmaker\\", because he wielded a lot of influence over the kings. Anne and Isabel are pawns in his plans to get one of them on the throne as queen. At the court of Edward IV and his wife Elizabeth Woodville, Anne grows more fearful and desperate when her father starts fighting against his allies. She is married at age fourteen to what she once knew as the enemy, and is soon widowed and fatherless, her mother imprisoned at an abbey and her once beloved sister Isabel married to the enemy. Anne marries Richard, the Duke of Gloucester and escapes from her sister's tyranny. But she is not safe yet, and she is set on a collision course with the power of the royal family.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one, which I received from Touchstone Books. I enjoy historical fiction of all kinds, and I believe that Philippa Gregory has written a lot of books about the kings and queens of England and court intrigue. This one was set in the 1470s, and there's a lot going on. And a lot of names to remember, some of the being the same. For example, there are three Edwards. It was kind of confusing, but very compelling. I really felt for Anne, who is trapped by her father's bad decisions. She knows she is kind of in the wrong, but it wasn't her fault, it was her father's. And because of him, she is widowed and friendless. No one wants anything to do with her. Except for Richard. Anne is considered just a pawn, but throughout the book, she grows stronger and more determined. This was the first Philippa Gregory I'd read, and I liked it a lot. I look forward to reading more of her fiction, though I can imagine how it would become really confusing with all the different names.<br /><br />All of my reviews can be read at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com.
B009329ZF2|1.0|This film tanked at the box office, and there's a reason. Actually, there are many, many, many reasons. It's loud, obnoxious, stupid, preposterous. Based on the board game (never a good premise) of opposing navies doing battle with each other, the film brings aliens into the mix against an international armada. The film starts out with the only decent moment in it- a bungled break-in at a closed convenience store for the sake of a burrito, committed by a screwup and captured for laughs on surveillance cameras. From there, the film goes downhill fast. Flash forward a few years, and the screwup is an officer in the navy. Alien invaders arrive on earth in an advance force of a handful of ships, one of which comes apart and kills a few thousand people crashing in Hong Kong. The rest set up station around Hawaii during a naval exercise, surrounding the islands with an energy shield, trapping most of the ships outside. Circumstance leads to one of the battleships inside the barrier under command of the senior surviving officer, the previously mentioned wash out screwup about to be court martialed for disciplinary problems. Officer Screwup (also known as Taylor Kitsch) somehow manages to get himself into the right command mindset and takes on the aliens, whose ships spend as much time on the water surface as they occasionally- and clumsily- do flying. The alien tech is awkward, shifting and reshaping as the story calls for it, and the aliens themselves are less than impressive. The cast should know better than to have gotten in on this. Neeson and Skarsgard have the presence to be plausible naval officers, and Kitsch plays the screwup reasonably well, though his sudden reversion to thinking like a commander is implausible. These actors are all capable of better, and they do themselves a disservice by appearing in this disaster. Rihanna, whose music I don't personally like, should stick to music. Her acting is abysmal and painfully wooden. Director Peter Berg is capable of so much better than this- this is the guy who directed The Kingdom, after all. By the last act of the film, featuring veterans of the USS Missouri (I hope these guys are just actors, because if they're the real thing, they have not only disgraced themselves, they've disgraced the ship and their crewmates), the film has become so exceedingly stupid that the end result is that you've gone and wasted two hours of your life. Avoid this garbage like the plague.so much better than this- this is the guy who directed The Kingdom, after all.

B0087HT36U|5.0|I love this game the characters are cute and it is a challenge. I can't stop playing please. create more levels.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|Not a bad yarn but the interesting factual stuff - including some fascinating anthropological theories - are interspersed with invented sequences and conversations that the author does not acknowledge as being a creative work in a supposed non-fiction book. He does - in the epilogue - finally admit to honing the story as a bar tale over the years before writing it, but too late. Some of the narrative is also prone to corny similes a la Peter Griffin of Family Guy.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Witty, clever and absolutely hilarious. I love the script, the way the characters play off of each other and the actors did a fantastic job. It's a brilliant modern take on the classic, well loved story. Well done and definitely worth the watch.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|the 'book' no easy day  was very elementary in its writing stlye and gave no details of any plans for the attack and capture..  that had not already been given in tv and news reports.  there was nothing given away about our intelligence.  the book was lacking ... this was a very ho hum book.  i'd not recommend it for 'any body' and feel it was written merely as a commerical.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Look--the Killers make some excellent music. And that voice is undeniable. But they have a real problem shaking up their sound, and album after album sounds too similar. So I love this, but already feel I know it.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|the black cover starts fraying on the ends after so much handling....then you have to start clipping the strings off,which is a nuisance....dont know yet how it will end up looking....
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie is great and one of my kids favorites.  It has a great message as well.  The blue ray looks and sounds amazing on our HD projector and 12 foot cinema style screen.  A must have for your collection.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I swear I start shaking if I don't get to play an hour a day. Come and play, I need the competition on the leaderboards.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator app I have used. After purchasing this calculator, I deleted the one I previously purchase. This is exactly what I was searching for in a calculator app (I've tried a few).  Glad I found this one!
B0088WFZQG|5.0|The movie not only contained some excellent action sequences, but it also delivered on the story line.  I know my son enjoyed the movie for the action and the way the cameras put you right into the action.  Our hats are off to the men & women who put their life on the line for our country!
B0083H6AQA|1.0|I saw a picture in People,of them making the movie and it looked so intriguing.  Plus it starred two of. Y favorite actresses, Uma Thurman and  Kristen Scott ,Thomas.  I couldn't find the movie in Netflix or anywhere else, so I ordered it from you.  It was bad.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|I've bought it for a friend of mine who, like me, loves Sex and the City, she's very happy with it, loves the photos and the informations she found in it.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Great movie, great package. Donnie Yen has the fastest hands I have ever seen, and dramatizes the actions and early life of Bruce Lee's Wing Chun Master.
B001HMSFFC|5.0|I'm a huge Sex and the City fan and I was really happy to see them again, for me this film is not too long, it's just perfect and interesting as any episode of this fantastic show.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher, I wish I could meet him in person  Jack is my hero!!  I always look forward to the next one  Like seeing an old friend!!
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|I'm a huge Sex and the City fan, I loved the first film and expected to like this one too, but I don't like it that much, I found really disturbing and dangerous the publicity it makes (through one of my two favorite characters) to Suzanne Somers' hormone theory (or un-theory, which is what it, in reality, is), I'm really, really disappointed, I'm not giving it one star only because the other parts of the film aren't too bad.
0345536886|4.0|I've read most of Grisham's novels--usually more than once. This one was funnier than the others and an easy read, but that's why I only gave it four stars. I missed the complexity of the other novels. This was a little too contrived and it tied up too nicely at the end. It was good, but not my favorite. Not enough depth.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|My own obsession with Victoriana lasted for a large part of my teen years. I love the manners, style and restraint. Reading copies of 1860s ladies' magazines, I learned about the language of fans and flowers. I discounted the language of flowers early on since flowers meant different things to different people. Why hand someone a blossom that you thought meant \\"please forgive me\\" if it could also mean \\"jealous rage\\"? Too risky.<br /><br />Early on, Diffenbaugh does address the discrepancy in flower dictionaries. This small concession didn't help the text much though. The Language of Flowers is a long and painful journey, sometimes unbearably so. Diffenbaugh's genuine passion and sympathy for children stuck in the foster care system shines through her prose, even when her protagonist is the least appealing character I have read in a long time. The book felt needlessly long and offered a eyebrow-raising conclusion. Perhaps the author would have been better served writing a nonfiction account of her own experiences helping children out of the foster system.<br /><br />I did enjoy the setting, as I haven't read many books in San Francisco. Sadly, it wasn't enough to make up for the alternating maudlin and morose passages.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I received the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit (MC531ZM/A)and was very excited about using it... When I tried the USB Connecting Device, connecting my camera directly with my iPad I got a message that said, \\"Cannot use...USB Device Too Strong\\" Obviously I was disappointed.<br /><br />The \\"second device\\" which recieves the \\"camera memory card\\" worked great; so I was relieved as we are going to France in the morning and I will have something to transfer my pictures to my ipad and not \\"overload\\" my memory card. (We will be in France for 12 days.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book it self was well written. His political view points may not be to everyone's taste but he appears to be just trying to be honest and forth-right about what he experienced and saw happen.<br /><br />Only time will tell on accuracy. We may never hear what actually happened due to secrecy standards.
1781161097|5.0|i wanted to own this book for a couple of months before i could afford it. i visited it in the comic specialty store more then once. now that i finally have it, i'm a very satisfied customer (esp. with the great discount i got!) The interviews, break downs of set pieces, costumes, ships, creatures and the concepts behind them were wonderful, particularly as someone who saw the film in theaters more then once and as someone who has always been interested in the Alien mythos, the creation of the films and the tropes that are explored and subverted therein.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|For years I've seen people play and heard them talk about this game, but never felt the need to try it myself.  After my boyfriend got me a new Kindle Fire for Christmas last year I ordered Angry Birds and figured I'd give it a shot.  I am well and truly hooked now!  In fact, I liked the game so much I ended up purchasing all versions of this game and have enjoyed each edition.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have enjoyed this book for the entertainment and characters.  Not sure if I would have more forward with the relationship if I was Ana.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hunger Games...the characters are just as complex and the plot line thickens as well.  I appreciated that the arena was very different from the first...can't  wait to read the final book.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love the game but stuck any suggestions on how to move on really frustrated right now all pieces move down but wont move over
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It has been 50 years since I wore the uniform, so a lot has changed. Learning about the life of the SEALS was very educational to me.  This book covers a lot more than the Osamba mission. It is a fast reading book that you can't put down. My kind of book.<br /><br />A Hayes
B004QWKIYQ|5.0|Every once in a while, a \\"pop\\" artist comes along that really shines through rest of the Top-40-junk. Bruno Mars is a true singer, songwriter, & musician!

B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Underworld:Awakening(released Jan/12)is the franchise's latest incarnation.It has Kate Beckinsale as Selene,front and center once more(where she belongs),kicking both vampire and lycan butt.Ms.Beckinsale seamlessly pours herself back into her character,both physically and mentally.Starring along with Kate is Stephen Rea as the head of the  Antigen lab which Kate becomes prisoner in,Charles Dance as a vampire elder and a good assortment of other supporting cast members.<br />The film begins with a recap of the first two films which led to the circumstances that this one jumps off from.The human world has now become aware of the lycan/vampire threat and has done major purges to rid itself of these scourges.Selene's lover,hybrid Michael,has fallen into the city river and Kate jumps in after him.The authorities throw in a bomb,which when it detonates,freezes the waters around them,and they are captured.They remain frozen in the Antigen laboratories,the head of which and his son,are both lycans in disguise.Kate,one day,is inexplicably thawed out and escapes the laboratories.<br />During her flight she runs into another vampire,and also comes across a young girl huddling in the sewers,with lycans in the vicinity.She dispatches the lycans and during their meeting,the young girl explains it was her that unthawed her at the labs,as she was also a test subject,and that she is Selene's daughter and,as it is later learned,a hybrid more powerful than Selene and Michael put together.<br />Selene and her daughter flee to a local vampire coven where they are not exactly welcomed by its leader.When the place is raided,it is assumed it is humans,but it strangely turns out to be lycans.As the plot and action further unfold it is learned that the head of the Antigen labs has sent them to retrieve Selene,as her blood is needed to produce a super serum,which is resistant to silver.Selene's daughter inevitably gets captured and Selene must storm the labs to rescue her.In the process she discovers the cryogenically frozen body of Michael,who it was assumed was dead.She has no time but to put a bullet hole in the chamber then flee.<br />When the final battle finishes Selene's daughter gets a vision from her fathers eyes that he is on the roof,but by the time they get there he has fled.The film fades out as Selene makes her new mission known to take back the world from both the humans and lycans,and to reunite with Michael.<br />The plot is a good one,with plenty of action and a body count unseen in previous Underworlds,and that is saying something.J. Michael Straczynski is one board this time around as a co-writer,and as everyone knows was the genius behind one of the best Sci Fi series ever to grace the boob tube:Babylon 5.There is a small problem I have though with the story and that is the daughter,or did I miss something? My question is just how did she come to be? We know of course Michael and Selene were intimate but how the daughter was born in a laboratory,kind of stretches things;at least without some kind of hint.Was Selene actually pregnant when she was captured or did the lab artificially impregnate her during the freezing? But that would mean she'd have to been unthawed somewhere along the line for nine months.Or was the daughter born outside of Selene's womb? Many questions,no answers or hint of one.Would an extended version have at least given us a clue or will there be some type of answer in the next film? We will see.Until then,it is an unsettling part of the story,and I don't like loose ends like this,especially in a storyline of such complexity.<br />Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is commentary.<br />Not a bad addition to the franchise,with Kate back in the saddle again...finally.It is a shorter than normal film(the shortest of the franchise)coming in around 80 minutes.It does move nicely and the action is strong throughout.I have a problem with the addition of Selene's daughter and her origins,which is not explained at all and which we must except on face value.Not good.<br />An above average flick and recommended.r and her origins,which is not explained at all and which we must except on face value.Not good.<br />An above average flick and recommended.
0451169514|5.0|\\"Come on back, let's finish our business in Derry. Bring your jacks and your marbles and your yo-yos! We'll play! Come on back and we'll see if you remember the simplest thing of all: how it is to be children, secure in belief and thus afraid of the dark.\\" -Mike Hanlon<br /><br />Stephen King's \\"It\\" is a wonderfully sweeping tale of what it means to be a child and what it means to leave your childhood behind, inevitably and mostly forgotten, when transforming into an adult. This very evocative tale of childhood orbits and surrounds a tale of exquisite horror. Pennywise the Clown's manipulation of the kids (and entire town of Derry) is evocative of the much cruder Jigsaw from the \\"Saw\\" film series, with components of Freddy Krueger from the \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" films.<br /><br />King's story takes place in Derry, Maine, and focuses on two time periods - 1957 and 1984 - where a group of friends, as children and then as adults, form a magnificent bond to battle foes both natural and supernatural. One member of this group frames the story well: \\"My whole pleasant life has been nothing but the eye of some storm I don't understand.\\"  An eye of a storm is a terrific analogy as the characters live 27 years of relative comfort and happiness, in between their childhood battle with Pennywise in 1957, and It's return to Derry in 1984.<br /><br />King's horror is, at times, quite impactful, but not in an all-encompassing way. There are certain things that I won't quite see the same way ever again, specifically clowns, drains, balloons and spiders, but the story isn't a horror-a-minute. It's grotesque in fits and starts, but it's overwhelmingly smart, deep and emotional.<br /><br />King has created a suite of characters so refined, multifaceted and real, that each embodies components of being that are undeniably relatable. An example from Mike Hanlon's youth, reflecting on the seasonal ebb and flow that become tradition on his parent's farm, \\"Winter was good...but watching his father drive (his beat up old car) back into the barn (spring vanished summer gone harvest-time done) always made him feel sad, the way the squadrons of birds heading south for the winter made him feel sad, or the way a certain slant of light could sometimes make him feel like crying for no good reason.\\"<br /><br />Pennywise is the tool King uses to twist and squeeze the driving themes of his 1,000-page novel: growing up and growing old; memories and the changing cycles of life. His characterizations of each of the individuals and his psychological examinations of what it is to be bullied, haunted and hunted are so keen, one can't help but consider that King has a deep well of personal experience from which to draw. In fact, much of King's most thoughtful prose could be read as his personal eulogy to childhood.<br /><br />King's literary imagery and back-story-building expertise captures children and childhood not quite like a photograph, but like one of those cartoon books where you flip through each individual image with such speed that it appears to be moving. While your eyes see an animation, your mind is still absorbing the individual images.<br /><br />One of the friends thinks, \\"The energy you drew on so extravagantly when you were a kid, the energy you thought would never exhaust itself--that slipped away somewhere between eighteen and twenty-four, to be replaced by something much duller...\\" And this loss of the essence of childhood is what drives Pennywise to bring back the group of friends that almost destroyed It over 25 years ago.<br /><br />Children use imagination, intuition, and have no fear of the future. They will live forever. Adults live with calculation, analysis, rationalization, and fear. In trying to figure out a plan, the adults draw this conclusion: \\"Using intuition is a hard thing for grownups to do, and that's the main reason I think it might be the right thing for us to do. Kids, after all, operate on it about eighty percent of the time, at least until they're fourteen or so.\\"<br /><br />The adult Ben reflects on his partial memories of what happened in Derry in 1957: \\"Maybe that's why God made us kids first and built us close to the ground, because He knows you got to fall down a lot and bleed a lot before you learn that one simple lesson. You pay for what you get, you own what you pay for...and sooner or later whatever you own comes back home to you.\\" Ben and his friends return home, to Derry, to Pennywise.<br /><br />I utterly enjoyed this book. It's long, but fulfilling. And King is so good at character- and world- building, one can't help but be drawn fully and completely into the story. The characters breath and act in very real and 'live' ways.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Man where do I start!!! If you like awesome books, want to get a peek at the Tier One world, or just simply want some motivation get this book!!!! Adam Brown shows that you can go rock bottom and rise all the way to the top!!!!! He goes from a drug addict to one of the deadliest warriors on the planet!!!!! This book also shows you how hard it can be on your family and really how much these warriors sacrifice! There is so much detail of his last mission that you can start to picture it so vividly. I loved this one for sure!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I bought the book despite all of the negative reviews.  Action/mystery novels need action and mystery and this one had only a few chapters worth.  The author certainly could have added a lot more action on the long road trip but for some reason failed to do so. The opportunities were there but nothing happened and I mean nothing.<br />If you like the Reacher series, you'll still like the book.  If this is your first Reacher book, then you probably won't ever read another.  Let's hope Mr. Child's next one hits the spot.  I guess everybody has a bad day (or book) once in a while.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As soon as I started reading it i didn't want to stop, this is definitely one of the greatest operations in ever! Mark Owen did a great job describing how he help take out the most wanted man in America!!! Although the editing was an issue though thats why I gave it 4 stars. Also some topics he kept on talking about over and over and over! But other that pretty good!
B003L77FYS|5.0|I am a big fan of the show but never get to see it when it is on TV. I bought the first two seasons and loved the show so much I orders this one ASAP. It was sooooo good! The chemistry between Castle and Becket is amazing. Some drifts, fights, and close calls with death really make the two of them look closely at what they are willing to do for one another. Not to mention, this season ends with a BANG! I had to order season four as soon as this one was done.<br /><br />Slight spoiler: Honestly, I love that the two main characters don't actually get a chance to fall for each other. From past experiences, whenever the main guy and girl of a show finally get together, the show ends. Everyone likes the tension, not the romance.
B006WXHJTO|5.0|American wedding is a movie i can watch any day of the week!!! it just never gets old!!! So much laughter throughout the movie how can you hate it. I also really love the blu-ray!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun casual for gamers casual gamers really casual gamers in fact if this game was any easier it'd be princess daisy (luigis girlfriend) (luigi is marios brother) but i like it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good read, ignore the press, just read and be inspired. Lots of back story of How we got there in the first place.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|It was great! I loved it. The story was great and amazing sentence structure! But, the beginning was pretty boring. But once your about a 1/4 of the way through the book then it gets exciting!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|After all the money I've spent on zen/relaxation Cd 's ,I love this mix and match to suit your mood,yes their loops but it does all I want and more, and if upgrade to premium you CAN read your books while it plays in background and more sound banks to choose from.worth it all day!!
020161622X|5.0|This book is absolutely on of the best ones in software development I have ever read.<br />Once one learns his first programming language, this should be de next book to read.<br />It is full of great insights, easy and delightful to read. Highly recommended!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good game. its easy to play and you meet the goals quite quickly. it does remind me a lot of farmville. I'm only level 9 and the biggest downside is that you can only control one person...I could use some help from the locals..
B003VANOFY|2.0|Great hardware, but there's deal breaking software issues.  I realized that 7.1 is actually a bad gimmick.  Games mix their sound into stereo just fine, they do it in a way that offers good surround already and lets you position sounds, etc.  It's BETTER to let games mix sound into stereo, because then the sound is actually tailored for two speakers.  However, this headset forces Windows to see it as a 7.1 set, and then Logitech's drivers mix it back into stereo - instead of the game making a well-tailored stereo mix, we're unnecessarily relying on Logitech's drivers, which treats all audio sources equally, to give you a stereo mix.  Sometimes with bad results.<br /><br />This leads to issues like voice chat being drowned out because the game is trying to send it into one of the 7.1 channels, but it gets muffled in the mix.  I can barely hear my friends in Mass Effect 3 and Borderlands 2.  You'll notice other noises sounding loud or not loud enough because of poor mixing.<br /><br />There's a stereo switch, but this is fake too - it just mixes the 7.1 differently, but doesn't truly tell Windows to have software send audio as stereo.  AND it's broken - somehow the subwoofer channel only gets routed the the right ear, so the left is thin and tinny.<br /><br />Logitech has earned a great reputation for me from the g700 mouse, but this product is unbelievably half baked.  Having a true stereo option is a must, I'm tired of wasting my time trying to figure out how to hear my friends, the only reason one would buy a gaming headset over a cheaper and much better sounding pair of Grados or other cans.
B008PE9GSA|1.0|They haven't put out a cd in what 9 years? and all they could come up with was 36 freaking minutes??????? $12.00 plus shipping for a lousy 36 minute disk that will get NO RADIO time at all.Now you know why ticket prices are so high.The cd itself isn't so bad but the shortness of it is pissing me off.I wanted to hear a great cd and just as it get's good it's over.You could understand this in the old days when the band would be on the road 8 or 9 months and then be forced into the studio to crank one out regardless of what if any material they had.The boys should be ashamed of this lack of effort.
B007LHXQEW|5.0|I read all of the reviews before starting the series.  While it is repetitive it is still enjoyable to watch.  The characters have good chemistry and while the story has gone on far too long with too many predictable outcomes; lets face it, it is just fiction.  Over all a good sci-fi show to watch.
0671027344|5.0|One of my favorite books. Well worth it. Came in good condition, as well. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great game.  But either it has gotten more difficult than I remember it being from earlier versions --- or I've just gotten older and slower!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|good setup...alot of fun...great visuals...even my youngsters like it! i recommend it! intend to purchase the full version....we were really surprised
B00425S1H8|5.0|I had zero problems using this with my laptop running Windows Vista. Works seemlessly and is easy to set up.
B006TXDOZ0|3.0|I was truly looking forward to this next release for 'Band of Skulls'! However, their second effort falls a bit flat of the first CD. The blues vibe seems gone from the heavy songs and the psychedelic atmosphere is all but absent from their softer tunes. The result is a more 'sterile' sound and songs that lack character. Moreover, what happened to Russell Marsden's voice? Much of the gritty and crackling nature is gone herein. It blends too seamlessly with that of Emma Richarson's to a point that his contributions become lost. On their debut, it was the magic of two diametrically opposite voice styles, which traded lines and then blended into one voice greater than just their individual summation, that was so intriguing and captivating. Bring back the style and edginess please!
B0037A4ILC|5.0|When I was a tot in the 30's my parents regularly attended a motion picture theater in Irvington, NJ that featured German films and I remember the dramatic mountaineering films that were a common staple of that time.  When you view this DVD you will understand why.  I even remember one title, \\"Gewitter im Mai\\" which translates to \\"Electrical Storm in May\\" which was, supposedly an uncommon event and therefore extra hazardous.  I rented this DVD from Netflix and I was very surprised to experience the same thrill from this modern day version as I did years ago; I even remember the large telescopes that were set out on the viewing deck of the hotel for the guests to watch the progress of the climbers. There are a few surprises about the railway system inside the Eiger mountain that I won't reveal; you have to see this \\"North Face\\" DVD for white knuckle viewing and the portrayal of the fate of those early pioneers of mountaineering. Hearing them described as \\"vagabonds\\" in the \\"Extras\\" section of the DVD surprised me and I equate their reputation to that of our surfer community today.  I bought it because I'm sure I'll enjoy it again and I also plan to spring it on some future guests of ours who are in the mood for viewing something during a visit.  It's suitable for children, if you don't mind them waking from nightmares, screaming for several weeks afterwards.  Enjoy, and be warned; as an adult, you should be able to handle it!
0345803485|5.0|This book was intended to be a good fun read. Not an intellectual book. I liked the fantasy in it and it gave me something to escape the \\"real world\\" for a little while. It may have not been the best written piece out there, but hey! This woman obviously did something right!
B008220AVW|5.0|I really enjoy Perry.  She seems like the real deal, i.e., not egocentric.  She's really pretty, talented and has a bubbly personality to go with it.  On top of it all, she has a good, strong voice, and amazing camera presence.  Her videos are first class.  I thought her \\"Teenage Dream\\" video was very moving.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This was a fun book.  I was attracted to it because it was about a boy shipwrecked with a tiger, which I thought was an interesting premise, but my favorite part of the story was actually the first part, which told of the boy's upbringing in India.  The lifeboat part was cool too, but to me, the ending was fuzzy and not very satisfying, which is why I gave it the 4 stars instead of five.  Doubtless it was ended this way on purpose, but I would've liked a better closure.  However, getting to the end of the book was enjoyable!
B0094OLFUW|5.0|*Disclaimer!  My husband hates it when I write reviews on his account but I don't have my own...so this is his wife.*<br /><br />Anyway, I read the reviews that are here and I really felt that another side should be heard.<br /><br />I had never even heard of XX before the release of this album.  I saw a link to the full album on Reddit and gave it a listen.  The first time through I was initially interested and within a few minutes I was moving on to other things while it played in the back ground.  I thought this meant it wasn't that good, at first.  But then I found myself wanting to listen to it again and again.  I would have lyrics repeating in my head a lot, in a good way.  Then I realized it's value to me.  It's the perfect mellow out background music because it's not overpowering but still pleasant and leaves me feeling happy.  So, I give it 5 stars because I liked it so much I'm buying it right now.  It is what it is, and if you leave your focus on that it's nice.  I'm off now to check out their other album that so many of you loved.
B0041VXGRS|3.0|This book has great descriptions and is an easy read. However, most of the supplies required to make those \\"Oh-so-cute\\" faces, are not easily attainable. I even went to a cake supply shop, in which the store clerk said even the store had a hard time finding certain items I was in search of. Also, the edible food markers do not work! I was very mislead, and highly irritable while working on a project from this book. Granted, I did try one of the more detailed projects. I would still recommend this book to others, and I will be referring to the book quite often I'm sure.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Admittedly, I saw the PBS Masterpiece Classic version of this story before ever picking up the book. My reasons are my own but I have to say - neither disappoint. Though it's no surprise that the two stories are different in many ways - the book version is so visceral and touching. It's no wonder that since it was first published in 1847, it's never been out of print.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you do have survival you are prob on peacfull they have skeletons creepers spiders and zombies..they have chests beds and food and farming. so learn about minecraft would you!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|very thought provoking and challenging game.  I am looking forward to level updates to further challenge me an my family.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good Book, easy read. Everyone should read it, and give thanks to all the people involved! Hats off to our military. Thank You.
B000MQPKVG|5.0|Fantastic film devoid of all the rush and clutter of modern day movies. Kubrick knew when to move the camera and when to hold still often creating frames that look like something hanging on the best museum wall. This film also uses zooms---usually something good filmmakers avoid. But Kubrick often uses them to start tight on some object or person and then very slowly pulls back to reveal the larger world. Amazing film.<br /><br />The story is darkly funny and tragic. Barry gets himself into all kinds of<br />unpleasant situations but this movie ranks as one of the master's greats. One of many.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|We travel a lot and over the years have carried laptops and a great variety of recorders to back up photos we have taken.<br /><br />Now that I have convinced my wife she can do everything she did on the laptop on the iPad (thank you Steven!), this device allows download to iPad and then, upload to the Cloud. Pounds lighter and perfectly secured backups!<br /><br />Now, I need to go back to Morocco and retake all those photos I lost when the DVD was lost!<br /><br />Keep up with technology on Amazon!
B008602KQI|2.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Games movie itself, my issue is that the audio is off and this is the first video I've watched on this device that the audio has been off, so I know it's not an outdated adobe like the amazon techs would like for me to believe.  Also, I purchased the movie to have on my tablet so I'll have something to watch even if I don't have an internet connection.  I was not aware that I would have to be logged into Amazon in order to watch this movie.  I have brought this to Amazon's attention twice and have gotten no response or attempt to help.  I am very disappointed in Amazon.
B000IDEORY|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites.  Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are great together and have a lot of chemistry.  I could watch this over and over ( which I did). It leaves you with a great \\"Time of My Life\\" feeling. ( I also purchased the blu ray.)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game so fun and addicting&hellip;&hellip;I can't wait for the next update :)<br />Is just like the PC version but better because it's touch screen<br />also still missing some cool stuff like wolves, nether, villagers, buckets,ETC.<br />Still im very happy on buying this app.
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|This movie was ill-timed as the country struggled (and continues) to feed their families -- yet the girls continued to experience incredible indulgences.  Although SITC was never quite set in reality, instead of maintaining a relative connection with the real world, this movie veers off into the ludicrous.  Miranda leaves her job because her boss is a jerk -- even lawyers are experiencing record unemployment.  How many people have that option today -- most would have to decide which of their multiple jobs is the worst and then question whether they should quit it anyway -- knowing there are probably 100 people waiting, begging, to take it.  Miranda then finds the \\"perfect\\" job seemingly without challenge.  This franchise was never about women dealing with real issues, but come on -- people are homeless, kids are without healthcare, and these people have the luxury of eating out/daily take out, the ability to quit a job because it is not ideal -- all of which is beyond silly and a disingenuous model of how people (have to) live in today's world.<br /><br />On top of the many cultural insensitivities both here in the US and abroad, this movie is just awful.  The story is thin and plain nonsense.  Samantha is a caricature of herself.  Her behavior, here and abroad, is illegal -- her panties off in the office and her touching herself in full view of others in the office is at the very least inappropriate, as well as likely illegal as exposure.  While I don't condone a culture that forces women to cover up, her incredible lack of respect for the culture she was a guest in, disregarding the numerous and frequent pleas of her friends to rein it in, well, we have seen the world impact of disrespect of other cultures in the past couple of weeks.  Had Samantha been a real US citizen in the UAE and behaved as she did, she would likely be in jail over there and part of a State Department negotiation for her not to be jailed indefinitely or executed.  This story line was NOT about shedding light on the condition of women there, it was a vehicle for Samantha to be \\"outrageous\\" and \\"funny.\\"  Maybe I have gotten too serious and this kind of frivolousness is beyond me, but I look at the landscape of what is, and then see this movie and wonder \\"what on earth were they thinking  . . .\\"  Shame on SJP and her crew for not demanding that this movie be more, to be something other than what it is -- crap.ut shedding light on the condition of women there, it was a vehicle for Samantha to be \\"outrageous\\" and \\"funny.\\"  Maybe I have gotten too serious and this kind of frivolousness is beyond me, but I look at the landscape of what is, and then see this movie and wonder \\"what on earth were they thinking  . . .\\"  Shame on SJP and her crew for not demanding that this movie be more, to be something other than what it is -- crap.

Just so you know and don't wonder what's going on when you read this book!<br /><br />This is the third TPB I've read from the \\"New 52\\" universe, and I have to say that this is easily the strongest of the three. Unless you are a Batman fan who just can't abide the discontinuation of prior continuity, there's really nothing NOT to like here. This book is really, really, good, and I eagerly look forward to the next book in this series.<br /><br />Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo kick-start this new series with great aplomb, providing the most interesting Batman story I've read in years, combined with some of the best artwork seen on a Batman book since Jim Lee's run a decade ago. I remember many years ago when Greg Capullo was first starting to hit it big. He had a run at Marvel with X-force and then switched over to Image where he illustrated Spawn. I haven't heard much about Greg in the past few years, but this book is sure to place him back in the spotlight. The book looks great, and this is not only due to Greg's fantastic pencils, but also to the capable inker and colorist on the book. Everything is fantastic. I could go on and on about Scott Snyder, too. This guy continues to impress me with each new offering. The mystery he builds in this new book is his best work, to-date, and I know I'll be in for the duration of this storyline, which seems destined to go on for the first year-and-a-half of the book's run.<br /><br />Overall, I'm just very pleased with this re-launch, and I'd highly recommend this book to all Batman fans. It fires on all cylinders and will take you for a ride you'll remember for a long time. Loved it!<br /><br />Writing: 10/10<br />Artwork: 9/10<br />Cool Factor: 10/10<br />Value: 9/10<br /><br />Overall: 9.5/10ighly recommend this book to all Batman fans.

0525953728|5.0|As a former naval officer I was concerned about the book possibly violating security and endangering other special operations and operators.  I found nothing in the entire book that one can't see just about any day on the History Channel.  No Easy Day is a well written first hand account that balances distortions from the media.  Politicians may object to Owen's feelings about politics and lawyer set 'rules of engagement', but I find his concerns similar to how we felt about  being 'micro-managed' from DC during our Vietnam service - trying to serve our country with one hand tied behind our backs.<br />Bravo Zulu Mark and all our special ops people.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|This book was recommended to me by my manager and I found it to be a great mind opener book that gives you a new angle to success.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I have been a Testament fan since new order, and this has to be the best album they have ever put out. Just one listen all the way through, and instantly every  song catches your ears! This album is not only heavy, and fast but also very melodic. Alex Skolnik as always, shreds like he has before but with a new ferocity in his solos. I cannot take anything away from their previous albums, but Dark Roots, by far is the best all around album. My favorites on this album are \\"true american hate\\" and \\"native blood\\". If you get the deluxe version, it includes a cover of \\"powerslave\\" from Iron Maiden and \\"animal magnetism\\" from Scorpions. I really like the \\"powerslave\\" cover. Excellent metal album from the mighty Testament!!! Eric
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book is raw and intense from start to finish.  Like the story the characters are raw which draws you in to both the light and the dark of their personalty. This story and its depiction of the power of a Mother's love or lack there of made for a book that I couldn't put down.
B006JD48NM|4.0|During an interview, a former F1 world champion questions Senna's race tactics, he accuses Senna of often colliding with opponents while racing to gain advantage in one way or the other. Senna's response to the champion, who used to be his hero/idol, alone makes this one of the most exhilarating documentaries I have seen since Tyson. What can I add to that? Nothing.<br /><br />Watch out for the rivalry between A. Senna and A. Prost!

1451683405|4.0|Luckily, in my case, this book only strengthened what I intutively understand about my being. It's a shame that most will not believe Sam unless it's shoved in their face with objective facts. Frankly, he is right, but seeing how this is going to challenge so many basic delusionary traditions about how humans face their reality--it will be tossed in a corporate library for furture exploitation.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Not as if I didn't love pinterest to begin with. but this app is great for touch phones and esp kindle fire. on the main website I had a hard time pinning some thing off my phone. but this app makes it easy and hassle free, mostly... it does freeze at times and has forced close on both of my devices. But the FC aren't excessive and I am able to live with it. Down fall of this app~ I work full time and I really should sleep some nights, and this  defiantly interferes!  but love pinterest
B008KNUKVI|5.0|The group is amazing.  I liked each song on the album and will definitely buy the next one.  For the price, I recommend this album to everyone.
B008HK3XU4|2.0|As others have stated the case is not well designed.  Cannot charge without sacrificing the sleep/wake feature.  Pros<br />Are the cheap price and cute color. Ordered the case made directly by amazon and it is superior and well worth the extra money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thought is was a great description of what happened that day. I do not think anything was revealed that we did not already know. Thank God for the courage and brave Seals that went on that mission and accomplished what they did. Great book,well written, and thank you Seal.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Man oh man is this movie good. Not just good, but great. Wait, not just great, fantastic. Oh wait, not just fantastic, PERFECT! I love the Nolan Batman's and I love Batman. This is the greatest ending film to a trilogy ever. I have so much to say. Everyone, everything, all perfect! Nolan has outdone himself again. This is how I will remember Batman. These three films.<br /><br />25/5 Yep, once again, just like the Dark Knight, 25 out of 5!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Even without overclocking this CPU, it's still a beast, and has torn through everything I've thrown at it.  Intel's pinless design is nice, one less thing to worry about.  Stock cooler is adequate, but a bit noisy.  I replaced it with a $25 aftermarket cooler, which has been silent and kept the temperatures lower than the stock cooler ever did.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is an absolute MUST READ. An incredible journey that had me laughing out loud in some places and sobbing with a broken heart in others. An incredibly detailed world with characters that were so well created that I felt like I was standing among them. I have read hundreds of fantasy books and then only series that this book could be compared to is game of thrones.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was unhappy with the stock heatsink that came with my i5 CPU, so I picked this guy up, and I'm glad I did.  It's a hulking piece of metal, but it works great, installed easily, and now keeps my CPU 20 - 30C cooler than the stock cooler did, along with providing completely silent operation.  Make sure that you have adequate room in your case, and that you don't have any ridiculous heatsink-sporting RAM in slots that are a bit too close to the CPU socket, but for most people, this should be an easy buy to make.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This is the gift for my friend.<br />I need the deluxe version because I love the spanish lady so much:)<br /><br />Love this CD.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book was a enigma that made my brain hurt. Trying to digest all the story lines while waiting for them to complete was weird.  I feel like I have been on a expedition....... But it was probably the best book I have ever read.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Reads like a Tom Clancy novel. Describes the events on the ground to take out Bin Laden in remarkable detail. Without spoiling it for those who haven't yet read the book, I'm reminded of the old adage about best laid plans. Despite all the planning and training and practice runs, it very nearly fell apart early on. Thoroughly enjoyable read.
B008QE9VJI|2.0|Finally bought & watched this (on iTunes) and it is god-awful.<br />A romantic scary icon turned into an unwatchable BOMB.<br />Some of the original story is there but so much wasted time spent on cheese (that could have been spent on story): the Barnabas/Angelique hookup, the Barnabas/Julia hookup (?), Barnabas looking for a safe sleeping space, the Alice Cooper songs and scenes, and the over the top ending (Ridiculous)!<br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />I was devasted to see the home  destroyed.<br />I also did not like Eva Green as Angelique. Or Helena as Julia.<br />Total waste of $$$$.<br />What I did love: most of the visuals -- except for Barnabas's makeup and hair. Sets, clothes, & CGI Collinsport were all great. Too bad the story was treated with so much disregard. (Who cares about the cannery? Not me.) Actors that shine despite the writing: Michelle, Chloe, Bella (not in the movie enough), Gulliver. Even Depp had moments.<br />All in all a failed attempt to revive a beloved iconic show.<br />Better luck to the next time!
B00004YWAG|5.0|Music (court, chapel, popular), history and politics (Carlos V - the 'first and last great Emperor of Europe', as Savall writes), culture and religion --- all intersect in this disc and its documentation which make it essential for all serious music lovers as well as cultural historians of all stripes.  It is impossible to conceive a superior sound picture of the 16th century and one is left with the conclusion that this period was the absolute zenith of European civilization. There is also an extremely fine disc by Alexander Blachly and Pomerium built around the same theme as this (Carolus Maximus) which is fully worthy of acquisition as well; it features perhaps less variety than this, but is an equally superb recording.
0671578855|1.0|I really liked this series until this book.  This book should be titled Sex changes and Miles acts emotionally like a women\\".  In all fairness, this is a common issue I have with most female authors, but usually there is enough action & adventure that it does not bother me much.  I would guess that many women feel the same way about how male authors portray females in their books.  Hope the next book in this series is better or it will be the last one for me.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have the Kindle app for all 3 of my Windows computers (I couldn't get the \\"insert a product link\\" to work so you can get this same app for your windows computer at http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=kcp_pc_ln_ar?docId=1000426311. I have over 50 or so books on it so far and was just a few weeks ago talking to my mom about getting a Kindle. It is convenient for me to have the computer app though as I am a full time student getting a degree in Internet Marketing/New Media online so I spend a great deal of time on my computer. It has become a part of me at this point, I think.<br /><br />But, I also downloaded the Kindle app for my Android phone which I was asked to review. It absolutely makes me so angry I see red and I am a pretty laid back person about technology because when you deal with them all the time; you must learn patience for those days that they have minds of their own.<br /><br />But, seriously, the Kindle app for my Android worked fine for the first 2 books I got. Ever since, it has been a battle between me, the app, and the Amazon site as the app will not sync all of the books I have on all of my other apps. I have done everything I can think of. I have uninstalled it and re-installed it 2 times and still nothing. I find it so frustrating because I really really want it to work. I LOVE the kindle idea. I live in an apartment and do not have a ton of room for hard cover books. Whoever thought up the Kindle idea is brilliant. It is perfect for people now a days who are always on the go; but I BEG of you, Amazon, re-evaluate your Android Kindle App PLEASE!!! PRETTY PLEASE!! It was so great having those first 3 books with me everywhere I went.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and I do hope if you do download the app as I did; you all have better luck.<br />Regards,<br />~ Holley Jacobs
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book of The Hunger Games starts off kinda slow. But it does pick up towards the middle and leaves you wanting to know more at the end. It's an easy to read book. My only compaint is there is just way too much tiny details in Mrs.Collins three books. I actualy enjoyed the movie better than the first book because it didn't incorporate those details. But it was fun to read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have had an android phone for years and I have many apps on it for my social media. Since I am getting my degree in internet marketing especially blogging and social media; I have many sites that I participate in. But, my ALL TIME FAVORITE social site is 1000000000% PINTEREST. I adore the site. I can't explain it other than I love photography, organization, user-friendly, finding new things, and learning about new people. This describes Pinterest to a \\"T\\" and I was lucky enough to get an early invite. I have 126 boards and over 7000 pictures. I try to spend some time on there everyday but with school and life; it is hard. But I was so very upset when I couldn't find any decent app for Pinterest. While traveling is when I spend a lot of time with social media. I am an avid photography lover and hope to one day pick that up as a VERY SERIOUS HOBBY. I have probably 30+ boards on Pinterest of just different photographers and their work. I am so in love with such different types of photography. I had no clue such masterpieces even existed.<br /><br />I think this is why I love Pinterest so much. It has opened so many doors for me to learn about some really neat new things in this world. And to be quite honest, it sucked not being able to use it on my phone. No offense, but there are some apps out there that tried to help and make apps for Pinterest and believe me when I tell you I tried them ALL. Now, my Pinterest Journey has come full circle as Amazon gave me the Pinterest app (and it is free - BONUS!!). Now I can officially re-start my quest on finding great photographers and their art while driving and traveling.<br /><br />THANKS SO VERY MUCH AMAZON!!!<br /><br />~ Holley Jacobs

0525953728|5.0|I purchased the audio version of this book, as I drive a lot in my profession. I liked this book so much I listened to it twice. It flows well and it's easy to follow.  Parts of it are intense.  At other times it's educational and enlightening.  There are even a few moments you will laugh out loud.<br /><br />I was so impressed by how humble the author was and how much respect and admiration he had for others in the military, not just his fellow Seals. You Mark Owen, as well as all our military men & women, are real American heroes.<br />Thank you for your service and God be with you.

B001EBWING|5.0|So, D is reviewing Casablanca. Actually, it makes more sense that Casablanca reviews D. D is the kind of guy who wants to want to be like Rick, lacks the courage (but admires the most) Captain Renault, but in the end is really a lesser version of Ugarte. D is of older production values with hackneyed writing, full of antiquated cliches, even cornball values. Or is it that much of D's creativity has been copied so much that it seems out of date, but really is the new value set of all the young kids trying to change the world into a happy ending. Don't they know that there are spies for the other side trying to undermine all the good generous and kind people in the world who only have Paris, Texas or Paris, Las Vegas or Paris, IL or....
0805095535|4.0|A number of words come to mind when one considers Paul Auster's new memoir, Winter Journal - unconventional, personal (almost by definition, I suppose), rambling, confusing, boring, frustrating, rewarding, revealing, gratifying, moving.  Consequently, although many readers are certain to appreciate the book, I suspect that an equal number will end up considering it a waste of precious reading time.  Auster, in his sixty-third year when writing Winter Journal, has produced what his publisher calls an \\"unconventional memoir,\\" a \\"history of his body and its sensations.\\"<br /><br />And a memoir that includes a list and description of every scar on the author's body - and how he earned those scars - along with a description of all twenty-one addresses where his body has ever resided (a descriptive list that burns 53 pages of the 230-page ARC edition of the memoir) is exactly that.  The publisher, of course, uses the word \\"unconventional\\" as a selling point, but I am not certain that readers will necessarily agree that this much unconventionality is a good thing.  The section on a lifetime of living space will, in fact, likely be the tipping point for those readers who might already be starting to question the Winter Journal reading experience.  They will either make it through these 53 pages, and the rest of the book, or they will give up somewhere in the middle of the list.<br /><br />Surprisingly for such a short book, Auster also devotes almost ten full pages to recounting the plot of the noirish 1950 movie D.O.A.  Again, unconventionally, the author devotes as much time to the details of the film as to the reason he references it in the first place - Auster's experience with panic attacks.  Admittedly, the main character of D.O.A. suffers a classic panic attack of his own, but reading ten pages of movie recap grows rather tedious.<br /><br />The book may be uneven, but moving moments are sprinkled throughout.  Auster's memories of his visits to Minnesota and the pages he devotes to personal relationships (particularly to his relationship with his second wife), for instance, work beautifully.  There is a horrifying memory of an encounter he had with a Parisian piano-tuner while living in France with a girlfriend.  There is the moment during which the author reflects on Joubert's thoughts on growing old: \\"One must die loveable (if one can).\\"  Auster explains his understanding of the Joubert quote this way:<br /><br />\\"You are moved by this sentence, especially by the words in parentheses, which demonstrate a rare sensitivity of spirit, you feel, a hard-won understanding of how difficult it is to be loveable, especially for someone who is old, who is sinking into decrepitude and must be cared for by others.  If one can.\\"<br /><br />Consider, too, Auster's recollection of an observation generously offered him by an aging French actor:<br /><br />\\"Paul, there's just one thing I want to tell you.  At fifty-seven (Auster's age at the time of the conversation), I felt old.  Now, at seventy-four, I feel much younger than I did then.\\"<br /><br />Confused for a long while by this observation, it is only several years later that Auster comes to believe the actor may have been telling him that \\"a man fears death more at fifty-seven than he does at seventy-four.\\"<br /><br />So there are wonderful moments in Winter Journal, and there are whole sections that left me wishing the author would simply get on with it.  Unconventional, it certainly is.<br /><br />Rated at: 3.5s he devotes to personal relationships (particularly to his relationship with his second wife), for instance, work beautifully.  There is a horrifying memory of an encounter he had with a Parisian piano-tuner while living in France with a girlfriend.

B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Wasn't expecting this movie to be as wonderful as it is. Definitely worth watching!  It is sad, funny, serious, uplifting, insightful and a lot more.  I don't think the depiction of a mental hospital was very accurate but I loved the characters and thought most were honest portrayals.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|The reason I got this album was the first track ANGEL DANCE. The Droning Bass is superb. I think it was the clip with Robert riding in the back of the Long car ( Limo ? ) that kind of catches your attention, since it is laconic,<br />much like the way some of the songs on this CD / Album are approached by Plant. He has this well known way of<br />approaching any song and making it his own. When I originally heard Plant, it was not a big deal for me, except<br />that i thought he was a superb singer in a great band. But once I heard him do CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE at<br />the memorial Concert for Freddy Mercury, and he totally made it his own, it was then that the genius side of Plant<br />clicked. also, he was the one who revealed that most people performing Mercury's Songs were changing the key ( and<br />only Annie Lennox should never have touched the song she performed, she can sing, just not the one she chose). The<br />album is a walk through history, and if you have heard the interviews that Robert Plant did at the time of his<br />promo \\"tour\\" of the album, basically a few interviews, he talked with great care about the songs, and some<br />reviewers have criticised his choice, saying things like, \\"well, we don't need another version of ...\\" but the way<br />Plant does this material, I would say most definitely Yes we do. I have recommended this CD to a wide range of<br />people, who like a wide range of songs, and I was surprised at the eclectic response from people, as well as<br />different  musicians. Its good to see a Master Craftsman at work, and when that Craft is his voice, and the voice<br />is still in top form, thats great. Hopefully, with The Zeppelin Guys in for the December Kennedy centre awards,<br />Jason Bonham might be hiding around, and we might get to see more history in making, Ledded or Un-Ledded. This is a<br />great album in just so many respects.<br />  I will add that the CD package, designed by Plant is great. A little booklet done with a sense of mirth and joy with life. The artists working together on this package have created a great package in many respects.done with a sense of mirth and joy with life.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I think the first two books were better but once you read those there is no point in leaving out the third...happy hunger games :-)
B00007KWHP|5.0|Fragile indeed, if you look at the way it was held together. Songs like WE HAVE HEAVEN always seemed to weave a<br />kind of audio impression for me.ROUNDABOUT was an almost heavy sound but still had that variety of light and shade.<br />And for me, the first impression I had of YES was broad, the Broad vinyl Gatefold of TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS<br />always seemed to dominate my impressions of other work by YES. And it was significant that when I bought the tape<br />of FRAGILE ( I only had a portable unit, pre-headset days), and all of FRAGILE was on one side, and on side B was<br />ALL of CLOSE TO THE EDGE. So I got a double whammy of yes for the price of one. Since most of my friends liked rock<br />( I did as well, just that I liked YES as well ), but hated Anderson's vocals. Probably outside of the full<br />impression of the band, the vocals and the harmony impressed me the most, but Jon Anderson as the Front man defined<br />the band. Whilst the lyrics at some level were supposed to have that deeper meaning ( at least from TALES in the<br />notes I for that impression) I still got the main vibe from the virtuoso playing; basically, it was always very<br />visceral still, like in LONG DISTANCE RUN AROUND the bass going one way, and the guitar travelling in what I was<br />told by a keyboard friend was supposed to be a \\"contrapuntal\\" manner. And even as I read this, the track THE FISH<br />was an experience, not primarily an exercise in bass skills. I could relate to MOOD FOR A DAY as a work since it<br />spoke for itself. The band was, and I guess for me is, a whole experience; In what I knew as YES SONGS, the music<br />was separate and I enjoyed that as well, although I heard that a few ( 2 ) years later. At one stage I had \\"Mood\\"<br />down pat as a piece to play, but never quite got there as a piece to play, since people seemed to enjoy me playing<br />other things that spiked their juice ( so to speak). I still love this music, and it is very clear that the packaging was put to together by fans, although I don't know if all of the Rhino releases had notes written by<br />fans, or just by people with extensive verbal, even perhaps \\"prolix\\" skills. Suffice to say these re-issues are<br />re-Mastered brilliantly, and bring to mind my old Vinyl collection which I don't have all my original members of,<br />but I do have some.
B000056HUA|5.0|As I wrote on another site the thing about this DVD Audio that blows me away is we always read the review that says it's like \\"so and so is playing in your living room\\" and while a lot of the audiophile stuff I own comes close, this one comes the closest. At least for rock music. For jazz, I have a few that really create that impression. But this DVD A truly has Jim Morrison singing a few feet from me and I can see Ray Manzarek sitting in a chair hunched over his keyboard, Densmore in the back behind my system banging on drums and Krieger casually playing guitar while leaning against my bookcase. I know this may sound a bit dramatic, but it really comes that close.  Keep in mind I prefer to listen to 2 channel stereo so can't speak for the 5.1 surround on this but if you want to feel like The Doors are back together and playing in your living, you just get this.  Even if you've never been a huge Doors fan, this DVD-A will turn you into one.  Amazing in all ways.
B004TB6GUY|5.0|It's good to see Zakk stretch his wings and play in styles that prove the critics so very wrong.This album is new<br />and redone, as well as covers. It shows he can sing. Contrary to what the crazy critics say, Zakk's music is great<br />in variation, lyrical, and wonderful in content in all respects. For a man known for one style, I am glad he has<br />confounded the critics, and hopefully he has both extended his fan base as well as pleasing his existing group of<br />fans. This is great music, the re-do of his tracks, new music, and covers. flexible as ever, Zakk will be around<br />for a long while !! Thanks for all involved in his work for what he has done.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The best I've read in quite a long time!  Just the type of book you don't want to put down.  I haven't seen the TV series, but if it's half as good as the books I'll have to see it (and from what I heard, it's just as good as the books).
B007RI56NY|5.0|I wasn't really familiar with Train prior to buying this album.  I heard \\"Drive By\\" and thought it was catchy, and then I spotted the album on sale in the Amazon MP3 store...  I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did, and I would happily pay full retail in retrospect.  It is one of those rare albums that I enjoy listening to from start to finish, w/o skipping a track.  All of the songs are catchy, and it is a pretty uplifting listen overall.  I'm looking forward to checking out more of their music.

B00005OAES|5.0|Released in 1964, Bod Dylan's \\"The Times They are a Changin'\\" is perhaps one of the greatest albums that Dylan produced and possibly one of the greatest of the 20th century.  Words are inadequate to describe Dylan's work on this album.  I purchased the vinyl of this album and listened to it in glorious monophonic sound.  The first three tracks are beyond incredible and listening to them you realize that Dylan, only in his 20s, seems to have been around since the dawn of time.  His wisdom regarding war, poverty, injustice, depression and hope is timeless.  This work epitomizes the possibilities of the youth movement in America in the 1960s and the possibility, if one listened to Dylan carefully, that progressive and liberal change in America could be successful.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|To start with, I'm not particularly fond of it when artists throw in profanity simply because they can't think of any better way to say what they want to say.  I think Pink was a bit lazy in choosing to use the profanity, because it does significantly weaken her lyrics.  That said, though, there's no denying that this is a strong set of music, a group of songs that treads unique paths musically.  I like the diversity of sounds a lot, even if there isn't much new or original--she gives us a nice mix of styles and approaches so that the material doesn't grow stale.<br /><br />As with her other albums, Pink doesn't have an incredible vocal range, but one of her biggest strengths, in my eyes, is her ability to emote, to express her feelings with her voice.  And this she does without oversinging--screaming into the mic--and maintaining her vocal qualities while still reaching a high level of intensity.  When Pink wants to sound melancholy, she's able to do so; when she wants to sound happy, she can do that, too--and she mixes things up very well on this album.<br /><br />Pink is an adult singer.  She does throw in some juvenile language, but the jury's out whether she does so for the sake of her audience or for the sake of expression.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a 4 1/2-star album--strengthen the lyrics and take a few more risks with the music, and it's easily a five.  For now, I'll just round up, and it's good to know that I have another album that I'll never hesitate to put on when I feel like listening to good music.

B0058VW36U|1.0|so i am on my computer and looking at the apps i want and i did the 1 click download thing, it tells me to open the app to download, so i do but nothing is there. im pissed about all this hassle and want my money back if you app won't work damn amazon app store. anyway, i have played this game on my computer and loved it so i wanted it for my phone too.
0143038095|5.0|Amy always delivers the most heartfelt stories in a way every woman can relate to no matter what your nationality or background. So much of her stories could be placed directly into the background of my Scandinavian grandparents and parents without too much adjustment. Her stories always show me the commonality of all our lives no matter what race or local from which we come.

B005EGXTHG|5.0|Always skeptical with it being a follow book, but very glad i bought it thought it was just as good as the hunger games can't wait to read the final book to see what happens to Katniss and Petta . Worth a read if you have read the hunger games.
B002QS1O36|5.0|I just recently bought this movie and loved it it very good just wish they had Sarah bright man and Micheal Crawford in the movie instead of the other actors and actress even though there still great.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I saw the movie and thought I'd read the book, not disappointed it was brilliant couldn't put it down, would recommend to anyone go buy<br /> and read it, loose yourself in the Hunger games!
1881273873|5.0|This is a great book with good advice.  My daughters both read it also and it should help them make much wiser decisions.  It's not just \\"luck\\" to get the right one...it's knowing what to look for and sticking to the \\"standards\\".  Thanks to Steve Harvey!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|For a used set of discs, they arrived in great shape.  For us this is one of those movies that we can watch over and over again and we are enjoying the extras that made an already fantastic movie that much better. Thank you to the seller for having integrity and sending a used product in excellent condition.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game....very addicting!!! It can be very slow at times but its worth it. Wish you could buy more things with coins instead of diamonds though.
B005HWUBUK|4.0|Simply put, Mayer Hawthorne has created some of the catchiest music out there. His arrangements, borrowing and reusing the sounds and motions of motown, soul, and decades of r&b are fantastic. If you don't move when you listen to songs like \\"a long time\\" or \\"the walk\\", then you probably don't have a pulse. I heard one song and bought the vinyl. My flatmates heard me put it on and all came into my room asking what it was. Now they all have the record too. Listen to the samples, if you think this might be for you, it is.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|As I've stated on my previous reviews of Nerf guns, my nephew has over ten different Nerf guns that we play with on occasion, and I can honestly say that this particular Nerf gun has got the fastest rate of fire that we have ever seen. Also, the capacity of Nerf darts is a great value buy as this gun holds 144 darts. With the rapid fire ability comes a slight lack of accuracy, but with 144 darts to shoot off, my nephew doesn't seem to mind if it takes a few extra shots to hit a target. I'd definitely recommend it to any parents in the market for a cool gift for their kids that they will have a guaranteed good time playing with. This gun is very large though, so make sure you have plenty of closet space before you pick this one up for your child.
039472903X|4.0|Ogilvy is definitely the king of advertising. A must read for anyone though some examples may seem outdated. Wish our modern advertising folks read this book and then plunge into creating an ad.<br /><br />Thejendra<br />Author of The Mirage Peddlers
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Lee Child has been a fantastic author but unfortunately, of late, his story lines have been losing their sharpness and Reacher is becoming more of a drop out than a man of steel and integrity. Too many books are now being churned out with too little thought to the story. Come on Lee Child. Either resurrect the old Reacher or kill him off.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|It's a classic. The description of the fourth dimension, time, like the three other spatial dimensions is insightful. The author manages to be funny and tragic at the same time while describing some of the worst atrocities of the WWII.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|A great book and very funny. Men should definitely read this to relate to their women a little better! She covers every aspect of being a women in an entertaining way.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Unlike the author, I do not read other books about special forces so I cannot compare it to those. But for a person who is not an avid reader of such books, it is a very good read (and a very decent introduction) and really lets the reader identify with the people in the special forces.<br />It does not give away secrets which could compromise operations but the level of information is quite enough for you to feel what the author felt and know what his life was like along with a few missions.
B0087HT36U|4.0|fun
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great fun.  Take your favorite natural sounds; mix and match and relax.  I have a combination of rain and wind and waves that soothes the soul:-)

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Never has a book been so engrained into my spirit. I can see why the book was not written or published until 2002. We move as fast as our consciousness allows us to. Pi my heart is with you.
0062082353|5.0|Chris, thank you for writing this amazing book and sharing your story.  Most of all, thank you for your service to our Country.  I have to say, I too get annoyed when people don't tip their hat for our Country!
B000000OU0|3.0|The four new songs, Get Over It (the world dosen't owe you a living), Love Will Keep Us Alive (love song), The Girl From Yesterday (another love song) and Learn To Be Still (the title says it all) are all better than I expected, as I had not heard anything by The Eagles since the 1970s.<br />Now the live tracks, a massive favourite, Hotel California, on this occasion is not to my liking, being sung far to slow, loosing all it's bite and drive.<br />Wasted Time, Pretty Maids All In A Row and I Can't Tell You Why are OK (maybe because they are slower songs anyway) and to my mind The Last Resort and especially, Take It Easy, are excellent reditions.<br />I can't give more than 3 stars, much as I enjoy the 1970s Eagles recordings.
B0047SF41G|4.0|*** Spoiler alert *** The original Predator has become a watch-it-over-and-over classic. Predator 2 was a reasonably worthy successor but the later \\"Alien versus Predator\\" things, not so much. The \\"Most Dangerous Game\\" duel-between-masters aspect just wasn't there. This movie brings back the original idea, with humans of varying degrees of training and temperament - scary muscle guys, loony-tunes serial killers, top-class mercenary, Yakuza and IDF leader types, a guy who's survived being hunted for years, and one Hannibal Lecter wannabe - suddenly finding themselves on a planet perfectly adapted as a hunting environment. They're hunted by a small team of the alien SOB race and quickly realize that hunting the aliens is the only possible way to survive. Very tense, very complicated (which of the other humans can be trusted?) and lots of fun - more complex than the original and with great special effects. Not necessarily destined to be an all-time classic - but I'll definitely watch it again when it happens to be handy. IMHO this is the best of the sequels.
B000002G8H|3.0|I am a fan of Eric's 1970s recordings and Slowhand includes one of his greatest, the slow ballard Wonderful Tonight, in which the lyrics just flow with genuine affection.<br />Lay Down Sally is another good one, this time with a touch of reggae.<br />Some of the rest are not so much to my taste, although the instrumental Peaches And Diesel is OK.<br />Clapton fans who want not only his well known hits should give this one a try.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|This album is amazing. I think people didn't like it because it was a lot different from Funeral, but I thought it was in a good way. I bought Funeral first, then the Suburbs, and Neon Bible last. Honestly, it makes complete sense as a bridge from Funeral to the Suburbs. As a set, all of the albums remind me of the thought process people have as they are growing up. Funeral was all about staying true to yourself and expressing individuality, which I felt was exactly how I felt when I was in my younger teen years. Neon Bible is about when you are starting to see how screwed up everything in the world is, and the fear and anxiety that comes with that. And the only way I can describe the Suburbs is that painful, aching feeling you get when you realize you are not a kid anymore, and you long for the days when you would waste hours doing nothing but it was still amazing (in retrospect). Neon Bible is the perfect embodiment of the shock/horror you come to develop when you discover how the world really is, and the helpless feeling that comes along with it. It is so good. I really can't say any more than that.
B0073COMKW|5.0|This bulb has a very nice, warm look to it. description says that it will replace a 60W DOWNLIGHT. That is pretty much correct.

B008MBXFEM|5.0|As usual, Hans Zimmer creates an incredible experience with this Dark Knight score. I always look forward to sampling anything that he composes.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I would go on this app every day (not exaggerating) but for some reason I cant even watch videos or download anything be it video, mp3, or aac (at least I think its aac) So I deleted it in hopes I could re download it, but now it wont download please fix this if you can!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|ok so i am a single mom who gets home from work at 8 and leaves at 6am.  Needless to say I started reading this book and yes I had to stay up to 3 am to finish.  I just couldn't put it down.  It was such a fun read!  Can't wait for the next one!
B008NEE966|5.0|I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith as a teenager many years ago.  I went on to read her other novels as well.  I got the audiobook for my husband and I to listen to on a trip.  I still love it.  I think I missed some of the underlying messages when I read it when I was young, and I don't think I really agree with Ms. Smith's world view, her political and theological ideology.  But I love her rather poetic writing style, and the way the characters are so REAL!  The reader on this audio version is excellent as well.  Everyone should read this book!
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Amazing how Aimee has been so consistent over the years with such great songs.  Both lyrically and musically.  She's fantastic.  And if you check out the new music videos she's made for Charmer, you'll see her having more fun than ever. (In spite of the dreadful music business...) Charmer - video with Laura Linney is a classic, and Labrador - a spoof on the video for Voices Carry is hilarious.  Early favorites for me are Crazytown, Living a Lie, Soon Enough and Gumby.  All are very radio friendly and so much better than what's out there today.  Go and see her when she plays in your town!  Highly recommend Charmer.  Buy it!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game has totally awesome graphics and story line. I just finished playing and I can't wait to play number two. Keep these cool games coming please.

B001IF252M|5.0|\\"Yes it works in the Thunderbolt port.\\"  I was surprised our new iMacs did not have a display port. so after much reading, I decided the Thunderbolt port really was multifunctional.  I ordered this adapter, plugged it in to a Thunderbolt port, and it worked beautifully.
0525952926|3.0|it's been many months since I read the first book, and I resent the blithe assumption that readers remember the great many characters and their respective history. True, the book is already long, and even the shortest of reminders would have made it longer still, however it is frustrating at time to meet characters one only vaguely remembers.  Once you get over it, it appears more  and more as if the personal history of the characters takes second place to historical events. Worse, they all just \\"happen\\" to be there or take part in all major events.  One character involved with the atomic bomb in America, another with the Russian bomb. I could go on...The political bias is very strong too.  In short, it is extremely hard to get involved since there is no in-depth analysis and characters appear shallow.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This book comes recommended 'after 50 shades', that's a joke.  The characters are immature, the writing is okay, but I had no sympathy or concern for any of the characters.  I would NOT recommend this book to anyone, certainly not to anyone who enjoyed '50 Shades' because there's no comparison at all.  It's a romance, that's about where the likeness stops.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Pinterest was fine until today when I got the message to upgrade. Since then..all it does is force close. Ugh! I wish I. could get the un-upgraded version back! So so very unhappiest!
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I used to love this app. but recently it hasn't been playing my music and videos. it has been crashing multiple times. Plus the multiple porn ads aren't very enjoyable... (meaning I don't like seeing them every time I click on the app.)
B0087HT36U|2.0|This is a bad port of what appears to be a decent iPhone game.  does not work at all on jelly bean. On other android devices, many of the levels are buggy at best, several are completely unplayable.  If I had paid for this game, I would demand a refund.
B000FBJF3M|4.0|Entertaining but not engaging.  I would have liked to be a little more descriptive.  I started reading, dropped and then out of discipline I picked it up and finished it.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|its not the best racing game but has potential. its fast passed and is simaler to Mario Cart. 4 stars. not too bad.
B000094HLA|5.0|Just bought this CD from Amazon UK (cheaper delivery to Brazil when compared with Amazon USA). I can say that this is another great reading of this Bach's masterpiece. Andras Schiff is perfect for this classical piece. Really recommended this ECM CD.
0451232577|3.0|I'd like to start this review by stating that I bought this book in an airport so I'd have something during 12 hours of travel. I had no idea who Ken Follett was, but I love history, I studied it as an undergrad, and so I was interested in a novel that took the reader back to World War I and discussed the events through characters of several different nationalities.<br /><br />At first, I thought the writing style was slow and tedious (after all, the book is, like, 800 pages long); however, it is entertaining enough to where I could just read it and forget about the slowness. He tries to portray the characters realistically, each with their own flaws and distinct personalities. What I find most interesting is seeing the major battles and events presented through the eyes of its characters.<br /><br />There's two things that I didn't like about the book: the presentation of religion and the characters themselves. To address my first point, I think he is unfair towards religion. The few religious characters in the book are presented as arrogant and prideful at best, and criminals and pedophiles at worst. I was especially dismayed when Fallett writes about a peace proposal in 1916 as being presented by the Germans through Woodrow Wilson. The peace proposal during this time came from Austria-Hungary because its leader, Emperor Charles was a devout Catholic who saw the war as an affront to God (these efforts were a major reason why Pope John Paul II beatified him). Of course, I was not surprised when Follett choose to ignore this historical fact because of his treatment of religion earlier in the book.<br /><br />Lastly, I didn't really like the characters themselves. Although Follett tries to make the characters realistic, he takes them from fringe elements of society. They are either elites or people called \\"radicals\\" such as socialists and feminists. None of the main characters are \\"normal\\" and the few \\"normal\\" characters that do show up are presented as dimwitted orstupid, which was very disappointing.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Dallas and Melissa are both wonderful presenters and motivators. They are smart enough to know and personable enough to teach all of the concepts in their book. Keep up the good work, Whole9.
B00000251N|5.0|I had this album on the original vinyl,but had lost it over the years. I recently found my copy of the book by Richard Bach and that made me remember how much I loved the album.<br />The music is just as wonderful as I had remembered . Neil Diamond has always been a favorite of mine and his voice is Jonathan to me.

B004EJUMT2|4.0|I have been desperately trying to buy Ghost's music to see how it is and once I did It blew my mind ultra satanic metal from Sweden it totally made an impression on me. They remind me of old Mercyful Fate, Blue Oyster Cult, and Pentagram with their dark and evil music and image. Most people do not like Ghost for whatever reason but these guys are part of metal's new breed of bands coming out, with a lot of focus on theatrics and satanic lyrics Ghost delivers the good stuff. Songs like Satan Prayer, Elizabeth , Stand By Him, Prime Mover, and Ritual make it clear to me that Ghost is an amazing force to be reconed with.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I think this CD is one of their best. The recording is stunning as usual. These guys are the best at what the do,make beautiful music.

0345803485|3.0|Obviously this is fiction and where would we be without the imagination of Authors. I understand that not everyone appreciates the expression of a 22 year old girl blushing 10 different shades in every page, but as a women that ha fallen in love that's exactly how you feel.<br /><br />Their is no doubt that Christian Gray is a made up character, but if you asked a woman how she felt when she fell in love even if it was the wrong guy she would express her self just like a 16year girl.<br /><br />Why is it so hard for some to understand that as a woman you can look at a guy and get horny ....Some of the reviewer's on here my lack a libido and have probably only done vanilla.<br />The sex is over the top, but in real life you do have sex addicts from both genders and it would be something hard for some of us to understand.  I agree that the characters lack development and this will be hard for some readers specially if they lack imagination.<br />The author only shows a glimpse into Christians past and the reason for his sadist tendency and the struggle for his control. Book 1-2 could have been done in one book. Book 3 is very slow and all the action takes place at the end.<br />I also have to respond to one of the reviews stating they find the sex comical.<br /><br />I sense that who ever wrote the review he/she lack the confidence in their body & skill, but keep it vanilla since that is all you can handle..
B008MG1E4A|1.0|The writer, who is aso the main character in the book is an opportunistic and despicable person. His description of the various events around his experiences as a Navy Seal plus the politically oriented remarks lacking in inteligence and sense of strategy, makes even worse the book. I have no idea if what he did is legal, but in any event the disclosure of all of these informations is out of character with the confidentiality one expect from a navy seal involved in such sensitive matters.

B004XZR63M|4.0|An eye opener to anyone who has grown up in a poor household. Principles make a lot of sense and definitely worth the read if you have the initiative to mend your spending habits.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This is a wonderfully written, well acted story.  It's probably aimed at those of us with some gray.  I found it to be an encouraging reminder that life isn't over until it's over.  In fact I was so buoyed it by it that I went and decided to take art lessons, something I've always wanted to do.  \\"It's all good in the end and if it isn't good then it's not the end.\\"  I thought it was a rare life-affirming story, a story that reminds us any time is a good time to live, a positive message in a society that wants to throw us away when we're fifty.<br />You can't go wrong with a cast like this and I consider India itself to be a character.  It's a reminder that we pay a price for 'advancement' and part of that blind acceptance of progress is that we lose something of the flavor of life in doing so.
0307346609|5.0|World War Z is a work of fiction which records the stories of survivors of the zombie apocalypse from all over the world, and from all walks of life. Some from mothers and sons, others from soldiers and government officials. This book is told in an interview-style narrative. The author acts as interviewer, traveling around the world, and seeking answers about the virus. He inquires into why and how the virus was developed, and how far in advanced the government knew about it. This book quickly gained a spot on my top 5 shelf because of the style it is written in. It's completely unique, but also very smart. This isn't another zombie book about a group surviving the apocalypse. This is a great prose on the after effects of war, and human nature. I would recommend this book to zombie enthusiasts and regular folk alike. It's fast paced enough not to lose your attention, and smart enough to get you wrapped up in right away.
B005CYLSW8|5.0|Riccardo Chailly knows how to capture his audience. First he takes us along at a tempi that, at times, leaves one rather breathless. It is irresistable listening. Then there is the quality of the sound. Simply outstanding.Certainly there have been interpretations that are much more sedate which will appeal to the laid back. But for those who relish excitement this is the set for you.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best films ever, I'll for sure buy the collectors edition after the brief case deal gets worked out.  For those complaining about the dvd not having what the blu ray does, well stop being cheap and buy a blu ray player.  Get up to date.  Blu ray players cost around 100 bucks.  Stop buying crappy dvds and buy a blu ray player.  Dont give negative feedback because you can't afford a blu ray player.  Dvd is old crap that I can't even believe they stil make dvds.
1405853115|1.0|This book gives only a cursory description of second language learning methodologies and applications.<br />It glosses over much of the important background required to actually understand and implement the<br />information used, it is a very superficial description of the information presented.<br /><br />If you really are interested:<br />Second Language Learning Theories by Mitchell and Myles<br />is a great book with thoroughly explains the information and gives you a real insight into the various ways of teaching a second language,<br />it can be painfully dry sometimes, but unlike The Practice of Teaching English, it contains all of the relevant information.
B008966SIU|5.0|Continued progression for one of the best bands in the business today.  It's almost unreal that these guys can continue to write a better and better record with each release.  One would have though Veckatimest would have been their critically acclaimed peak, but they have topped it with Shields.  A concise, \\"all killer no filler\\" record, this is sure to be considered for album of the year in many circles.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

They waste about the first 15 minutes explaining what has happened in the past four movies. REALLY?! You think people are going to show up that DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?!!!! Give the audience some credit.  For me, that's saying A LOT. I have been in love with Resident Evil since this first time I played #1 on my playstation. The game was as groundbreaking for zombies as Silent Hill was for demon-worshipers.  There's lots of Mila-is-such-a-badass shots, fighting, slow motion, etc. (I later found out the director is her husband. It explains much) There's a bunch of Michelle-is-so-mean-and-uncaring dialogue, fighting, etc. You'll get to see a lot of previous characters die again. Sometimes twice. The Red Queen will give away all the surprises through out the movie. Wesker returns for more wax-like acting and bad-guy posturing. (was he CGI? Cause he looked very CGI)  Honestly, they should have saved this part as a game, released it, then continued the movie where the game leaves off. THAT would have been awesome, and pulled the audience right in. (well, us gamers anyway.)  Where the very first Resident Evil movie succeeded enormously, quite a feat when the audience already know what was going on, the last four have steadily lowered the bar over-and-over. Time to shoot this franchise in the head.
B007TMON8M|5.0|One of the more enjoyable physics based games, with lots of variety and challenges. This will keep you entertained for a long time. Hoping for more levels soon. GSII.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I just cannot comprehend how a band can make 5 albums in a row without a single song that wouldn't qualify as great...
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app really helped me to know how how much time I have left to use my kindle. I also like to know when my battery gets to a certain percentage. I highly recommend this app.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I think the book is pretty good.  He takes you back into his history with the Seals far enough to get an idea what it takes to become a Seal and then gives you some depth of what some of the missions involve.  All of this leads up to the mission to find and take out UBL.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The graphics are nice, the commands are easy, and the difficulty goes anywhere from easy to omg! It's a fun game of luck and strategy.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|This movie is more fun and more deep that you'd think. In fun, it it almost living up to the first movie which can hardly be topped, of course. But it adds some serious aspects to the notorious sequence of low-level jokes which has been typical for the American Pie series. And this actually makes the movie a really good one, telling a surprising story about friendship and change.
B004UID2LC|4.0|they fix this build.  It keeps saying the connection is weak, and I'm practically next to my wifi adapter.  When its good, its good.  When its bad, its bad.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I must applaud the efforts of Mark Owen. In this day and age, serving our country through the armed forces is quite dangerous. I like the way his story is factual and not intended for hype. You really get a sense for the struggles these men and women face serving overseas. Much should be said about how these individuals are great problem solvers and are trained accordingly. I would highly recommend reading this book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a true story that needed to be told.<br />The way the Author wrote was from a special place.<br />He was a humble, desciplined, unselfish human being.<br />Our country is Blessed with having our militay.<br />To our Navy Seals a Thank You !!<br />God Bless America

1401229921|5.0|Truly one of my favorite artists, Jim Lee's work is amazing.  I swear the story must be good, but I've always been one of those guys who just likes the pictures. :)
0062060562|5.0|I found this book utterly gripping. The author has managed to minimise the repetition - no mean feat given that the main character forgets everything every time she wakes up.<br /><br />The story is revealed to the reader and the main character bit by bit. It builds to a superb ending and I read it over 3 days because it was so enthralling.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like psychological thrillers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game I really enjoyed it. it was soo much fun. I hope they come out with more games. I love it alot.
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|Look I'm no prude by far. But I was looking for something with an intriguing plot on par with Breaking Bad. And WOW! This show is literally a tiny bit of story, then soft core porn, then story, more porn, story, more porn and repeat. If you're 18 and under, or a desprit virgin in general, this show is for you.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very useful do not hesitate to download. tells you how long it js going to take to charge and many other information.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|A most interesting account of a US Marine SEAL's military career which culminates with his participation in the almost impossible mission to kill the Al Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden in his hideout at Abottabad, Pakistan. A large portion of the book describes the making of this SEAL and only toward the end of the book does one start to read about the actual Osama Bin Laden mission. The reverse would have been more interesting to me since I felt a bit cheated in the way the author chose to write this book.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app its really cool edeting get this app if you like drawing :) get it and you will have fun
0316066524|4.0|I feel like there's been so much written about this book, that it almost seems impossible to try to add anything new to this discussion.  However, I will try to lay out reasons to buy/not buy this book as well as a few things people might want to know before jumping into this kind of commitment.  INFINITE JEST isn't for everyone, and I don't mean that in a condescending or patronizing way: it will certainly appeal to some people's sensibilities much more than others.<br /><br />###Here's What You Need to Know###<br />David Foster Wallace's INFINITE JEST is a postmodern novel with a premodern message.  Wallace, who railed against irony, wanted to be sincere in his writing.  So while this book does contain many postmodern conventions, its ideas about humanity aren't postmodern at all.  I think many people were disappointed that the book is \\"about addiction, and that's all you need to know,\\" but there is much more to this book, and there's much more that Wallace has to say.  Some of these messages are delivered with a heavy hand, and that's fine: Wallace wanted to be sincere, and he wouldn't want to dull his insights by distancing himself from them via irony or whatever else.<br /><br />This book is indeed incredibly long.  INFINITE JEST is notoriously known for being a long book - it's just shy of 1100 pages.  Stephen King's THE STAND (uncut edition) and George R.R. Martin's STORM OF SWORDS are longer this, but I was able to clear those books much quicker than David Foster Wallace's second novel.  I'm a very slow reader, and I was able to read INFINITE JEST in about two months, without taking into account the time I spent reading two shorter novels by different authors.<br /><br />This book is indeed incredibly verbose.  As a way to rage against the rising popularity of minimalist writing in the 1980's, Wallace found himself moving towards a brand of writing that captured everything: every thought, every action, every detail.  His maximalist writing can be hard to get through at time: there's an extended passage detailing a tennis academy's design that seems to go on forever.  The discussion of an invented game that involves intermediate calculus to keep score reaches across dozens of pages.  Wallace sought to capture everything.<br /><br />Everything you heard about the endnotes is true.  The narration of the book is frequented interrupted with endnotes (different from footnotes), some of which span a dozen pages and contain their own endnotes.  These asides are not optional: plot details are frequently hinted at or exposed in these interludes.<br /><br />READ THIS ON KINDLE IF YOU CAN.  I want to stress this point: reading INFINITE JEST is much easier on an eReader for a few reasons.  With Kindle, the hassle of flipping back to the endnotes is a burden made much lighter.  Each note is hyperlinked to its corresponding section to the back.  It's also really easy to highlight, bookmark, make notes of certain areas to revisit if you need.  Some important plot elements are given only once in passing, so marking these areas is helpful, and Kindle makes the task really simple.  The weight of this mammoth book is also erased with the electronic copy.  There are two complaints about the Kindle version however: 1) it's not a real book, and I prefer handling most books (I think we all kind of do, right?) and 2) if you close the eReader while you are in the endnotes, your Kindle will recognize that page as being the further point you've read to.  Remedying this situation isn't hard; you'll just need to log onto Amazon and clear your furthest-page-read, but it is a bit annoying.<br /><br />###Here's Why You Should Buy This Book###<br />Some of the passages in this novel rank among my favorite all-time sections of writing.  While Wallace can be verbose, it can lead to some of the most inventive and poetic turns of phrase.  I found myself going back and re-reading many moments as soon as I finished them and highlighting them for later use (Irarely ever do this).<br /><br />This book is funny, sad, smart, and silly.  INFINITE JEST really runs the gamut in terms of emotions that it evokes.  I've seen many readers talk about how funny it is, and others that focus on how tragic it is.  There are moments in this book that I still reflect on and laugh out loud.  There are moments that, when I think about them, make me want to cry.  There are even moments in this that give me the goosebumps imagining how horrifying they would be.<br /><br />INFINITE JEST is filled with tons of ideas and tons of characters.  Readers will spend a lot of time with the characters here, and almost all of them are interesting.  Some of them are fun, and some of them are despicable.  Mario Incandenza ranks among one of my favorite characters in literature.  Additionally, this book is full of ideas about addiction, entertainment, society, family, imperialism, Quebec separatism, and tennis.  There's a lot of great insight spread out across the novel's length.  There's not a ton of plotting to INFINITE JEST, but it's alright: these characters are often compelling enough that readers will want to spend their time with them.<br /><br />It seems that half of the reason to read INFINITE JEST lies merely in the act of doing it.  Most people bail on the book midway through, so finishing the novel is seen as a sort of accomplishment in some circles.<br /><br />###Here's Why You Should Pass on This Book###<br />This book is too long.  It surprised me to learn that INFINITE JEST had an editor and that sections of the book were excised.  There are some stretches where not much seems to happen and no new insights are made.  Most books leave me wanting the ending to go on and on forever, but there were times where I was just ready for this novel to be over (strangely enough, not at the ending though).<br /><br />INFINITE JEST is wildly inconsistent.  It probably comes with the territory of maximalist writing, but while some passages of writing are fantastic, some passages are equally dull.  While I loved the book, I think it would be hard to argue that this novel is a solid, consistent work.  Additionally, the novel frequently jumps (apropos of nothing) to different characters and different times and different settings.  The narrative might be dealing with Hal Incandenza at a Boston tennis academy in the future only to suddenly (with, granted a line break) focus on a glimpse of his father in the 1970's.  Even more additionally, the writing style changes frequently.<br /><br />The use of styles can be jarring.  I ended up liking this point, but I feel that I may be in the minority on this.  Early in the book, an essay written by one of the characters (in high school) is recounted in full.  Later, we are treated to stream-of-consciousness via a character we are not familiar with.  Later, there are dozens of pages with nothing but dialog (literally, not figuratively), and some passages that are completely without dialog.<br /><br />There's not much plot here.  I haven't talked much about the plot in the above content because there's just not that much to talk about.  The premise is: a filmmaker created a video that is so enjoyable, people can't turn away from it or think about anything else.  Most of this book focuses in on its settings and characters to make its points.<br /><br />###Overall... ###<br />Overall, I gotta say, even for all of its flaws, I really enjoyed INFINITE JEST.  Some of the reviewers that rated this book poorly have good points to make, and I would recommend reading these reviews before making the plunge on buying this book.  At the end of the day though, if you enjoy postmodern fiction, INFINITE JEST is definitely an experience worth trying.rarely ever do this).<br /><br />This book is funny, sad, smart, and silly.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|While reading this book, I found it at times to be hard to follow and a difficult read.  However, it was refreshingly HONEST and without any pretenses other than to set the record straight.  The Author described the Mental Attitude and Physical requirements necessary to become a Special Operator, in the US Navy, he showed what it takes to be a Winner!  While each Operator in the US Military (Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine - and yes, the Coast Guard) comes from different backgrounds they all have that quality which makes them effective in the environment in which they can and do work.  The Author brings this out and shows one person's experience in doing a difficult job, and the training it takes to do it well.  While the Author has left Volume's of Information out, of what it takes to be an Operator - the book does convey the Brotherhood necessary to be successful in the world of Special Operations.  Having \\"been there/done that\\" (in a different branch of the service) it is refreshing to see Honesty being presented - where normally the Politico's put their own particular \\"SPIN DOCTORING\\" on things they should keep quiet.  The Author set the record straight, where the POLITICIANS took the credit for something they should keep their traps shut on/about.
B003L8EX0G|5.0|...another one...it really gets a bit annoying, doesn' t it?! - all of these people who want to become musicians and  performers...we should only have the very true ones, i.e. the best of the rest. And - she seems to be the one - who can express oneself at the age of 16 like this deserves to rise up to the heaven of legends...Hold it, hold it - not quite so fast! We shall see what the future brings. One major reason for the flood of artists coming on the scene is - or more 2 major reasons are: the loss of boundaries between genres and regions - anyone from anywhere can do anything tomorrow...and the growing population. Out of 5b there is better chance to get talents to break through than there is out of a pool of 3b. Bottom line after all of this jibberish: she is born to do just that it sounds and we may as well hear a lot more of her in the future but she will have to proof that she can show character when growing up.

B007SGM084|5.0|A young innocent woman meets and is extremely attracted to a little older man who has vast experience in all things sexual and how to please a woman.  As their relationship progresses, Anastasia is intrigued by Christian's ability to go from being extremely tender to extremely irate in a second's time. These books are so enjoyable that you hate to put them down. When you absolutely must interrupt your reading, you're anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.  As you are reading Book III, you can't help but feel unhappy with the knowledge that once you've read all of it, THERE IS NO MORE! Once I had finished Book III, I felt compelled to go back and find my favorite parts in the books and read them over and over again.  The sexual encounters are very graphic, so these books should be Adult Reading Only.

B009329ZF2|4.0|...in the genre of hostile-alien-earth-invasion flicks, this one ranks in the top five...!!...the special effects were top-notch and the futuristic alien weaponry was very believable and not as far-fetched as most Hollywood productions go...my ONLY complaint was the very little screen time that was afforded Liam Neesom, as he is a truly powerful screen presence, and I thought he'd have a bigger role defending us from the newest crop of humanoid oppressors.<br /><br />GREAT flick...!!!

B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked Catching Fire but I didn't fine it as spell-binding as Hunger Games.  I thought it lacked the tension and the depth of the original book.  But, it had a dangling ending that left me hanging enough that I bought the third book.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quick, exciting read.

B009AJDDQU|4.0|I'm a die hard fan of Scott's Alien (and Aliens).  When I heard David Lindelof (of the TV show Lost) was chosen to finish the script I admittedly cringed a little.  He's a superb writer but I am not always a fan of his style.<br /><br />I understand the criticisms lodged at the movie/writers/actors and I don't think they are all unwarranted.  O'Bannon's script for Alien was so tight.  It was his baby and it came long before Scott and Giger came aboard for the project. Plus, the acting was flawless.<br /><br />Scott and Lindelof said repeatedly that this was NOT a prequel to Alien.  Scott wanted to take the motifs/themes and go in a different direction.  I think the theme was lofty (the origins of humanity) and fell flat with some viewers.  The plot twists and subplots were difficult to accept or believe at times.  You have to understand that's Lindelhof's approach, not the absence of any creativity per se.<br />There are some intelligent interpretations of the film on youtube worth watching.<br /><br />Still, if you are an Alien filmology fan, this is a must.  I think we will learn to like the film more over time.  Besides, what else do we have to rent?  Space Cowboys?
B0087HT36U|5.0|love this game really addicting and time consuming I have played almost non stop since I got it some puzzles are really difficult and make you think and saving the peasants adds a whole new level difficulty and fun

B00563M11M|5.0|Discworld books starring Sam Vimes, Commander Vimes, His Grave the Duke of Ankh Morpork, Sam Vimes the Blackboard Monitor or any other person in that select club that includes the father of young Sam and husband of the formidable Lady Sybil are always good and I enjoy them hugely. This one is, again, better than the last one. Because this one gives us insides to Sam Vimes and his family and tells about Detective Sam instead of Captain Sam Vimes. This book is yet another great installment of the Discworld Series of which we fans can't get enough. And if I have the choice of books about that wonderful world I'd prefer them to be about Sam Vimes and friends, no doubt about it. Sir Pratchett has turned out yet another page turner that entertains from title page to footnotes!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Slammed was a great read and it,was also an easy read. Enjoyed this one and the second one!!! I also really loved the poetry in it

B009329ZF2|5.0|It's propaganda. It's cheesy. It's loud, stupid and typical tripe.  I loved it.  After fighting wars against Dirt Farmers with loaded pet goats, it's nice to dream about a victorious battle against a technologically superior foe who is waging a war of aggression...only in Hollywood baby, only in Hollywood. :=P
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|having a lot of fun just wish i could trade coins up after a certain amount for cash<br />the game is close to what i played as a kid just better graphics
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book was ok. I was told by a Seal who was there that the author was not even there.  I don't know if that is true or not!  The story was interesting and easy reading.  I was looking for the secret info but didn't read anything that I didn't know.

0525953728|1.0|I found this book in the seat pocket of an airplane going from Chicago to Oakland.  Since I had only a newspaper for a four hour flight, I thought I would give it a try.  By the time I had finished chapter three, I knew that Matt Bissonnette really liked to believe he was very important.  I only read eight chapters and that was enough for me and I'm happy I didn't have to pay anything for this elementary written book.  Seals have a reputation of being quiet, intelligent, highly motivated and unassuming.  It becomes very apparent early in the book that Matt has a need to be the center of attention regarding his practical jokes.<br />  Matt claims the book is not about him, but about all those who took part in the raid from the planning of the intel to those on his team.  Why would he feel the need to go public with such a highly sensitive mission?  I would say that Matt is a self-aggrandizing fool who has a deep-seated need to be recognized as some sort of iconic hero.  I have no idea if what he wrote was classified but I do know that one never speaks out publicly when sworn to an oath.  I equate this to being very close to treason.  I know that many will say this is a free speech issue and he is no longer in uniform, however, hopefully one day Matt will stop and think about this selfish act he has committed and think about that oath he took to remain quiet about any and all operations.<br />  Matt could of written a book on something like how the intel community track OBL's courier to Abbottobad through phone conversations with Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's relatives back in Kuwait.  Then how the Seals planned the operation and left it at that.  The only hero that should be mentioned in this story is that of Fran Townsend who was one of the analyst that spent many years piecing together bits of information that led to the discover of OBL's courier.  This set the plan into motion to finally bring OBL to justice by finding out the name of OBL's courier and then tracking himto that compound in Abbottobad, Pakistan.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|When I went to watch this movie in the cinema, It was only because nothing at time I was free was running that was even remotely interesting. So me and my friend went to watch it and even though I have seen the trailers for the movie and ad's etc I just was not intrigued about it and though this movie was going to be a one of those movies you rent to watch once.<br />But BOY was I wrong, turns out that this movie was in my opinion advertised extremely badly and extremely badly is softly said.<br /><br />When my friend and I went in to watch the movie, we were sucked in to the whole world of the film (MARS)from the minute it started running, the creators of AVATAR need to be taking notes as far as the story in the film is concerned because it was VERY well made, there's MORE than enough action and the effects are through the whole movie and are of TOP QUALITY. If I had to sum up the movie in as short and quick as possible while giving examples of similar movies, think of JOHN CARTER as a cross between AVATAR and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time<br /><br />Rating: 10/10 !!<br /><br />The movie pulls you in from beginning to the very end and leaves you wanting for more ( in a VERY good way )<br /><br />BY FAR one of THE best Sci-Fi/Fantasy movie I've ever seen, if not THE best story wise. And believe me when I say this... The amount of movies I have watched is RIDICULOUS... 50x above the average person.<br /><br />Don't hesitate and BUY THIS MOVIE because you will NOT regret it as you will be WATCHING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Moneyball was a great movie about baseball, but from a fresh perspective. Really it was about money, and how money impacts the game and how you could use a different approach to picking players that would overcome the disadvantage of having less money then other clubs, like The Yankees.<br /><br />Brad Pitt gave a great performance as General Manager of the under financed Oakland A's, Billy Beane. He passed up a full scholarship to Stanford for a career as a player in Major League Baseball, but it didn't work out and throughput the film pivotal moments are illuminated by flashbacks of his dashed hopes. Pitt conveys the frustrations and determination of Beane, a true maverick trying to cut against the grain of Major League Baseball. I rank this performance right up there with Fight Club for Mr. Pitt.<br /><br />While trying to bag some players from the Cleveland Indians Billy Beane spots a talented analyst, a composite character named Peter Brand. The Cleveland management doesn't appreciate the young firebrand's ideas, but Beane knows talent when he sees it. He asks if perhaps he is someone's nephew, but finds that it is Brand's first job, not only in baseball, but his very first job of any sort since graduating from Yale with a degree in Economics. Jonah Hill was nominated for a well deserved supporting actor Oscar for his performance--an understated, dead pan performance that is still quite funny, but doesn't undercut the drama.<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman blended into his role as A's coach Art Howe so well that I didn't even recognize him. Also notable was Kerris Dorsey as Billy's daughter Casey Beane. I recognized her from the TV drama Brothers  & Sisters. Finally, Chris Pratt, from TV comedy Parks & Recreation, was outstanding in his field as Scott Hatteberg, one of the underrated players, chosen for his ability to get on base--even if he has to walk to get there. All the supporting cast rang very true, like it was a documentary but with better lighting.<br /><br />The movie grabbed me right from the beginning and wouldn't let go, even though I am not really much of a baseball fan. Like the people it depicts, this film was a real game changer. It was the first baseball film to be nominated for best picture since Field of Dreams 22 years ago.br /><br />The movie grabbed me right from the beginning and wouldn't let go, even though I am not really much of a baseball fan.

B007UXSPK2|5.0|Total escapism from any routine life.  High quality production values, superb performances and a story worth telling. That's what hoped for... that's what I got.  It is a superb bookend for the three MI that preceded it.<br />That scene on the hotel is one stands alone as a scoped out scenario to keep you on the edge of whatever.  Tom Cruise and his supporting cast are at the top of their game. Marvelous movie.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|While the story left a little bit to be desired here and there, overall, the latest Mission Impossible is very entertaining.  The scenery is great wherever the agents must travel, the action is non-stop, and the technology is all very cool.  I went in expecting the Mission Impossible series to end with a dud but I'm more hooked than ever now.
B0087HT36U|5.0|fun cheap and slightly easy game and a slightly different take on angry birds. definitely worth picking up for a dollar.
0439023513|4.0|I loved the first, second, and third but the third lacked emotion. So many people died and there was no emotion!<br /><br />EXAMPLE: I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER IT ALL BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I READ IT!<br /><br />And as I look down at the ground, I see Finnik's head being twisted off.<br /><br /> I call out for Prim and as I do so, a bomb falls and everything goes blank.<br /><br />But my Mom always say \\"Auther try way harder in their first book than the others.\\"
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a \\"S H\\" read. All the military and ex-military will understand that \\"phonetic lingo. The author pulls no punches and tells it like it was. No frills, no hype; all matter-of-fact info on some of the important missions he has participated in. He stresses the teamwork of our nation's finest, most competent fighters and their training. He does not divulge any info detrimental to national security in spite of all the BS from the White House. He tells it like it was without embellishment to soften the harsh realty of war.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|It was a good movie. The picture quality was good yet it didnt begin to compare to the book. They left a lot of detail out but thats commen with books turned into movies. But the movie was okay.
B002U1D400|5.0|A great album. The only place to find better versions of any of these tracks is Bowie at the Beeb. Check out that collection if you are a Bowie fan.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|Any Beatles fan would love this movie. The picture is really clear and also i really like how the music and the scenes blend in.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|$25.26 for the e-version of a book that sells for $21.00 in hardcover?  The Chicago Cubs will win the World Series, or hell will freeze over (whichever comes first)before I will pay such s rip-off, extortionate, unconscionable, price.  I know that Amazon did not set the price, but I hope that Amazon will let the publisher know how I, and other POTENTIAL customers feel.  I would write the publisher myself, but the letter would have to be printed on asbestos!
B0087HT36U|3.0|Not bad. some levels make you think a little. No need to make IAP if you take a moment to use your brain. Kind of a mix between Angry Birds and Fragger.
0307744434|5.0|So I don't often give 5 star ratings for books.  I'm a bit picky about when I say I 'love' something instead of just 'like' it.  Look at my rating above and you will that I loved this book.<br /><br />The writing style is almost like a series of vignettes.  Small chapters that each contain a small segment of time with a certain group of characters.  At first, as you are learning who the main characters are, it can be a bit disconcerting with all the small jumps back and forth.  However, as the story evolves, the challenge of the 'game' with the Circus as a venue, and the disparate stories all begin to mold together.<br /><br />It is almost like the author took 100s of little bits of a story and gradually brought them together.  I loved how it all unfolded before me.  So in some aspects, that makes a book a bit predictable and there were some parts I had guessed hundreds of pages before.  Then there were the really, really nice surprises like where Celia and Marco meet for the first time, the different ways that magic are portrayed, the clever way that Hector Bowen 'dies'.  All these wonderful tidbits kept me wanting more.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that is simple, straight-forward, uses the least amount of the English language to portray an idea - you will probably hate this book.  However, if you enjoy detailed descriptions written as wonderful prose that completely transport you to a place in time, you will love this book.  I'm obviously of the latter category.<br /><br />Overall - easily the best all-around book I've read this year.  Wonderful prose, wonderful imaginative plot twists, and memorable characters.  Worthy of all the praise it is getting.
0425263908|5.0|This is an excellent book - easy to read.  Looking forward to the next book in the series.  If you enjoyed Shades of Grey, this one is equally as good without all the x-rated language.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its. an okay game welll okay I like the many games o o o o o p o o o o o
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was so interesting I just couldn't put it down. You simply want to know what's going to happen next.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I like this movie. I like all the Mission Impossible movies. If you want to see some cool gadgets, hot girls, and hotter cars, then this is the movie for you. It's more like a \\"guy movie\\"...just action, guns, explosions...it's exactly what you expect it to be.
B001200OFS|5.0|I'm a big Nickelback fan and this is one of my favorites! I have all of the CDs and love a majority of the songs!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|If indeed a world-wide 'collapse' were to happen, this excellent movie gives us the best look at our future of survival.It isn't until almost the end of the movie that we understand Eli's daring pilgrimage to the west coast: a nuclear holocaust occurred, Bibles were burned and God was taken out of our endless days of suffering.Alas,hidden inside Eli's backpack is the answer to man's salvation.Great script and acting. The drama will keep the viewer spell bound.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I purchased this book 3 days ago and already completed Chest & Abs and Back workouts.<br />Pros:<br />- Easy to read and understand for advance beginners.<br />- Provides enough information on nutrition and exercises.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Lack of illustrations for ALL exercises.<br />- Hard to follow meal plans if you live in Vietnam due to limited amount of western food on the market.<br />- Confusion: 5 days/week workout plan says 3 work sets, 3 days/week plans says 9 sets for major muscle and 6 sets for minor. Why such a huge difference?<br /><br />Overall good book.<br /><br />#1 Edit: This is gonna sound like a pure broscience but I noticed that I DB curled 5 more pounds and doubled my Military Press from 60 pounds to 120 pounds this morning. I was tempting to double my Deadlift weight as well if I didn't have back pain 2 days ago. I'll go for Leg routine on Sunday and will try to from 100 to 150 pounds for Squat. If it works that I'm guessing the book deserves 5 star.<br /><br />Update: 2nd week into training and I'm still feeling very strong. I added Decline bench into Chest workout for Day 1 and broke personal record by 10 pounds. Feeling awesome, the only bad thing it's really hard to stay awake at biz meetings 2 hours after Michael's workout program.
B0086DBE62|5.0|I loved this show!  It was such a fun take on a classic!<br />Having Snow White to be such a strong character and leader was great!<br />Julia Roberts was wonderful and funny!  loved the wicked stepmother!<br />Great Humor!<br />I watched the video at the end at least 20 times
B0058VW36U|3.0|i love the game but its not free!!!!!  grrr it should be free thats so not fair  :(  but i give it all five stars for being a awesome game :)
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app is great.  I loooove how the set up is and everything. its fantastic. only downside is the app always shuts down the first time or two I try opening it and it is unresponsive. other than that, its awesome!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its super easy and fast great for quick problems i love it and you should get it!!  And its free so its like a extra happy thing  haha give it a try :D
B002BWP49C|3.0|I have seen the film both at the theater and now on dvd and it occurred to me that the dvd has cut several scenes. Did anyone else notice this? I didn't see Charlie's toast at the wedding, which was great, or the scenes with Esme, Jacob, Leah and Seth, as they are guarding the house, and she is giving them food and clothes. Were there others?
B0063IH60K|1.0|IF you want to sit in the quiet comfort of your home and see all sorts of TV advertisments on your Kindle Fire..get this ap. IF you want to be interuppted between every single solitiare game you play to see a TV advertisment...get this game. BUT IF you don't want to watch TV ads on your Kindle, Amazon is offering to sell you a \\"ad-free\\" game, go ahead and buy it, IF you don't want to watch TV ..on your Kindle Fire
B008XG1X18|3.0|Takes forever to open. About 3 force close messages come up before the app will open. Usually takes about 5 minutes before the app will work.  Very frustrating.  Please fix issue now!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very enjoyable game.  Hard to put down.  Good graphics and good story.  Cant wait for the second one.  really liked this.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I had never heard of this group until they were on the tv show 'Ellen' recently. I really liked the songs they performed that day and, as I often do, went to Amazon to check it out further. Listened to several clips of songs on the CD and like them. Price was right so ordered it. Am glad I did.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|There is not a substantial story line.  Just the same things over and over.  I actually started skimming through some of the repetitious parts.  Very disappointed
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Had watched Hostel I via rental quite some time ago. Purchased Hostel II on DVD when founc on sale. Thought I had Hostel L already. Mistake. I did not. So, I ordered this one on Amazon. Am not interested in Hostel III as I have read NO positive reviews of it. I do, however like the first version that came out and, from many customer reviews, think I will like Hostel II. As these are considered some of the first of what are currently dubbed 'Porno-Horror' films, I wanted both. Not disappointed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The premise, construction, and fun are all top quality.  A bit pricey (especially if u want to expand to 5-6 players) but still worth the $$.
B008OOYALE|5.0|u guys.... I have this game on my Ipad and ipod. there's no glitches in them but there is in kindle well u can update
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Dude this movie is my FAVORITE OF ALL TIMES! Cant wait till the second one comes out, MAN IM SOO UP FOR IT RIGHT NOW! Ahhhhhhh! WELL ITS SUUUPER SAD WHEN RUE DIES... I CRIED, SHE'S SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ADORABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;) &#60;3 it!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Hard to put the books down. Wanted to know what would happen next. The triloy captured innocence, romance, thriller, and hope. Wonderful ending. Would love to see more from this author!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I am giving this book only two stars for the simple reason that the author came on Television and basically told the whole story in a nut shell.  I understand that he wanted to promote the book, but he took the major suspense out of it.  They had a model of the compound and he described in detail just about every move, every word, every action.  What's left? I have only started to read the book so I don't know yet if there is anything more that is interesting and worth having bought the book..
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the app. only thing I would like better is when playing the random hands that you could win a little more often, or is that just my bad luck lol
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This movie is unlike anything I have ever seen.  The production is wonderful, content incredible, worth every minute of watching.  Without spoiling anything, it shows that even a handicapped person can live a fullfilling life.  Have to watch it again and again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is to easy and boring I mean you stell buy it and try it and see how it is but I Stell think it is to easy. Also cool game
B0087HT36U|4.0|Great graphics and gameplay but a little slow on the reload of weapon.  Not the first game of its kind so nothing special to say about it.
0553582445|5.0|Robin Hobb draws you in from the first page and does not let go. I am on the second read of the series because I browsed through the first time in a hurry. Missed a lot of good details that I am enjoying this time around.
B008F1NICI|5.0|Reading the previous review by P.M. Clemens struck the nail on the head and perfectly square.  I don't have the skills to post a review as that one, but I will reiterate his intentions.  These release, along with the latest by Marillion, \\"Sounds that can't be made\\", are the two Combatants for Album of the Year.  Not just Prog album...I am talking any album that I have heard this year.  They are both that good.  Very \\"progressive\\" in the way they approach their instruments in their given context, with lush arrangements and powerful riffs and fills.  And both bands have passionate, heartfelt lyrics that are performed by very talented, emotive singers.<br /><br />Just buy the album, let it sink in over a few spins, listen to it at volume once it starts clicking with you.  This album is full of dynamics and grooves, from every one of the performers.  Totally solid and totally top shelf.  Just buy it.
0812550706|5.0|I have heard of the book in the past. My first impression is that how can a 10 or 13 years old kid able to accomplish so much and be so thoughtful in carrying out strategies. Well if there is a person who can make it happen, it would be Orson Scott Card. The story flows well. Characters are well developed. The vivid descriptions of the battles and strategies deployed in the book are especially engaging. Ending of the book is also mesmerizing and a little bit shocking too. Looking forward to the second and later books.<br /><br />To some avid readers, you may already know that this is not the original story. The Ender's game story has evolved overtime and gotten better. The original story was a short story that focused on the battle school. The book version brings more human touch to the main character Ender.<br /><br />No doubt that I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|this game would be awesome, if namco kept its promise, you can only play as pacman, and there's only one track to play on unless you buy the full version, its stupid, ive never given an app a bad review, but this one sucked
1400052181|4.0|Henrietta Lacks is not a household name, but Rebecca Skloot's remarkable novel illuminates how this African American woman, who died of cervical cancer in 1951, eventually shaped the course of biomedical research. I rarely read non-fiction, but I found this text's story-like format to be engaging.<br /><br />Though Henrietta only lived to the age of 30, her full story spans decades. Skloot starts with Henrietta's early life and leads us to the time of her cancer diagnosis. After her death we are shown how the famed HeLa cells go on to help scientists make discoveries in polio, AIDS, cloning, etc. Meanwhile, Henrietta's five children grow up without knowledge of their mother's (non-voluntary) contribution to the world. As they get older and are contacted by interested parties, they search for more answers and explanations regarding how their mother died and in what sense she still lives. Skloot intersperses chapters with descriptions of her own research journey and the relationship she develops with Deborah, Henrietta's daughter.<br /><br />I was amazed to learn that Skloot spent ten years researching before completing this work. It is evident that she spoke to hundreds of family members, friends, community members, and scientists who were in any way involved with Henrietta's history. The story plays out very objectively. While the harvesting and ownership of cells is clearly a bioethical issue, Skloot excellently presents both sides and leaves it up to the reader to form an educated opinion. Her scientific explanations were very clear and precise as were her observations of the Lacks family. I did find some of the scientific history to be a little dry, but for the most part, this is an excellent read!
B0087HT36U|5.0|fun game for the whole family. kinds angry bird rip off but still a fun game to play. my kids play it. my wife plays it I play it. its fun.
B004HW7JI8|4.0|After season 1's finale with Ian and the bell tower, I was excited to see more of the mystery unraveling in season 2. The story continues with A's antics causing rifts between the girls and their family and significant others. I definitely found this season creepier than the last with scenes in a haunted house, a murky lake, and a doll hospital. A continues to be one step ahead of the girls, always threatening to release a secret or damage a relationship. As everyone comes under suspicion, the identity of A is finally revealed in the season finale...or so it seems...<br /><br />I took off one star for this season only because I felt like some of the mystery was spiraling out of control. It was hard to keep track of all the suspected characters and where they were at different times and how they relate back to the clues. It also seemed like many of the arguments the central characters have with their parents or loved ones continually repeat to the point of exhaustion. I'm still excited to start the third season but I hope to see some fresh faces or at least some clarity about many of the characters.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was a lot like 50 Shades of Gray but different.  I couldn't put it down.  I love the attraction and the need felt between the main characters! I am looking forward to book #2!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Absolutely love this British fiilm! I first saw it in August, 2012, on our Queen Mary 2 cruise to Scandinavia. Couldn't wait to own it when I got home. I force all our company to watch it again with me when they drop by for an evening. It is  so romantic, it makes me cry every time I see it. I fall in love with the Sheik who decides to build a salmon run in Yemen, and has the ultimate faith to allow Ewan MacGegor the opportunity  to build it in the desert. It is so believaable that I've heard Yemen is now frantic because so many tourists are trying to book salmon trips in their country, and of course they don'[t really have a salmon run. But  you'll believe they do when you see the river rushing through the desert. And you'll love the shy romance developing between Ewan and Emily Blunt! Buy this film...you can't go wrong with it. I'm putting it in the class with \\"Shirley Valentine,\\" my first love in movies. Buy that, too, before it goes out of print.
B000SW4DH6|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie! The acting is awesome (and a bit silly at times) the songs are amazing and great to singly horribly along to, the vibrant colors vs the light and playful colors vs the dark colors of the movie correspond to what's happening in the movie which adds a little bit of something to this already amazing movie!
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was much better than critics would have you believe.  People who hated this movie probably just hate Madonna.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good time killer<br />a lot to do<br />when you are bored. fun.  easy.  graffix are pretty good too.  energy gets used up quick.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As if you where there. No fiction here. A real time account of the killing of that waste of a human being called Osama Bin Laden. Do not rely on the government's account, get it from the source.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is an amazing book for anyone in middle school or older. It is really an amazingly great book.
B0087HT36U|4.0|this was a great game that I played with my son. we both enjoyed playing this and highly reccomend it.
B0084I9QIW|3.0|My favorite album from Michael Jackson has always been BAD. The videos and the look were so cool to me. I've always considered it to be his best album. The title tracks video was actually my first memory of Michael Jackson.<br /><br />I've waited years and years to see this concert. I've signed petitions just to get this amazing concert on DVD or something so us unfortunate fans who weren't old enough to see it live could at least witness it. Our prayers were finally answered! September 18th, 2012.<br /><br />I prepared to spend at least $20 on the DVD if the price ever got that steep. Fortunately for me it didnt.<br /><br />To be honest I was kind of disappointed.<br /><br />Let me point out the good things about the concert before I point out the negatives.<br /><br />The Positive.<br /><br />Michael Jackson is spectacular. He's an amazing performer. His vocals are perfect and his dancing is top notch.<br />The set list is pretty great. Although the show doesn't really flow that well together, its still a great set list. He clearly was saving his best songs for the encore.<br /><br />The Negative.<br /><br />The quality is crappy. I understand that the this actually was formatted from a video tape but it's really terrible. It looks like a low quality YouTube video.<br />Its also presented in widescreen format which stretches the video. So it makes Michael look a little awkward. Like he's top heavy and then really small legs that are barely visible sometimes.<br />I kind of got bored. It was a great show but it didn't hold my attention for much longer.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied. I wanted more but..I'm satisfied. I don't know if I'm going to sell it or keep it for later viewing.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|The Movie is great,funny and sad at the same time my children watched it, and now there children watch it.<br />That what makes it a classic.
0446547646|5.0|i really enjoy reading this author and this was one of his most enjoyable.it usually takes me some time to read a book ,but not this one i read it in record time
B008B0QH5S|5.0|When listening to new music, one of three things usually happens: Instant love, appreciating better after a second spin or after a break, finally liking or loathing it on the third try. Elysium ended up being the later. And as I realized that I liked it, it just took hold and kept on growing. Moody, surreal and outright brilliant, with Memory of the Future quite possibly being their BEST tune ever, Elysium's varied reviews are a testament to its power.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Absolutely horrid book. No story just sex. Characters, plot, everything that makes a book a book were almost nonexistent. Definitely NOT recommended.
B0087HT36U|5.0|As the title says. Similar to Angry Birds, but more of a castle crashing theme. Extra words now due to idiotic minimum requirement
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Use a jetpack to avoid obstacles in this side scrolling game. The longer you survive, the faster the game moves. Collect coins and buy upgrades to help you go further next time. Complete odd goals to get stars which level you up (which just gives you more coins).<br /><br />It's pretty repetitive. It's the same ride over and over and over again. However the odd goals you have to complete keep it interesting. The gadgets are somewhat neat and add a little to the game. But I've also had the game lock up and close down on me several times. Been playing 5-6 days and its shut down probably 5-6 times.
B005ZUR724|5.0|ya this is about the best game ever so just saying I love it so much its hot and sweaty balls
0525953728|5.0|This book was so hard to put down. Everything was well thought out and well placed. Despite the reports questioning the validity of this book, it was extremely detailed and thought provoking. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It even gives you a sense of American pride when it is all said and done. Pick it up and I promise you will not be disappointed at all.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock has a setting where you can change the sound that you wake up to, and its really fun expiramenting with each one, seeing what's more fun to wake up to. You can also have more than 1 alarm. This is one of the best worm clocks ever, and that battery thing isn't that big a deal, because you can just charge your kindle.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series is brilliant, for those of you who grew up with out of this world series such as harry potter or twilight and are now looking for a series with just as much action and twist but more mature....then this is it!
B008J34466|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Pink, but the F-bombs and swearing on this album is too much.  I guess motherhood turned Pink the other way, or she lost her talent.  Shame on you Pink for being so lazy that you couldn't come up with bettter lyrics. I am no prude, but I don't need to listen to your crap. Even my teenager was turned off and she has lots of \\"explicit\\" albums.  The music is fun and I really enjoyed it, but I am returning it.  If it is the trash market you want to sell to, go ahead, but you have more talent than that. (I thought) I will probably buy your clean version this time, but I guarantee this family will not be going to your concert, and we will think very carefully about any future album purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy Pinterest even more with this app than on my computer!  Easy, fast &amp; clear.  Very addictive! Well done!
B004CS7R70|4.0|Well, I needed to be able to see icons and text on the 46\\" Mitsu LCD TV from the reclining love seat without having to get closer to the screen in order to do computer work. The glasses [[ASIN:B004CS7R70 Eschenbach MaxTV Glasses - 1624-111624-11]] seemed to be just what I needed. When using them I have to tilt my head just so to focus on the words and lettering. I'm not 100% satisfied, however they do save some effort in trying to read on-screen material. Pretty large investment for my purposes, but if your eyesight is bad, they may be well worth the money to help in watching television programming.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I love this cd. I can't stop playing it and I can't sit still when it's playing. You just cant help yourself, you have to move and groove with the music.
1439127700|5.0|This book should be required reading in every High School curriculum and a part of every home's library. Not only an absorbing page turner, but also revealing, thoughtful, and insightful, it will leave you shocked and angry or misty eyed, and at times, laughing out loud.  This book will plumb the depths of Nixon's ego (the section on LBJ alone, is worth the price of the book), the unshakable certitude of Eisenhower for going it alone, and it will reveal Clinton's secret longing for a father figure.  And it will do all these by providing the reader with the documented evidence required to achieve inescapable conclusions.  To understand why our Presidents do what they do or don't, keep their word or go back on it, or simply leave us infuriated or awe struck, then you must read this book!
B008M9PHWM|2.0|I have been a Dylan fan most of my life...I'm 50.<br />I have enjoyed his later works.I like the raw energy, the sparse sound is cutting and cool.<br />BUT.....This new album is basically one short hook for each song,with the verses flowing over that hook,repeated ad infinitum.<br />Problem is,that is all there is to the music, the 4-6 bar hook,nothing more,no melody,nothing you could ever try to whistle,or hum, as when a great song just sticks in your head.<br />  Of course there are a couple of songs that I enjoyed, the lyrics,or rather stories,but seems as if Bob has just compiled a whole record of written word...lacking in a whole lot of musical thought added to it.<br />Have to say this will not be a keeper for me...Gonna be \\"re-gifted\\" this Christmnas.<br />I am disappointed, as I ordered the whole fancy package with Vinyl and CD,but after listening to the CD,I must say,much like congress,I have spent my money foolishly.<br />My advice,listen before purchasing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved the honestety about Washington and their lies Tony's<br />How hard the seals practice. How we forget the protection they provide for us my kindle broke in the middle if the book read the rest on my iPhone because it was suspenseful
B0058EBNAO|5.0|It took a little time getting used to the interface, but I do see how efficiently you are able to keep up with the weather now. I believe it's a must have for any phone and they keep updating it with customer's requests.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An excellent book.  Read it cover to cover in one night.  Fascinating background on training and selection processes to join DEVGRU (SEAL Team 6)  All the controversy re: Top Secret Disclosures seems hot air IMHO  While the assault on the Abbottobad compound is decribed in great detail and the prep work leading up to it as well, I did not find any disclosure that seemed to cross the line WRT classified information.  It's well worth the time to read it and will make you proud of the work of our most special of Special Forces.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Excellent game.way too addictive.suffocatiling fun. Have not played something incredibly fascinating. Wish I could stay up all night gaming. I love seigneur hero.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really think this is a cool app! I would highly reccomend it.  Plus it is free! Never leaves you wondering how much longer your battery will last.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Like the majority of reviewers I too was disappointed in this book.  Lee Child has set the bar high with his Jack Reacher series but this book fails to live up to expectations.  It reads as if another writer, unfamiliar with the lead character, wrote this book. Wish I could get my money back.
0439813786|5.0|My 6 year old son just finished reading this book. He says \\"It's a really good story and I liked the pictures.\\"
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book was well written and careful not to expose classified detail that would compromise the United States of America.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|While primarily about the mission that concluded with the killing of Bin Laden, No Easy Day also gives us a glimpse of the type of men necessary for the job and their hard work and dedication. It gives sufficient background information about training but not so much that it gets bogged down in the grueling details. Bissonnette puts you in the middle of  Operation Neptune Spear with his first-person narrative. It's a shame the mission had to be turned into political fodder as this was about the culmination of a ten year effort by many great men and women not an \\"I killed Bin Laden\\" moment.
B005S9EJ46|4.0|Given the top quality cast in this film, I was relatively confident that a blind buy purchase of this Blu-ray (from another retailer, with apologies to my friends here at my favorite online retailer) was a worthwhile investment into something I hoped to be able to sit and enjoy watching with wife 2.0  Thankfully we weren't disappointed.<br /><br />After putting the disc in the player and seeing a couple of trailers for other films (The Descendants and We Bought a Zoo among those), I started playing this film and was immediately brought into a very brief introduction of the cast of characters that was going to be brought together on their adventures on where/how they'd spend the rest of their lives.<br /><br />Honestly, what happens to all of us as we age and get towards retirement is something I think we all somewhat fear, especially if we've not saved for our golden years.  In this particular film, we see a U.K. perspective on these events, with the various characters all basically forced into trying to stretch their limited resources because of a variety of circumstances.  In one case, it was due to investments, in another because of the death of a loved one.  Each member (or team) of the cast we're introduced seemed to have a different reason, but in the end, we knew that all would wind up at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, a promised life of luxury and opulence in beautiful India, where just a little money could be stretched a long, long way.<br /><br />Of course things are never quite what they seem and once the members of the party arrive in India they find the need to arrange alternate transport to get to their new home and even worse, once there they are greeted by a young man that is the Owner/Manager of a hotel that has certainly seen better days and is not the Best Exotic anything, at least not in the present time.  The Owner/Manager promises that better times are coming, plans for future improvements and expansion are very much on his mind, but getting there may take some time and for that he must beg for patience from his guests.<br /><br />Several events are set up early in the film that telegraph future situations and over the course of the film a viewer would, I expect, feel a strong sense of predictability and expectation.  Realistically, this is a film that does go where one expects.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a case of being hard to find surprise in, and for that I've lowered my rating a bit.  On the other hand, I would likely give this film a higher rating if it was possible to do so without giving what I would term a perfect mark.<br /><br />The performances were all top notch, and the introduction to life in India for those that aren't familiar with it is always interesting to me.  In that area, this film reminded me of the very nice film [[ASIN:B004089D7O Outsourced - Deluxe Edition]] (which inspired a forgettable NBC TV series).  I highly recommend that film and think it makes a decent companion piece to something like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  Others might lean more towards [[ASIN:B001P9KR94 Slumdog Millionaire [Blu-ray]]] which just so happens to feature a member of the cast of this same film.<br /><br />Anyway, this film did make for a decent nights entertainment for myself and my wife and I look forward to catching it later with some friends as well, meaning that I think there's some replay value here.  While the disc itself (in the Blu-ray packaging) is just the film, with no digital copy and no DVD included in the package, it was still worth the purchase price to me.  For others, perhaps waiting for the inevitable price drop is to be advised, but certainly this is a film worth putting on your own watch lists.here may take some time and for that he must beg for patience from his guests.<br /><br />Several events are set up early in the film that telegraph future situations and over the course of the film a viewer would, I expect, feel a strong sense of predictability and expectation.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It was an story told by someone who was actually there. I recommend to anyone who loves military truth about war.
0385344333|1.0|Lee Child phoned this book in, and then his publisher forgot to edit it.  Pages and pages of tedious description for no purpose and no payoff.  I am furious that an author could so short change his loyal readers and then laugh all the way to the bank. Lee Child should give all the money he makes from this book to a worthwhile charity.  So should his publisher.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  Did I mention this book was terrible?
B005OT2YVA|1.0|I love to see the Transformers in movies but I will never get the time back that I spent watching this movie.  Good actors in a crap movie do not make a good movie. Fantastic special effects do not make a good movie. A well written story and characters that you care about make a good movie.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|wasn't cheezy. was honestly well put together and played awesome on the kindle fire. really caught me off guard so I'm gonna have to check out the sequel. thanx big fish;)
B0087HT36U|5.0|Excellent physics! Love the challenges ! Keep em coming.<br />Couple changes I would like to see: Shorten load time when area is complete and once weapons are introduced there is no need to keep showing how the weapons work.
B00425S1H8|5.0|We bought this for our auto diagnostics tool so we could use the computer software.  The cable works pefectly.  It's the right lenght for the job so we're not fighting an excess of wire.  Highly recommended.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Wonderfully written story that kept me engaged, even if a little confused from time to time.  Following the diverse story lines was like walking through a labyrinth - you were not sure where you were going, but in the end you come out with everything tied into a neat little package.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This story flows and reads easily.  I commend the writer for his courage for writing the truth.  My prayers are with him through the upcoming bureaucracy he will have to deal with.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I enjoyed this production of Phantom better than the productions I saw in Chicago and Toronto, and much, much more than the dark movie version.  The camera work and close-ups, and focus of the production, leads to a much better understanding of the story and a much greater appreciation of the vocals and music.  The best production, by far!
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Wow! Where to start.  I LOVED this movie! Forget the critical reviews.  Keep in mind that the poem Beowulf is just that, a poem. It is not a story, but it hints at the story behind the poem.  And those who appreciate the beauty of the poem, yearn for the story.  This movie proposes what that story might have been, and it feels very authentic.  It is a wonderful weaving of the Beowulf poem, Viking history, and Scandinvaian folklore.  AND it is filmed in Iceland - the scenery will take your breath away. Let the movie take you away.  A few points to help you enjoy the movie:<br /><br />1) There are Vikings in the movie. So they have potty-mouths, are dirty, hairy, and probably smelly. And yes, the oft repeated four letter words are also VERY old germanic words.  So, the use of the language is relevant to the movie.<br /><br />2) The troll:  Um, he's a troll.  His vocabulary is a little limited.  That's because he's a troll.  Trolls are very central to Scandinavian folklore.  The sea-hag is another kind of troll.  They aren't the prettiest of beings, but they also aren't all bad. Keep an open mind.<br /><br />3) If you watch the movie and are a little confused in places or on the fence about whether or not you like the movie, watch it again with the director's commentary.  Then, watch it again without the director's commentary. At this point, you will love the movie.  Then you can order Wrath of the Gods, which is the behind the scenes movie for this movie.  Equally as good.<br /><br />Iceland: is beautiful and unforgiving.  The cast and crew worked very hard to bring us this movie.  I feel badly for them that the critics got it so wrong on this one.  It is a GREAT movie!!
B007RI56NY|5.0|This is my 1st Train album. I love it. I can listen to the same song over and over, hearing something new each time. They are upbeat without being abrasive to my eardrums. I liked this so much, I bought another Train album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy this game in my free time. lots of differnet games just wish it wasn't do hard to get points to open other levels.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought this was a great book. Being ex-military, I saw nothing that would compromise security. The Seals train constantly as everyone knows. The President himself brought in movie people to the most secretive room in Washington. He is the one who compromised security!!<br />The Seals are the patriots.
1439170916|5.0|This is an amazing book about cancer. The topic obviously is morbid and quite understandably the book deals with terminally-ill patients and their dying process. But this book deals with the history of cancer and the war against cancer.<br /><br />In spite of the subject discussed in the book, this book is not depressing. It is quite the contrary. I find it uplifting. It shows how science can improve our lives.<br /><br />Dr. Mukherjee discusses how biologists, oncologists, geneticists, activists and finally politicians have fought this disease.<br /><br />Some of the details involving genes, enzymes and other scientific information may seem tedious to laymen but it is worth it in the end. It gives an insight into scientic process of discovering new phenomenon, new drug and cure of a seemingly incurable disease. If this is about war on cancer, then cigaretter companies appear as enemies more than the disease does.<br /><br />It is a very long book and it is by no means an easy read. It is somewhat interesting, very informative and covers many aspects of the evolution of biology and genetics in the twentieth century.<br /><br />Every health worker and every cancer patient and their family should read it.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I love Ken Follett's work, and World Without End is another wonderful historical novel to follow up Pillars of the Earth.  I have actually just started reading it on my Kindle, but it is wonderful, great characters, human conflict, all within the framework of another time and place.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This port isn't very great. The graphics aren't close to matching the iPhone's while playing this game. There is a speed issue that makes gameplay impossible, I will suddenly start moving at supersonic speeds, and I am unable to control my character correctly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the first book so much that I couldn't wait to read the second.  I wasn't disappointed.  Once I started on the series, I couldn't put it down and read all three books in four days.  Great writing and much food for thought.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|It was a great movie.  Of course, book better but movie definitely worth watching.  Maybe not for children under 14 but it does have a message too.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I just watched the concert DVD that came with the new \\"Paul Simon Live in New York\\" two-CD set and had a great time. For the most part he stayed away from the hits and Simon and Garfunkle tunes, treating the audience to some of his less-familiar songs. Highly recommended.
0385344333|2.0|I'm a huge fan and I've read them all, but this one was a disappointment. I enjoy the Reacher series for the drama/action that make it a Reacher story, but this one was \\"phoned in. \\"
0547564651|4.0|I just got this book when I read some reviews about it - I just finished reading it and I agree with most of the author's conclusions in the book - True success doesn't come from only \\"studying\\" - which is essentially cramming dates, names of places and people and passing \\"standardized\\" tests with \\"A\\"s. That might look good on a report card and good for getting those stickers \\"My kid is an honor student at...\\".<br /><br />That just helps turn children into robots who then cannot or won't think for themselves. As a result they join society being controlled and enslaved not questioning - the curiosity is all killed.<br /><br />True success comes from character - curiosity, persistence, courage, the ability to tell right from wrong, the ability to manage stress and overcome obstacles, the ability to think different - this is why Ted Kaczynski who had an IQ of 167 as a kid and skipped 6th and 7th grades because he was so academically \\"intelligent\\", went to Harvard, got 98.9% in classes and ultimately a PhD in Math and professor at Berkley but eventually became a criminal who terrorized the nation as \\"The Unabomber\\" - while Steve Jobs who never went to college, sucked at school, playing pranks that used to get him suspended, smoked marijuana and was so bad at studying that his teachers had to bribe him to study. When that teacher had his IQ tested, he was very intelligent. But even then, high school his GPA was 2.65 but then he founded Apple and is considered perhaps one of THE greatest innovators in history.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|just amazing there is no other way to describe it if u like this game as much as I do u would get Doodle devil and Doodle farm :D
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book was a good review of the life of a Seal.  I thought the story was well told but it did get a little dry in the middle.  I was amazed on how different the story was compared to the versions presented to us from the WH and from all the leaked versions. It is nice to know the truth without endangering future missions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app; very easy to use.  I like that you can see there figures after you've enter them for calculations.
B005K17RU0|5.0|After constant trouble with The Weather Channel app, I uninstalled and downloaded this one instead. AccuWeather has worked well and keeps me updated throughout the day. Radar scans work, as do severe weather warnings.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|you have find things you should get it. love love love this game so please get it no you don't have to pay
B008XG1X18|5.0|it is such a cool way to share pictures and to keep n touch with friends and their pictures. I love how you can look at everyones pictures and look at cool stuff they post
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|enjoyed reading the books first before the movie came out.  Movie couldn't possibly incorporate all the character depth developed in the books, but still a great movie on its own.<br />Even my 6 year old enjoyed it.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1PFUNR6W7RPEQ]]This book is heavy. I don't know when YA books decided to become rivals for Greek Tragedies, but I'll be damned if they aren't putting up a good fight. You think Lake is going to be the focus of sadness, but as we get to know each main character the stories get worse and worse. While the poetry in Slammed isn't all that great it doesn't matter, because the emotion behind it is extremely intense. The only thing that irked me about the book was Lake's age.    She start's off her senior year of High School already 18. That makes no sense. It means her birthday was two weeks before they moved to Michigan which means it was in August. I guess. Because she missed the first week of school. The first week of school in these United States of America is either the first week of September, or in the last few weeks of August. So Lake got left back, right? No. Well, WTF? Sometimes if you're born at end of the year they let you wait to start kindergarten, but Lake was technically born in the summer. Sometimes people hold their kid back and have them start kindergarten when they are six, but Lake's mother made no mention of that. So what gives? Will is totally justified in his confusion. Why Lake and her mother are confused by is confusion is beyond me. I understand the author wanted to make Lake 18, so her 21 year old boyfriend would seem less creepy. So she should have just started school the second semester Senior year, her birthday should have been in January, and boom everything makes sense.    There was also the high drama. They went on one date. It seems the level of tension and devotion should have least been inspired by three dates. Especially given Will's situation. There are also scene's where Lake acts like a normal high school senior, and yet Will is not put off by her acting her age, which for him would be immature. Obviously Will's a little stunted in the emotional maturity arena too.    It was a really good book though. It was a really sad book too. If you're looking for puppies, rainbow's, and happy endings this is not the book for you. Be prepared to be emotionally jarred, and to care deeply for these fictional character's who deal with very real life tragedies.    [...]
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Although a genius in providing commentary on her time, I have often struggled with the way Austen reveals the inevitable love interest in early in her novels. This is the most suspenseful of her books that I have read thus far, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|If you can't laugh at this than you can't laugh at anything and you don't find humor in anything. this movie is an instant classic, hands down. Funny from start to finish.
B008MZPUXW|5.0|One who has never listened to a Neil Halstead record before (this being his 3rd solo venture) might listen to this and think he's trying to be Nick Drake.  To do so would be a mistake.  To do so would be to ignore his efforts with the bands Slowdive and Mojave 3. All of the records he made with those bands, and the two previous solo albums, has led him to create the most intimate, articulate and heartbreaking album of his unimaginably amazing career.<br /><br />I have listened to this album several times already and it was only released a week ago.  There aren't too many albums out this year that I have listened to more than twice.  The music is minimal: acoustic guitar, piano, upright bass and violin.  Keeping it this simple allows the vocals to become the focal point, as they should, they are some of the best lyrics he's ever written.  \\"Death runs deep in this family, writes a song for the left hand only.  Lost my arm in the first great war, wish I never learned that piano before\\" he sings in Wiggenstein's Arm.  \\"Don't worry if you don't hear nothing for a time, it's just my way\\" he laments on the closing track, \\"Loose Change.\\"<br /><br />It's difficult to write a song with such incredible sadness and beauty at the same time.  Neil Halstead has written an entire album.  It's as if he's telling us all, \\"It's ok to be sad, for a time, but it's also ok to stop being sad.\\"  I am in love with this album.<br /><br />Key Tracks:  ALL OF THEM
B001CDLATE|5.0|This film has some amazing shots. It is fascinating to watch in the way that Planet Earth on discovery, is to watch. I think that series was inspired by this though, since locations were used here first. The video quality is absolutely stunning. This Blu-ray pops with more detail than almost any other disc in my collection. I have not owned the DVD version, so I do not know how much of an upgrade the Blu-ray is. The special features are from the DVD version, explaining how it was mastered in 8k for DVD, so I assume the same principals they talked about, apply to the Blu-ray release as well.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|Hands down the greatest movie ever!!!  LSD trip on a screen in front of your eyes.  Hunter S. Thompson is the greatest author ever!  Johnny Depp and Del Toro are amazing.  A must see!

B0087HT36U|5.0|Fun little time waster. Rather simple, no frills, but fun nonetheless. A hint button would have been nice on a few levels.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|maybe not for everyone but very funny if you like old humor. i think it's more funny than the first one. if you enjoy simple stuff you'll like this. don't know why it's so funny when someone beats up an old lady, but it aways is. must see if you like this kind of stuff.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|My girlfriend is an english teacher so that makes me a literary critic. This book was ghost written on the junior high level. The military banter was entertaining for the length of the book. I was naive enough to believe our current administration and actually expected some new information out of the book. Oh well.
B007SGM084|4.0|So, I read the first Fifty Shades book after borrowing it from a friend and I loved the storyline.  I had recently been given a Kindle from my husband for my birthday so I decided to get the whole Fifty Shades Trilogy in e-book format.  While I enjoyed every page and will for sure read through these again, I wished that the price was a little lower.  Usually when you buy a package, you get a bit of a discount.  The price was the reason this only received four stars.  If you are looking for other great reads for a better price, I would recommend checking out the three story series [[ASIN:B009BB4KH8 Erotic Women's Journals - The First Three Books in One Volume]].  I thought the price was a great bargain and the quality is equally as good as the Fifty Shades books.  It might also help you not go through withdraws when Fifty Shades is over!
0525952926|5.0|Like so many others, I thought I would write a totally irrelevant review about the price, without ever having read the book. I like the price. Nuff said.

B007KZY1YY|4.0|This book confirms the hope that the evil people do can be overcome with love and understanding and that female paedophiles and female predators do exist.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is definitely one of those apps that are nice to have but you never have to think about. I downloaded this for my kindle fire and it works great. it tells you just about everything about your battery; how long it will last and how long it will charge for full battery.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book.  It was slow, did not keep me interested.  I found myself hoping it would hurry up....the ending was very weak too.  I usually really enjoy this type of a book but I was happy when it was finished.  Once I start a book I finish it no matter what.  I was hoping it would get better but it didn't.  I cannot recommend it to anyone.
B000FC11A6|5.0|This is a masterpiece.  Some of the technology is long in the tooth, but this book is simply fantastic on multiple levels.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I have wanted to get some Joe Bonamassa music in my collection for some time now and ended up getting Blues Deluxe.  This is my first cd from this artist and I must say I'm pleased.  I go to as many blues festivals as possible during the year and listen to a wide variety of artists.  I have to say Joe Bonanassa delivers some great stuff.  If you like blues or blues/rock, this is a must have.  I don't know what some other reviewers are listening to that have given a lower rating but don't be concerned.  Buy this, you won't be disappointed!

B008BIN9EW|5.0|It's a strategy game. It's a little slow and a little basic, but all in all it's the best you can hope for on android without an emulator and n64 starcraft.

B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest, but this app freezes a good bit and forces closes. Sometimes it takes two or three force closing before it actually works.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I caught this last night and enjoyed it. Of course, not all the details can be available in the movie as they are in the book. Yet, the movie follows quite faithfully.<br />The abbreviated scenes are really in non-too important areas. What I found lacking was the canon fire and the Capitols scenes in the night sky did not match the deaths.<br /><br />The casting was very good. I liked Lenny Kravitz (Cannis), Donald Sutherland (President Snow), and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch). Jennifer Lawrence shines brightly as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson is a very good lovestruck Peeta.<br /><br />I found the lack of light in the final fight scene with Cato disturbing. If one had not read the book, one wouldn't be too clear on what was going on between the three on top of the Cornucopia and the muttations on the ground. Additionally, Katniss has an ulterior motive regarding Peeta. That could have been made clearer. Actually, I believe the movie could have used a bit of extra time used on the \\"Lightly touched on parts.\\" Difficult, I know. It's almost 2 1/2 hours as is.<br /><br />The movie ends not too pleasantly for the Head Gamemaker. The ending concludes this first part of the Trilogy well, yet leaves a subtle opening for the sequel.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This popular version of the Bible is just what I wanted to have on my device for reference use during sermons and at Bible Studies.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game takes a simple concept and turns it into a clever, fun puzzle game. I love it and both of my sons have gotten into it as well.
B0089ZZXX2|5.0|If you're in the military then don't expect to be super impressed. 90% of the US population are non-military so that's probably who the movie is intended for. Even still, I liked it. It's got action and minimal side B.S. I'm glad I got it on Blu-Ray!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I had it a month ago and it was awful. Tried it again, and it is so much better! No freezing! Fast and easy to use. Highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like this very much but I wish it didn't require Internet connection :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B000UZ4G8M|4.0|I love Grey's Anatomy, and I'm always noticing the awesome music choices in each episode.  When I saw this box set for such a great price, I had to snag it.<br /><br />I'm happy with it, but I feel it's lacking a bit.  I know they can't possibly put every song that they've ever used into these collections, but I can tell that some of my most favorite songs are missing.  Just wish they had more.<br /><br />Overall, 3 CDs for $16.50 and free shipping... can't beat it.  I still recommend it for hardcore Grey's fans :)
B004VMVTNU|2.0|After having an app launch as your alarm your volume will be set to 0%.  I have to use a separate app to fix this issue.  Developers responded to this issue but are choosing to ignore it.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Refreshingly, this is one movie that follows a well written book with little deviation. Hunger Games, like many other novels of its genre, is a retelling of previously written themes but the characterization makes the book special. Because the movie closely followed the book, it made visual what was previously only viewed in the mind and enhanced the enjoyment of both media.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|bought this game only to find out on my Acct charged me 4.99 not 2.99 . careful people. I'm pissed
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|a lot of fun. easy but still challenging. can play a quick game anytime stuck waiting some where. family friendly, too
B0087HT36U|4.0|Game is great, a lot of fun to pay. but crashes too much. if the developer fixes that I will give 5 stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|im hooked, the cards move smoothly, the clairtly is great, its a great game i can even get passed the pop ups.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app, I use it on my Kindle and my Android, they sync together well. I am always able to go from one to the other and not have to look up where I was last from either device.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The case is lightweight but sturdy and I love the built in stand. The material is reasonable and from a quality standpoint I think it is great. The only issue, which for me is a minor one, is that it seems to charge the kindle in the case you have to put it in \\"upside down\\".I honestly don't think I'd even notice except that a few apps only display in one orientation. All in all, I like this case and would recommend it.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Just what was needed for collection.  Great price. Best deal anywhere. Packaging was bad, the end was open but did not affect the box inside.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I found this book hard work, I felt it was unnecessarily violent and some scenarios unbelievable. e.g how could a whole firm of carpenters disappear without their families reporting it? Plus Reacher has a lot of the Alistair Mclean  hero about him, surviving in ridiculous circumstances, perhaps I am too British!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Cant recommend this movie enough, it is as if you took all the good from indiana jones, star wars and old school Flash Gordon and through it into one film.<br /><br />Buy rent or go see this movie you will be amazed that you missed this at the theater.
B00846REIS|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time i was reading this book! Its similar to 50 Shades of Grey, but with a better storyline!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Had a glitch once, but I like how the pages flow. Searching and sharing are easy and user friendly. So glad they finally made an app for the Kindle.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read...could not put it down...kind of slow in the middle but it keeps you interested ...<br /><br />AngieeMc
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I expected a bit more about the raid itself in this book and the decision process to authorize it, but once the author documented what he could publicly (and what he had first hand knowledge of) he had to add a lot of \\"filler\\" to make it into a book versus a magazine article.  There is a lot of background regarding the Navy Seal selection and training process and the author's experiences surrounding them.  When I finished the book I felt there was a lot left to be said regarding the raid - and certainly the decision process behind it, which the author was not privy to.  Maybe we'll see more someday in the future from someone with more intimate knowledge of that process.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|it was very interesting. the characters were fun. the humor was good. i loved the horse. the quality of the animation was very high.
0345803485|1.0|This book might be alright if anything in it was at all believable. It is so unrealistic that I could not take it seriously. Like another reviewer, I found myself laughing through the sex scenes rather that getting turned on by them.<br />The book is repetitive, using the same words and scenes over and over and over again. I found myself skipping through so much of it to find any substance.<br />Someone would need to pay me a lot of money to read the other 2 books in the trilogy.<br />Do not waste your time with this book. Read Twilight instead. Same basic storyline, but at least since it's about vampires you know it's not supposed to be realistic.
B003Y5H4Y8|1.0|5 STARS= A Roller Coaster Ride, Causes an Emotional Reaction, Plot, Direction and Actor Believability<br /><br />4 STARS=Causes an Emotional Reaction, Plot, Direction and Character Believability<br /><br />3 STARS=Plot, Direction and Character Believability<br /><br />2 STARS=Direction and Character Believability<br /><br />1 STARS=Character Believability<br /><br />******************************************<br /><br />3/4 of the way through it I decided doing a online survey would be entertaining. Very disappointed by the fact the Helen Mirren just made a cameo appearance. She's the only reason I wanted to watch it.  But she couldn't save it.<br /><br />But if you want to watch a trio of Jews and a Nazi Kung Fu fight through out the film, you may give it 2 stars.  Upfront, I don't enjoy watching martial arts at all.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Really! This is a must-have for anyone who has ever had trouble getting to sleep. One of my all-time favorite apps.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's extremely exciting and enticing and I am very happy with the story behind it I cannot wait for the movies to come out
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This is a very good movie.This has scary images,like<br />the woman in black.The castle looks really creepy.<br />Things in the castle are even creepier.Loved this<br />movie,i gave it 5 stars.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I read a bunch of reviews before making the purchase, and I must say I was a touch nervous. But I wanted something light and not bulky that would protect my Kindle Fire from bangs and falls, as I inadvertently destroyed my Kindle Keyboard by tripping over the cord as it was charging. It had no case and fell off our computer table, a distance of about three feet. It hit the floor and was dead, and I was NOT going to make the same mistake with my new one!<br /><br />Well, I read everywhere I go, including on lunch at work, and so far my Kindle Fire has fallen out of my work locker (a distance of about five feet) twice. Is it still working? I'm using it to write this! This case is AMAZING. I agree that the stand part can be a little annoying, but it gets easier with use, and frankly I bought the thing to protect my Kindle, not display it, so the stand is just gravy. This thing has withstood two five-foot vertical falls and both the Kindle and case are still in perfect condition. I am a more than happy camper.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game. The variety of different types of ammunition are great and there are several levels that really challenge your thinking. I can't wait for the next installment.
0955153077|5.0|This is a great book. I just picked it up and I love it. It's not a textbook in any stretch of the word but it is comprehensive and it does show you tips and tricks. I believe this is a must have for any concept artist or digital illustrator.
0765356147|5.0|Brandon Sanderson provides a story that excites your imagination and masterfully creates a connection to the character.  He weaves the story that leads you in a direction that you least expect.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I loved this book!  Wool stands on story, rather than lasers and aliens, as a great contribution to the genre.  I can't wait to read the next installment.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|My analog speaker bar didn't have a digital audio port and my TV was not able to hook up to the speaker bar so I bought this to connect the two together... so far it has worked better than expected...  I have used it to play games off my wii, watch dvd's, tv, you name it and so far no problems what-so-ever! very happy i invested in this instead of spending another 100+ on a new sound bar!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|First and foremost, whether you think The Walking Dead Season 2 was good/bad/slow/fun or you just plain hate Hershel's farm at this point, if you are looking at this review/product then you are a fan of The Walking Dead. The 4-Disc Blu-Ray is currently at $41.96 on Amazon but for $18 more you can get the Limited Edition version which contains the Blu-Ray discs and a cool looking zombie head to put it in. The head itself is very detailed and made of a soft plastic. The base is made of a harder plastic. The screwdriver can be removed and stabbed back in the eye. The zombie head looks GREAT on my shelf next to my hardcover TPBS of The Walking Dead comics. My only complaint (and it's a small preferential complaint) is that there isn't enough room for me to fit Season 1 & 2 into it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I ORDERED THE KINDLE VERSION AND I'M VERY PLEASED WITH IT. IT IS EASY READING AND THE BOOK HOLDS YOUR INTEREST.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This book is really good as well. It focuses on how smart Jack Reacher is, he still fights but not as much. I really liked how Jack & friends took out Bo & his group. This book is good to read but I liked The Killing Floor better.
B0060D1B2C|5.0|One on my old time favorite movies.  At the end of the day the most important thing is life is family and friend.  We all are different but that's why each one of us is unique.  This movie express so much pain, struggles, unjust, abuse, but at the end true love.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Fun game angry birds style with a twist, love the attack from the front element of the game, I'm hooked on siege hero right now.
0345803485|1.0|I could only get 3/4 thru the first book and had to put it down.  Just couldn't take it any longer.  Can not believe this is a best seller.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|If you understand the weather from a technical or professional view, then you will enjoy this excellent app.True weather details with superb graphics. Clean, clear, and precise presentations worthy of meteorological center.
034580404X|5.0|Most amazing series I have read in a very long time... very captivating just couldn't put it down...  Some call it Mommy Porn...  BUT the story line was so intense and one that I was able to relate to on so many levels!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|got it for the kiddos but I cant put it down! addicting!fun for everyone of all ages! too bad more people don't play though
143911000X|5.0|Freaking AWESOME!!<br /><br />When i first started reading i just couldnt stop! Its so hilarious! Worth every single penny (even to deliver it to my country)<br /><br />Stinson Rules!
B0063IH60K|5.0|good way to pass the time. this is good app to get for free. I really like solitaire and this is a great on
B008MG1E4A|5.0|These men are to be commended for the work that they do, and the author needs cudos, not all kinds of problems as have been reported in the press.
B008XG1X18|4.0|You can pin and repin, but otherwise are limited compared to using pinterest on a pc.  You can't do any editing of your boards as far as I can tell. It's much easier to navigate using the app because it's hard to navigate on the web; the touch screen gets confused. Really, the app is vital or you may find yourself throwing your Kindle in frustration. I'm giving it 4 stars due to the editing limitations.
0385344333|4.0|I can see how some folks would not like this book because it is a little different than the other Reacher books, but I liked it. But I have also listened to all of these books on Audio rather than read it and I think for this book you get a different feel for the story when you are listening to it than if you read it.  I could possibly see how some would think it was a boring read, but it was not boring listening to it.  You truly get the feel of being there, either in the car, or out on the Iowa corn fields with the rain and wind whipping around you or even sitting in the gas station off of the interstate.  You really get the feel of Reacher's broken nose as Dick Hill does an excellent job of portraying that in the reading.  There are some really funny scenes as well that you may not pick up in the reading of the book. You pick up on Reacher's cynical sense of humor and in the car you pick up Karen's desperation of wanting his help. All I can suggest is for those of you who read the book, go back and listen to it on audio. I think you just might enjoy it.  Also, I like how Lee Child steps away from the violence a little in this book.  I think if every Reacher book was about how he kick's everyone's ass, that in itself would get boring.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is recommended that every American believing in the goodness of this country read this book. These brave men through dedication and hard work accomplish what politicians only dream of doing. The author indicates his disapproval of politicians (this administration) trying to take credit and advance their careers with the success of the Seals mission.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|the name is pretty self-explanatory but yeah the app is really good for multiplications that you just dont feel like doing yourself but it eont do exponents or anything like that. its pretty good.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|I saw this on Cinemax the other day and was kinda ticked that the critics kept me from going to see this movie in the theater.  I actually really enjoyed Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan.  The plot was decent and the characters and action sequences were great.  Overall, a much better movie than the critics made it out to be.  The critics may have single handedly destroyed any chance of a Justice League movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Such an Awesome application. Thanks loads. It is better than any other battery app out there. At an awesome price.
B0090EIILU|5.0|I wasn't sure after viewing 'Borat' how this movie would be, but this is a much much better product. Of course not for kids.
0823016714|5.0|I'm trying to learn to draw cartoon characters and to make them more life like I needed an assortment of facial expressions. This reference is the best I've found so far.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A riveting read, could not put it down, finished reading it in  two days, at last the real truth is out, and  there was no \\"Classified\\" information revealed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Never thought I would be blown away by a Bible app but this is so well designed and implemented that I am. From the choices of versions to the searching to the ability to bookmarks verses. Excellent app and at a great price (Free!)
B007GCY8FS|2.0|After pre-ordering and waiting with anticipation the book arrived on my Kindle.  This book is far from a Lee Child masterpiece.  It actually became boring, mired in unecessary detail, repetitive and just not the Jack Reacher readers have come to expect.  I have recently read $2.99 books that were better.  A huge letdown!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never knew anything about Pinterest but,  It is really fun, like making a virtual collage. I wish it was easier to pin things I see on the net but,  maybe I don't  know what I am doing. Overall I highly recommend this app. Caution it is time consuming!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you do have to purchase items but they do give you chances to win accorns.<br />its enjoyable to play. the only bad thing is it freezes up once in awhile<br />kids will like the a animation.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Easy read and very interesting.  Author had better hope the Bad Guys don't find him.  Would highly recommend to everyone concerned about the current state of our military.
B005721W9O|4.0|An unexpected sci-fi classic up there with Space Balls.  Brilliant satire with engaging plot that deftly careens from spoofing reality to enjoyable fantasy. Great casting and subplots help Imensely
B008XG1X18|5.0|great easy app to use. allows for quick topic search either by pin or board. fun stuff! worth it if you love to pin.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book. She brought everything together. I hope she comes out with a 4th book. I'm addicted to these books.
B0098VXE50|2.0|The movie made me uncomfortable for the actors.  I was embarrassed for them.  Hemsworth and Stewart were just annoying and Charlize Theron forced an uncomfortable accent and uncomfortable dramatics.  Where was Sean Bean?  (Saw him in the credits - but didn't see him in the movie or what did I miss?)  I would not call it the worst movie I've ever seen - but it could have been so much.  Too much of a bad LOTR rip-off.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. Easy to read cards. great hints. love winning hand deal. great bargain and would recommend to friends. first timers recommended.
1475143389|4.0|If your the type of person that didn't do a lot of research on the net on how to gain muscle, nutrition etc. Then this is a great book for you. I gave this to my son - he will benefit from it immensely. But if you not a beginner in the sense of knowledge you have done the research, put the time in and read a ton like myself. Then this book is nothing more then a filler for what I consider basic knowledge - now I am sure a ton of people need this info but if you have been around the block - this book probably isn't for you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This allows me to quickly check different versions and translations which is a great aid to my study time.  I appreciate that some versions can be downloaded for use offline, as well. And so many devotions to choose from!  Helps keep me accountable when I am between Bible study groups.  I tell everyone who is looking for an app that this is the only one they will need.
0061122416|2.0|I've read a lot of negative reviews about how shallow and childish this book is.  But, the worst part for me wasn't just that the boy was following his dream, but that it wasn't even his dream.  It was \\"interpreted\\" for him and sold to him by every character he encountered.  This is just like a typical get rich quick scheme except but in real life, there isn't really a chest full of gold at the end.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Mickey Haller, defender of the accused, is asked to lead the prosecution for the retrial of a convicted child murderer who has won for himself a retrial, based on, you guessed it, DNA evidence. So the first reversal is that of roles, where Mickey Haller is now trying to put the bad guy into jail, rather than try and get him freed. The second is not so much a reversal as fighting a reversal. The person charged with murder could be set free, unless Haller, Bosch, and - Haller's ex-wife, can find enough evidence to put the accused back in jail, for good. That is, of course, assuming he is guilty. Throw into the mix a witness - the victim's sister, reluctant to testify at the trial, and who has a boatload of issues from the past, that are most likely going to be raked up should she choose to testify. Add to that an unctuous defense lawyer, Jessop, who is not above, or should I say below, manipulating the media to win for himself some good publicity and for his client a possible acquittal. Yes, you are not supposed to like the defense attorney.<br /><br />This is also a Harry Bosh novel, because Harry Bosch does a lot of the investigating, including chasing down the reluctant witness. Harry Bosch, by the way, is a police detective, and a recurring character in Michael Connelly's novels, and five or six 'Harry Bosch' novels have been published to date. The writing in 'The Reversal' is taut, and the courtroom scenes are engrossing and do not drown out the plot. There is enough drama that unfolds outside the courtroom also to keep you turning the pages. The suspense over the trial inside the courtroom is matched by the events that unfold outside, with a real sense of danger engulfing both Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch. Lastly, there is Haller's ex-wife, with whom Haller is on good terms, and who serves as an assistant to the prosecution. A happy, or not so happy, family that plays together I suppose.<br /><br />All in all, a fast-paced, racy, suspenseful legal thriller.

B002BCNK1Q|4.0|great film... but quality of picture was very poor... it would intermittently stop, restream, buffer, then start ... this happened throughout the entire movie... I continued to watch only because the movie was so good that I wanted to finish watching it through to the end... makes me skeptical to order a film via amazon again
B000ERU6QC|5.0|Usually I dont like songs that are too short, but this guys make great riffs and the result is music that is very entertaining. If you dont like the new rock era buy this! Its somewhat new but very very good
B007VUA7VO|5.0|After deciding that I was tired of jumping through hoops to see my remaining battery life, I discovered this app. It's user-friendly, customizable, and allows you to quickly see how much battery life is left and how much time that gives you for certain activities.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book really kept my interest.  At the midway point of the book, just when I thought I knew what was going on....BAM!....a shocker!!!  I highly recommend this book as a 'must read'!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Do not put it in the free section if you're going to make us pay for the full version. F***ing down right stupid. The game ran smoothly but seeing those dreadful words in the on the menu select screen pissed me off. I hate companies that do stuff like this

B006AZZPCM|1.0|It used to work great and then all of a sudden it quit working! Ive tried deleting stuff but it STILL wont work! :(
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|Maybe this writer is too deep for me..but I didn't get a thing out of her self discovery. She took on a huge task of walking the trail, didnt plan well and found herself luckily to be alive. All I thought was how stupid she was...and all she planned well for was sex with strangers. The last page brought it all together but even that didn't make sense to me. I give her credit for the strength and determination to make it to the end of the journey. I'd given up way after one day.
0307463745|3.0|Rework is ok. Not great. Not bad. Just ok. It is a list of condensed ideas. Some trigger thought (personally I loved how the book beat up on \\"workaholics\\"). Others are like, duh, that is ultra-common sense (about 85% of the book). Nothing in this book teaches you how to do anything. It just long form Chinese proverb.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad book (it invokes thought). But not a great book (it doesn't invoke tons of thought). Just plain old average.  This book had so much potential, but just fell flat.<br /><br />Happy I read it, but disappointed I paid to get it.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The easy to use UI and cross platform syncing and integration is what puts this app above the rest. I use it on my phone, my laptop and iTouch and my tablet and it syncs instantly and seamlessly.

1849025975|5.0|If a person went with Middle school or High School as their only door, and basis of understanding, into the amazing works of George Orwell they might wrongly believe that he only wrote two books. \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\". Those are certainly the titles that get brought up most (and rightfully so because they're works of absolute genius). However, with such a limited perspective of all things Orwellian amazing works like Homage to Catalonia would unfortunately fall through the cracks.<br /><br />Homage to Catalonia is a first hand account of George Orwell fighting/volunteering in a Spanish militia group called the POUM, or 29th, an anti-Stalinist communist fighting force, during The Spanish Civil War. It is a beautifully written account of his personal experiences and impressions he had of both the war and his role in it. It also sheds light and context into an unfortunately (these days) obscure historical period. No doubt it's somewhat obscure to most Americans and Europeans because it was eclipsed a few years later by World War 2. I would think most Americans unless they've read some Hemingway or watched \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" would be completely unaware that Spain ever even had a Civil War recently let alone that it occurred during the time of FDR's Administration. So close historically that it's possible there might even be people alive today that experienced it. However, this is unlikely because it's 2012 and if they were alive today they'd certainly be really old now. However, I digress.<br /><br />\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a wonderful read and well worth the time needed to get from cover to cover. If you're interested in a work that doesn't over-glorify war or go the other route and go wild condemning it. This is your book. It is a good read that sheds light on a part of Spanish history that should never be forgotten (or perhaps worse, contoured through revisionism to be whatever some political hack wants it to be and wants it to mean). My advice is to read \\"Homageto Catalonia\\" if you want a very good read and a good history lesson to go along with it.
B00362DRNG|3.0|I like the remastered music; additional music from Demo's, live versions and 12 inch.  The DVD is ok, allot of the same songs.  I wish they would of added the concert that was aired on Nickelodeon back in 81 titled 'OFF THE RECORD'.  It would of been worth buying having a remastered audio and picture.  All in all, again it would be good as a collectors item if your a true duran duran fan.
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG IT WAS AMAZING!!!!! its addicting my high score is 185 thousand something but im very glad they chose to put this game on the kondle pepple should definetly play.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Coming from a short term law enforcement back ground, I know what training is all about. However, what these men do is by far way beyond what I have ever done or trained for. The physical task is enough, but what comes with this job is something that takes strength and maturity and skills way beyond your average person. Your average person could not even begin to deal with the head spinning emotions associated with this field.<br />The respect I have for these men is 100 fold what I ever felt before. I know what they do is for America to preserve our freedoms and our GOD given rights that we inherited from our forefathers who likewise fought. I thank each and everyone of them.<br />I loved the book because it was written with heart, for everyone to understand. It wasn't above those of us who are not college graduates. (By no means am I saying that those who didnt graduate from college are dummies).  But a high school student or a drop out can read it and understand now what these men do and how they sacrifice their lives.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|what a wonderful way to learn about another culture and era!  It combines the thrill of \\"soap opera\\" stories with actual historical details. I can't wait for season 3!!

B002I0J5FG|5.0|I played these two games when they first came out and still have them. In fact, I still play Shadow on my PS2 from time to time. But now the HD remake is here and the graphics have been given a great deal of polish, making both games look amazing. Don't be fooled though, even with the HD upgrade, the games do show signs of age.<br /><br />Out of the two, Shadow is probably my favourite and the one I've been recently playing through remote play on my PS Vita. To use remote play, you must first update your Vita and then the game itself. The quality of the game and frames will depend on your network and the signal from both your PS3 and PS Vita.<br /><br />Both games share a key feature. They both have an ominous feel to it that will keep you glued to the controller. The background sounds are creepy and quiet, not really sure how to explain it, but it gives the games a unique feeling.<br /><br />If there's something I could complaint about, would be ICO's controls, that at times can be frustrating, the feeling is gone after a few minutes of trial and error. Players new to the series may have mixed feelings, because at heart, this is a PS2 game. Fans of the series will pleased to see the great games looking better than ever, but most importantly, to see that the games have not been altered in any way that would ruin the great original experience.
0765350386|4.0|Like others have said, I wish it were possible to rate something by half stars. Mistborn (book 1) is definitely worthy of more than 4 stars, but I personally do not give books 5 stars unless they have such a strong, emotional impact upon me that I never look at the world the same way after reading them. (i.e. very few books do that for me). With that said, Mistborn is an awesome read!<br /><br />I became a Brandon Sanderson fan through his writing podcast before I even read his books -- then I read Elantris, a great stand alone novel, but Mistborn really blew me away. The magical powers are refreshing, and the the premise of the world is unique, eery, and just has a \\"cool factor\\" than few fantasy worlds have. Sanderson is a master at balancing the immersive experience people desire from epic fantasy and actually setting a pace which doesn't travel at a snail's speed. One of the biggest pet peeves -- for me -- in epic fantasy is the tendency for authors to drone on, and on, about pointless stuff. This is supposed to make the world more \\"real\\" or immersive, but really just bores me to tears. Sanderson has found that near perfect balance and is becoming a great master of it.<br /><br />The characters are realistic, sympathetic, and a bit surprising. I found myself rooting for Vin through the book, smacking my forehead when she'd make a mistake, and getting angry with her when she didn't \\"get\\" something she should have. That's what great authors can do, and Sanderson has done just that. Kelsier is a great character as well, and the ending to the book definitely surprised me -- again, all good things.<br /><br />I love epic fantasy, but I also love page turner novels. Mistborn is kind of the best of both worlds -- it is an epic fantasy, page turner! I'm in the middle of book 2 at the moment, but couldn't wait any longer to review book 1 -- which I give 4.5 stars!!!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I would like a refund, this book a waste of time, i have ready everyone and this one is terible.  b uyers beware on this one
B004UID2LC|4.0|I got this app around the time I got the kindle. it had work perfectly. Now it wouldn't let me download any of the songs.  get it fix!!!!!!! D:
B007GCY8FS|4.0|These books by Child are great airplane reading.  They are mindless and formulaic.  The whole series so the criticisms are unwarranted.  The characters are all the same but that is OK.  The books are what they are.  This one-A Wanted Man-is as good as the others.  A quick read that makes long flights OK.  This isn't intended to be great literature.  I look forward to the next since I am bored on long flights....
B008J34466|5.0|Pink has managed to make a great melodic album without losing her fire and spice.  At 33 years she has not lost her edge and yet possess one of the greatest voices in the industry.  She quit smoking and her increased range and power show on the first great single of many, Blow Me (One Last Kiss).  Entertainment weekly calls her the best lyricist in the business and her songwriting seems to get better with each album.<br /><br />Kelly Clarkson calls Pink and Adele the two greatest female singers in the business because their live vocals are more than equal to the ones they cut in a recording studio.  Lets start with talking about some of the best ballads she has ever written or recorded.  Kelly Clarkson Stronger producer Greg Kurstin lends his genius on both Blow Me as well as the churning and melodic follow up single Try, one of the many highlights on this diverse and eclectic album.<br /><br />The absolute highlight of the album has to be the duet with Nat Ruess of Fun on the future Grammy nominated song of the year, Just Give Me A Reason.  This song's thumping and hypnotic beat reminds me of Sinead O'Conner's Nothing Compares To You, yet it is completely original and breathtaking and tells the delicate story of a couple much in love with some insecurity they are desperately trying to deal with.<br /><br />Genius songwriter-producer Dan Wilson who co-wrote Adele's Somebody Like you, contributes another masterpiece with Pinks songwriting prowess on The Great Escape.  This tender piano ballad deals with someone trying to get through a rough patch in life by taking the easy but wrong way out.<br /><br />There are some clever and well written rockers as well on this brilliant album including How Come your Not Here, a bluesy rocker where Pink's really missing her man, Slut like you, where she defends a woman's right to be as sexual as a mans in a funny, but provocative way.<br /><br />Eminem cleverly contributes to Here Comes the Weekend, a stomping rocker that will begreat in a live showcase or arena.  The title track is a retro throwback to the 60's and features some very clever lyrics from our lady about the secrets and mysteries of love.<br /><br />Walk Of Shame is another clever rocker about facing the world after a night of partying.  Another outstanding ballad comes with Where Did The Beat Go, a song whose marching drums match the theme of the title and details the need to keep the spark from leaving a relationship.<br /><br />Billboard magazine reports that the extended version of the album is well worth the additional price and features one of the album's best songs, My Signature Move.<br /><br />The Truth About love features more possible hit singles than you can shake a stick at.  It features one of the finest voices and best songwriters in the business who has been making some of the most diverse and striking pop music in the new millennium!
B00846REIS|5.0|This was recommended to me by someone else and I'm so glad I read it.  Loved this story line, I couldn't get enough.  Can't wait to continue the story into the next book. Definitely worth giving a try.

0446567337|2.0|I have read several other Nicholas Sparks books in the past so I knew not to expect literature, but rather a quick easy read. Unfortunately, this book offered up only cliche after cliche. After reading the first couple chapters, I could tell you exactly what was going to happen (although there were some twists that added a little to the story, which is why I gave it 2 stars).  Sparks really needed an update in conversational language that people use today, because these two sounded nothing like 20 somethings around 2001, especially Savannah who sounded like a 50's era character most of the time. He also relies to heavily on letter writing and completely ignores modern ways soldiers and their families keep in touch. This couple has none of the magic or spark of Noah and Allie in the Notebook.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Amazon recommended this album to me based on some previous purchases, I was skeptical, but I sampled a few of the songs, and thought hmm this is interesting.  I bought it, and then I listened to the entire album on repeat for a good 4 days.  Their songs just make you want to keep listening, there isn't one song on this album that I don't like, or that I would skip if it came on.  You will love this album!!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|While this was not my favorite Jane Austen, ordering from Amazon is great. I totally recommend using them for literature or DVDs

B005DNPJKU|3.0|We enjoyed the movie itself as best we could considering the feed. The content was not the issue. I have a high speed internet connection and we watch streaming and downloads fairly often. However this was very choppy, starting and stopping and the sound being off from the visual often. I contacted Amazon and informed them of the problem. I'm still not certain what the problem was but I will hesitate to purchase a movie showing again unless it is my last option (this was for school).<br /><br />It was an easy transaction and very easy to follow, no issues there at all.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|the service was great, got the dvd quickly but keep having problems with the disk playing correctly. I have tried numerous methods to resolve the problems but as yet haven't been able to. Don't believe it's a fault on the sellers part, just a problem with the disk. In one section there is no sound and right after that it skips ahead and leaves out a scene.
0385344333|1.0|This is the worst book in the series by a long shot.  If this was your first Reacher novel you'd never pick up another.  Altogether a disappointing and lackluster effort by Lee Child<br /><br />And Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher.  Just saying'!
B0084IG7KC|4.0|When I saw the movie in theaters, I hated it. I had just reread the book and all of the details were fresh in my mind. The movie changed some details for no apparent reason, e.g. Peeta gets a syringe -- not ointment -- for his leg in the book. I liked the movie better the second time but it's still disappointing to me. It seems much more bland than the book. The arena isn't nearly as terrifying as you might expect. Katniss is supposed to almost die of dehydration, but the movie makes it seem like she finds water instantly.<br /><br />The movie feels like you have to comprise, but I would say it's still worth watching.
0553801473|5.0|I discovered the books after watching season 1 of The Game of Thrones on HBO. I have been an avid reader and lover of books my entire reading life, but I have never, and I mean NEVER have read books by an author that have appealed to my imagination like George R.R. Martin's books have. The A Song of Ice and Fire series are my all time favorite books and I can not think of one negative thing to say about them other than that I wish the last two books were written and published already! But, then I would also be sad, because I hope the series doesn't end! LOL I've read the entire A Song of Ice and Fire series twice, and will probably read it a third time before the Winds of Winter is released. In the meantime, I have started reading other books by George R.R. Martin, like Fevre Dream, which is about vampires in the mid 1800's, steamboats on the Mississippi, and New Orleans. I am enjoying the book very much. George has a way of writing fantasy that seems believable and real. I love that his writing is so detailed, that plots and story lines are so drawn out, and that the good guy doesn't always win. That's real life stuff. Buy the whole series. You will not regret it. And once you start, please visit Westeros.org on the web. It's the fan site for the books. There's a fabulous forum were every detail has been discussed over and over again! I finished the books well over a year ago and Westeros.org is still a daily visit for me.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Is Clare Danes the best child actor ever?<br /><br />It's a tough question!<br /><br />But it is also a question I've been asking myself a lot lately. Though, if I was gonna be honest with you, I think I'd still pick Jerry Supiran from \\"Small Wonder.\\" He holds a special place in my heart and a have a photo of him in my wallet that I printed out from the Internet.<br /><br />Clare Dane went to Yale so she's obviously a little better than the rest of us. I heard her on the NPR this morning and I could have been not more impressed. She just has a way and she talked a lot about how she got into character by watching a lot of YouTube videos. Heck, maybe I got what it takes to be an actress. I love YouTube.<br /><br />She also went on to say that in one scene she did not know what her face was doing and how could she, as she gets so deep into her character. Sometime I don't know what my face is doing neither. Like when my cousin Rimmy Jo Buckles and I went to that Adam Sandler movie (I love Adam Sandler BTW) and I thought it was funny but Rimmy said my face was frowning the whole show.<br /><br />I hope Clare Dane I get married, but I hope she doesn't go on the NPR no more because she came off as a little bit full a herself.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|I've had few consumer experiences bad enough to demand that I write a review and warn people away, but this movie ranks as one of the worst.  Ten minutes into this lifeless drivel, with its stilted, laughable, recycled dialogue and rampant overuse of the \\"make stuff look melty\\" button by the special effects department, I knew I was in for a real winner.<br /><br />I found myself compulsively tweeting, trying to find anyone who could help me reconcile the fact that this stuff was actually happening on a film that presumably went through some editing first.  Why do those mushrooms have eyes?  Why were the fairies depicted as poorly rendered little gray naked people?  Did they use the whole CGI budget on making Kristen Stewart appear vaguely lifelike?  Why does that troll just want a hug?  Why is Chris Hemworth's accent so weird? Why won't Stewart ever close her mouth?  Why was she already wearing pants and boots in the dungeon, and why is the Duke's army suddenly fully equipped and ready to go kill the vaguely evil queen after one of the most dismal, idiotic inspirational speeches in the history of Hollywood?<br /><br />Surprisingly, Stewart isn't even the worst part of this movie (I did enjoy watching her slog through poo water), and that's saying something.  Sam Claflin was the only one who looked like he was even bothering to show up to work, stuck in the middle of an otherwise wooden cast that often appeared just as confused and annoyed as I felt.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Save your $3.99 and go watch...well, just go watch anything else instead.  Some drying paint might be mildly more entertaining.  But don't tell the CGI people - they might want to try to cover Ravenna in it again for absolutely no discernible reason whatsoever.
B0016O95IW|4.0|I purchased this album after buying The Truth Is....I Lied About Everything. I knew a few of the songs from this one and had seen them live but I really like the whole CD, which is a rare occurance for me.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have been a huge jack reacher fan. read and re-read all of the previous reacher books. I feel terrible to say this new book is really bad! reacher lost all his charm, plot is terrible and unbelievably thin, and the dialogue reads like chewing on a piece of wax.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Wow I just received my product today and I am very impressed. I'd like to thank Amazon for providing such good and secure packaging for this product. Humor me, when I first opened this and booted it up I \\"Thought\\" I had one dead pixel but it was just a piece of dust, I was VERY relieved haha. Amazon shipped it very fast and on point, ordered it with 2 day shipping, got here right on time 12 o clock sharp.<br /><br />But seriously this is a great product and well worth the price, PC games are used to the average size of a laptop's screen which is 13.5 - 14 inches (Somewhere around there.) and this is 15.5 and I gotta say this G155 PGE is way bigger in person than anything you see in pictures and such. The screen is big enough, trust me, and the screen is more vivid and crisp than some of my other high end Samsung LED TVs. The color is terrific, you can adust the brightness saturation and contrast in the menu and also tweak the audio a bit which is a nice addition.<br /><br />I played with the G155 for a whole day now, playing Dead Space constantly, and I was worried that it would be too dark for me considering what everyone has said but once you tweak the settings and get the brightness right, WOW this thing is beautiful, bright colors, crisp graphics, and terrific transitions.<br /><br />I want to talk about the speakers that everyone commented on, it is true that the stereo speakers included are mediocre at best but it's not a big deal because most people who use this product use headphones, I on the other hand use both head phones and a X mini capsule speaker (Look it up) to enhance the sound and it is perfect. The X Mini Capsule Speaker II is a perfect addition to the G155 because it blends in with the black and red and it's also a very good high quality portable speaker.<br /><br />I was honestly thinking about getting the Vanguard because of it's 19 inch screen but I have to say, only get the Vanguard if your a die hard fan of halo and really need the 3.5 additional inches. The screen is really big enough it looked so small in the pictures but once I started playing, it was awesome, I wasn't squinting, I wasn't up close to it. It is the perfect size screen.<br /><br />The case features are well made, my xbox is nice and secure when it's strapped in and ready to go. It is very durable and even with everything packed inside of it, it's not really that heavy and unless you're carrying it from hours and hours on end, then it shouldn't be too much to handle. The pouches fit everything in all nice and snuggly. I have the power brick and hdmi in one pouch and my Controller, charger for the remote, and ac adapter in the other everything fits perfect. Also take NOTE * Please remove any disc from the xbox and make sure all wires are in your pouches and are secure to prevent damage to your G155 or Xbox Console Disc tray and Actual Game itself. *<br /><br />I also want to note, the remote does not come with it but I just wanted to say is that once you get the perfect settings suited to your taste you probably won't have to mess with it again, so buying a remote isn't necessary but do buy a remote if you're really in desperate need of one. *HDMI IS INCLUDED*<br /><br />This product is amazing overall and makes a great gift for gamers and all gamers should have one of these just because they're so beautiful. I mean I have a perfectly functioning 900 dollar Samsung LED 1080p 32 inch TV but I still like to use the G155 as my preference for gaming. * I would also like to note that some people are skeptical about it not being 1080p but you can't notice a single thing about it. The Monitor is just simply beautiful, the colors are once again Vivid and bright, Graphics are crisp and transitions are beautiful. You can't even notice that it's a 720p monitor. Great job Guys! *<br /><br />* If you do not respect this product, well then you're just missing out, I guarantee there's a lot more people that like it than people who don't like it ratio.*<br /><br />- Again I would like to thank John Smith and his Project Gaems team for making such a beautiful outstanding product and for having such wonderful Customer support. If it weren't for John Smith replying to me as fast as he did, I probably would've waited til Christmas to buy this. Their company is simply wonderful and I look forward to their future products and I can't wait to see how far their company grows. (Definitely buying future products when possibly.) -<br /><br />Price - 4/5 It is a little steep but the original price is 300 and is now 250 on amazon so it's practically a steal, I don't mind (I like to break it down to 220 for the LED monitor and 30 for the durable case. It may not be that way for everyone but I like to break it down that way to make myself happy.)<br /><br />Durability - 5/5 This thing is very durable, it protects my xbox without any problems and is TSA Approved for flight travel.<br /><br />Fun - Definite 5/5<br /><br />Portability - 5/5 People say it's not portable because it doesn't have a internal battery but Seriously (GO look up the definition of PORTABLE.) And even if it did have a internal battery you would have to plug it in eventually to charge it back up. (Realistic Expectations Guys!)<br /><br />Monitor Display - 5/5 15.5 720p LED/LCD monitor is simply beautiful and is well big enough for once person. Realistically it is good enough if 2 people were sitting side by side and watching the display at one time. Any more than 2 people won't really work out, since the viewing angles aren't that good, but in all honesty this is made for 1 person to play on, maybe 2 max! If you need a lot of people to see it than just switch to a bigger tv don't complain about something that wasn't meant for multiple people in the first place.<br /><br />Overall Product - 10/5 Easy, this G155 Personal Gaming Environment is highly recommended for anyone!<br /><br />Customer Service 20/5 - John Smith takes time out of his day to tend to everyindividual questions and concerns you have, and in a very considerable short amount of time too! If that's not excellent customer service than I don't know what is. Thank you Project Gaems!
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|If you want to watch something that was written for effect rather than story and requires very little brain power to understand, this show is for you!  Unnecessary nudity, sex, and violence abound.  I am sure it will be a great cult film someday.

0312641893|4.0|I have heard so much about this book that I was excited when I finally had a chance to sit down and read it- I have to say, it wasn't at all what I expected.  I think I am going to break this review up into positives and negatives- negatives first.<br /><br />What didn't I like about this book?  Well, to be honest, most of what i didn't like centered around the fact that this was a book about cyborgs. I don't like reading about robots or cyborgs, or science fiction in general.  Based on everything I had heard about this book, I really wanted to try it anyway, because I knew everyone had loved it.  It took me 75% of the book to get over the cyborg hurdle.  Honestly I think that was because so much of the story was about science through the first part of the book that I couldn't move on from it until the point in the book where the story focus was more on the Lunars and less on science.<br /><br />What did I like about this book?  The fact that it felt like I was reading about Sailor Moon!  I am a HUGE Sailor Moon fan and I have to say, I loved reading about  a Moon Kingdom and Moon Princess!  The story between Prince Kai and Cinder was enjoyable, although I had a hard time believing they were in love after only meeting a few times.  I felt like that storyline was redeemed for me at the end when the story took an unexpected turn.<br /><br />All in all, this was a pretty good story. Was this the best fairy tale retelling I have ever read?  No, but I think that may have to do with how much science fiction was in the book.  But I will read the second book in the series because I did enjoy Cinder.
B005LCYR7Y|3.0|THe premises are really good. I like the basic ideas and the approach to a SciFI theme but from a normal person point of view, where there is no understanding of why or how. No weird scientific blabla, just experiencing something not understood ... but then the main plot and the main \\"even\\" gets discloses and all is gone. The moment the direction the book was going got clear, this book turned into a sort of fictional way to re-look at an historical event that got much less interesting.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|Fun game.....but the screen going unresponsive for ten seconds at a time kind of makes it impossible. Awaiting an update.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Ka-Boom! What a difference this little amp makes for your audio! Not only is the audio quality immensely improved, but you can tweak this for your listening pleasure. Basshead? Crank up that EQ, Gain and Power Output underneath the battery. Not a basshead? No problem! This amp is very versatile with the sound output to suit any kind of music.<br /><br />  Here is a breakdown of the features:<br /><br />EQ: This alters the amount of bass that is integrated into the audio. 0 is basic amplification, closer to the original source. 1 is a little extra bass. 2 is even more bass. Even with the extra bass on 1 & 2, the sound stays balanced with no leakage into the other sound spectrums<br /><br />Gain: This heightens the amount of amplification and opens up the soundstage* a little bit, great if your phones are a little flat on soundstage.<br />Power output (underneath the battery): this little switch allows you to increase the power of overall amplification. This means that the sound can be more powerful, but at sacrifice of battery. I have found that the Low setting works just fine for my needs.<br /><br />Radial Volume knob: Pretty basic, it's a volume knob. It's really nice though excellent volume control, sturdy feel as well.<br /><br />Design: Small, yet very well built. It's about a quarter smaller than my 7th Gen iPod Classic, and about as thick. It's also light weight, so it won't make a too noticeable difference to your gear.<br /><br />Accessories: The E11 comes with a short 3.5mm male to male for transferring audio from the source to the amp. It's very short, as in 3\\" short. This is good though, because this amp is designed to \\"piggyback\\" on your portable audio source. You can use this on a laptop too, but it's primarily for portable use. It also comes with two little rubber like bands for piggybacking, and stick rubber feet to stick on the bottom of the amp for whatever reason you wish, very handy.<br /><br />Summary: if you care about sound, this little amp is your companion wherever you go. Light weight, sturdy, quality made, amazing sound, and for the price this can't be beat!<br /><br />Hope this helps. Happy Shopping!<br /><br />*Soundstage*: soundstage is the 3D presentation or depth of the audio. The best soundstage is at a concert. So if your phones sound like you're at a concert, you've got a quality pair :)your companion wherever you go. Light weight, sturdy, quality made, amazing sound, and for the price this can't be beat!<br /><br />Hope this helps.

0312430000|3.0|I've just finished reading Atul Gawande's The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.  I am struck by how useful a simple checklist can be to professionals as divergent as surgeons in the emergency room to commercial airline pilots in eliminating potentially fatal mistakes in incredibly stressful situations.<br /><br />While not usually life threatening, our decisions and actions in the entertainment industry are likewise plagued by constantly changing circumstances and fluctuating stakes presenting a thousand ways a deal could get squirrely, a project derailed, an opportunity ruined - a dream, crushed.<br /><br />Each of the stressful hats I wear, from being a director helming an 80-person cast and crew through the pressure cooker of the infinite uncontrollable variables of principal photography, to the landmines an independent filmmaker must avoid while seeking production funds and distribution, to a screenwriter, pitching my heart out to unpredictable executives, could perhaps be lessened with a simple analysis of past successes and failures to create a checklist before embarking on future endeavors.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that the emotional rollercoaster of these uncertainties could somehow be distilled to critical path decisions and actions to stay on point, but imagine the strides that could make towards health in Hollywood - not to mention, perhaps, even better product.<br /><br />In his book, Gawande makes the distinction between mistakes we make because we don't know enough versus the mistakes we make because we don't make proper use of what we do already know. Failure in our modern world is less due to errors of ignorance than it is to errors of ineptitude. Perhaps, this is partly due to our vastly accelerated pace of life. Perhaps, it's because so much of our professional activities rely on cutting edge technologies that require increasingly segmented expertise that inevitably exceeds any one person's sphere of knowledge. Thus, the true cornerstone of success in our new millennium will likely be teamwork - and effective leadership.<br /><br />The Checklist Manifesto examined case study after case study across a wide gamut of fields but this particular point was best driven home (literally) by his analysis of Chesley \\"Sully\\" Sullenberger, the \\"Miracle on the Hudson\\" pilot, who expertly ditched US Airways Flight 1549 onto the frozen river after inadvertently plowing through a flock of geese. Much as the media tried to lionize him as an individual hero, his humility persistently clarified that it was an ensemble success, largely thanks to adherence to protocol. The famous tried and true checklist.<br /><br />Training and experience, of course, are key, but when the going gets really tough, sometimes it's good to have a checklist of the most important things to pay attention to as you're going through the worst of it and don't have time to think or react. Just read and do. Or do and confirm.<br /><br />Gawande writes: \\"It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment. It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among us - those we aspire to be - handle situations of high stakes and complexity. The truly great are daring. They improvise. They do not have protocols and checklists. Maybe our idea of heroism needs updating.\\"<br /><br />It's interesting.  I've spent over five years helping two brilliant entrepreneurs raise money for, focus group and beta test and develop their patented software, LitCentral, that could literally revolutionize literary development the way nonlinear editing forever changed the landscape of post-production (along with virtually every other collaborative workflow process with lots of cooks in the kitchen from governmental legislation to medical diagnosis and treatment to name just a few). Everyone's initial knee jerk reaction has often been the same: \\"How can you distill such a creative and subjective process to quantifiable analysis?\\" But the truth is, as Gawande proves, is: \\"...what is needed...is discipline...discipline is hard - harder than trustworthiness and skill and perhaps even than selflessness. We are by nature flawed and inconstant creatures...Discipline is something we have to work at.\\"<br /><br />And LitCentral, uniquely, offers discipline to a wildly erratic and undisciplined part of the development process.<br /><br />The author continues elsewhere: \\"We don't study routine failures...when we look closely, we recognize the same balls being dropped over and over, even by those of great ability and determination. We know the patterns. We see the costs. It's time to try something else. Try a checklist.\\"<br /><br />Gawande references Geoffrey H. Smart's fascinating 1998 report The Art and Science of Human Capital Valuation. Straddling the worlds of art and commerce, I found the correlations fascinating between how Venture Capitalists identify that rare entrepreneur who can actually execute their idea and studio or network willing to greenlight one artists' project over another.<br /><br />Hollywood decision makers and power brokers, almost identical to their Venture Capitalist brethren, must delineate between all the charismatic dreamers with intriguing ideas to discern the extremely rare visionaries who can actually execute their proposals to reality. In film and television, at least, the risks are mitigated by pairing the entrepreneur or artist with a Show Runner or Producing partner who has proven their ability to manage teams and cope with setbacks, people and technical problems to manifest the shared vision of the project - until that individual is allowed the reigns solo.<br /><br />Our industry is almost completely reliant upon human capital.<br /><br />Let's see if you recognize any of the venture capitalist human capital valuation practices Smart identified as your own approaches (or those of professionals you've worked with - or not been given the opportunity to):<br /><br />Venture Capitalists' Human Capital Assessment Methods<br /><br />  * The Art Critic - Assesses at a glance, intuitively, based on extensive experience<br />  * The Sponge - Does extensive due diligence researching and soaking up information, then goes with gut<br />  * The Prosecutor - Interrogates aggressively, tests with challenging questions, drills with random hypothetical situations<br />  * The Suitor - Woos versus analyzes<br />  * The Terminator - Convinced from the start it's a doomed venture, skips the evaluation altogether, buys up the best ideas, fires the originators as incompetent and hires replacements<br />  * The Infiltrator - Gets in on the inside to spy for him or herself<br />  * The Airline Captain - Uses a formal checklist to diligently study past mistakes<br /><br />Smart's study showed, not surprisingly, given The Checklist Manifesto's more recent research, that the Airline Captain methodology had the best Internal Rate of Return: 80% median return compared to 35% or less for all of the other types.<br /><br />Sure: experience counts. But adding a checklist to the gut instincts of the Art Critic and the systematic analysis of the Sponge was perhaps the trifecta.<br /><br />I started out my career in Hollywood as a Sponge (and I'll always be one, a voracious reader and education and research junkie). As my confidence in my own skills and taste grew over the past decade and a half, I became some variation of the Art Critic.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I do not know if one could do a forensic analysis about the authenticity of this writing. It feels a little off of the usual Reacher novels (I have read them all, with the exception of \\"The Affair\\"). The chapters are short. The narrative is wandering and hesitant, like a drunk trying to walk straight. (\\"He was tall. Or short. Or maybe it was a she. Or was not.\\") Reminds me of the currently fashionable and nauseatingly shaky camera moves a la Bourne movies. (It feels, now that the possible flow of Reacher movies is about to begin, the writer just started writing a script of a movie instead of a novel) The lack of clumsy and awkward love scenes is actually great relief. Honestly, loving may not be Reacher's best talent, anyway. Gun descriptions are still amateurish (A baddie with a .22LR caliber pistol or a nighttime sniper with an iron sighted .308?) But I still think this book is enjoyable and entertaining. I do like the set up in the car. It is something new and to me it never felt boring. It displays Reacher's observing and thinking skills, builds tension and moves the plot. One does not read Reacher novels to have multidimensional, conflicted heroes, therefore the characters are just as complex as in any other Reacher books. The shootout is great, finally the bad guys appear to have a more evolved AI (but not too evolved). So I feel the criticism around here is a little too harsh. Take this book as a new flavor and not as a disappointment for being unlike the others. Just keep on writing, Mr. Child...

0307744434|4.0|Scanning through the reviews, it's evident that people either love or hate this book.  There seems to be little in between.  If you attend enough writers' conferences, you'll end up reading more than one carnival or circus story based on Ray Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\".  Most aren't worth reading. Maybe they the negative reviews harken back to those writer's conferences. I'm not sure, but this is a book worth reading.  Good premise, not derivative of Bradbury, strong plotting and interesting characters with strong conflicts.  Hey, I liked this book. Give it a try.
B008ROGZUU|5.0|In terms of concept, design and staging, there is nothing particularly innovative, imaginative, original or even too exciting about Jonathan Kent's direction for this 2011 Royal Opera House production of Tosca. It adheres to the period locations and action as they are laid out in the original libretto, each of the three acts recognisably taking place in specific locations in Rome - Act 1 in the church of Sant' Andrea, Act 2 in the Palazzo Farnese, Act 3 on top of the Castel Sant' Angelo - actual locations that have been used in the past for filmed versions of Puccini's opera. If there's little that is striking about the stage designs, which are functional at best, Kent stages the dramatic action within them to the full extent of the verismo realism that the opera calls out for.  What distinguishes a good traditional production of Tosca from all the others however, and what makes this Royal Opera House production something special, is the casting and the ability of the performers to bring something of their own unique character and ability to the work. It's hard to imagine a more stellar contemporary cast in the three principal roles than the one assembled here.<br /><br />As Floria Tosca, Angela Gheorghiu is the ultimate diva playing a diva - a fact that she acknowledges in her interviews and clearly relishes. Those characteristics can often be pushed a little too far with this particular singer, who often plays the diva whether it's called for or not, but here at least it's appropriate and Gheorghiu is totally convincing. It's more than just good casting of course, since, as ever, Gheorghiu sings superbly. And not just from a technical viewpoint - which is hard to fault - but it's also an impassioned performance that is perfectly judged with complete understanding of her character and fits in well with the overall tone of the whole production. Consummately professional then - you would expect no less - but Gheorghiu is also genuinely impressive on every level.<br /><br />Jonas Kaufmann is another performer who continues to impress, slipping effortlessly into whatever role he plays with a great deal of personality, but more than impress, the manner in which he brings that extraordinary voice to bear on such familiar roles is absolutely astonishing and quite unlike any previous account you might have heard of that role, so far is it from a typical tenor voice.  Powerfully controlled, his dark near-baritone boom makes his Cavaradossi here totally unlike Marcelo Alvarez or indeed any how any other classic tenor would perform the role. There is a fear that with such a powerful voice he could end up bellowing the words, particularly as there is ample opportunity for it, but Kaufmann retains complete control over the voice and the character, dropping it to quieter phrasing where it is required. I'm not totally convinced by the heroic nature of his performance here, which doesn't let in a great deal of humanity, but I suppose that's how Puccini mainly scores the role.<br /><br />Bryn Terfel likewise has to make the most of how Scarpia is scored and try to strike a balance between a human and a caricature. He also sings wonderfully and certainly looks the part with enough physical presence and steel in his vocal delivery to make the evil pronouncements of the Chief of Police, heavily underscored as they are by Puccini, more than menacing enough, so the additional grimaces and sneers perhaps aren't all that necessary. The singing performances are all marvellous then, making the most of the roles and trying to find some balance and level of humanity in the characters - which isn't always easy in this opera - but best of all is how well they work together. On a vocal level the singing is perfectly complementary and there appears to be no struggle for dominance on the acting side either, each of them existing within their own characters but working with each other well. It makes it very easy then for the viewer to become wrapped up in themelodramatic events that occur over the 24 hour period of the story.<br /><br />That's as much to do with the staging however, so while you can criticise Jonathan Kent's lack of imagination in the production design and the stage direction, it does at least work effectively on a dramatic level. Part of the reason for this is the decision not to downplay the opera's controversial depictions of violence. Make no mistake, it's all there in the libretto, from the extended torture scene through to the attempted rape, murder and executions, but some directors might choose to underplay these elements, particularly to mitigate against Puccini's full-blooded score. It's a difficult balance to maintain, and there's certainly no right or wrong way to do it. If you are aiming for realism in the set designs and you have singers who are also good actors, then it makes sense to let them fully enter into the roles and the cast here manage to do that without too much grimacing and operatic mannerisms. Matched with a perfectly judged performance of the Royal Opera House orchestra under Antonio Pappano, the result is an impressive, involving and near perfect account of Puccini's \\"shabby little shocker\\" as you could expect to see done anywhere in the world today.melodramatic events that occur over the 24 hour period of the story.<br /><br />That's as much to do with the staging however, so while you can criticise Jonathan Kent's lack of imagination in the production design and the stage direction, it does at least work effectively on a dramatic level.
