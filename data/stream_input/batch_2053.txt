B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app if you like to take care of horses and feed them. etc. i love to come on it everyday
1416550550|3.0|I actually liked the story line enough to get through this book, but it is long and I believe wasn't worth the time and effort. The payoff in the end fell short of my expectations.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|James puts on paper what men dream about and usually never live in reality. Thumbs up, Mr James. Keep it up
0439023491|1.0|I am still asking myself why I ever wanted to read this book. It was worse than the first book in the series. To me it seemed like a rehash of the action from the first book and was written not because the author had a story to tell, but rather, the author/publisher could sell more books. A complete waste of time!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out and loved it.  I laughed hysterically and wept while watching this movie.  It has a great balance of humor and deeper emotions with a great message.  highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|ive just started to play it so far its kinda interesting .although it seems like it would get boring after a few days of playing it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved the story, a tad bit slow at the beginning, but just a great story.<br />Now saying that I believe it would finish the story, if the author finished<br />Louisa Clark's life story.
B006MPKE9O|5.0|Intriguing mystery which will keep readers spellbound to the very end.<br />Set in a fascinating atmosphere of a know distant past of Barcelona. Highly recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I am about 3/4 of the way done with &#34;Hopeless&#34; interesting twist I didn't expect! Can't wait to see how it all plays out!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|sometimes I run into trouble with songs skipping or not playing at all. although lately it's been playing well. I quess vevo llc has made some progress.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I thought I had &#34;properly&#34; recorded the season 3 episodes with my home DVR but when I tried to watch them, after having finally caught up with all of season 1 and 2, I realized that although the episode said downton abbey it was actually another show! I was frustrated so I searched and found that I could watch the missing episodes through amazon, I was thrilled. It was easy to order and of course I was able to instantly view the show. The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 was because I had a difficult time locating the season 3 episodes. When i searched Season 3 not all the episodes available instantly came up, I had to search several different ways to get the correct episodes.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|This is a fun and exciting movie. The actors were great and were enjoyable to watch.  I definitely recommend it. The price was good and the delivery was fast.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wasn't expecting parts in the ending but very pleased! Great series. :) couldn't put the book down, def re-read these again!
B004HMQ7BI|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater & have been looking for it online for a few years, I was thrilled when I found it on IMDB & was able to rent it thru Amazon. I love all the actors in it, love the scenery, it's a feel good romantic comedy. Love it! Wish they'd make more like it now a days instead of all the profanity laced sex crazed movies they try to pass off as romantic comedies.
0812993292|5.0|What a lovely story. Maybe it's unlikely that any of us would set out, without thinking, on a 500 mile walk-a-thon in a pair of deck shoes, but nevertheless, the \\"journey\\" is real. We all have those memories that can taunt us like demons, and if we don't face them, they'll let their presence be known in one form or another. This is what happens for Harold and Maureen. I can not recommend this book enough for those who, like me, are in that stage of life where you're \\"all grown up\\" but still don't know what you're doing; you see your children no longer needing you; wonder what's lying ahead in years to come; still looking back at conversations unfinished...<br /><br />For me, this what a quick read (I'm a slow reader, so even quicker for most of you, I'm sure) and a book I could not put down. Also, a rare ending that didn't disappoint me!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this game in addition to the first while my kids nap. A great way to just have some down time.
B00867GHS8|5.0|arrived fast and who doesn't love fishes!! fish are friends not food!! awesome movie. I would watch over and over again!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Funny, witty and laugh out loud good. If you want to have a different perspective on the ordinary I suggest you take a trip through this book. Don't misunderstand, there are some jewels of deep thought that will cause reflection but then you will turn the page to be surprised by a belly laugh. I highly recommend.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|This is one of my 7-yr-old's favorite movies.  We all find it really funny and very well-written.  This movie has such a great line-up of actors too, and it doesn't disappoint.  We've watched it a dozen times easily.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|A great game for adults and kids.We have played it on Kindle Fires for WEEKS now without encountering a problem. Lots of fun!!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The acting, the setting and the story are all superb. The travails of Downton Abbey puts its hooks into one and does not let go!
B005ZUR724|5.0|I don't play many online games but this one rocks! it works really good to no glitches that ive dealt with. works really well with my kindle fire. love the scenery to :)
B000000HRP|5.0|Brand X was a great band filled with amazing players and Unorthodox Behavior was their first album. Brand X came to fusion from rock, but unlike many rock bands who experimented with jazz, these guys had impressive chops. John Goodsall is one of my favourite guitarists and was one of the fastest players on the planet in his heyday. Unfortunately Brand X emerged on the UK scene in 1976, when punk and new wave were just starting to change the music scene. The great British public wasn't in the mood for this level of virtuosity. In their photos they sported long hair and beards, but the hippie look was no longer fashionable. The band was never \\"cool\\" in their homeland. The album failed to chart in the UK but reached #191 in the U.S. If only Brand X had emerged 3 or 4 years earlier.<br /><br />This is a great jazz-rock album, as good as anything released by Weather Report or Return to Forever. The compositions are great and the band is jointly credited for all the music. The musicians play with great speed, energy and enthusiasm. This album provides evidence that Phil Collins was at one time a very good drummer. Percy Jones on bass and Robin Lumley on keyboards complete the line-up. Jones was an incredible bass player who played with Eno, Soft Machine, Steve Hackett, David Sylvian, Roy Harper, and Suzanne Vega.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have a couple of promnles with the templerun2 it is really slow it was 2 min and 56sec for it to load I really need help I played temple run before when ever I. want to slid it jumps it is the opisite when u run really cool but readicalis
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the game was fun and challenging.  Good mix of puzzles and hidden objects.  High recommendation on this game.  Waiting for a follow on game.  Good story line.  Kept my interest.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Great album. All that is missing is a track with Eminem. Not sure why that didn't happen. Maybe on Em's next album.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have tried several other sound apps to help me sleep a bit better.some were great, others not so much. White Noise is all I could ask for. the sounds are crystal clear and there is little to no breaks that will jar you from slumber.
0385535147|5.0|I've read most of Grisham's novels and I'm one of the few reviewers who think his writing gets better and better. I loved The Liquidators, The Confession and Calico Joe, and enjoyed The Racketeer just as much. Great fun reading entertainment, with a lot of intelligence and classy style.<br /><br />I see a lot of Amazon reviewers complain that a lawyer who gets a 10 yr. prison sentence plots his way out of prison, puts one over on the feds with a chance to end up with a pot of gold would be too unbelievable, sometimes I did too while reading, however I kept thinking this lawyer Malcolm Bannister spent years in prison plotting just how to do this. I loved the suspense, as I wasn't sure if he would get away with it in the end...I do remember reading The Partner, which I loved too.<br /><br />I often think Grisham writes a book like a movie script, but what's wrong with that? Will Smith as Malcolm/Max, Halle Berry as Vanessa Young. Solid 5 stars!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I 1st off..... like this game very much. the controls are easy to use... you get many different blocks...... there are some animals (cow, pig, sheep, chicken) and once in a while you'll get a lava fall.<br /><br />now.... what I don't like about this.......<br /><br />for what this game can do...witch is very limeted.... this game is pricey. $7.00 American money.<br />there are no signs, minecarts, caves, wolves, cats, ect... so I would say update the game and include those things. also... multiple times.. when I've tried to mine anything other that coal.... it wont give me the block...... therefore.... what I make is limeted. in creative..... there are no.animals...... at all..... no mobs.... ect.. so again.... I would suggest changing that.<br /><br />I also wish there was a way to spawn creepers and animals and such on creative mode.<br /><br />thanks for taking the time to listen to me. I hope the game gets updated soon.<br /><br />  flare wolfy
B00846REIS|4.0|Loved the book. Was addicted from the beginning.  It was a little similar to fifty shades, but was different enough to keep my interest.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent book. One of those you can't put down, don't want to put down until it's finished. It seems so real. Kudos to the author!!
B000T433L0|5.0|I've heard about this movie over and over again. I finally took the time to watch it. Awesome movie!! Robert De Niro is fantastic in the film. Rent this movie, you will not be disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent read. I would recommend ths book to anyone who loves excitement. I adore the author's imagination. Never a dull moment. Read the first one as well.  Reading this one now, I'm almost done reading it. :(
B004I744AS|5.0|I thought it was just a dictonary, but it,s more than that. I love playing hangman with my granddaughter and words within words is fun also. I'm reading a Scotish book series and believe me it has help alot. Glad I purchased this app. actually I think it was free.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|His timing was phenomenal any was clearly talented beyond many in the industry from day 1 born to be an entertainer and performed his role perfectly.
0765325950|5.0|I will say that I wish Robert Jordan could have finished the series himself but I am grateful that he loved his fans enough to ensure that there would be an ending to this epic story even if someone else had to finish it for him. It is obvious that this book was not written by Jordan, and that made me a little sad (sanderson has a very different writing style), but for those who feel he was too long winded with his descriptions I suppose that will be an improvement. I myself loved that stuff and felt that characters were more fleshed out under his pen. Fair warning to those who don't like reading about battles; over half of the book is the last battle being fought on multiple fronts. Honestly I didn't really like the ending at first, but rereading it made me realize it was probably the best possible ending even if it leaves you wanting to know a little more. It's the kind that makes you have to draw your own conclusions, but not in a bad way. Thank you Brandon Sanderson for doing the best you could to honor Jordan's memory.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it sometimes it is frustrating then u get it and ur like what now and ur awesome and win.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Loved this game. So its better then the old one. Pretty well  the same as the old one except the graphics are better and they added more fun stuff on it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a cute little game for someone who wants a horse and are unable to have one .<br />I recommend this app for children of all ages.
B00007EDY5|5.0|This is the best flash synch port solution for newer cameras with only a hotshue.  AS-15v functions perfectly with my Canon cameras.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Lots of action, but not anything very new in the series involving Jack Ryan other than all getting old. Easy read but not worth the money.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game! can't wait for the next one to come out. hope it is as good as the first one. keep up the good work.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|This one was difficult to use, could never get it to work right. The controls are hard to figure out and use.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Even if you edit out all the various tenses of the &#34;f&#34; word it would still be objectionable.  How did this ridiculous book ever make the best seller list!  Is it possible to return this Kindle Book?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Liked the first. Ending was too fast for climax. Enjoyed reading somewhat too political  Liked the twist at the end
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So much to do with it! This app is an extremely useful app that helps keep you organized and can be synced with other devices. I've synced it between my Kindle and cell phone and it works great! I'd like to sync it to my laptop, but haven't yet, so I don't know how that works. Great app!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and much easier to shuffle and deal than with real cards. Also nicer to play this in a moving car!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's books are great reads and he develops his characters and story lines seamlessly. His Mitch Rapp series of novels are great if you like fast moving books that are detailed with current or past world affairs that impact us all. I have read all of his books and have loved every one of them.
B003TH14H4|5.0|My daughter loves this show!  She constantly begs for a new season while re watching the older shows on her kindle.
B001MSMULG|5.0|This is a book that holds your interest from the first page to the last.  It reads quickly and the main characters are very interesting and intriguing.  Daniel Silva is a wonderful story teller so if you are looking for a great read this is a book you should consider.
B003THHIEM|5.0|My daughter loves this show!  She constantly begs for a new season while re watching the older shows on her kindle.
B000ELJBAK|4.0|Those expecting another Pink Floyd album run a risk of being disappointed but those who want to hear more of Mr. Gilmour's superb guitar work and soothing vocals are in for a treat. That is not to say it doesn't have Floydian moments but its clear that this is a true solo album and attempts something different from his work as a band. Gilmour's guitar is as soaring and emotive as any of his work in Pink Floyd and are expressed carefully powerfully. While his lyrics are no were near the caliber of Roger Water's works they serve their purpose and are moving in their simplicity. Overall the album is very good on its own and offers a good glimpse at the contributions Gilmour made towards Pink Floyd. This along with David Gilmour's On An Island are worth a good listen for any fan of Pink Floyd and a must for any fan of David Gilmour's legendary guitar work
B00B2V66VS|3.0|when i first downloaded it, it was very fun but when i played it again it keep stoping i really want to play it again.  :(
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A book that keeps you thinking about your own use of time. Loved it beyond my expectations and couldn't put it down.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the app. I think that it needs more characters to make the game more fun. seriously recommend it
B006LSZECO|5.0|An unstoppable fast paced thriller I couldn't put down. Read it in two days. Loved it and felt like I was in the book.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|When my daughter found out that he was coming out with a new album she was begging me to pre order it. I said No we'll get it after it comes into stores, she was really disappointed because shes  a HUGE Belieber has to have everything that he comes out with. So In the beginning of January while my daughter was at school I preordered it and then when she came home from school today I made her go to her room and the Amazon box was on her bed, she opened it and screamed once she saw it. She's listening to it right now and I must say it's really good, he's a very talented boy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest.  Easy to use on my Kindle Fire, great color/graphics. Very easy to navigate. I love it!!
031606792X|5.0|I especially like the free downloads for my family to try before we decide whether of not to purchase them.
630542845X|5.0|great movie, I highly recommend it to anyone, interested in something a little out of the box as they say
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! I recommend this book to children and young readers. I like this book cause it made me laugh a lot.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game a lot. My name is Xel'Naga island. My Storm8 ID is FrenziedFurling if you wanna request me. I cant get enough of it. Oh im level 46
B000VBJEEG|1.0|We love the movie Ratatouille. We were sad when we noticed that the DVD was missing from our collection of movies so we decided to look at Amazon to get a copy. We looked at the used copies because the new ones are still @ $20. So we looked at the used ones. We found on that said Condition: Used - Good for $6.86. We ordered it. It came in when expected and with much anticipation we opened it so we could watch it that night, only to see an incredible amount of scratches on the disk. I was shocked. I could accept a couple, but it looked like it was on the floor of a car in the back seat for 6 months.  We tried to watch it any way and got through 30 minutes with only a few pixelated moments and a couple stutters. Then it happened. It started stalling for 3 seconds, then 5 seconds then it froze.  As far as rating the movie itself, I give it a 5 star! but the quality... I have ordered a lot from Amazon, I am very disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Although this series appealed to the masses, it indicates what a mess this world is in. Everyone likes a little lust and sexual excitement but this series went way too far.
0451169514|5.0|I am writting this review even though I have read the book several times. I am a SK fan because I like to enjoy a book for a long time. I get pleasure in staring into my mind while someone else draws a picture. I am still shocked that people are reading this book for the first time. I often think the writers of the show \\"Lost\\" imitated SK writing style and a lot of people say that. Remember when reading this book and most of his books that they are about the characters. The situation drives the characters actions but they take a backseat to the story of the characters themselves. IT is a horror novel but the novel is about children in a horrible situation forced to destroy an ancient evil that has plauged Derry for .... ever. It is a long story because it goes past their childhood and into their adulthood.<br /><br />The movie did IT justice but there was so much more to it. After finishing the book watch the movie and it will be obvious (hopefully) that somethings should not be acted out and understand that it would be a LONG movie. Gone are the days that people will sit in a theatre and watch a movie that has an intermition. I do not think this is his best book because I loved the darktower to much to say that. That being said I always come back to IT! I always want to read about the turtle and the magic that it has to link people together. If you like this book try Dreamcatcher after. I feel it is similar and enjoy it for the same reasons.<br /><br />I am the egg man!
B000FC13E0|4.0|What is so scary is that the story line is not all that far fetched.It takes you from everyday to creepy in the blink of an eye.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is an incredible movie and absolutely love the ending of this historic franchise.<br /><br />I own and iPad, iPhone, and many other devices but I can not stand the Ultraviolet digital copy stuff. I requires a constant internet access when I don't have a constant internet connection on my devices, especially when I'm traveling. I truly wished this service would go away and everyone would just use the iTunes digital copy so that I can actually download this movie to my device and truly &#34;own&#34; it. Ultraviolet = renting.
B003Y8YXEO|5.0|i love this cd.  it is hard to find and can't seem to find it at all at retail stores.  the music is great and i love to listen to it.  anyone who is a john lennon fan should love this cd.  i recommend it highly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the most AMAZING game I have ever played!Plus it's FREE and really addicting. Another good thing about this game is it makes you to keep going non-stop to whet  you might not stop...LOL.<br /><br />I Highly recommend this games to anyone who is competitive and likes to do tasks!!<br />  HOPE THIS HELPED YOU!!  :D
B009TO99TG|5.0|Coldplay is awesome.  So not sure what else I can say about this.  Other then if you like Coldplay it a great value
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. it is better then the first and I didn't think that could be posable. thanks Imangi studios
B0073B587E|2.0|The guitar is good, but you can download songs fails, with only one song not worth the guitar, NOT recommend it until they can download songs
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Amazon should not force us to writre more than we want to on on the reviews, there should be an opt out if we do not want to leave a review at all!
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|I seen the program on PBS many yrs ago and loved it,  what a treasure to have in my library.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Amazon should not force us to writre more than we want to on on the reviews, there should be an opt out if we do not want to leave a review at all!
B001TP698C|5.0|I have the DVD for several yrs, and what treasure to have them on my  portable systems.  Progressive music is YES, so why aren't they in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For shame!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Hilarious movie would recommend to mature audience. I couldn't stop laughing. 5 stars I hope there's a 2nd movie later on
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|First time reviewing anything on amazon at all. Absolutely enjoyed this film from start to finish. Such a dynamic and beautiful story. Love Jiro's work ethic, subdued grace and humor.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|get right away. its awesome, fun, cool, and has tuns of suprises.Its all iv been playing. Me and my sister love it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I literally could not put this book - or the other two in the series - down until i finished it.
B007WTR2W6|2.0|I didnt get any interest while reading this book. Ideas are very broad in meaning. Overall just a time pass
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I finally read all three book in this trilogy.  I couldn't put them down.  This book was as good as the first in the series and as good as the last in the series.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good book.
B00005JKNC|5.0|I love this movie. My girlfriend cried at some parts. The dvd has a excellent picture quality and it arrived early. Thanks
B00992CF6W|5.0|Despite the fact that Minecraft Pocket Edition doesn't, and won't any time in the very near future just so anyone wanting to have caves and such in the Pocket Edition and begs for it all the time on twitter knows, have randomly generated world structures or lager worlds, mainly just because the iPhones and Android phones won't be able to handle such huge amounts of memory being taken up, it is a very good game. No, this is not regular Minecraft. No, this is not the release. No, this is not the ONLY edition of Minecraft out there. Minecraft Pocket Edition is a very fun game to just muck around with and build things, along with surviving the evil that comes out at night and in the dark. All in all, this is a very great game. Everyone who is impatient for an update, just tune into Jens Bergenstein on Twitter, and he'll shout out when the next update will be, or you could get on minecraftforum.net, the official English Minecraft forums. Mojang talks about updates and custom maps daily, so stay tuned. Also, one of the pictures is Survivalcraft, not Minecraft.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|Even though I like this movie, the dvd is warped and will not play well. It makes noises and I found that the disk is scratched. Not happy with this purchase
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app rocks if you like any kind of temple run then you need to get this it has ziplines and gems well basically what I have to say is get this app or your missing out on something amazing.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I had been waiting with many others for years for this to finally come out. I was not disappointed I was simply amazed. I highly recommend the Blu-ray edition if you have the player for it. The quality is stunning and the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This isn't LOTR, but it is a very good series. I bought this for my brother for Christmas as he had never seen it but wanted to, and when he was done my boyfriend and I watched the series. We all enjoyed it. Personally, it reminded me of The Tudors if you have ever seen it, except it was definitely geared more towards men in that there is fighting and gore and a lot less romance. Though, there is enough of the element of both violence, love, and war to make it an incredible series for any couple to share. Definitely worth buying!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Best solution for getting your home media from the computer to a variety of screens.  Has a roku channel as well.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|While not the same as the original in terms of human story depth, this movie still rocks. Action is amazing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. This book takes quite a few unexpected twists and turns. I would definitely recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! it is so much fun. I love how it has the  zippline. it os great when ur just sitting there with nothing to do u can just grab it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire .Great game for free. I play it all the time. Reminds me of my childhood playing with my Grandma.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Series was intense. It really show a strong development of the characters, and the turmoil of survival they faced. Special effects like the previous seasons was outstanding.  A lot of adult content, so not for the weak hearted or for the small school kids. definitely the best quality zombie series I ever seen
B008ELUEQC|5.0|WE HAVE ALWAYS LIKED ROD STEWART AND HE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB AGAIN. THIS CHRISTMAS CD IS SO WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO. IT REALLY KEEPS YOU IN THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best possible way to get information.<br />There are many articles and facts just waiting to be read and enjoyed.<br />I truly like using this app.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great for list makers like me. I highly recommend it. Also try the other apps that tie in -  like Snitch.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I love this film... me and the roommates have already purchased this one on iTunes, but decided after watching it repeatedly that the higher quality bluray would be worth it.<br /><br />and it was.<br /><br />The film is not for the faint of heart, though.  There is blood.  If you have seen any of Tarantino's other works, however, this should not come as a surprise.
B000005RPX|5.0|I received this CD yesterday, I like it.<br />Contains 3 CDs at an affordable price.<br />Contains songs in different version.<br />Some songs are from the album Made In Japan.
B000024ZVL|5.0|I'm a deep purple fan, I collected most of their albums from the beginning.<br />This is also a great album, eventhough I'm not already familiar with the songs.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Great lightweight watch. Everyone comments and both men & women. Say they'd like to own.Keeps good time. I have a small wrist , perhaps a smaller band would be offered...
B009GGWX5E|5.0|I first bought this album and I liked it.  But for me this is too short for a live album.<br />So I read the reviews, some customers mentioned &#34;This time around - Live in tokyo&#34; is better compared to this album.<br />So I searched it and bought it also.<br />So now I owned both copies.<br />This one and the &#34;This time around live in tokyo album&#34;.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|The development of Reacher was complete some books ago and this book is in my view a perfect Reacher story. The &#34;perfect&#34; streak actually begins with 61 hours -- I look forward to taking some time off and reading them all in sequence, from 61 hours and onwards.
B000024KRO|5.0|I'm not familiar with the songs in this album, but it sounds great, just like the old albums of Deep Purple.<br />Love this album
B001NHNG64|1.0|If you haven't read any Reacher novel yet, don't start with this one. What you have here is not Reacher, not by a long shot, but some colorless and badly drawn prototype -- and the writing is bad too. It's amazing. It's all bad, the entire thing, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />The later Reacher books are however wonderful. You migth for instance start with 61 hours, which is a hell of a ride, and work your way forward.<br /><br />You might also look at The Enemy for a wonderful first-person narrative.
B000024LX9|5.0|I collected almost all studio albums of Deep Purple, right now, I'm collectiong their live albums.<br />This Live album is great.<br />Two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't put the book down! Such a great continuation and so many unexpected turns! Can't wait to read the last one
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The worst book I have ever tried to read...so much so that I could not even finish reading it and deleted it immediately.  A true waste of my money and time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great entertaiement,  it makes you want to continue to next level and to the next. I could not stop playing it
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It is on back order, but I am sure everything will be fine.  Look forward to receiving it as I saw the movie at the theater.
B006RXQ8RI|2.0|I finally gave up watching because of the bad quality of the video feed. The bits I saw were quite good.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|This was a really cute romance and different from most movies of this kind.  Very enjoyable and a marvelous cast.
B00136JS12|5.0|One of the defining albums of classic rock. Boston produced a unique sound and a collection of songs that could not be duplicated, even by them. The songs epitomize guitar and vocal driven rock. Some of the songs have timeless lyrics, especially Peace of Mind.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Good movie, arrived on time in good shape, reasonable price,  no problems, and I like being able to track the package.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Very short story with basically no conclusion, and the share thing after the box of stars with no instructions what it meant for.

B00006CXSS|2.0|Hello,<br />We love the Band of Brothers Series, however, we received 2 disks #3 instead of a disk #2.  Can this be corrected?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is just as good, if not better than the first. It keeps you on your toes and just itching to turn the page. If you like the hunger games, then you'll love catching fire.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I'd totally forgotten how wonderful the Holmes stories are.  Recommend it to anyone who's into murder and mystery.  And, you can't beat the price!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the series, would absolutely recommend to everyone! Love that I can access my videos on amazon. The Walking Dead is a surprising and  addicting series!
1609611543|5.0|Never thought she would but my wife kicked a 30 plus year smoking habit in Mid September and reminded me my promise to lose weight.Thought she might relapse but she did not so how was I going to hold up to my end of the bargain?  I saw a 75 year old Kaiser clinic doctor at end of December for a stiff neck which he issued medicine .He saw my girth (280 pounds) told me I probably hadsleep aeopnia pointed to my gut and said \\"Wheat Belly\\" suggesting My gut was from wheat and to get the book.  He saidhe lost 80 pounds just eliminating wheat ..yea right.  I read snippets from the book on Amazon and contemplated giving the no wheat regimin a try.  Trip to Kaiser on January 10th still tipping the scale at 280 I decided to get the book and give the no wheat non diet a try. Had the wheatectomy that very day.  Book came a few days later and I had hard time putting it down. I was surprised I did not have a wheat woody that the book said was entirely possible and I ( actually my wife ) noticed the effects of going no wheat almost immediately.  She said I stopped flailing, kicking and thrashing in my sleep ( we have large body pillow between us so I don't bruise her ) and I have slept all through the night  for the last couple of weeks , and that has not happened in years.  I lost the constant urge to munch after every meal  up till the time I went to bed..and often later.  Two weeks later belt was looser (size 46 at start) and wife cried when she was able to touch her fingertips when giving me a hug!  On Jan. 25th went to Kaiser (again) to get my annual epidural shot in the buttocks (lower back) for constant lower back pain from a fall years ago.  Back pain had subsided considerably but still need the shot which lasts me about a year.  Anyway, got weighed on same scale as15 days earlier and was stunned to weigh in a 262 pounds...an 18 pound loss in 2 weeks...amazing.  Don't think this is water weight because I take hydrochlorothiazide ( diuretic)  for my high blood pressure..one of 6 oral meds for HBP, cholosterol, and diabetes...plus a shot of insulin.<br />I still have some sugars..yogurt, ice cream (no wheat...duh) but blood glucose has not spiked like with wheat and I have had to cut my insulin intake in half!  Still have not-as-huge gut sosugars will still be high until that goes away hopefully in near future.<br />Book is technical with losts of big medical words but  more is sinking in on second read through.What he preaches (very well) is essentially cutting carbs like the Atkins diet demands but this book goes into why wheat is bad for ealth ..besides giving us all a Wheat Belly.<br />Update: Feb. 2 2013<br />Lost another 7 pounds this week.  Insulin use cut to more than half.  Have not been this light in about 4 years.  Still no urges for wheat....but love my pizza.  Dominoes has a gluten free crust pizza that is pretty good.  If you get a regular thin crust pizza which has a crust thinner than a cracker, it is easy tp scrape all the goodies off and leave the crust.  Still having some sugars with fruits and a little ice cream few times a week with no spike in sugars like after eating wheat.  Love the Mary's gone Crackers that the book suggests.  They have at least 5 flavors and are great by themselves or with cheese. Made with whole grains(not wheat) and seeds.  Yum.  They make cookies too but have not given them a try. Got them at Sprouts.  Have not seen them at regular grocery stores yet.  Lost all this weight without exercise but going back to the gym now that I don't feel like a slug anymore.<br />Update:Feb 10 2013<br />I have been diabetic for about 8 years with my A1C ranging from 8.3 to 10.8 getting tested about twice a year.  Sept. 2012 A1C was  8.6. Got tested today and it wass 7.3 !!!! only after 1 month of being wheat free.  Also lost about 30 pounds..  I am almost out of diabetic ramge of over 7.0of 6 oral meds for HBP, cholosterol, and diabetes...plus a shot of insulin.<br />I still have some sugars..yogurt, ice cream (no wheat...duh) but blood glucose has not spiked like with wheat and I have had to cut my insulin intake in half!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is pretty fun. So many different games to choose from. Hard to get bored with that's for sure :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing.Its just like temple run but better.You can still get magnets and stuff.But instead of a shield you get a hoverboard.I also recamend temple run 2
B008IJTFYW|4.0|works great with a fussy newborn. I take it with me everywhere n it helps put n keep her asleep.
1596177373|3.0|I wanted this card deck because I was a fan of Tim Burton, but I expected it to have more various drawings than only four.<br />And it does not really work as a real deck of cards for the material is very flimsy so it starts to crack after a round of game and some of the cards were stained red for some reason.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is pretty fun.  I enjoy the new graphics and gameplay.  The minecart is a great addition!  Definitely a good purchase.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Its a good story but seems to drag on forever. I guess it's just not my type of book as I couldn't get into the story. It was complicated with too many different characters and I never really understood the plot. A strange story that just wasn't for me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again.  A great story with a wonderful ending.  Keeps your attention and you don't want to put it down.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I enjoy keeping up with friends and family on Facebook, but it keeps changing and most of us do not appreciate that.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a great Steven King movie.  I am not a Tim Robbins fan, however, he is excellent in this movie
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Been a while since I read it, but it had an interesting story line about young relationships. It can be read by all ages.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Unbelievable for a free game. First is the graphics are so clean and even with the quality set to max the gameplay remains smooth and responsive. The other thing is after playing for approx 3hrs total so far i can say i see no signs that this game will FORCE me to spend real money. I love this game. Top five best free game ive played on my  kindle. .... So came back with an edit and took away 2 stars and here it is. While everything i said i stand by, the fact is that 6 months after my review is that after about a month of playing this game the repetiveness of this runner resulted in i haven't played it once in the last 5 months so i will say good game maybe ill play it some more in the future. Maybe i won\\"t.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time!  Can't wait to read her next one!  Couldn't put it down.  Definite page-turner.
030758836X|4.0|Wow. That was some crazy, dark humor and dysfunction. Loved the character development and pacing of the novel.  Not what I expected at all by reading the general description. I want to see the Cohen brothers make this into a movie.  I will definitely read more by this author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good way to listen to Michael Savage on Pandora in the background while spending the hours .  A quick response app that is also very basic.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It does what it said it would, and is pretty simple and cute... The 'Upgrade now!' Popup constantly appearing is a bit much, though.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I liked the book and excited for the movie to come out. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it is basically a book about short stories.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|As a person who enjoys playing chess, but has no one to play with this has turned out to be a fun and challenging app.  I recommend this app for people who enjoy chess and don't have a good set of their own. It stores easier too!
B0089XH38M|4.0|Basic security. Nothing fancy. No fancy frills or options to choose. It does what it says and that's it. Plain vanilla!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I like this game. My friend says this game gives her the weirdest cravings for diarrhea. She can't help but stuff her face with... well you know what I was gonna say. But I really do hope she stops eating diarrhea so much cause then she throws up, and then mixes it with cat urine and drinks it.  She sometimes even tops it off with a huge slimy dog turd! I am only telling you this cause she told me to tell you, and she is not ashamed of herself!
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I wanted to like it, I really did. I liked the premise, I thought it would be a fun little romance book to read. Instead it comes off as repetitve and boring. It never really feels plalusible at all.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game, but my best friend wishes she could clean their poo!  My friend is way weird, and I wish she would just accept the way the game is!! But oh well I think it's a great game and you should definitely get it!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I heard a lot of gr8 things about the show so when I saw it on Kindle Prime I checked in! I was hooked! The acting is fantastic, the English greenery is beautiful and that house! Did people really live like that? Those women didn't even brush their own hair! I'm totally invested in all the characters! Love it!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game but my friend says she wants them to make another one where the person poops the whole time he is running! Gross right? She is very strange, but this game is a must get!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast paced.  Clever.  I was rooting for him all the way and glad that justice was finally done.  Another Grisham gem.
0307949486|5.0|I really loved how strong and silent Lisbeth Solander's character was. Usually you see this in males, like Clint Eastwood in Spaghetti westerns, other fantasy genre...or anywhere really. She's super intelligent and massively misunderstood with a chip on her shoulder from an abusive childhood. But what made me love her is she never plays the victim, and never lets anyone get away with it. All the characters were welcome, kind of like life, you didn't know who you could trust. The men for the most part, were not the best, except for a few. I think that was the author's intent. It made the reader understand and root for Lisbeth. And the having it be smart, dark with an old crime to be solved made it even yummier.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first Temple Run was awesome. I was instantly addicted the first time I played it. Once I unlocked all the characters and power ups, though, there wasn't much point in playing.  I kept wanting an update to be released that would add more levels or power ups or something to make it fresh and exciting again.<br /><br />Enter Temple Run 2.  Temple Run 2 takes the same simple play format and really super-charges it. It's everything a sequel should be: better graphics, new power ups, more interesting game play. Better everything! I really can't believe what a great job Imangi did on this game. I can now proudly say that I'm happy to be a Temple Run addict again!
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|It syncs to the cloud from my PC  - but not from my Kindle Fire HD, so not worth much as an app.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|annoying so much  i wish it would have been the right size for my screen i really am upset with this performance
B000WC4A8O|5.0|Ok, I needed some Zep for my vinyl collection and it is hard to get new copies on vinyl. Enter the Mothership. Now, it would be easy to rant about the tracks included, but hey, to make me happy the entire catalog would have to be included! I do wish some of the lesser known tracks such as &#34;In My Time of Dying&#34; and the like were included, but the collection as it sits is great. Records sound great, I've had no problems there.
B006X415GK|5.0|I was really bummed that the other grayscale Frankie was expensive and hard to find. So, I was VERY happy when this much more affordable version came out. I had a Toys R' Us gift card and I ordered it as soon as I saw it because I KNOW the price of this one is going to go up. Of course making any Mattel item a different color automatically makes scalpers buy them all and sell them for 10 times the regular price, even though the doll is just a regular Monster High toy. She should cost about 10 to 20 dollars, so DON'T pay some rip-off price! The doll only comes with the clothing she is wearing and a black doll stand. No extra accessories are added, so be aware of this before buying.<br /><br />I make doll clothing and furniture as a hobby so I am always looking for unique dolls to inspire me. I have to say, I was really impressed when I received this doll in the mail! She is TOTALLY gorgeous and even prettier than in the pictures. The photo here on Amazon is an accurate one but it doesn't fully capture the beauty of the doll. She actually looks much better in natural light and in person. Especially when I held her up to my other normally colored Frankie doll, I realized just how cool she looks. Both versions of the doll are pretty but the grayscale one is amazing when you first open it and look at it up close. It is JUST like seeing an old Black & White monster movie!<br /><br />Frankie's outfit is a black and silver swimsuit with a matching bikini wrap. The bikini wrap is removable and the swimsuit underneath is a connected halter one-piece style which is black on top and metallic silver fabric on the bottom. The top and the wrap are black with a gray and silver storm cloud and lightning print. The shoes, bracelet and earrings are gray and slightly opaque with a matte surface. The stitching on Frankie's body is painted on with black and silver and the lipstick is a metallic steel gray color. Frankie's eyes are both gray BUT one is a slightly lighter gray and the other darker, suggesting they are mismatched just like the original Frankie (the original colored doll has one blue eye and one green eye because all her body parts probably come from different people) and I found this tiny detail cute. This Frankie version is made to look like the one from \\"Skull Shores\\" and it is a very accurate rendition of the way she looked in the cartoon. The color of the doll DOES actually relate to the \\"Skull Shores\\" plot but you have to see the cartoon to understand.<br /><br />A few people did complain about the stiff hair but as a collector and someone who likes to dress the dolls and take photos, I actually DO understand why they do this to the hair. The boxes get tossed around a lot during shipping. Long hair can be sewn or secured into the package but short or curly hair can be a WRECK once you get the toy out of the box! To prevent this, they put a thick coating of \\"hair gel\\" to preserve the short and slightly flipped-under hairdo. If you want to take good photos, many dolls need the hair washed and re-set. There are tons of Monster High hair tutorials online and it is so easy, kids are making most of the how-to videos. With this doll, all I had to do was rinse the hair in warm water, blot it dry with a towel, reshape it and leave it to dry undisturbed overnight. The result was a hairstyle that looked exactly like the cartoon and mine didn't need any extra trimming or styling.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great toy! As far as durability, I will just say this: It's a Monster High doll, so handle it with care! As many parents have probably discovered, they are not the most durable toy. They also have body parts that come off, making them a poor choice for very small children. If you are a parent, heed the warning labels and note the age recommendations. If you are a collector or a hobbyist, have a spare doll for measuring, trying clothing on and trying out poses. Too much wear and tear and the joints get loose and parts start to fall off randomly. My first Cleo doll is so wobbly she droops like a wet noodle when you try to stand her up. The joints of this Frankie doll seem to be a little tighter but I guess time will tell. She is beautiful, I have made a lot of cool stuff for her and as far as the \\"fun\\" factor she gets five stars! Even more fun was the fact I got this doll for the right price. Maybe Mattel IS finally getting a clue and making enough dolls for everyone. Let's hope so! For now, this doll is still pretty easy to find online.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is fun and addictive. Its a great sequel and gives the player lots of new features. Only fault I found was it sometimes doesn't play on my Kindle Fire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|graet game just wish it had minecarts and armor and maybe a bigger world otherwise its an awesome game its not a ripoff though.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|dredd is a baddass, he is an emotionless murder machine but thats alright for the kind of movie this is.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|I can definitely see why this movie is hailed as one of the greatest films of the 20th century - amazing cinematography, great acting (which is somewhat unusual for the time period) and the story is beautiful, a timeless classic.
B004V5QWU2|3.0|The app is good but every 10 seconds or so it skips for a fraction of a second. it is not much but it is noticeable. If the skip was fixed this app may be a 5!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a weird book mostly because of the chicken pox and how Greg doesn't get a girl to the dance and he ruins it for the girl I really think it was a good book I just could not leave the book I just wanted to keep going so yeah thank you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is super cool. I hope that you get it!!! I thouroughly enjoy it ;) also get temple run- the original
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I'm Looking forward to the next . I  love the story line and the pace of the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you got ripped off by the other Minecraft games, its ok to buy this one. This is the real version. You can make worlds so you won't lose your projects, You can go mine on Survival Mode, and make amazing structures with all the blocks. I highly recommend it and it's so good, its a 10 out of 5!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never wanted this book to end. Every twist and turn truly kept me guessing. It was absolutely perfect! <3
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|It was stunning from start to finish. Seeing Frank Miller's original story come to life in such an amazing way was awe-inspiring. Peter Wellers also did an outstanding older Batman
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really loved this book. I felt like I was on an intriguingly peculiar journey the entire time. Must read!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My late neurosurgeon father had a close friend named Eben Alexander and the author is his son. This family connection brought me to the book which I approached as some light reading. But what I discovered was a very well-crafted piece of writing that conveys a message of ultimate concern.<br /><br />The author faced the challenge of the limitations of words and the bottle-neck of the English language in describing the indescribable. These limitiations were largely overcome through his story-teller's art.<br /><br />Alexander is very candid concerning his parochial scientific perspective. He admited that he dismissed spiritual evidence through his \\"simplistic scientific view of the world\\".<br /><br />Some reviewers have unfairly criticized the book as being \\"unscriptual\\" and/or New Age. I see absolutely no conflict between the Gospel of Christ and this NDE account. He is not rendering a full explanation of heaven, a soul, or the consequences of sin. Instead he is giving an account of a dedicated physician's experience with the love surrounding him in the spiritual world.<br /><br />PROOF OF HEAVEN is beautifully written and conveys a critically important message for our time.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Robin Sloan has written a very entertaining, timely and maybe timeless story. Quite entertaining. Great characters and a must read for anyone working in Silicon Valley or a bookstore. Check it out.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had rave reviews and was on the list for the most bought book via Amazon so I thought I should give it a try....<br /><br />Hopeless is a young adult book and so as a 30-something it was a step back into teenage angst for me - but an enjoyable one.<br /><br />The book is edgy and raw and Sky is a strong yet vulnerable young lady who is adopted, home schooled and sheltered from media of all kinds. She meets Hoover and her world turns upside down and she is left questioning herself, her emotions and her past and the journey they go on together is not for the faint hearted.<br /><br />It is a heady romance with a dark centre and the ride was emotional and I struggled to put the book down.<br /><br />This book does have some content that may disturb some readers; it deals with abuse and death and sexual issues that may offend. It is not overly graphic but it is worth mentioning - just in case.<br /><br />I can see why this book has been such a strong seller and I would recommend it as a quick read to a mature audience and a must have for any young adult.<br /><br />Happy reading x

B00AG6Z92C|5.0|As a music lover, it is very difficult for me to find any CD with 1, maybe 2 songs worth listening to.<br /><br />This CD has some wonderful, wonderful songs: Champagne -incredible background vocals by Bocelli himself at the end of the song-, A mano a mano, Era gia tutto previsto, Anema e Cuore. These 4 songs, all by themselves, are more than worth the price of the CD. Not by mere coincidence, these are all songs in Italian (Anema e Cuore in Napolitan), in which Bocelli seems to find -naturally- more expressiveness and soul. For all lovers of Edith Piaf, you will be touched by Bocelli and Piaf in La Vie en Rose.<br /><br />There is also some fine music here, like the Brazilian songs (especially Corcovado), very pleasant and nicely arranged by Foster, and other Italian songs, like Roma nun fa la stupida stasera.<br /><br />The weakest number is maybe the most commercial one, Quizas, Quizas, with J.Lopez.<br /><br />This is a CD with 18 songs that you will play over and over again, and you will find sheer pleasure, relaxation, and yes, also \\"passione\\". Much more than I can say of the hundreds of CDs I have listened to in the last 12 months.
0316019984|4.0|&#34;The best pop-up book in the world&#34;, according to my three-year-old son.  We gave this to him last Christmas, as he is in quite the superhero stage right now.  Also, I thought, at three-and-a-half he might be able to handle the delicate pop-ups in a more gentle fashion (so far, so good with that, though they ARE delicate!!).  THis book is ~about~ four inches thick or so, which meant that after I received it, I then had to mail it (along with some other presents) to my mom's house where we were spending Christmas, as there was no WAY this thing was going to fit in our suitcases along with all of our other stuff we needed to bring.  All in all, a great gift.  No complaints!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A great bible study application, it's the best. It's easy to maneuver and doesn't take much to see the benefits and ease of the great app.
B009329Y30|3.0|Although this isn't one of my favorite movies, it was a nice, easy, and entertaining movie to watch.  Worth a watch.
0345404475|5.0|I was skeptical from the title of the book that it might be lame, but it actually turned out to be really well written and interesting. I actually liked the book a lot better than I liked the movie (Blade Runner).
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|I liked R.E. 1, 3 & 4. I did not buy the blu-ray R.E. 5 Retribution but I rented on Amazon Prime video rentals. The movie felt to me like I was watching someone play a video game, just going around from stage to stage fighting zombies.  I do understand that's what the game is all about but, I expected the movies' plot to be of higher quality. The movie ended with the sense of other sequels to come. R.E. 1, 3 & 4 to me were more than just killing senseless zombies, the plots were much better.
B00B780TAK|5.0|Best show I have seen in a very long time! I hope to see a lot more in the future and I love that I can watch episodes on my roku before they air because I am a very impatient person :)
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|The villain is very bad, the hero is damaged, but likeable and the plots can go in just about any direction depending on the bent of the followers.<br />Recommend this to an audience that likes DEXTER or similar shows.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Still a lot to be explained, looking forward to some clarification as to why they wanted to kill mankind. I can think of lots of reasons, not sure what there's will be
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is good book for a pre-teen as well as an adult. My daughter and I are reading this book simultaneously, prior to watching the movie premier in February 2013. Lots of magic and mystery in a small town high school setting when a new girl comes to town. Nothing inappropriate - violent or bizarre or sexualized in this book. A safe read. Both my daughter and I are enjoying this book thoroughly. And there are more books to follow - as it is a series! Definitely an interesting, entertaining nightly read before going to sleep!

B000IZXR7U|5.0|Been watching this movie my whole life starting with VHS. When i put the blu ray on to show my step son it was like watching for the first time it looked so good. Highly recommended for any fan of mad max with a blu ray player.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I just happen on this book, it turned out to be a great read.  I was pleasantly suprised.  If you are looking for something different, give it a try.
B008602KQI|5.0|A well made movie which successfully follows the book.  Special effects, strong personalities which were well done, and a series of adventures leave everyone wanting more.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I appreciate that this is not a frenetic game, it requires a little thought and finesse.  The graphics are also really nice, the whole thing is a sort of calming experience.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|After searching used book stores all over for the books and short stories about Holmes, this Complete collection was a definite delight.  There are so many stories and these originals are so very good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once again I love my Fifty Shades! Once I finished the first book, I imediately continued with this one. I felt the pain and heartache both Ana and Christian feel after she leaves! I have to say I thought that they were going to spend more time apart, but only five days? Well, after reading this I can only say that I too could not be without Fifty for more than that!!!
B004LWZW9C|4.0|A movie which has a number of simultaneous stories, and includes laughter and a little romance.  Lighthearted and worth watching.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this book was amazing!! I have to admit at first, I wasn't too sure about the book. However, as soon as I began to read it I couldn't put my kindle fire down. The dynamic between Ana and Christian is great. I was really drawn to the notion whether love can conquer all and what a person is willing to give up for it was well which is well represented! I have to say I was hooked. I love my fifty shades!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The three books as a single ebook entity was exactly right for me.  I enjoy reading them together and having my Kindle to supply all the adventures of Katniss Everdeen, her friends and family.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A fitting conclusion to a story that captivated me from the beginning!!! The story of Ana and Christian is a wonderful one that takes the reader through every emotion, the good and bad! I have to say I was quite pleased with the direction their lives took after they married. Christian is quite capable of love and Ana never doubted that from the start!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Surprisingly interesting, and with quite a punch.  Katniss Everdeen is caught up in events beyond her control and draws others into her world.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I really like this album. It has some very good songs, including &#34;Locked Out of Heaven,&#34; &#34;When I Was Your Man,&#34; and &#34;Natalie.&#34;
B000JML90Y|4.0|There is so much written about this book, and so many changes to the world, that reading the original makes sense.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I bought this album mostly for &#34;Joker and the Thief,&#34; one of the greatest songs ever in my opinion, but it has some other treasures, like &#34;Apple Tree&#34; and &#34;Woman.&#34; I greatly enjoy the flute solo in one of the songs.
B000031XCR|4.0|Celine Dion has a beautiful voice which never disappoints.  This contains some of my favorite songs which made it the right choice for me.
B004XVN1T4|2.0|Not his best...too many changes in venues without connecting the characters to the base of the theme. I like this author & will read his other features
B002ZG975Q|5.0|The movie shows an overly handsome young man get a lesson from a witch; if he cannot get someone to fall in love with his ugly self in one year, then he must stay ugly forever.  Luckily, he rescues someone, they tentatively begin a friendship, and his vain personality gradually changes.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I like it a lot. its pretty fun . I just wish it was easier to get hearts and gems. yep.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Superboy has become a man, and the final season of Smallville is well done.  The adventures of Clark Kent and his many companions are excellent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app was so cool! I have Temple Run and Temple Run Brave but this was definitely the best of the trio!!!!
B003L77GGK|5.0|This series is about two brothers who travel around fighting evil.  Their allies are varied, from angels to demons, and the occasional ghost, godling, and haunted painting are the enemies.
B005FISBTO|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST SEASON EVER. CD ARRIVED BRAND NEW. NO DAMAGE TO THE PACKAGING. NO DMAGES TO THE CD'S.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Breaking Dawn is a story of two teens gradually growing and facing adult choices, decisions and consequences.  Edward and Bella wed, and the adventure ends at a point midway in the book, at the moment she wakes as a vampire.  Keep watching.  There is a little bit more to the story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first temple run had a dark and foggy look where this one is clearer and easier to see so you don't have to play in a dark area. All the changes made are great!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great price for three great movies! I like these movies they are so much fun to watch and i wil enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Good grief, I would never knowingly purchase such a book. I am embarrassed to have it on my kindle.  I never go for novels like this....big mistake on my part.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fairly easy game to pick up, everything seems to do what it's supposed to with one exception, don't use your hints you only get like 3 then you have to buy more. I would have given this game 4.4 stars but that's not an option. Over all it's a very fun, simple to learn game that will draw you in if your not careful. It's well worth the $ even if you do have to pay for helpful hints.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the whole series.  I was not disappointed with the second or subsequent books.  I wish I could find another series that captured my interest like this series has.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I love this temple run but it keeps shutting down on my Kindle and now i can never play it
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Much better than the fourth book, but still gets mired in too much detail.  I would recommend it to people who are committed to the series, but be prepared for a slog at times.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|This continues the saga of Ninefingers, who has been missing from the latest books. Life finally catches up to him and he finds that hiding is no longer possible. New characters are introduced and Abercrombie, as always, throws hardships and dilemmas for the characters, nothing is ever easy.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Was looking for something different when the local alt station played radioactive and I had to look it up. Found that I like Bleeding out and some of the others even more, great album.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book's hook - murder mystery - told from competing perspectives - is compelling.<br /><br />The plot drags a bit - but the characters are, at first  interesting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, about 60%-70% through, the personalities of the two lead characters completely change, and the plot twists and turns like a modern soap opera.<br /><br />In order to enjoy this book, you must 1) suspend all disbelief (just go with the bizarre plot lines) and 2) you have to be okay with the fact that there are no heroes in this book- its chock full of contemptable characters that are not worthy of your admiration or sympathy.
0316228532|3.0|This novel, at first appearance, resembles a Rosamunde Pilcher set piece with a village full of stereotypical Brits who speak, dress, live in vicarages and homes with names and not numbers, and work at careers that many characters in one of her books often do.  But Pagford is different, sort of like the way the apt. building in Rosemary's Baby was different from all the other ones nearby - it's a town full of dysfunctional, unhappy, guilty and mentally fragile misfits masquerading as the town's leaders.  No one seems to have avoided the negativity, except perhaps for the sexy Sikh doctor who does a lot of sardonic smiling.<br /><br />Is it a bad book?  Not at all.  But it's not great, it's too long and ultimately, too depressing.  But for those of you who like novels set in small English villages, this is one with a twist.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Didn't even know it came out but glad it did :) will definitely make the first temple run non existent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read. Fast paced and exciting. Each chapter has you on the edge wanting more. Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys books with action and excitement.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This DVD is phenomenal. It has given me a new found appreciation for nature and our earth that I did not have before. Only thing - would have love for there to be more subtitles in different languages to share with my Spanish speaking friends.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Hoping that the movie would turn around and take a good turn, I've realized that it must be one of THE worst movies I've ever wasted my time watching. Although the acting was par, the movie plot was terrible. I'd save my time and find something else if I were you!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Downloaded this free copy digitally to my tablet so that I could read along with my dauther who had to read this book for school.  Good book.
B009X01FJS|5.0|The case swivels & it meets my needs very well esp when I am lying down to read. I love it
B005K0HDGE|1.0|What do people see in his writing that I don't? Obviously I'm missing something due to his popularity. The ending, as with all his endings, was out of the context of the rest of the novel.
1451627297|3.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Sorry, Stephen King, but you've done better. The Dead Zone was masterful, and it covered some of the same ideas. However, in The Dead Zone, Johnny was much less blithe about changing history. He agonized over playing God. The point that \\"life turns on a dime\\" was made in The Dead Zone by showing rather than telling. If Jake is aware that life turns on a dime and that there is a butterfly effect, how does he dare to mess with time travel at all? It seems that Jake, who is close to my age, never saw the Back to the Future movies or read any time travel books.<br /><br />I wanted King to address, if not agree with, the conspiracy theories. He could have made Jake troubled by the points the conspiracy theorists raise at the outset of the novel. Instead, he accepts Al's made-up statistics about the probability that his beliefs are correct. As I read, there was no doubt in my mind that Jake would find that Oswald acted alone, which is one reason the middle of the book dragged. Now if Jake had watched his own conspiracy theories be debunked before his eyes, that would have been interesting. Jake puts so much effort into proving that Oswald acted alone in his attempt on General Walker. Even if he did, it proves nothing about the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />Jake did not seem like someone born in 1976. I appreciated his shock at a late 1950s bank and an early 1960s hospital room, with no computers. I wanted more details like this. As he drove that gas guzzler, did our time traveler reflect on global warming or the dangers of leaded gasoline at all?<br /><br />Things I liked--the unraveling of Jake's cover story. Sadie's reaction to the idea of a black president. Using the Jodie school board to demonstrate changing attitudes on women's issues. Sadie's role in the final chapters of the book. The details in Jake's first visit to the past.<br /><br />Things I hated: Jake's use of the phrase \\"meet cute.\\" Also the interaction with characters from IT.Both interrupted my suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Overall, I felt frustrated when I finished this book.
1451696191|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, couldn't put it down. This was a very good book. A very very good book. Yes it was.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is so much better than the first one. im almost addicted to it cuz i just downloaded it
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Really enjoyed this book! Couldn't put it down! It was an interesting historical perspective that I haven't read about before. Really gave a sense of the times.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Much better than Season Three! John Lithgow was a great addition to the cast, plays a great creepy guy! Definitely worth watching.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was not one of Nicholas Sparks' better books, you already know the outcome by the middle of the book.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Rented this for the grandson to watch. Good entertainment for a six year old! Has many of the same characters and several new ones.  My grandson loved the music.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I have not had any babies but I was totally captivated by this movie. No dialogue - just babies being babies. It's amazing to see what is intuitive and natural to a baby and how their environment affects them. Loved it!
0880793082|3.0|The price was comfortable.,  The images are clear. This is the AGMuller version, printed in Belgium, distributed by US Games.  The picture of the product advertises the deck as the one 3 magus cards. The deck I received yesterday is in the lavendar box, but does not contain all 3-images of the magus.  I'm not sure who to blame- amazon, the seller, or both.<br />This also happened to me with a deck of Lenormand Blue Owl where I ended up receiving the red owl deck instead. Again, not as advertised.<br /><br />I think Amazon needs to start finetuning how these items are grouped and presented to the buyer. I'm going to keep the deck as I needed a replacement.<br /><br />I hardly ever mention card stock quality, but I have to here: flimsy.3-stars for the vibrant images/art work alone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mindcraft its a fun game to play anywhere you are I recommend it to any kid boy or girl man or women I LOVE IT &lt;3
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as good as the other books ,like the Hunger games .Worthy of reading(Only because it completes the series) Harry Potter is a lot better!
B009K0OPQQ|2.0|the 1st season i was hooked, it was really really good, the second season, well, i just cannot take that blond woman's character, i cannot stand how she is over the top confident, true vomit material. i could not get past the 4th episode, the blond woman in the first season seemed to be more tolerable, maybe it was that i could kind of see why she had a chip on her shoulder. second season, just can't take no more
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|A fun game that fills time when you need something to fill time.  It's easy enough and the kids love it too.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|It is absolutely adorable. Great addition to the Ice Age Family of movies.  Exactly what you would want it to be.
B008476HBM|5.0|Unfortunately watched the movie first but the book by no means disappointed. My newest favorite. I fell in love with Mr. Darcy all over again.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|worked great...did expect some info materials in the case..wasn't any . previous cd cases  had background info pamphlets and such
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Great drama, fantastic story... only hangup is the believability of Liam N's performance in some of the physical aspects.  Still a movie i'll be watching again.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|del in good condition...woeks fine...did expect more info pamphlets with it...but would recommend to others...we have the whole series now...thanks for having available
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Interesting on how a non first-of-the-class bacame so effective. Would recommend to know the story of how somebody succeed in such a stressing field as a SEAL Sniper is.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|you dont have to be a gamer to appreciate this game.  it was so.much fun from the first turn, i was hooked!  Feels like a real chase so much my heart races!  You need this game!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book is well written to lead you through the story without giving away the who done it too soon.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This  book kept me  up til 3:30 in the morning because I couldn't get enough of it! I felt like  I was watching a crazy suspense movie.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The subject of the book is depressing yet inspirational at the same time.  I thought the insight into teenage thinking coupled with the painful situation of terminal illness was well presented.  I highly recommend this book.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|I like the book because if you don't no the meanings you can look the word and find out the meanings of the words
B009VB97EY|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this movie. I really felt like I was watching one of Channing Tatum's dancing flicks. The acting wasn't that great, but it had its high points. The best part was the club scenes (so the ladies will like that).
B0056CUZRA|3.0|I enjoyed the story line of this book. Was well done i became engrossed with it.  I .would reccomend to my friends
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love all of Michael Connelly's books and this is not an exception.  Even though the twists and turns in this novel are not as intricate as some of Connelly's, it was a great read on a number of levels.  Seeing Harry with his daughter, Maddie, is terrific fun and The Black Box offers a view into Harry's perspective on relationships that I've not seen before.  Totally recommend!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|There are probably not great enough words to encourage others to share this great homage to Victor Hugo' timeless novel.  Well Done!
0525423281|4.0|My Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Overview of the Novel: Lola might be eccentric but she has a great boyfriend. He's older, more mature, and definitely what she needs. But then Calliope and Cricket Bell move back into the house next door and her world is turned upside down. Lola used to be friends with Calliope and then Calliope burnt her. She was friends with Cricket and maybe even more and then he completely crushed her. She doesn't want to have to deal with him and besides she has an awesome boyfriend.<br /><br />My Overall Thoughts/Impressions: I had heard such fantastic things about Anna and the French Kiss and Lola and the Boy Next Door that I was really excited to read them. I was slightly disappointed with Anna, but I still really liked it. So I went into Lola with mixed feelings. I was surprised by how much I ended up loving it.<br /><br />Lola was eccentric and yet I found myself connecting with her character and desperately wanting to learn more about her. I think many of us can relate to liking our best friend, the one guy we think we can never have, or at least think we can't.<br /><br />It's a plot that's cliched. Girl loves boy next door. Boy next door doesn't love her back....and so on. But Stephanie Perkins did a great job of breathing new life into this cliched plot. I was never bored.<br /><br />I also loved how Stephanie tied this novel into her last one. I loved learning more about Anna and Etienne. I love when authors weave in old characters without overpowering the new characters' stories. Perkins did that masterfully.<br /><br />And although, I knew what would happen in the end I thoroughly enjoyed getting there. This book was an exciting one to read and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />So why 4 stars? Although I loved it, it just wasn't quite 5 star material. I liked the novel--the writing was masterful, the plot was expertly crafted, and the characters were intriguing. But it lacked that extra kick to make this novel especially memorable. It's still one of my favorites I've read this year, however.<br /><br />In Summary: Stephanie Perkins has created a realistic contemporary young adult series that readers will adore. She writes quirky, realistic characters that readers will fall in love with and does so with a depth that is unusual to the genre. Definitely recommended.<br /><br />Warnings/Side-notes: Lola's parents are gay. If that bothers you, then this is probably not the book for you. However, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this novel.<br /><br />The Wrap-up: I can't wait to see what Perkins does in her next novel. This one was beautifully written and thoroughly enjoyable. I flew through this one and can't wait to read the third one.<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Danica Pagely memorable.

B005H29GSI|3.0|My 12-year-old and I attempted to play this game last night.  Most of the time was spent assembling the castles on which the pigs would sit than it was on actual shooting.  We could get the small, yellow bird to fly 12 inches, but big red would mostly roll.  Of the castles we did build, we NEVER got all the pigs knocked down, nor do the helmets fit such that they will fall off the pig ears once they are on.  I cannot recommend this as a game, but I can see how both of my girls will have fun playing with the pieces and the birds and the pigs as a TOY.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game it is really fun<br /><br />I love how it explains the rules in the beginning of the game
B0071BGOJC|5.0|A fantastic story that has been well researched. The story is gripping and characters are plausible without seeming too contrived
B00943SQCI|5.0|All wonderful characters, Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, A perfect Time Burton movie. This is my all time favorite movie. I have watched it more tiimes then I can count.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Well constructed story that was well written and kept my attention. A light read that was well suited to holiday entertainment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game<br />You should get it . If you like temple run you sol will not be disappointed by this game
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A great game to pass the time with. My kids enjoy it and even my 3 year old grandson likes to play it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I read The hunger games and it kept entertained, Catching fire was better than the first. Seeing as how the first was good enough to keep me in it, I would say the second is worth your time.
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazon is great.<br />This is a movie that I will watch over and over again.  I would highly recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Very slow start to the book.  Too much repetition of same information.  I almost stopped reading it.  The last 25 percent of the book made it worth hanging in there.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the best I love how it has speical feature s its so amizin hatred gonna hat this game but lover's gonna love get it its free and every thing my one concern is some kits might by diamonds with real money but other than that wonderful app
140123769X|5.0|Although small in scope I found this arc to be the most heartbreaking and thoughtful in what is easily one of the top three comics being published today. I would disagree with the other reviewer and say that at 6 issues it is the perfect length: not drawn out at all. Yes, you could describe the events that transpire this volume's primary arc with just a few words but it's the details that make this moving. The two parallel journeys the two White-Wolf children make that lead them to their respective decisions is what makes Bill Willingham such a fantastic writer.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|If you are an avid reader, this is a must have.  The details of writing paint such splendid pictures of the times.  You will not have to wonder what Paris was like because Victor goes into great detail.  If you are a leisurely reader, this book will be a good read.  If you are a non reader, this book will drive you crazy.  I enjoyed it more after I saw the movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I am so happy that this experience came from a neurosurgeon, as many in the medical and scientific field have lost their sense of just how special and loved we are as humans.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very challenging game. We love playing. Much more entertaining then the first game. If you liked the first you will love this one too
1451627297|4.0|Usually, I find King's books overly wordy and the protagonists helpless victims, but this book rocked.  I could almost smell the industrial pollution, cigarette smoke and Avon perfume.  I could see kids jumping rope and riding bikes together. And I remembered the terrible pain of JFK's assassination all over again. And, who knew Mr. King was such a romantic? The pages flew. Absolutely delightful read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great mindless fun.  If you liked it at the fair,  you'll love it here.  Waiting at the doctor's office,  waiting for your spouse to return to the car,  pretty much anywhere.  Enjoy.
B0000CAQ26|3.0|Not what I expected. I love her work, but can't bring myself to recommend this C.D. Try \\"I'm not Dead\\" or \\"The Truth about Love\\" before you \\"Try This\\"
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I have always loved the Mario games, so finding this little gem made me very happy. The game is fun for all ages and its free!  Works great on my kindle fire hd 7 inch.
B000EGCITG|5.0|If you love &#34;The Truth about Love&#34; you'll adore this. Once again she has drawn on her life experiences to accomplish amazing musical and lyrical songs that will have you laughing one minute, crying the next but always being able to associate with the songs. It will get you moving and you will be moved as well. Definately worth purchasing.
B000000OE7|5.0|I waited a long time to purchase this CD, thinking it might not be &#34;good&#34; Queen music. I was wrong. The music is superb. But the entire CD has a very unique feel and sound to it. Heavy, serious on most of the songs. And given the circumstances under which most of the lyrics were written and Freddie's vocals were recorded, it's quite sad. Bottom line: this is an absolute must-have if you are a Queen and/or Freddie fan. You won't put it on and rock-out; you'll put it on and listen.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Lot's of fun! (Suggestion:  After the Genie solves, show how many questions it took.) Good game to play in a group.
B002M9WW30|5.0|A must have for all Rocky fans and I was also happy to see the extra features in the bonus dvds
B003ODHOA4|1.0|The Kindle edition has bitmaps for the romanization (pinyin) and Chinese characters. They are microscopic on my device, and don't resize with the font size. The bitmaps have white backgrounds with black characters, so if you configure your Kindle to use a black background, you get white boxes around the tiny, illegible Chinese characters. The bitmaps also prevent searching from working properly and are completely missing when this eBook is viewed in the Cloud Reader.<br /><br />Otherwise, this looks like a useful book. As others have noted, it is quite explicit.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Just received my BK2 a few days ago, and I am thoroughly impressed. This is an awesome knife! Feels great and extremely solid in the hand, and carries quite a bit of heft. Got it for camping/bug out bag and I think it will be perfect. Thick blade and full tang. Sheath is high quality. All for (what I feel) is a steal compared to other 'high end' knives.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Suspense.  Horror.  Kevin Bacon.  It's like &#34;The River&#34; on steroids, but this time Kevin is the good guy.  'Nuf said.
0765325950|5.0|Some may complain that too many plot lines were not fully devoped in the last books written by Brandon Sanderson and others complain that Robert Jordan spent too much time describing rotting food and Aes Sedai dresses.  All I can feel is absolute gratitude for both of these men.  Robert Jordan began us all on a wonderful journey.  I was very fortunate to jump along for the ride back in the early 90's.  But, Brandon, you found our ticket home.  Thank you so much.  I hope all the great reviews for the Memory of Light make the 1 star reviews for the e-book drama a non-issue. And yes, I am writing this in the middle of the night after having read the final chapter of the final book. Best wishes Wheel of Time family!  What a wonderful journey it has been!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book. Author had a great imagination, very detailed. Lined it much better than the movie. An easy read series
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Some action. Some touching of the heart. Some interesting futuristic scenarios. A whole lot of suspension of disbelief. Not bad.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me up until 2:30 a.m.  I could not put it down.  It was real and the characters were relatable.  Well written.  I highly recommend this but make sure you don't have anything else to do - you won't want to take a \\"chapter break\\".
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was one of those books where you can't wait for the next page, but sometimes it's so gut wrenching that you have to put it down for a bit.  Landay keeps one guessing right up until the end and even then you're not sure about the guilt or innocence of Jacob.<br /><br />I thought the characters were developed just enough so that I wasn't totally sure that I &#34;knew&#34; who they were.  The only real drawback was that I found some unanswered questions about the situation surrounding the murder.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So very addictive I can't stop playing... I'm too impatient though. I wish I could have a never ending supply of coins!
B00451VH84|5.0|This DVD was just what I'd hoped it would be! Even though it was from the &#34;used&#34; catagory, it was in mint condition! My grandson's were mesmerized,just as  the 2 generations before them have been. This vendor is wonderful, and will be a trusted place to come to for future purchases.
0920668372|1.0|My 19 month old daughter was given this book and I'm at a loss as to how this book even got published.  It seems people either love it or hate it.  Once I got to the part where the mother was stalking her grown son and cuddling with him like he was a baby, I removed it from my child's room.  I find this book disturbing and an example of a competely inappropriate relationship between a parent and child.  It acrually grosses me out.  If you want to raise a Norman Bates, then this will give you some ideas on what to do to your kid.  Otherwise, make sure that this book isn't in your kid's room!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Yes, I love the romance. Like everyone else, lurve Etienne. But even more than that I love the voice of this novel. It is so wonderfully funny and entertaining and I can read each sentence again and again and again. And probably will.
0061353248|3.0|---but I found it to be a little redundant. I have many similar publications that have stated the same things. Still---worth the investment.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I've read a lot of books about NDE experiences and enjoyed this one because of the medical terminology incorporated since the author is a neurosurgeon.  I would have given it 5 stars had there been more detailed descriptions of his experience, although I realize he was probably providing as much as he could remember.  It was interesting to me how much different his NDE was compared to many others and I really liked that he wrote his own recall down BEFORE reading of any others.  That gave more authenticity to his own.
B001615LO2|4.0|This little chewie is really cute and has his own tiny bandolier. The only problem is that he is a little small for the price.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game since it doesn't require Internet its fun and the horses are so realistic.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves animals.
B00ARN0WBW|3.0|It looks to me like a home made movie. There were some parts where nothing was on. Also some scenes were not easy to see. The story was scary enough!
B009AMALLM|5.0|Katie is back and this time she is not alone. Hunter is a very creepy child. The new teenage girl was a good actress. Everybody was believable. Oren Peli is a genius. He keeps prducing these excellent movies. Don't want to totally give away the ending because it is mind-blowing and a really great payoff. Bring Katie back every time! Can't wait for the 5th one. Cheers!
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|She bring to life the greatest songs ever produced I would recomend this album for anyone who love pure music.
1451620829|5.0|I purchased this online for my cousin as a favor, so she could give it to her son for Christmas.  Service was excellent, and she was pleased.  Her son was impressed.
0765356147|1.0|I loved the first two books and would give them both 4 stars each.  However, this 3rd book of the series deserves one star, and I was extremely disappointed in who turned out be the Hero of Ages.  I was also disappointed in the killing of the two main characters in the series.
B0025KW29U|5.0|This is already an excellent creation (thank you Joss!) and this blu ray has the high quality you'd expect with heaps of extras (commentary: the musical, anyone?). Highly recommended for anyone who likes Joss, Buffy-esque craziness, great comedy, quick/witty dialogue and highly original concepts.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book was a very quick read and it was interesting to hear about what these very elite individuals go through. You should definitely read it if you want to know about the training and get a bit of a clearer picture of the Bin Laden raid. With that being said, don't expect a whole lot of insight into his life. He mentions the emotional toll on family, on friends, and on himself, but only briefly. He comes off more as a man with little insight, which you probably have to have to do a job like that. He shares his political views from time to time, which lack even more insight. Some of what he says is true, but definitely don't read it if you're looking for the views of a Navy Seal on the politics of Afghanistan, they are lacking. Once again, you probably have to see the world in black and white if you are going to have that type of job. Some of what he says could be so easily argued against though, it's crazy.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Webcam software has all the functionality including sound to provide easy viewing and camera selection and access. Would recommend to a friend
B00APUYN0I|3.0|My teenage daughters wanted to watch this so my wife and I watched it with them.<br /><br />On the Plus side<br />Cool Covers and mixes of some great music.  We will be buying the soundtrack.<br />Some great one liners.  We are all dropping quotes from the movie.<br />Some of the characters are a little bit believable.<br /><br />On the Minus side<br />There's risque and then there's low.  Maybe I'm too conservative but it seemed that rather than funny the writers were often reaching for pure shock value with very little redeeming quality in their content.<br />Many of the characters were so distorted that they didn't add much to the storyline.<br />Maybe I'd be a touch more positive with a tougher rating from MPAA.  For my seventeen year old np but I definitely was glad to be in the room with my 14 year old while watching this film to discuss some aspects of decision making surrounding campus life.
B0071BY1CO|4.0|The 3D is some of the best I've seen in a while. A very nice mix of pop-out and depth, the 3D disc is spectacular. I found extremely mild ghosting on background objects when viewed on my active 3D set. It's not distracting in the least. The 3D darkens the image in some night scenes, but not nearly as bad as other 3D I've seen.<br /><br />The 2D is crisp and clear, with great color and detail. Sound is great, this disc (like the 3D) makes very good use of surround sound.<br /><br />The movie itself is unexpectedly charming, and more mature than I expected. Not mature in a way inappropriate for kids, just more sophisticated in humor, action, and character development.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend it highly, but don't feel comfortable giving it 5 stars with the minor issues on the 3D disc.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy.  It has just the right amount of satire and suspense.  I am only sad that they have not brought out the miniseries on DVD.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Very good movie.  Watched over the holidays with my family.  Lesson to be learned is to never give up on family---they are the most precious and needed people in your life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great graphics- love the new scenes. Especially like cart surfing! Must say, only downside is there is limited cart surfing. Did anyone ever reach the end?
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I may be one of the few women who disliked the trilogy immensely.  One of my worst purchases. Really hated it
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|By far one of the best albums of its era and beyond. Brilliant writing and performances. A must have for every music collection.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This was not the best book I've ever read, but it's top five on my list of intensely emotional books.  There were a couple of things that seemed unreal, even for fiction...and one or two editing errors.  I thought the characters' relationship was so very over the top,  yet that was also the very thing I loved about it.  Not all of us fall in love in such a roller coaster kind of way, and it was nice to feel that emotion, even if only for  a few hours.  The subject matter and the violence took me out of my comfort zone every now and then, but that's what a good book should do...it gets awfully boring reading about characters who react to events in the same way I would.  All in all, I really liked the story..
B0081BU42O|3.0|I think the worst of the culture novels.  It seems hastly written and poorly edited.  It alternates between boring passeges of long words seeming used to make the book more pretentious, and simple passages written at almost grade school level.  The characters are generaly shallow and hard to feel any empathy for.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I have enjoyed plenty of the books of Ken Follet, most of all &#34;The pillars of the earth&#34; however I found that this particular book lacks it's characteristic narrative and most of all I find it unnecesarilly  ideologically charged. I hope the second book of the trilogy to be much better to compensate for the dissapointment in this one.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|If I could give a 4.5 rating I would.  Grabs u and all too soon it's done.<br />Thanks for the ride.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Ordered this cd for my wife after we saw the &#34;jersey boys&#34;.  She has probably worn it out by now but the music I have listened to was clear and had a good solid sound.  I would recommend this to a friend
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy read & a great sweep you off your feet LOVE story!!  Fairy tale & worth the read and hard to put down once you pick it up
B001POX73C|5.0|Light hearted regency romp from the inventor of the genre, with a little twist. Appealing characters in tangled situations with well written dialogue and lots of period detail.
B005OP7162|5.0|Warning -- Do not watch unless you have long segments of time to devote to this.  Highly addictive!  The actress (Emily Van Camp) is perfect as Amanda Clark.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|It was just to slow. I thought it was boring and I was just could bring myself to follow it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|If you loved Season 1, and are willing to suspend disbelief just a little longer then Revenge Season 2 is for you!  Some of the plot lines are a little too far fetched but this series continues to be a fun ride.
1616550414|5.0|After many years of Amazon purchases, I have never written a review before. This book is absolutely amazing. The level of detail, artwork, creation, and care put into this book has left me in awe. I have been a fan of Zelda ever since Link to the Past, and this book...is perfection. The descriptions of locations, events, characters, everything you could possibly need is in here. I have only been through a couple pages and it took me 30 minutes to go over just those few pages. The detail is superb. Included in the back is also a manga, which is in half color too. I can't say much more, you must buy it for yourself and experience the beauty of all things Zelda. This book is so amazing that it finally pushed me to write a product review. 5 stars throughout history and many more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Having lived through that time in history and heard and read the different theories over the years , this book made me think of it in a new and different way
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I am so in love with this show. It packs the right amount of mystery, drama, humor and suspense Can't wait for Season 3 to come out!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It was cute and ok for my pre-teen granddaughter who is into acting and theatre.  We spent a snowy Sunday afternoon together watching the movie and baking cookies.  The acting was less than high quality and the girl's group was a little unrealistic or simplistic in their choices.  Overall, happpy we saw the movie.  There is so much violence on the current market that we were happy to have had this choice.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just started playing and love the graphics. I have had to restart the game due to trouble loading competitions or randomly stop working hence the loss of one star.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Chose the movie as it was going to be viewed by multi-generauions on a weekend afternoon,  We all enjoyed the action and the story
B007J4T2G8|5.0|With all of the \\"mommy porn\\" hype I had heard about this book, I was skeptical when I received it as a gift from a friend. After reading it, I was hooked...not because of all of the sex, but because the two characters were so willing to be vulnerable for the other. Amazing story!
B005CRQ3NY|1.0|This book  is a  great great great book .<br />Dog Days is required now.<br />I LOVE THIS GREAT  BOOK.<br />This is a must read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this games fun even if your older generation. I love it easy to play an understand just follow instrushion<br /><br />'
B008XG1X18|4.0|I would have given 5 stars, but the app occasionally freezes on my Kindle Fire. It is very easy to scroll thru the many options, such as categories, my home page, and my personal page. User friendly!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Jake Epping is a present-day schoolteacher who travels back in time to 1958 through a rabbit-hole in his friend's restaurant pantry. He sets out to stop the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 and finds himself in love with the school librarian, Sadie. Throughout some time he attempts to right a few wrongs by altering other parts of the past.<br /><br />This is not a horror story by any means but it is full of twists and turns. I genuinely liked Jake and wished the best for him. This is such a good book. I never read books twice but this is one I will definitely pick up again.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Easy reading..enjoyed the humor makes u think back to your own high school experience I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has ever felt like it was hard fitting in in high school or life in general..
B001ANSS5K|3.0|I love John Green's books and I started out loving this book too. Quentin is funny and in love with the girl next door who never really paid him any attention... until one wild night she involves him in her crazy antics. She runs away shortly after and leaves him clues on how to find her. He obsesses over her and gets his friends involved in finding her too. They go on a road trip and that is where I stopped caring. Parts of this book are hilarious; parts are predictable. All the characters are lovable with one exception... By the end I truly did not care about Margo, her annoying name, or attention seeking antics. The ending left me at &#34;meh&#34;. I just didn't care anymore.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I wish that all app's were so well designed.  The app is functionally beautiful, the design is functional first and foremost but also pleasant to the eye in a subtle way.  I get the informmation that I need in a glance without a lot of the visual clutter that plagues most other apps.  The app opens to the basic status of your battery with an easy to read graphic that gives percentage of battery life remaining, and charge status ( Bat / AC / USB ).  From the main tap &quot;Advanced&quot; for more detailed information and the &quot;Usage&quot; button.  This is perhaps the only app that I've found to be worth more than I gave for it.
B006MOW98E|4.0|Very cute holiday book of three short stories written by three authors. I read this book because one of the stories was written by one of my favorite authors, John Green. His characters are always so funny and parts of this book had me laughing out loud. This book doesn't disappoint. Who doesn't love a good Christmas love story?
0375758992|5.0|Gift for my sister, so I did not read it.  My sister loved it so it must have been good.
B000I3PA8Q|3.0|There's really no good reason why someone should go backwards in time to retrieve humpback whales, but that doesn't stop this movie from trying. And that's really my only complaint. The premise is really pretty silly, but this is still one of the most light-hearted and enjoyable Star Trek movies in the series. If you are looking for a lot of space adventure, it doesn't deliver like some others, but there are a lot of laughs. It also completes the story arc that begins in &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34;, and I think brings that whole saga to a nice conclusion.
0062127241|5.0|Arrived on time, have not read it yet, have several books received for Christmas. Looking forward to reading it soon.
B00870ZH3U|5.0|I cannot wait till this comes to the US and see it on stage.  The music and the characters had me spellbound.  Andrew Lloyd Webber is a true master storyteller.
B007THA4FI|4.0|When I started reading it, I thought there were too many characters. Towards the end I could see how these characters play fairly significant roles in the whole plot. Quite enjoyed the read but I think the names are rather Harry Potter-ish.
B0063IH60K|1.0|...tap play. otherwise this has just taken a nosedive into unbearable. get up to four games in a row with similar deals (all same color  or all face cards etc) takes all the fun out of playing
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Great price and shipping. My kids love angry birds. Because of all the seasonal games, I gave each of my kids a angry birds board game.
B00AHSGNJM|1.0|This review is more about Amazon than the movie, which is fantastic. 4 Stars! Well, I guess I should have researched this before buying, but then again why should I when there is an option to \\"buy\\" this item, which is what I chose. After my purchase, I found myself looking for the \\"Download\\" button so I can view this movie I now \\"own\\" on the device of my choice. To my dismay, there is no way to download movies from Amazon. I just assumed this would be possible, since I can do so with music I buy on Amazon. I don't get it. It says I own this movie, but I just have access to watch it. BullS***.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great no trouble like netflix. So when you up date this app dont screw it up like you did netflix
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Really enjoyed this account of a Near Death Experience, particularly as it was being described by a neurosurgeon who had a scientific understanding of what happens to the brain at the time of death yet now had to reconsider what he thought he knew given his own personal encounter with death.  Everything he thought he knew and understood was now in question, and he felt compelled to share what he had discovered while in a coma and with a neocortex no longer functioning.  A great read, and the authors background brings another level of credibility for those in doubt about an afterlife.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|fun app. love the graphics and the mystery of the story. g5 is a favorite for game apps. have a few and enjoy them all.
B0053O89WY|5.0|It worked great couldn't be happier with the quality of the disc and it's so much cheaper here than in the store
B002PEP4SC|4.0|A good read. I certainly didn't guess \\"who done it\\" until almost the end. Like most mystery novelists, Castle is not the best love scene writer. Those were a small part of the novel, so that's a forgivable offense. I do plan to read more by this author.
B003L77G6A|5.0|It worked great couldn't be happier with the quality of the disc and it's so much cheaper here than in the store
B009O07NDY|4.0|Im enjoying all the songs, but I think it should have more, you know more power and more increchentos, the main song its strong but no so strong I would like to, its a Dark longliness album
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so cool because u can train your own horse, and the horse can play in world cops and stuff.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was a amazing book and I want to read it again<br />And again that is how good it is
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book I would recommend it to all those greek myth lovers out there and anyone who wants to have a laugh
B006YTTVHO|2.0|It was an ok book I was hopping it would be a what to say if someone says something mean
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun its a great way to pass time great for kids also. And there is always something to do u will never want to get off!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely love this story. Couldn't put the book down and now that I'm finished I wish the story wasn't over.
B008745B32|3.0|This was among the so proclaimed 'classics' that in my reading life I had never gotten to.  Not sure why.  So I finally got it and decided to rectify this missing piece of my literary education so to speak.  hmm  To me this is a book best read in one's youth for as a 60+ someone I found it nearly silly.  Such wordy, lengthening dribble more or less. On and on and on it goes in youthful excess of words, endless 'feelings' and 4 pages of descriptive meanderings to describe a cup.  Well, not quite that I'll acknowledge but for heavens sake.  Let's just leave it at I was less than impressed and don't feel I'd have missed much had I left this one unread altogether.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy being able to pull this up and use it for just a few minutes or longer if I want.  I  like looking at my stats and some of the things you can do (changes you can make after the fact & Helpful hints you can access).  It's fun!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I have read the 4 currently release Cousins' War novels and they are all fantastic, I can see why Star is creating a mini-series from them. I look forward to the 2 remaining books.
B0063IH60K|1.0|too many pop=up not user friendly.  not everyone like/wants face book can not enjoy a game that is interuped all the time with pop up adds and request to join face book very poor marketing
B00APUYN0I|4.0|The perfect movie for a rainy day. It is full of light-hearted comedy and shows a positive side to college life.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love mlp its fun playing the game! I hope they continue to update it so we all can enjoy it
B002APU580|5.0|Jane Austin has long been an author beloved for the romance of her novels.  This movie certainly does the novel justice portraying sweeping landscapes and grandeur among the every day lives in the English countryside.  Knightley's portrayal of the well read thoughtful Elizabeth gives the role the true passion and charm it deserves.
B0000025H6|5.0|Wouldn't be without this cd in my collection.  This is the 3rd copy of this that I've bought over the years.
B0015DROBO|5.0|A page turner of the first order. My friend told me to read this book and that I would not be disappointed and boy was he right.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I don't remember seeing a movie with this twist of a theme.  Enjoyable.  But there are violent parts, so be aware.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Usually books with more than 400 pages are a bit off putting but in this instance I was disappointed that it ended. It and the first book are a great read.
0439813786|3.0|Three stars really didn't seem good but the best I could say about this book was that I liked it, not really liked, which would have garnered four stars. I guess I thought is was a little overrated. I did like the combination of words and pictures and how the author/illustrated used that combination to tell the story. I just thought the story was alright. It was an easy read, which took less than a day, but it just didn't blow me away.<br /><br />I had the same feeling when I saw the movie...that it was just okay, nothing I would watch twice or suggest to someone else to watch. I guess when I watch a movie and especially read a book, I expect to be thrilled as I've given up a good portion of my day.<br /><br />John Darryl Winston.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My wife and I are both wheat and grain free after reading this book. It will change your life and your diet. Wheat/grains, not fat and cholesterol are what is wrong with American diets.
B003QSLDTA|5.0|This is entertaining movie. We watched it with whole family. If you want to laugh, this movie is the one to watch.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|There are so many great eBooks for Kindle, but until I found this app, I could not take advantage of them.  I do not own a Kindle but am now able to read Kindle books on my phone and PC.  It is easy to make purchases and read.  I love it.  I am so glad that Amazon made this app available.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|For those unfamiliar with Greek mythology, this latest version may be entertaining, especially to young kids, but the story line is far removed from the real story of Perseus. I would rather watch the old version (1981) even with less animation and less gruesome fights to this; at least, the old version is more educational and a bit more faithful to the mythology.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love horses so this one was a no brainer .. loving it so far.. need friends! Add me.. MarcyC
0937381888|5.0|This book was a Christmas gift for our son, so we don't know first hand how it is, but he was very pleased to receive it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very interesting keeps you wanting to read more.  Have always enjoyed John Grisham  novels.  This one is one I would recommend to most everyone.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This has been the best note taker, keeper, organizer I've used yet. I tend to be very organized and this helped a lot. It is simple to use, and list out what you've added.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is the ideal game for a spare 5 minutes. Great graphics and smooth game play. Hard to believe that it's free!
B0094LYBT2|5.0|We need more family movies like this that have strong moral and ethical positions, if we ever want our country and our families to survive the current decline of both.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|leps world was okay and the graphics were good but this one has WAY better graphics and more options if you liked the first one you'll like this one!!! :D :D
B00280LYIC|4.0|I absolutely love this book and all the rest of them by rick riordan. Its a must have for all readers of all ages.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|This app is great on my android phone. On the kindle fire it crashes in about 30 seconds.  It's been that way for a couple of weeks at least. Does anyone care?
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is hilarious!! It was fun for the whole family. Great family movie night choice! Will probably buy this one.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|It was a very good show and just not long enough.  I enjoy all episodes of this series. Keep up the good work.
1840220554|3.0|Good product. Speedy delivery
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Works great. Color good. Wish I got one with a place to put the stylus. I wonder how long the elastic band will last.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Good product. Speedy delivery
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green does a very good job writing from a teenage girl's point of view. I thought the portrayal of cancer treatment was also very accurate. The dialog and thoughts are very blunt and realistic. I loved the humor and Hazel is a wonderful and inspiring character. I'm only half-way through the book and am having a hard time putting it down!
1616550414|5.0|i recieved my copy this morning and when i opened it the book was in perfect condition. this is one of the best art/background books you can purchase. the cover is just as nice as i thought it would be. the content inside is even better,worth the price no matter what.
1594487154|5.0|For me a book is valuable if I have sentences throughout that are both highlighted and underlined as well as notes scribbled inside the front cover.  To Sell is Human is, therefore, valuable.  Mr. Pink has a unique ability to blend research, stories and humor.  Most non-fiction books are easy to set aside, but not To Sell is Human.  Mr. Pink convincingly makes his case that we all move people (or attempt to) daily; so we should develop our skill at doing so.  One of his researched stories is about the positive impact that adding pictures to CT Scans makes.  The process then becomes more personal efficacious for more intense focus and better healthcare.  So I've begun putting pictures of my clients in my office to remind me that they're not sterile accounts but friends.  Another application from reading the book is that unless people see an aged picture of themselves, planning for retirement doesn't register well because it's as if people are planning for a stranger.  So, as a financial planner, I intend to use an app that ages people to show to my clients when discussing retirement and end-of-life issues.  I've implemented other ideas from the book, but I'm tired of typing.  Just buy it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|the movie is not as good as the second but still a great film, worth picking up since it still offers a great atmosphere for a dark knight film.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so wonderful. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love. I have goosebumps just moments after reading it. And I almost can't wait to read it again even though it is one of the single most emotionally trying books I have ever read. It is such a beautiful work of art. I can't recommend this book to other readers enough. What can I say? It made me feel beautiful and sad. It made me feel infinite.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I work night-shift, so I sleep during the day. I also have 3 small boys who fight, scream, run around, etc. I tried sleeping with earplugs, and they were too uncomfortable to sleep with, so I looked into using a white noise app.<br /><br />Originally I used a free program called \\"Rain Sounds\\". It only had five or six sounds (all rain), and they were pretty quiet. I had to buy a set of external speakers in order to make the sounds loud enough for me to drown out the noises my kids were making. Things were okay, but then White Noise was Amazon's free app of the day, and I downloaded it, and it's changed my life.<br /><br />There are a ton of sounds. Lots of rain sounds, but pretty much anything and everything you can think of as a relaxing noise, and you can download more for free from within the app itself.<br /><br />The sounds are much louder than the app I used to use. I still use the external speakers, but I have to turn the volume down because if I don't it's too loud. The speakers give it more of a surround-sound depth, which is why I still use them, but it's no longer an issue about the volume anymore.<br /><br />There are also a lot of small touches that I wasn't expecting. There's a digital clock display feature, snooze settings, volume balance controls, etc. This app goes far beyond the free apps I've used in the past. I'm very thankful that I got this app for free, but I would recommend this app to anyone looking to get a good sleep in a loud environment.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a good story I could not put it down!I read this in one day and I must say it was very entertaining. I'm a guru for love stories!
B007OLYQ4E|3.0|First, the short stories.  House of Flowers and A Diamond Guitar are both so forgettable that I can't recall a thing about them, or want to.  A Christmas Memory, however, is lovely.  It's a recollection of a time when a little boy and his old female cousin were constant companions.  The woman is never referred to by name; instead the narrator tenderly calls her \\"my friend.\\"  One is too young, and the other too simple-minded to be of significance to the more powerful members of the family.  Left to their own devices, they engage in small adventures in their small world.  But there is nothing small about the genuine joy and love they experience in each other's company.  The march of time brings about a heartbreakingly poignant ending that will bring tears to your eyes.  Now for Breakfast at Tiffany's.  I can't tell you how many times I read and re-read this novella trying to figure Holly Golightly out.  Actually, it's less a story than an in-depth character sketch.  Or, to be more precise, character sketches, for Holly contains multitudes.  She's a composite portrait of the gold-diggers Capote has known and been fascinated by (including his own mother).  The problem is that he throws both successful and unsuccessful ones in the mix.  The two sides of that particular coin contradict one another, and Capote seems unwilling to give up any of those personality and character traits.  He tries to have it both ways with Holly and ends up with a mishmash character without believable motives.  She comes across as an almost mythological fantasy figure.  Capote's Holly gets credit for being a romantic, idealistic lost soul concerned with hanging onto her authenticity.  She has such a rarified, peculiar sense of honor that she paints herself into a corner and seems certain to meet a tragic end.  At the same time she's a born survivor: a hard-boiled, street-smart con artist who's cagey enough to shake down men for a living, edgy enough to mix nonchalantly with Mafia types, and nervy enough to jump bail and flee the country.  One minute she's a whore with a heart of gold, and the next she's a nice girl with a heart of brass.  Which one is it?  WHO IS SHE?  Interestingly, Capote takes off his rose-colored glasses to give us the unvarnished truth about who Holly is in the character of Mag Wildwood.  Like Holly, Mag is a hillbilly who reinvents herself in the big city.  Like Holly, Mag is a chic cafe society girl looking to bag a rich husband.  And, like Holly, Mag has a vocal tic that adds to her charm.  Mag s-s-stutters, making the most ordinary th-th-things sound c-c-cute. Holly sprinkles her conversation with Miss Piggy French (\\"QUEL rat\\"), and rich-bit** word emphasis (\\"Oh DARLING, I AM so sorry\\").  Even though they're two of a kind, the difference is that, in their calling, Mag is a success and Holly a failure.  Capote is insistent, however, that Mag is a true whore, while Holly is a romantic.  Going by her actions, I fail to see the difference.  I can't picture Holly bagging a rich husband and living in luxury, or settling down in the suburbs, or going crazy, or committing suicide.  I don't think Capote could, either.  All those different women Holly represents came to different, contradictory ends.  To choose just one of those fates would make Holly seem either banal or tragic.  He has nowhere to go, so he basically throws up his hands suggests a vague, wistful, ride into the sunset.  There is no end for Holly because she was just meant to be Capote's attempt to preserve in amber all of those women he knew-captured forever at the height of their allure and power.  Holly's sole function is to be an object of beauty, like the African woodcarver's sculpture.  She's a myth.  Holly's former agent, O.J. Berman, uses a succint phrase to describe her crazy ideas.  I think it also applies to the entire Holly Golightly character Capote serves up:  \\"Horses*** on a platter.\\"
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Slow moving plot with repetitive violence (yes, we GET it!)  Dark, depressing...not entertaining!<br />Do NOT waste your time on this movie!  Would not even give it 1 star if possible.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book because of some of the negative reviews but I'm glad I didn't listen. Yes, this is another story of spousal abuse, but I didn't find it to be depressing or too graphically violent. It has a Nicholas Sparks take on it that leaves you feeling hopeful and to me that made it different from other tales of abuse. I love what he did with the character of Jo and how you could see Katie's character grew stronger through the book, and the last chapter made me want to go back and re-read certain parts of the story. It's longer than a short story but short enough to finish on a rainy day. I loved it!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Awesome movie.  Can watch over and over immediately.  Christian Bale is my favorite Batman!  Excellent performance by all cast memebers

B007ZGBZHE|4.0|In Two Graves, I have to agree with another reviewer that the 'side stories' didn't really lend anything to the book. Besides that, though, Pendergast has become something of an icon in my reading. A sort of James Bond or X-Files for me, where I will always get the next offering and it will deliver in certain respects each time, but at least for me, they have yet to top The Cabinet of Curiosities or Relic.<br /><br />If you've been following Agent Pendergast, there is some resolution to the issue of his marital status and a new twist with his family tree that seemed intriguing, but then again, I'm not sure if they can top Diogenes should they bring back this new wrinkle.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed reading it, but it never put me in the same state that Ice Limit (a Preston/Child colab without Pendergast) did where my wife was trying to show me the view out of a plane window and I was waving her off because what was happening in the book was far more important to me at that point than the view from 30,000 feet.
0307748995|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about very fascinating characters, who is interested in the trauma and the post traumatic effects of war, who likes to read about characters who overcome great obstacles and who are the kind of people you wish you had in our own life as mentors, friends, and neighbors or family.<br />Toni Morrison writes incredibly beautifully. Not a word is wasted. The book is actually quite short, but packed with a fascinating assortment of characters who come to life and are quite fully developed. Morrison is amazingly perceptive and generous in her understanding of the psychology of the most mean and selfish of the characters. Her observations and explanations of behaviors are absolutely sound psychologically. I bought this book fro my book group. Every member loved it. I recommend it without reservation.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I was so excited to read this book since it was listed as a New York Time's bestseller and all the five stars it had received.  I am not a fan of first person storytelling and diary-like entries.  It had moments that were a little interesting, but for the most part, too easy to guess what was next.  It would be a good book for high school girls.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Good story, interesting characters, well acted and directed. Kept my interest and kept a good pace and made me want to know what happened to each person.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I didn't really read the description before purchasing the kindle edition of this book. I was really disappointed when I realized this was a ghost story, as that is something that generally turns me off to a book. I'm glad I made myself give it a try though. This story was touching and funny and all came together really well. The book kept me intrested all the way through.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|There were no aliens/martians, which was too bad... More a documentary of an astronaut. Still a good read. I did enjoy it. only complaint is some of the reading was a little bit technical, not that you need to be a rocket scientist to get it, but those parts would drag. I was really anxious to see what would happen & how it would play out, so all & all I would recommend.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I admit it...I went to the movie first (what else are you going to do when it's -8 outside??).  The movie was mildly diverting so I thought I would try the books, and got the first one (have to read them in order...I know, I know)  Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered Jack Reacher is 6-6 and blonde, not 5-8 and dark.  OK...I can get past the casting decisions, and the humor and violence were there, so I went ahead.  Given this is the first book in a series and has a lot of exposition in it, it was fine.  i will pick up the next couple and see where it all goes...so more, later!

0385737955|5.0|In the Maze Runner, Thomas a 15 or 16 year old teenage boy wakes up in a levitating metal box that comes every 30 days carrying another teenage boy, and  he is very confused to see other people.  When he walks out of the box, he sees people who live in a community.  Outside of this community is a mega maze, like for guinea pigs but much bigger.<br /><br />The maze has giant stone walls that move every night and change patterns.  There are many different ways to die in the maze that's filled with monsters called grievers and that seems like there's a way out of it.<br /><br />Instead of coming thirty days later like that levitating metal box should, it came two days later and that's when everything went completely wrong. Now instead of the walls of the maze covering the big gap between the walls of the 'glade' they stayed perfectly still and, instead of artificial sunlight there was just a gray abyss in what's supposed to be the sky.<br /><br />When this turn of events happened, everything that kept the people alive shut down, and the monsters started to kill one person every night.  When this stuff happened, Thomas went to a \\"cliff\\" that had a secret room with a hidden entrance.  When he was on the \\"cliff\\" he threw a rock that suddenly disappeared in mid-air.  Now Thomas was a very smart guy when it comes to the creators of the maze.  He knew that this must be a way out, or it would unlock the way out.  Thomas found a switch that specifically said \\"Shut down the maze\\" and he flipped it.  He led everyone out to safety.<br /><br />This is the best book I've ever read so far and I'm only nine years old! I really recommend that you read it.

I want to get the nearest experience to what the author originally was thinking).<br />If I had written this when I got the CD, it would be an easy 5 stars.  But due to my laziness, I've come to realize that I own most, if not all of these pieces in different CDs.  However, having them all together is a bonus.

0452281881|5.0|This is one of the very funniest, if not THE funniest book I have ever read.  The glimpse inside the minds of the characters and inside their ad agency through their emails has a ring of truth to it that makes their very bad behavior even more hilarious.  It is not only laugh out loud funny, but occasionally tears running down your face because your'e laughing so hard funny.  If you have any familiarily with the world of graphic design, ad agencies or just send a lot of emails, you'll love it.
0380977273|5.0|Well, you've got to grant that Ray Bradbury is not a boring novelist. The entire story of Something Wicked This Way Comes runs almost entirely on enthusiasm. Part morality tale and part freak show, Something Wicked finds something of a happy medium as an exuberant young adult novel, a wild and unstoppable train of delight in every moment of living. The two protagonists Jim and Will live unimpeded lives without any great danger until the day the Dark Train arrives in the middle of the night, at the witching hour. Unfortunately, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show offers more than mere curiosities and entertainments: it offers your heart's desire... for a price. Are you looking for true love? Your lost youth? Cooger & Dark will give it to you, just take a short ride on this carousel over here.<br /><br />It's easy for a reader to lose the overall geography of the novel in favor of its individual parts. Bradbury's prose oozes with flamboyance and a baroque explosion of literary decoration. Consider this description of a library from the second chapter:<br /><br />\\"Out in the world, not much happened. But here in the special night, a land bricked with paper and leather, anything might happen, always did. Listen! and you heard ten thousand people screaming so high only dogs feathered their ears. A million folk ran toting cannons, sharpening guillotines; Chinese, four abreast, marched on forever. Invisible, silent, yes, but Jim and Will had the gift of ears and noses as well as the gift of tongues. This was a factory of spices from far countries. Here alien deserts slumbered. Up front was the desk where the nice old lady, Miss Watriss, purple-stamped your books, but down off away were Tibet and Antarctica, the Congo. There went Miss Wills, the other librarian, through Outer Mongolia, calmly toting fragments of Peiping and Yokohama and the Celebes. Way down the third book corridor, an oldish man whispered his broom along in the dark, mounding the fallen spices...\\"<br /><br />Arguably, the overall body of the novel takes second place to its members. Bradbury's prose is such a delight to read that you might find yourself surprised to see a story wrapping itself up in the final chapters.<br /><br />But what is this novel? A horror story? An allegory of sin and temptation? An exercise in literary gluttony? I would suggest that it's a little bit of each. The moral, insofar as there is a coherent one at all, concerns the power of a sanguine attitude over the dark despair that comes in the middle of the night when you're tossing awake in bed. The Dark People could be interpreted as embodiments of ennui or despondency, as noonday devils who twist one's head around backwards to glare forever at what he has left behind. They feed on the unhappiness of ordinary people, and have so fed for centuries if not millennia. The fact that laughter has such great power over Mr. Dark and his carnival freaks would support this approach to the story.<br /><br />Most of all, I think that Something Wicked is worth reading for its grab-life-by-the-tail-and-hang-on attitude. It lacks a certain type of literary quality, but makes up for it with spiritedness, like a child who creates a whole imaginative universe using only Legos and crayons. One might need to be in the right mood for this novel, but it's not an unpleasant mood. Not unpleasant at all.><br />Arguably, the overall body of the novel takes second place to its members.

0812550706|4.0|\\"Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth.\\"<br /><br />Orson Scott Card's first story about Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin has remained one of the most popular science fiction stories for young audiences ever since its publication as a novel in 1985. Considered to be one of the best Young Adult science fiction novels, Ender's Game is far better even than Card's own sequels to the novel. The story is simply told--a bragging point for Card in his introduction to the 1991 revised edition, against those who \\"play the game of literary criticism\\"--and its protagonist begins the story at the age of six, making the novel doubly appealing to young readers. It also presents a detailed and believable space-dwelling society, describing simply but thoroughly how life outside our planet might look.<br /><br />The story, for those who don't know it, revolves around the ongoing war with the only known sentient alien species, termed the \\"buggers\\" because of their insectoid appearance. After the buggers' second invasion almost wiped out Earth's military forces, with the humans just barely pulling a victory, the government begins genetically manipulating children in the hopes of creating a military leader strong and intelligent enough to defeat the buggers once and for all. Ender is the third child of his family to be grown this way, leaving him with siblings who are exceptional, but flawed for the military's purposes. Only Ender has the mixture of strength, genius, and compassion needed to make their plans work, so he is chosen as a mere child to begin training at the extra-terrestrial Battle School. It is there that his teachers make him into a weapon to save the Earth.<br /><br />Of particular interest are Card's predictions of future technologies that are surprisingly similar to what we see around us today. The most obvious is the anonymous method of written communication over \\"the nets.\\" Two characters in particular make careers for themselves through pseudonymous writing on the public and electronic discussion groups. The only part of this prediction that seems unrealistic today is the belief that online discussions would ever be taken seriously by politicians. The other prediction is in the immersive electronic Game played by the Battle School children in their free time. Using an avatar to travel around a three-dimensional and fantastic world, solving puzzles and fighting battles in the meanwhile, their Game might as well be a version of World of Warcraft.<br /><br />Ender's Game is not beyond criticism. The novel's plot feeds the natural but immature narcissism of young people by presenting a world that revolves around a brilliant young person rather than insisting on the need for young adults to assimilate themselves to the society which is much older and stronger than they are. (To be fair, this is a common problem in Young Adult novels, possibly the most common.) Even worse, it encourages a deep distrust of adults as cynical overlords who use children--the bright and perfect children--for horrible purposes. As Ender thinks to himself at one point, \\"The most important message was this: the adults are the enemy, not the other armies. They do not tell us the truth.\\" The real world provides enough tension between generations without novelists stirring up further hatred and distrust. Somewhat less annoying is Card's blatant distaste for literary criticism and \\"encoded fiction,\\" which unfortunately serves to make the novel unmemorable aside from its plot and emotional content, as there is no reason ever to go back and enjoy any beautifully-written passages. There's a fine line between wanting to write a straightforward story and being lazy and unimaginative.<br /><br />But despite my reservations, Ender's Game is still one of the most memorable science fiction novels of the last few decades, and its flaws have not prevented its success. It is certainly the best of Card's novels that I've read, and it was clever enough that I didn't even suspect the twist ending until it hit me. A quick read that will never leave you bored, and might even make you think, Ender's Game will undoubtedly remain a Young Adult genre classic for years to come.uspect the twist ending until it hit me.

0380789035|3.0|This is probably Gaiman's most popular novel, and I wish I could share the fans' enthusiasm. While American Gods is certainly both competent and entertaining, I have enough problems with it that I simply don't much care for it as a story. Gaiman's prose style isn't bad, though it is never great, and I would have liked something a little better for a story dealing with such high-minded ideas. But it is the ideas that are the problem, here. Gaiman has written about the survival of ancient, unworshipped gods before and since, especially in his Sandman series and in the later Anansi Boys. The big idea that he repeats in all these works is that gods are beings born out of the collective religious consciousness of a people, that they are phantasms which can exist only so long as they are worshipped, but who still possess what we would think of as godlike powers while they still live. This is hardly a dull idea, even if it is reheated Jungianism, and it's not hard to see why it found such a large audience. Unfortunately, I simply cannot take Gaiman's metaphysics seriously enough to enjoy the novel.<br /><br />Even so, Gaiman imbues his story with some fine, human moments, and he even occasionally recalls his earlier skills as a horror writer. There's a large section of the novel that takes place in an out-of-the-way town and which seems largely inconsequential to the story as a whole, despite a late attempt to tie it back into the main plot. The most entertaining part of the novel is that it makes you want to rummage through your Encyclopedia of Mythology to identify all the gods and demigods who appear.<br /><br />Not a bad read, but hard to take seriously, despite all its sound and fury. Might be worth reading as preparation for the upcoming HBO television adaptation.

0345404475|4.0|Like all of Philip K. Dick's novels, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a strange blend of reality and unreality. It has been a full month since I finished reading the novel, and I've put off writing a review because it's hard to know what to say about it. The basic plot of the book, which survived mostly intact in the film adaptation Blade Runner, has as its protagonist Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter who hunts androids, robotic beings who are indistinguishable from humans except for their total lack of empathy. The lead bounty hunter has been taken down by an android, and this is Deckard's chance to make some money he desperately needs. He proceeds to pick off the androids one by one, and the story ends when his task is complete. Ridley Scott's film used this plot as a vehicle for dystopian and weirdly demonic imagery, and to create a film noir-like mood. Dick uses it like he usually does, as a tool for examining the tension between reality and fantasy.<br /><br />The very first sentence of the book describes a \\"merry little surge of electricity piped... from the mood organ.\\" The mood organ is a tool for controlling emotions, and is a much-desired commodity in a world that is barely surviving after a nuclear catastrophe. If you don't want to wake up in the morning, the organ can make you glad to be awake. If you are depressed, the organ can fill you with bliss. It has the effects of mood-altering drugs without (apparently) any unwanted physical side effects. The other machine which plays a large role in the novel is the empathy box, which is used primarily by followers of a religion called Mercerism as a way of sharing emotions and images with other people who are using the box at the same time. Both machines, notably, are tools for escaping interaction with reality.<br /><br />And reality in the future of Androids is indeed bleak. The nuclear wars have irradiated much of the world, leading to genetic disintegration, mass animal extinctions, and popular immigration movements off-planet to Mars. Animal husbandry is considered a civic duty for those who can afford it, and a moral duty for followers of Mercerism. Those who cannot afford a real animal buy cheaper robotic \\"electric\\" models. The skies are always discolored, entire swaths of continents are wastelands, and ambient radiation transforms intelligent people into \\"chickenheads\\" by rotting their brains. The androids of the novel are not the wonder-experiencing replicants of the film; they are harsh and uncaring, empathizing not even with the death of one of their own. It is no wonder that the inhabitants of Earth escape reality through mood alterations and hallucinogens. Likewise, even the inhabitants of the supposedly nicer Mars seek an escape through the fantastic, adventurous science fiction novels of the past--one thinks of the novels of E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith--because the reality of their situation is hardly like it appeared on the travel ads.<br /><br />Deckard's final triumph is a mixed one. Strange things happen with Mercerism and a vision Deckard has of its supposed founder. Likewise, his path intersects with an animal in such a way that leads to a brave act of acceptance of reality. Reality in this novel, as in all of Dick's novels, is hard, but still worth pursuing for its own sake. The truth is its own reward, despite its difficulties.tion movements off-planet to Mars.

Likewise, even the inhabitants of the supposedly nicer Mars seek an escape through the fantastic, adventurous science fiction novels of the past--one thinks of the novels of E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith--because the reality of their situation is hardly like it appeared on the travel ads.<br /><br />Deckard's final triumph is a mixed one. Strange things happen with Mercerism and a vision Deckard has of its supposed founder. Likewise, his path intersects with an animal in such a way that leads to a brave act of acceptance of reality. Reality in this novel, as in all of Dick's novels, is hard, but still worth pursuing for its own sake. The truth is its own reward, despite its difficulties.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I like special effects so I usually go with this type of sci-fi.  Not really and &#34;edge of your seat&#34; movie like the Alien movies were but really close.
B00AJMTZ50|4.0|Great Album, Great artist.  The only issue I have is if I wanted to hear some bimbo yelling out a song I would have purchased her album.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|I expected more.  I think the best parts were in the previews.  Animation was good though.  Not much else to say.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was on my I pad and i tyed pets the first thing or app I saw was this app I have a kindle fire and I thought I might play it and it is a lot of fun I hope you love it as much as I do
0439023483|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, although it sounded terrible when boyfriend tried to talk me into reading it initially.  &#34;It's really great, it's about kids who have to go to these &#34;hunger games&#34; and either kill or be killed.&#34;  Yuck!!  However, it kept coming up (coworkers, at the bar, etc) and I finally decided to give it a try.  Sucked me in from the first few pages!!  What a quick, great read!!  I liked it so much I went and read the &#34;Gregor the Overlander&#34; series too by the same author (it's aimed at a younger audience, and I'm 32, but I liked that one a lot too!!).  My boyfriend was bored at work and read my copy of the Gregor series too, and he also really enjoyed it (and, besides this series, he really doesn't read much, and definitely not children's books - so that supports the fact that Suzanne Collins is a great writer!!  Really an interesting, compelling storyline.  A must read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box<br /><br />This is a great addition to Connelly's series of Bosch novels.  He solves a murder 20 years after the L.A. riots.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book was suggested to me.  The person that pushed it my way had loved it.  Made claims that it was akin to the Hunger Games trilogy and was in her opinion better than it.  With that being said, I came into this book with high hopes.<br /><br />Even with these high hopes, I was not disappointed. However, I was not \\"stuck on the edge of my seat\\" until well into the book.  I felt there was a good amount of build up that I wasn't really expecting but in the end was pleased that it existed.  Overall, well written with intriguing characters and the mysterious back story and plot is well drawn out making the reader (me) want to continue reading.<br /><br />This book acts like a solo story as well as in the waning chapters sets it up as part of a trilogy.  The book can stand alone.  I have yet to read the next book in the trilogy but I have high hopes that although this individually is an \\"I like it\\" on its own, I believe it will be even better when taken in context of the entire series.  The ending wraps up a lot from within this book but also leaves you wanting to jump immediately into the second book, which is good (unless you don't have the time).
B007AJFSJW|5.0|End This Depression Now!<br /><br />The government should have started programs like the WPA of the 1930s in 2008.  Krugman says &#34;My income is your spending, and your income is my spending.&#34;  it is important to keep people unemployed and public works is one way of doing it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Inspiring and intriguing! Can't wait to go home to continue to read &#34;Me Before You.&#34; Truly a page turner that I've been waiting a long time for. Congrats to author Jojo Moyes.
B009G41CG2|3.0|Ads in the corner distract, and take up paying field space. Tile colors- some are very distinct but most blend in, hard to see. The game functions well and I am happy with it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|An excellent book, hard to swallow and sure to leave you with tears in your eyes. The story pounds forward and feels very much like Dubus' The Garden of Last Days. Very unexpected, but incredibly well done.
B007N8RULO|3.0|The game works very well if you get it to start. Unlike other Spider Solitaire games there is no need to drag cards all the way to the destination. If you touch a card it moves to the best place. If you do drag cards it is sometimes difficult to get them to stay where you put them. The game works well enough and the difficulty level is good enough that I will sometimes play this game instead of the one on my desktop.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My HORSE is kind of boring. I wish it had more to do. But it still gets 5 star's. I got it because my sister has this game so I thought I would try it.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|The app would be perfect if it didn't crash so much.  Even with the occasional crash it is still very good.  I could not pick up any of the looping I heard about from other reviews.  My wife actually used it last night cause she had trouble sleeping and she was out.  That alone was worth it to me.  Overall I would spend $2 on this app if I hadn't got it for free.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|SO AWESOME! I know you bronies out there are afraid to admit it,but you are a bronie and bronies RULE! GET THIS GAME!
B009MCRHH6|1.0|It was dumb I hate it . Never get  it. It has one level and it is no good.  Try a different game!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game has some glitchs, downloaded the new version 1.01.  It wouldnt let me install it over the other one so i had to remove it and reinstall which lost all the progress I had made.  Still crashes sometimes when using the save me feature, and have sometimes fallen through the ground after a jump.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|I don't go to clubs anymore and I really can't dance, so you wouldn't guess this genre of music would appeal to me.<br /><br />Not sure exactly how to explain it, other than noting that the mathematics in deadmau5 music pleases my brain.  There are songs or series of songs that can take me from stressed and unhappy to peaceful and eager for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I would recommend even if you aren't in to trance / dance / house.  This is art with a beat. Well done.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I thought the book was excellent but even after following the instructions step by step I found errors in the downloaded book which I could not reolve even after getting some advice directly from KDP publishing. Ended up having to pay to have my book formatted for Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it and it is stun game. I did not think I wud like it this much cud it is a game that requires. a lot of attn.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm new to tablet gaming, but after I got used to the controls, I really started to like this game.  There are still times when my swipes are misread by the Kindle, but these fails are diminishing as I get more comfortable with the controls.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|So sad when it ended. Great tv drama and very ahead of its time.<br /><br />I will be watching these actors in their future
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the first book, but it left me sad & wanting to get the second book.  What I wasn't prepared for was the emotional roller coaster it put me on.  It was intriguing, exciting, romantic, and completely unexpected.  The ending was not what I wad expecting at all!  I can't wait to get the final book! Well done E.L.!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As every other woman in the world has surely said, it was an excellent book! and my other half was enjoying the benefits on me reading the book, that is for sure.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very happy interesting game, though a bit repetitive at first. The visuals stunning, and I love the feeling of the space being so 3D.
B0034G4P94|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR MAN AND WOMAN.  MY WIFE LOVED IT TOO!  DEFINITLY A  5-STAR MOVIE ABOUT  KICKBOXER FAMILY IN TURMOIL.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Best price around for a classic collectors item now in 3D. You better get it quick before it goes into the vault
B0084TWN9K|5.0|She is the best female short story writer since Flannery O'Connor.  The stories are all bleak, ominous and without any humor.  This must be the terrain of her youth in a Canada that was cold, at war and poor.  I love her stories which are all simple yet powerful
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Disappointed with the outrageous story line and over confident characters.  John Grisham can just sell it with his famous name.
0545265355|5.0|First off let me say that I hardly ever read. Everyone I know was reading these books a year ago but I waited, only buying because I had a gift card. I am so happy that I finally read this trilogy. I could not put the books down!! I read them within 3 days for each book. They are simply amazing. The books are thought provoking, emotional, political, romantic, horrifying and satisfying. I cried many times and it did not turn out like I thought it would, but it was worth the roller coaster of emotions. These may be labeled young adult but really will be loved and appreciated (maybe even more so) by readers of all ages.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I have read many books about Near Death Experiences (NDEs) but this one tops the charts.  This book could literally change how you view life and death and healing.  It has the potential (if you allow it) to change your life and how you view things.<br /><br />I ordered a few copies to give as gifts.  I also started out with ordering it as an e-book then ordering a hard copy for myself because I like special books in that form.<br /><br />Loved it and highly recommend it.<br /><br />Brenda A Elliott, MSW
B00B2V66VS|5.0|.Soo good of a game Mack more like this.<br />Like a 3 !!! So fun  and a 4 to that wold be cool like a dragon or something
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Never really a Trekie, but this was absolutely incredible. I feel anybody would enjoy this movie. . . . .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It was a awesome game it was improved and better then the old one i loved the old one but i really love the new one
B003VS0CYC|4.0|I would give 5 stars to this trilogy but the truth is that I hate the third movie.<br />Robocop 1 is a classic that should be a part of your collection, bloody and gory with violence way ahead for that era. It contains some scenes that were cut in the theatrical version, like the OCP executive being shot by the ED 209 (you can see with details  his body receiving shots in a table) Murphy being shot with greater detail…<br />Robocop 2 is pretty good, although it has some humor that doesn't fit in a movie like this one.<br />Robocop 3 is very very bad, starting with the fact that Peter Weller does not appear on it, and in a scene where robocop got shot with a bazooka, his armor appears to be damaged exactly as in robocop 2. Small details but for me makes a big difference when watching a movie.
0316017930|5.0|The topics discussed in this book are simple enough to understand and can be applied to real life very easily! This story, personally, has made me want to re-evaluate some parts of my life and it has given me a fresh, new outlook on success and what it means to reach a lifelong goal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutley love this game!!! It is fun and addictive! I definatly recommend this app to everyone! You will love Temple Run 2!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was the best one out of the series. There is only 2 words describe this touching and amazing. Suzanne collins has created such a fine series of something so barbaric and sad. There is one thing I think was very touching and that was the epilogue
B00000331V|5.0|An excellent rockin recording by the J. Geils Band. It never gets old. Lot of memories with this cd. Every song great
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Christian is perfect. The story is exciting! Now the sneek peek in Christian's own words would make my life! Hope those books r coming soon!!!
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Good drama with top notch actors. A very tense story to really hold your interest all the way through. I loved it and you will too.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this Dictionary.  It is very accurate and offers many different features.  There is also several games like hangman and other games to improve spelling skills.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book took a while to get into, but after about half way through, it was a very good book and I would recommend any middle school kid, to read this book!
B007EC27QM|3.0|This is a great tool.  I can and have found so many ways to use this calculator.  I think it is a useful app
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a classic, the picture on it is awesome and it keeps my daughter's attention while we watch it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has more things you can do like and one bigger easier monster to runaway from.That's why I love this game
0618154248|5.0|Gotta love curious george.  Got this for my two year old, she loves taking the books out and reading them and then putting them back in the box.
B002RXVOX0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this version. Similar to the Lugosi film, but obviously Langella is a much more romantic Dracula. An excellent addition to my collection of vampire films.
0395389496|5.0|This is for sure one of my most favorite books of all times. It is a perfect addition to our Christmas collection.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Loved the characters. The story was compelling and held my interest. I didn't want to put it down. Great book!
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I used to use the Huey Pro calibrator for yearsss, which I loved because of the simplicity and size. I had to buy the ColorMunki when I upgraded to Mountain Lion on OSX - support for Huey was dropped.<br />This is easy to use and the program is self calibrating (unlike the old Spyder calibrators I tried once years ago).<br /><br />I feel like this calibrates the screen to be just slightly dimmer than the HueyPro did, but still is great. that's just the only thing I noticed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so good it make me wanna slap mi mama . It's so good I wanna slap mi one self when I play this games play to to like 3:00 in the morning . Whoop shoo whoop !!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you like temple run you will like temple run 2! You get realistic characters and get to go down zip lines in the game! Must get game!!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Who knew military guys could write so well?  Great book about a great American!  I highly recommend this along with Marcus Luttrell's &#34;Service&#34; and &#34;Lone Survivor&#34;.  They're all MUST READS!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found Wool by checking the bestsellers list. There, among George R. R. Martin's numerous books, was Wool. I've read Martin's books, so I thought I'd give Wool a try, and I'm happy to say that it absolutely belongs in that list with the best in the genre.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed with Wool was that the books get progressively longer. The fifth book is almost the size of all of the previous books combined, but by the time you get to it you're so invested in the characters, the environment, the story, that you're jumping up and down because the ride is going to take a while.<br /><br />To Hugh,<br />This work was amazing. Thank you.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I really love this app. It's fun and addicting. I can relax and enjoy  while watching my ZOO ANIMALS playing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great trilogy.  Well put together.  E L James did a awesome job.  I will look for other books from James
B005K0S2SW|5.0|I play the trombone and tuba.  I absolutly love the style of his music and the way he performs. I great album.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|An all to rare but, very personal account of  a marines experience of the fighting and the horror of combat in the Pacific during WWII.<br />Anyone with even a passing interest in military history should read this account of combat as experienced by a motorman in a marine rifle company.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a great game and it is harder than temple run.<br />this game is really competive and each level gets harder.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Love this app and don't know what I would do without it. It is so much better than the Amazon Reader. There are more things you can do with it. It is really handy. Get it and see for yourself.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Very impressed.<br /><br />After a small panic that the WeeRide bar wouldn't fit my mountain bike (which has a very large frame), we checked a couple of YouTube videos on installation and the rest was simple.<br /><br />The mounting bar goes on easily, is solid and can remain on the bike even if you're not using the baby seat.<br /><br />The baby seat is very easy to quickly put on and take off as required (less than a minute each way) and seems to be safe and solid.<br /><br />I love being able to see what my child is doing and looking at. As she's currently 18 months old she can't really tell me what she's interested in, but because she's in front of me, I can see where she's looking / pointing. I've been told by friends that when they fall asleep they can just rest in your arms. This hasn't happened yet as she has had far too much fun looking around at the scenery.<br /><br />Additionally, as she's in front of me, I can fend off any branches that might otherwise hit her.<br /><br />I've found that with the baby seats mounted behind the saddle, the bike has a tendency to tip backwards if I'm not on the bike and just wheeling it along / parking it. This doesn't happen with the WeeRide. The central centre of gravity makes the bike really easy to handle.<br /><br />Because the seat itself is so easy to remove, it's ideal for use where you use a bike rack on the back of a car. We've just taken the baby-seat off the bike, put the bike on the bike rack and thrown the WeeRide in the car. As the WeeRide is quite compact it doesn't take up much room in the car.<br /><br />At time of writing, I've had the WeeRide for about a month and have been out 4 times. So far I'm really impressed with it and would heartily recommend it.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This is well written and extremely interesting.<br />Robert Downey Jr. just gets better and better.....<br />Looking forward to the next installment..
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Very enlightening about what it takes to help children succeed in today's world.  I encourage anyone to read this book in order to better understand what the parents can do to prepare their children for the future.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I thought this would have been more information than I already knew. Do not waste the money,<br />Common sense is all you need
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game &lt;3<br />I wish there were more like it.<br />I was so happy when I saw this game and it was under free!
B007XF0X16|5.0|Bought this for my 10 year old son.  He said to give it 5 stars.  It's awesome. Better than the original!!
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Tarantino does it again with this film which is sure to become a classic. I would recommend it to anyone
B003MC5AV2|4.0|Every teenager experiences heartbreak, Penny Lane Bloom, with some help from her friends, help her be stronger. I loved Penny and couldn't put this book down. Being a Beatles fan, I loved it even more.
B0030B624E|5.0|Besides having some great performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson it has Emma Stone in it. What other reason do you  need to watch this?
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this season and can not wait for the next! The depiction of the maltreatment of patients in mental health hospitals was dead on.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The story kept pace with its predecessor. It was exciting and heartbreaking. I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a good book to read.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I have read many of Kate Morton's books and enjoyed them.  The Secret Keeper is her best so far.  As always, the author goes back and forth weaving different stories and historical eras together. The stories take place in contemporary times in England and during the Blitz during WWII following the lives of two women and the repercussions of their actions.In this new book, my interest was held from the first to the last page.  In fact, I couldn't put it down towards the end until I finished.
B00AJMQSP0|5.0|I love Helloween. Their lyrics are just perfect. I was so excited hearing Nabataea on YouTube. Straight Out Of Hell is worth was worth it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I had a hard time in the beginning of the book. Reading about teen sex/relationships was tough for me being a parent of a 17 &12 yr old. However the book had an interesting twist that kept my attention. It was a good story about childhood,friendships,growing up and life struggles. I'm glad I kept reading .
B00B19DMUE|1.0|I didn't get to watch it.  It eveidently didn't download onto my Kindle Fire properly.<br />Back to the drawing board!
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Was wondering how this was only nine dollars. Too good to be true. You get what you pay for. Doesn't work.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|There was not one thing wrong with this movie. My boyfriend and I thought it was very funny, great jokes, etc. The story line was surprisingly good too and nothing boring or any slow parts.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run but temple run 2 is more awesome I like how you ride in mine carts and you get to slid on zip lines and I like the jient spider monkey with only a skull for a head and no eyes.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I begged and begged my boyfriend to watch this movie and was not disappointed, even he was laughing a lot! Sometimes it got a little slow but overall very funny and a good movie. Would buy it on DVD.
B003LSU0K8|5.0|I am very happy with the purchase very good recommend the product and a good price. I hope to buy again thanks
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|ack...had high hopes for this one, but was disappointed...cardboard acting and a plot that kept taking sharp left and right turns made this movie difficult to sit through...let's just say we didn't bother hitting 'pause' when needing a snack or bathroom break...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!!  The story is deep and touching and had me laughing and crying.  The characters are so real and so sweet!
B001KZI2WW|5.0|I have these in Espresso, Back, and Khaki.  I wear these to work and they are super comfortable.  They are light, flexible, and stylish.  They are the perfect blend of casual and dressy from work to church.  I wear a size 9 or 9.5 typically and felt that size 10 was best for me.  Size 9 was just too small.  The price of these are more than reasonable as well on Amazon if you can catch them below $40!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book and this auther are amazing. I have read several of her book and each one is fabulous! The special love these young people have for each other is so perfect and sweet!
1449415881|5.0|There's always a Dilbert Day-to-Day calender on my computer desk. I'm retired, but still enjoy Adams humor. I never read ahead, and every day is new, and a good way to get started.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a great and touching story! Made me laugh and made me cry! I will definately recommend to friends!
B009KHCRVO|4.0|My type of movie because it was goofy, funny, irrelevant, and entertaining.  Added bonus is the science fiction and the special effects were pretty good.  I save the five star rating for really exceptional movies.  So, make some popcorn and escape reality for a while.  I think you will enjoy it.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This landmark series has consistantly delivered superior story, character delevopment, and subtle social commentary about the &#34;golden days&#34; of America in the middle 1950's through (season 5) the middle 1960's. There are no &#34;messages&#34;, but the attention to detail in every facet of production design and art direction, together with an intensely talented ensemble cast effectively rubs stratified American society's nose in its posturing behaviors.<br />If you have not experienced this infuriating, embarrasing, riviting and entirely fascinating series, run, don't walk to your nearest remote.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|Moran tries to navigate a sexist world with self-deprecating humor and brutal honesty.  This book is certainly not for prudes, but it's worth a read.  Don't expect too many answers, though.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I was looking for some definitive results or facts.  Felt the book was written on a level way beyond common man.  Did not prove anything to me.  Left me hanging.  Do not rx book
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Really fun and challenging. Just a little better than the first edition. More challenging. The graphics are really cool. Now I'm playing both versions!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Such an addictive game. Fun for every member of the family. Play with the kids for hours or when the kids are asleep.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love having this, so convenient. Instead of me going into my office and pulling out the HUGE dictionary on my shelf I just grab my Kindle Fire and look up any word. Very handy!
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I like the quick and easy meals.  It should update more often.  But overall a great little app to have on your phone.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|So much better than Angry Birds. I love that you have to use strategy to get the pig moving! It gets tougher as you complete each level.
0452295548|5.0|I got this for my dad.  He didn't have a stroke.  I got it for him because I saw the author on TED and her story is just so amazing.  I thumbed through the book and hope my dad will loan it to me.  It arrived on time of course... Amazon never lets me down.
B00701L5XS|5.0|We are avid boater. This is fun to practice all the knots and to refresh yourself on what knots are needed in many situations. Fun for kids to learn and the graphics are so helpful.
B000077VR3|5.0|Someone told me they could not get into this movie once. It is true it takes awhile but once you do you are blessed with a great story.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|very funny movie.  The singing is entertaining and the characters are memorable.<br />Would recomend to all my friends to see this movie.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Great app! it was worth the 3 bucks for sure! I play this on the computer and this is even better than the computer version! I'm telling you guys get it!
B00328R21C|5.0|Pros:<br />- Fun to build, fun decorative piece or toy.<br />- Comes with instructions for easy guided assembly<br />- All figures included are pristine in detail and appearance, very happy with the minifigs.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Difficult to clean dust if kept out for display, something good to keep in mind; best works if you soak it and then clean with a sponge to get in crevices.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I enjoy assembling Lego sets and keeping them as cute little decorative pieces for our apartment. The Landspeeder was a great addition to our various Star Wars sets at a great price. :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am seven and love horses. This is my favorite game. It is fun and challenging. You really should try it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I hate it because I got 3000 point's and it went away but it's ok<br /><br />Lost a lot of money but ok
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|FUN GAME FOR ALL AGES GRANDKIDS LOVE IT Cannot wait for coins to accumulate again.  Need more power coin.  E Cheryl
B008QOH1NG|5.0|Let me begin by saying I just received my DVD today. I finished watching it and I am 100% satisfied! I have been a \\"Stryper\\" fan faithfully since their EP release \\"Yellow and Black Attack\\" in 1984. I have seen them when they where huge and also later and have never ever been let down. These guys just plain throw down and always have! This DVD sounds great! Has a real good mix for the sound. I thought I would miss the 5.1 Surround Sound but it sounded so good I can't complain. The live footage is shot very good and covers all members unlike alot of other videos I have seen by other bands. \\"Stryper\\" has always been incredible musicians as well as people and CAN HOLD UP TO ANY BAND ANY TIME. \\"Michael Sweet\\" and \\"Oz Fox\\" are simply one of the best guitar duo's you will ever see or hear. It is awesome having \\"Tim Gaines\\" back in the band after the short stint without him because he is an amazing bass player and singer. \\"Robert Sweet\\" of coarse is one of the coolest drummers ever and is rock solid still to this day. The band sounds very tight as they have been every concert I have seen. I do want to address some of the reviews about \\"Michael's\\" singing. People have said he can't hit the notes like he used to. This is what I suggest to those people. You might want to take another listen because \\"Michael\\" hits his trademark highs very well just for instance on the ending of \\"The Way\\" \\"To Hell With The Devil\\" and check out his excellant vocal intro for \\"Soldiers Under Command\\" with the croud and again smoking vocal ending for that song. \\"Michael\\" has always sang with the croud and let the croud sing. The reason is because the fans like the band so much and he gets them into it. Why not let them join in the fun. \\"Michael Sweet\\" is one of the coolest lead guitar front men bar none still to this day and still has an incredible voice. If you like Stryper do yourself a favor and buy this because you will love it. My son who is 16 grew up listening to Stryper and his words to me after was that they are one of the best live bands he has ever seen and couldn't believe how tight they were. Very cool DVD! I wish they had a CD of this also.fter was that they are one of the best live bands he has ever seen and couldn't believe how tight they were. Very cool DVD! I wish they had a CD of this also.
B0052REUW0|5.0|I have to say, this book heavily influenced my last two sermons at my church (I'm a pastor), and think that his perspective is highly valuable and important in today's society which is bogged down with jaded cynicism, anxiety and a lack of perspective on history. Viewing our past honestly and realistically is crucial to understanding our present and having hope for our future.<br /><br />The book is long and academic, which I enjoy, but his argument consists of two basic points -- exposing the past as depraved, and viewing the present in perspective of how things were and not how we think things ought to be. While dark reading at times, ultimately it is uplifting and optimistic about the tremendous progress humanity has made and is still capable of.<br /><br />Dr. Pinker's book leans heavily on the ideas of Hobbes and Kant, and is a push-back to some of the dogmas of post-modernity. As someone sympathetic to post-modern thought, I didn't expect to enjoy and agree so much with Dr. Pinker, who for his part fairly addresses the criticisms and concerns of his contemporaries in academic circles. As someone with a philosophy background, though, I have always found Enlightenment philosophy and humanism compelling.<br /><br />As a pastor, and hearing his TED talk before reading the book, I assumed I would find his views on religion obnoxious. However, his views on religion are harsh but not entirely unfair or indefensible, and are more measured and reasoned than I expected from someone so ardently atheist (and humanist). Then again, I'm a progressive Christian who isn't as defensive about the Bible and its many violent and morally bankrupt episodes, but rather see them within the context of the historical tradition of our faith which informs us but does not bind us. I'm also literate enough to not be caught by surprise that genocide and human sacrifice figure prominently in my faith's history.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|After listening to Emmy Rossum's new cd I can't help but wonder why a no talent hack like Taylor Swift continues to rake in millions by releasing the same horrible song over and over again. If you want to hear a REAL voice check out this cd. Emmy's version of \\"Things\\" is a pop delight and have a box of kleenex ready when you listen to \\"Autumn Leaves\\" because you'll be crying like a baby! Her vocal range is incredible and she handles every musical style with ease. This is what a true singer is all about. It's very rare to hear this kind of talent<br />nowadays. Stop wasting your hard earned cash on no talent fools and go for the real deal. Not a bad song in<br />the bunch and easy on the eyes too!!

067003830X|4.0|Human Beings can think about thinking, my philosopher son is training to make a career out of exercising that discipline.  Until recently, how we \\"thought\\" (the process by which we do any and everything) was a matter of where that \\"process\\" was stored within the brain (termed Localization) and that region was responsible to accomplish that specific task (e.g. talking, hearing, processing, etc.).  Were that area damaged or destroyed that function ceased to exist.  Due to innovative thinking, advanced medical research equipment and an awareness of possibility, the reality that the brain is \\"plastic\\" (changeable, ever learning) rather than a \\"machine\\" (each part doing one thing within the whole) is proving to be a more accurate description of this wondrous organ.<br /> Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist deeply rooted in Freudian Theory, has been studying and utilizing the concept of \\"Brain Plasticity\\" for over 20 years.  His research (well documented, the pages of notes number over half that of the pages contained in the body of the book) has revealed that much of what was \\"known\\" about brain function is wrong.  Whereas the brain was thought to be compartmentalized and rigid in those functional assignments, it is now expected that the brain is ever evolving in response to new experiences, stimuli and learning opportunities.  This \\"plasticity\\" keeps those who exercise and challenge their brain younger in functionality and clarity.<br /> Plasticity also disproves the notion that the brain is elastic (it \\"snaps back\\" to its old shape/pattern) after ANY experience occurs, as each experience creates new neurological pathways.  A single experience creates such a pathway; repetition enforces them to the place of them becoming \\"normal.\\"  In this endeavor the term, \\"use it or lose it\\" is specifically apt as the more one uses a neurological pathway the better one makes use of that pathway and the stronger it becomes - the less it is used the weaker it becomes until it ceases to be.  This is due, in large part to the brain's efficient use of space and resources.  It's use it or lose it practice is tempered by the brain's having developed a system of competition within itself whereby the pathway formed is best suited to continued learning and functionality.<br /> There is so much of import and Dr. Doidge suggests, with near voluminous documentation, such awe-inspiring instances of the brain changing itself, along with the potential for future applications of this knowledge that one reading of this tome is but a shallow (and it is NOT a shallow book) introduction to this field.  Issues such as: blindness, deafness, \\"phantom limb\\" pain and dementia have, by his report, been successfully treated by using the brain's astonishing capacity to learn.  There is hope, according to Dr. Doidge, for the like treatment of severe mental illness (i.e. schizophrenia, intractable depression, etc.) can be just as successfully treated once we can learn how to retrain those brains.<br /> This is a book that takes time to read.  Much of it discusses scientific issues that, in lesser hands, could be boring or obscure, but the author does a good job of being clear while discussing issues that are difficult.  Dr. Doidge is aware that, while much good can come from learning more about the brains ability to learn and our ability to retrain it, there is room for such knowledge to lead to horrific ends.  There is nothing to offend contained in the book, a part from it raising a sound argument against generations of accepted medical \\"knowledge.\\"<br /> Having recently read Dr. Taylor's My Stroke of Insight and Dr. Eagleman's Incognito and now this book, I have had to deeply reconsider what I have been taught about the function of the brain and how I treat those with whom I sit in a clinical setting.  It is hopefully a shift that will bring continued healing in those lives.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I heard about this book from friends and the content  it had, and was skeptical. After reading  it, it truly is interesting, but it's also a love story. Thought it was a good book overall.
0385528752|5.0|Reading any well thought-out, research-based, mass produced book is an exercise in learning.  The planning is shown in how the research is presented (logical, pedagogical, direct, easily understood without being condescending) and is presented to \\"the masses\\" in support of \\"a rising tide lifts all boats\\" attitude (those reading will think differently when they are finished).  To find a book that fulfills this criteria is a joy and leaves me with a renewed thirst for knowledge.  Having read the Heath brother's previous cooperative effort (Made to Stick), my expectations of this Leadership/Business/Relationship volume were high and those expectations were exceeded.<br /> Dan and Chip Heath are academics (Duke and Stanford, respectively) but speak as if what they had to say would benefit those outside the Ivory Towers of higher learning.  This work is presented in an accessible manner, with the premise that change can occur, regardless of the resistance toward change, if one understands what is required for changes to be made.  Simply stated, we do what we do because we feel like it (the behavior is \\"comfortable,\\" irrespective of the pain it causes).  Anyone can decide to act/behave differently for a short period, until the emotional reaction to that behavior becomes too uncomfortable to be sustained.  The authors describe change as being facilitated by: thinking differently, finding the emotional \\"reward,\\" and/or making the change easier to achieve.<br />To make these three concepts more memorable, they use the illustration of riding an elephant in the jungle.  The Rider (the mind) can control the Elephant (the emotions) as long as the elephant is agreeable.  The trip (change) will be more successful if the rider and elephant follow a path that is comfortable for the elephant and well defined by the rider.<br />The authors use real-world examples (\\"clinics\\" inserted throughout the book), illustrations that are applicable and concepts that seem more commonsense than revelatory.  The authors have a realistic view that change IS difficult, but it does not have to be impossible, regardless of what that change is and it can often begin with a relatively small change in either the Rider, the Elephant or the Path.<br />I see this book being useful in my work by helping those with whom I sit to imagine another way to view the issues which brought them into the process.  Typically, change begins when one imagines things can be different and starts to \\"see\\" how that difference could possibly occur or glimpses a way to locate the change they wish.  Given the \\"elephant rider on the jungle path\\" idea is repeated at least every sub-chapter it will be one easily remembered as the behavior modification is being accomplished.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Excellent read for any age.  A great book about getting banged up and appreciating the dents we all have in our lives.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|The study of the brain is in its infancy.  Some researchers have indicated that we understand as much about the function of the human brain today as we understood the functions of the computer in the early 1900's.  Jill Bolte Taylor was on the leading edge of that learning as a Neuroanatomist at Harvard Medical School.  She knew what different parts of the brain did and had a good grasp upon how those parts did what they did while daily learning more of those processes.  This was true until 7:00 the morning of 10 December 1996 when she suffered a massive stroke in the left hemisphere of her brain.  For the next eight years she worked to restore what was lost on that morning in December.  The book deals intensely with the first days after the stroke and she is eloquent in this narrative, particularly when she speaks of the first four hours of the event.  The last half of the book speaks to what she learned, or the \\"insights,\\" she gained from the A.V.M. (Arteriovenous Malformation) stroke and those lessons are dramatic, to say the least.<br />When Dr. Taylor awoke that morning, she \\"knew\\" something was \\"off\\" in her body.  For the next four hours she scientifically observed herself having a major stroke.  When she realized what was occurring, when her right arm fell to her side, she remarked to herself, \\"Oh my gosh, I'm having a stroke! . . . . Wow, this is cool! (p. 44).  The opportunity of  a well educated, highly intelligent, extremely articulate scientist having VERY original research into her field of expertise is a gift, one she is sharing with the world.  Dr. Taylor delivers that gift in a straight forward, easily read manner.<br /><br />Her account of the things she learns as a result of the stroke is akin to reading a report of people who are advocates of meditation or are deeply Spiritually attuned.  She speaks as a trained observer, not a devotee of any religious sect, yet her observations speak of her experiencing \\"being at one\\" (p.41), \\"a state of peacefulgrace\\" (p.43), \\"tranquility, safety, blessedness, euphoria, and omniscience\\" and a \\"yearning to be released completely form the captivity of this physical form, which throbbed with pain\\"(p.49).  Those moments were experienced by her as, and because of, the stroke occurred, damaging extensively the left hemisphere of her brain, leaving the right hemisphere to function freely.  As the right hemisphere is the seat of connection, nonlinear thinking, timeless experience and seeing \\"the big picture,\\" her experience of the stroke reflects those qualities, which are the qualities similar to religious experience.<br />Dr. Taylor now insists that her \\"being one with all\\" is only a thought away.  As she recovered the functions of her left hemisphere, she used her new knowledge to refuse those traits she had before the stroke (intense anger, pettiness, jealousy, holding grudges, etc.), seeing them as a useless drain on her energy.  She offers that everyone can cease those behaviors as well, using only what is readily available to all - their brains.  The results of doing so can be amazing, life changing, mystical, almost magical.  But it is not magic, it is science.<br />This makes the discussion of religious experience versus scientific evidence especially pointed.  As more evidence of the \\"religious brain\\" becomes more available, those of us who are \\"of the household of faith\\" could be seen as having little choice in believing, as we have a brain that is predisposed to that behavior.  However, Dr. Taylor's insights support the understanding that all have a choice in how each will act/believe.  She could have renewed her old habits of anger, jealousy, etc., she chooses not to, understanding that she could behave differently than her brain was telling her, as she learned \\"that there are enormous gaps between what I know and what I think I know\\" (p.144).  Irrespective of chemistry or belief, it is dependent upon the individual to decide how she/he will live.  In the language ofFreud (science) are we predisposed but not limited to certain behaviors or do we have to behave in certain way because \\"that is how we were made,\\" and in the language of Zion (faith), are we predestined to (or against) faith or do we have freewill?  The debate deepens.

006097625X|5.0|McCloud knows his stuff, and his stuff is comics. Never have I read the words of a man who loves comics as much as I do (if not more!). He has a very objective approach though, and treats comics as it should be treated: its own medium. And by using a comic format for the entire book, he further legitimizes the art form. And despite his high-minded approach, he also does not fall into the pitfalls of insulting the genres that have dominated the comic scene. He is not just a grumpy old man with a narrow view on what can make comics great. He pushes for improvement and evolution in the art form, but not by smashing the stepping stones to get there.<br /><br />Overall, a great and informative read. It was hard to put down. Thank you very much, Mr. McCloud.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I picked up Perks on my Kindle after hearing about the movie (but not having seen it).  I tend to really like books that are narrated in interesting ways and it had been a while since I had read a book that was told through letters.  Charlie's voice in this book rings so true to the awkwardness of being a teenager who, as you start to discover, is awkward because he is so smart in so many ways; socially he struggles.  I think what I liked best about this book is that it unflinchingly looked at how high school was in the 90s (which was when I was in HS) and the struggles that teenagers go through.  I could relate to the characters in a lot of ways, despite never having been in many of the situations that the characters were in.  To me, that is the sign of a good book- being able to relate because the experience of being a teenager is less about exactly what happens to each character, but the feeling and emotions that accompany the teenage or life experience of a character in general.<br /><br />Overall I really liked this book and found myself very emotionally attached to Charlie and his honesty about himself, his family, his friends and his experience.  I think the author's choice to tell the story via letters that Charlie writes to a person was brilliant and truly made the book better.

0062225715|3.0|Mort is about Death, and Death's apprentice, Mortimer (Mort for short).  The plot is pretty simple:  Death takes an apprentice and teaches him the ropes and lets him go out on missions to gather the souls of the dead.  Mort does pretty well but falls for a princess whose soul he is supposed to harvest, and instead of collecting her soul Mort kills the assassin who was supposed to kill her, and thus saves her life and interferes with destiny.  Destiny will repair itself in about a week's time by killing the princess anyway and reasserting events with Mort's little bungle edited out, and the race is on for Mort to try to find a way to save the princess for good while not admitting to Death what he did.<br /><br />In the meantime, Death has been feeling down lately and is looking for a change.  He tries line dancing, and gambling, and getting drunk, and can't see the point in any of these activities.  Finally he becomes a short-order cook, which makes him happy.  He abdicates his duties as Death, leaving Mort and his allies to figure out the full scope of Death's responsibilities in a big hurry and then to carry them out.  Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on the princess, who is about to die a second time.  Can Mort find a way to save the princess for good, while fulfilling his responsibilities as Death's apprentice and honoring his allies and friends?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book right up to the end, which is rushed and doesn't do a very good job of sorting out the book's love triangle.  Things just suddenly tie themselves up and come to a hasty resolution, which feels forced and unnatural.  There are a lot of chuckles in this book, so it's worth it as a read, but this is a minor Pratchett work that is barely worth reading.

B008VNI9IS|5.0|In the second act I had the strange feeling that I was watching Callas.  Except that in this performance, not only does Dessi look like Callas, but her voice has a similar rich, intensity and her acting is even more moving.  I know this sounds like blasphemy, but I don't make the statement lightly.  In all fairness, I should point out some lacks in this version.  First, because this is a live performance, some of the make-up while appropriate for the stage, is overdone for the close-ups of video.  Same goes for coming in for a close-up of the dead Claudio Squra visibly still breathing after being knifed by Dessi.  But these are quibbles.  Overall a very special, high resolution blu ray production in a traditional staging and setting.<br /><br />By the way, because this is a live performance in front of a very knowledgeable and appreciative audience, something extra happens in the second act, then again in the third.  I don't want to spoil your delight or surprise by telling you what, but be prepared for something rare and wonderful!

1451678193|5.0|When I wrote my novel [[ASIN:B0099X0E8C The Merry Life of Charles Parker]] I turned again and again to Ray Bradbury for a guide -- I wanted to write a realistic portrayal of 12-year-old boys. My book is set in 1959 and Bradbury wrote these stories in the 1940s, but they've been popular ever since. I wasn't around in the Fifties so I had to rely on popular culture to give me a sense of some of the dreams and nightmares seizing American minds at the end of Eisenhower's presidency. If a kid was at all interested in science fiction back then he would have absorbed some of these stories. Bradbury was everywhere. Bradbury *was* popular culture. From Mars to Moby Dick to Fahrenheit 451 to his many other strange and wonderful stories -- he was the one writer Americans couldn't get out of their heads.  And still you can read the stories in this slim volume as great pieces of powerful literature, but you can also read them as bits of evocative history. What did people think about space exploration decades ago? Or about aliens living on Mars? Or about the future of life on Earth? Was there fear of the atomic bomb? Oh, yes. Was there fear that mankind might be its own worst enemy? You decide. It's all here in haunting detail. The language is always crisp. Bradbury was an autodidact with the need to impress -- and he never disappoints. Because of Ray Bradbury American history is never a dull subject. It's a history of nervous energy and restless imagination.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Why Neeson continues to take on roles in B movies is beyond me.  This thing reeks from the get-go, and is inaccurate in so many ways it's hard to know where to begin.  First off, there is no alcohol allowed on the North Slope.  Secondly, his plane goes down and somehow they are able to find a forest on the Arctic Plain, which is barren.  And of course The Man won't come to look for them because he's, you know, The Man.  Worse, there are wolves exhibiting behavior that no wolf has ever exhibited.  And what was with the wolves roaring like lions?  I like an action film as much as the next couch potato, but this turkey gives &#34;bad&#34; a bad name.

B001RP1G0U|4.0|this silly sojourn takes the hungry heart on a semi fulfilling journey, where the protagonists eventually, gladly come together in the end, but there is an air of assuming in the end like the writers and the director phoned it in--they hug and act married in two scenes in the end, but it left me yearning...the fathers poem was memorable--brown penny, brown penny...I'm a perpetual diane lane and cusack fan--they seem to choose worthy projects- this story is campy, but what the hell.  john's character at the time I first saw this paralleled mine in the hands-on shop/wood aspect, except that his shop was dust free.  picky, picky.  It works, at least for me-- its a classic in my library now.
6300274195|5.0|the musical numbers are off the hook, the animation is soooo creative and wonderful. the 'pink elephants on parade' bit, and the section with the blackbirds up the tree that follows it are pure genious. i love this, and i don't even have kids. i NEVER cry at movies, either, but that scene wherein Dumbo visits his mom in elephant jail gets me every time. every. damn. TIME!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun and keeps you entertained.  I can play when I want without losing progress. I. Love taking care of the horses.  Great app!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had read other reviews and was worried.  However, this was a FABULOUS ending to the series.  There were some twists and turns I was not expecting.  Over all, I was very happy with the series.  I couldn't put this book down at night!  For someone looking for a fairy tale ending though, this is not the book for you.  I don't think this series started out with an expectation of all turning out peachy though.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again, super agent Mitch Rapp does what he does best - finds the bad guys and eliminates them, against all odds.  I couldn't put this one down!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|love the game its great but sometimes it cuts off when I touch to use a jewel to continue. other than that I love it. No other issues. Graphics are nice love the streams and waterfalls... Really love the cart and jewel tunnels!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|cmon---we know this one---gotta see a movie when the model T was a baby.  A world standard, like the sound of music. I fear that our present secretary of states' subliminal popularity can be attributed to the wonderful appeal of shirley jone's likeness [h. clinton] Sad!!! ABSOLUTELY no comparison!!! preston cant be followed in this awesome project. a high bar is set that no one will surpass. the sadder but wiser girl for me!
B00026YO36|5.0|as far as i'm concerned. love everything he's touched since the screaming trees, except that collaboration with what's-her-face (her name is listed, too).  even the kid's songs. his voice and soul would make the alphabet sound good. not  'good mood' music, tho--just so you know.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|It is a great tv series nice to watch it all in a couple nights and not over weeks good price and quick delivery
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this is a great addicting game that deserves the 4 to 5 stars that people give it! I love the graphics and the fact that you have to have quick reflexes. again, great job imangi studios!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|We don't have cable but have Amazon Instant streaming on our Xbox 360. Much cheaper to pay by episode the nights we don't make a Walking Dead night at a friends house than to get cable
B000022TSH|3.0|jack nails it as usual--faye is stellar as is john huston.  gritty symbolism reveals a foggy realism of what the world is really like, at least in old california--like the big hat squad of the lapd in the 50's.  like nick nolte in mullholland falls. and LA confidential with cromwell and crow and basinger.  the sequel is the two jakes which is a must see.  keitel works it
1582701709|1.0|threw this in my cart after someone told me about it and raved and raved. that person, it turns out, is a simpleton. i had just met them at the time. more idiotic than scientology. lame-o motivational pap that no one with a brain in their head needs. i turn it spine in on the bookshelf, because i don't want anyone to see that it's there.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm addicted! I think I like it better then the first temple run. I really do like the mines and the ropes and all the special features or has.. I recommend this fame to everyone!

B00B2V66VS|2.0|When I got the app it was awesome one of the best games I've had so far on my kindle! After I have played the app a bunch of times I got the second character and exited the app. The next time I tried to play it, it wouldn't open! I uninstalled the game and tried to reinstall it. For some odd reason my kindle still thinks that I have the game! If Imangi Studios can fix this problem (I have seen another review similar to mine) the game would be perfect.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is super fun. Almost impossible to get very far but I can't stop playing. Has anyone ever beat it?
B004GVUPFE|1.0|I think my title pretty much sums up what I thought about this game. Mostly I like puzzle games but this one, for some reason, did not meet my, possibly very high, expectations. All I can suggest is try it out for yourself, and you can decide if you like it or not.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and i love playing it! It really passes the time while at an appointment or just missing the family farm
B001AG52AG|5.0|I saw this movie a few years ago and remembered about it and I absolutely love it! Such an awesome movie!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This one seemed a little too contrived.  While the writing is polished, the plot suffered from too many painful twists.

B008QCBFHG|5.0|The historical Alexander the Great had no guns nor explosives; warfare on his campaigns would have been easy on the ears by Hollywood standards. Such audible restraint had no appeal for Handel or his London audience, so the overture and the several symphony-interludes in this rousing opera from 1726 are replete with percussion and military themes. The scene of the story is near the outer limit of Alessandro's conquests, with India already subdued. Alessandro has begun to suffer delusions, imagining himself to be the Son of Jove. The libretto is based, indeed, on a story titled La Superbia d'Alessandro, The Megalomania of Alexander.<br /><br />But Alessandro is not the focus of dramatic attention in this opera named for him, although his role was composed for the celebrated castrato alto Senesino and thus inevitably includes a series of spectacular virtuosic arias. The real drama is the rivalry of two women, one a slave and the other a barbarian, for the love of Al. Handel had somehow managed to finagle two of the finest divas of the era, Faustina Bordoni and Francesca Cuzzoni, to sing the roles of Rossane and Lisaura. Their real-life bitter rivalry insured that the onstage tension would be high, a situation that required Handel to balance the roles with exquisite tact. Each aspirant gets two arias in all three acts of the opera, and their arias are the lengthiest and most flamboyant. Isaura's are the darker and more furious while Rossane's are sweeter and more bird-like, preparing our ears for her eventual \\"victory\\" as Alex's chosen amour. Isaura is rewarded, however, with the devotion of Tassile, Al's most loyal supporter and the heir to the Indian portion of the Alexandrine empire. Isaura and Rssane share a duet at the end of Act I, while several of the extended accompanied recitativos are also their duets. The final scene of the opera allots each soprano a brief duet with Alessandro, followed by a trio with chorus.<br /><br />Alessandro is sung by male alto Max Emanuel Cencic, whose acclaim on the modern opera stage is beginning to approach that of the original Senesino himself. Cencic is superb but, as the opera requires, he's upstaged by the rival sopranos, Karina Gauvin as Lisaura and Julia Lezhneva as Rossane. It would surprise me if a touch of rivalry really didn't inspire the two singers to the brilliance of this performance, Gauvin the established HIPPstar and Lezhneva the early-twenties newcomer. Gauvin is gorgeous of timbre and affect, but Lezhneva excels in agility and purity of technique. There's no difficulty in distinguishing their voices, or Cencic's, on the recording. Read through the libretto (enclosed in Italian and English translation) or just the synopsis, and then settle back to enjoy the music without further concern for the drama! That's what audiences of 1726 would have done. The notes for this CD include anecdotes of the rumpuses that broke out between the supporters of Bordoni and Cuzzoni, as well as a several page essay about the real Alexander and the relationship between history and operatic imagination.<br /><br />This 3-CD release was deservedly proclaimed one of the \\"Ten Best\\" opera recordings of 2012 by Opera News Magazine.manuel Cencic, whose acclaim on the modern opera stage is beginning to approach that of the original Senesino himself.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|We are very much involved in the lives of these characters.  We make a special dessert each Sunday evening to celebrate Masterpiece Theater and Downton Abbey.  Actually, we watch the DVD when nothing else is worth watching on TV.  As you might suspect, we have much of the dialogue memorized!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is most enjoyable and fascinating to watch. I have fallen in love with the characters. The story lines are great especially how they set apart the two worlds, the Granthams and the staff yet enter twine the plots and story line superbly.  It has compassion, love, romance, humor and seriousness all wrapped into one.  Thanks so much to the writers, directors, actors, and all the people who work so hard to incorporate such fine work for a great series to television.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning. The characters are so easy to relate to. Great job by the author.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I have read so I can't compare to his previous works.  I found the book so easy to read and I could &#34;see&#34; what he was describing.  The book was written in such a way that I HAD to make time to read every day.  It was easy to get lost in the book as the author is very descriptive in his style of writing.  I can't wait to read more of his books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Make sure you read all 3 books. I really wish there were more but i guess i have to get back to the real world now.......lol I read all 3 books within a month and i have a full-time job so of course i went out my way just to read these books.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, but the sequence of events seemed a little to similar to Twilight. I finished this book within three days of buying it. I am dying to read the rest of the series!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I love all the actors in this movie, very entertaining. Action movies are some of my favorite to watch always.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I bought this book after reading lots of five star reviews and I just had to read it in one sitting. This Robinson Crusoe goes to Mars novel is extremely entertaining, fast paced and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the action.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really wish there were more than 3 books..........I couldnt stop reading it and its helped me thru some really boring nights
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is far and away our favorite show on television. The first season is even better, but this was great also.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My girls love horses and this game allows them to see just a little bit of the hard work it takes to care for them. This works out well for me since I'm not buying them a really horse anytime soon. I hope you can cont improving on an already good game
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is what a sequel should be... I really enjoy playing it because of better graphics and awesome gameplay.
1616550414|5.0|This big, wonderful book is better than I imagined. It's full of beautiful artwork and information about all of the Zelda games, and a must-have for all Zelda fans. Its a great buy, really. I'm glad i bought it, I truly love it. (:
0345803507|1.0|I'm done.<br /><br />I intended to come back and write another angry review and tie off some loose ends from my other two reviews.  I meant to have fun with it.  But I just can't.  I hate this book.  It's so awful.  I'll get on Wikipedia and read the synopsis to find out how it ends and close this book for good.<br /><br />I've labeled this book (this series, really) as an important step in my reading for a reason.  This series made me wake up and realize that I've been very cavalier in my reading choices lately.  I've been reading pop-literature with no regard to quality, books with lots of sex trying to get some kind of thrill.  No more.  This book hurt me in a way that's hard to define.  It damaged my sensibilities, my sentimentality.  If it had been dark, if it had been edgy, if it had been of greater substance, it would have been a great addition to my list of books read.  This book is empty of anything of value, and I don't know why it got to me the way it did.  It's changed me for the better in that I'll stick to good books from now on and not read trash.<br /><br />The Fifty Shades trilogy is beneath me and I can't waste my time and mind on lesser books.<br /><br />Duces.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I love this series. I'm rereading it to catch up with the last books. Keeps you reading! I can barely put it down!
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|This classic is the best Christmas movie! Great actors, great story line, and very uplifting. It's also fun to see the actors used in other movies of the time- kids and taxi driver from  It's A Wonderful Life, for example.<br />Cary Grant and David Niven are wonderful and it's hard to imagine that originally the studio wanted their roles to be reveresed!
B00000J7S8|4.0|Diana Krall is one of the best artists out there today.<br /><br />Each song is worth the purchase of the cd.

B00005JN4H|3.0|As expected, a little over the top but still a funny movie. We enjoyed watching it. At points a little annoying.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|A great continuing to the first book! Couldn't put it down! On to book three to continue the ongoing suspense!:)
B000002KHF|5.0|Every Song on this cd is worth listening to. sometimes you like an artist and buy their cd and you end up liking maybe half or three quarters of the cd but on Moondance every song is a hit!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is awesome.  I even like the handle which many complained about.  Not that slippery even in Florida humidity.  This is one big boy knife.  The sheath is ok I will be replacing the nylon part of it with leather.  The kydex is great though.  You need this knife.  Don't spend hundreds on a knife get this one, but get it from Amazon best price around.

B004SUDQE0|4.0|This is a delightful, low-key witty film focussed on the foibles of the Welsh nation; it's also a tale of romance. Two archetypal early 20th century Englishmen, Reginald Anson (Hugh Grant) and George Garrad (Ian McNiece), are sent as cartographers on behalf of the Ordnance Survey to measure the height of a mound in a Welsh mining village. The mound in question - Ffynnon Garw - is regarded with great pride by the locals as their characteristic mountain. For those not familiar with the typography of Wales, there are a lot of mountains here and each community is very proud of their local mountain (or occasionally, beach). So when the surveyors find the Ffynnon Garw is a few feet short of a mountain (just under 1000 feet), the locals set to and carry buckets of earth to the top so that it is over 1000 feet. This may sound like a ridiculous story, but the humour is all in the telling and those who tell it. Having succeeded in building up their hill, the community is dismayed when the local rain washes some of the earth away that they have transported so laboriously. For those not familiar with the climate of Wales, rain here closely resembles that of the Indian monsoon season. So the locals have to set to again and cart some more earth up the hill. In the process of communing with the locals, Anson falls in love with a local girl, Betty from Bardiff (Tara Fitzgerald), so it all ends happily -though sadly, it all proves too much for the local vicar, Reverend Jones (Kenneth Griffith), who is fittingly buried on his mountain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My niece will play this for hours and absolutely loves it! Definitely deserves a great rating for keeping a 4 year old girl entertained for that long.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just like the characters Sky and Holder, I experienced every emotion there is. I laughed, cried, was angry and sad. There was passion - got to love it! I couldn't put the book down.  I recommend this book, but not for a light read
B008KL2ITW|5.0|Although this book is about a couple in high school do not let it out you off buying it, i could not put this book down and I am 30+, really enjoyable and I look forward to the sequel.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|You know all those shows on cable and pay cable?  They owe a debt of gratitude to this show, The Shield.  Without it, they would never have been able to take the ball and run with it if this show didn't lay out the blueprints first.  With a top notch story, some of the best acting I've ever witnessed, and documentary like filming style, this show is definitely one to etch into the history books.  Created by Shawn Ryan, this show is a spectacle, just short of a miracle.<br /><br />Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) is the leader of the Strike Team in fabled LA neighborhood, Farmington.  He leads a Strike Team that includes Shane Vendrell (Walton Goggins, in what I would call the best performance in TV or film that I have every seen), Curtis \\"Lem\\" Lemansky (Kenneth Johnson), and Ronnie Gardocki (David Rees Snell), who often do not play by the rules, and break the law to preserve the law, throughout the show's 7 seasons.  They are opposed by the precinct's other cops, including Captain (and later, City Councilman) David Aceveda (Benito Martinez).  The show also includes sidestories featuring others, such as police officers Dani (Catherine Dent) and Julien (Michael Jace), and the detective duo, Dutch (Jay Karnes) and Claudette (CCH Pounder, another performance that never got any award season love).  Others came and went, such as guest season stars in Glenn Close (who did win herself an award for this), Forrest Whitaker, and Anthony Anderson (taking a turn from the comedy to play an excellent villain to the Strike Team).<br /><br />The show has ups and downs for each of the characters, but none is stronger than the central one, Vic.  Chiklis gives a lights out performance during the show's run, and got himself plenty of awards to back that up.  His struggle, in keeping a straight face in committing murder, robbing money, beating suspects, and stealing drugs, balanced with taking care of his estranged family, is one you feel with him until the show takes a sharp right turn andmakes you understand just how big a monster this man truly is.  Only after a heinous act by his teammate, Shane, and continued acts of continued violence and loose behavior, do you as the viewer realize what you just witnessed.<br /><br />Trust me on this, you will not be disappointed by anything you witness with this television show.  It laid the groundwork for shows that followed on FX, AMC, HBO, and Showtime, and even network television.  Do yourself a favor and get this.  Now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is amazing. The det as old in the background are most detailed. The gigantic monkey is awesome. C.f. o not hesitate to buy!:):):):):):):):).

B00ABXA1HI|1.0|As soon as you install the free version, you need to buy a subscription if you want to use it outside your home network. Go figure?
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this movie.  I was intrigued but I was a little skeptical of the cast.  I ended up liking it a lot.  Give it a shot.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Thanks so much for the great movie. It works wonderfully and I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This one pulls out all the stops!  It adapts and improves the Frank Miller graphic novel!  There are added elements to this film to add texture to the characters I've never seen before.  Peter Weller does a fantastic job as an older Dark Knight.  I can't get over how close they were to the actual graphic novel.  If you saw part I, part II is even better.  I am surprised it wasn't just one 2 and a half hour hour film release.  I would have been willing to see this at the movies.  It was that good.  I have to give this one five stars.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|She likes Michael Buble and really enjoyed the cd/dvd combination. So nice to have the options of buying and having it sent to their address.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|At first I was not expecting much. But when the movie started, I had a big smile on my face. The detail on the scene is amazing, you can even read street signs. The sound quality is excellent, true surround. I started watching this move when I was 5 years old and completely destroyed the VHS print after 80+ viewings. Now I don't have to worry about that :-) I would highly recommend this to anyone!!! and you can't beat the price at amazon, simply amazing!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Never played a game like this before but i am hooked like thousands of others. It does crash frequently but i do not care I still love it
B0088WK27S|4.0|It is definitely not your usual story of redemption.  There's a lot of things to think about after watching this movie.  If you rent it, definitely watch the ending credits to see the actual man it was based on.
B004BSAEQC|5.0|Thanks so much for the great CD. It works wonderfully and I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you.
B009IF7092|5.0|When this show started out I thought it would not last beyond a season.  Four super-smart \\"geeky\\" guys who love to go to the comics store and love to quote Star Trek and debate philosophical issue regarding superheroes trying to connect with the unreachable hot blonde next door.  Well the writers of this  series keep coming up with new and hilarious new avenues for this show that never seems to get boring.<br /><br />What is always constant among these characters is both their hatred towards Sheldon, the self-centered egotist who slings insults without a second thought and whose mind that can solve string theory, cannot fathom the most mundane things regarding human interaction.  As each of the characters has an innate desire to slay this \\"major annoyance,\\" they are also inexplicably drawn to him, no matter what \\"detailled contracts\\" he makes them sign or iron clad rules he makes them follow (each day is assigned a specified meal and activity).<br /><br />The stories keep evolving for the better, whether it be learning that alcohol can allow Raj to talk to girls, having a Wil Wheaton/ Sheldon Cooper rivalry, finding the perfect woman for Sheldon via an on-line dating service (Amy), having Sheldon and Penny sing \\"Soft Kitty,\\" having Raj's parents appearring only via Skyppe or whether it's knock \\"Penny,\\" knock, \\"Penny,\\" knock, \\"Penny!\\"<br /><br />And now the show is into its sixth season and nobody cares that the elevator is still out of order!  Some of the best scenes happen when they are walking up or down those several flights (how did they move that Time Machine up the stairs?).<br /><br />TBS seems to have a few nights of marathan episodes each week and I can watch them back to back without getting bored.  While a show like Modern Family is funny, the shows seem to all be the same and the characters have not really evolved since the first episode.  With TBBT we see Amy evolving to becoming more human and little by little we see Sheldon start to change (he did getjealous of Amy's date with Stuart).  Penny has learned to accept Sheldon's quirks and occasionally Raj will slip and talk in front of a girl sans alcohol.  I don't think we will ever see Howard's mother on-screen though but we do know that the two people that tame Sheldon are his mother and his twin sister.<br /><br />I hope the writers can keep up the excellent job on this show for seasons to come and that the actors realize what they have now and don't decide to jump ship just yet.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This temple run is wayyyyyyyy better than the first. I play this one almost non stop. The graphics are cool and i love all the new obstacles. This one even has missions and power ups. Thats my kind of game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|quick games., easily played while waiting for doctor appointments and such. fun and entertaining! Some games are easier than others and it was fun just skipping around to various ones.

B009UZLRJE|5.0|When this show started out I thought it would not last beyond a season. Four super-smart \\"geeky\\" guys who love to go to the comics store and love to quote Star Trek and debate philosophical issue regarding superheroes trying to connect with the unreachable hot blonde next door. Well the writers of this series keep coming up with new and hilarious new avenues for this show that never seems to get boring.<br /><br />What is always constant among these characters is both their hatred towards Sheldon, the self-centered egotist who slings insults without a second thought and whose mind that can solve string theory, cannot fathom the most mundane things regarding human interaction. As each of the characters has an innate desire to slay this \\"major annoyance,\\" they are also inexplicably drawn to him, no matter what \\"detailled contracts\\" he makes them sign or iron clad rules he makes them follow (each day is assigned a specified meal and activity).<br /><br />The stories keep evolving for the better, whether it be learning that alcohol can allow Raj to talk to girls, having a Wil Wheaton/ Sheldon Cooper rivalry, finding the perfect woman for Sheldon via an on-line dating service (Amy), having Sheldon and Penny sing \\"Soft Kitty,\\" having Raj's parents appearring only via Skyppe or whether it's knock \\"Penny,\\" knock, \\"Penny,\\" knock, \\"Penny!\\"<br /><br />And now the show is into its sixth season and nobody cares that the elevator is still out of order! Some of the best scenes happen when they are walking up or down those several flights (how did they move that Time Machine up the stairs?).<br /><br />TBS seems to have a few nights of marathan episodes each week and I can watch them back to back without getting bored. While a show like Modern Family is funny, the shows seem to all be the same and the characters have not really evolved since the first episode. With TBBT we see Amy evolving to becoming more human and little by little we see Sheldon start to change (he did get jealous of Amy's date with Stuart). Penny has learned to accept Sheldon's quirks and occasionally Raj will slip and talk in front of a girl sans alcohol. I don't think we will ever see Howard's mother on-screen though but we do know that the two people that tame Sheldon are his mother and his twin sister.<br /><br />I hope the writers can keep up the excellent job on this show for seasons to come and that the actors realize what they have now and don't decide to jump ship just yet.

B005DKLPF6|4.0|After a good decade of slogging through the scene as one of the toughest hard rock/heavy metal outfits around, Atlanta's own Mastodon seemed to have pretty much pushed themselves to the limits with 2009's dense and experimental \\"Crack The Skye.\\" Perhaps it's only fitting then that the follow-up effort is less spacey and quite a bit crunchier than its predecessor. To that end, \\"The Hunter\\" finds the band coming back down to Earth a bit and focusing more on songs that pack an immediate punch than an album full of epic slow-burners. For better or worse, Mastodon's fifth album is in turns the group's most stripped-down and rawest affair since their debut.<br /><br />Like its artwork, \\"The Hunter\\" is simple yet compelling. Whether the gang are channeling the Steve Miller Band via \\"Creature Lives\\" or spitting out insanely catchy yet nonsensical verses on radio-hit \\"Curl of the Burl,\\" there is nary a dull moment to be found on this album. Without straying too far from a proven formula, Mastodon keep things pretty basic yet ultimately compelling. Though quirky song-titles such as \\"Bedazzled Fingernails\\" and \\"The Octopus Has No Friends\\" would suggest otherwise, \\"The Hunter\\" is a pretty down-and-dirty, straight-forward affair. From the intense opening of \\"Black Tongue\\" to the mournful and introspective \\"The Sparrow,\\" the album hits all the right marks. In its near 60 minute running time it manages being almost as easy to digest as a thirty minute Ramones album and yet packs the appropriate wallop one would expect from a modern metal outfit.<br /><br />If there's one serious detriment to \\"The Hunter,\\" it's that the production job by Mike Elizondo flattens the usually bold and brash nature of Mastodon's music. At times, the sound is distorted to the point where the dynamics are nearly lost. While not quite as bad a production/mix job as Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic,\\" it's both troubling and ironic that music this large and in charge is neutered by an overly loud and compressed presentation. One can't help but wonder how much more powerful the album would be with the mix dialed down a notch.<br /><br />For the most part, Mastodon held up their end of the deal and served up a hearty slab of hard rock and heavy metal. In spite of the spotty production, the songs rock through and through. While their progressive tendencies have been tempered a bit, you can rest assured that \\"The Hunter\\" is simply a detour in what is sure to be a long and fruitful journey. Maybe not the most essential in the band's discography, \\"The Hunter\\" at the very least proves that even at their most basic, Mastodon can still rip the faces off most modern rock bands these days.resentation.

B007K8ILUQ|2.0|Director Stanley Kubrick's first film was made available for purchase late 2012.  Finally Kubrick fans, like me, were able to view the debut of a cinematic legend.  There are some items worthy of praise here namely the cinematography and the inventive editing.  The story itself follows a group of soldiers trapped behind enemy lines trying to march back undetected to friendly territory.  Unfortunately, the lack of character depth sinks the movie.  All the characters feel like thin cut-outs rather than living breathing men.  It doesn't help that the audio overdubs are poorly done and just scream low-budget production.  Be warned this war drama doesn't offer much for anyone outside of Kubrick devotees.  All in all, \\"Fear And Desire\\" shows promise from a visual standpoint, but is lacking in every other department.<br /><br />  For blu-ray fans, this release is pretty much bare-bones with the exception of an early Kubrick documentary short called \\"The Seafarers\\" (1953).  The audio and video are of good quality on this disc from KINO Classics.  That said, this blu-ray is really for the most devoted Kubrick fans.

B007FIY3VW|3.0|This is my favorite writing/office app.  It works fine for microsoft word or excel.  However, it does not work with powerpoint after the latest update.  But that is not why I only give it three stars.  It is because it does not support google docs files.  Even is not like it is not supposed to, it says it does right in the main menue and supposedly lets you access your google account.  After it lets you get on to it shows the titles of your docs, but nothing else.  Once you tap on a file it says, &quot;File not compatible.&quot;  I will not use an app that does that because all of my important docs are on google.  It also crashes not infrequently.  However, what should someone exspect if it is only a dollar.  That being said, I plan on getting a more exspensive, trustworthy office app.

B00B2166BS|5.0|This is a new revision: 02/13/2013<br /><br />First, the wiring of the Pogo is symetrical. This means you do no damage if you accidentally reverse and force the connector on. It is mechanically able to be installed one way, but experience tells me someone out there will try to force it on upside down.<br /><br />Secondly, i really measured the supply current at the 0% charge level with the USB port plug as .288A,<br />with the Pogo, it was several times higher at 1.670 A. recently added this info. At the very minimum, according to USB standards, the output current can go to 1.5A or even a bit higher, according to Wikipedia. My own measurements prove this.<br /><br />The voltages are either direction as follows:<br /><br />1-Gnd straight to usb<br /><br />2-1.21 VDC +Data<br /><br />3-5.25<br /><br />The +5 volt lines are shorted together at the POGO side, ultimately coming from an internal 8-pin IC regulator labeled P3X (No other markings) for surge and voltage regulation. It appears that we could make one of these for a dock, but at $19.99, why bother? These are, considering the engineering that went into this, an outstanding bargain, and item to own if you love your Nexus 10.<br /><br />4-5.25<br /><br />5-1.21 VDC -Data<br /><br />6-Gnd<br /><br />The data lines when shorted together as they appear to be here, simply put the charger into the dedicated \\"charge\\" only mode, allowing more current to be output.<br /><br />So far in my own testing, only the original Samsung charger has the 2 data leads at 1.2 VDC.<br /><br />Personally, I have ordered an extra wall charger and an auto charger from Samsung, who if you register your device will give you a 50% off coupon to use towards those purchases.<br /><br />Get this now if you own the Nexus 10!

1451678193|5.0|Ever since I was required to read the Orwellian speculative-fiction novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" in high school, I have loved Ray Bradbury's writing.  While it may be up for debate as to whether he's one of the best science fiction writers of all time, I certainly rank him as one of my favorites.  His lyrical way with words, insight into human nature and its vices and weaknesses, and frightening but all-too-plausible view of the future made him one of the most powerful writers in the genre, and his passing marked a great loss to the science fiction community.<br /><br />Despite loving the aformentioned \\"Fahrenheit\\" and many of his short stories, however, until recently I had yet to read Bradbury's other popular classic, \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\"  I had already heard from other sources that the \\"science\\" and predictions in this book were somewhat outdated, but I figured I could forgive this.  So I picked up the book... and was blown away.  This book is just as good, if not better, than \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\"<br /><br />Unlike \\"Fahrenheit,\\" \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is a collection of short stories instead of a single narrative, although all the stories end up tying together to form a cohesive story arc.  We see the first explorers arrive on the Red Planet, and the fates many of them meet at the hands of the native Martians.  As conditions on Earth deteriorate, more and more humans begin to colonize Mars, and while some of the natives resist while others try to co-exist with the invaders, eventually they die out as humanity encroaches on their territory.  Man conquers Mars... but at a terrible price, and as Earth is wracked by war and destruction the Red Planet may be humanity's last hope for survival.<br /><br />Bradbury has a remarkable gift with words, his prose lyrical and almost poetic, much like Peter S. Beagle of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" fame.  His descriptions are apt and beautiful, making one feel as if they're right there witnessing events in person.  Some readers might find his description of Mars somewhat jarring, as Mars had not yet been explored when he wrote his \\"Chronicles,\\" but if one can accept this or think of this as an alternate version of Mars, then they'll find that this inconsistency doesn't detract from the book.<br /><br />Some of the stories in this book are whimsical and fun, such as \\"The Green Morning\\" and \\"Night Meeting.\\"  Most of the others, however, have a tragic air to them -- humanity seems to have not learned from its mistakes in the past, and the manner in which Mars is colonized and its natives wiped out bears more than a passing resemblance to how the Native Americans were treated during the colonization of the US.  And more than one story veers right into horror in the end -- \\"The Third Expedition\\" and \\"The Off Season\\" have particularly chilling endings.<br /><br />By far my favorite story in this anthology is \\"There Will Come Soft Rains.\\"  This story is unique in that it doesn't take place on Mars at all, but on a war-torn Earth... and it has no characters, but rather focuses on an abandoned, automated house.  It still manages to be a powerful statement on how mankind has remade his world to be an artificial paradise... and how even in our absence the world goes on, as much as we would like to think it won't.<br /><br />\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is a powerful book that remains meaningful even today, and I would even go so far as to say it's required reading if you're a fan of classic science fiction.  While the technology and Martian landscape might feel dated today, the messages it conveys are timeless and necessary.  And the writing is beautiful, far more so than one would expect from a science fiction novel.  Strongly recommended.his description of Mars somewhat jarring, as Mars had not yet been explored when he wrote his \\"Chronicles,\\" but if one can accept this or think of this as an alternate version of Mars, then they'll find that this inconsistency doesn't detract from the book.<br /><br />Some of the stories in this book are whimsical and fun, such as \\"The Green Morning\\" and \\"Night Meeting.\\"  Most of the others, however, have a tragic air to them -- humanity seems to have not learned from its mistakes in the past, and the manner in which Mars is colonized and its natives wiped out bears more than a passing resemblance to how the Native Americans were treated during the colonization of the US.

0307341550|3.0|Sharp Objects was the second book by Ms. Flyyn that I have had the pleasure of immersing myself in. After reading Gone Girl, I think it's safe to say that my expectations were VERY high. I wasn't as impressed by this book, but that has nothing to do with the fact that the writing itself was still on point, and the storyline, nothing short of creative.<br /><br />The story opened in one of my much loved cities, Chicago, but quickly found itself unraveling in the small town of Wind Gap, Missouri. I'm still not sure if it was intentional, but I had a hard time grasping onto an idea of the towns inhabitants and lifestyle. On the one hand, the residents were wealthy, but then they were just as easily working as housemaids in their friends homes-the picture just wasn't painted too clearly, I was quite lost in that sense.<br /><br />Camille, our highly disturbed protagonist, was quite the character. I couldn't decide if I appreciated her for her struggles, or if I resented her for her stupidity. She was kind-hearted, and honest, and quick witted, but she was also self-conscious, and vulnerable, and nonchalant. I feel like all of those things didn't quite work together to pain the clearest picture of her either. I also had a hard time picturing her as a female character, especially one that was supposed to stunningly beautiful. She almost just \\"threw\\" herself through the storyline, almost as though she was in a huge pinball machine-she would hit certain climaxes, and then just as easily fall through some holes. With that said though, I felt for her, especially towards the end, and decided that she was a character I enjoyed reading about and hearing from.<br /><br />Secondary characters were appalling in this novel-in the greatest sense of the word. I both despised and welcomed the brassiness of Amma, a 13-yr old princess of the rotten sort. Their mother was also another amazing role-it was almost impossible not to hate her, but a (disturbed) part of me always wanted to hear her opinion, predict her movements. There were characters of the small town sort as well, who all played there part a bit clich&eacute;d sometimes-I didn't really care much for them, and kind of got them mixed up at times.<br /><br />The storyline itself was another thing. Another fantastic thing. I alternated from the comfort of my bed, to the slight discomfort of my couch, to the very.edge.of.my.kitchen.chair. There was nail biting and burning questions and \\"AHA! I know who done it!\\" thoughts. But such is not the way of Gillian Flynn. She kept me guessing until the end, the VERY end, until literally a few pages from the end..end. As with Gone Girl, I absolutely LOVED her thought process. I admired and appreciated the time in which she took to map out a series of events that thrilled me, disturbed me, confused me and CAPTURED me..ALL AT ONCE. An absolute master of her craft, this novel was something completely out of the ordinary, yet it could be something happening in your very backyard, should it choose to.<br /><br />Fans of psychological thrillers would definitely appreciate this novel, and already fans of Gillian Flynn will applause another job well done.her opinion, predict her movements.

B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Yeah, I know there are 11 months left. But sometimes an album is everything you want your music to be. \\"Finally Home\\" is just that! I've been a huge fan of Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr for a long time from their Nashville stuff. And I've seen Kenny Loggins at least 5 times in concert over the years. To have their talents combined into one group is an awesome premise to begin with. They take that premise and make it work...magically. Immaculately crafted (mostly inspiring and uplifting) pop with a California Country edge, driven by their truly otherworldly harmony blend. What The Mamas and Papas were to the 60s? What Fleetwood Mac was to the 70s and 80s?  It's not a stretch to put BSR in that category for today's scene. If you like country groups like Little Big Town or Lady Antebellum, you'll love BSR as well. Favorite tracks? SO many! \\"Little Victories\\", \\"Dream\\", \\"Feeling Brave\\", \\"Just Say Yes\\"... But this album is chock full of beauties from tracks 1 to 15. My ears are..well..finally home!

B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is typically great...if you. an get it to open I think its beginning to be more hassle than its worth.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great follow up to the previous two books.  A fitting ending to how it all began and a surprise ending.
0385535147|5.0|If you're a Grisham fan, you'll love this one.  Lots of twists and turns and a surprise ending.  I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and a fast moving book.
B005JR4K28|4.0|My husband and i love this show. A cute, funny and lighthearted comedy. Very enjoyable and a nice way to wind down after work.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|I like the idea, but it is still an ongoing project after only two weeks. I have only lost 1kg.
0525478817|5.0|This novel is so heart-felt, soulful and delightful all at once.  The author captured very well the way crises in life can distill for us what is truly important.  The young characters in this book live lives with the sort of integrity we all can only hope to achieve in a long lifetime.  Bravo!
B0091Q82L8|5.0|what can i say if you love live who, this one kicks BOTTOM wharts and all !!!<br />go for it you WHO-LIGANS !!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|A good suspenseful work with lots of twists and turns!! How someone can dream all of this stuff up is amazing.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|not as user friendly as on the computer.  navigation is limited and it will take some getting used to.  I have not played around with it much and find myself waiting to get on my home computer rather than this app on my kindle.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It would not appear on my kindle at first but then it did &amp; I had a great time playing it!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland 1 is a carefully constructed view of 21st century geopolitics. This story is developed through characters and events which reveal the complicated politics of East and West, past and present. Family life and individual political aspirations are clearly presented through the strong acting of the principal characters.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I have ever read!  I would encourage everyone to read it. I laughed, I cried, and felt as though I was right there with them.  Wish I could have known Morrie!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very interesting and driving plot, rounded and interesting characters, and great set up for the next book. Very well done.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Small but powerful.  I am hearing impaired and can't hear my smartphone without my hearing aids.. I use the Fiio when I go to the gym and I need to remove my hearing aids. It works great. Holds a charge pretty long. Don't let the small size fool you. This is a great amp for the money. I highly recommend..
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The other diary of a wimpy kid books were hilarious. This one was mediocre it had only angels funny moments. I think Jeff Kinney is running out if ideas
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was written in a way you had know idea of what to expect. It was a very good book once I started read it I couldn't but it down until I finished the entire book. Great read!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I work out all the time but get bored very fast, I do The Firm series, PX90 series, Spin bike, Treadmill/run, weights, etc...so I thought this was going to be a peice of cake (no pun intended). I'VE BEEN ON LEVEL 2 FOR A MONTH NOW AND I STILL FEEL LIKE I AM GOING TO DIE AT THE END OF THE 20 MINS! I LOVE IT! Go Jillian! Ordering the Body Revolution is an absolute must. Why pay the gym when you can purchase these.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love the fact I don't have to bounce from city to city and that is easy to use and fun to maintain. I love games like this and can't wait to get back playing
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These were one of the best books I ever read! I did not know what they were instill my friend told me and I'm glad she did other wise I would not have a great visual of the prim rose growing deep in the ground, or the them finding katniss root by the trees as they went swimming. Suzanne Collins, one of the best authors ever!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story is so well written that you feel you know the characters but anxiously await their next move. A must read!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I'd like to see if anyone can dominate Monkey Lane on Hard with only Monkey Apprentices. Also, there should be an archer monkey. Tier 1: Pops more and pops faster. Tier 2: Pops camo and have even more range. Tier 3: Shoots with a crossbow, which shoots 2x as fast and have a big flaming arrow. Tier 4: Has a whole castle of archers and Ability: Shoots a hail of arrows everywhere for 20 seconds.
B003L16FAE|3.0|I love the movie but I didn't see any improvement in resolution over DVD I was disappointed in that aspect to say the least.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|To any person who has ever suffered any kind of sexual trama I would warn you to seriously consider not reading this story unless you have dealt with it and are in a good place.<br /><br />The story itself is a wonderful romance.  I would have given it 5 stars had the warning about abuse be a little more clear that it was sexual trama.  Very well written book.  Worth a read if you can get beyond the heartache of it all.
1451695195|3.0|I didn't care too much for the book because most of it was medical terms.  i never went to medical school so I didn't understand too much of what he was saying.  I want to read more about heaven and his experiences in heaven and with Jesus.  Because it's all about Jesus and his return for his people his church. Wanted to read about what Jesus told him.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I absolutely love the challenge the game provides my brain but yet it is relaxing!! I have played other games like this but this one is by far the best!!
B006TKP2B2|4.0|As much as I really did want to like this book and fought to read it through, I only got 3/4 through. The Windup Girl is good from a certain point of view - the plot seems interesting so far, and fairly complex. The political structure is well thought out, and the intrigue seems pretty cool. For those plusses, I think others would like the book. Also, the religious structure is interesting, if you're into that. There's also a hint of science in the science fiction, but I kept wondering why more alternative power sources weren't employed other than animal/people power. Why so many springs and ballast systems? Seems silly. I admit, our oil-based power cannot last forever, but we've still got geothermal, hydroelectric, and other ideas, including solar, which is dependent mostly on sand and printing technology. Puzzling and only loosely explained by the lack of many types of plants we find common today.<br /><br />I can also see why this book would win an award. It is unusual; it has an unusual setting and unusual cultures unfamiliar to many types of western readers. There was either a lot of research or life experience in the book. That was cool.<br /><br />It took me a while, but I finally pinned down what I found jarring reading this book. The Thai culture is described as both extremely religious, royalist, and extremely subtle. More subtle than the Chinese, even (who in the real world are so 'subtle' that they only last month acknowledged they have a smog problem in Beijing due to the volume of hospitalizations). The Thais in the Windup world are described as indirect about nearly everything, willing to accept bribes and favors, unwilling to stand fast on commitments, happy bowing to two or more masters, etc. The book itself is so opposite of this that it ticked me off.<br /><br />I felt that every symbolic act or item was explained in full, not left for the me to figure out. The same points made about culture or religion in one chapter are reflected on again in the next, and the next. I felt like the bribes particularly were explained far too many times. I also know it's not common, wise, or helpful for the White Shirts to raid the landing pads, because every character seemed to say it.<br /><br />[MILD SPOILER ALERT]<br />I didn't really enjoy any of the characters. They all seemed to lack hope and drive, and those who had hope seemed rather foolhardy.  One character gets caught and killed trying to enact some sort of ill-planned revenge. Just another foolish martyr. It's one thing to be aggressive, it's another to be aggressive without a plan. Most of the other characters were either career criminals, slimy politicians, or too-mysterious opportunists trying to manipulate each other. I never really got attached.<br />[END SPOILER]<br /><br />If you plan to buy - read the sample first. The sample is indicative of the form and pacing of the rest of the book. Also note that the title character makes rare appearances and is only one part of an ensemble cast.next, and the next. I felt like the bribes particularly were explained far too many times.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|The story is about a brutal game being played in a place where current social structure exists. Though many twists and turns are provided throughout the novel, somehow the events get predictable. It is interesting to read, but not exciting.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|I was introduced to Keane back when they released Hopes and Fears, and really loved their music, but was sad to see it go downhill with some of the later albums.  I was very pleased, then, to find that Strangeland was not so much a return to the same musical style exactly, but a return to the musical quality of Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|A complete waste of time and money. The plot was mundane and so was the acting. Don't waste your time
B005AKFXZW|5.0|One Million Stars.    THE CIRCUS ARRIVES without warning.............  It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.    These sentences are  the most memorable start to a book I have ever read. Intriguing & dreamlike which makes way for an equally intriguing & dream like novel.    \\"You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows that they might do because of it, because of your words. That is your role, your gift.\\"    I simply adored this book beyond words, I've been struggling to create a review which I feel is worthy of such a near perfect book ( & I'm far from perfect) so I decided to just write what I felt while reading, why i think you should read it & stick in a whole lot of quotes because I practically highlighted every paragraph Marco & Celia where together in.    \\"I would have written you, myself, if I could put down in words everything I want to say to you. A sea of ink would not be enough.\\" \\"But you built me dreams instead.\\"    To say I loved the book from the start would be a lie. I was engaged from the start but a little between the middle & the start my attention started to wander (not really wandering i did finish it in less then two days but I did put it down! So to me that counts as wandering) I was expecting the relationship of Celia & Marco to just happen, & to have the circus & the other characters just work around it. which is my own fault (I've read too many paranormal romances lately where the characters just jump each other a few chapters  or just paragraphs in!) instead you get to watch as this relationship between to arch rivals pitted against each in a game of pure magic & strength unravel then flourish into a beautiful one in a lifetime romance.    \\"Do you remember all of your audiences?\\" Marco asks.  \\"Not all of them,\\" Celia says. \\"But I remember the people who look at me the way you do.\\"  \\"What way might that be?\\"  \\"As thoughthey cannot decide if they are afraid of me or they want to kiss me.\\"  \\" I am not afraid of you,\\" Marco says.\\"    Not only was I blown away by the chracters & the story but by the circus it self which seems to take on its own chracter & identity. The way it's described is unbelievable & so far from reality, i became overwhelmed but just couldn't get enough!    \\"The sign outside this tent is accompanied by a small box full of smooth black stones. The text instructs you to take one with you as you enter. Inside, the tent is dark, the ceiling covered with open black umbrellas, the curving handles hanging down like icicles. In the center of the room there is a pool. A pond enclosed within a black stone wall that is surrounded by white gravel. The air carries the salty tinge of the ocean. You walk over to the edge to look inside. The gravel crunches beneath your feet. It is shallow, but it is glowing. A shimmering, shifting light cascades up through the surface of the water. A soft radiance, enough to illuminate the pool and the stones that sit at the bottom. Hundreds of stones, each identical to the one you hold in your hand. The light beneath filters through the spaces between the stones. Reflections ripple around the room, making it appear as though the entire tent is underwater. You sit on the wall, turning your black stone over and over in your fingers. The stillness of the tent becomes a quiet melancholy. Memories begin to creep forward from hidden corners of your mind. Passing disappointments. Lost chances and lost causes. Heartbreaks and pain and desolate, horrible loneliness. Sorrows you thought long forgotten mingle with still-fresh wounds. The stone feels heavier in your hand. When you drop it in the pool to join the rest of the stones, you feel lighter. As though you have released something more than a smooth polished piece of rock.\\"    Why you should you read this?.....well to put it simply you just have to! Yep that's my whole reasoning, you just have to, its one of those timeless & classic love stories you just have to read (at least five times) to really appreciate.    *spoiler* \\"He goes directly to the ballroom, making his way to the center of the dance floor. He takes Celia's arm, spinning her away from Herr Thiessen.  Marco pulls her to him in an emerald embrace, so close that no one distinction remains between where his suite ends and her gown begins. To Celia there is suddenly no one else in the room as he holds her in his arms. But before she can vocalize her surprise, his lips close over hers and she is lost in wordless bliss.  Marco kissed her as though they are the only two people in the world. The air swirls in a tempest around them, blowing open the glass doors to the garden with a tangle of billowing curtains. Every eye in the ballroom turns in their direction. And then he released her and walks away. By the time Marco leaves the room, almost everyone has forgotten the incident entirely. It is replaced by a momentary confusion that is blamed on the head or the excessive amounts of champagne. Herr Thiessen cannot recall why Celia has suddenly stopped dancing, or when her gown has shifted to its current deep green. \\"Is something wrong?\\" he asks, when he realizes that she is trembling.\\" *spolier end*    I often make my own little playlist or choose theme songs for my favorite books but this time I'm pretty happy with it & found out I'm not the only one who does it, so if your interested here a couple of the song & the playlist:    Florance + the Machine. Cosmic Love (Acoustic):  [...]    Emilie Autumn. Cold:  [...]    Bloc Party. Signs:  [...]    Iron & Wine. The Trapeze Swinger:  [...]    The Night Circus Musical Playlist:  [...]    \\"You think, as you walk away from Le Cirque des Rêves and into the creeping dawn, that you felt more awake within the confines of the circus.  You are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is the dream.\\"    1 like flag

B0025KVLU6|4.0|I bought this for a gift and the person liked it.<br />Good conditions and worth it. It came out with some background information about the singers.<br />Good item.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|why does this app need to know my contacts and what I'm doing on the Internet I suggest playing with wi-fi off.
1568814518|5.0|A excepcional book for that ones who want to start the art of folding. Át least essential in a folder livery.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|If I knew how to change my horses name I would give it 5 stars. So umm yah. Play it
B000VMBXNA|4.0|This delightful story chronicals the Queen of England discovering the joys of reading for pleasure and knowledge. It is charming in its detail and a great reminder for readers of why reading can be both stimulating and educatonal.
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|I'm not entirely certain if it is some hardware glitch on my end or something broke in the code with an update.  However, I used to use this program side loaded from the internet to stream my collection of videos to my Kindle fire.  It used to work beautifully, until two days ago.  Now every time I attempt to stream a video I get an error message.  It will still play local files, it just won't talk nice to my media server anymore.  If not for that it would be five stars.
143911000X|5.0|My son loves this book!  He was delivered promptly.  If you have a hard time getting your child to read, just purchase this book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best Temple run yet amazing game for all and great obstacles.And what a huge monkey you're running from this time.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett is an excellent writer and I have been reading his books for years.The book has an excellent plot and holds your interest.I look forward to reading the secules.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This author is absolutely amazing! You really need to read all of his books...there is SO much more detail. I just wish he would write his last two books more quickly. I can't wait!
B0071BGOJC|1.0|I must have known what I was going to experience as I bought this book after reading the negative comments about it and I must say I have not been disappointed. They have been desperately accurate. the book only follows the history of the period with some personal stories thrown in. It gives the impression of an unfinished book, such as only the research work has been published without the personal touch of the author to give an actual life to the characters.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great graphics on this game. Some of the puzzles were challenging but over all not frustrating or too hard.I love hidden object adventure games and I will definitely be playing this one again. only disappointed that I beat it already.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because it is just like 1st one the but better. There's better graphics and there's a giant thing running after the people. Buy it you'll LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!(:
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The book had some good twists, but the characters were a little young for the story.  An easy read and worth the money and time.
B008XDSUNU|5.0|I came across the full album on YouTube and decided to take a listen. I loved it from the very beginning. Feels like 80s-90s nostalgia in my favorite movie dream. Sounds crazy, but it's true. Perfect summery, chill out music anyone can enjoy.
0345803507|1.0|This story could have been told in one book. The plot is so slim and pathetic. I skipped sections in the first book because I just couldn't take any more. I was really hoping for a STORY.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|As for most of Clancy's books, I really enjoyed this new episode of Jack Ryan's adventures. Some of the concepts and threats exposed in the book are really interesting and worth considering. The intrigue and the characters may not be as detailed and researched as in some of the best books but the book kept me hooked until I finished it.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Once it is unlocked plays virtually everything! I would recommend it over any other media player out there on the market.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great game so far. Awesome graphics &amp; dialogue. After only 15 min. of play I know that I will definitely finish the game.
B0082Z1CVQ|2.0|I think this book is a touching story of a mother and her kids trying to live happy romance and more. Mother got what she wanted a grand child and even though they never became rich they were rich in love affection and happiness.
B001J9EHSC|5.0|I remember buying this when I was a teenager. Of course, I didn't understand the depth of her lyrics, but they have grown with me. I listen to the album now and realize what a lyrical genius Fiona is. Her songs are heavy, dark and beautiful. This is still my favorite of all her albums. \\"Shadowboxer\\" was the first song I heard before I bought it. \\"Pale September\\" is now one of my more desired tracks. \\"Criminal\\" is a classic and \\"Never is a Promise\\" is full of sadness and soul. I love Fiona. I think you love her or hate her. Personally, if you can't grasp her lyrics and appreciate her talent, you should probably just download some crap. Like Nicki Minaj.
0345803485|2.0|Really, I don't understand all the hype surrounding this book. If the main &#34;guy&#34; character wasn't rich off his rear end he would be behind bars. I bought the entire trilogy and was extremely sorry once I read the first book.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I love this movie and I couldn't find this in redbox,Hastings but you guys have this wonderful movie for me,thank youuuuu
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|The book is ok, but follows teh same plot as most of his other pieces of work.  You also need to be sure that you've read the others so you understand the story line.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|fun game, but on kindle fire most of my friends don't show up and when I try to visit the couple friends I have it kicks me off the game. annoying!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is awesome, it has amazing graphics that everyone enjoys.  Me and my family are obsessed and keep up the good work. I'm going to try to beet my high score now!
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Works pretty well. By itself, the magnetic force between the &#34;L-tip&#34; plug and this converter is not extremely strong, so I helped it with a short piece of tape wrapped around the plug, grabbing the top & bottom of this converter.  The magnetic holding force between the converter and the laptop is pretty strong. Overall, with the little tweak of tape job, it works absolutely great. (If you don't have a firm & straight contact, the electricity won't flow and the laptop won't charge.)
0345803493|2.0|This book goes on and on and doesn't really have much to say. The author clearly has issues that need addressed.
B00B0NDF26|4.0|There's no doubt about it, this album is a departure from Tegan Quin and Sara Quin's catalog of albums. But this is not a bad thing; I believe every artist should embrace change instead of repeating history. Being a longtime fan of the duo, I have to admit I was taken a back upon first listen. I really didn't know what to think of it or if I liked it or not. After a couple more listens it hit me for what the album is and I started to get it.<br /><br /> \\"Heartthrob\\" is very catchy and in my opinion the most upbeat album of their career. There still are lyrics of relationship woes and personal demons, but the music that follows can't help but bring a smile to the atmosphere that is this album. What I really like about this album is that although it is a pop album it has a soul. It's not plastic and nauseating as most of the pop garbage that plagues the airwaves. The production on this album is excellent and fits the tones of Tegan and Sara's singing range nicely.<br /><br /> What is predictable and unfortunate is that the fans that prefer the \\"indie,\\" folky,\\" genre that the girls do so well will be upset or even dismiss this album as the \\"sellout\\" record. I will admit that I am saddened that there are only a couple songs that actually have guitar on it (an added track if you purchased the iTunes preorder). Ever since Tegan and Sara collaborated with Tiesto on the song \\"Feel it in my Bones,\\" I felt that this direction of pop/electric was inevitable. Love it or hate it the song worked and was quite enjoyable.<br /><br /> This album deserves a chance and an open mind. It's a new chapter in Tegan and Sara's impressive career and like all of their albums it has a special place in my heart. I really hope a tour is in the works this year; I'm curious how this album will translate on stage. I recently read an interview the girls did with Rolling Stone magazine, they addressed that even though this album may turn off or lose some of their fan base they are hoping that hardcore and new fans alike will enjoy it and carry on with them. They also gave the impression that they can't please everyone and don't plan to, I couldn't agree more with their attitude. Hope you enjoy!

B005G4TJUC|2.0|Cheesy, rushed and too much Shia. Bay's twist on this is not liked by me and much better could have been done. But what do I know? The animated movie was excellent compared to this crap and even the games War for Cybertron and the Fall of Cybertron make this movie look bad. Action parts were ok.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|I borrowed this from the library and went to read it on my basic kindle and it wasn't there. Long story short, it isn't compatible with the basic kindle, only the cloud reader, kindle fire, ipad and android. So I read it in the cloud reader. It's very short, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered. It's very cute, I especially enjoyed the poem about the fat cat, since I have one.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|About seven years ago  (in my late teens) I chanced across this beautiful  beautiful love story of a handsome wizard and an insecure girl.  Needless to say this movie enchanted me and capture my heart. I was delighted to discover discover that the movie was based on a book . Unfortunately after finishing the book the movie pales in comparison. This is an amazing story and I recommend it to anyone who intrigued,, by magic, romance and enjoys a good wizard duel.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|the graphics are better. they are much more defined and of higher quality. the response time has been improved as well. I love the new additions of people powerups and the gems.
0955153077|4.0|Wonderful book, very helpful step by step processes. Received it on time, plastic case was broken, but didn't effect the book.
B009GJCFL8|5.0|Asia fans will love this inspired concert. A good selection of tunes, great sound quality and a band on fire.<br />And, as if a great live album wasn't enough, there's also a DVD included of the very same concert. A+ all around.
B00422LESO|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  A romantic comedy.  I read this book in anticipation of watching the movie at Sundance film festival.  There were a lot of differences between the book and movie.  Highly recommend the movie when it is released.  Very funny.  Not at all necessary to read the book before the movie.
B006ZNRD06|4.0|I cant say anything to special it seems to do the job, but its nothing spectacular. I havent used it much lately.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Have really enjoyed the authors other work as well. Love that this story allows you to take a step back and deep breath, reflecting on the gift of each day. Highly recommended
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I will be honest- if you're looking for a fun exciting read that has you blushing yet intrigued- read this series, you will NOT be disappointed. However, if you're looking for a well written novel that doesn't repeat a sentence here or there- don't read this cause you will just get mad! Lol! It's a fun hot read, but that's it! So get a glass of wine and get ready to fall in love with Mr Grey ;)
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This app is good but I another sound app that has more found options.  very nice though and it was the free app of the day!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is an amazing and powerful movie.  It is so awesome that he is performing again, especially in South Africa (where he is an icon).
B003CN4R74|3.0|its ok... My wife really enjoys it.  Made her want the rest of their albums.  So We ordered them too!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Every thing about this game is amazing. From graphics to music to gameplay quell is a 5 star app all the way. And at 99&cent; what have you really got to lose?
B0000041DF|4.0|I bought it as a gift and didn't listen to it before sending it, so I can't really say. But the recipient said she liked it very much.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I loved this movie.  My fiance and I watched it together, and though it does reference some things from the older movies that we had both forgotten, it was very enjoyable just the same.  Bane is a bit difficult to understand sometimes, we had to rewind a few places to catch what he was saying, but it's a great movie.
0979019710|5.0|When I found out Hal was writing this book I thought: \\"I don't need this, I already get up early and do all this stuff.\\"  Most of my adult life I have woken up early and done most of what Hal recommends but it has never been this productive or fun!  The largest measure of success for me is that my wife has been waking up with me--Hal's simple system has done in less than a week what I could not do in almost 10 years of marriage =)<br /><br />If you have read lots of other \\"self help\\" authors it will be easy to see where Hal's influence comes from but what I really like about this book is that it is more actionable than many others out there.  Some books have great ideas but they leave it up to do to take the steps necessary--or maybe they give 2 to 3 suggestions at the end of the chapter.  Other books give you a system that is so set that it destroys creativity and flow.  Hal breaks it down into each part and then shows how the parts work together.  They say that if you get a good workout then you burn calories all day long.  Since I have been doing Hal's system my mind is more creative and my vision more clear all day long than it ever has been before.  For my wife and I this works. . . better than any other system that I have ever done and it is the first system I have been able to get my wife to do--and to do consistently!<br /><br />I have read many books and served with great leaders (one example is Arlen B Crouch who is former CEO of Franklin Covey who I worked with for about 6 months in a service organization and on leadership teams with him) but for me the \\"Miracle Morning\\" gives me direction and vision but without constricting my \\"free flow\\" and creativity.<br /><br />An aged lady once gave her husband a great compliment about how her husband treated her and their children: \\"He gave us roots and wings.\\"  Hal's system gives you roots to dig in and wings to fly--it is a full system that is strong and complete but it can be customized for each day and each person.<br /><br />I am grateful that my wife and I can get up and start our day off better than we ever have before.  Thanks Hal!

0156027321|5.0|I read a borrowed copy some time ago and wanted to read it again, so I bought it. Yan Martel is a wonderfully imaginative writer and a master craftsman. The first time I read it, I got up to the last chapter in one day, but was too tired to finish the last chapter before I went to sleep. But in the morning the first thing I did was google the name of the freighter to see if there was any historical record. Of course, I found none, and logically that was my expectation since I knew the book is a work of fiction, BUT THE STORY, THOUGH INCREDIBLE,  FELT REAL. When I first heard about the film, I was eager to see it, but now having read the book three times, I don't think the film can add anything significant to my great experience of reading.

0765325950|5.0|To Brandon Sanderson: Great job finishing a series that you didn't start. Although there are a plethora of fans out there who would have loved to see Robert Jordan finish the series off, that, sadly enough, wasn't in the cards.<br />To the critics: If you're criticizing this novel, I'm just going to assume you don't know what you're talking about. I've read all the books, and I loved all of the books, all of the characters, no matter who they were written by, so at least for one person, this whole series has been an incredibly satisfying read.<br />To the fans: I'm sure you're as happy as I am.<br /><br />I can't say, honestly, whether this is a book that meets the standards of literary critique that many expect from reviews at Amazon, or whether it fails by several notches. I know that I read and finished this book in a few hours, skipping paragraphs, pushing myself to read faster so that I could get to that blessed ending. While the aforementioned ending may not sit well with everyone, it left me able to put the book down with confidence in a completed portion of my existence as a reader of books.<br /><br />I cannot ask for anything else, because it wasn't my world put onto paper. It was a world that belonged to Robert Jordan, and I'm thankful that I was around for him to share that world with me.

1616550414|5.0|I would recommend this book to any Zelda fan. I was ecstatic to learn that the book would be imported to the US, and it was worth the wait of translation.<br /><br />Design: This is a large hardcover book. Its design seems to have been intended for collectors as the pages are thick and the colors are vivid. It does not appear that Nintendo/Dark Horse cut any corners in the cost of the Hyrule Historia.<br /><br />Content:<br /><br />Shigeru Miyamoto - Intro<br /><br />The Legend Begins - The World of Skyward Sword (about 60 pages of Skyward art)<br /><br />The History of Hyrule A Chronology - This section is neat in that the left side of the pages have a timeline that identifies each game with an era of Hyrule. Skyward Sword is marked as the Sky Era, Ocarina of Time as the the Era of Chaos, A Link to the Past as the Era of Light and Dark and so on.<br /><br />25 years of artwork - One highlight in this section would be the subsection \\"changes in character design\\" where Link, Zelda and Ganon are compared through the different games and years.<br /><br />Eiji Aonuma - Wrapping Things Up<br /><br />Special Comic / Manga - This one has to be read from back to front and right to left. The comic is based on Skyward Sword.

B000000WFF|3.0|I remember when I was a teenager and The Spice Girls were huge and I was in love with Geri `Sexy Spice' Halliwell.  Yes, as a young teen (like pre-teen actually), I was infatuated with what the Spice Girls represented; strong, carefree women who were slinking and lovely to look at, and listen to.  My friends and I listened to `Spice' on repeat for months and yes, we sang along with our favorite girls (the ones we fantasized about actually having a shot with).<br /><br />The funny thing is that for many, The Spice Girls were a fad that they couldn't wait to watch fizzle out.  They were a joke to music snobs who thought that the gimmick was all that tied these girls to the airwaves.  Sadly, many wrote them off, but thankfully their loyal fans kept them alive (and continue to keep them relevant despite them all moving on).  Yes, The Spice Girls are the biggest selling girl group in the world, and it's actually pretty easy to understand why.  They were a phenomenon, much in the same vein as The Beetles were (seriously, I'm not joking), and while talent cannot be compared, one should not begrudge these five women the respect they've earned.<br /><br />On top of that, `Spice' was a really good album.<br /><br />With their sophomore album, The Spice Girls serves up a lot of the same things that made their debut work so well.  With Motown influences (`Stop') and funky disco beats (`Spice Up Your Life') along with the slinky sensuality (`Too Much') that made them an unstoppable force, `Spiceworld' gives us more reasons to adore these five ladies.  Sadly, the album is not as strong a collection as `Spice' was, and some of the more commercial toned tracks are truly dated, unlike the more ageless style of `Spice'.  I still think of them every time I drink a Pepsi thanks to `Move Over'.  The highlight of the album may actually be `Viva Forever', thanks to the Spanish vibe and slinky personality.<br /><br />No, The Spice Girls were the best group to hit the airwaves in the 90's, but they are probably the most memorable and not only because of their outlandish personalities and media obsessed celebrity.  No, if you actually take a minute to really LISTEN to their music you'll see that they were smart women who could not only sing, but they could sell what they were singing.but they are probably the most memorable and not only because of their outlandish personalities and media obsessed celebrity.

B007EDZ20O|4.0|Almost every missionary in India , aspires only  to harvest souls for christ rather than make anyones life better. Missionaries are in forefront of many shady organizations E.g , of all things protesting against nuclear power in a power starved country.<br />There is much civil unrest in tribal areas due their proselytization. In old raj formula  \\"we send the missionaries first, traders next followed by soldiers\\".  The formula still holds except instead of traders<br />it is mafia taking place of both traders and soldiers<br />.

B009O07NDY|5.0|Many reviews have been written already. Therefore, I'll be brief. More lighthearted than LOTR, this music explores more &#34;the journey&#34; linked with nature (The Adventure Begins, The World is Ahead, Radagast the Brown) with the misticism of the misty mountains, the dwarf's longing and grim determination of regaining their homeland (Axe or Sword?, Misty Mountains, Over Hill, Out of the Frying Pan) and the cozy, safe, yet excited, spirit of a very respectable and curious hobbit (Dreaming of Bag End, A Very Respectable Hobbit). These new melodies blend in with existing LOTR melodies already known by our delighted ears (Old Friends, The Hidden Valley, Riddles in the Dark) to make this CD a truly incredible journey...
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Good game challenging, makes you think. Very strategy game to set your mind to. The overall meaning how to plague a world seems dangerous but i am glad its just a game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I used to read everything Stephen King wrote including the Richard Bachman books. About the year 2000, I stopped reading his books. The new ones just weren't worth reading.

0316010669|4.0|Another \\"instant classic\\" from Malcolm Gladwell in his now signature style. The idea this book explores is the gut feeling of instant decision making - and how we can learn to trust snap judgements when it counts. This is not to say that studied research and fact gathering is invalid or unnecessary - in fact, this book uses standard research and academic methodology to actual prove that certain kinds of split second decisions (using what Malcolm describes as \\"thin slicing\\") are just as accurate as concerted inspection.<br /><br />There are many great examples in the book, but my two favorites are:<br /><br />1) The student judging the teacher:  College students were shown short clips (e.g. 30 seconds) of prospective professors and were asked to rate whether they each one was a good or bad teacher before taking the course (with no other qualifications or prior knowledge). At first glance (pardon the pun), this seems to be nowhere near enough time to rate professor effectiveness - no content, no fact checking, no lecture. However, the results (positive or negative) were statistically insignificant from (different) students' post-course surveys whom had taken the entire course with each prospective professor. In other words, the snap judgements by prospective students about a prospective teacher were the same ratings as the students whom had already taken the course.<br /><br />2) The probability of medical malpractice lawsuits:  It turns out, it has almost NOTHING to do capability or skill level. It has everything to do with bedside manor. Doctors who spend more time with their patients, or have an overall good relationship with their patients, are far less likely to be sued than doctors who spend less time or have a gruff or seemingly cold bedside manor. It all comes down to engagement and being in the moment during consultation, and almost nothing to do with actual education or skill level of the doctor.<br /><br />This book just further reinforces the power of the parallel processor that is our brain, and how hard it has proven to be to model artificial intelligence. We don't yet understand completely how we can do certain things so well (e.g. being \\"in the zone\\") or how we can make certain kinds of correlations-to-judgements (\\"thin slicing\\" and generalization), but examining the human animal proves to be an endless fascination of Mr. Gladwell's (and obviously, the many purchasers of his best sellers).<br /><br />On the same topic:  I recently heard about Japanese hen sorters, or specifically \\"chicken sexers.\\" This is a technique, or really more of a subconscious trained behavior, which allows humans to instantly distinguish between a male and female chicken (thereby determining which will be egg producing). What is amazing is that there is basically no difference to a layperson's eye between male and female chicks at an age prior to 3-5 weeks. But, chicken sexers are able to immediately identify the difference and sort accordingly. This is an example (not in the book) of the instant decision making based on some form of unconscious input and the power of parallel processing - much like a well-trained eye of an FBI agent can pick up on an out-of-place element in a room upon first visit.parallel processor that is our brain, and how hard it has proven to be to model artificial intelligence.

0345803485|4.0|you really have to be open minded about the book. I heard it was sexual but did not know the details. it can get really kinky but I loved the book.sometimes though I had to put the book down because they were having sex in almost every page.I want me some Christian grey, that is all I have to say. it would be nice to find a hot eccentric millionaire. the reason I did not give it a full give stars was because sometimes the authors writing bothered me. there was a lot of monotone in the book. still this is a fUN book and worth the read.

0316017930|5.0|With this book it is safe to say that I am now a stalwart Gladwell fan. In this third installment, he gives his unique style and treatment to the topic of \\"what makes a person successful.\\" Borrowing the term outliers from statistical anomaly, Gladwell describes the various circumstances that he believes have contributed to the wildly successful people of our time and in history.<br /><br />He does this not to reduce the accomplishments of people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, or John D. Rockefeller - rather he shows that there are supporting factors which have led to waves of possibility, creating an environment and structure for certain types of success.  He does not discount hard work either: Gladwell outlines what he believes is a core component of the success of those outlined in the book - 10,000 hours of work in your discipline (whether that is violin, computer science, law, etc.).  He posits that this is the amount of hours required to become a world-class expert in any subject. He also posits that becoming an expert alone, without a bit of circumstance to help you out, will not make you a household name - or rather, an outlier (on the high end). He even tells the tale of one of the smartest (in terms of IQ) people ever, and the troubles, and lack of success, that person has encountered in spite of this ultra intelligence.<br /><br />This work feels to me to be a blend of some of Toffler's ideas (macro historical action) and of course, Steven Levitt's (of Freakonomics fame) approaches to using odd statistics and trending to find new patterns of causation which might have been missed in popular culture.<br /><br />Two interesting examples include:<br /><br />--- The case of the well-known billionaires:  Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, et al are all household \\"Computer\\" billionaires. Gladwell explains that this is a case of these people recognizing a coming wave of opportunity, crossed with a tempest of being in the right place at the right time with the right people. Gates was one of the first people ever to have dedicated terminal access to a mainframe computer (an era where most other users had to punch out thousands of punch-cards instead of virtual code like we do today), with parents that had influence in the particular university that had that system. And, he was at the exact right age (not too old to be established in a career, not too young to be unable to make entrepreneurial moves) to take full advantage of the coming era of the PC. Oh, and don't forget, he had vision. PS: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Bill Joy/Scott McNealy (Sun)... all born between 1953 and 1955.<br />Some of the richest people OF ALL TIME were born together in clumps of years (John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and JP Morgan) during the 1830s ... just at the right time to capitalize on the coming Industrial Revolution in America.<br /><br />--- The case of Canadian Hockey success:  Where are all the December babies?  Gladwell recounts a case where an odd statistic was found that the vast majority of hockey players in Canada (from the \\"little leagues\\" on up to pro) are born in the first half of whatever year they are born in (January - June), with most of those being born in the first quarter of the year.<br />The study convincingly shows that the qualifying eligibility hockey cutoff date in Canada is January 1st. Additionally, this selection usually occurs before the age of 10. This creates the interesting side-effect whereby hockey players are chosen by size/speed/coordination at an early age, favoring the \\"older\\" players (in months) over younger players during a critical pre-teen time. In other words, no late bloomers allowed. Then, a systemic artificial evolution occurs: The better coaching and more game dates per season are given to the \\"chosen\\" bigger, stronger, faster players, further amplifying the effect - then a 10,000 hour period goes by during which these players play more times and better opponents. Then, time to \\"go Pro\\" and theearly selected players (based on age/size alone) are in fact better than the other players that did not get that advantage at an early age.<br /><br />His arguments are convincing, but not so much so that you leave with no doubt. But, regardless of 100% validity (much of the evidence laid bare is circumstantial), the trends are clear and have a real world impact: If we give the same level of focus to all students as we do to more mature-for-their-age students, we will have a better system of education, ergo better society at-large.<br /><br />After finishing this book, you are inevitably forced to ponder your own advantages and disadvantages in your life, and how you might attempt to provide advantage to other young people (at least, as much as is in your control).<br /><br />Bottom line - Love the book, a return to Tipping Point form, and a quick read for any curious mind.early selected players (based on age/size alone) are in fact better than the other players that did not get that advantage at an early age.<br /><br />His arguments are convincing, but not so much so that you leave with no doubt.

B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is brutally bad ass and unique in so many ways. It was absolutely shocking to me, after this movie seemed to flop at theaters (Why should that impact anything, right? Caught myself judging the book by the cover here..) this movie came out swinging BIG time and the best part about it was that it DID. NOT. STOP. Some of these action/adaptions spend a lot of time developing the much desired story... This movie summarized all of that nicely while keeping up with the carnage. I would summarize Dredd as a matrix type of action movie, with some robocop and Clint Eastwood thrown in.. Ha! The detail and driving elements were powerful, the acting fit the films sense of reality, and quite frankly I am hoping they make another. I recommend this movie to anyone who open mindedly enjoys a good action movie that makes you say words like \\"awesome\\" or \\"dude, wooa!\\" with bad guy drug dealers and slummy gotham city like environments. I think you'll be impressed..

Catching Fire sensibly doesn't muck with the formula too much, putting our heroes back into the arena again, but it lacks some of the &#34;punch&#34; of the previous entry.  There was never as much sense of peril, to my eyes, as we know our heroes will find a way not to have to kill one another.  Does anyone really think there'll only be one survivor left standing this time around?

B00003CWRX|5.0|Yes, this has a running time in excess of two hours, but it is worth it to watch this incendiary story unfold.  A man who used to work for a tobacco company suffers professionally and personally after blowing the whistle on their fraud and deception of the public regarding nicotine.  Journalists from CBS' 60 Minutes pick up the story and then become tangled up in the threat of lawsuits and more.  Pacino, Crowe, and Mike Wallace (yes, the one from CBS) give excellent performances. Great soundtrack too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this coin pusher I don't really play it on my Kindle but it's the same as the other systems....
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|We did not enjoy this movie at all. My kids lost interest not too far into the movie. Certainly not his best movie.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book is just going through the motions, as Collins finishes out her story.  While attempting a much more epic scope than the preceding books in the series, Mockingjay falls flat.  The strength of The Hunger Games and, to a lesser degree, Catching Fire, was their emphasis on a very personal ordeal.  Mockingjay tries to graft Katniss's story onto the wider war, but the result is disjointed and rather uninspiring.  It mainly comes across as the entire world operating either to help or, more commonly, to threaten, Katniss personally.  A disappointment.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addictive I must have played for three hours straight.  It makes you think how you can get to the next level and get the prizes with making them fall over the edge.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I especially love the part where I get 3+ million points in, use a save and then it crashes. Other than that it's bit of a step up from the first, but seems to play better on iPhone than Kindle Fire HD (kudos to Amazon for trying to auto correct the spelling of your own product during reviews)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this all the time when I am bored. I love this game easy to understand and play... love!
8866130931|4.0|As a new teacher, organization is truly crucial.  I have really disliked the teacher planners that are available and have been looking for a good weekly planner where I could jot down lesson plans and appointments.<br /><br />Moleskine has a great classical, minimalist appeal.  The paper is of very nice quality and the layout is very practical.  The ribbon is a great addition for never losing your place.  My only gripe, and it's not a major issue, is that I wish each month had a dedicated monthly calendar as well.  I know this would add bulk but it would be nice to have both a monthly outlook as well as a weekly setup available in one planner.  Picky - I know.<br /><br />In an age of mobile technology, and I do love my smartphone, there is something that just cannot replace a tangible object where you can quickly write something down, alter it, add ideas, share with others, etc.  If you are looking for an attractive and functional planner, you can't really go wrong with a Moleskine.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a very great book it is worth all of the money. I recommend buying the book it is funny
0345803485|2.0|This book was not by taste......I was told that it was a romance novel.......I couldn't deal with it but maybe someone else will enjoy it!  To me, it was mostly just raw sex and off the wall sex at that ......not romance that I prefer!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Good animation, fun movie, but some inappropriate content for kids. Over all, good Halloween fun.  Not a movie that I would purchase.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great up the date weather. I like the Weather Channel. I am glad I found this app, it's one of the few I would trust...
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I was concerned that character development would get left behind in Season 2.  A lot of critics claimed that there needed to be more action and focus on zombies, which I don't really agree with.  Luckily, the writers managed to include a lot of action WITH character development and interaction.<br /><br />The highlights are the search for Sophia, Hershel's secret and Rick's/Shane's relationship.  All of these issues continue to provide great depth and complexity to this show and really help highlight the zombie threat.  This season was ended so well, that it truly leaves the viewer wanting Season 3.  I've watched Season 2 twice now and still appreciate the nuances and deep subject matter that are touched upon.  If you are a Walking Dead fan, you owe it to yourself to see Season 2.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is a great addition to the already famous temple run game. I got this fore my kindle fire and I love it. In fact I'm going to play it right now
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down and it was quite captivating. A realistic Romeo and Juliet.

B000FC0OOU|4.0|I wanted to re-visit the work that established Hemingway's reputation, dated though it obviously is. Certainly his unique use of the English language and dialog as narrative still astounds. It's also a thoroughly good read, if a little sentimental by today's standards (whatever they are). He was that most entertaining of writers - a great story teller, telling stories of what he knew ( write about what you know, and not before you know it, was always his advice to anyone wanting to write).<br />I can't give it 5 stars, so much that is good has happened to the novel since then, but of its time, it is timeless.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|All the praise this show receives is for a reason.  The zombies are great for establishing setting but it is the dialogue and character development that are key.  In order to put characters in agonizing scenarios, the setting needs to be extreme.  Lets face it, you can't get anymore extreme than Zombiepocalypse.<br /><br />I really love the soundtrack, cinematography, realistic dialogue and emotionally-wrenching scenes in The Walking Dead.  I don't watch this show to see a crazy zombie kill (though it is a nice bonus) but rather to see how characters will evolve, survive or die.  This isn't Shakespeare but there is a surprising amount of depth and complexity in this show.  If you are at all curious, don't cheat yourself - check out this show.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Don't like this app. can only see the first 10 or so posts then just list of people, can't see posts

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|So fat this is another great book by Jodi Picoult! I'm less than half way through & I never want to put it down! Captivating as always.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This book is a fast paced adventure. It has enough historical accuracy to make the reader question the very foundation of this great nation. I for one, look forward to learning more.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book was descriptive and direct.  Your imagination was put to the test 100%.  A must read prior to seeing the movie.  Was fabulous once you saw it on screen.  Amazing how he survived the ordeal!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Tons of fun! A little morbid, but still excellent! I love that it's challenging but not so hard that it's not fun anymore.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|lots of levels and variations, but could use some copy editing- basically a good, fun game for kids and adults
B00B0ND67K|5.0|Over the past 40 years, Kenny Loggins has sold millions of albums, charted numerous hits and won two Grammy awards. He first achieved success as one half of Loggins and Messina, and then went on to greater heights as a solo act with chart-topping songs like \\"Footloose,\\" \\"I'm Alright\\" and \\"Danger Zone.\\" Now that he's 65, one would think he'd be slowing down, but that's not the case. Instead, Loggins has started a new band, the Blue Sky Riders, and their first album, Finally Home, is a feast for the ears.<br /><br />From start to finish, it's all killer and no filler. Finally Home is an amalgam of rock and country music, and it's filled with infectious melodies. It's comprised of a well-balanced mix of upbeat, mid-tempo and slow songs, and all of them feature excellent musicianship. Moreover, all three members of the group are given the opportunity to shine. The music is layered with beautiful harmonies and soulful vocals that will make you want to sing along.<br /><br />Kenny Loggins career has been like a three-act play; each act has had different tone. The first two acts were excellent, and based on the music being produced by the Blue Sky Riders, it's safe to say his third act is going to be a memorable one. I highly recommend you check out Finally Home. It's a terrific debut album by a band with an extremely bright future.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked the book very much.  Felt it was the usual love story and then the surprise we never expected.  Well done.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It's mobile Twitter, just like it's supposed to be. Haven't encountered glitches or problems, works well. Nice way to keep track of everything on the go.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I've fallen in love.  LLH is extraordinarily talented.  The music is so original I can't stop listening to this album.  The album flows and I can listen to it from beginning to end.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this group and I am so happy that I got this CD for a good price!! I placed my order two days ago and I received my Cd today yay!!!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|The best Metallica DVD! Great concert! I have watched many of Metallia's concerts this is by far the best! Love it!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have used adobe reader lots of times and it has been very useful to me.  I would recamend it to anybody who likes to save documents and pictures.  It's great.
B007YXNZH6|5.0|A Great Film that deserved the Blu-Ray HD Format!  I own the older DVD version and wanted the Blu-Ray HK, Region A version. Visually, the film is beautiful.  Great fun when viewing with TriDef software in 3D (likewise for Ghost in the Shell 2.0 Blu-Ray).  The DTS-HD Japanese soundtrack was great for the sound effects (I don't understand Japanese).  I was disappointed by only Two deficiencies with this release - 1) No English sound track at all (DUH!); Cantonese Chinese soundtrack was Not in DTS-HD (DUH! for a HK release!).  I found the story dialog overly complex and pseudo-philosophical, but the English subtitles and the Cantonese dialog did make it interesting.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I approached this with trepidation -- long-delayed movie sequels generally do not have a great track record. That said, I liked it a lot, and particularly appreciated how they accommodated the many-year gap in the story. It does tend to be &#34;the Will Smith show&#34; to a greater extent than were the earlier installments, but I found that to work out ok. As with the others, a fun supporting cast, with a fine job by Josh Brolin in a challenging role, and great turns by Michael Stuhlbarg and Bill Hader.
B0072A3OGS|5.0|I was pretty much a novice to the world of black folk metal when I picked this one up. I've been a huge fan of bands such as Amon Amarth, Children of Bodom, Dimmu Borgir and such so I was not sure what to expect from this group.<br /><br />I must say that I really enjoy this album. The narrative, the theme, the mix of screaming/clean, male/female vocals, the combination of electric instruments and traditional folk instruments is almost perfectly mixed.  I am glad that I let my musical tastes venture into this genre and I plan on coming back for more.<br /><br />The only downside I see with this album, and only because sometimes when I am listening to it I'm on my bicycle, commuting to work, is the Scorched Earth track.  It is a very nice break in the album, but to keep me charged up it is kind of a buzz kill.  Though like I said, this thought only happens when I am in the middle of an intense commute.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Ugh worst dictionary ever I hate it not good definitions an  is hard to manage I advise you to never buy it
B00701897I|4.0|Great 3D and CGI; Storyline and Pacing were a little slow.  I grew up with the comic and cartoon series, and somehow the screenplay was missing the fun with Tin Tin I had from back then.  Perhaps I've been jaded by the Indiana Jones series.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|The book made interesting reading and I learned a lot about Aspberger's Syndrome.  However the end was very disappointing.  I felt that the story just petered out!
B009QD0MYQ|3.0|Meh, it's okay.  Very \\"poppy\\" I guess and for me that just doesn't do it.  Three vocalists are interesting, but the dynamic mix of screamo, to clean male vocals, to female vocals just doesn't work in my opinion.  To me, what works in a male/female dynamic vocal mix is found in Eluveitie. The album of theirs to listen to, if you're interested in a dual male/female vocal combination, would be Helvetios.<br /><br />So, I give it three stars, knowing that some people will like the album and some won't.  For me I'll pass on by.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Fun game, similar to other match 3 games, but with more strategy and power-ups. Nice job guys. Just a couple more words.

B009EP3C34|5.0|Great CD! I love it. It arrived on time. Definitely going to order again and again. Definitely recommend ordering it!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|The blue ray is great and so is the audio only cds.<br /><br />I was surprised to see Jimmy Page in such great form playing so enthusiastically and leading the band. He used to share the lead with Robert but not anymore, this time he was the one playing great and the leader alone on the stage.<br /><br />And the reason is that Robert was too busy with the monitors to read the lyrics.......so he could not move much around the stage......he was singing great but it was a bit disappointing to see he could not look to the audience or cameras but the monitors most of the time (to make my point clear: this afternoon I was listening to Maiden's last live album, En Vivo. Bruce makes a few lyrics mistakes, but he does not read the lyrics at the monitors so he can keep moving and walking and running all over the places like he does always, and sing!).<br /><br />Which in turn shows that they did not rehearse too much,  confirmed by Page having to signal the end of the songs to the band in almost every song, contrary to Zeppelin's past when the band could play with their eyes closed.<br /><br />This makes me a bit angry with the whole thing because seems like a lack of respect for the past of the band and the fans. Robert was a nobody just like you and me until Led Zeppelin happened in his life. Now, for years he wants nothing to do with that. I understand, that is his life and he wants a new career not a Zeppelin life forever, fine. But when he finally decides to step on those shoes again, he should had at least studied the lyrics again. I am sure he can remember things if he does work on them, he is not Ozzy, his brains are still there.<br /><br />John Paul Jones is amazing as usual. Check out the number of different bass guitars he plays during the concert. Pay special attention to the one played during Nobody's Fault But Mine......what a musician!<br /><br />Jason is also great and honors the family tradition for sure.<br /><br />All in all, wonderful concert, great songs,great audience, the O2 theater also perfect.....if only Robert could remember the lyrics, it would had been perfect.
B0091REZMW|2.0|My sister had this app on her iPad so I wanted it on my kindle. I am so disappointed! The print is so tiny you can't read it and when you touch the item you're seeking it does not respond.
B008742O32|2.0|I tried this app and really liked it but have uninstalled it due to one of the permissions. For some reason the app needs to be able to turn my camera on without my permission or knowledge.<br />Uh, excuse me?  You want to use my camera without my permission or knowledge?  Talk about spyware! I could be in the bathroom or worse and I have to worry about airdroid taking my picture?  That's why I uninstalled it, I would like to be able to control when my phone camera is on, not turn over that control. I think it's a big privacy issue.  So I wrote the developer, here's his reply:<br /><br />Hi Justdave,<br /><br />Thanks for your feedback.<br /><br />The camera permission is requested for scanning QR code for logging.<br /><br />All data transfer is under your local area network and your security and privacy have always been our priority.<br /><br />We will make improvements in the future.<br /><br />Ok, well let me know when and I'll be as excited as everyone else.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I found out about the Perplexus Epic from neverendingstuff.com. I really enjoyed it. My only complaint, and I guess it's not a very good one considering this is the most difficult one, is that it's too hard. Some of the paths seem like it's more luck than skill and precision to get you through. I personally think this is way too difficult for children. It also seems like it could break if it was tossed around a lot, although I had it in the back of my car for 3 weeks flying all over the place, and it held up fine. There are moving parts in it.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend it as long as you're up for an extremely difficult challenge.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|I've really been enjoying this album since I received it as a gift this Christmas. The playing is very genuine, and there is a feeling of freshness throughout. Relaxed, yet virtuosic. Really enjoyable!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is even better than the first season. Jessica Lang is amazing!  I appreciate that the reactions of the characters are realistic and that the characters themselves are so in depth.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book. I could not put it down, but then again I love Nicholes Sparks. You get very involved in all his books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So frustrating but totally worth it!  Sometimes you just want to smack Emily! I was completely engrossed from start to finish.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Full disclosure: I have met Derek Sivers on a couple of occasions and have been a huge fan of CD Baby for many years.<br /><br />There is more useful info packed in this book, which can be read in a single sitting, than in most business school courses I have attended. Sivers' often counter-intuitive advice is backed by real-world success, and tempered with a sense of humanity that is often absent from modern business tomes. Even if you aren't starting a business or an entrepreneur yourself, the book has lots of life lessons that can be brought into play in your everyday life. Skip a couple of Starbucks venti lattes and buy this book instead; it's caffeine for the mind, with a shot of soul.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Each book in this series have astonished me - not only for the originality but the character development and for keeping me guessing every step of the way. It is amazing that there wasn't once that moment of: oh yeah typical third or fourth book in the series. Mr Riordan has kept his writing style fresh and you don't ever get the idea that he'd gotten bored with the series or didn't know what to do with a character.<br /><br />The plot points flow easily into each other and there is a fine balance between fight scenes and character development.<br /><br />If you like stories that involve myths and mythology, then do read the percy jackson and heroes of olympus series. The mythological aspect has been cleverly integrated into the storyline and I personally love the slight tongue in the cheek style of Riordan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun and challenging game which has very good graphics and scenery  have enjoyed playing this game very much.  thank you
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Good Movie watch it with the kids they were fixed to the television just like the power buttons 5 stars!!!
034580404X|4.0|I can not rate this from my personal experience, as I bought it as a gift for a Christmas game. The person who ended up with it loved it! My sister has gone on and on about this book and how it changed her life. If I had the time to read, I would definitely give it a shot. Warning, I am told it will bring out a side of you that you did not know was there.  :)
0553801473|1.0|I've just been notified by Amazon that the paperback release date for this book has been pushed back AGAIN, this time until September of 2014.  Absolutely ridiculous that it will take at least three and a half years to get a paperback to market, and for people who like their series to be in the same format, a hard cover is not an option.  Order cancelled.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Clean layout for the shoutcast channel line up.  I find that it seems to consume more bandwidth that other apps such as Slacker or Pandora so make sure you're on wifi or 4G to enjoy it to its fullest.

B00B2V66VS|2.0|i have a KindleFire and this app works great!! this truly is an amazing and fun game as lots of others have said. i agree with them all totally. Temple Run 2 is even better than the first Temple Run. u may be wondering why i put it at two stars since i love it so much. well its because i enjoyed it for two days thinking it was amazing when one day i clicked it and it force closed. it continued to do this multiple times so i deleted it thinking to redownload it. well the app is deleted but when i go to the app store  the button next to it says Open like i still have the app. when i click the Open button nothing happens. i am very disappointed and am really hoping my dad will be able to fix it tonight. this was an amazing game and i really hope it will work again.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|this app works great on my kindle fire and my android phone.I even paid to get the upgrade to access my work desktop!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This doll is the perfect size for my 18 month old daughter. She hugs her and carries her all around the house. She has a nice soft body that makes it easy to place her in a sitting position in a stroller, high chair, or swing. She has a pleasant vanilla scent. The detail of the mouth, teeth, fingers, toes, etc. encourages my daughter to compare, point, and name different body parts. The doll is very cute and realistic looking. My daughter's favorite doll!
B009GED3HS|4.0|Barney moment with Robin is probably example of one of the finest writing. The way they put everything together was just amazing. So emotional and awesome .

0451232852|1.0|This is not a book. This is the beginning of a three-part story set up to sell 3 books: three times as much profit for the author. (Jeffrey Archer has done the same thing.) While Ken Follett was a good story teller, this crass commercialism is disgusting. The story has no ending, other than \\"Buy Book Two because I need the money\\".<br />Whatever happened to good books from good authors?
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I can't even remember why I bought this, but I don't remember anything bad about it. Therefore, 5 bright Stars!
B000ICXQOM|2.0|This movie was really pretty bad. Hard to know where to start. The whole story was just pretty disjointed and the animation was cheesy. Definitely didn't live up to the standard (if you can call it that) set by ED 1 and 2.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Just what I was looking for! Can be used for standing any direction, the ease of setting up the kindle into the product is perfect!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. Just saw the movie, and even though the actors were great and really like the adaptation of the book in it, the way the author expresses the mental state of both of the main characters in the book, is a must read.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Having a read a lot of IT books I don't recall a book that I have enjoyed reading as much as this one.  It was a book I did not want to put down...literally (you can ask my stewardess who had to tell me several times to turn off my tablet).  I have recommended this book to a number of my work and social colleagues. I even went as far as to gift it to a manager at my current organization.<br /><br />Why is it so good?  It tells a story about DEVOPS that is fully engaging manner.  Having working in IT for a number of years I could relate to a number of characters at different points in the story and sometime eerie so.  More importantly it gives a guidance on how IT people can pop their heads up and really bring value to their organizations by avoiding the tunnel vision that we can sometimes have.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book...so stop reading this review and buy it!!  Thank me later
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I chose to pick 3 stars because it was for a younger crowd, maybe I'm to old for a book based on a freshman. It was okay, it kept me interested for the most part but it was kind of repetitive when it came down to describing the main characters feelings.

B002ABAGVU|5.0|I loved this cd, it's sometimes rare to find a CD that you can literally listen to from track 1 to track 16 and not be disappointed.  I love that about Theory.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This story is interesting but requires that you pay attention at all times.  It does seem to go on and on, mixes up the story timeline but finally gets to the end.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great coming of age book.  I recommend it for teens and adults alike.  There are complex plots but it is very real and touches on tough things high schoolers need to face today.  Fast read and well worth it.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|Worth getting if you have a 3D TV. I really enjoyed this movie but what really sells it for me is watching it in 3D.
B0041VV03A|3.0|Not for the faint of heart, a seriously sick and twisted medical drama. Usually, I'm totally for sick and twisted, but some parts of this movie made me sick to my stomach.

B00AA0U05A|4.0|Emmy Rossum's second CD, Sentimental Journey, features 12 songs, each one an American classic, corresponding at least loosely to a month of the year. The songs date from the 1920s through mid-1960s. To capture an authentic early 20th century sound, the album was recorded with a live band in just three days, using vintage mics and mastered to tape.<br /><br />And, it works. You could actually almost mistake this album for one raided from your grandma's collection of 78s and LPs; the production, arrangements and vocals are all very retro.<br /><br />Rossum performs the songs with her own personal interpretations, though in most cases not straying too far from the way they were originally performed. The result is that they're renewed, giving us a really fresh, fun listening experience.<br /><br />THE SONGS:<br /><br />Rossum dreamily performs the title track, Sentimental Journey, kicking off an album full of romantic, nostalgic songs.<br /><br />&#34;The Object of My Affection&#34; is sung in enthusiastic 1920s style, and its romanticism is perfect for Valentine's day. (The brief spoken-word exchange between Rossum & a male before the final verse is really cute, but maybe a little much.)<br /><br />Another 1920s song, &#34;I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover,&#34; is an obvious - but fun - song in honor of St. Patrick's Day, even though it's actually a love song. It's performed in grand style, with a big chorus, sounding as if it came from a big Broadway production or old-style Hollywood musical.<br /><br />April brings &#34;These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You),&#34; which has been recorded by everyone from Billie Holiday to Frank Sinatra to Michael Buble. A sexy, swingy number featuring jazz piano and horns, Rossum sings it with sweet, wistful longing for an absent lover.<br /><br />May's track, is a slow and romantic version of &#34;I'll Be With You in Apple Blossom Time,&#34; which Rossum says her mother sang her to sleep with as a child, and was a big hit for The Andrews Sisters back in 1941.<br /><br />Next up is &#34;Summer Wind,&#34; a breezy remembrance of a fleeting summer romance. Rossum believably sings in in something approximating Rat Pack style, backed by a sophisticated, horn-filled band.<br /><br />The upbeat &#34;Many Tears Ago&#34; written circa 1960, is a classic old-school country-style kiss-off song to a former lover.<br /><br />Next up is a 1930s big-band song, &#34;All I Do Is Dream Of You,&#34; an upbeat, happy love song which Rossum sings with conviction, backed by her talented band in high style.<br /><br />September brings &#34;Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out,&#34; which was written in 1923. It's been recorded by dozens of artists, including Bessie Smith, Janis Joplin, and Eric Clapton. Rossum energetically & believably delivers this sad tune of a formerly rich and popular woman, now penniless and alone.<br /><br />The next track, &#34;Autumn Leaves (Les Feuilles Mortes)&#34; a slow, thoughtful, song about loss and memory, sung partially in the original French.<br /><br />The mood rises again with The Bobby Darin song, &#34;Things.&#34; It's a pop song written in 1962, but still has a late 1950s vibe. Like many of other songs on this album, it too is based upon memories, but there's nothing particularly deep about it - it's just a fun, joyful, upbeat look back at fun times spent together.<br /><br />&#34;Pretty Paper&#34; on the surface seems to be about Christmas shopping, a close listen will reveal its real subject - a moving reflection on the homeless, who are lost and ignored amidst all the holiday glitter, hustle and bustle. The song opens with a gospel choir, but soon Rossum alone sings with lush orchestration. It sounds like a song you might have heard during the holidays on AM radio in the 1960s.<br /><br />With the calendar year over, the album ends with a bonus track, &#34;Keep Young and Beautiful,&#34; written in 1933 - and very, very old-timey. It tongue-in-cheekly advises, &#34;Take care of all those charms / And you'll always be in someone's arms / Keep young and beautiful / If you want to be loved.&#34; Rossum sings it charmingly (even if its message is debatable).<br /><br />TO SUM UP:<br /><br />Sentimental Journey is an apt title for this album. It's a celebration of romance, of memory - and of the ever resonant tunes of the American songbook which are beloved and reinterpreted decade after decade. This type of music never goes out of style.<br /><br />Since these songs were written over a 40-year span, this makes for a lot of different musical styles, but, happily, the choices made in selecting, producing - and Emmy Rossum's vocal talents - result in an album which hangs together really well. As the album finishes, you you feel as if you've just emerged from a trip to another place & time. It's musical escapism that's a pleasure to return to time and time again.<br /><br />If you enjoy the classics of the 20th century, or are looking for a fresh take on them, Sentimental Journey deserves a place in your music collection.<br /><br />(Disclosure: I received a free advance copy of this CD from the record company. Rest assured that the opinions here are my true feelings. I've happily listened to this CD quite a few times already, and would gladly have spent my own money on it.)ven if its message is debatable).

B0051XJ9YE|5.0|I keep an eye out for the cheaper characters as my son is 3 and still plays a bit rough.  $5 and under is perfect for these diecast models and they are a bit sturdier than standard hotwheels or matchbox cars.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|This is a story of a man who understands how to love, unconditionally, and the woman who can't remember him.
