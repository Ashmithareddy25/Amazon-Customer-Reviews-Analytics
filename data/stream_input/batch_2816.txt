B009H441G4|5.0|One of the best album for extreme metal. It was nicely blend industrial, black metal, death, gothic even deathcore (lucky not so much).... Its remind me of Zyklon....
055357342X|5.0|This whole series is great.  If you're just watching on HBO you're really missing a lot.  Pick these up today!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I really liked this game; I love both the movie and running games.  The main problem I had with this game is that it would freeze up on me on my Kindle Fire from time to time.  Other than that, it's a great game.
0393325172|5.0|This is the start of a great series.  Don't just watch the movies here, folks; these books are the real deal.  I bought the whole series when I was living in Hong Kong, and they were sure pricey.  But it was well worth the 5 months I spent reading them all.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am an extremely heavy sleeper.  I already had an alarm clock app that showed the weather as well on my kindle, but it limited me to only three alarms.  Yes, I do need more than 3 alarms that wake up, even if they go off in succession.  This alarm clock application allowed me to add up to five alarms so far (I haven't found a limit yet) and also has settings like snooze, dismiss, make it where you can never mute the alarm ( I have this set on mine).  This alarm clock starts out really soft and gradually gets louder and louder until it's at full blast..at least it does on the Kindle Fire.  No matter how it operates, it gets me up in the morning.  I have finally found an alarm capable of waking me up.  I still have two alarms on my Kindle Fire, and they both go off when they are supposed to.  I always manage to sleep through all the alarms on the other app, but unable to sleep through an alarm on this app.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the cutest app ever! I can't put down loads of fun I share it with all my friends
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|If you love tower defense games, then you will love this app.  If you have ever played this on your computer, then you will fall in love with the App even more.  To the creators and makers of Bloons TD 5, I give you credit.  This game is addictive, awesome, and has sooo many different things you can do. I've been working currently on replaying all of the normal levels on intermediate.  You can also play both random and special missions, buy special agents and special buildings, but you just need to remember to blow up all the balloons!  Lead balloons, ceramic balloons, moabs, camo bloons, and each tower has a certain special ability that makes it better at blowing up certain types of bloons.  Don't forget you can also set your towers (monkeys,things that blow up bloons) to strong and weak, closest and farthest.
B00051E906|5.0|Great product and is necessary for me for when I travel due to health problems.  Very easy to use. thank you
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game starts off pretty easy and gets harder as you go.  I had a lot of fun with this game, which is odd since I don't really like games like this.  The only thing is that I am horrible with math, and some of these do require you to do some math to make it out.  You match up different clues within the game that help you solve the puzzle and allow you to escape your fate.  I definitely recommend this to anyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The only restriction to this is you must be near Wi-Fi and get a good signal.  Otherwise, this is an excellent application and is quite handy as you can check the weather conditions locally or at any others site immediately.  I really don't see any drawbacks to this application and recommended very highly to anyone that either planning travel for outdoor activities.  Severe weather warning is also a nice addition to this application.  And you can't go wrong with the price.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|While it has a more commercial sound then the album Born This Way, it still has that &#34;gaga&#34; feel to it. I had to listen to it a few times before I liked it, but now its awesome!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is most useful for planning any event such as travel and outdoor activities.  You not only get current local conditions and forecasts, but you can access other cities for their weather conditions.  Should you happen to miss your local television weather report, just fire up the Kindle Fire and get an instant weather reports and forecasts.  Very easy to use with some good graphics.  I highly recommend this application.  The only thing that would make it better would be to add phases of the moon.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I am not an avid reader, so when I do read I want something that really keeps me interested. This book did the job. If I had to offer a complaint, it would only be that through most of the book, as a reader, I felt like I was on the walk with her, but toward the end of the book...I feel the reader is hurried through to the end with not as much detail and explanation.<br />I would highly recommend this book
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I believe every Kindle Fire owner should have this application.  With it you immediately know how strong a Wi-Fi signal, you are getting.  I got it as a free app, so the price was right for me.  Super easy to use and it tells you what you want to know.
B000ICXQXS|5.0|I remember seeing this movie years ago with my parents in the theater.  Brings back good memories of good times.  Newman and Redford, can't go wrong there.
B008M721MS|2.0|This will be my third Skype account.  So far none of them work properly.  My first attempt with Skype was about five years ago and it worked perfectly.  Since then, it is constantly degraded to the point where I get garbled sound and no video.  I thought by having it on my Kindle.  My problem would be resolved.  No such luck.  I think Skype just does not like me.  I know it is not my Internet connection because the next step up would be to full commercial satellite receiving.  It does work okay for instant message, though, but that's not why I bought it.  Yes, I even purchased an upgrade version for my computer and it still does not work.  Skype and me just don't agree.  I sure hope someone from Skype reads this review and offers me some help because their customer service is probably the worst in the industry
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Cool app!!!another thing going for them is that if you give them a good revew, they'll give you more guns!! (written by 12-yr-old son)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app for clock/alarm is the best! The features is pretty cool! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an app like this!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is super fun! The graphics are great and it's very addictive! Although, the next update should come with an actual race mode, not just a timer mode
B000MV8XPG|1.0|The assembly of this is ridiculous.  To the point it made me mad.  Took me one hour to put the body of it together only to get to the base and there are these little nuts that you are supposed to hammer into a metal rod for the wheel.  Never worked.  Fed up,  spent a hundred dollars for something I can't put together.
B0013F1D02|5.0|We loved it!  It was a well-told enchanting story.  Great fairy tale.  Michelle P. was outstanding. Great chemistry between Claire Danes and Charlie Cox.  The &#34;brothers&#34; are perfect comic relief.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Simply love this movie!!! Looks amazing on blu ray!!! A must get for your movie collection. Go get it today!!!
B003U6BE8I|1.0|I decided to watch this movie for a couple of reasons. First, the sequel is coming out so I wanted to find out what happened in this movie. Second, I wanted to try out Amazon Instant Video. Third, a dear friend said it was a good film.  Do not mind the order in which I have stated the above.<br /><br />After having watched this movie, I realized it would not matter if I had watched this film in preparation for the sequel. I was rather confused how Percy Jackson took his mother's death really well. The movie does delve into Greek Mythology, but does so only slightly. I have not read the book; however, from some of the reviews I've read, I imagine the literary approach would have been more rewarding. Despite having A List Stars (not all of them, of course), their acting prowess could not saved this movie from what it has become.<br /><br />I am please with Amazon Instant Video (emphasis on the \\"Instant\\" part). Although, I was expecting that I would be allowed to temporarily download the film; as I have chosen to 'Rent' it, soon afterwards it started streaming. It streamed quite well on my PlayStation 3 console; however, I do prefer having to download a film, as the quality is far better, even in Standard Definition (SD). As with the A list stars in the film, downloading, watching in SD or HD would not have helped this film's...that's it, this film (I was going to mention 'quality', but it seems to be devoid of it).<br /><br />I am curious as to 'why' a close friend would suggest this prepubescent film. I should have trusted my instincts upon seeing the trailer, way back in 2010 - I knew it would be lacking. The only positive marks I can think of are, that there were a few moments in the film that triggered an tinge of familial emotion - only a tinge; the other 'plus' mark is that the SD Rental option is only $2.99. Thank the gods I didn't have to pay a theatre's price of admission to watch this film.<br /><br />The only means with which I would suggest someone watch this film, is if they could find chapters of it on YouTube.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Hours of fun for the whole family, can't wait until the sequel is out on Bluray! No problems at all.
B004RCUJ9E|2.0|I just installed this on my s4 and when my phone scanned it.  It said test protected storage.  No need for this.  Uninstalled.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great app if you loves horses. it is real fun to play and there are a bunch of different games to play in this one game.
1400069742|5.0|This book is excellent  Two things I learned:  the enormous negative influence of Charles<br />Lindbergh on our aiding the Western allies and the surprising foot-dragging on the part of FDR to committing aid to our allies.  He was afraid of negative public opinion but since he was in his third term anyway, what did he have to lose from negative public opinion?
B001EAWMGA|5.0|We got this movie on the day the seller said it would arrive. We weren't sure just how good this might be,we have gotten some that looked like it might be great only to be very disappointed.  However, I have to say that this is one of the best movies that I have seen in a while. The story line is great and the acting is excellent.  Jim Caviezel is one of my favorite actors, he brings authenticity to the roles he plays, he can play a myriad of roles and make you believe that he is that character very easily.<br />I would recommend this movie to any one that likes action and sci-fi movies. There is definitely not a dull moment in the entire movie, we will probably watch this again.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|You have probably heard this before: I like the book better than the movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie was a fun experience. I actually watched it back to back a few times when I had the rental. It was the love for the movie that inspired me to read the book. While it goes without saying that books offer more detail and movies have to edit to allow the story to flow within a specific timeframe, be warned: the movie didn't just delete selected scenes out. It also created a lot of material that does not exist in the book. A LOT. Most people would like to believe that a film adaptation of a novel is like two people saying the same thing, but saying them differently. (Tomato, to-mah-to.) This is not the case for Silver Linings Playbook. The movie and the book are two completely different stories, yet each one is a worthy adventure.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|What can I say..  it is just superb and a must have for any fan of space opera!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in science fiction - space related stories.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|So typical.  Almost even to the point of trying to use the same music as Star Wars.  And such a predictable ending.  Very disappointing.
B000063JZQ|5.0|In my opinion the film is the best adaptation of Shakespeare's story.  It's an adult film, not really suitable for children but outstanding  in the dreariness of the era and archeological detail.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As usual, Dan Brown has broadened my knowledge base through his Robert Langdon character. Every time I read one of his books I come away feeling that I have not only been entertained, but I have learned something.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Really enjoyed this. If you're looking for a philosophy that can maximize your inputs and outputs, this one should be considered!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Great series so far.  Very reminiscent of ABC's &#34;Lost&#34; but with characters we know and love.  Which could change depending on the happenings of the next season...
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Huge advertisements pop up in the middle of the screen that completely block the view of the article I'm reading with no way to dismiss them. Other apps manage to display ads without ruining the app's functionality, I can't believethe Flipboard programmers can't figure this out.  This is uselessware.
0770437400|5.0|I hate Zombies.  I think they are boring.  OK, shuffling hunks of rotting meat.  You run, because they can't.  For heaven's sake, zombies.<br /><br />BUT, I read a review of the movie, which the reviewer did not much care for, however, in the review he had several nice things to say about the book.  And  what he said interested me enough to buy the book and read it.  And I am very glad I did.  It isn't about the Zombies, it is about the people and how they \\"managed.\\"  It is about how governments responded.  It is about how people changed and didn't change.  Brooks creates a totally believable cataclysm and peoples it with human beings, not \\"heroes\\" but real people who \\"deal.\\"<br /><br />Kudos to Brooks and his effort.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved the book. Sometimes, Stephen King can be a little too gory for me, but this book really took me on a trip to the 50's and 60's. I could not put my Kindle down. I was completely caught up in the story.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Good movie. Mostly in line with the comic book. Ties in well with the Avengers story line. Worth watching even if your not a comic fan.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|As most of Jane Austen's stories, I found it delightful. Anyone who has ever enjoyed either Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility will want to add this to their reading list.
B006QSL9XC|5.0|This is a 4.25 hour movie, but you can pause after the first (of three days).  Watching 2 hours of intense action is about right.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I'm sure that it's wonderful once you get into it, but I couldn't get past the excessive chapters describing the bishop. It was tedious for my taste, dull, and (sad to say) I'd much rather enjoy the play and movie over the book. That's something for me to say, because I'm an avid reader and usually enjoy the books far more than the movies.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|If you are hyper-sensitive to a game's immersion, like I am, then you're probably a little concerned that the high-school plot may be a  deal breaker. I thought so too. I play mature story-driven games, with adult protagonists. There was a time when I would really appreciate a high-school aged hero to role play with, but I'm picky now as my taste for games has out-grown most of what is available these days. With that said, I'm also very sensitive to plot-holes, lazy writing and poor emphasis on character development. Pretty much everything you would expect in a Japanese RPG, thanks mostly to sub-par translations into English. Sound like you? Read on.<br /><br />When I took the chance with this game, I didn't do-so lightly. I scoured all four corners of the internet looking for advice on whether or not this game would be for me. I found that the majority of the die-hard Persona fans were about my age (28). Plugging the game into my Vita I kept my expectations low. At this point I was anticipating a game that I would put away as soon as I found the aforementioned flaws in an otherwise typical Japanese to English RPG starring some kid from high-school. As you can imagine, I was uncontrollably looking for any excuse to hate it. I was delightfully surprised!<br /><br />The game is Japanese, no doubt about it, but the English and the voice acting are the first traits that caught my impressed attention. They are absolutely, unquestionably some of the best I have ever experienced in any game of any developer. The talent that went into the characters is a milestone in game development, the bar has really been raised not only for portable systems but in games in general. Being immersed in their lives would be easy, I thought. I still wasn't convinced, however, that the high-school atmosphere was going to pull me in.<br /><br />The high-school thing, thankfully, made more sense as I played on. I guess the developers could have used college as a setting, but it wouldn't reallyfit. I came to understand that the high-school environment serves to help direct the game through a teacher's regular disciplining of students, to the diligence necessary in attending classes, extra curricular activities and otherwise on a very set schedule. That schedule, the piloting of the narrative and plot requires this type of control over the player, so I not only understand the high-school setting, but I have come to appreciate it. Everything in this game is connected entirely. From the people you meet and interact with, the side jobs you take on to the all-out action of combat in the masterfully built dungeons. It all fits in some way, and it all matters. Needless to say, I can't think of any other way to include all of these things while maintaining a natural progression.<br /><br />I also want to note that this game is created with a mature audience in mind. There is profanity, subtle sexual innuendos and typical JRPG violence. There are events that take place which require a mature understanding of things. The game is challenging and appropriately designed with adults in mind, trust me. If you were concerned before about this game not being for adults, you were mistaken; buy the game and see for yourself why some claim this to be one of the best games ever made.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Oscar Wilde has a varied way of description, it's very floral and delicate in some areas, and you get a strong image of what he's trying to portray. Dorian Gray went from this virtuous man-child into this decrepit beast and Wilde keeps you captured in every sentence, begging to know what's going to happen next.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I use an 11inch Macbook Air for both home and work. The Griffin stand raises the laptop just enough to make it a secondary screen. Raising it also makes my setup a little cleaner at home and at work. I have additional space below the laptop, when needed, and if not in used it just makes my setup look cleaner.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|My husband has been looking for this movie with no luck. We are simple people and though the movie didn't not come sealed and brand new he is very happy to have it. Plays great. No scratches. Looks as though it had never been played
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So glad I was able to watch season 3 on Amazon since it was not available on my cable provider.  Only seasons 1 & 2 were available.  By chance, saw that season 3 was available by surfing Amazon.  Can't wait for season 4 to begin.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|The imagery alone is enough to like this movie but it also has a great plot, one where you think you know what's going on but what you think isn't what's real. I don't like Tom, but he did a fantastic job and I'll watch anything with Olga in it.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I made it until almost the last level and got stuck.  could be because im not smart enough to finish it, lol, but it was frustrating because there's not even a small hint and i just couldn't finish it
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I saw this on the Hallmark channel and loved it. Great true story! It' such a touching story too. I liked it so much that I ordered a copy of it for a very special family that I know. I can 't wait to hear how they liked it.
B000056H24|5.0|Every Christian home should have a copy of this film.  This is my 2nd favorite film next to &#34;The Ten Commandments&#34;.  If you watch both films, you're knowledge of the Bible will be greatly enhanced just by watching this film.  I highly recommend this film as part of your home video library!
B008NMT684|5.0|3 year old grandson can play for hours with this app and it gives him the gratification he's accomplished something.  Worth downloading.  Personally, I think it isn't challenging enough, but if he's happy with it, then mission accomplished.
B00061HJ4S|5.0|What can I say?  This is another fine kit from Tamiya loaded with details.  I'm really looking forward to building this kit and the Tamiya 8 ton half-track kit that goes so well with this particular kit.  The German 8 ton half-track & German 88 FLAK Gun kits makes for one beautiful diorama.  I highly recommend this kit from Tamiya.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The movie had great potential, but it really let me wanting more.  I kept waiting for something, not really sure what, to happen but it never did.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Read it really quickly, couldn't put it down. Easy enjoyable read,I really recommend this series's if you have enjoyed the 50 shades and Stark series.
B0064MGU98|5.0|love the characters, bit of drama, bit of romance, kinda real too, very addictive, I'm hooked and they want too many words
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I have been put off by reports of Tom´s personal life. However, this movie proves he is indeed a very talented actor. I was immediately drawn into this movie and the gorgeous scenery, and the story line that Pulled you along for the ride. The story was revealed at an appropriate pace and there were intense scenes scattered throughout that had you on the edge of your seat. One of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in awhile.
0738212415|5.0|Just wanted to write a short review to say how much I enjoyed this book, it really does a good job teaching you the basic fundamentals while still making fun. I like learning while copying and which this instructor lays out beautifully. I just finished the 30 drawings, and had to write about it.  I am now more confident to move forward and draw on my own.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It makes using Pinterest on my Kindle easy to use and it is quite simple.  Better than the web version, this app works GREAT on my Kindle Fire.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|I've always enjoyed reading books by James Rollins.  His stories are fun, scary, and entertaining.  I try to purchase everyone that I can.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is great . Get it it is worth paying for. The minute I started playing I knew I loved it. When it got updated it was even more fun. I play this more than any game
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books are fantastic. I can't complain about the kindle versions in any way and the story is riveting.<br /><br />The price is ridiculous though, they Are cheaper to buy on paperback.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie I knew it was going to be incredible. I knew nothing about Les Mis&egrave;rables and yet there was something about it that just gave me chills when I saw the trailer. Needless to say, when I saw the movie I had extremely high expectations even though I didn't know what to expect. I walked out of that theater completely speechless. It was so wonderful! Something that truly resonates and sticks with you.<br /><br />I thought Hugh Jackman was at the top of his game as Jean Valjean. Finally his theatre and cinema backgrounds come together! The emotional range of his performance is breathtaking. He became Valjean during this movie. I believe this is his crowning achievement in his career. It will be hard for him to top this in my opinion. So powerful!<br /><br />I personally thought that each person cast was absolute perfection. There isn't anyone I would change! I loved Russell Crowe's Javert. I thought it was spot on with the book (that I read after seeing the movie) and I liked his singing. I think it went well with his character. Anne Hathaway as Fantine was superb. Like Jackman, she became her character in a way that you rarely see. Truly heartbreaking. Amanda Seyfried was a wonderful Cosette. She brought all the essence of her character- innocence, love, hope- and I loved her voice as well! Eddie Redmayne as Marius was fantastic. Empty Chairs at Empty Tables was so hauntingly beautiful I don't see how it doesn't make you cry.<br /><br />I could go on and on about each character. They're seriously all so good! I will say this though: I have always preferred a more emotional performance to a performance that's more focused on sounding as good as possible. To me, the more emotional the singing the more real it is. This movie is so raw you really feel like you're there experiencing everything they are.<br /><br />I also love how much the referenced the book in certain parts. Going back to the original source material is always a good idea. I think this movie is a wonderful blend of book and musical while staying true to the emotional core of it all.<br /><br />You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll fall in love with this I promise!a. I think this movie is a wonderful blend of book and musical while staying true to the emotional core of it all.<br /><br />You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll fall in love with this I promise!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This is a pretty interesting book. I am only on chapter 13, so maybe he mellows out in the later years, but so far it is really hard to read because each page has me thinking: &#34;what a self centered jerk Steve is. It is really hat to see such a horrible person become so rich and well loved.<br /><br />The history of computers in the book is excellent though.
B002RTMXIY|5.0|One of, if not the best movie about extra terrestrials.  Despite its age, it holds up very well.  A must watch.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Book two and three were great. Now imagine a book where the characters you didn't like didn't do much. Apparently, the pace can only be great for so long.
B00164CM46|5.0|This was a really good laugh!  I almost did not recognize Brad Pitt because he transformed so well.  Brad is an excellent actor! Multiple story lines dynamic movie.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Great truck.  Detailing is superb.  Doors open and hood also.  There is also a removable sun roof hatch that does not appear in the pictures.  Dumping mechanism and gate function well and allow for us (grandson and I) to play for hours.  We both really like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hilariously FUN, and great way to entertain yourself or the kids. My daughter loves minions, now even more. I have to hide playing it or she takes it from me!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A friend recommended this book and after purchasing,I finished in 2 days.  The imagery was fantastic and the writing was intelligent.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|that is what it is just ok. It is entertaining but not a great movie. For the price, it was worth a look but don't expect a lot in return.
B00D4LTCQ0|2.0|I remember loving loving loving this when I was a kid, so on a lark the other day, I bought this.  In HD, even.  I really should curb my drinking, I guess.  But I digress.  It's not a terrible movie.  It's cute, and fun.  But it's not anywhere near as enthralling as I remembered.<br /><br />In HD.  That's how drunk I was.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|They're batteries.  They work.  And they were cheaper on here than going to any of my local stores. The end.
B00178JDCK|4.0|The reason I bought this pedal was for the &#34;Space&#34; setting, which is essentially a shimmering organ, octave up effect. On the shortest time it is still slightly off with tracking, and it can get crowded with chords, but it does sound ethereal and choir-y.<br /><br />Features:<br />Time controls the delay time between the dry and wet signals, decay controls the length of the reverberations, tone controls the color of the reverb, and mix controls the level of wet to dry (it can basically cut all the dry signal if desired).<br /><br />The trails feature can hold a reverb sound until it decays even with the switch off; however, if your mix is set to max wet signal, no sound will come through if enable and the pedal is off. I haven't really been able to use it effectively, so I just leave trails off.<br /><br />Dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument.<br /><br />Sounds:<br />The classic reverb sounds (spring, plate, room, chamber) aren't very distinct from one another. The hall setting is bit more expansive; the ducking is nice for a continual shift from note to note, removing excess reverb for the latest notes/chords played. The cave and tile are a bit different timbre than the other reverb sounds; and the echo setting acts like a short regular digital delay.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The blue led is VERY bright, as on all Behringer pedals; I just cover it up with a sticker, and it still shows through.<br />*the foot switch is digital, so it doesn't preserve state, and doesn't have the best assuring &#34;click&#34;<br />*because it is buffered bypass, the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it, even when off<br />*the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch, and then lift up<br /><br />Also, almost 50% of the pedals weight is the bottom metal plate, which can be removed, but that makes the pedal almost toy-like in weight.
B002KVZBGA|4.0|Lots of fun that doesn't all make sense but an enjoyable ride none the less. Very much worth checking out.

0770437400|3.0|Well. I enjoyed reading this book. It is a collection of shorts that try to give a global feel of the Zombie War. On one hand, I applaud Brooks for taking a creative approach to the story. On the other hand, by using disjointed shorts, it makes it easier to tell a story without having to worry about character development and continuity. On the other hand (yes, three) he had to create a slew of shorts with only one central character as interviewer - so that too would have been a challenge. I guess as far as zombie books go - it was entertaining. I'm sure the movie will suck nads, but I will catch it on Netflix later this year
0307891372|5.0|really great to have especially if youre a fan of the elder scrolls games. has a lot of tips to help u explorer the land of Skyrim. The game has been out for a while so im sure you can just Alt+Tab look up stuff online. HOWEVER! If you are a true RPer, youd like to have a book beside u to make u feel more immerse in the game as u have a great book to read to teach u spells and enchants!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read it because everyone was reading it. The best one was the second book. The writing is mediocre at best and there is little plot or character development. It's popular smut. It had potential which is what was disappointed. I did read them all and therefore something must have kept me going hence 2 not 1 stars.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|Awesome Movie! Very Clear in Blu-Ray! Wouldnt want this movie in any other format unless they got something more clear than this!
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|Great game. Really makes you use your brain.  Some puzzles a hard but most just require you not to over think.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game its pretty cool i stay hours playing it, its very enjoyable and can be played both kids and adults
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book and the two before were captivating. I haven't read a book prior to these in a year. I believe these were just the books to get me back into reading again. The books heals my interested even made me cry a time or two.<br />I will and have recommend this book to my friends and husband.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game its great to play and its a temple run like game this is a very enjoyable game for all ages
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game and later on it will be updated more and more and for you people who gave it one star you don't know good games
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great and reliable it informs you of your battery information in many ways and gives you the remaing time left and so on i recommend this app to kindle fire users
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's a great game to play when you don t have nothing to do. It is very entertaining. I think it is not boring.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Every week the game should give you 1 heart cause i cant get into live or facebook please please please do that cause i want scootaloo zecora and flim or is it flam
0062238868|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my husband (who is quite a marksman himself).  He couldn't put it down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book affected me so much. It taught me about love, heartbreak, struggle, overcoming sadness, happiness, and life. I can't stop thinking about this book an if you haven't read it, please, please do.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Every book Jo Nesbo has written is wonderful!  This one was particularly good - probably because I have been waiting for it so long!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Wish I could ask for a sequel, but it wouldn't need one. The way this book is written and the characters are perfect. Especially the magic. Another system of magic that drives a story. I want more from this world. More from the main character.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This was for my great granddaughter on her 9th birthday and  I added a doll with it and she loved it.
B000IZ0KRK|3.0|Overall it was a highly compelling and enjoyable historical drama. This was the movie that launched the career of the brilliant and versatile Helena Bonham Carter. Helena was very good on this, as a highly intelligent, and studious girl who brilliantly challenges the dogma of the Catholic Church in her classes with her tutor.<br />It is dramatically done how she is forced by her cruel and ambitious mother Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk , who Sara Kestelman portrayed perfectly in her ruthlessness and cold determination. The scene where she beats Jane in to submission with whip, while Jane is restricted in stocks is just heartbreaking.<br /><br />But some of the liberties taken with history from Jane's marriage to Guildford Dudley (Cary Elwes) went just too far for artistic license. The couple never fell in love, Dudley remained selfish, capricious and childish until the end, Jane despised him and never allowed him to us the title of king though he did beg for it.<br /><br />Furthermore, though Jane may have in her intellectual pursuits have though of bettering social conditions, Jane and Dudley certainly never took any steps as social reformers, even if this can be overlooked as much needed message on the need for social conscience in Britain at a time when Thatcher was waging a war on the British poor (that has never stopped)<br /><br />I did like the way the ruthlessness of Bloody Mary (Jane Lapotaire) is portrayed and how she agreed to Jane's execution to marry King Philip of Spain, but a lot of this is simply not history
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I have never played this type of game before,  and I am enjoying it. There are a variety of challenges you must accomplish to proceed; the game is more forgiving than punishing, and I like the graphics.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Thank Castiel for DVD.  It stems my Supernatural withdrawal while it is on hiaitus or even the six torturous days between episodes.  This was an abnosomily awesome season although way too light on Overlord Misha Collins. In addition to always stellar Jenson Ackles, Jarad Padalecki and regulars Jim Beaver, Mark Sheppard, it was great to have Mark Pellegrino back as Lucifer (even if it's only in Sam's mind).  The inspired casting of Jewel Staite, James Marsters, Charisma Carpenter, and Felicia Day will make any Whedon fan giddy.  It was a strange, funny, quirky, emotional season . . . as usual.  Can't wait for the release of season 8 on DVD.  Death to normalcy!!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I enjoyed the tv series and decided to try the book. Absolutely a thriller with action. I particularly like the style of writing where you as the reader complete the action in your own imagination rather than written graphic violence.  I had suspicions about one character that proved accurate, but was kept guessing for the rest of the story. Baldacci has me hooked.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Another overcooked special effects tale with actors I like, totally under utilized skills.  Sad to see Hurt Locker's Renner take this step backwards.
B008220DGE|5.0|I wanted to see this movie since it first came out.  Everyone was praising Phillip Seymour's performance.  I must say Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performance of his career.  These two strong actors are true match and they battle it out on the screen from start to end of this movie.<br /><br />This story is set in 1950s America.  WWII is over, but many veterns are still struggling with their post traumatic experiences.  Not to mention that many of them feel left out on the personal level.  Women they loved married other people and America is so concerned about the cold war and threat of Communism that society completely overlooks its veterans.  Freddie is former navy officer, shaken by the war.  He has no immediate family and girl he loved is married to someone else and has two children.  Freddie has no education and no calling and his displacement leads him to drinking that eases his emotional pain.  Very few have an understanding for Freddie's lifestyle, so he drifts from place to place unable to hold on to jobs, women and friendships.  Until one day, he comes across Lancaster Dodd (played by Seymour), so called Master who proclaims that he can help anyone find their true self in this lifetime and get read of their traumas that are sometimes carried to this life from the past lives.<br /><br />Dodd is complete opposite of Freddie.  He is educated, flamboyant, man who has been married many times and has many children.  He is also a fraud, manipulative scoundrel who uses people's (emotional) weaknesses and insecurities to make his own living.  Freddie is perfect specimen for Dodd's \\"presentations\\" about healing past traumas in order to gain new beginning free of burdens.<br /><br />I was amazed how savage both of these men are.  And each one of them expresses it differently.  Freddie is volatile, unable to contain his rage at the world.  Uneducated and vulnerable, the only way he knows how to express his emotions is through fist fight.  Dodd on the other way is manipulative and cruel and uses other people to achieve his own selfish means.<br /><br />Do not expect straight forward ending of this movie.  I am convinced that director wanted every person to make their own version of what happens to these characters. But I loved the fact that at the end of it all, Freddie is able to stand his own and create his own Cause - even if it means that he is the only one following it.  Perhaps that is the strength he was seeking all along.way is manipulative and cruel and uses other people to achieve his own selfish means.<br /><br />Do not expect straight forward ending of this movie.

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Even dramatized, this is a great real life story to ask yourself and your family &#34;what if this happened to us?&#34;  What would you do, how would you be prepared?  Amazing tale of life coincidences playing out in just the right way.  Although one of the parent's decisions, if true, was absolutely beyond belief and should never have happened.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This was an interesting book, but there was very little information about how a sniper actually makes the long shots. Could have used more information on operations.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie first, never heard of the series before than honestly..once I saw it I was hooked and bought all the books!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Just like the Lord of the Rings trilogy - this was made beautifully and lovingly was true to the story and the characters.  If you love Tolkien, you will not be disappointed! Can't wait for the story to continue.....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome!!! This game is a great time and I could play it for hours. My son loves the time he gets with this game.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I became interested when there was a free weekend on Comcast for the prior season of this show, but I saw it late on a Sunday, watched a few episodes and got hooked!  I have really enjoyed it - was a huge fan of 24 and it reminds me quite a bit of that show, but with more drama.  I highly recommend it!
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|This game definitely keeps me entertained! Maze-like puzzles, finding all the stars, and surprise happenings (who knew I could go TOO fast and fall off the edge???) make this a great app to have. The background music is actually really soothing and not annoying as some games can have. Sounds are also great! Great job, Risen Games!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I was skeptical when I bought it, but since a friend told me to get it, I did. I started reading it immediately on my Kindle and put the first exercise into practice immediately. The hardest part was to put my skepticism aside. To my surprise, within 24 hours (not 48 as<br />suggested in the book), my desire was made manifest and it was nothing obvious or that it could have happened anyway - I was ecstatic! Still going through the exercises, but so far so good... I recommend it :)
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I had this app on another platform and was happy to find it for Android when switching over. My favorite weather app.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read the book in 1 day, AMAZING!!!<br />Recommended it to my friends<br />Must Read, love the fighter and the love scenes<br />Steamy
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was nothing like I expected. It was so cool.  I loved it. I recommend this game. The suspense and awesome graphics. I can't believe the end.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|The definitive Grumpy Cat!  It was funny all the way through!  Grumpy Cat is up to her usual antics and sends the reader off with a new perspective on life.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|It was good, but personally I preferred Chasing Liberty much better. I did buy it as well to have in my movie collection. I do watch it occasionally. The stars did a good job and she is very pretty.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|love this show...great actors, great writing, great tension. I haven't loved a show since 24...now, I'm hooked again! Gotta watch it!
B0030V0PEW|5.0|This is a landmark book; greatly written, speaks of thoroughly important things that pertains to most industries! Very much recommend it!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this book. I have been working out my entire life but never got in the shape I wanted. Mike breaks everything down for you to understand and use in everyday life! I started utilizing the workouts and calorie calculations and have already seen results in less than 2 weeks! I've focused more on my nutrition and less on 1 1/2 hour workouts! Looking forward to sticking with the program!!!! I love that I easily figured out a Bulk and cut schedule as well as helpful tips on weights, reps, and before and after meals. I cannot be more pleased and would recommend this book to anyone who needs to hone in on their exercise and diet goals.<br /><br />-Matthew
B002N1AEMS|1.0|I purchased what was supposed to be a brand new album, and it was scratched in several places! Contacted seller to exchange, and was told to go through amazon, but it's been more than 30 days as it was purchased as a gift, so I am sol.  Would not buy from this vendor again!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Cheap enough to buy one foe every tv in the house.  Works awesomely with Netflix and YouTube with a lot more coming soon, ie HBO2go.
B008602KQI|3.0|Maybe I thought there was more hype when it first hit the theaters, but I was a little disappointed when I watched it.  It ran long, and had a predictable plot early on.  The ending was disappointing too.  Maybe a little rebellion from the outer districts would have been a nice climax.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I personally have not played this game but It certainly keeps the kids entertained!  They love it, especially after seeing Despicable Me 2 in theaters.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|There are no programs I watch listed.  I would like to delete this application because I have no use for it.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Never played it as it refused to let me install it.  : (  My daughter has the standard Angry Birds game and likes IT.
0756405890|5.0|It's an amazing book that is a must-read for all fantasy genre enthusiasts. The author is just brilliant and paints a great story with words.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this game for my 8yr. old daughter and she loves it!  I also enjoy playing from time to time.  You can select which mode to play in ranging from easy to more challenging.  Nice, relaxing game.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This story drew me in, kept me awake at night and filtering thoughts. As a mother, my heart ached for young Marian. As a wife, I cried for both Marian and Laila. As a woman, I was enraged and encouraged by the suffering the female spirit could endure and continue to persevere.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|I did not know what to expect and I was not at all disappointed. It is NEW and Fresh sound from GAGA
B00785P2QC|4.0|so far it is ok and you earn while not playing which is a great option. I play megapolis also but you have to click stuff to get earnings
B000JCSPG0|5.0|This is one of my old favorite movies. I am glad I have the 30 day trial of Prime. Wish I had a credit instead of debit card to keep it going.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I listen straight through pretty much all the time now, I love the songs! My favorite, even though it's overplayed on radio stations is still Get Lucky
1419702238|5.0|I needed to purchase this for a library book my son lost.  This was perfect!  He even rechecked out the book!
B007IWG3WC|3.0|If u like sharks movies and science fiction is a good late movie to watch get some soup and enjoy it
B001AGXEAG|4.0|Everything is great working!I always wanted to watch this movie! So I got this movie and love it! Recommend you guys watch this movie!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Loved it, can't wait until the next season.  We live in a rural area and can't stream videos via MiFi so this was great to be able to see the whole season.
B00E5C3AJM|1.0|It won't load and when I deleted the game from my device and cloud the music is still playing even though i closed it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie was amazing. All the characters were so dynamic at times you get lost in the movie and even begin to feel crazy yourself. It's so worth the rent and even the buy!
B005N1OUSE|4.0|Back of the Napkin is quite good, but too long<br /><br />Strong suggest you buy it for the codex and the concepts of visual communication<br />However, the book should be skimmed, the written content isn't as strong as the visual concepts
B00005K9LK|5.0|One of the 1st metal albums I had as a kid. Still slammin Vocal and guitar. Great price and timely delivery. I am very happy with the purchase.
B00004R99F|5.0|wonderful movie about friendship between father and son during the difficult teen years - so many fun songs to sing along with. I have a whole new appreciation for this movie as an adult.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|My niece introduced me to this game on her mom's kindle and got me hooked on it so I got for my own kindle. I love it. Simple, yes but fun. Only problem is you can't fix the broken bones and you can't get the nose to stop running. Other than that, great game!
B00DURILJ2|5.0|If you haven't seen any of Jeff Nichol's other movies you may not be prepared for the heartbreak of this movie.<br />Well made, heartfelt with an excellent soundtrack.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 5-year-old loved it. Good movie for kiddies and parents, too. Looking forward to the sequel. Great addition to your animation library.
B009VB97EY|1.0|It was not what I expected. My fault that I did not rent the movie in the first place for sure.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This is a ripping good sci fi story.  Watch it.  Absolutely worth every second of screen time.  Tatiana Malsany is an amazing actress
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|If you liked the first Kick Ass movie, you will love the sequel.  Previous reviewers have already touched on the story, and I don't want to spoil it for you by giving you more tidbits.  Let's just say that Kick Ass and Hit Girl's persona's will be fleshed out a bit more and there is action and intrigue as well as drama(involving Hit Girl).  Go watch already.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Works like it should. Helped fix a bunch of PS3 chips and heatsinks I was repairing. I recommend this for first time repairs.
006197806X|3.0|In some ways I found Pandemonium better than Delirium and in other ways worse. It was easier to get into right from the beginning and keep going. However, the novelty of the world building was gone. It's hard for me to buy into a future world in which we reach a point where \\"love\\" is a disease that must be prevented through surgery. The main character, Lena, shows some growth, but the plot relies on coincidence and twists that are pretty hard to swallow. I'm sure I'll read the third but *spoiler ahead*<br /><br />I'm very tired of dystopian love triangles.
0893860468|5.0|Excellent format of question and answer. The author speaks with an interesting mix of mysticism and bravado. I highly recommend this book, only to those with a background knowledge of eastern philosophy/religion.
B000O599ZS|5.0|One of John Wayne's best movies. The final scene captures it all. Ethan (that's Wayne's character) stands in the doorway, aware that the west he knows is vanishing. He manages to find his humanity by bringing Debbie back to her family, after he was going to kill her because she was raised by Indians. Standing in the doorway he realizes he's part of a vanishing era and can't assimilate into future. He turns and walks away, the end of an era. John Huston and John Wayne worked together on some great movies. This is without a doubt one of the classics of all time.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I got it for my landlord and his wife who wanted to see it before going to Despicable 2. Personally, I don't get it...great for kids
B005K17RU0|3.0|App seems to take extra time to load data. Sometimes a little flaky and erratic, but could be my  wi-fi setup. All told works pretty good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is one of the most fun games I have ever played for my kindle. it is extremelly addictive. I cant stop playing it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Another great book from this author.  Can't wait for the next book she writes.  I am never disappointed.  Love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could relate to Ana and god Christian Grey is so F***** up in so many ways but it's delicious and you just can't put the book down!! Onto the next one! 50 Shades Darker!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Great sound.Lots of tracks I enjoyed. For sure something you could listen to end to end. Definetly worth checking out!
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Seriously well worth watching over and over.  It is non stop hilarious!  It is a sleeper movie in that most have not heard nor seen it, but those that have will agree-  AWESOME!!!
B000AOLT38|2.0|My bad thought I could watch it on my dvd player but it is an antique VHS, nice paper weight
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This really is a great read , it hits on topics that other books shy away from. I had a hard time putting it down
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is a great way to keep track of grocery lists, to do lists, and much more.  It syncs from computer to phone, so I always have my lists with me.<br /><br />I began using it without reading the tutorials, so my rating is based on my using it so far.  It does lots of other things that I have yet to use.  I am sure I will give it another star once I learn to use all of the other features it offers.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|You've read the comparisons to a certain other Aussie outfit. They're accurate. These guys rock hard in the same vein, but harder. Gets my blood pumping. They need to come to Colorado so I can see them in person. Rick on! !
B004T4LUPW|4.0|This product was recommended to me by a colleague who uses it to schedule clients at our office, which does not have an internet connection.  We both previously used the calendar on our phones, but this is nice because the display is larger so more visually pleasing.  I like that it syncs with my phone and computer calendar as soon as my Kindle is hooked up to my WiFi at home.<br /><br />I am still working with it to get each display appear visually exactly as I would like it.  I am assuming that with a little more tinkering, it will be perfect.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|I think that Tom has lost his enthousiasm in his recording . Due to the lack of air time, and stations playing only what the &#34;numbers&#34; say people want to hear. And that's sad for both the listener and the artists.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book.  The best of the trilogy, and so good it made me charge forward to read the other two.  I know it is listed as a &#34;Young Adult&#34; fiction, but I really enjoyed it.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie id's okay if you haven't read the books yet. Considering I've read the books, there's a lot left out in the movie version.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game. I play it every day.Love the graphics.I would recommend it to anyone who likes dinosaur and games.It has taught me  a lot of dinosaur trivia.I give it five stars.
0762445262|2.0|I got this for my son as a night light and it is so faint that you can hardly see it, my husband ended up fabing together a nightlight bat signal on his own.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was ok I thought it needs explosions to make it great in my opinion. That is all I have to say.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|You have to read the directions and then it makes sense and is fun to play.  My 12 year old read it and figured it out and is enjoying it now.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is fun to try to get further in meters also the new items that they add to the game
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I loved the suspense. The book really held my interest. I will probably read others of hers. I hated to put it down and couldn't wait for more time to read.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|She has difference and this is definitely that. I really enjoy lady gaga's music and voice is amazing and I want more everytime I hear it, can't wait for an album!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is addictive . It is so fun to feel like your in the movie and to be a minon. I love and you will to . It is free so what do you have to loose . It is more fun than subway surfers and more challenging. GET THE GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|For just 2 bucks for 5 batteries...WOW.  I am not sure how long these will last but it works.  I used 2 for my bathroom scale and 2 for my desktop computers. No problems.<br /><br />Product came through regular mail in a regular envelopes, I guess to save price.  I understand that.<br /><br />Buy a pack of 5 and keep these on hand. It does work..no worries.
B003HARV98|5.0|I had heard Marina and the Diamonds long before I actually ordered it from amazon.com.  I truly enjoy her singing and songs that my friends and I listen together.  I mostly ordered it for my car and amazon does a great job of delivering quality service as well as great timing on shipping.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|The Game is GREAT and I have to say you got me HOOKED, LINE AND SINKER. HOWEVER BEFORE I CAN PLAY ANY MORE I HAVE TO BUY THE GAME AND I THOUGHT IT WAS FREE WELL IT WAS A FREE TRIAL BUT I SAW THE WORD FREE AND THAT WAS ALL. AGAIN THAT WAS ANOTHER TIME A THOUGHT MADE A FOOL OF ME. BUT AS SOON AS I CAN I AM GOING TO BUY IT. IT'S FUN AND ENTERTAINING.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Our family of five have tried many different Bluetooth products but this one is the best.  The speakers are clear and do not pick up background noise.  It is perfectly portable, holds its charge forever.......and is easy to use. I LOVE THIS!
1451695195|4.0|This is a best-seller that is hard to put down.  Some surprising things it says about the afterlife none of us have experienced and in some ways, fear.  We take our Christian beliefs by faith!  And here was a guy who wasn't even a Christian--until he experienced the ultimate fate of us all--death . . . temporarily!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Purchased on Amazon Instant Video, we came close to giving up on this movie, but very happy we didn't.  It's beautifully done with great actors and great direction.  Let other reviewers tell the story.  I recommend this well written love story of aging stars and the frustrations that go with growing old.
B000I2JDEY|1.0|Great movie if it would play.  To late for return. I ordered in March and decided to watch today.<br />Freezes in screen 11 plus. Tried on two DVD players.<br />What a disappointment.<br /><br />Update:  The company took a return even after the date and I obtained another copy which plays great.
B0083Z614S|5.0|One of my all-time favorites as a kid, The Secret Garden holds up beautifully. I highly recommend to anyone who believes a little bit in Magic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a fan of John Green. I was difficult picking up this novel to read, but I finally did it. After watching vlog brothers, you can see John I in this book.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Most people would loose patience in the first few chapters because of how... &quot;annoying&quot; it is to finish some tasks but I think this is a great game to stretch your skills in common sense and awareness. Most of the time I would just be pressing all over the screen but when I bother to look, the item is right in front of me. Then there's the mini-activities where you have to use logic to see as to what you should do next to solve the task. I enjoyed this to the point where I hated to look for hints. So I recommend this for fun and unintentional brain exercise. But, play and enjoy.
1480507024|5.0|This is soo good. I want a DVD! And want it NOW!! Learned many thing that are not told to us in school.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I liked this game quite a bit. I love that the characters actually speak, it makes the game much more emersive. I did however,  have some very bad and glichy issues tapping on some items toward the last 5 or so scenes which really detracted from the game play. I would love to play the next game in the series - as long as the glitches are repaired. Kindle Fire 1 User.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I'm on Season 2 finally and its actually starting to get pretty good. I love that every episode is different and a unique case.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I really enjoy &quot;nevosoft &quot; games this one could be better though. I really thought the story line was a bit long winded. I really wish the characters would speak like some of the other games and this deffinately a game for those who enjoy hidden object finds. I was hoping for more of a variety of puzzles. All that being said the game was very nice and like all &quot;nevosoft &quot; games the graphics are deliciously lavish. Thank You
B0017VG69U|5.0|This has some special features, which are nice, and the quality is good, since it has been remastered.  Though with the remastering, as with a lot of old shows, sometimes you get too much detail, and can see the flaws.  Still great regardless.
B008220AVW|5.0|I would say dreams can come true if it pertains to society, my dreams will never come true. If Katy Perry is willing to help all her fans, I would like to meet her in person.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Awesome!  I had a hard time putting it down.  I'm not a fiction reader but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
1612680011|4.0|If you're a financially-oriented personal already, this book may be 'nothing new', but for someone like me who has never paid attention to how people make/keep/invest money, I found it super easy to understand-- and though it didn't blow my mind, it motivated me to learn more from other, more detailed sources.<br /><br />Bottom line: a good starting point
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a great game! love it! you should buy it! its great and its great for your kids to! Its all great. your gunman have a great time!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My granddaughter loves this game . She does not want to but it down it is a great way of teaching her how to take care of something without having the miss of a dog or cat.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Give it two thumbs up, it is a great game for all ages, I  would definitely recommend it to friends and family. Absolutely addicting, can't get enough!
0385523394|4.0|I bought this to verify some of the zanier aspects of the Netflix TV show.  Sure enough, it's a much tamer story, though well written and still entertaining.  There are no shank-fights and not nearly as much lesbian sex.  The emphasis is more on the day to day reality of being incarcerated and the implications of our current prison policies.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I was surprised when I realized you could order music through Amazon. Great new country group and CD with many of their hits.

0385340990|5.0|I borrowed this book in large print from the library for my mother to read since it concerned the war years and the aftermath.  Then I read it and LOVED it!  I described it to my husband and was sure to tell him that it all written as letters between the characters.  He decided to give it a try and he really enjoyed it, too!  I decided I just had to have a copy of my own.  I wish she had written other books!

B001AQMBKA|5.0|This is my favorite TV show of all time.  Season 2 was great, as the mysteries of the island got deeper and deeper during season 2!  I actually saw season 2 before season 1.....I didn't catch Lost fever until the show was out for a couple of seasons and my first viewing was some Season 2 episode borrowed from a friend.  Great show and it looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.
1616550414|4.0|As a huge fan of this series and a collector I just had to have this.<br /><br />The only things I hate about it are the lack of Agitha from Twilight Princess and the huge focus on Skyward Sword which is a game I didn't enjoy all that much. But the collection of art is what really drew me towards this purchase in the first place.
B000TFINY6|5.0|This is my favorite TV show of all time.  Season 2 was my favorite, as the mysteries of the island got deeper and deeper during Season 2!<br /><br />I started watching Seasons 1-6 with my kids just recently, and forgot how awesome Season 3 was, too.  Great show and it looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.
055358202X|4.0|THE 4TH BOOK IN THE FIRE AND ICE INSTALLMENT, I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MOST OF THE REVIEWS ON AMAZON, ITS A WHOLE LOTTA BUILDING UP TO WHAT I GUESS WE WONT FIND OUT TIL THE NEXT FEW BOOKS. THE MOST INTERESTING PARTS ARE THE JAIME LANNISTER CHAPTERS AND THE DORNE CHAPTERS SINCE WE DIDNT GET TO KNOW THAT PART OF WESTEROS AS MUCH IN THE EARLIER BOOKS ALSO THIS BOOK HAS ALOT MORE RETELLINGS OF STORIES WE HAVE READ IN THE PAST BOOKS IN THE SERIES BUT MARTIN SHINES A NICE LIGHT AND FRESH SPIN ON THEM AS THE SAME STORIES ARE TOLD BY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.

B003H4I4JU|4.0|Speaker For The Dead is a thoughtful, well-written follow-up to Ender's Game. The characters are well-developed including the aliens. We have an opportunity in this book to get inside the thought process of an alien being, as well as gaining more insight in to the Ender character, now an adult person. The other main characters are well-developed and interesting in their own right. The colonists on the planet where all the action takes place are of Portuguese descent, and devout Catholics. This Portuguese connection was at first somewhat disconcerting, but as the story develops it works very well with the religious themes that play out as an integral part of the plot. It also doesn't hurt that the author spent some time in Brazil, and is familiar with the Portuguese language. That familiarity lends a bit of realism to the colonists.<br /><br />If you like your scifi to have some intellectual meat, and go beyond the &#34;shoot 'em up&#34; space opera, then, I think you will enjoy Speaker For The Dead.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise anyway, but being bored and crappy weather made it a perfect movie afternoon. That said, I thought an action movie would be a perfect mood lifter. I couldn't have been more wrong! Once again Cruise's performance was more than laughable. It seems like his movies are getting worse and worse. The fight scenes were horrible. It was like each step was counted in really bad choreographed dance. The only good thing about the movie was Robert Duvall. Then again I have never seen him in a bad movie. I usually read the book before the movie and probably should have here. After this movie, I have no desire to,it was really that bad. The Reacher series probably is good. Although, after Cruise is now Reacher, I think I will pass.
B007MAETA8|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to actually like this album. I've been a JM fan since his first radio hit but he's fallen from grace the last several years. This was his first work I've purchased since Battle Studies (which was hit or miss) and I even more look forward to what's coming next.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a cleverly written story and kept me going throughout, even when I began to see what was up!  A good summer read, and I have told a couple of friends to read it, too.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|A lot of the time, even though I saved my work, it wouldn't be there when I reopened the program, so I got into the habit of copying and pasting my papers because I didn't know if they would be there.

B00A8307BG|5.0|Have several new blues cd's and this one is by far my favorite.Go Robin!So I guess he should keep going.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The story was so well written and from the point of view of Enzo the dog. After the first few pages I had no trouble accepting Enzo's insights on the lives of the humans he lived with and loved. Enzo is a wise, compassionate and loyal friend, If you have ever loved a dog, you will love this book. This story evokes so many emotions, I cried and laughed out loud. In the end it's an uplifting story and one I will not forget.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I don't abuse my Kindle, and this will do just fine for protection with minimal bulk. The stand is a nice bonus, and it does work just fine.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|A lot of people do not know this but this movie plays a very deep part of my history. My dad probably saw it when he was little and when he grew up he shared it with me. And now I am sixteen years old and I am happy to share it with my little sister. You know movies like that are just to good to keep to yourself. I also really like because a lot of people don't really know this but this is the last movie Walt disney himself ever made before he died. Yeah so you got no complaints here. Will I share it with my children and grandchildren? YES DEFINETLY.
B007EDYN36|5.0|After I finished reading Ace Frehley's Book &#34;No Regrets&#34;, I started hunting on Amazon for more books by members of KISS.  I chose Peter Criss's book based on reviews and price (quite honestly).  I believe he tells a very accurate story of what went on behind the scenes during their best years.  I've not yet finished the book, but it's very entertaining.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|Ultimately, the book did not deliver on its strong opening thesis. After laying out the issue and defending her right to speak from her POV, Sandberg backs away from concrete recommendations to address the problem

B005GG0MIS|3.0|The content seems to be driven by what material was readily available, as opposed to a carefully plotted balance.  In spite of that, an interesting take on Presidential history, worth reading.

0670026638|4.0|I thought this a very good book in many ways and although it did take me a long time to get into it, I found it a very involving and rewarding read in the end.<br /><br />Ruth Ozeki writes very readable prose which is sometimes rather beautiful but never tips over into the self-regarding.  The story, well summarized elsewhere, is of a writer (Ruth) on a remote Canadian island who discovers, washed-up on the beach, a container with letters and the diary of a Japanese schoolgirl (Nao).  The narrative alternates between the diary and Ruth reading it and investigating its story and its author.  I confess that I found the first 100 pages or so difficult to get into and a bit stilted and self-conscious, but Nao's voice and her insights into Japanese society drew me in eventually, and I found her story involving and touching.  I never quite felt the same about Ruth's sections which always felt slightly artificial and mannered to me, although Ozeki generates a very good sense of place and atmosphere around the characters.<br /><br />There is a lot of philosophical content here, much of which is very good.  It includes some rather profound insights about love, about growing up and learning to look outside yourself and about Zen.  Late in the book there is also quite a bit about quantum physics.  My heart sinks a bit when I realise that a novelist is starting on quantum physics because it often degenerates into dreadful nonsense, but to Ozeki's credit she gets the physics right, although I thought that her drawing of parallels between quantum physics and Zen were less successful and didn't really add up to that much.  (But then, from Fritjof Capra's The Tao Of Physics onward there has been a great deal of nice-sounding verbiage and a good deal less real substance written about physics and Zen, so she's not alone.)<br /><br />I could also have done without the mystical elements toward the end.  (I won't give any spoilers)  I could see what Ozeki was driving at and why she structured it as she did, but in a factual narrative it seemed a little silly in places.  Not quite Carlos Castaneda, thank heavens, but heading that way at times.<br /><br />This review may seem rather more critical than I mean it to.  I enjoyed the book in the end and think it had some important things to say.  I did have reservations, but would still recommend it as a readable, intelligent and in places quite profound book.ctured it as she did, but in a factual narrative it seemed a little silly in places.

B00C1TOTK0|5.0|As a 12 year old boy I saw \\"Shane\\" on it's first release in 1952 and more than any other movie \\"Shane\\" showed me that movies could be more than just mere time killing entertainment. I'd previously been exposed to Roy Rogers westerns, Francis the Talking Mule comedies, Disney films and Republic and Columbia serials and liked them a lot but \\"Shane\\" showed me that movies could be so much more. I started watching for movies with the same actors, the same director (George Stevens), even the same music composer (Victor Young). \\"Shane\\" was my absolute favorite movie as a teenager and I saw it so many times over the years I almost can recite the dialog all the way through. I've owned copies of it on 16mm film (alas in black and white!), Betamax, Laserdisc and DVD but all of them have left something to be desired, some a lot to be desired when compared to the original 35mm. three strip Technicolor prints. This stunning Blu-ray finally gets it right for home video, the next best thing to seeing it in 35mm IB Technicolor. \\"Shane\\" remains a personal favorite, certainly one of my ten favorite westerns, maybe even one of my ten favorite films and I can't recommend this stunning Blu-ray any higher! At it's price it's a bargain beyond belief too! Get it if you love westerns or love the movies!
0143114085|1.0|Ridiculous premise, terrible, hackneyed writing.  I forced my way through a couple of chapters then gave up and just read the ending (which was even worse than I expected it to be).  Don't waste your money.
B005M2V2K8|3.0|I guess I thought this toy would be bigger, more squishy like a bean bag, or just more fun. It's small enough it would fit in a coffee mug (a large one). I paid too much (my fault for not knowing enough about the product), and now it's at the bottom of my daughter's toy box. It's cute, but I wouldn't pay that price unless you're a Ty product collector. Want more details? Contact me through my website.
1250012570|5.0|The book trailers on YouTube don't do justice to this fantastic book. The ending was a huge train-wreck of a surprise. (I totally didn't see it coming.) And I'm anxiously awaiting more books by this author. I did a more detailed book review of Eleanor & Park on my website.<br /><br />LOVED it!
1575666286|5.0|The book was very informative and easy to read. I enjoyed the easy to understand methods and directions given in the book.
B003Y5H556|2.0|I bought this movie super cheap on the day after thanksgiving sale or the week following it. Can't remember. But the movie was not what I was expecting at all! It's way to dark and the story line really didn't fit to the story book tale.

0345803485|5.0|Though it is erotic...I love the story between the characters as they change each other. They find their grey area together.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|I hesitated for some time on reading thus book. But I listened to John Oliver on The Daily Show\\" and a reviewer on Amazon who said it was a very good read,  I did not find this so. The author states many times he agrees with someone and others don't. I find this very confusing. The book was difficult to read with the insertion of other book titles, authors, publishers. This was all in the bibliography so I'm not sure why it was also in the text of the book.
1451695195|4.0|I like this book so much I bought one for my mother in law.  It was very enlightening.  A portion of the book seemed to be rambling but overall I would recommend.
0439813786|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I have read it to several classes of students. My daughter reads it in summer camp. Because it has so many pictures it sparks a lot of conversation. A must read
1476715904|5.0|Oh, wow! This is the first book I have read by Colleen Hoover, and I heard so much about it I bought a copy from her signed at the Florida book bash event. The story was unexpected, and truely blew me away. I would call this an NA(new adult) book, as the characters are above 18. Don't expect sex, there isn't any although some people think that is what NA is. I blew through this story, I blew my nose, I am blue that I am done. This is a fabulous story for any age person. Now I understand how this became a best seller.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I used this to re-paste my Thermal Paste on my HP DV6 notebook. During normal operation temperatures the pc would raise to about 75 degrees, after applying this stuff it would only raise to about 55-65 degrees. That's a 10-20 degrees drop.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Liked most of the book except after the four agreements he kind of went off into space for me but the book itself no matter what your political or religious beliefs are have merit. Very quick read as well.

B00ECU2RGY|1.0|This was a slow moving movie and lacked quality special effects. It almost reminds me of a old Star Wars movie, it might be the guns that they use, they look like something a storm trooper would use.
0545265355|2.0|It had a page ripped out of it and just was sitting in the box. not okay and I want my money back...
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|really enjoyed this book-Mitch Albom has a very distinctive style of writing-would recommend to my friends to place on their list
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book was excellent! It was written from the perspective of a novice hiker who makes mistakes that any person would make that was not a seasoned hiker. It made me want to go out hiking! It also was a story of a young woman coming into adulthood and coming to a sort peace with a tragic loss in her life. Cheryl Strayed is a fabulous writer and her emotions pour out page after page!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Simply a wonderful book. The story telling, wild imagination, and flow of the authors writing is amazing. I don't have much extra time these days, but found  myself waking up early just to read a few chapters. Te fairy tale element was so refreshing and well rounded. Most definitely would recommend.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This is an awesome movie for Stallone fans like myself! I love everything he is in!  Great picture on my TV!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I am an old school gamer who is not talented with jumping and shooting and swinging during games. I can't use tilt or swipe very effectively either. I die quickly and get tired of trying over and over again to get to the next level. With this game, there is no skill involved really. Just match 3 or 4 or 5 tiles to earn gold, wood and stone, kill the monsters and get food and drink to run a little longer. Simple but totally addicting. I've reached 10,000,000 points to earn my &#34;ultimate reward&#34; twice already, but I just start the game over and run some more!
0544139453|5.0|Compelling reading I couldn't put it down save for pausing to reflect when I could easily identify with certain thoughts and feelings connected to the main characters. Moshid captures the sensitivity of an educated immigrant in a world and culture that is not of one's own.
8866135909|5.0|I ordered one for my self 3 years ago.  Since then I have had to place an order for at least 10 or more for everyone in my office.  Everyone loves them.  I just wish there were 2 pages to write notes in between the weekly calendar pages.  I have a long to do list at work!

B007THA4FI|4.0|I have never read the HP series and was not frightened off by those fans who did not like the book. I found it to be an interesting study of caste and character. Don't listen to those who say that there are too many characters, if you enjoy a different, interesting read, this book is definitely worth your time.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|think it is the perfect app and its free so you dont have to go to the store buy the cards then sort them and go through the mess
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|It's a very pretty game. Levels are challenging but once in get stuck it seems easiest just to slide things around until I have three stars. Still a great little diversion.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun and addictive! Great adventure and graphics. Keeps you guessing and running for hours. Challenging, exciting, fun, addictive, entertaining, stimulating!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The only problem was that I don't know how to launch different items back at enemies in the battles, but I can figure that out. Overall, a great game that followed the movie extremely well. The graphics and the sounds were incredible. Plus, who doesn't love the minions?
B00CF34B2I|2.0|&quot;Internal error&quot;...app no longer works...very disappointing.  I also received an error stating &quot;you do not own this app.  Please provide update or refund money.
B007857FOO|5.0|The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 1 is great.  Its such a great romance that it makes you think that you are a part of it and would love to be with them.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|I don't care what other reviews say, this is a fun movie to watch. We had two adults, twin 19 year old girls, and 15 and 18  year old boys. Everyone loved it. We watched the sequel the same night and were not as impressed. It's still a fun show, but it didn't have the feel to it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|An entertaining game that takes mrore than a few minutes to figure out.  And replayable if you put it aside for a couple months.
B002ZG9968|5.0|Although romantic comedies are not usually at the top of my list of favorite films, I just had so many moments in this film where I had to stop because I was laughing so hard.  There is a very good chemistry between the two main stars and the storyline is not new but is presented well.
1938469011|3.0|I will not discredit the fact that the author has spent much time researching and interviewing brewing and hop growing/using professionals to obtain the information presented in this book. I was not a huge fan of the way it was written. I found myself quite interested in the narrative stories about the history, specific breweries, etc., but quickly felt overwhelmed when those stories switched to newspaper/ journal article style (quotes intertwined in story) and then morphed into technical points/statistics about hops, growing, alpha acids, etc. I know all of these statistics are important to understanding the hop plant and its use in brewing, it just seemed the information was thrown in ad hoc wherever it seemed right. It also felt like a section would just end and then the same pattern would be repeated in another. It made for quite a disjointed read at which some point in time I labored to get through, just to say I completed the book. In terms of practical uses for a homebrewer, the middle section with hop varieties is probably the best section of the book. I kept thinking while I was reading that the book seemed geared towards brewers that were taking the step of going pro or were already pro (there was so much emphasis on selecting hops from hop yards, how large breweries utilize hops, etc.) instead of practical information that a homebrewer could use on a day to day basis of growing and using small amounts of hops in their beers.<br /><br />I would still recommend it as a reference in the history of the hop plant and how it has been used throughout brewing history. It is also useful in understanding the changing perceptions of hops from a brewer/grower relationship.
0446554995|5.0|I fail to see why people are slamming this book!! So there MAY be a tiny case of Deus Ex Machina or two....But hey! It's a fictional escapist piece of very entertaining fiction!I love Pendergast and all of his attendant sidekicks.I would,however like to see more of Constance,as she is very intriguing Oh,Fast shipping too.
B000KGGIQO|5.0|I love and am interested in all things Johnny & June. This definitely does their life justice- both Joaquin and Reese were phenomenal! Truly an amazing story and journey and a GREAT movie to boot! Watch it!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|My family and I loved this timeless classic.  I have a 10 and 14 year old. It has excellent cinematography.  I would highly recommend.
B00BS40SQ8|2.0|Try a different available version of this. Recording highs & lows are rumbled or faded. Other options are out there & I'm sure they sound better than this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow, this book was suspenseful from beginning to end!  It was hard to put down...even at after \\"The End\\" I wanted more!!!
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Rarely do I purchase albums anymore. I am happy that I bought this one. The whole thing is pretty darn good-- I would not skip past a single song. A rarity!
B0069NGB8W|5.0|Its a great product, the packaging is very natural. Most products are made that way today. We often are too busy to go look for DVDs amazon is a great place to find just what your looking for. Its a romantic thriller about kids who grow up and learn about their supernatural ability.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|I am having a very hard time staying with this book. I place a lot of value in the reviews when I purchase a book at this price.  But so far it is just not holding up.  I am going to take a break and maybe come back later to finish, and who knows I may have more to say about it
B003K16P3M|5.0|I love this book. It is most definitely a new favorite of mine. I love fantasy novels. Give me a strong heroine, castles, love, and fight scenes and I can be content. However, I may be easily contented but it takes a fabulous story and something with a twist and maybe something I've never seen before in a story line to WOW me and make me want to turn cartwheels. As I'm not the acrobatic type, lets just *pretend* I did a full out gymnastic routine at the end of this book.<br /><br />Random thoughts on a topic:  Spoiler..sort of.....read on if you've read a previous review that discussed the topic of marriage in the book...<br /><br />I had read a few reviews that balked at the topic of the main heroine disliking the idea of marriage and I disagree with those reviews. If I had a difficult life of being treated as a dog and as a pawn, I would think it would be a terrible idea to bind myself in anyway to another person in any way. Honestly, I applaud the idea that a heroine can be her own person, be strong and make a life for herself without being dependent on someone else to do it for her. Not every happy ending needs to end in marriage and babies. Marriage isn't bad. Having babies isn't bad. However, it's not for everyone. Happily-ever-after can mean a lot of things and I'm ecstatic that this book is different. Hats off to you Ms. Cashore!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omb mojang you have out done yourself!  this is amazing! I give you a love it review on deviant art.com username: fishskillet
B00E3RC90K|4.0|If you lived through the Return To Forever age and liked the style it created, you'll LOVE this music! The genius of Chick Corea, the hard swinging of the entire group, the over the top musicianship, and the finest recording technology and engineering available anywhere, make this album worth at least five stars!<br /><br />I rate it at four stars because of my disappointment that the album graphics and text are not included in this package. Get it together, Amazon! Not even a simple list of the musicians, composers, and artists! You can do better.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I have really enjoyed this app. I use it frequently. Helps me to turn my brain off. Looking to get full version soon. The only thing I can see to make it better would be to stay on when I want to look at something different. Will shut off if app is closed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is super fun and gets more and more challenging as you move from level to level. I was stumped on level 10, so get ready to put on your thinking cap!
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Stated Permission: Write to external storage<br />Actual: Change USB Storage Contents, Test access to protected storage<br />*I'm not saying those are necessarily bad permissions, but sloppy reporting from the dev.<br />**This is the first FAOTD from this dev that actually let me win.<br />***With multiple options for layout, checker type, and difficulty level, it really is a 5 star, but one off for sloppy reporting (above).<br />****Works well on Samsung Galaxy SII phone.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Every collector of American movie classics, simply needs this trilogy as part of their collection. It was shipped intact and I'm very pleased with the value of my purchase.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I really liked this movie. Of course I am 73 years of age,  and in my second childhood perhaps.  I also like fantasy like this. I did not know what to make of the beginning with tiny screen and all black and white. I kept trying to make the screen bigger, silly me, Then I realized it would all change and it did once he landed in OZ where the screen  got larger and color came then.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|My brother is a huge fan of this series. I bought him this collection for his birthday. To my surprise, it arrived the day before. I couldn't have been happier. I was afraid I had taken too long to figure out what he would like. Needless to say, he was very happy and so was I.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|it broke in the seconed month so i dont think you shold get it but if no options you should get it
B005723JSQ|4.0|Not too keen on the ending as it seemed cliche and a tad unbelievable, but engaging plot and I was invested in the characters. One of my favorite Kinsella reads.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's fun on a bun. Good way to kill time and its oddly addicting. So basic yet so effective. Graphics are for beautifully. 5/5 in my book.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I am really glad k bought and added this app to my kindle fire. it is really easy to use and I plan to use it every day now. thanks.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Loved the app until I discovered that my finished photos would not save to or upload from my phone...HTC Droid DNA.  :(
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book. After reading the TWILIGHT books, this book is a refreshing story of vampires with a terrific plot. I would recommend this book to all my friends.
B00821OX98|4.0|Interesting series so far. Nice to not have commercials. We thought we missed the pilot, but it seems they are telling you what happened with backstories.  Lots of twists and turns in the plot.  Keeps you guessing.
B00271HTLI|4.0|Although the first 3 HP are not my favorite I can watch them over and over. Good movie, great series
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|One of the best free apps to play mahjong! Thanks  for the app!!! Would definitely recommend for other users to try.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|The Maze Runner starts out slow and has difficulty lifting off the pages for a while. Fifty percent of the book was a little dull and frustrating. The main character Thomas constantly whines and asks questions that other characters refuse to answer. It's really frustrating, I cannot stress it enough.<br /><br />However, that being said, once you get past the first half of the boom the second half picks up drastically. The pace quickened, questions get answered, and your allowed to see the depth of the word James Dashner created. I would recommend it to any young adult/YA-sci-fi fan. It's definitely a good, quick read.
B000XVT7SW|5.0|Jon Vickers! what a brilliant Pagliacci, so different to the others, his rendition shows a great strength of character, Pagliacci in this recording is more of an inner suffering person, brilliant performance, Kabaivanska is her usual marvellous self a totally reliable performer no matter which role she is singing, as for Peter Glossop his Tadeo is terrific he shows up his mean and vindictive side and also his suffering side, he knows very well that he is never going to win over Nedda but he never gives up, his glee when he tells Pagliacci of Nedda's tryst with Silvio is total satisfaction and and revenge. Jon Vickers performance here impressed me so much that I have ordered his DVD of Otello.<br />Cavalleria Rusticana is a brilliant performance with Fiorenza Cossotto as Santuzza she is a totally  magnificent performer no matter what role she is singing, Cossotto to my mind was the most brilliant mezzo of her era, the tenor Gianfranco Cecchele (where have they been hiding him?) I have never seen or heard him before but judging by his performance as Turiddu I will be looking out for more performances from him, incidentally if you want to see a brilliant performance from Fiorenza Cossotto find her Azucena in Il Trovatore, she will knock your socks off. DVD D2839 from Kultur.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I bought this book from another retailer and enjoyed it so much that I felt compelled to leave a review here also. Outview is a riveting story of the personal journey of a young hero whose world turned around in a sweeping revelation of a paranormal life and destiny he could only have imagined after the death of his father. In this revealing, magic-woven, fantastical fiction that I could almost relate to, Brandt Legg takes us to a whole new dimension of time-travel, mystery and the haunting demons of a past life that your young hero could only have imagined in so real a world. I can say how much I enjoyed this story. Recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|LOL!  I love the minions!  This is a fun and addicting game. This is def not a toddler game though
0345529057|5.0|I ordered this set and it came sooner than I expected. The books were practically new and had clearly never been used. Price-wise, it was the most inexpensive option and great quality. The series itself is also very good, and I was extremely pleased with my purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game.  Challenging and quick..if I die,I get all upset. Very fun thank you for making something not so bloods guts<br /> And horrifying.
B00433SVP6|5.0|I've been reading Rick Riordan's books and I love them! These are one of my favourite series. Really look forward to reading the second book of The Heroes of Olympus...
B001NLL93W|5.0|There were many things I didn't expect and I couldn't stop reading for a moment.A lot of gasps and I knew it moments but I am totally satisfied in the end. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|Ok so know that when I got this app there was trouble loading, but It loaded.<br /><br />But what is the deal with all the blood! I mean even I was sick after seeing those<br /><br />pictures! I am so deleting this app!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Hope this will be a great asset to me. So far I have not been able to find how to set the time hope you have instructions.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Didn't see that happening!  The last scene with the discovery of &#34;the book&#34; and the look on his face was priceless!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun,just challenging enough,expect each level will be a bit more difficult<br />Terrific and a free app at that !!!!!<br />Looking forward to each new puzzle
B007L5LD9O|4.0|I admit it....I am a sucker for anything about England in the &#34;good old days&#34; where everything was so slow and everyone had a role to play in keeping the rich, well, rich?!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this app! The puzzles are fun and challenging, but most of all, Om Non is SO CUTE!!!!! Menus are straightforward, wonderful game and franchise!
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson is truly a gifted writer, as at home with the lighthearted humorous aspects of travel and daily life as he is with weightier topics like the workings of the universe or the English language.  \\"One Summer: America, 1927\\" may seem like a daunting read at first (as it nears 500 pages) but Bryson writes a compelling story of one summer that forever changed America and the lives of its citizens.  In one summer, Charles Lindbergh, Babe Ruth, Al Capone, and many others, shot to prominence and changed the course of history.<br /><br />Bryson begins with an examination of Charles Lindbergh and the race to be the first to cross the Atlantic.  After WWI, America was woefully behind when it came to aviation, making what Lindbergh accomplished quite a feat indeed.  Bryson then focuses on Babe Ruth and how his ability to hit home runs forever changed baseball.  Bryson focuses on the roles that presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover played during this influential decade, and examines everything from prohibition to the Sacco and Vanzetti debacle to tabloid reporting to technological advances.  While Bryson focuses on a particular historical personage, he interweaves what is happening in the larger world or with others from that time period.  There is a lot of territory to cover and Bryson does so with wit and aplomb.  What might often be dry topics in an American textbook are brought to vivid life by Bryson's deft writing.<br /><br />\\"One Summer: America, 1927\\" is a master work of historical nonfiction.  Bryson argues successfully that out of all the nicknames the 1920s acquired, it was truly an age of invention and progress.  For the first time America fashioned itself as a force to be reckoned with, shifting the focus of leadership from Europe to the West.  And with Bryson's clever commentaries and effortless writing, these are stories that leap from the past to live anew.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very direct & well documented. A juxtaposition of the reality of our faith vs conventional scientific wisdom. This was the only book I have read after &#34;Heaven Is For Real&#34; by Todd Burpo.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|This game is so fun and addictive. Game play is smooth and the levels are fun and challenging. Give it a try.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I am not really a fan of Martin Scorsese.  His films do not really interest me and ones that I have actually seen I found to be boring.  However, Shutter Island is the exception.  I found this to be a great mystery story and the one Scorsese film that I really enjoy.  It has a great look to it, great atmosphere, great score great suspense, and a great cast.<br /><br />The cast is great.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives a great performance here.  DiCaprio gets a bad rap from many people because of Titanic.  I personally did not think he was bad in Titanic.  It is just that the script that he was given was not very strong.  Plus, ever since then DiCaprio has definitely proven that he is a great actor by doing films like Inception, Django Unchained, The Departed, and this film.  Honestly, Shutter Island has actually become my favorite DiCaprio film.  I even like this film more than Inception.  In this film he plays a feral marshal and World War II veteran named Teddy Daniels.  He is hired to investigate a disappearance on Shutter Island.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo is in this too as Teddy's partner.  Ruffalo does a great job here as well.  I think he does a great job in anything he is in even if the film is bad.  Mark Ruffalo is one of my favorite actors working.  Although, truthfully I actually could not tell that was Mark Ruffalo at first.  He looks very young here compared many of his other recent films like Zodiac or the Avengers.  Ben Kingsley also stars on the film as the doctor who runs the island who may be more than who he appears.  Kingsley does a good job at playing a creepy and shady doctor.<br /><br />The main thing I love about this film is the atmosphere.  This film has a very eerie and mysterious atmosphere to it.  The look of Shutter Island was quite creepy.  This place really looked like a real insane asylum.  The actual crazies were creepy too.  I would not want to be around any of those people.  The score also really helped create the atmosphere.  The score wasbrilliant.  At times I thought the music was a little over-played, but overall the music was great.<br /><br />I was also very intrigued by the story and mystery behind Shutter Island.  It was fun watching Teddy try to uncover everything.  The third act was very fun until we get to the very end.  This is the one issue with the film.  There is a very M. Night Shyamalan esc twist that I did not entirely buy.  However, it did not ruin the film for me.  Some people will probably not like the twist, but I did not outright hate it.  This is probably because I saw it coming.  I got spoiled to the ending online before seeing the film so I was somewhat prepared going in.  I still thought was a great movie.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Shutter Island.  It is both my favorite Scorsese film as well as my favorite DiCaprio film.  It is a fun and eerie mystery film.  You should enjoy yourself.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I would recommend reading this book, but be prepared to read with the Author going back and forth from the beginning to the current as she details the events as she writes. I got bored at the end when I read her journals, and when she talked about the horses, but again, she is no professional writer; just someone telling her own personal story.  For that, I gave this 4 stars.  I'm just relieved this ordeal is over for her and her girls and I wish them the best life has to offer.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Couldn't put this book down. One of his better books. Great story, a page turner, hard to put down. A must read.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Brought back some great and fun memories of watching MacGyver when it was playing on television.  Looking forward to Season 2!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very mind relaxing  , I work long hours at a Hospital and to sit and play a game that gets u out of your head and let's you decompress is a super bonus for me
B008XG1X18|5.0|Excellent app... I have gotten so many great ideas. Definitely recommending this to my friends.<br /><br />My favorite stuff to look up are things for my kids.  There are always hundreds of ideas to keep them busy.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Detective Bosch continues to entrance me.  This story had an eerie quality to it and I was captivated by that.
B0099HUB8Q|5.0|I loved the down to earth reality of the day to day activities of James, Siegfried and Tristan.  It is such a far cry from veterinary practice today at the time it is written about there were little or no medications available for the vet to prescribe or apply. The whole series is well worth reading.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Compelling story.  I love following this detective series, I almost feel I know the characters personally and can relate to them
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Good cast, but it left me wanting more, or a different twist.  It kept going in too many directions, I did however, like the SCIFI feel it has to it.  Some of the toys Tom Cruze has, I'd like to have myself.
1250012570|5.0|My daughter is really enjoying this book. She need some items from the same writer, because she love it so much.
B009R659L8|5.0|A truly engrossing story.  I read the book in one day as I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait for April to arrive for the next book.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I Thank suits is edgy, Witty,  and Entertaining! How many words does it take to say good series. two more I guess...
B00CATSONE|5.0|One of my favorite sayings is I never let reality get in the way of a good idea.<br /><br />I have always held Tesla as a hero ever since I first heard and subsequently read about him over 40 years or so ago.<br /><br />This short essay/biography is a must read for those who have ever imagined and known with conviction that their idea or vision of the possible held significant merits! Whether technically, artistically, or philosophically this tome will be inspirational for those who dare to think outside of the bounds of those who for profit and other gain wish to suppress any new or otherwise fresh thinking, products or processes.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This film is a classic and i love the diamond edition- its only a few dollars more but you get the BluRay + DVD + extra content- I highly recommend
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I use many of these episodes when I teach biology at a community college.  Great information and incredible pictures.  Would highly recommend to anyone interested in what the world holds.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I really enjoyed this collector's edition. Usually special editions are just a repackaged flashy version of the original with a minute or two of extra content but this far exceeded my expectations and it was definitely worth the money
B003UESJH4|5.0|I've seen this before and thought it would be a great gift for my in-laws. They loved it too and we are going to watch it again this weekend - this is NOT a chick flick!
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this app. I use it daily just for the new info and horoscope.I even got my daughter to get it.I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B008602KQI|5.0|When this movie first came out I had no interest in viewing it. This week I had a few hours to kill and was browsing around for a movie to watch. I decided to take a chance on Hunger Games (plus it was free $$$) and I was really surprised! I had very low expectations when I sat down to watch and as the movie continued I found myself very caught up in the storyline. It is sort of quirky but a fun ride nonetheless. I now see why Jennifer Lawrence is in such demand. Great supporting cast as well. There was no over-the-top bloodshed nor any nudity/sex scenes. Easy to watch flick!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I saw it on TV first, and had to own it!  One of those films that you never hear about, but wow!
B009AOFNU4|3.0|Seriously, this thing is so tiny it's almost ridiculous. I have very small hands and yet I found my hands cramping after a short period of time. Nevertheless, the construction is flat-out amazing. I never worried about it getting damaged when I put it in my pocket, and yes it's small enough that I could do that. Outstanding battery life too, for the time I had it (at least a week) I never had to recharge it.<br /><br />Ultimately, the smallness of the unit made it uncomfortable to use for any real length of time. I ended up purchasing a Moga Power A which is larger, but has much better ergonomics. It's a shame, this thing was very expensive and I had high hopes.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Very fun game been playing for awhile now and love the different rooms, love the tourney room the best. Wish you could get more cards than once a day but I try to make them last.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Wasn't sure about the purchase but it was a good read.  Both the characters and the plot were well done.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Great movie. very funny. language was a little bad, but if you don't mind, then it's a really great movie!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I am a devoted fan of Neil Gaiman's writing.  This story just did not engage me as much as some of his others.  Perhaps it is more of a Young Adult novel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome me and my sister love it and the best part is u Don't have to pay for updates it just updated today get this awesome app Don't waist your money on other bad apps like minicraft portal edition but my point is get this app you'll love it
B002QS1O36|4.0|After watching 300 (about 300 times) enjoying the quality of the action (translation: 300 barely clad men) I watched this movie because let's face it, Gerard Butler was HOT in 300..  And then after watching this.. I just.. I have no words.. But, since this movie was made in the 90's..  it's safe to say.. Gerard has moved onto roles better suiting his style (NO MORE SINGING... FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE...)
B000MD9UJC|3.0|Ok it works OK but I will tell you it's NOT the same; the led is way brighter but I could NOT focus the beam as the light was designed??  Doing this &#34;mod&#34; also voids the warranty but as you already know, these are almost indestructible by design. I do like the on/off switch on the back, which is better than the original design but I'd just purchase a new led light next time rather than &#34;modify&#34; one.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love Lindsey's stuff and decided I needed to quit being a slug and just listening to it on YouTube. Not disapointed at all.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Nice tracks, and beats. Don't have too much to say, so far 3 favorite tracks, expected more collaborations. But in overall good music.
0671015206|5.0|The book had a wealth ( no pun intended ) of information I was not aware of. The authors did a lot of research and proved their findings.  Would recommend this book for anyone wanting to build up their savings.
B008J344BQ|5.0|Lots of up beat songs, great track w/Eminem has become my weekend anthem. Overall great lyrics, melody and beats! She should get more radio play with this album! All tracks are worth listening to.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Finally have the solution to transfer video & pictures to my ipad. Works great, just insert the memory card into the adapter and plug into my ipad.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I wrote a review in August because I knew it was an amazing performance by Madonna and had seen some of the Epix footage. Unfortunately what I didn't foresee is that the the audio and the picture quality of the blu ray is just horrendous....so much so that I erased my first review before the release so I could write this one. If you look at all the positive reviews they are ALL before the release date. Like many others are saying, the picture is grainy and is NOT even DVD quality, let alone Blu Ray quality. Some are saying the picture is bad to disguise her age but It was alot more clear in the epix feed from what I saw and I never thought Madonna really cared about her age. The Audio is the worst. Now I understand it's because it doesn't come out of all the speakers. In the beginning when Madonna comes out you can barely hear her, when it's a moment that should be loud. It also has an echo that rings in your ears. There is no base and at times the volume is lower and higher like it's not quite connected. It made it difficult to be able to keep the volume on one setting the whole time. I have a hard time believing that that this would meet Madonna's standards as part of why she takes so long to release stuff is because she spends all this time perfecting it! I'm stuck between what I wanna do. Since all the reviews are the same, exchanging it isn't really going to matter. I hear the DVD is not \\"as bad\\", however I don't want to settle for a DVD version when I have a big screen HDMI surround sound TV. And I also hear the DVD has defects too anyhow. It's making me think that maybe I should just return it and get a refund. What a major disappointment. If this isn't corrected or acknowledged I will be very upset. Until that happens this is my review.......
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Having read earlier reviews it seems there was a save option that actually worked, but now people report they cannot save the pictures. I have not been able to save them since getting the app, so it is actually of no use to me. If I could save them I would use it, but if I can only upload to facebook, them I'll have to remove it.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I really enjoy this bag it holds both my camera and my camcorder plus accessories!! I would really recommend this to anyone!
B001CQONKY|5.0|Can you dig it? Just the characters alone are more than a person expects<br /><br />Plots are crazy all over the place<br />Actors are for real<br />Will this show ever end? I hope not, in fact bring more!
B0000C5RQF|5.0|There a bunches of performances of The Magic Flute.  Some are good, some are bad, and some are really spotty.  This one is gang busters from the opening chords.  The Flute is sometimes a tough work to present, given that there are actually two stories twisted together.  In this cast, both stories shine, and given who's doing the singing that's not a surprise.  The Prince is solid, Pamina (Dorothea Roschmann) delivers another great Mozart performance, but the two that really steal the show are Diana Damrau as Queen of the Night and Simon Keenlyside as Papagano.  She simply knocks every note out of the park, and he's wonderful as an Everyman with simple needs and simple desires.  The whole cast just makes it happen, and David McVicar's production will be the model for years to come.  You'll not regret this purchase, even if you're not an opera fan.
0399255370|5.0|the most charming, inventive and funny book.  My four year old grandson who loves to draw and color laughed out loud at much of The story.  It hits the  right note with toddlers who love to  color. rings true. as soon as i finished reading it he asked me to read it  again!
B0014CQNTK|5.0|I saw this movie at the movie theaters twice because it was that good. Once it came on DVD I had to buy it, too.<br /><br />Its such a great little story about a high school teen that accidental gets pregnant by one of her friends. the humor is quite different but very effective. I just like the development of the whole story.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|There are some very very very very  very very useful features and without a lot of clutter.  I would recommend this app.
0440242576|5.0|John Grisham just knows how to write. I don't like his legal novels, I can't get past the first couple of chapters. I like fast and fun reads and he sure knows how to cater to this.<br /><br />This is such a fun little novel. The two main characters live in a town or more like a street where Christmas is a huge deal. Everyone decorates their homes and somehow these two characters typically have Christmas parties at their house. They spend ridicules amounts of cash for the holidays.<br /><br />This time, their daughter graduates college and heads down to South America to work with the less fortunate. This gives the two main characters the idea of skipping Christmas and going on a tropical cruise instead. Using all of the Holiday money for a much needed vacation.<br /><br />Its just so funny how they go through hoops trying to avoid buying a Christmas tree, cards and overall decorations. They're been pointed at and pretty much get the town to look down on them. The whole book is so comical and the ending is just so entertaining.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel, specially right before the holiday season. It really does put you in the mood.
B0006399FS|5.0|Released in November of 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb was met with a lot of hype and big expectations. It had been four years since the band's last album and coupled with their own iPod and the massive hit of \\"Vertigo\\", it was a lot to take in and an exciting time to be a U2 fan. I loved this record at its time of release and nearly nine years later it still holds up. Some fans and critics complained that this album didn't break any new ground sonically, which I'll admit is true for the most part. However, I don't believe a record needs to be innovative to be great and in the end it's the songs themselves that determine an album's success. That's where this album really shines.<br /><br />\\"Vertigo\\" was a well-deserved hit and an example of the band having fun with their big sound. There's a louder and more abrasive edge (no pun intended) to this album, with a more stripped-down aesthetic that recalls their early albums like Boy and War. \\"Miracle Drug\\" is my favorite cut on the record and a classic slice of everything that makes U2 so great: Edge's chiming guitar, Bono's passionate vocals, inspiring lyrics, and a soaring chorus that blasts off to the stars. When it comes to big anthems there's simply no one else that can deliver them as well as this group does. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" is Bono's reflection on his relationship with his father. It's a tender moment but the lyrics are also just vague enough that the listener can easily transport them into their own life, another U2 staple. The fuzzy rocker \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" sounds quite unlike anything the band has done before and it allows Larry and Adam to display their brilliant rhythm section through a meaty bassline and pounding drums. \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is a joyous frenzy of Edge's signature guitar work and a driving rhythm that carries it to another level, while \\"All Because of You\\" is a playful rocker that once again gives Edge room to demonstrate what he's really capable of. In many ways this feels like an album really centered around him and it's a masterful example of just how diverse and talented he truly is. \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" harkens back to the band's trademark sound and yet it feels just distinct enough that it pulls you in and becomes one of the album's best moments.<br /><br />While the record is certainly more rock-oriented we get a few softer numbers to balance out the running order. The acoustic soul of \\"A Man and a Woman\\" is sweet and funky, while \\"One Step Closer\\" is a haunting and atmospheric ballad where Bono once again returns to think about his father and how his death impacted his life. \\"Original of the Species\\" took a while to really grow on me but after seeing it live it won me over. It's quite beautiful with each member getting a chance to shine, not to mention its gentle and uplifting message is one of Bono's sweetest moments. \\"Yahweh\\" is a joyous closer and confirmation that the band still keeps their faith front and center. It's a hopeful hymn of thanks to God and a perfect closer, bringing the album from a start of fear and uncertainty to a conclusion of hope and acceptance.<br /><br />Is the album groundbreaking? Not really, but then again it doesn't need to be. U2 has spent their whole career pushing boundaries and planting themselves in new soil. This album feels as if they've come full circle, embracing their past while looking to the future. It's a record full of big anthems, infinite passion, and a thirst for truth and justice. In short: it's everything these four boys from Dublin stood for when they formed in 1976 and it's something they still pursue passionately as grown husbands and fathers. As long as they seek that route they will always excel and the music, regardless of whether it's experimental or just a bit more familiar, will always resonate. This is what it's all about.f.

B0001I561E|5.0|We received this DVD, and upon a mechanical defect with it, the customer service involved in getting a replacement was excellent!  Not only did they go above and beyond by sending us a replacement, but they also credited our account for the shipping charges, and the turn-around time was very speedy.  Email communication was nothing but the best.  We would definitely order more movies through this company!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The perfect app for access to all the files on the Kindle. Anyone familiar with using Windows Explorer will find this app very easy to use.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It was well written and as an  historical novel provided so much insight into the struggles (and joys) these two people went through because they chose to live their lives in a way unconventional at the time.<br />As the title indicates this is from Mamah's perspective and describes the heartbreak over leaving her children, her life with Frank, and finding her own identity in the early 1900's.
B000000W94|5.0|Gary Moore was a great guitarist and he was able to impersonate (maybe not the best word for it) other guitarists. In this he performs a number of Mac's early Peter Green numbers with a guitar given him by PG (I believe)

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game.. Just need more bingo credits sooner than 23 hours. Play with my sister's and we have a lot of fun.
0811876373|5.0|I bought this book specifically to do kitchen projects with my seven year old grandson.  The photos are great and the step-by-step instructions are very clear.  Just round cake pops are really easy and we enjoyed doing this project together.  My thirteen year old grandson even wanted to help with the dipping and the decorations.  We didn't do any fancy characters, we just made balls dipped in chocolate with multi-colored sprinkles on the outside.  We sent the majority of the pops home with the boys, but I don't think they lasted very long.

1439170045|4.0|This is a short read, so doesn't take much time.  Gives a really good insight, from the patient's viewpoint, of someone entering into the world of Alzheimer's or dementia.  My heart went out to the person experiencing changes in her mental capabilities.

B00908DDZM|5.0|I'd heard &#34;Same Love&#34; on the radio a couple of times and liked the message so much I e mailed the radio station to find out who performed it.  As far as I was concerned, that song alone made buying the CD worth the money, but I was happy to find that the whole thing is full of great numbers like &#34;Can't Hold Us,&#34; &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; and &#34;Cowboy Boots&#34;.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I will not discuss the content of this book in any detail. I will only say the following: If you like to read science fiction, read this book. If you enjoy books about warfare, read this book. If you enjoy political discussions, tea this book. If you want to look into the heart of humanity, read this book.

B00CHMBQRA|2.0|The main character's daughter literally made this movie unwatchable for me. She is constantly whining, telling her dad what to do and basically acting like a spoiled brat. If she had toned down her teenage drama, this movie would still have been mediocre but worth watching.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it&hellip;i have a new favorite game to play on my tablet<br />and my kids love to play as much as I do
B00947N6UG|5.0|Great movie! Great for children and very inspiring. There wasn't one part of the movie that wasn't good. I recomend to every one.
B000L53D4O|5.0|Because it was almost 100% the same as one someone else had given her, we did not open it on our recent visit.  I suggested they take it to her child care provider and let her &#34;share&#34; it there.<br />We don't get to see her very often due to travel distances.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down! I loved every minute of it through all the twists and turns. Of course this story will make you cry as it definitely will pull your heart strings! If you saw the movie and have not read the book, it is a must read ! Lots of things in the book that are not in the movie.
1454704225|5.0|I jumped at the chance to review Craft-a-Doodle, the new book by Jenny Doh of Crescendoh Studios. I had just recently purchased another book of hers, [[ASIN:1454704004 Creative Lettering]], which is also well done. Her instructional craft books have this great way of communicating techniques as accessible skills that are easy to pick up and practice. Just grab a pen and paper, then give your inner art critic the day off so you can have fun creating whatever comes to mind.<br /><br />Craft-a-Doodle's exercises are engagingly worded and easy to follow. Just the photos alone will be enough to set kids' imaginations on fire, whether or not they can read the directions. The design of the book really emphasizes the relaxed but attractive aesthetic that will appeal more to the hobbyist than the fine artist, and I don't mean that as a bad thing. The lack of intimidation can be really freeing for both novice and expert draftspeople.<br /><br />The great variations among the exercises will make this a cool tool for getting the creative juices flowing, particularly for people like me who hold back from creating for fear of making mistakes. In addition to the 75 exercises, the artists added more ideas for changing up their methods and producing even more diverse results than they show in the book.<br /><br />This book manages to balance instruction and inspiration really well, making it practical as well as motivational. Particularly for any entrepreneur wannabes, Doh's compiled lessons capture that twee visual quality that is so popular on handmade shopping sites like Etsy. Just beware of copying anything outright and selling it; emulate the exercises to shape your own style.<br /><br />*I received this book free of charge from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This, in no way, affected my opinion or review of this book. Cross-posted at Read Now Sleep Later and Clever Bee

9707704667|5.0|He tells stories in a way you feel you are included in the plot. You feel what the characters feel. His use of vocabulary is so extensive, and sometimes difficult to understand due to the local slang. Anybody would enjoy reading it.
B006XOBFB0|5.0|For years I had different recordings of these brilliant concerti; some by Perahia, some by Uchida, some by others.  They were all wonderful, but I decided to get a full set and opted for this one, not that there's anything wrong with the others (in fact, it was tough to decide between this set and Uchida's).  However, this set is exquisite, perfect, beautiful, and so on - there may not be enough favorable adjectives to say it all.  I can't speak to the other versions of this recording, but the sound on my set is wonderful (so I don't know what those negative reviews are all about).  I can, and do, listen to these concerti morning, noon and night, in any kind of weather, in front of a fire or underneath a palm tree.  They are simply wonderful, as is Murray Perahia; he is every bit as good as the music itself, and that's saying something.<br /><br />If you don't have a complete set of these concerti (and maybe even if you do), get this one, and run - don't walk!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Overall I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />It's outside the box but not too far<br />Similar situations could evolve in the near future
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Delightful story, excellent acting, wonderful photography,good character development, it was a joy to watch, sorry it stopped after four seasons
1439153663|4.0|I had a little trouble in the beginning of this book figuring out who belonged to whom (quite literally). I also struggled with the dialect. I wondered why Lavinia (from Ireland) had no accent at all. Anyway, after I got more comfortable, I was immersed in the story. Of course, I've seen Gone with the Wind and read about plantation life in high school but I'd never been so close to it. I knew next to nothing about indentured servants. I was thoroughly engaged with each of the characters. The plot was easy to follow although upsetting most of the time. The book does much to raise awareness of what many of us have long forgotten.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I did not read any of the viewer reviews prior to watching this movie and I am happy that I didn't. The plot was believable and the story kept unfolding throughout the movie.  There are decisions made by each of the characters, reminding us that sometimes, of the options that life presents to us, there are instances when none of the options seem to be desirable at the moment.  This movie is one fine piece of film-making, directing, and acting.  This will be on my list of recommendations to family and friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|nice game<br /><br />this is a good game and lets me build my own imagination plus I love the survival and all it needs is some redstone and this will be boss

B00632HWOG|2.0|Frequently, Yahoo has trouble loading emails -- sometimes it doesn't do it at all.  Formatting on &#34;reply&#34; emails can be weird.  The service is just contrary.  Moving to Gmail in hopes of better performance.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story was different to any other romance I've read recently because for the characters it was never about romance or the search for romance even. The journey they take you on is very much theirs and has some good points. Well worth giving it a chance as it might surprise you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. It's great if you travel, and can be a good distraction to keep the grey matter working. Beware though; there is no cheating with no cards!
B0014I4KH6|5.0|My daughter loves this cd. came in perfect shape, she always listens to it. Even though I'm tailored out, it was a good cd in great condition even though it was used.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Its nit only good because of the story line, but the connection you build with the characters. This is the kind of book that you know the author had to have cried while writing it, and that makes me appreciate it even more. It gives you a different outlook on life.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game gets very addictive and the puzzles are good too. Can't put it down at the moment. Very good game
B0089EHWQE|5.0|As a former nurse, I was deeply impressed with the medically accurate and skilled portrayal of a tragically quadraplegic patient. The author sensitively reveals the depth of the physical and emotional trauma that results from an accident.  As a reader, I was totally absorbed in this narrative, literally, weeping at times, laughing at others. I have read dozens of books this year. I will remember this one for ever. I most sincerely recommend it.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|Likable and engaging characters: fun plots. Outlandish pseudo-science that mixes lots of comic relief into the drama.  Everyday life in an extraordinary place.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This movie kind of revived the horror genre in my opinion. It lives up to it's hype very well.  It is pretty graphic to warn you but not as graphic as I heard it was-  the future Saw movies became much more gory in my opinion. The only complaint I have with the film is that the screen is a a little too dark and grainy in some scenes but i heard that's what the director was going for.  Also, you may have a hard time believing some of the stuff that happens in the movie and some of the \\"traps\\" the people find themselves in.

B006ZS4HTG|5.0|Our daughter loves LEGO Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. We purchased the \\"Olivia's Tree House\\" Set for her for Christmas and it was a big hit. Since then, we have purchased several additional sets for her collection.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Mia's Bedroom Play Set comes with 85 pieces. It includes the Mia character and plenty of bedroom related accessories. Along with the bedroom furniture, it also has a music focus with several music accessories including a drum set and a radio. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow for a 5 year old. The recommended age is 5-12 and a 5 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />One point of caution. I have found that the average per piece price of the LEGO Friends sets are around 10-12 cents per piece for the smaller sets. That is the going rate from WalMart/Target or when Amazon is the seller. Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more so be careful if the seller isn't Amazon, especially around the holidays when Amazon sometimes sells out.  Make sure to shop around.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />UPDATE:  This set is currently marked as RETIRING SOON on the LEGO web site. If you want this set, now is the time to buy it before it becomes harder to find and more expensive.  Make sure to shop around for the best price.
B00127RAJY|4.0|After 10 days I can notice a difference in the tone in my arms and legs. It's great to have 3 different videos because by day 8 you are tired of hearing the same things. I recommend this if you are serious. Don't give up on yourself,. Remember your worth it :)
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|This is truly a wonderfully funny film and one that has become a classic. Ferris Bueller experiences the day that every teen (and every adult, for that matter) dreams about, a day away from the humdrum of daily routine, a day full of action, a day when everything goes right. Best of all, from the perspective of someone who grew up in the Chicago area, is that it takes place in Chicagoland, which means a lot of familiar scenes, such as the one shot at Wrigley Field.<br /><br />I'm still amazed at Ferris's cleverness in being able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes, including the totally nasty and clueless school administrator (what's not to hate about him?) and his equally clueless parents. I'm also amazed that he's able to pack in so much into his day away from school. (One has to suspend one's disbelief a bit at this point, since it's physically impossible to do everything Ferris does in one day. But who cares? When one is having a dream day it doesn't have to be real.)<br /><br />This is a great, lighthearted film, that is full of laughs for the whole family.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie good characters, maybe a little much for little kids.  Good storyline except that Black Widow role was not allowed to do anything.
B00EI6E17A|3.0|It's okay.  That pretty much sums it up.  I would not have made this the lead single of the album.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|To be honest, I only decided to watch this since it was available for Amazon Prime Free Instant Video. However, by the end of the film I had a new found respect for Katy Perry. I think the most pivotal moment for me in the movie was the confessions the ex-publicist person had to share.<br />Overall, a good watch, especially if you enjoy Katy's music.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I would like the game better if I could link it to my game on Facebook instead of just publishing on it.

B004HO6I4M|5.0|Saw is movie at $1 kid movie promotion at our local cinema. After seeing it we ( me and my 3 year old twins) had to buy the DVD. It's a great, colorful movie with good humor and great songs. I would highly recommend it
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Great classic movie! Even better now with such greeeat quality in not only picture but audio too!! Absolutely amazing quality very impressed :-) Way to go Amazon!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I really enjoy the challenge of playing uno on the internet. For example, you get to play people from a higher rank than you are that makes the chances of you winning difficult. When you run out of tokens the scratch off game allows players to win free tokens to play every 45 min which means you can play often.  Since everyone in my house is too busy playing internet games by themselves and they don't have the time to play with their mom, I can enjoy this family friendly game with my online family.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Excellent film with modern political themes set to an imaginative sci-fi world. Break out performance by the star and seamless CGI makes this movie a wonderful experience and worth the purchase for repeat viewings.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Amazing -- laughed until I cried!  Everything about this movie was so well done;<br />very, very impressive.  Do it again -- and again!

0920668372|5.0|Great book!  I encourage all new parents to get this and read it to your children during their early years.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I remember reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe when I was in the 5th grade. I'll admit, I was probably too young to make the connection to Christianity at the time, but as I aged I was finally made aware of it being an allegory to the story of Christianity. I'm trying to get into the habit of reading to my children each night. I offered my oldest son the option of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe or \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" he wanted TLTWTD over the other. He loved it. We followed up by watching the movie. As always, the book was better.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|These are beautiful and add a lot to the base game. We are hoping to find Dixit3, as well.  Recommended!
B0049U4INC|5.0|I recommend re-reading Guy's book every 6 months. It's a great read and as I said in the subject, it takes &#34;How to Win Friends and Influence Others&#34; to a whole new level. A must read.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Having seen live performance five times and this in the theatre, I wanted to have it in my library to share with my grandchildren. Love the story and especially how much detail this production lends. Good performances.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|Fringe seems to have hit on a combination of actors, writers, special effects and story idea that works. The first season is really entertaining.
144236419X|5.0|I just finished listening to this well-written and beautifully performed cd book.  My heart is still full of the characters and my eyes opened to the realities of the Afghan experience in the past few decades.  This was my first Khaled Hosseini book but surely won't be my last.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I like the 'kickstand' feature, and that's why I picked this one, besides the price. I have had if for just under 30 days now. I use it daily. The corners are starting to peel, and the spine that is supposed to keep it upright when using the tripod feature is giving way. I'll probably need to replace it in another month or two.  I'd suggest sucking it up and spending the extra $ and get a better case, unless you're an occasional user or something.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Our grandson received this for his fifth birthday and loves it.  He already had &#34;Blue Planet&#34;, and I would recommend either or both as a good and educational birthday gift.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I'm a fan of the series I owned the regular edition. I am amazed by it they add so much and the movie is in amazing quality well worth the price, deffinetly recommend this movie.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|I am shocked it has such good reviews.  Mary-Louise Parker is a horrible actress, or at least she was in this.  I guess she is ok in Weeds.  Anyways, if you all you want to see is bad CG explosions and action scenes that make no sense, with lots of bad dialogue in between, have at it.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|I love this movie it's funny and I enjoy watching TMNT. I have not finished watching it yet but I truly like it a lot. The CGI animation is just great for me I love the animation in this film and the action. I recommend this movie to any one who are fans of TMNT or just like the turtles in general :).
B00DURGZHW|5.0|I like happy endings, and this one was a good one. You really didn't know how it was gonna end.
0345535421|4.0|Book is in good shape and everything. I didn't rate it 5 stars because some of the letters were somewhat blurred. What's written is still legible but it's still a nuissance. Other than that, it's perfect.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|There are really not enough words in the English language to describe how much I loved this book. I've read some tragic love stories but this book was just beyond that. Beautiful.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|This is exactly what I've needed to start charcoal for my 8\\", 10\\", and 12\\" cast iron Dutch ovens.  The other size is  ridiculously too large for Dutch ovens.  Some said the handle gets too hot...mine has never done that. It's compact enough to take camping with us - friends kept coming over borrowing it. ;) I've used it for 2 1/2 mos. now and it's still strong as ever.  We use a bit of newspaper under it or have used a couple of ready-light charcoal chunks under it - we only use regular charcoal in it. Well, the charcoal is ready - got to go get the hamburger, beans, and Bisquick on!
0375851569|5.0|Purchased for my 5 year old nephew, we absolutely love them. Best purchase ever. I would highly recomment theto others. You can't go wrong with Dr Seuss
159102594X|5.0|Brilliant, endless action, with likable personages (not all) and an interesting plot. As the back cover says &#34;is black fantasy with a real cutting edge&#34;. It catches you, and at the ned of the book I want to keep reading the whole trilogy. I´ll do it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Great fun..very cool set of toys...a lot of patience and perseverance needed for the Epic. Recommended! Looking forward to what they think of next :)
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watched season one in two days.  .way good. Dont miss it. I csnt wait for the next season to go to prime.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|So awesome!!!! Love the garand!!! I can't believe how detailed these guns look. It takes gun simulation to whole new level
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are incredible,  the gameplay is fun and reasonably challenging, and there is nothing in any way inappropriate, although some budget keeping strategy is needed if you don't want to spend any real money.

B000UO338W|5.0|Ive listend to ministry ever since with sympathy, i love every single ministry record to date, but the political albums have been used way to many times in my opinion so when i saw this record coming out in 2007 i didnt even buy it. But i wanted to own a complete discography of ministry, the lyrics i could care less with but i fell in love with the music, if you like ministry for the music i highley recomend this album but if you like als non politcal lyrics then take heed with this album but give it a shot anyways. For me it was worth the purchase

B00DCRE83S|5.0|VERY IMPRESSIVE... Much better than I expected. I only say that because because I didn't realize Jason Newsted had this much ability and talent with songwriting.<br />He was really suppressed being in Metallica. Good for him that he left and eventually put this CD out. I just hope he will put out more like this and keep this band together. GREAT WORK MR. NEWSTED

B00CBRI9G2|1.0|Save your $4-$5 and watch the trailer! If you do this, you will have just seen a decent film short made by someone who is probably freelancing from the advertising industry.<br /><br />My problem is not as much with this quirky film (yawn... and I can stay awake through almost anything), but with the fact that the trailer and description is totally misleading. Subjective film-making and story-telling aside (as well as lack of plot), the trailer is nearly fraudulent.<br /><br />Take note: This is a foreign film. The trailer is nothing like the film. It drops in and out of French and Spanish and has sub-titles. It should be properly advertised as such. Amazon will be giving a lot of refunds for misrepresenting this film as an English-spoken romantic drama. It's not. Did anyone at Amazon even watch the trailer and the film before putting out for purchase?<br /><br />Now on to the film. I'm a foreign-film buff and love foreign films. Anyone who has slept through films with me knows that I'm really generous with my time watching what I hope turns out to be a good film even when it initially doesn't seem to be. However, even I was not prepared for this pretty-bad film as based on the completely English-speaking trailer composed from bits and pieces of the film, edited out of sequence.<br /><br />One comment in favor of the trailer though - I do think that whoever made this trailer should be nominated for best fake-out trailer ever because they probably shaved at least $100K off the financial debacle of this production. Whenever I see a trailer like this I ask myself \\"why isn't there an Oscar category for best misleading trailers that save film distribution costs\\" yet? This trailer should certainly be nominated (if not win) that category. Bravo to the trailer editor who salvaged a fairly awful film and somehow managed to piece together this misleading trailer. I hope the producers paid you really, really well!<br /><br />Bottom line- misleading trailer and the film not worth your money or time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ok, a lot addicting.  Would be easier to quit smoking I think.  Can't seem to stop.  So much for sleeping.  Guess I'll call in tomorrow.
0446699616|2.0|I read \\"The Panther\\"over a five day period. It actually felt more like five weeks. The story line was interesting for the fist couple of  hundred pages-but then it just became a tedious read. I've read several DeMille books including \\"In Country\\" and \\"Night Flight\\". This book was not of the same caliber.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Just can get really boring after playing it. Also the upgrades get really expensive.But it's way better than temple runner or subway surfer.

B00D6QU6RW|5.0|this album is amazing. I was a little hesitant at first, but once I listened to the first few songs I knew I had made a great investment.<br /> P.S. their 2013 In a world Like This tour was outstanding (if you like the cd, you should definitely go see them live. They will not disappoint)
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|After watching GI Joe yesterday, this was a refreshing, uplifting and thought provoking movie.  The story was slow to build; and I really did not know where it was going to take me.  Of course, I did not read any reviews since I would have liked it for the most part since I am a Tom Cruise fan.  However, I was captivated by the story.  Oblivion was better than Jack Reacher and I thought to date that was Tom's best movie after Mission Impossible III.  Now Oblivion has moved to the top of my List for Tom Cruise movies.
B000000H48|4.0|Heavily influenced by Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, King Diamond's fourth album since branching off from Mercyful Fate and going stag to create his own solo project, 1989's \\"Conspiracy,\\" is perhaps most noteworthy for being a heavily conceptual work. Of course, the musicianship is nothing to be sneezed at, either, here, as this is one exceedingly-well played heavy metal album filled with memorable guitar licks and solos. (And it is an album that, like the stuff released by IM and JP, has heavy prog metal leanings, and occasional journeys into power and speed metal territory.) Here is the story, in a nutshell, for this sequel to 1988's \\"Them\\": A King returns to the House Of Amon to reclaim his throne, but first has to deal with several obstacles, including the suspiciousness surrounding his sister's death, his own craziness, and attempts made on his life by his mother and \\"diabolical therapist\\" in order to inherit his riches. It all makes for one dark and disturbing, yet undeniably intriguing and epic concept, and that is for sure!<br /><br />The album begins on a very epic note, with \\"At The Graves\\" being roughly nine-minutes in length. A really trippy and proggy intro (complete with ethereal falsetto vocals and symphonic-sounding musicianship) introduces this number, the lead-off track, but it switches to a crunchy, up-tempo chug at around the two-minute mark, though, and before letting rip an impressive, fiery, and winding guitar solo section. This then slams into the blistering proto-thrash of \\"Sleepless Nights,\\" which is backed by fiery, thrashy, chug and churn riffs, Judas Priest-y falsetto vocals, and grumbling bass. The tune also uncorks an epic pair of infectiously melodic, sweep-picked solos, too. The album's best solos are found elsewhere, however. For a few examples, check out the deliciously harmonic, prog-approved, and crystalline-soloing found in \\"Lies,\\" an otherwise crunchy and industrial-strength chugger, the fantastic, wonderfully wailing and epic solo in \\"'Amon' Belongs To Them,\\" and the soaring \\"Victimized,\\" which is highlighted once again by a batch of terrific soloing (including one technical, sweeping melodic solo, and one fierier, and more shred-oriented solo.)<br /><br />But those are not the only standouts to be had, here. \\"A Visit From The Dead\\" is one big early highlight in that it opens with a gorgeous string arrangement iced with some melodically humming bass lines and high-pitched clean singing. It eventually segues into heavier, propulsive territory, with chunky, chugging guitars and Megadeth-ian vocals, though. And you know the track has hit its climax by the time a few mazy and jazzily clean solos are slipped into the mix. And its neighbor, \\"The Wedding Dream,\\" is another song that you definitely need to pay attention to. Despite opening with a bizarre organ intro (playing the \\"Here Comes The Bride\\" theme), this cut mostly plays like an early Judas Priest b-side, what with its propulsive speed metal picking, falsetto vocal hooks, and amazing soloing.  Rounding out the album are a couple of ominous interludes (\\"Let It Be Done\\" and the very aptly-entitled instrumental \\"Something Weird\\"), and one longer instrumental piece that serves as the original closing of the album (\\"Cremation,\\" which is basically four-plus minutes of symphonic-sounding guitar harmonies and keyboards.)<br /><br />And if you buy the reissue of \\"Conspiracy\\" (and you definitely should), you will be treated to two cool bonus songs. The Judas Priest-y speed metaller that is \\"At The Graves (Alternate Mix),\\" with its again Rob Halford-worshipping proper singing, crunchy, strong riffing, occasional symphonic flourishes, and stellar soloing (dig the excellent, screaming, piercing solo early on in this seven-and-a-half-minute-long epic) comes first. And it is then followed-up by \\"Cremation (Live Show Mix),\\" an organ and guitar-harmony led set closer. These two songs are both worth tracking down if you don't already own them, as they are both very good inclusions that add much to the album, even if they are just two pieces of incentive for collection junkies to re-buy \\"Conspiracy,\\" one of the finest and most accomplished conceptual heavy metal albums this side of Queensryche's \\"Operation: Mindcrime.\\"e both very good inclusions that add much to the album, even if they are just two pieces of incentive for collection junkies to re-buy \\"Conspiracy,\\" one of the finest and most accomplished conceptual heavy metal albums this side of Queensryche's \\"Operation: Mindcrime.\\"

B001KT6JPA|5.0|This may be an even better film than Silence of the Lambs. Clarice, in all of her vulnerability, comes all too close to Dr. Lecter.  The likenesses that they see in each other play out in the dynamic between them, very sensual and with great energy.  The violence and gore is done very tastefully (!!)  and the ending is to die for.  Julianne Moore captures a side of Clarice that adds to Jodie Foster's version.  Clarice and Hannibal have each grown, but in the same or in different directions??
B0000714BP|5.0|Loved this movie. It is funny & entertaining with good acting. It is one that we have watched more than just once.

0618871713|5.0|The author takes on very difficult issues as she digs into her father's true nature in this autobiography of a family.  She shows these things first from the perspective of a child and later through the perspective of a maturing young adult.  The artwork is engaging and her attitude is one of warmth and searching that makes the reader feel real empathy with the characters in this book. This is not a children's comic book and deals with serious issues, but it is a compelling read and a story told with great compassion through the comic art medium.

Titiana Maslany is simply amazing. Each clone is a separate individual.

0439023491|4.0|If anyone remembers my Hunger Games review from last year, you might recall how I mocked the entire story in one single sitting.  It's not a bad story.  And from what I remember from the book, I did enjoy it for what it was worth.  But to me, it was repetitive and predictable.  I actually enjoyed the movie more (it might have something to do with that foxy Jennifer Lawrence).<br /><br />I promised myself I wouldn't read the second installment of `Hunger Games,' but I couldn't help myself (and I was a little curious how the second film will play out, which is due in theaters this November).<br /><br />Even though Catching Fire is also predictable, and like Hunger Games, lifts/borrows/and steals ideas from other stories - I found myself - actually - really - completely - utterly - thoroughly - deeply - enjoying what I was reading.  To Suzanne Collins credit, she is a damn good writer.  Catching Fire is pieced together well (it's not perfect by any means, and I will get into the issues I had with it soon enough).  On its own merits, it's a better story than its predecessor.  As a sequel, it expands the mythology of its story, heightens the tension, ups the ante times 10, and doesn't play things safe (which is a rarity).  As a second act to a three act story, this is probably at its strongest: the middle act of The Hunger Games saga.<br /><br />Everything that transpired during the time frame of the first Hunger Games, has consequences in the second book.  It's a rarity in a sequel to carry over that theme: consequences.  Usually sequels are nothing more than rehashes of its predecessors, following the formula without a natural flow.<br /><br />Once Katniss defied the Capitol with her little berry incident tail end of the first Hunger Games, she will be marked as an example.  I predicted that right away.  But how the consequences of her actions are felt: I didn't predict.  I expected a more elaborate Hunger Games event, like what was done in the first book, but how it plays out, I didn't predict.  I expected a rebellion of some kind to develop, but how it develops throughout Catching Fire, I didn't expect.  The book surprised me, keeping me enticed and curious what I will read next.<br /><br />What I did expect/predict, and sadly, the book dabs too much in, is the love triangle.  At least 50 (or so) pages are invested to Katniss, wondering what kind of meat would she prefer: chicken or beef.  It got to the point that I was confused if I was reading a Twilight book.<br /><br />\\"Oh my gosh, I think I love Gale.  But I am supposed to be in love with Peeta.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh my gosh, I think I love Peeta.  But I am supposed to be destined with Gale.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh my gosh, I think I am in love.  But I am supposed to live alone without love.\\"<br /><br />I guess because this book is from the perceptive of a 17-year-old girl, indecisive consistency comes with the territory.  But the odds are certainly not in the book's favor as it takes away from the solid integrity.<br /><br />Still, despite the weak love triangle, Catching Fire provides damn good writing, by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />\\"Everything seems to erupt at once. The earth explodes into showers of dirt and plant matter. Trees burst into flames. Even the sky fills with brightly colored blossoms of light. I can't think why the sky's being bombed until I realize the Gamemakers are shooting off fireworks up there, while the real destruction occurs on the ground. Just in case it's not enough fun watching the obliteration of the arena and the remaining tributes. Or perhaps to illuminate our gory ends.\\"<br /><br />\\"Around the Cornucopia, the ground appears to be bleeding; the water has the purple stains. Bodies lie on the ground and float in the sea, but at this distance, everyone dressed exactly the same, I can't tell who lives or dies.\\"<br /><br />\\"Everything is happening too fast for me to process it. The warning, the shootings, the recognition that I may have set something of greatconsequence in motion. The whole thing is so improbable. And it would be one thing if I had planned to stir things up, but given the circumstances...how on earth did I cause so much trouble?\\"<br /><br />\\"We should be safe inside the Justice Building by now, if I hadn't stopped, if I hadn't left my flowers. Instead, from the deep shade of the verandah, we see the whole thing.<br /><br />A pair of Peacekeepers dragging the old man who whistled to the top of the steps. Forcing him to his knees before the crowd. And putting a bullet through his head.\\"<br /><br />And it was at that moment, Suzanne Collins (or, should I say, Katniss Everdeen) pulled me into this dark and gritty futuristic world (that isn't too far from the going-on's of 2013).  Like the first book, Catching Fire is written in such a confrontational way, it breathes as a life on its own.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This story about overcoming some of life's most wicked curveballs and handling them with grace and integrity is very uplifting and inspiring. Although I feel this is a good read for children, there are a lot of things to be learned by people of any age. &#34;Always be kinder than is necessary.&#34; It's such a great feel-good read. Don't pass it up.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I love everything by Neil Gaiman but this book is probably one of my favorites.A beautifully written adult fairy tale. Highly recommended to all who love a good fantasy.

B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I read the reviews about it in comparison to Kanye's album and I'm glad I decided to get this one. I like the fact he actually rapped about something relevant compared to other artists I listen to on the radio. He shouts out New York a lot and as a New Yorker I like that. The samples for the album are fair enough to help you decide what tracks you want. I listened to the album jumping around and I have my favorites:<br /> track 1 Villuminati sampling Juicy from Notorious B.I.G and using lines like &#34;sometimes I brag like Hov&#34; for the hook.<br />track 3 Land of the Snakes which can be applied outside the music industry.<br />track 4 Power Trip featuring Miguel. I think Miguel can guest on anybody's track and make it sound great and he does it on this track.<br />track 16 Born Sinner featuring @Fauntleroy. Short but honest.<br />track 18 New York Times featuring 50 Cent and Bas. My personal favorite. To me this is shouting out N.Y track.<br />All in all good album bringing rap almost back to how it started instead of some of the foolishness I hear now. I think he could've went without some of the cursing but a good album overall. No complaints.

B006Y5H74W|5.0|The talent in this ensemble is amazing. If you liked GLEE, prepare yourself for GLEE pumped up! The quality of the singing and dancing has surpassed anything I have ever seen made for television. But then for Steven Spielberg  to link his name with any project, you just know it has to be good. The people involved in the making of this series know what they are about.  It is tantalizing to glimpse this realistic portrayal of exactly what goes into getting a musical to Broadway. From the first ideas batted about by writers, to the preliminary opening in Boston, we witness the performing arts in action. All the wheeling and dealing behind the scenes, compromising, cheating, game playing, and incredible, in your face talent, as they compete in a world where competition never sleeps is fascinating. The CD of season one is wonderful. This is not a CD where some record producer puts one or two good tracks on a CD, then fills it with songs that  will never be popular. Every song on the Smash CD is a gem. The upbeat songs are just as enjoyable as the ballads. And they are sung with that commitment to project and convey emotion before a live audience, that one only finds in musical theater. Nobody does it better than these Broadway bound hopefuls. I bought the cheaper CD, to see if I would find it enjoyable without the visual performances. Love it. Will definitely be buying the longer version.

B0051OZ564|1.0|What an extremely bad movie. In a word - lame. If you looked up the definition of \\"stinker\\" next to it there would be the film poster to \\"Sucker Punch\\".<br /><br />The only reason I started watching was that Zack Synder, of \\"300\\" fame directed it. I went the length of the film because the computer generated graphics were interesting, not great, just interesting. Also at times I like watching really bad films just to see how far they can go with the outrageously bad plots, poor acting and gratuitous violence. This one went about as far as they could go. This film is proof that Hollywood can't produce decent entertainment. BOOOOO, BOOOOO!!!!<br /><br />I think if 3 winged monkeys flew out of my posterior they could come up with a better plot and more meaningful themes.<br /><br />Don't waste your precious time. And act as responsible adults and don't let your teens watch this, it will rot their brains. I repeat, BOOOOO, BOOOOO!!!!<br /><br />Attention parents of teenage girls: I forgot to mention the appalling sexual exploitation of women in this film. The \\"young\\" female characters of this film are either working in a whorehouse or are being held in some kind of captivity by brutal men. Nice, huh? This might get the hormones flowing of adolencent male viewers - as Hollywood intended - but they aren't role models for your little girls.<br /><br />For that I add an extra, BOOOOOO, BOOOOOO, BOOOOOO!!!

First of all, the suspense is so heavy all the way through, and Jennifer Lawrence does an awesome job portraying that. Secondly, it is such a great satire about society. Thirdly, this was one movie that was actually as good as the book. I cannot wait for the rest of the movies.

B005LAIH2C|2.0|the time is old world setting,but the people talk<br />and act like people today, 16 bucks and two hours<br />of my life gone...time would of been better spent if i<br />stared at the wall...
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|I couldn't watch it, too much fake emotion. It was unbearable, not that the acting was bad, but the whole movie was came off as a forced attempt to pull at its viewers emotions. lame.
B003UYV08E|5.0|This is an enjoyable continuation to one of my favorite super hero films.<br /><br />Heavy on Stark, with some strong action sequences and good looking women.<br /><br />I would recommend this to people of all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A good game, addictive and fun to play against friends. I recommend this to anyone who likes temple run! It's only slightly different but better still.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Couldn't stop reading this book.  Finished it in two days.  Great read would recommend.  Looking to read more from this author
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's so different than any book that I've ever read. It's very captivating , I couldn't put it down .

B002JIEYKS|5.0|I was a 10th grader when this came out, always liked the album soon as I get more cash going to buy this import I was living in Europe in '79 the import is a better recording. Anyway this and Eternal Idol are my fav. Blk. Sabby. LP's. Get'hum dude's their cool man. Thanks A Mill.

030758836X|3.0|Young marrieds Nick and Amy Dunne are in trouble. Like so many people today, they find themselves bogged down in the mire of today's rotten economy, their jobs (magazine journalist and Cosmo quiz-writer respectively) made obsolete by the Internet. Due to money troubles and general incompatibility, their five-year-old marriage has crumbled, leaving them locked in a hateful, claustrophobic relationship. Then, on the day of their anniversary, Nick returns home to find Amy missing. When police find trace amounts of blood in the kitchen, they begin to suspect that Nick is the culprit. Is Nick being framed, or is he truly responsible for a horrible crime? By examining both past and present, Gone Girl traces the ugly meltdown of a marriage, and the terrible consequences it brings.<br /><br />Although I won't hesitate to proclaim Gone Girl to be a tense psychological thriller and an excellent choice for airport reading or beach trips, I have to admit that I had mixed feelings about the novel as a whole. Like the 1989 Michael Douglas movie, War of the Roses (which details the worst divorce battle in history), Gone Girl focuses on the absolute worst aspects of two fairly unlikeable people. While I must applaud Flynn for going against the grain in this aspect, I can't think of two characters I would rather NOT read about ever again. The reader will either delight in Nick and Amy's despicable natures or want them both to die horrible deaths. It's one of those books that makes you glad that you read it (just to see what the fuss was about), but also equally glad when you finish it and move on to something prettier.
B0089LOG02|4.0|As the story unfolds it becomes increasingly difficult to put the book down as it captures the similarities between a past and present era.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|this is a great book.It relates to real life events and tells of the struggles with in.One time i actually cried for the moment where she tells buttercup that prim is gone and that she isn't ever coming back.This is not a make believe book,this is what real life is like.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Great movie, worth the watch.  A picture of how one boys dream, one mans kindest, one womens direction could bring out the best in man.  It shows the highest of man's value system.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|In essence, Elysium is an allegory on our society that pinpoints a few harsh realities.<br /><br />It is one of the latest big budget movies that try to hit \\"the poor versus the rich\\" nail on the head: The fact that the gap between the social classes has been continually growing over the years is common knowledge. More alarming and lesser known fact is that the number of billionaires has increased in the first decade of the 21st century at an unprecedented rate. Elysium cunningly mirrors what current trends may lead to in a grim and merciless yet plausible future. Throughout the film one realizes we are already living in that future.<br /><br />Elysium is simply a heaven and a haven for billionaires. Set in space, in proximity to earth, it is a state of the art space station that inhabits only the richest of the rich in five stars living conditions, whereas the rest of humanity lives on earth, poorer and more miserable than ever.<br />The film deals with the dreams and efforts of the poor to reach Elysium to get better life and access magical medical treatment device that can cure all diseases and prolong life expectancy.<br /><br />Our protagonist, Max (Matt Damon), has always wanted to reach Elysium. Unfortunately as an adult he has to get there to save his own life, after absorbing a lethal dosage of radiation in an exploitative sweatshop-like factory owned and managed by one the above mentioned billionaires. The price of obtaining a ticket up is engaging in a highly violent and deadly mission to capture and deliver information that same billionaire possesses. It turns out that this information may be the key to miraculously change the harsh reality for everybody for good...<br /><br />In all, recommended mostly for the Sci-Fi and action fans that can appreciate sharp social criticism.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Move over Pixar, Illumination is moving on up.  i don't watch too many movies more than once but I will watch this movie for years to come.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|enjoyed this game. Not too challenging for me. jJust enough so I didn't get bored, but not so hard that I quit in frustration. Hope more levels are coming
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie was awesome. Even if you have never followed along with the characters, like me. My kids point out this is so-n-so or such-n-such and watching it becomes fun.. I found myself rutting for the good guys and booing for the bad ones as the story progressed... Well done movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game and going thru the levels arriving at different cities. Game starts slow then speeds up as you go along. That's when the fun begins
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|EASY to learn to play  but oh so difficult to master!  I've spent many more hours playing this game than I would have originally guessed!
B008P9M614|5.0|Its the best, I can watch house whenever I want now.  And it was a great deal.  You'll love it.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I didn't expect to like this movie but was pleasantly surprised! Great action. Nice effects.  I  was on the edge of my seat.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I thought I knew everything there was to know about the assasination of President John F. Kennedy. However, this book had no shortage of surprises. I have to give Stephen King credit - he really did his research. I also found that the past truly came alive through this book. It seems that Jake Epping is pulled into this world with a vengeance, and at first has no idea what's happening to him. Once he finds out what his mission is, he jumps into the past wholeheartedly. And once I got into the book, I did too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a work out ! It is like temple run or temple run 2 or oz temple run or even brave temple run

B000F2C87Q|5.0|Great album. In the style of Junior Kimbrough. The album is a little short though. Only 6 songs. Only 30(ish) minutes long.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's just like the real thing! It's lots of fun, reminds me of when I used to play it when I was a kid
B007REV4T8|3.0|Do people realize this is a retread of the villain from Goldeneye(ex MI6 agent goes rouge)? Only thing is they made him a bit gay. Dark Knight came out first,  and after a while this movie starts to feel like the Dark Knight. This really feels like a reboot for the series, the evil Quantum organization from the first two films is left behind. We get a cool new M and some other familiar Bond characters show up. This is a good Bond movie, but pretty overrated. I think people are falling in love with the wonderful cinematography because the story is pretty flat. The list of covert agents(the noc list from MI), the villian allows himself to be captured(the joker from Dark Knight), (squeezed in a gay villian....yawn Diamonds are forever)...is there anything original about this plot? Great chemistry between Craig and Deinch...But overall we have an overrated film.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a newer extra tv in one of my rooms and my wife loves to watch Netflix when she is in that room. It is a basic HD TV, no smart TV. I was racking my brain on how to get Netflix on it. My wifes tablet didn't have an HDMI out, mine did, but then I couldn't use it when she was. And then Chromecast was announced. It works as advertised. Streaming is clear and precise. It was very easy to setup. I think Google has something here. And when they start accepting apps from 3 party developers who knows where it will go.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This app is Pretty cool! I've tried a bunch, but I like this the best. It's easy to use and looks really good.

B00C04H2VO|5.0|The reason I bought this set, as you guys know, is because of the &#34;bananas&#34; ! Even I wish they put more &#34;bananas&#34; in the set, but, overall, they all very good and quality is also pretty good. I have the bananas in my car, and they look awesome!

B001HC8516|5.0|This book said everything I have ever needed to hear. Very interesting as well as inspiring. Im going to give a copy to all of my girlfriends.
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought this because a friend said it's a really good read.  I was told it was a little erotic, but that's not why she liked it.  She said it was a fascinating story.  The premise is ok.  I did not buy it for an erotic tale, I bought it because she said it was an interesting story line.  The story might be interesting, but I can't get over the writing style.  I hate how E L James writes!  The dialogue and the inner monologues are incredibly annoying.  In order for a book to be good to me it has to have a good story, interesting character development and a style and flow that doesn't distract from the story.  The style and flow in this book is so awful I can't get into the story and I don't find the characters very developed.  If you just want to read the erotic scenes, that's fine, read this book, you might enjoy it if you're into the kind of &#34;intimacy&#34; that happens in this story.  Don't bother if you actually want something good to read.
B004XD03RK|5.0|Death's Human may just be one of the best pieces ever recorded in the history of metal. In fact it is a classic. It equals Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\" Ritchie Blackmore's \\"Rainbow\\" the best albums of the NWOBHM, the best albums of the Big Four, in terms of influence, ingenuity, and overall technical ability for Schuldiner and company. While the riffs and solos are flat out great, the bass being semi audible in parts...the real highlight of this album is Mr. Reinert's drumming. Insane, intense, and powerful, he propels this album from zero to lightspeed in three seconds. The lyrics in Human are some of the best in the entire discography of Death. Gone are the days of gore and smut (although I did like their older material) Death takes a more mature outlook on the trails and tribulations of just being human. These fellas had managed to pull death metal into a somewhat accessible reach by combining melody with brutal riffs and of course, Chuck's infamous vocals.<br /><br />Overall, in the genre that is metal, so few bands make it to the top. Even fewer bands will release an album of this caliber, this genre defining masterpiece holds a special place to my heart and makes me incredible happy to be a \\"Human\\" (pun intended) a must have in a metal collection.

B0012TWRAO|5.0|I'm using the large bracket with the insert piece. Not entirely sure; the smaller one without the insert may work but the smaller surface area of just the bracket doesn't look right to me. That said, this piece is real solid and completely reliable. Two thumbs up.
B00123G51C|5.0|When the Quartet ended after their past concert at the Pittsburgh Hilton Ballroom on December 26, 1967 a lot of fans (including myself) thought something magic was irretrievably lost. How wrong!<br /><br />The music has been hashed to death in other reviews, many of which did an excellent job of describing the tracks. Those reviews probably predated the inclusion of the sound samples on this page, so use those as a guide. Granted, this album is relatively short only topping three quarters of an hour, but the music will linger in your mind after each playing.<br /><br />While the classic Quartet featuring Gene Wright on bass and Joe Morello was hard to top I have to admit that Jack Stix and Alan Dawson come close. What is important is Paul Desmond, whom I've always considered to be the soul of every incarnation of the Quartet, is present and in great form. And Dave is simply superb. Gerry Mulligan is no stranger to either Dave or Paul - right after the Quartet broke up he was playing with Dave in May of 68, and did numerous collaborations with Paul. In fact some of both Mulligan's and Desmond's best albums in my opinion are collaborations between the two. I rank them as two geniuses of Eb instruments. I would have loved it had Gerry participated on track 3, Kyoto Song, but he sat that one out.<br /><br />Some discographies erroneously cite this entire album being recorded at the L'Olympia in Paris on October 26, 1972. The only track recorded there and on that date was Kyoto Song. Tracks 1, 2 and 4 were recorded at the Philharmonie in Berlin on November 4, 1972, and the remaining tracks at De Doelen in Rotterdam on October 28, 1972 (Dave is solo on track 6).

B009R54MGW|5.0|I am a huge Phillipa Gregory fan and have loved all of her books but this was outstanding.  It is based on the story of a little known Queen who had a turbulent childhood and a difficult marriage.  I thought that the characters were very well developed and you saw the contradictions and conflicts that appear in marriages highlighted in a very interesting way.  The characters are portrayed as having torn loyalties and it is fascinating to see the ways in which they try to manage those conflicts.  This is an old story but at the same time it is a contemporary story because we see people struggling to do the right thing morally but at the same time wanting to make pragmatic decisions.
B0098XY5VK|1.0|I first I thought It was pretty cool but u only get one level and u unlock it but u have to pay for it but I guess it gets better but this game should have more levels
0316789704|5.0|I got these books for my two girls, age 6 and 4. They love to draw but had kind of hit a wall when it came to ideas, and so I bought this book to inspire them, and teach them. Within minutes, the four year old drew the blue cat face on the cover, and they were both taking turns browsing through this and another Ed Emberley book we purchased. This is worth the money, and I really like drawing the things in the book, too!

B00B2166BS|5.0|I don't have charging times and percentages or side by side comparisons like other reviews I have read.  All I can say is this cord is a must.  With the charging cable that came with my Nexus 10 I was not able to charge and watch a video after my device had gotten below 10% charge as I knew the cable couldn't keep up and eventually my Nexus 10 would shut down.  This had me choosing on several occasions to not even use my tablet but instead let it charge while powered off.  Not anymore!  With this cable I am able to do anything no matter how low the charge and as long as it is plugged into the pogo charger I will be fine.  As we speak I am down to 5% but instead of scrambling for the stock charging cable before my tablet hits the point of no return I will continue writing this review as I know the pogo will keep it alive and charging even if I plug it in at 1%.  Why does this not come with the tablet to begin with?  It is infuriating how many time I couldn't use my tablet which was very very expensive due to the poor charging cable it is shipped with.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|lots of content - even more than a paid game<br /><br />nice seek / find type of game. Lots of scenes. I was able to pass about 3 or 4 hours completing all the scenes.<br /><br />highly reccomend

B0044WSGXI|3.0|My wife had never seen American Graffiti before so we decided to download it from Amazon out of convenience. This was our 1st Amazon movie rental but the rental process went pretty smoothly. Download was relatively fast (Verizon FIOS) and picture quality was above average. The audio quality, however, was very poor. I've watch this movie before on regular cable/sat TV and had no issues w/ audio or video quality.<br /><br />The movie itself was a hit w/ the wife after I explained parts to her that were distorted due to the audio quality.<br /><br />Movie is a 4.5 star flick but had to ding it a couple stars for the audio quality

B008C20TDG|4.0|My daughter and her husband did the Whole 30 for the required month and really benefitted from it.  I read the book and it was quite interesting, but at my age it was more than I was willing to do.  I read the Wheat Belly by Dr. Davis and found that to be more in line with our way of eating, but still getting rid of the harmful foods and ingredients we were eating.

Seriously one of the sweetest sights!.  Perfect for not having pacifiers spit out and dropped in unsanitary places. Small enough for the littlest of babies but enough  to grow with. I will definitely be buying an assortment of these when my day comes to be a mother. :)

B00BTHWFEC|2.0|Okay, I'm not one of these audiophiles that gets a new piece of music just so they can run it through some software and then complain about '\\"brickwalling\\" etc in fact I don't consider myself an audiophile at all. I wasn't looking to notice the subtle sonic qualities (or lack thereof) of this recording and to be honest, I was so excited about the content of the music that it took me quite a while to notice anything was amiss, or maybe it just took me a while to get around to listening with my headphones on...<br />So yeah, the music is good, some of it is great in fact, songs like \\"Damaged Soul\\" almost made me weep for joy because they were such a return to form and I think the album is WELL worth buying. I bought the vinyl AND the Best Buy Deluxe edition so I'm not here to turn anyone off from buying what is Sabbath's finest release since Dehumanizer.<br />No, I'm here to complain about what was done to the recording itself. Recordings these days, in the eyes of the \\"powers that be\\" HAVE to be kind of loud in order to go up against other stuff that gets played on the radio and people's mp3 players. I get that, I don't like it but I get it. But this is SO loud that you can actually hear pieces of the music \\"clipping out\\" which is to say it's so \\"hot\\" in the mix that it reaches a point of distortion and I don't know lack of \\"being\\" even cymbal crashes don't ring out they just die off quickly it's ridiculous!! And it's the same on CD as it is on vinyl, anybody that tells you different is just wrong. The vinyl sounds exactly like the CD in that regard. I put on the vinyl remaster of Mob Rules after 13 and it sounded so much better it was unbelievable. That is an absolute crime to think this recording would have sounded better using 30 year old technology but it's true. Don't believe me? Try it.

B000J1AGQI|2.0|Should have been called \\"When We Were Stupid\\"<br /><br />Basically a re-telling of a true battle from the beginnings of the war in 65, but with much borrowed from Dien Bien Phu, this was an utterly wasted opportunity to tell part of the tragedy of Vietnam.<br /><br />The first hour is thoroughly awful, showing the domestic bliss of the soldiers, most of whom are indistinguishable from each other, especially when compared to the sharply drawn characters of Platoon. Later, when they die, you don't care.<br /><br />The battle sequences are very realistic and gory, but so confusingly shot that it all flattens out. Yes war is chaos, but editing shouldn't be. The director is in way over his head. If a soldier gets a line of dialogue, he is pretty much dead within a couple of beats. It's so predictable.<br /><br />The writer needed a director, and the director needed a writer. Unfortunately, they were both the same guy, Randall Wallace, the guy who wrote Braveheart. Should have known his limitations. The script is brutal. With such good source material, how is that possible?<br /><br />Gibson is decent as the naif colonel, the victim of a totally unedited script (notwithstanding an American accent that wanders constantly).<br /><br />Two more points that are the responsibility of the producers and director collectively.<br /><br />The story is set in the central highlands of Vietnam, not the jungles we are used to from many other Vietnam films. The problem, as historically accurate as this may be, the location looks like Griffith park. It's impossible to imagine the soldiers in peril in this setting. Nobody noticed this (or perhaps the stones to mention it) but it really hurts the film.<br /><br />The film focuses on over-selling the courage of the soldiers, which no one is contesting. Cutting back and forth to the VietCong point of view is one of the more successful devices. But the tragedy, which is where the story is, is in the soldiers being sent into indefensible terrain, and surrounded, then, after hundreds of deaths, they realize \\"Oh! We can bomb the crap out of the surrounding mountains and kill all the Charlies that way!\\"<br /><br />The whole battle was conducted backwards, and the interesting story is of the idiots back in Saigon or wherever who planned the mission, or once they realized they were up against a much larger enemy force than they anticipated, no one made any tactical adjustments.<br /><br />The behavior of some of the soldiers is just so dumb. Yeah it was the beginning of Vietnam and we had much to learn, but trust me, anyone whose seen three cowboy and indian movies knows you don't take your whole platoon running after one guy, shouting all the while \\"get him!\\" \\"get him!\\" My kid knew it was a trap.<br /><br />I liked Braveheart, overwrought as it was, but this is a mess. Wallace needed to quit while he was ahead. Not recommended.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|gave a very beliveable glimpse into what a future division of haves and have nots could lead to if we do nothing to bring people together.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Gripping drama, good acting, something we look forward to each night. Thank you for providing this &#34;free&#34; to Prime Members.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am addicted to the game and like the challenge of beating my highest score posted at the end of each game. However, bypassing the ads at the beginning of each game does get annoying.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book....couldn't put it down...captivating from beginning till end. This novel gives a new spin on a fathers' love for his child.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn novel, it kept my attention, had some nice twists and a very cool ending
B000URI8YS|5.0|I love this movie and was disappointed that they didn't make a 3rd one. The gals have great chemistry and while the storyline is a bit corny it's a lot of fun.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This was a great transaction. I recommend this merchant. Great service and great prices. My son LOVES the Wreck-it-Ralph video. You don't always have to pay more for great service.
0307352153|2.0|4 stars for content, however the quality of the binding on my copy is appalling. Almost every page is falling out. I would have returned this book had I not waited a couple of months before reading it (and hence missing out on the 30 day return policy).
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I think WOTE is incredibly creative.  They are all amazing musicians.  I hope they meet all the success they want.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Love Dame Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.  The story was so true and I<br />found it to be pretty actual.  The scenes in India were a little &#34;prettied&#34; up for<br />the movie but you centerenly get the feeling of overcrowding. I think overall<br />it was a good &#34;summer&#34; movie
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Is a little expensive but very entertaining the extra characters should be made available for flu credits please do this for us
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|A bit too predictable. Good read if you are looking for something light. The romance was a little far fetched--no cop would get involved with a suspect in a murder investigation and keep his job for very long.
B0094ZJ7HO|4.0|Alot of these songs remind me of their earlier works which is why I presonally fell in love with them, namely their first album. They seem to keep getting more bubblegummy with each new release but this is a good change of pace. Then again most B-side releases are better. See Pisces Iscariot from The Smashing Pumpkins. Easily their best album ever. This one from elbow ranks in the top three for me.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The unit works as expected, without outstanding results, but worth the price. Good choice if you dont need professional results.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard and definitely too short but still makes you think. Hoping they will add more levels very soon.
B001NHNG64|3.0|It felt like it dragged in the middle but overall was an okay book. I was happy with the ending.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A wonderful trip through history of the time that Jesus walked the earth. Also an in depth look at those who wrote the gospels and help form a new religion.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|WOW!  I am sorry that it was too complex for the general movie going crowd but - OH MY GOSH -- it is a fantastic work of art.  If you want to see an absolutely amazing tour-de-force from Tom Hanks, Hallie Barrie, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon and a number of less well known but exquisitely talented actors - this is it.  The Warshowski brothers have peaked on this one.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|The \\"untouchables\\" touched me. The strong, pure relationship between these two men, the simple selflessness of the caretaker who rises from lowly beginnings...the passion for life that they shared...it was wonderful to watch.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Sorry to see Emma Thompson in this one -- not her best-- the film was rather boring, sappy and contrived.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|this is an awesome movie. I loved it. it is the right movie for you if you like ross lynch and maia Mitchell.
0880796863|4.0|this will do the trick.  It is a classic.  I like the images and the colors even though this is not fine printing.
B0060D2QR6|5.0|loved it. you should get it. if you like miley cyrus and liam hensworth then it is a good movie for you.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I received my copy quickly and in good condition.....I haven't watch it yet, but will venture to guess it will be in great condition. Thanks.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Like the upgrade, lots of detailed info.  Super easy to navigate.<br />Videos are clear and up to date! No problems, just don't know what else to say.
B0002S947K|5.0|No words can describe his amazing voice and music...Beautiful comes close.....Received quickly and in great condition...Thank you so very much .
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|The Withings Pulse is a great activity tracker.  I can easily monitor my activities on my iPhone.  Transferring the data is quick and convenient.  The Pulse is so small that it can be placed almost anywhere with convenience.<br />We also use the Withing wireless scale so it's a one-database health and activity monitoring system.  Really like it.

1601251831|4.0|I'm very satisfied with this book, a good value, great condition, and I have used it a lot already. Nuff said.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Great graphics, perfect and smooth gameplay, simple controls, and my only complaint is I wish they would add more levels.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is super fun and amazing it feels like u are really there riding. the horse's are so. cute and friendly
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really love this game it is awesome! I hope they have many more chapters too come! This kind of games keep you thinking a d they are not boring by any means
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good for relaxation. Sometimes it does seem too easy, but then it goes back to being challenging. I alternate between playing the and euchre.
159463176X|5.0|The Book was in perfect condition, the price was right and I got it very quickly. Win, win deal...Highly recommend!
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This is an amazing and inspirational story! A great movie to watch with the family. I highly recommend it to people of all ages!
B007US9NA8|5.0|The title says it all, but even that does not do it justice. I first bought this book around 96' or 97'. It's a game changer for sure. The only drawback to that book was its size. Moving/deploying, it's not the easiest book to carry around, but now that I have the Kindle edition, problem solved.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any man between the ages of 12 - 100. Better yet, every man should own this book. This book covers everything you need to know.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After reading the first Hunger Games book, I was expecting a very entertaining second book and i was not disappointed. I found Catching Fire to be the best book in the series. I would definitely recommend it .
0470901071|4.0|I am on chapter three and I feel the author does a good job of explaining complex issues by breaking it down into smaller areas and then putting it together so you understand the bigger picture.<br /><br />I have been working in IT for a few years, mainly as a desktop administrator, but have now moved into a position as a network engineer.  So far this book has been a real asset.  Only reason i am giving it four stars is because I wish there was an electronic copy that came with the book.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|GREAT MOVIE, BIG ACTORS.  THE KID IS A GREAT ACTOR.  FUN STORY.  ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH  WORTH THE FEW DOLLARS IT COSTS TO RENT
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I Really enjoyed this one.  A must read. Much better than the movie. Loved the characters and especially loved the ending.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My grandson told me it was the best book he had ever read.  So naturally I had to read The Book Thief.  He was right.  The book is very intriguing and interesting and hard to put down!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ok I love this app it's so fun and u get to get more horses along the way and u also get to compete in compatitions and its just so fun and u get to play games and get gems and as u get more horses there is a zebra and its so beautiful I love this app and if u get this one app it shows u how to groom your horse and witch brush is witch :) if u have kik kik me
B000V6738U|4.0|I REALLY liked about half the songs, the others were good listening, but not as memorable. They want 4 more words, so here's a few extra...sheeese!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Extrapolation basis: I like: Alien, 2001, The Matrix, Dark Star, Terminator, Trigun...<br /><br />Unlike most movies advertised as sci-fi, Oblivion is a genuine science-fiction story in movie form. As opposed to such staples as the war movie (with aliens), the horror movie (with aliens), or the western (with ray guns).  Unfortunately I personally didn't find any of the characters really engaging, and the plot holes were impossible to ignore while watching it (and they multiply every time I think about it).  So as story-driven sci-fi I would give it only three stars, but I give it another star for its beautiful & constructive use of CGI, landscape, architecture and equipment.  If Ikea made sci-fi movies, they might look like this.  Uh... except for the costuming of the scavengers: Cliche, ugly AND implausible, and they double down on this mistake with a lame explanation in-movie.<br /><br />My thought as the ending credits rolled was that Oblivion is a sci-fi short story, or at most a novella, trying to support a large-screen full-length movie, and it just doesn't have the lifting power for that job. \\"Moon\\" in some ways works the same territory but seems better scaled to its material.  Nonetheless, if you like science fiction, Oblivion an enjoyable 2 hours of very nice looking science-fictiony stuff happening on screen.<br /><br />I expect \\"Are you an effective team?\\" to be an office joke among nerds for a while.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent series, I can not wait for season four to come out in October.  Highly recommend the series to anyone.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Star Wars is a space soap opera about a farm boy (Luke Skywalker) who meets a motley crew of characters (Han Solo, Princess Leia) before battling the evil empire personified (Darth Vader). The Star Wars saga is so iconic the story need not be discussed here.<br /><br />Admittedly this set (like almost all Star Wars releases) has problems because George Lucas has changed many of the effects and scenes much to the detriment of fans of the original films. The original trilogy is not the original unaltered versions (where Han shot first) yet the transfers do look gorgeous. Even with an astounding 40 hours of extras (8 hours is brand new) I am disappointed we don't get the original theatrical releases that have never been released on BD or DVD. One benefit of the changes is CGI Yoda. There is some new content for BR. One of the new features is the Star Wars Archives (IV-VI) which includes deleted/extended/alternate scenes supplementary interviews with cast and crew and other featurettes. There are 3 bonus discs crammed with extras from SW: The Prequel Trilogy (Episodes I-III) [BD] and SW: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV-VI) [BD]. However, it does not include all the old content from previous DVD releases such as &#34;Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy&#34; and the 3 featurettes: The Legendary Creatures of Star Wars, The Birth of the Lightsaber, The Legacy of Star Wars on that release. So hang onto that old bonus disc with 236 minutes of content.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Star Wars Documentaries: NEW! Star Warriors (2007, Color, Apx. 84 Minutes)<br />NEW!

Shop around to get the price and Star Wars release that you want (there are many available). We aren't getting an uncut Star Wars in Lucas's lifetime and this collection has managed to hold its value. This saga comes loaded with special features and the films look and sound great (though the original trilogy gets the old 2004 transfers). Diehard fans may be interested in 1984's The Ewok Adventure and 1985's Ewoks: Battle for Endor.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've loved all  the books in this trilogy. This one by far took me for a whirlwind, so unexpectedly with events of up and down. Great book and hopefully a great movie
B0013FBS20|4.0|As a huge fan of Richard Matheson's famous novella, I Am Legend, this film sticks closer to the original material than the previous I Am Legend film adaptations (starring Vincent Price in one and Charlton Heston in the other). The book and film are about Dr. Neville (who also works for the government) believing himself to be the lone survivor after a worldwide catastrophe. Like many end-of-the-world themes Neville finds others while fighting off the dead who have risen again. The book is still regarded as one of the Top 3 vampire/zombie stories of all time. This film depicts the zombies as fairly brainless but they are chillingly effective. Will Smith does a good job of portraying the flawed hero who struggles to keep his spirits up. I have known people who shrink away at some of the zombie scenes in this movie. The special effects work well and don't dominate the story. If you like end of the world themes and zombies (e.g. 28 Days Later) then this will be a great flick.<br /><br />The view of a deserted New York looks great, Will Smith can carry the whole movie easily on his shoulders (there are few survivors after all), and this is likely the best version available of the original novel. The other film versions are great in their own way but have dated costumes and effects. If you like this film then see The Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth which are the earlier adaptations of I Am Legend. The only downsides are that zombies age quickly (seen Night of the Living Dead lately?) and this film is no exception. Also, the dark ending turns some people off (love it).<br /><br />The picture and audio quality are superb. There are 94-minutes of special features included on the Blu-Ray: Creating I Am Legend, Cautionary Tale: The Science of I Am Legend and 4 animated comics: Death as a Gift, Isolation, Sacrificing the Few for the Many, Shelter.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/VC-1; 1080p/480i/VC-1 (Supplements Only)   Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1<br />Audio Formats: English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround (48kHz/16-bit), English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps), French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps), Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps)<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French Subtitles, Spanish Subtitles<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.ish Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround (48kHz/16-bit), English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps), French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps), Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps)<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French Subtitles, Spanish Subtitles<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|The CD is awesome. Just wish it had the song DARK SIDE. Otherwise, the CD IS AWESOME. I wouldn't hesistate to purchase from this site.
B00007KQA3|3.0|I would say this is my favorite version of George Orwell's amazing novel 1984. 4 reasons: 1) John Hurt 2) great soundtrack from Eurythmics, 3) it was Richard Burton's final feature film and 4) it was filmed in the exact time and setting as George Orwell imagined it in his novel (1984 England). 1984 is about a government worker in the future who yearns for freedom. He meets a woman along the way but is under constant surveillance in this frightening police-state setting with class systems, war, starvation and other maladies pushing humans to the edge. The film is very faithful to the novel, effective at creating mood, very interesting and relevant to today's society. If you like the book I think you will be stunned by the overwhelmingly moody, dark and depressing visuals complemented by great performances from everyone. In other words, they captured the theme perfectly in the film. This is not a feel good movie. It's a powerful, captivating and shocking film. Some may consider it an intellectual version of Saw.<br /><br />My only complaints are the VHS release had more music from the Eurythmics that seems to be removed on the digital releases but otherwise it is complete. Also, no extras or special features are provided. That's a damn shame for such an iconic book and film! There is also an older 1956 version of 1984 that is equally devoid of extras. I would be willing to rate it 5 stars otherwise because a bare bones release of this classic doesn't do it justice. Alas there has never been a deluxe release of this film. A Blu-ray loaded with hours of special features, a making of documentary and music options would be terrific.<br /><br />Buy this film. I rate the film 5 stars but this product gets only 3 stars because of the lack of soundtrack options and no special features. The DVD has retained its value quite well.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|When I heard about the Chromecast dongle and the Netflix deal (which is no longer available due to initial demand), I readily hopped on, bought my device from the Google Play store and received my Netflix code for 3 months.  This made it a no-brainer for me.  As an owner of a Roku device, I knew there was going to be some overlap for services but I wanted to try it anyway.  Truly, for the most part (besides some stability issues with my Nexus 4) I have been nothing but impressed.<br /><br />I am streaming multiple ways from different devices:<br /><br />1) [[ASIN:B00D94JERY Google White Nexus 4 Phone Limited Edition 8gb - Unlocked]] running Android's latest OS Jellybean 4.3<br />2) [[ASIN:B00BQH8UEY Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 (16GB, White)]]<br />3) Macbook Pro 13\\" running Mountain Lion<br /><br />Out of all of my devices, I prefer to run Chromecast from my Galaxy tablet as this appears to be the most stable.  The picture quality is excellent and with our current Internet connection (which is fast at 50 up and 5 down), streaming does not seem to run into many delays.  It's fun to watch YouTube on a larger screen through this device.  Currently it only supports Netflix, YouTube and Google movies.  But Hulu, Vimeo and Instant RedBox are in the process of getting onboard with Chromcast.  One of the coolest features about this device is that once your start streaming, you are free to use your device any way you want to.  Once the stream is going you can check email, surf the web, etc .... the cast is already happening and is taking place in the background.  This technology kind of blows my mind.  :-)<br /><br />Set up is a breeze with guidance and good feedback through the entire process.  In under 5 minutes, you can be ready to roll with this device.<br /><br />Besides the stability with Nexus 4 (the Nexus 4 is crashing / shutting down during streaming) this thing is very cool and very handy.  The stability with Nexus is being addressed (interesting that it is a Google phone with stability problems - grin).  The problem really appears to be this: Putting some Android 4.3 devices to sleep while using Netflix causes freezing.  So I don't think I can blame Chromecast - seems to be a combo of Netflix and 4.3.<br /><br />4 stars only because of the Nexus 4 (Jelly Bean 4.3) issue.one with stability problems - grin).

B0001VTPWM|2.0|This review is for the MGM DVD release (for info on the Blu-Ray please skip to the last paragraph) which is the best and most complete set released for the trilogy. The MGM DVD comes with some extras and contains the unrated cut of Robocop. Special Features include: 4 deleted scenes, Flesh and Steel (Making of Robocop) featurette, Shooting Robocop featurette, another Making Robocop featurette, audio commentary, storyboard with commentary, photo gallery, 2 original theatrical trailers, TV Spot. Robocop is 103-minutes (Unrated Version), Robocop 2 is 117-minutes (R) and Robocop 3 is 105 minutes (PG-13). The MGM DVD version is worth tracking down. If you aren't interested in the sequels the advantage here is the unrated Robocop and 53 minutes of featurettes and other bonuses for the original that are absent from the BR release.<br /><br />While I would give the movies 4 stars I am disappointed at the light treatment the Robocop film franchise has received. This is one of the most bland box sets ever produced (DVD or BD) when they could have at least tried to focus on the sequels. Robocop got a Criterion DVD release but it was an average release at best. Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 don't have special features other than trailers so they shouldn't be here. Less than one hour of special features for 3 films doesn't cut it. There is plenty of Robocop footage in the vault. The BD or DVD has no feature-length documentary to tie the entire franchise together. If you only want the original Robocop then buy the Criterion DVD. Avoid the even more disappointing bare-bones Blu-Ray Trilogy release that contains none of the extras on the DVD set.
0374275637|4.0|I have been impressed how challenging a read this book is, but in many ways it is simply engaging.  My attention hardly ever wandered, and I don't think I ever dozed off, even tho I read late at night.
B002UD56I6|3.0|This Is It is a collection of clips from the summer of 2009 just before Michael Jackson passed. He was in the midst of rehearsals for a tour which became the basis of this film. Some clips show MJ rehearsing with the other performers. While I did enjoy watching this film in theaters I was expecting a little more. It was somewhat rough and in need of a good polish. The performances were OK. There are no special features on this disc. This isn't the only way to remember MJ. Check out MJ's video collections to see him at his best as an artist. Also see Michael Jackson's Vision (sold separately) which isn't perfect but it is the most complete collection available.
B001G7G5U0|5.0|Far exceeded my expectations.  I had heard about five minutes of the selection on MPR, checked their playlist and purchased the music.  I've listened to it many times.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|If you like sci-fi, watch this movie.  Fantastic and original premise, plot, and ending.  Those who give it a low review should stick to other genres.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I have no idea what I just watched. This movie is boring and Tom Cruise is terrible in it. The movie made no sense. Is there a colony on Titan?
0345472322|5.0|Excellent book for anyone interested in helping others and themselves get the most out of their potential.  Dweck gives the reader very important reminders about how to think about situations in their life so that they can learn from them and not be stifled by challenges.  I also really liked the real world examples of people (Michael Jordan, John McEnroe, etc) with growth vs. fixed mindsets.  These excerpts made the book a much easier read.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|Good cd from the band,it just seems it lacks the power like the older Sabbath, Ozzie lacks the voice like the older Sabbath,I expected it to be a little heavier,darker,but over all there are some good songs,it is still worth adding to the Sabbath collection.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Action packed adventure with many of my favorite superheroes.  Downey Jr. Is always entertaining as Iron Man, and I really liked Thor.  There was enough plot and character interaction to make it much better than the action packed destruction of the Transformer movies.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  It was a great read.  Touching reunion story and a story of success on both pilots part.  Recommend highly.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I used Immersion Reading with the book and felt as Jane was talking to me directly.  I'd only seen the movie prior to my reading this and was elated with the author's way of talking to the Reader.  I urge everyone to read or re-read the classics and this would be a great choice to begin that process.  Read it and let your mind's eye envision the period dress and aged estates as detailed Bronte.  It's a great read.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|The movie was long.  I found it didn't hold my interest unless The Joker was on the screen. Fans of Batman will love this but it seemed pretty dull more often than I expected it to be. It was still a decent way to kill time but this story could have been told just as well with 30 minutes cut out of it.
B00000DHTF|5.0|This is a great box set.  I consider myself a casual fan.  Most \\"rarities and unreleased\\" type box sets usually are not that good but this one is great!  Some of the songs, it makes me think they should have been on the albums they are so good.  I probably enjoy disc 3 the best personally from the Born in the USA era.  I know some folks think his more heavy produced type era 80s to Human Touch stuff is not that great but Springsteen at that level is still better than other artists.  Anyways, check it out, I know it's a long listen but worth it and also nice it flows chronologically.  Oh, I also enjoy the acoustic (demo, if I recall??) of Growin' Up.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|British version of a Naked gun type movie.  Great action and just a hilarious movie for adults to see. Must watch

B00EAH3GHI|5.0|I regretted never recording this when it originally aired on MTV but, now it is available to own.  No longer must we watch poor VHS recordings on YouTube.  Regrettably, this concert was videotaped in standard definition, not filmed, so that means the quality will never be HD and a Bluray release will never be possible.  It is also fullscreen like the Live At Reading DVD.  It's no question that this DVD exceeds expectations.  The bonus footage is what I've been wanting all these years.
1936594234|2.0|A friend encouraged me to buy this.  I bought it to shut my friend up.  Turns out I disliked it as much as I thought I would.
B009R659L8|4.0|As always Mary Higgins Clark writes an interesting book.  This is a little different than other books but well worth reading.  Keeps you guessing who is the culprit till the end.  Lots going on.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|We didn't get to watch it on T.V. Now my husband and I enjoy it at our leisure.  Such style!  Such grace!  Such manners!  Such loyalty.  Of course it is a movie of the haves and the have-nots.  But it gives a person a chance to look behind the doors of the rich in the early 1900's.  I like that.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|WHAT A GREAT CLASSIC !<br />I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD....i'M NOW 70 & I STILL SHOWER<br />WITH ONE EYE OPEN !  NO JOKE !<br />I LOVE THIS MOVIE....WHEN I TOLD MY 50 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER THE GIRL IN<br />THE SHOWER WAS JAMIE LEE CURTIS'S MOTHER...SHE WAS IMPRESSED...<br />I LOVE ANTHONY PERKINS...I AM TEAM NORMAN...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Stumbled across this series at the beginning of third season. Actually enrolled in PRIME so that I might see them from the beginning. Marvelous, engaging drama at it's best.
B003SJ4VJ6|2.0|I'm disappointed I spent $3 on this to watch instantly. As so often happens has happened before for me, a \\"great\\" movie (per critics and many viewers) turns out to be boring, poorly written, poorly characterized, and just silly in terms of plot. For a thriller, there was very little mystery and no thrills or suspense. It's hard to tell how the acting was because the characters were so bland and shallow that very little acting was needed. The script calls for no exploration of motives or any true emotion. The plot is ludicrous: (don't worry, no spoilers) if the first writer was such a danger, why would they let the second ghost writer stay in his room without clearing it out? Why would they let the ghost writer sit in meetings where they were discussing political strategy and family matters? Why would the wife and ghost writer be so stupid as to put themselves in danger of Adam's anger (with the knowledge of servants and security guards?) when they thought they were in the power of such a man? And why was Ruth so petulant and bitchy to the ghost writer? Not a good movie.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Pros: good controls, nice choices in equipment, interesting combat, plot exists. Good graphics, a generally addicting and entertaining game.<br /><br />Cons: I have twice had 60+ level characters just vanish. No online saves (despite a splash screen saying otherwise). Almost everything good requires gems, which can be slowly gained for free, including basic things like inventory space.
0749942908|5.0|Without a doubt the best book in the series.  If you are a Lisa Kleypas fan and haven't read this, read it immediately!  Sebastian St. Vincent is one of her top five best heroes and while her heroes tend to be stronger, more interesting characters than the heroines, this book gives us both.<br /><br />The oil and water combination of this beautiful, selfish, useless villainous boy toy and the pathologically shy,abused, stammering virgin is absolute romance novel magical alchemy that delivers big time.<br /><br />It helps to read the previous books in the series for backstory but this book can totally stand on its own.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book. Not only historically accurate, but a compelling read; brings the events of the middle of the 20th century to life. The book is a great service to those generations did not live this history, in particular.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|i Got this app and It was always sticking and it kept restarting and sticking on my new device and that is way and I had to keep deleteing it and restarting it do I give this 1 star
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This application is great. You can look at your location and see all weather information and you can look at any other locations with no problem.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Well developed game.  Especially like the ability to tap to move the card. Wish you could make it harder .
B007FEFLTO|5.0|with an enormous cast of characters, this story is none the less a superb tale told from the perspective of those from very different walks of life.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Headphones produce awesome sound: clear, as loud as you wish. Before I bought these headphones, I did know what was good quality sound in headphones. Even from &#34;ordinary&#34; music source on my notebook.
B009PEPML4|5.0|This band never seems to fail me. Their music is always inspiring and uplifting. This was definitely a worthy purchase.
080701429X|4.0|Very insightful! I find it fascinating that Mr. Franke was able to be of sound mind while incarcerated and still had the sense to minister to others! Having this purpose not only saved his life, but I am sure it also saved many others!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This product arrived on time and came in great condition. The DVDs were where they were supposed to be and the discs work great.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Was a fantastic game until update.  Full of glitches now.  I can play, but has ruined the game for me.  I am deleting from cloud & device!!!  Update -- I went in again, and now the game has re-started from the beginning.  Thank goodness I never used real money on this game, or I would be very angry.  As it is, it has wiped out about 5 months of play time.  Right now another glitch has me in \\"tutorial\\" mode, and has completely frozen up the game.
B009R659L8|5.0|Kept you guessing and wanting to know how it was going to end. Loved it! could not put it down.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|AllTheir CD's are the Best!! Amazon offered a special on 3 of their cd's and I ordered them immediately.<br />Their harmonies and vocal phrasings are unique and Heavenly.. Never too late to be a fan.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Purchased for my wife who enjoyed it. It's a DVD, what else can you say, it worked as it was supposed to. I wouldn't have expected anything less.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I was immediately reminded of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland when I started reading Sheryl Seal's Beyond Bridalveil Fall - Dwellers Of Ahwahnee. Oria, her heroine, is a few years older than Alice, 18, in fact on the day her misadventure begins. Unlike Alice, she doesn't topple down a rabbit hole. Oria plunges into Bridalveil Fall, at the Yosemite National Park, and rather than bubbling back up again, she emerges in a mysterious kingdom where she is both Queen of the Ahwahneechee tribe and a shapeshifter in the tradition of the Iliad and the Epic of Galgamesh, a divine fairy with a mission to lead the tribe in their battle against the diabolical forces luring them into the corrupt world of mankind. If this is a metaphor, it works as metaphors should, subtly and within the subtext.<br /><br />With her morality tale set up, the author astutely provides Oria with that dilemma that has faced 18 year old fairy queens since way back beyond Gilgamesh: a love interest in the shape of Grey Wolf - but, just as she, a shapeshifter, is not exactly what she appears to be - she has serious doubts about Grey Wolf, a thread that takes readers right through to an ending which may be what we expect, but not in the way we expect it. Beyond Bridalveil Fall is well-constructed, nicely written and perfect for children of all ages, even my own, a grand old lady of 28.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This wasn't a bad movie.  I think it captured the youthful cockiness of an early 20th century magician and the special effects are brilliant but done by CGI instead of the imaginative creation from the original Wizard of Oz.  I read that they used colored jello to dye the horses in the Emerald City! How cool was that??!!  I liked the story of how the Wicked Witch became the evil, green skinned bitch that tormented Dorothy later on.  It was a kind of &#34;mash up&#34; of Wicked meets Oz!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Great movie!! Love the cast and the director! Have watched it so many times that I can almost recite it by heart!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Short and sweet - this calculator rocks! It's become my go to calculator now because of it's ease of use. Would recommend to anyone.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|I love Boardwalk Empire!! It is a compelling series that brings you back to the prohibiton era!!! Nucky Thompson is a ruthless character
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game in the market!!!! It updated on August 16th and now has splash text, moon, Sun, sunset, stars, large chests, opening chests, better graphics, beautiful mornings, burning monsters, better spiders, and more!!!! don't use your money on those cheap minecraft replacements. If you want a game with blocks, multiplayer, and danger, then this is the game for you!!!!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christian Bale does it again!! His Batman is amazing!! He is one of a kind as Bruce Wayne and Batman!!

B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Great show - good writing, good action, GREAT actors. Tatiana Maslany is fantastic, and everyone else was very well cast, too. Well done!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I love Django Unchained!! The cast is one of a kind and Jaime Foxx is stellar as Django!! They couldn't of picked a better lead character!!

B007REV4YI|5.0|I think this is one of the best Bond movies to date!! Daniel Craig is not my favorite Bond but he does his best work to date!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|After having played Temple Run, I was sure I would not like this either, but I was wrong. I seem to be able to spend many many hours  playing and it hasn't gotten boring yet.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just like the movie, but it is better because it is just the minions and their cute mumbo jumbo. Overall great and unique game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very intriguing game.  Keeps me busy for a while. Just when you want to give up..You figure out the next clue.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great game, too much tied to Facebook and invest points. Love the go a large but wish I could just play without having to post anything on Facebook. Many items require invest points which take a long Tim e to earn without purchasing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and so do my kids it's a great way to have fun on your android device it's a must have!
B000002L9Y|5.0|Have been a Fleetwood Mac fan for as long as I can remember.  First got this album on vynil, still have it.  The disk is great, though my car player tends to skip around.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|It was a sigma force series book.  Teaches about history, God &  science.  U learn much from his books. Great!
0762445262|1.0|Bought this for my sons room last month and I totally regret this purchase. It is such a low quality and doesn't even serve its purpose. It's lithium battery operated and you can only see the batman signal shine if you put the mini protector right next to the wall. I think you can get something better at the dollar store. Don't waste your time or money on this. Not worth it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is fun distracting keeps you busy and more like it's creative sometimes hard and challenging I love subway surfers and u should take it to another level make it more fun and entertaining I mean make it more bigger is better!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched the first two episodes from the first season and went on a marathon Downton Abbey viewing!  Can't wait for season four!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Good way to waste time. Not took hard not too easy. I like most that this game was a free game
B0064MGU98|5.0|The Good Wife is an interesting show which trades time as a law procedural and a political drama showing the life of Alicia Florrick as she deals with returning to work as lawyer following the arrest of her State's Attorney husband following a prostitution scandal.
B0087DIEGE|4.0|With this accessory it’s impossible to lose the lens cap but it may still allow some dust through the cracks.it was an annoyance to deal with the lens cap that came with this camera, always in the way!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome show that keeps you wanting more without having to include sex and violence in every scene. The story line is all you need.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and  exciting. It is also very addicting. This game is based on both movies. You even get to battle vector and el macho
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus is the first in a new trilogy series by Hugh Howey, who is, in my mind, one of the leaders of the E-book writing revolution.  Read this book and expect to order the other two right after it so you can  follow the story to its conclusion, then hit up the author's blog to keep up to date on his other projects so you can read them too.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I liked this game for the regularity it gives.  Many puzzles and the possibilities are endless. It is enough to get you interested in the game  but not so complicated as to be unsolvable.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I cannot put this baby down. It has 125 obstacles in the sphere and my record is only getting to 47 from start. I will one day beat this game and I will then dominate everything in the world.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|There are not too many albums that I like every song on, but this is one I can put on repeat and keep it going!
0143038419|5.0|Eat Pray Love reads like a blueprint of my own life, and a treasure map out of the bad part, into the healed and amazing.  Although I don't know Elizabeth Gilbert, I feel as if she wrote this book for me.  I don't know how many times I have listened to this kind, well-written, and witty guide through a bad marriage, confusion about core values and beliefs and the surrender when finding the permission for true self-love and what it takes to find one's true north.<br /><br />I don't tire of listening to this book because where ever it is in the story, wherever Liz is in her journey, it is a place that I have not yet mastered and I am happy to re-examine the status of my mental health, my health in general, my muffin-top, or lack there of, my current relationship and my ability to sit with God each day for re-calibration.  While I understand that those readers without a similar set of human defects may not feel the great rapport I feel with the book, it seems they could appreciate that from any point when you enter the river of well-chosen words, the book will glide you to a better place.<br /><br />I feel as if I should write Liz Gilbert a huge thank you note to convey just how profoundly her audio book has and continues to touch my life, each morning, in the dark at about 5:00 walking Bella the Wonder Dog.  I offer gratitude and thanks.<br /><br />Wishing you the very best, Liz, and also to Jose.<br /><br />Cathy Tabor
0061692034|1.0|With long sentences to rival William Faulkner, in Canada Ford tells you what's going to happen before it happens, and bores you to death getting there.  Am at page 150 and wondering what all the excitement is about.  Will continue to push through a few more pages, thinking there must be more.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It up dated yesterday, terrific, . Except now I have music where there was none. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TURN IT OFF. I usually play words while I work the puzzles and it's very distracting. Please just an on off button.
140006922X|5.0|This is a pleasure to read.  Anyone who is interested in learning the reality of the history of Christianity and what was occurring during the times of Jesus's life will enjoy this book.  If you are a fundamentalist or evangelical, you may not be ready for this book nor any others that deal with the reality of Christian history.  However, if you recognize the importance of this history and how it has influenced human history for some 2000 years, this book is for you.  Hopefully, scholarly research into the history of religion will eventually rid humanity of the dangerous thinking and fairy tale beliefs that plague so much of society in this country and others.  Enjoy.  Note: This is not a thorough review of Christian history.  This book deals primarily with the time surrounding the rise of Jesus's ministry.  But, of course, this is when Christian history begins so it is important to understand what happened during this time in order to begin to grasp what would occur in the centuries to follow.
B008602KQI|5.0|Famntastic Movie.  Why do sites like this require a certain amount of words ?  It disourages people from actually rating a movie, product or service.  Just let the customer put as much information as THEY deem appropriate or necessary.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|awesome show! a little slower than most sitcoms/hour dramas that are on tv, but for the better I think. great characters and character development
B001041JLE|5.0|It is absolutely great, I've been listening to everyday since receiving it. I won't stop listening to it until I get enough, which means FOREVER!
B005K17RU0|1.0|The updated interface / navigation is not intuitive.  Too many clicks and swiping to get basic weather info and maps.  Sometimes you'll see white text on a very light background, which makes it almost impossible to read.  Previous interface was better.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I would recommend the first season as well especially considering the same cast is used, for the most part playing different characters in different stories. The story line itself of season is great and reminds me a bit of early x-files.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|WOW! This game is AWESOME!<br /><br />Me and my little brothers and sisters love it!<br />I also love the original one but this one is AWESOME!<br /><br />The price is low too. Only $0.99 cents!<br />ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED!:) &lt;3 (:

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really a family friendly game. Lots of fun. Entertaining. Best game.app that i have dowloaded. Would recommend this game for anyone..
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Rarely does a movie live up to the expectations of the book. The director did a great job staying true to the storyline. What a relief to read the series and NOT be disappointed at all with the screen version! Great job!!
B005EGXTHG|4.0|The exciting sequel to The Hunger Games does not disappoint. I especially liked the developing relationships between Katniss, Peeta & Gale that allow them to evolve and face new adventures ahead. The games were carefully constructed and the new tributes are an interesting bunch.
B003WUYOQ6|2.0|Same info we have heard forever. While I appreciate the in depth explanation. It got too bogged down. Could have said it all a little less wordy.
0385312083|5.0|Listen.  Slaughterhouse-Five has become unstuck in time.  The anti-war novel of Kurt Vonnegut resonated during the Vietnam War, when the book was written, and it resonates today.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse-Five is a jumbled-up memory of the allied firebombing of Dresden.  The author found way to tell the story he couldn't tell straight by using an offbeat manner.  Many of the facts about the firebombing raid were cited from the book [[ASIN:7100113423 The Destruction of Dresden]] by David Irving.  The book was an international bestseller during the 1960s but today it is no longer considered to be an authoritative or reliable account of the Allied bombing and destruction of Dresden.<br /><br />Nobody can discount the horrible images that Vonnegut saw, for even today's best estimate of 25,000 casualties is still wholesale carnage.  His anti-war message had a ready-made audience as Americans of another generation protested the Vietnam War.<br /><br />To best appreciate the novel, a reader must also become unhinged in time.  A novel of Kilgore Trout mentions jellied gasoline, a pretty good description of napalm.  Napalm was infamously used by the US military in Vietnam, but it was also used in the firebombing raid on Dresden.  The five day battle for Hill 875 occurred during the Battle of Dak To in November, 1967.  A guy with an `Impeach Earl Warren' bumper sticker would have been considered conservative.  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was considered a cause of the breakdown of law and order after the Warren Court nationalized the Bill of Rights in its court decisions of the 1960s.  While the Warren Court also reversed `separate but equal' facilities with the `Brown versus Board of Education' decision, segregation was not what `Impeach Earl Warren' was about.<br /><br />The reader cannot be sure of the statements of Billy Pilgrim because he is beginning to lose his marbles.  Pilgrim's stories of Tralfamadore are similar to other-world depictions in the novels ofKilgore Trout, but we also know there is some truth in some of his statements, especially when the narrator says, `That was me.  I was there.'  Pilgrim was there too - Vonnegut modeled the hapless character after a soldier named Joe Crone, who died at a prisoner of war camp in Dresden.<br /><br />The character Wild Bob Cody was based on the grandson of Buffalo Bill Cody, a man named William Cody Garlow.  Garlow had the dubious distinction of having negotiated the surrender of the largest number of American soldiers in the European Theatre of World War II when he did so at the Battle of the Bulge.  His fate was better than that of fictional Wild Bob.  Garlow survived the war, married five times, and became a spokesman for Daisy Air Rifles.<br /><br />Bernard V. O'Hare was a war-time friend with Vonnegut.  After the war, O'Hare became the district attorney for Northampton County in Pennsylvania.  O'Hare traveled with Vonnegut to Dresden as part of the author's research for the novel.  Both Mary O'Hare and the German taxi driver Gerhard Mueller were parts of the real story, too.<br /><br />Adolphe Menjou was an actor from the silent film era, and George Jean Nathan was a drama critic and editor.  It is hard to figure out why Vonnegut mentioned both men in the novel, but they shared the same alma mater as Vonnegut.  Jacqueline Susann was hardly a Cornell graduate but her novel Valley of the Dolls sold thirty million copies.  Interestingly, Valley of the Dolls was made into a movie; the actress Sharon Tate played the role of one of the girls, and the murder investigation of Tate's death was one of the biggest stories of 1969.<br /><br />The most famous line of the book, used more than 100 times, became a catch-phrase for the television broadcaster Linda Ellerbee.  She signed off her broadcasts with that phrase.  The title of [[ASIN:0399130470 her first autobiography]] says it all.<br /><br />Vonnegut included a three-page preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition of Slaughterhouse-Five where he calls George Will an owlish nitwit. Why him?  Why anyone?<br /><br />Slaughterhouse-Five is a target of censors who must want you to read the book, because banning a book is a proven way to generate readership.  Tell a censor off today and read the book.
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|I was intrigued by the original Kick Ass, but not quite a fan after seeing it initially.  After a second viewing I was better able to appreciate the odd sensibilities of the flick and the drastic tonal shifts.<br />If you enjoyed Kick Ass, I can't imagine you hating Kick Ass 2.  Like the original it is genuinely sincere in its emotional content.  It is still infused with a crazy energy and well shot, however where it is significantly worse than the original are a few plot elements used (rather lazily in my opinion) to connect the second and third acts.<br />The movie also is a tad more reserved with the violent content, nothing that happens is close to as brutal as the original, hell The Wolverine has a much higher on screen body count.  That doesn't mean we're anywhere near gaining a PG-13, but it made the film a bit more fun for me.  A gang rape was among the content cut from Millar's original book.<br />Full Review at M.R. Gott's Cutis Anserina.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids and I love this game.<br /><br />We have a great time trying to finish the missions and collecting the special items for each city we travel to.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Received item promptly, and viewed entire DVD set in one sitting. Extremely well done. Only things I would add is more footage and music on 2nd disc for &#34;Long Road out of Eden&#34; and if possible, more songs on the disc 3 live concert from 1977. Disc 1 was thorough and very informative. A must-have collection for every true Eagles fan!!! Also, a great value for the money...

B00CW665VI|4.0|Okay, at first, I was thinking that Drew was the biggest jerk in the world and I didn't know if I could continue to read it. But I stuck with it and seriously loved the way it turned out. Drew was funny as hell and ended up changing his ways for the right woman and became the guy that every girls wants. And Kate! God, she was amazing! Strong, smart, beautiful and didn't take any shit. I also loved the way it was written, I loved that it was from Drew's POV and that he was talking to the reader. It was different and very entertaining. I will definitely read more books from this very talented author.
034553056X|5.0|Well, I haven't read It yet.  But John Grisham is a great writer so expect a good read.  If you have not read<br />&#34;Playing for Pizza&#34;. Give ir a read.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is one of my most favorite games. it soo super super fun! I hope everyone that plays it invites their friends to play this amazing game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. However it is very addictive so unless you have time don't get started. This game is good for kids and adults. This is definitely my favorite game and the best game ever.
B001EED1N4|5.0|My son fell in love with this book before he was one.  With it came his love of farm animals!  We still read this book, even though he is now almost 3.  He repeats the words, and he comments how silly the animals are.  I absolutely adore Sandra Boynton books!
B00006L411|5.0|I love Sigur Ros, and this is the best other than takk. The seller was prompt and the product was what I had ordered.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|There are so many twists and turns in this story. It starts out with a 100 year old man escaping from an old age home to avoid his birthday party. The characters are very funny and the plot unbelievable.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|After trying probably more than 10 times, I couldn't even get it to download. Not much else to say. Boo
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Watched this show online after it aired on BBCAmerica and I could not get enough! With snappy and clever dialogue plus great acting (perhaps most especially by Tatiana Maslany, playing around 7 different parts), the storyline reveals itself in an enthralling manner and in watching the season's ten episodes (a short season being a possible advantage to the storytelling) I was on the edge of my seat and instantly hooked. Although technically science fiction, the acting, writing and overall plot has me recommending this show to others who usually aren't interested in sci-fi.
0671449028|4.0|I know from the past that if it is by Sandra Boynton it will be cute and funny and to the point - in other words - fun for baby and fun for the person reading TO baby
B00B7Y0206|2.0|When I first got on, I thought that it would be great.  I tried to watch a video, and it would buffer and load literally every seven or so seconds.  I managed to get through one video without any stopping, but it continued to happen on my other videos.  So I did what I would do on my computer when a video buffered:  I set it back a few seconds so it could keep loading before the dial.  That doesn't work for this.  If you set the dial back, the bit that has already loaded re sets and you're back to waiting for it to load.  :(
0689835604|4.0|I like this book because it can be read by mother or parent ,grandparent or young child to baby and then when baby is a little older it becomes an interactive experience as baby learns to lif the flap and even later to identify in worsds the object.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Refreshing plot and story line. I was relatively impressed with the story telling. I do not impress easily. The authors wit, and ability to create a scene had my imagination firing on all cylinders. What a great introduction into the  looking glass of this author's mind.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|it fits the phone perfectly. I needed a case that would protect the phone from normal wear and tear scratched and such. the case also got a lot of impressive looks. very nice.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is very nicely done with great graphics and themes but those special boosts are kind of hard to earn. Some levels seem impossible unless you  purchase a couple of helpers but it's really good still.
B003QSIM30|5.0|When I first watched this movie a few years back, I was so stunned by the gorgeous animation, I had to do a little more research.  This movie was actually hand drawn using digital tablets so it has that traditional hand-drawn Disney look but because they did it digitally, it still has that stunning saturated digital appearance.  The storyline is typical Disney princess but the voice actors are wonderful and the soundtrack is amazing!  Its a great movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon with the kiddos.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I am not a gamer, like puzzles and games that are quick. It took me a while to figure out how to play but it is a lot of fun. Price is right.
B001IF252C|3.0|I was looking for a solution to hook up my 1st generation 30&#34; Apple Display Monitor with my MacBook Pro Retina (mid-2012). It works for that application. I rated only three stars for it being quite pricey and the fact that intermittently the monitor will display double images for everything.  If you pull the mini-display adapter plug out and put it back in the display jack on the laptop, everything is fine again for a couple of days.  More of an annoyance than anything.
B0063IH60K|2.0|After having this on my kindle for several months now; I have found that I can't use it some times because it tells me to connect to the web, sometimes I cannot and just want to play the game. I am very disappointed that it just don't work anytime anywhere.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the actors-actresses-scenery-beautiful clothes-the storyline is captivating. It is full of every class of people and difficulties and happy times that just jump off the screen.
B00422LESO|4.0|This book was a really fun, light read. Austen fans will enjoy the way the author puts a modern spin on traditional Austen tropes. I thought the ending was cute as well. I will probably read the other Austenland novels.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I read multitudes of reviews &  finally settled on this over the Kindle case for two reasons. One was price & the other the reviewers said that the Kindle doesn't stand well without sliding. Well, I am completely satisfied on both counts. I like<br />the look & feel of this case. It seems well made & I am fine with the elastic to keep it closed. I wasn't sure the magnet  would keep holding. This does turn off upon closing as it says. And the rubber feel of the inside cover keeps it in whatever angle I put it with nary a slip! It charges in the closed position as well. IMO a great case for the price.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Great little book for putting being creative in perspective. Anyone who is in a creative field needs to read it. I gave it five stars because the message was succinct and presented in a creative way.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|The book enables the reader to approach life from a more positive point of view.<br />There's a lot to think about. You can buy into all of it or not. However, it certainly helps change your thought processes for the better.<br />I recommend the book.
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|I thought the racial and immigrant stories were spot on and should help raise sensitivities.  However the endless affairs &#34;broken hearts&#34; plus the constant distancing from her true love seemed more like a novelistic gimmick in order to add pages to the book.  Often it seemed circular.  I enjoyed the blogging about race and the difficulties immigrants face are well portrayed.  It's just that the love story seemed a bit weird and protracted.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Always been a John Fogerty fan and this CD does not disappoint. Has a good variety of Fogerty songs and CCR stuff

Because its not cut onto two LP's there is not enough level to get to the music thats there,  This need to be re-mastered the right way.  Are the people responsible listening.  What a waste when it could have been done right the first time.,  do it right or not at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0345803485|1.0|After reading for a while I wanted to quit because the writing was so bad especially the juvenile dialog.<br />I finished reluctantly because I paid full price for this piece of garbage.  Even the \\"porn\\" parts were more laughable than titillating.<br />By the end of the book she should have used a title with the word \\"toilet\\" in it, since the word \\"flush\\" or \\"flushed\\" appears over and over page after page.<br />If I had the time and inclination I'd count how many time she uses that word.  I'd bet it's in the hundreds.<br />Where was the editor? probably in the bathroom when he or she should have been editing this book.
B005NFJAMG|3.0|This tense action thriller is a well-directed and engaging film from the days before studios watered down action films to get a PG-13 rating, and is a good way to pass a couple of hours. However, it is sadly hampered by the fact that, in this post 9/11 world, the Blu-ray editions have been pre-cut by Warner Bros. to remove references to Islamic fundamentalism. Funnily enough, I don't remember anyone complaining about it in 1996 when it was first released... Anyway, if you examine the back of the Blu-ray case, you will see quite clearly the words, \\"This R-rated version contains material different from the original R-rated version\\". Uh-oh, alarm bells should be ringing. So what is missing?<br /><br />To begin with, around 10½ minutes into the film, the appearance of the terrorist in the restaurant has been censored to remove the sight of him holding the Qur'an along with a necklace. These items have been digitally removed, so he now appears to not be holding anything, and standing with his hand formed into an awkwardly-shaped fist.<br /><br />Around 65 minutes into the film, footage of Nagi (David Suchet) gesturing towards- and handling the Qur'an as he states, \\"it will all be over very soon\\" has been replaced with footage where he is simply holding the book as he speaks, thus removing the implication of religion and violence going hand in hand.<br /><br />At 97 minutes, the sight of Nagi praying has been removed, along with -- bizarrely -- two innocent shots of the airplane pilots. A few seconds later, when the airplane telephone rings, we do not see Nagi rising from a prayer position before answering the call.<br /><br />It may not amount to much, but true fans of cinema will always prefer to see an uncut version of any film. Warner Bros. have dropped the ball on this one, and as a result I can only recommend the original 1997 US DVD version for fans wanting the original and complete cut of the film (the 2010 re-release in a keepcase features the censored version as well). The UK DVD was cut for violence at the beginning of the film to remove knife play, but also removed footage of Nagi praying. Other DVDs (including the Australian version) used the cut UK master, and cannot be recommended. So although the A/V quality will not be up to par with current HD technology, the original 1997 US DVD pressing is the only version of the film I can recommend, as I strongly oppose censorship of the arts in any form - particularly when they are motivated by political correctness.s well).

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Enjoyable.  Thought provoking. Was thrilled that there are in game hints. Only downside you can't adjust the sound or music which was a little loud for my taste.  Looking forward either to full game or you might consider 2$ story installments.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very scholarly and thoroughly researched book about the historical Jesus. Many, many things I always wondered about are explained.  The description of life in the 1st century Palestine is the best I've ever read.  You will not be able to put this book down and you will emerge fully understanding how Christianity evolved.

0385347774|5.0|I had difficulty putting it down. Intricate plot, great character development, an insightful psychological thriller. A great read on the beach, or long winter nights.
B00B7FXZQS|5.0|Paranormal Activity Four Rating would view it again and want to but on Blu-Ray disc or DVD.  Once you've watched the first three you have to watch the last one.  It was just as scary and maybe just little bit more than the first three.

B000ICLRIE|4.0|A expansive telling of the story of the crusades. The story is hard to follow without a historical understanding of the crusades. But the story of Orlando Bloom's character keeps the story going.

Keeps moving at a good pace with lots of excitement, and as always Tarantino never fails to deliver. delivers a  Starring: Jamie Foxx, Chistoph Waltz,  Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel Jackson, and Don Johnson give stellar performances. I watched it 3 times during the Amazon Instant video rental time. Loved the 48 hrs availability for the watching timeframe.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Very well costumed and great sets that place you in the time of Robin Hood's period. Russell Crow and Kate Blanchet are believable in their roles. The story drags a bit and an understanding of the period would help keep the story straight.
0316228532|2.0|I barely made it through the first three chapters and then stuck the book on the bookshelf.  I'm no prude but the overuse of the &#34;f&#34; word was very offensive and quickly lost any intended emotional ambience.  I hope I can find some poor soul to give it to.

Best $20 I've ever spent!

B009UNGYHG|5.0|Obviously bought this in conjunction with the Voyager Legend and I'm glad I did.  Simply a wonderful case.  Sleek, easy to carry, protects the headset well.  However, the best feature is that it continuously charges the headset so that whenever you do need to use it, it is fully charged.  I keep it in my car and have a travel charger cord and couldn't be happier.
B0053B347M|4.0|it helps but it doesn't do much against a huge monitor glaring bright in your face. they are cheap enough that buying a second or third isn't that big of deal but then you have 3 usb taken up. i wish the the tv size could be applied in a way that it you could run it back and forth across the back of the monitor multiple times. the one on my tv works great.

At first I didn't think I would like it but I have to say it sucks you in with a rollercoaster of ups and downs, family love, family respect and a lot of magic to boot.

0670021652|5.0|This was such a great book and I wish everyone would read this before getting married. I learned so much and feel like I have greatly benefited from the information. The only thing I wish she would have discussed is marriages that are non-monogamous. I don't see why she couldn't have discussed this in her book, given the amount of people who swing or have tried some form of non-monogamy, or have experienced infideltiy. Since humans aren't naturally monogamous, I would have been interested to learn a bit about infidelity or open non-monogamy. She did mention that her and her husband decided they were going to be faithful, so I guess because she wasn't interested in non-monogamous marriage she didn't cover it. But most marriages start out with the intention of being monogamous. Other than this, it was a great book, and I liked it even more than Eat, Pray, Love.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was so excited to get this little gadget along with 3 months free Netflix!  I must say that as I waited for it to arrive, I became anxious that I wouldn't be able to get it to work with my TV. My fears were unfounded, though. I followed the super easy instructions for Chromecast and I also followed the equally easy instructions for connecting with Netflix with the code for the free 3 months and in approximately 15 minutes I was watching a movie on my flat screen TV. My TV is an RCA bought in 2009. It is not considered fancy by anyone's standard. Your TV will need a USB port and a HDMI port. It helps if those two are near each other as mine are. There is a selection of cords, however, so if your TV does not have the USB port, there are other ways to supply the Chromecast with power. I think there is even an AC attachment. It comes in a very impressive box, so if you are giving as a gift, it will deliver a nice impact.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|On the opening main page of Bingo Blitz there was an offer to purchase Bingo Blitz credits. I tried to purchase the larger offer of 1750 credits for $99.00 dollars. When I hit the purchase button my credit card was immediately charged. NO credits were added to the amount of credits on the game site. So this must be a scam/hack thing. The transaction must have gone through Face Book or Amazon. I have written Bingo Blitz 3 times now and Face Book twice. I also had to cancel my Credit Card and file a fraud report with the .gov site to had it investigated. I still have no credits on my AOL account and no one had gotten back in touch with me. So either I have been ripped off or my 1750 credit are floating in space some where. There is no phone number to actually talk to a person and this has discouraged me any many of my friends/team-mates to not want to play Bingo Blitz any more. I have also read on the chats that this has happened to other people and NO-ONE one is happy about it. Please look into this and fix it before you loose all your customers. You can contact me at p.munday@aol.com.

Sanders also works some phenomenal illusions into her writing, giving you hints and peaks at things without ever actually mentioning them.  I got so wrapped up in the stellar storyline that before I knew it hours had passed and I hadn't put the novel down.  That said, there were definitely some spelling and grammatical issues to contend with, but overall this was quite an amazing novel.  I had to go back over some sentences to figure out what the author had intended to say, rather than what was published.<br /><br />I loved the characters that were developed for this novel.  They were all such real individuals who had lives and issues of their own.  Although each was perfectly suited for their role in the story, none were perfect.  It was a great balance.<br /><br />Overall, this was a 4 star storyline but the severe editing issues knocked it down to a 3 star novel.  The story and characters, however, would be worth following through the series as a whole.<br /><br />Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review.

B005EG4J70|5.0|Many years ago, while still in high school (USA), I learned of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, its bannings and burnings, the ruckus it was still making around the world, and its purported content: `the mindless, insane rantings and ravings of an evil lunatic'. Even then, it struck me that `there was something wrong with this picture\\", it just didn't seem to add up. Why burn or ban a book that was nothing but mindless ranting and raving? What could there be in it or about it to fear? Such fervor and fear as was apparent in the actions of communities and countries around the entire world suggested an entirely different content than what was \\"advertised\\". I remember trying to find a copy in our small town, and soon learned to look surreptitiously, to avoid the indignant stares, diatribes, and rebukes I faced at first.  I couldn't get a copy.  This all came as quite a shock to me. In schools? In libraries? In America?<br /><br />Over the next umpteen years, something would occasionally bring the puzzle to mind again, but I was always too busy to look into it. Finally, about 5 years ago, I decided once again to find out the truth for myself.  Armed now with the internet and Amazon, I researched  the available (English) translations, comparing opinions and reviews and comments, and cross-compared fragments of the various translations. It didn't take long to settle on the original Murphy 1939 translation, and I am very glad I did. It reads vastly better than its competitors; Murphy's translation \\"lives\\". I highly recommend it. I was lucky enough to find and purchase a good copy of the Hurst and Blackett unexpurgated 1939 original edition ... and finally read Mein Kampf, in all its terror and glory.<br /><br />And, of course, Mein Kampf is not at all `the mindless, insane rantings and ravings of an evil  lunatic'. It is, pretty much, just the opposite. The reasoning, the logic, the analyses, are generally brilliant and rock solid.  Just what one would expect from a man who was able to rise from nothing to the pinnacle of German politics, build a loyal, devoted base willing to embrace a fuhrerprinzip and follow him into the jaws of Hell, and threaten to decimate and conquer the world from one small country.  I intended to write this review immediately after reading the book and made some notes in that regard, but never got around to it.<br /><br />So, why write the review now?  A couple of reasons, but mostly just because Mein Kampf is now on my top-11 list of non-technical, non-fiction books, among giants like The Origin of Species, The Nichomachean Ethics, Beyond Good and Evil, The Wealth of Nations, Being and Nothingness, CPR, Atlas Shrugged, and The Ego and Its Own. Mind expanding. Filled with sublime insights. Thus this review.<br /><br />Naturally enough, Mein Kampf (My Struggle) begins with Hitler's childhood. We almost immediately see, from Hitler's own words, the groundwork being laid for his lifelong passion, in the form of alienated, \\"second-class-citizen\\" status for Germans, effective ex-patriots residing in ex-Bavarian, ex-German,  Austria. This passion was not anti-Semitism, nor the so-called \\"Jewish question\\" of the time, which were subordinate additions. Hitler's lifelong idee fixe, his obsession, his mania, was German nationalism, everything else being derivative of this, his Ideal, his \\"god\\". Sometime, somewhere, long ago, I remember seeing Nazi-ism \\"defined\\" as \\"palingenetic ultra-nationalism\\".  This is obviously not really a definition, but it perfectly expresses Hitler's idee fixe, the essence of the resultant Nazi movement, his  basic rallying cry to, at first, all who would listen, and then later, to the masses, and the Zeitgheist of both Mein Kampf and the Third Reich. Hitler's enmity toward the \\"Sozi's\\" (Socialists, aka communists) in general, and toward the Jews in particular, were derivative of this.<br /><br />It is important in reading Mein Kampf to recognize at the outset something that Hitler will tell you himself only much later on, and which makes it very difficult to draw reasonably firm conclusions about many things (For instance, one of my main interests in reading the book was to find out whether, or in what degree, Hitler's anti-Semitism was real and \\"personal\\", or merely contrived: to manipulate by \\"uniting against a common enemy\\"). For Hitler ALWAYS carefully targeted his particular audience, tailored his speech to his audience, a technique which in and of itself is both cynical and dishonest. In fact, Hitler prided himself (as he will later tell) on being able to speak before a divided audience, two groups openly hostile to each other and their ideas, and end with thunderous applause from BOTH groups; he having successfully \\"said\\" different things to the two groups at the same time. This requires careful psychological pre-analysis and very carefully contrived equivocation, as well as other forms of \\"lying\\", which today we have  recently seen in copious example from another \\"personality-cult\\" leader.  Hitler's speeches were also distinct from his written pamphlets, etc., for he knew that those who would read were very different from those who would merely listen. Thus he could tailor his writings to a higher class audience, confide to them that which he would never say to the masses, and make them feel \\"special\\"; this he will also tell later on. Thus we must recognize that tHIS book, Mein Kampf, is ALSO tailored to its expected audience, is intended to inform and appeal to that audience, and employs equivocation, subreption, obreption, etc., all as \\"appropriate\\" to that audience: us. For this reason, nothing which appears, or does not appear, in Mein Kampf can be taken simply at face value when it may be reasonably suspected of self-serving the author. This, no doubt, partly explains the very restricted and muted anti-semitic rhetoric to be found in Mein Kampf, which probably bears a strong resemblance to the rhetoric \\"du jour\\" regarding the \\"Jewish question\\", just as it does to our own recent OWS protestors and their \\"anti-1%ers\\" rhetoric.<br /><br />There now follow a few general remarks about the content of Mein Kampf, first the intellectual content, then the \\"emotional\\" content:<br /><br />Intellectual:  Read the book and you will be struck by the obvious genius of its author. On the level of Reason and Perspicacity,  Mein Kampf  offers a kaleidoscopic window on our world, an astonishing number of penetrating analyses and insights. Literally hundreds of them. Many of which you will find aptly characterize the worst behavior of politicians and our elected representatives even today. Mein Kampf is fascinating, absorbing, astonishingly lucid (especially in regard to psychological and sociological observations), and refreshingly PC-free as it cuts straight to the heart of the matter, over and over again.  Here, we find gem after gem, the ring of Truth is everywhere.  And this we realize, was the real source of Hitler's power, what he was all about, the penetrating power of the mind that enabled him to do what he did.<br /><br />\\"Emotional\\": At the same time, one is struck by something unconcernedly cold and calculating, almost reptilian in nature, behind the writing. Something ruthless and trenchant, even literally ruth-less. Utterly and consciencelessly Darwinian. Or better, cybernetic. Something that can bitterly castigate the Sozi's for their deplorable tactics one moment, and then in the next breath coolly adopt those very same tactics without further ado. Because \\"they work\\". Something that functions routinely, relentlessly,  and consciously on the simple basis of  the pragmatic theory of truth. ... But, at the same time, displays a ferocity of passion for his own idee fixe, a fearsome personal psychological pain of his own that drives him relentlessly, a rage that makes him such a \\"ferocious genius\\", yet drives him also to (Self?-) delusion and destruction. ... One is reminded in this way of some of the descriptionsof the psychopath Ted Bundy.<br /><br />Reason devoid of Ruth. Hmm. Not bad.<br /><br />And the real nature of the book, not its (soft-peddled) anti-semitism or \\"insane ranting\\", has been, of course, the true motivation for all the book banners and burners around the world, which always seem to present a Liberal, and even a Jewish, basis (compare this to the absence of such reaction to Das Kapital, the 'bible' of Marxist, Leninist, Maoist socialism and communism, despite the tens of millions of victims of communist Russia and China ... and elsewhere.).  Unless we attribute it to a confusion in some minds between a Book and a Man, or a Book and Real-world Events.  Even today one encounters notices like this (current) one: \\"Please note due to Ebay rules bids will not be accepted from Germany, Austria, France, Italy or Israel.\\"<br /><br />Reason devoid of Ruth? ... this casts an interesting sidelight on the European (and Asian) Left of the last couple of centuries, and the espousal of Liberalism as nothing but the application of Reason to our societal relations: what \\"pure\\" reason, devoid of \\"the rest of us\\" can really become, can really do. Viz., the wages of communism above. ... Wait .... is that an ironic Stirnerian snort I hear?<br /><br />To go into specific detail regarding Mein Kampf would be a terribly daunting task, for once begun so many examples would cry out for notice. And since some of these have been presented in other reviews, I think I will simply conclude with:<br /><br />>>>>> Why read Mein Kampf?:<br /><br />>>  Read it for its insight into the deplorable methods employed by the Sozi's, who are easily recognized as the spitting image of today's liberal Left.<br /><br />>>  Read it for its castigation of the do-nothing conservative wing, whose fecklessness Hitler \\"roasts\\" in Mein Kampf, and which is utterly parallel to the follies of today's Republicans, whose members seem unable to see beyond their own narrow fears and interests.<br /><br />>>  Read it if you've ever wondered what noir and cynical thoughts really motivate politicking Pols, what reasoning dominates the \\"backrooms\\" of politics: for Hitler's psychological and sociological evaluations of the \\"masses\\" lead to his espousal of techniques identical to those we see routinely practiced by politicians today.<br /><br />>>  Read it for its refreshingly cold-blooded Logic which, devoid of PC saccharine-speak, imperturbably reasons its way, with cybernetic implacability, beyond the bounds of humanity ...<br /><br />>>  Read it to enjoy the wonderful writing, the almost poetic beauty of its analogical and metaphoric exposition (notwithstanding comments to the contrary).

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So we managed to get a ChromeCast unit.  I was slightly apprehensive based on some of the other 1 star reviews here, but after playing with it for a few hours, I am totally satisfied and glad we purchased this unit.  First of all, we have an HDTV but from the era before 'smart' TV's.  Second, we don't have a cable or satellite TV Provider.. (ie: I'm not paying $100 a month for anything).  We do enjoy watching Netflix.<br /><br />Tech... -The setup was easy.  It just worked.  Simple.  Follow the directions printed in the box.  You plug it into the HDMI port on the TV.  Then you plug it into a power source.  Switch the TV Input to see it on the screen, it says Hello!.  On your computer you go to the web url and it asks you to download a small bit of software.  You run it, it auto configures everything.  You give it the wifi password.  Done. Chromecast app from the Play store on the android devices and it works.  Neflix and Youtube apps now have a button to cast to the tv.  Nothing complicated at all.  We have a PC with Google Chrome as a browser, and we have a Nexus 7 tablet, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 (v2), and Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone devices.<br /><br />Tabcasting- So you can cast from the tab in google chrome.  This works great, and the resolution is good too.  No stuttering, no chop, sound is in sync with the video.  Drag and drop movies into chrome, cast that onto the big screen too.  at 720P, it looks great.  The picture is smooth and defined, no pixelation, no chop, sound is once again in sync.  This is with 720p 256-512bps AVI files.  (you know, the ones that are on average 1gig in size per movie).<br /><br />Specs - Google indicates that the device is 1080p capable, but for tab casting there are 3 options, 480p, 720p, and 720p high bitrate.  Note, this is FOR TABCASTING.  Youtube videos and Netflix content are directly streamed by the device and the HD content streams in HD.  Youtube content sometimes starts out at a low res (blurry, w/ lots of huge pixels) but as the stream buffers it steps up the bitrate to the native resolution the content was filmed in.<br /><br />The secret...  We don't have bandwidth issues.  We have high speed internet with a 20mb down speed on a DOCSIS 3 protocol router with 4 channel upstream bonding.  So streaming Netflix in HD to 5 devices at the same time does not cause our bandwidth to suffer.  So Rule #1.. you NEED to have quality internet.  The other half is just as important.  We don't rent a crappy modem with wifi AP... We own our modem, and we own our Wifi Router.  We have a Linksys E3200, so nothing fancy, BUT it is a simultaneous dual band 802.11n capable router serving 7 or 8 devices at any given time.  So we have good bandwidth distribution, the router is located centrally, and half of the devices are n capable, a third of those are dual band capable or operate on the 5ghz band, and the rest of the devices are 802.11g on 2.4ghz... This means the data can get there efficiently and there is no bottleneck.<br /><br />The Chromecast device is 2.4ghz 802.11 b/g/n... so having a strong wifi network is important.<br /><br />Overall, TOTALLY worth it.  Costs less than a Roku, and allows control at your fingertips from anywhere on the network.  I can start a Netflix video on my phone, and while i'm sitting somewhere else, pick up a tablet, any tablet, and am able to pause the netflix video or change the cast stream.<br />Looking forward to more Chromecast apps, but totally satisfied with what we have.

B0094AH3F2|5.0|Traditional performances from the past of this magnificent grand opera where Verdi even beat Meyerbeer in his own game,<br />were a mixed bag of monks walking around with lighted torches, colorful Spanish crowd scenes with dances, drinking songs and soldiers marching around. They were audience pleasers, so the average people got their money's worth.<br /><br />For Verdi's 200th anniversary this certainly wasn't good enough. The very talented designer, Stefano Poda took this opera much more seriously and given it a new meaning, actually the meaning it always should have been there, but wasn't. The opera is about dark fate pursuing the seemingly helpless characters, about resentment, obsessive revenge and the ultimate destruction, such as War. There is also a strong element of Religion and people's escape into it for protection and consolation. All these elements are omnipresent in the dark hued, but monumental sets of monolithic slabs, sometimes pitch black and sometimes shining in silver hues plus a giant sculpted cross radiantly shining and dominating the scenes. So the set design and the stage movements that are very solemn for the religious scenes and disturbing, angular for the war scenes, all contribute to the real meaning of this opera.The dark hues prevail as they should.<br /><br />The musical handling is also quite different from the traditional bombast, lack of coherence that used to degrade this piece into an uneven, second rate Verdi. Much thought must have been given to the emotional content of every phrase, the proper dynamics (never too loud, but many shades of mezzoforte and piano. The orchestra, led by my favorite conductor, Gianluigi Gemetti is absolutely magnificent, starting with a fresh account of the beautiful overture.Gemetti has a sweeping, epic vision of the score somewhat reminiscent of the late, great Giuseppe Sinopoli, but he also has a light touch and grace.'Forza' now shines through like never before, into one of Verdi's greatest!<br /><br />The singers were carefully selected from the best principals of the series.I am not a singer crazy technical aficionado, I leave this to the 'experts' those who no doubt will discuss it in detail, but I have rarely heard such sustained pp singing as what leading lady, Dimitra Theodossiou produced. Other wonderful star is Vladimir Stoyanov, as Don Carlos, a many shaded characterization and powerful voice.Tenor lead is a gruelling role, but I am quite pleased with Aquiles Machado's passionate Don Alvaro. The mezzo lead, a lesser,but very  affecting and interesting character here again is handled in a more original, different fashion. She is by no means the traditional happy-go-lucky gypsy girl, but a more severe Spanish lady with compassion and looming tragedy in her eye. Mariana Pencheva is memorable.<br /><br />This is a distinguished, very original,somewhat subdued perormance with none of the circus about it. I loved it.<br />The singers were carefully selected from the best principals of the series.I am not a singer crazy technical aficionado, I leave this to the 'experts' those who no doubt will discuss it in detail, but I have rarely heard such sustained pp singing as what leading lady, Dimitra Theodossiou produced.

B00006EXL5|5.0|This is the best purchase I've made all year! I'm a huge MCR fan and now that they've split up, I really wanted to add this awesome CD to my MCR collection. I'll always treasure it and it certainly WON'T become a casualty of Ebay! ..... Thank you so much for allowing me to purchase this outstanding CD. You ROCK!!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love the chemistry between all the characters in this show.  I am anxious to see Season 4 as Season 3 ended with a cliff hanger.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is the second Smith pocket sharpener that I have purchased. I keep one in my tackle box and one at work.  It does a great job sharpening and honing (even on serrated blades using the stick), but you need to be careful when using it. If you are not paying attention to what you are doing, it's easy to slip the blade out of the groove and slice your finger.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|Funny, interesting enough to hold my attention thru the entire movie.  I would suggest watching this movie if you want to have an uplifting experience.
082300659X|5.0|This is now my favorite book on the subject of learning to draw. Chapter by chapter, Juliette makes the subject interesting and manageable. The accompanying DVD is priceless. It makes the book a bargain. Not only do you get some of the best methods and lessons but also the demonstrations by an accomplished artist. If you cannot afford to travel to one of her courses, then this may be the next best thing. I have spent hours with it already and refer to it constantly.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Some library books must be transferred to the Kindle Fire via USB and this meets that need perfectly. Its compact container offers convenient storage..
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Average combat game, too many popups asking for reviews or to play other games.  Easy to click on the wrong thing and accidentally spend valuable resources.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this story! It reminded me of another favorite, Wait For Me. Travis was adorable and even though he had a temper from hell, you loved him because he was raw and honest. Abby fought her feelings for him for so long, it was refreshing to have Travis be the grown up and say enough was enough!  There were fights, sweet lovemaking, jealous boys and girls..This was a wonderful, well rounded story that I will read again. Very sweet!
B00821OX98|5.0|I just like the subject matter.  The acting was also very good.  I would like to see more of this type of programming on TV.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|You walk around any urban area and you are sure to see a t-shirt or poster referring to the Tony Montana from Scarface.  One of the modern gangster movies and ranked number eighth as one of the most popular cult movies, Scarface is part of the American lexicon.<br />In Scarface: The Ultimate Guide by Damian Stevenson has written a marvelous condense account of the movie. The author notes that he has viewed this movie over 200 times.<br />It has background on the characters, a good synopsis of the acts of the scene and some of the symbolism of the movie's subplots.<br />I remember seeing this movie and being sucked into the story as a story of the American dream gone wild.  It has many claims, one being that it was the first movie to over use of the F-bomb, over 200 times.<br />Al Pacino did a remarkable believable job of portraying this immigrant gangster that held nothing back.<br />This movie guide book is perfect to read before a screening of Scarface, a film about the greed and corruption of the 1980s.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I love this author and have enjoyed this series immensely!! Ms. Signh gives a great world of characters and keeps us interested from start to finish.
B00BMQDM10|1.0|Flat, dull and boring are the words to describe this novel.<br /><br />All the characters were stupid, and in a way where I wondered how they held down jobs, homes and relationships. There wasn't a memorable character among them. The storyline was OK, or would have been if the supporting characters were real, but unfortunately cartoon like characters let this book down.<br /><br />If there was a zero star for this book I'd have clicked that instead of the \\"one\\".<br /><br />Bah!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I love how this author world builds with apparent ease, and how she weaves her characters lives together seamlessly. I stopped reading the author L.K.H. because of the endless porno like sex scenes in her books, so I must admit that I can't stand the length of the sex scenes in this series either, even if they are part of a deeper connection between the characters, but for this series I've been just skimming over them hoping that I'm not missing too much.
B008133MDK|5.0|Thrilled this was available on Prime Instant Video.  Just as good as Season One. Very well acted.  Definitely watch this.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I found this book both uplifting and gratifying. It is about overcoming challenges and being kind to others. I recommend this book to anyone who has a heart and could you some extra happiness in their life.
B000002KHH|5.0|I must say that this cd is a MUST and every single song on here is a great song, i especially like the solo of Bill Ward on the drums on the track \\"Rat Salad\\"..He is one hell of a drummer..\\"Electric Funeral\\", that is probably one of the baddest tracks, i mean its hard to pick a favorite b/c each track is bad..But in order to get into Black Sabbath, you have to listen to their debut album, the title track \\"Black Sabbath\\" is my favorite b/c i like how is starts in the beginning with the sound of rain and a bell..there have been many rainy nights ive sat outside with thats ong playing in my car, talking bout relaxing..I wasnt into heavy metal until i was introduced to Black Sabbath..I strongly recommend this cd and i PROMISE you will not be disappointed

0316056863|5.0|I grabbed a paperback copy of Bossypants one day when I was feeling the need to indulge myself. I hope the publisher doesn't pay Tina less for paperback sales. Anyway, I couldn't wait to get home and read it.  I was not the least bit disappointed! First of all, it's a memoir. That means there are gonna be details left out, and it's gonna be a lot of point-of-view stuff, it's gonna jump around a lot, and frankly that's exactly what I wanted.  I laughed out loud repeatedly, and with vigor.  I learned to appreciate Amy Poehler even more and I didn't know that was possible! For about two and a half days I felt like I was Tina's friend, and IT. WAS. GLORIOUS!!  I love you Tina Fey!!

0385737955|5.0|This first book was my favorite of the series, it can almost end with this one. Almost. Loved the writing style.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very disappointing. Paid more than double as Google site is on back order. It's such a beta version that doesn't meet my expectations
0385738781|4.0|Great ending, what seemed so insurmountable ended up having an obvious solution, not an ideal decision but necessary nonetheless. Great writing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great solitaire game. I like that you can just tap a card to move it or you can drag the card to where you want it. Hours of fun... The only down side is all the pop up adds and pop ups asking to like on Facebook and Twitter, if not for that I would give five stars.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|This is my favorite edition of Les Mis. And only 17.50 for 41 songs? Incredible deal. I love each one!
B00177E1Z0|3.0|I got copies of the songs I needed but wasn't overly impressed with the others.  I guess I appreciated the actual movie more than the songs they chose.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora is like combining Oliver Twist with a very fantastical version of Venice, Italy. Also, Mafia.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Awesomely fun game that is challenging and time consuming!! Very addictive and will leave you begging for more!<br />I want more levels faster!<br />Hurry and t r y this game
B00992CF6W|3.0|Okay, I see there has been an update, but my friend has waited three days for his and he was jelly, but there was no reason to be because, aside from the better graphics and new title screen, the controls are a bit worse because instead of placing blocks freely around the screen, you now have to line up crosshairs and its getting annoying. Also, there is no flint and steel in creative and the endermen sneered to be there. Thanks. :)
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Love the game.  Wonderful addition to temple run 2.  Would love to  see witch.  Love china girl.  Graphics are awesome and beautiful.<br />Love it  Love it. Love it.  Awesome game.  Don't  stop me when I' m on a long  run.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app is a good opportunity for kids who wanted horses and can't have them in real life but can have a virtual one
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love the game but hate the intentional stops by the app when you are on a roll.  Would love to go as far as I can.  So annoying.<br />Love the addition of using bolt.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Perhaps the biggest reason that Rodriguez was not the big success in the U.S. during the early 1970's is because he didn't sell out. He is a man of strong convictions and it is very cool to see him resurface.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is a great CD and I would definitely recommend that you buy a copy of this. Gill and Franklin totally nail the &#34;Bakersfield&#34; sound.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|The boys from Hanson are all grown up.  I think they made a good choice leaving their old record company to pursue more growth in their music.  This is one of the few pop CD's to come out recently that actually uses real instruments!  These guys show real talent and good musical taste.  It is a fun CD that you can also be proud to own.

B008I43DYU|4.0|Would be helpful if instructions on how to use memory keys had been included. Also the color combinations is a bit hard to get used to.
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|Most album reviews have to answer just one question - is it a good album? This one has to answer two questions; the above, and secondly, \\"is it a Chimaira album?\\" The answer to both is a resounding yes.<br />Although like any Chimaira album, this one takes time to grow on the listener, and rewards multiple listens, it is still clear right from the first listen that this is going to be a damn good album. It starts out with a few songs that are fairly true to Chimaira at their stripped down, rip roaring selves. Not derivative of themselves, but reminiscent. Letting you know that they are still Chimaira. The biggest difference you will hear at first is Emil's guitar solos. He definitely has his own unique style, and is very different from Rob Arnold, but it not only fits, it grabs your attention and sucks you right into paying closer attention.<br />When the album gets to Plastic Wonderland, at track 5, things get a little more adventurous. This is where the album really picks up, in my opinion. This is also, again in my opinion, the strongest song on the album. Remember the promise built up in the intro to No Reason to Live, off of Resurrection? This song is what that song could have been.<br />Up next is a short instrumental that builds into Crown of Phantoms. This instrumental could be a modern Metallica in its depth and beauty, as well as its ability to genuinely build anticipation for the title track that's coming up next.<br />Crown of Phantoms is in direct competition with Plastic Wonderland for best song on the album. It is a song that showcases the one thing Chimaira has always done best - give you a thick, fat, heavy groove, in the context of a genuinely well written, dynamic song. It seems these days so many bands go out of their way to avoid groove, while the ones who embrace a groove often do it in the most simplistic, pointless ways(insert 4/4 breakdown here, for example). Chimaira shows you that you can have an actual song, full of dynamics, and changes,while banging your head. Hard.<br />I won't get bogged down reviewing every song on the album, but latter-half songs Kings of the Shadow World, Wrapped in Violence, and Love Soaked Death are all amongst the strongest songs on the album, and worth the price of admission.<br />I must also strongly suggest you listen to this album on the best sound system you can. Crown of Phantoms is very well recorded and has a lot of sonic depth to it. This is not something to check out on crappy laptop speakers or your phone. If you have a powered subwoofer, or access to one, this album will take full advantage of it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|im addicted!! live pinterest...sometimes a little glitchy with pictures but with the new update its not a big deal!! get this app!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|really enjoyed season seven. less predictable, more character development. the last two had become too formulated. nice surprises in this season
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful entertainment.  Nothing off color and fun to get lost in makebelieve.  I am excited and eagerly anticipating the next season.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|Saw the movies.  Read the books.  Wanted to have the movies for my collection.  Now I have them all to watch whenever the mood strikes.
B00068TJM6|5.0|After hemming and hawing for months over different watches I finally took the plunge and purchased the SNA411, and I could not be happier with it.  Delivery was lightning fast (amazon prime) and the watch arrived in perfect condition.  This watch looks much better in person than it does in the single photo amazon provides, I reccomend looking at some reviews on youtube if you really want to get a feel for it before buying.  I have just started to wear watches again after a decade long hiatus resulting from using my cell phone, and this is my favorite so far.  I spent quite a while making the decision to purchase the SNA411, the market is chock full of chronographs with a broad spectrum of prices but this watch seemed to be the best combination of price and quality that I could find.  There have been some reviewers that have complained that this watch is too small, personally I think the case diameter is perfect. If you are looking for a giant case diameter that all the kids are wearing this is not the watch for you, personally I think those watches look cartoonish and cheep, and when the trend is over you will be left with a peice of scrap metal.  This watch is sized well for a mans wrist, its large without looking tacky or garish.  The adjustments are relatively easy to operate and being able to use the alarm dial as a secondary time zone is an extra bous and a worthwhile feature for those who travel.  I consider myself to be fairly picky (the wife says too picky) and I am really impressed with this time piece!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book helped me get through a very tough time in my life.... I really enjoyed the story as well as her considering- at times lyrical- writing.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Wont save. No matter what I do. Can alter pics but that doesn't matter If it wont save. So it gets a 1 star.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a really fun game wish there was a hint button because I've been stuck in level 4 for like 2 days after I get the flash light and then stick from the window I open one of the vents on the floor with the wine opener is dark and I try using the flashlight and doesn't help, any tips please
0765365278|5.0|I am a picky fan of fantasy and I couldnt be more pleased with the work Brandon has done here. This book is rich in imagination, and at 1001 pages it's good bang for your buck
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I.like this app the only bad side about the app is it takes a couple of minutes to boot up
0062255657|5.0|It only took a few hours to read, but it left a lasting impact.  This short novel from Gaiman is written in a voice that should be very familiar to fans, but a voice made more intimate by the personal connection the author has with the story.<br /><br />This is a must for fans and for anyone who, as a child, had more imagination than friends.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|All I wanted to do was read this book.  Morning before work and right after.  Totally consumed me.  Can't wait for more from this author
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|best coloring app ever its so awesome it has every Colorado you can think of it has stamps colored pencils crayons markers paint everything you can even send that picture to your gallery
B009UX2YAC|4.0|You can sometimes get tired of the same thing but other from that it is very fun for a pre -teen or even teenager
0385535139|4.0|I like this book. It held my interest.  Chareters interesting.  I had a hard time plowing through all the litigation prosedures  and so forth, but to be expected since the Title of the book warns me.  Like  John Grisham's books.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It's even better on the kindle. So much fun. every hour you can scratch to get free tokens so you don't have to pay. There are options to buy tokens if you want to though. You should totes get this !!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is considerably more difficult than your standard run-duck-dodge game. The added aspect of having to use your finger to dictate the minion's movements increases the skill level considerably. A thoroughly enjoyable game. Highly recommended.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I luv this app so much it is the best texting app ever... I luv texting all my friends on this app and sometimes I luv to text kik team wen I'm bored....
B00A285OOW|5.0|As a big fan of P Gregory I was not disappointed. The White Princess was great. I didn't want to stop reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm not that brilliant,but this game was the first I bought on my kindle,and it is great fun for playing against friends or by yourself.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Not an easy read, it must be read seriously, but worth every letter. Highly recommended and will be reading more from this author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's really fun I have it for my xbox360 and pc this needs to add Redstone but still awesome and portable
B009FBX5M0|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  I saw this at the movies and was excited to order it so I can watch it again.  I really enjoyed it.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|The deceptively simple classic strategy game, very well done on the android platform. This has been a free app of the day before and I got it the last time it was. It was 5 stars then and it's 5 stars now. Everyone has to have a copy of checkers, it is mandatory (lol) and this is an excellent version! Download with confidence.<br /><br />UPDATE (based on other reviews saying this game crashes, etc.):<br /><br />The complaints are interesting, as I've been playing this version for well over a year now relentlessly and I've never had a problem. I've also played some other AI Factory Limited games (Reversi and Chess in particular) and also have never had an issue. I'm not saying those reviews are wrong about it or anything, I just want to report that I personally have yet to run into these issues, at all, ever. Maybe the app just acts strange on certain devices? I've run it under Eclair (2.1), Froyo (2.2), Gingerbread (2.3.4), Honeycomb (3.1) and ICS (4.0.4) so far.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is to good for words.Seriously.Don't buy any other uno but this it is really addicting once you really get into it.Click that &quot;free&quot; button twice ;)
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchased these headphones at the recommendation of a friend. They are comfortable and feel sturdy. The ear cups provide a surprising amount of ambient noise reduction (nearly on par with a noise-cancelling pair I have from a company who's name rhymes with &#34;nose&#34;). Even without anything playing they help muffle out the sounds of a shared office.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Got hooked on this series the first night.  It is always suspenseful and can watch it over and over again and still see something I missed.  Looking forward for the 2 season to come out.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This novel surprised me and kept me reading. I felt invested in the main character and I enjoyed the structure of the novel.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Once again I'm a huge fan of these books they are awesome and very very descriptive it feels like you are in  the character's position that you are experiencing what they are experiencing you feel the fear that they feel and are in the same mind frame that they are in and that's what makes this book a book you'll<br /> never want to put down
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|You kind of have to figure it out to enjoy. Ho and other games...would buy full version. The silhouette ho can be hard. Overall, good game.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Worked very well until it was recently updated.  Everytime I try to pin I get an error message and the app closes down.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Visually a feast but poor plot line. I had to watch it a second time to figure out exactly how the story all fit together.
B00EH49DXA|1.0|Was sort of looking forward to her new one, but a huge disappointment. Definitely not worth your money. Go elsewhere for a hit than this. Not to mention it greatly sounds like \\"Brave\\" by sara bareilles
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun, addictive, and a reasonable challenge. Had to figure out the rules, though.  The hints need to be taken with caution since they are not necessarily the best move.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was the perfect gift for my 8 year old minecraft and Lego lover! He sat down immediately and out it together! Would recommend for kids that love minecraft and love Legos!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much more fun than subway surfers and the free version is only free because it has ads but this game is totally worthit if u don't like ads u can buy it then u get no ads
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I didn't like this game for my young kids. I wasn't impressed with running from the cops. I didn't know anything about the game when we downloaded it. My kids loved it but I just thought they were too young for this kind of game to influence them.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I truly enjoyed Cheryl's account of her life and hike of the PCT.  I loved her descriptions  of the characters she met and the scenery. I felt like I was there with her. This is definitely a must-  read for anyone who likes nonfiction adventure along with insightful reflections of the author's life.
