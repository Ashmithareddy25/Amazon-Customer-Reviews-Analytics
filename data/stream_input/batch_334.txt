B00006F7S4|5.0|Yeah beck is amazing.  This album rocks hard core and i'm not a normal beck fan.  I saw him live in Cali.  I think it was his last stop on the tour and it was AMAZING.  He is even better live and if you have a chance to see him when he comes back around.  GO!
0688170528|5.0|THE PACT by Jodi Picoult<br />This is my first book by Jodi Picoult, and I'd like to preface this review by saying I had no expectations whatsoever, but by the time I was done with the book, I was a fan for life.  This was one hell of a book.  It started with a bang: young Emily Gold is dead, and by her side was her boyfriend and close childhood friend, Chris Harte.  As life-long friends, Chris should've been there to save Emily, but obviously he was not able to, and now their parents are asking, \\"what really happened\\"?<br />THE PACT is not only the story of two families torn apart by the death of one of their children, but it is also the story of a young girl who for reasons that are revealed in the book, has no reason left to live.  As the story unfolds, the reader knows that Emily died of a gunshot wound to her dead.  The police are not sure whether this is a suicide or a murder.  Regardless of what the charges are, the parents of both teens are distraught and are now trying to figure out why this happened, and if there was anything they could have done to prevent it.<br />The story then goes into flashbacks, with scenes from their childhood depicted with Emily and Chris being the best of friends since the day they were born.  The two were months apart, and the two families started their friendships before the two were even born.  No two families could have been closer than the Golds and the Hartes, and so it is shocking to see how their friendship is torn apart by the death of Emily.  Friends accuse friends and friendship turns to hatred, as the two families learn about what happened that night Emily died.<br />As the plot follows their pasts into the present, Chris is charged with the murder of Emily, and it is from here that the story line really takes off.  A book that can be taken from today's headlines, the murder trial is sensationalized and causes the little town of Bainbridge, New Hampshire to become the center of the universe as tabloids and newspapersdetail the murder trial.  <br />And with that said, I highly recommend THE PACT.  I can't say anymore about this book, which I found riveting and literally could not put the book down.  It will most likely be on my top 30 list of books read in 2003.
0553274503|5.0|I read this for English last year. At first, I didn't understand what was going on in the book, but once it hit me....I was hooked. To see Charlie go from ... to genius was incredible. There was so much detail, so many hooks and catches....it was one of the best books I have ever read. However, I did cry at the end...how can you not? I 100% recommend this to any and everyone!
B00008GKEG|5.0|This Apple masterpiece is really great. I couldn't buy the VHS version on the past because it was unavailable on the market. This DVD version is really good, with all the advantages this technology has, and with a very good price.<BR>If you are a BEATLES fan you will have everything if you buy this box-set. Every footage, every clip is included here; and narrated by THE BEATLES.<BR>The picture quality is great, as well as the sound and the features this DVD has.<BR>I really look forward for the remastered version of LET IT BE!!!<BR>BEATLES FOREVER!
B00008OLYN|2.0|Old school Opeth fans would not have expected this.  I certainly didn't.  While the bands musical talents are definately showcased in this album it most certainly isn't something I wanted to spend my &quot;death metal&quot; money on.  I have come to expect classical interludes and clean vocals in Opeth albums but I didn't want an entire album of easy listening music.  I'm a huge fan of Opeth (and Bloodbath) and I appreciate all good music but have to say that I was expecting and/or hoping for something with a punch.  Opeth did not deliver the sounds an old school Opeth fan would expect on this album.
B000002G7G|5.0|Mercurial without being alienating, enigmatic without being esoteric, syncretic without sounding disparate, jaded but with a fantastic sense of humour and absurdity...This is what happens when a band is so confident in it's own talent that it knows it doesn't have to convince anyone else...and just has fun. <BR>Soft, sad, and subdued as this album is, there is an inherent sense of affirmation (of what is a subjective choice) that threads it's way through the emotional labyrinth of this album. From the wistful &quot;Candy Says&quot; to the chilling, hymn-like &quot;I'm Set Free&quot; to the mordant (yet strangely unpretentious) wit of &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot; to the surprisingly vulnerable intimacy of &quot;After Hours,&quot; this Lou Reed and his Velvets at their melodic best. No, it's not perfect, but it's flawed in the best kind of way...its been a steadfast fixture in my admittedly ever-changing music collection. It has a subtly hermetic atmosphere...just let it envelope you.
B000026FOA|5.0|Five Leaves Left is Nick Drake's first Album, and in my opinion his best.  Singing with the gentlest voice I have ever heard, he could make any song into a beautiful serenade.  His musical accompaniment matches his vocals with such precision that it's like he is singing the whole song.  The opener, \\"Time has Told Me\\", contains all the beauty of Nick Drake.  It is a timeless song that in 200 years will still resonate with Drake's hauntingly beautiful and despaired voice.  But, that can be said for most any song of Drake's.  My favorite tracks (although I love them all) are: The first of course, Three Hours, Way to Blue, Day is Done, and the final one Saturday Sun.  Saturday Sun is a beautiful track led by piano and vibraphone, and it captures the sentimentality Drake was feeling as he wrote the song.  It is the perfect conclusion to his album and could make the oldest of men cry at its beauty.

0790732254|2.0|This movie was acted with passion and talent, the direction and writing show genious, but would you ever want to watch it again?  No.  This is a dark and disturbing picture of what a marraige can turn into when you let everything spiral downwards and yet it's more complex than that (it definitely feels more like a play than a movie).  The funny thing for me was that no matter how horrible Elizabeth Taylor's character, no matter how drunk, rude, and braying she was, and despite the fact she was looking older, I could still only look at her and admire how stunningly beautiful she was.  I'll admit this film had some merit, but I never want to see it again.  I rank it in the same category as Vertigo and possibly The Country Wife - masterful yet too disturbing to want to watch over and over (although I would like to see Country Wife again if it ever comes out on DVD).  As far as the DVD goes, someone else already mentioned that you'll have to turn your TV almost up to full volume because of the transfer.
B00005JLTN|3.0|first....the last thing on the screen before the credits was<br />To be Continued<br />why didn't anyone tell me? setup for a 6 month wait. just like the \\"lord of the rings\\" trilogy.<br />guess the cliffhangers add to the bottom line.<br />second, i like science fiction, read lots when i was a kid, never grew up as a result. so even a bad sci-fi interests me.<br />And this isn't bad. Needs to be seen in order with the first part however, too much continuity depends on it. plus character development.<br />The underlying philosophy is delivered via soliloquy, neither very subtile, nor a particularly interesting way. I expect better from well paid sci-fi writers, see \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"StarWars\\" for much better, under-the-mental-radar way of introducing complex philosophic themes. It's a shame, the lead idea, choice and the difference it makes is a big issue (see something like for the loss of a horse shoe the kingdom was lost). Human destiny and freewill are complex issues, not just for philosophy or religious textbooks but for good sci-fi, sadly this does injustice to the complexity of this issue. It is not a matter of two doors. no, needs more thinking work before the scripting of the fights.<br />Likewise the new theme, akin to the Buddhist great wheel of life, revolving in big cycles, redoing, renewing, re-rolling, is introduced in the white room with the maker soliloquy. It answers a few questions, asks a few more, but heavy handed, being far too verbal. Now NEO as superman, as prophet, as ultimate decider for the fate of the human race is a nice touch, but inadequate background was laid. The scenes in Zion with him as a revered figure and the dance scene were well done and up to the standard of the best in sci-fi, but they could not pull the whole weight of the movie.<br />So all in all, an ok movie, but not in the class of the very best in sci-fi, but why should it be, in the last analysis it is little more than a kungfu movie with a good plot set in the dystopic future, but i'd prefer \\"black rain\\" or \\"bladerunner\\" in this genre.pic future, but i'd prefer \\"black rain\\" or \\"bladerunner\\" in this genre.
0142004235|5.0|The ability of John Steinbeck, to place 'you' the reader psychologically into the story is the true power of his artistic gift. You 'feel' the characters. You 'see' the unfolding and changing landscape. You are emotionally pulled into the unfolding drama. You laugh at outrageous hilarity. You cry over intense sadness. You literally feel the rain on your face when he alerts you to a storm blowing in.<BR> <BR>For the most part, the characters spanning several generations are biographical depictions of his real relatives; mostly on his mothers side. The only weakness in the novel that I feel worth mentioning is that the character Kate appears too mean, inhuman, and damaged to seem real.<br />John, in a paragraph or two using real nonfictional characters, actually puts himself into the story by name at two different times. The first is when he and his sister Mary at around age 10 or 11 discuss a very funny situation with their Uncle Tom at a Thanksgiving dinner. The second time he appears in the story is again with his sister Mary where they are depicted as peeking out of a second story window down upon a visitor walking up to their house in Salinas. <BR>   <BR>The existential theme of &quot;individual choice&quot; being more fundamental than &quot;Heavenly Mandates&quot; is a topic he repeats often causing one to believe that John himself must have believed this to be an important idea. But he also demonstrates that choice itself is often not powerful or useful enough to provide solutions to complex tragic situations.<br />This novel is a must read. But then again, I believe that any of his novels will not disappoint.
0060523794|2.0|As I recall, the title originates from the time that IBM wanted to market its Personal Computer. As the goal was to do that in a minimum amount of time and effort, a very unlike IBM approach was followed: operating software was obtained from a whizkid, who copied existing code and modified it; hardware components, except for the solid keyboard, where ordered from outside manufacturers. All IBM did was assembling it.<BR>One IBM executive at the time said that eliphants can't dance, as he did not believe this approach would be feasible. At the introduction the PC was demonstrated to him with a dancing elephant on the green monitor screen.<BR>Since then IBM gradually lost grip on the market ending to almost a disaster in the beginning of the 90's, when Gerstner was hired to save the company. And he did save it. Not by breaking it down into components, but keeping it together and promoting the immense power of having all expertise in one company, that in his view should literally fight a war against competition to survive.<br />The best article describing Gerstner's view on the tasks he had to fulfil for IBM were in Times Magazine, of which I found no reflection in his book, unfortunately. Perhaps, he'd better hired a ghost writer, afterall.
B00005JMFR|2.0|This review is based on the theatrical screener.<br />Revolutions is certainly a departure on the theme of the first two Matrix films. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't yet seen Revolutions, but expect less philosophic puzzles and more special-effects action. I felt that the script was 'dumbed down' a tad too much for my liking - obviously in response to negative feedback from Reloaded.
0375805613|5.0|When we had our daughter last year, my parents gave me a box of MY childhood books, to share with her. In it was the \\"Little Golden Book\\" version of The Monster at the End of This Book. Caroline grabs it every day, and my husband and I love to do the silly voices when reading it to her.<br />Well, I saw in the bookstore one day that it is still being sold! And in \\"board book\\" version! I have bought several as gifts already, and will continue to do so. It's a guaranteed good time for kids AND parents!
B0000013GT|5.0|I bought this c.d. years ago before I'd even heard of them, and it remains one of my all-time favorite and most-played cds. The versatility of Outkast is so evident when comparing ATLiens to their previous album, the debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, which is full of fat southern \\"crunk\\" beats, and really follows the dirty south style. This LP represents an amazing evolution in sound and style, and the futurisitic beats are both addictive and really unique. The great thing about Outkast is that all of their albums sound so different, but this one remains my favorite. From the smooth melodic Jazzy Belle to the rawer tinny beats of Two Dope Boyz, this album is innovative not only for Outkast, but for hip-hop as a whole. If this came out this year instead of 1996, it would be no way outdated. People who started their Outkast appreciation after Ms. Jackson or even Rosa Parks are truly missing out on their best work.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|Visually inconsistent. Doesn't have the overall theme, consistency and scope of Moulin Rouge. But Strictly Ballroom has more heart and less corn - very charming. The dancing is very romantic - don't be put off by the fact that's it's about ballroom dancing. It's just a crazy counterpoint to the sweet love story. The two leads are very appealing, and everyone else is plum looney. A bit dark, and low key, but very nice.     <br />If you are a huge Moulin Rouge fan, check this out to see what Baz carried over to that film.

B00005JKZU|1.0|Sure, this movie is absolutely fantastic, but that doesn't mean you're going to buy this marketing ploy, does it?<br />No, what you want to do is wait until November 18th, when they release the Platinum Extended Edition. This version, has four disks, like 10 hours of bonus stuff, comentary, and all that good stuff. But, even if you're into that extra stuff, the feature itself has been extended.<br />That's right. If you wait 3 months to get the platinum edition, the actual movie itself has been EXTENDED by over 1/2 hour. Instead of having a deleted scenes feature, Jackson has finished up those scenes, and seamlessly re-intergrated them into the film (in some instances, this meant a re-write of the soundtrack).<br />All of this sound familar? That's because they did the same thing with Fellowship last year, and they'll be doing it again with \\"Return of the King\\" next year no doubt.<br />This first release is just a sucker marketing ploy, the studio knows dumb people will go out and buy it, unaware that a MUCH better version is only a 3 months away. Quite clever really, staggering the releases of the DVDs just gets them more money from dumb people.<br />In conclusion;<br />- Don't be dumb.<br />- Wait for Platinum on Nov 18th.<br />- Fanatastic Movie either way (probably move fantastic with 30+ minutes of new footage though)
B000067DNC|5.0|Season Two delves deeper into the character of each player and furthers the story of the battle against the Goa'uld. The overall story arc is advanced, as well. While still skimpy on &quot;special&quot; features, I was less interested in these than in the fact that this series is available on DVD. And it is presented in the &quot;letterbox&quot; format, or mor correctly, the now increasingy popular (in preparation for HDTV dimensions) 16x9 aspect ratio. So, yes, there are black &quot;bars&quot; at the top and bottom of the screen. They &quot;disappear&quot; as you watch the shows and are not an issue with me. I like letterboxing. The images are crisp and clean to my eye. A more picky person will probably find flaws in the transfer and digitizing of the images, but they are hard to satisfy to begin with. The sound is good, too (though I do not have 5.1 surround to test that feature). If you have Season One, the layout here will be familiar as they have remained consistent in presentation menu screens to access the episodes. If you like the series, support it and buy these to let them know they are doing something right.

B000059TPN|5.0|First of all, how can you fo wrong with Nick Cage, and Connery anyway? If you're like me, and you're the &quot;plot? I just want explosions!&quot; kinda guy, then you'll love this movie. But, if you're reading this, you've probably already seen the movie, and made up your mind.<br />In terms of DVD transfer, this release is fantastic. TONS of extras (I haven't even gotten around to all of them yet), and the sound/visual quality is up to par with the DVD standard.<br />So, if you like the movie, this DVD is a great buy - good movies, great extras, you get your money's worth.
B00000ILBK|4.0|&quot;Insurrection&quot; is underrated.  Some folks have impugned the movie because, despite a title like &quot;Insurrection,&quot; it wasn't dripping with political intrigue like the latter days of the DS9 show.  Thank God it's nothing so boring as that.  Despite a few moments of manufactured cheese (Picard's love interest), and some dramatic overacting by F. Murray Abraham as the villain, the movie is excellent, entertaining, and above all, the funniest TNG movie.<br />WHY YOU'LL LIKE IT: The story is entertaining and even contains a surprise twist subplot.  Like &quot;First Contact,&quot; a portion of the story revolves around relatively mundane events on a planetary setting, but there is no shortage of spacefaring action, including a visually stunning nebular battle sequence that should make &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; fanatics jealous.  Everyone from the core cast gets their screentime, but it's Data, Riker and Worf who are laugh-out-loud funny as they supply the most hilarious Trek movie dialogue since &quot;The Voyage Home.&quot;  If it weren't for &quot;First Contact,&quot; this would be the best TNG movie hands-down.<br />WHY YOU WON'T: Some folks mentioned that the plot is a little thin, and they're not entirely wrong.  &quot;Save the Space Amish&quot; isn't a great title, but that would more accurately describe the gist of the movie than &quot;Insurrection&quot; does.  F. Murray Abraham, as the movie's more-disgusting-than-creepy villain, isn't much of a presence.  The movie makes some social commentary about the &quot;forced relocation of indigenous populations&quot; (a la Native Americans) that gets old pretty quickly, but it's never lingered over very long so you only have to tune it out for a moment or so every now and again.  Picard's afore-mentioned love interest and Data's child pal get pretty old pretty fast -- don't hope they die, you'll only be disappointed.
B00008PX8P|5.0|As they say online, \\"OMG!!1!1!!!\\"<br />First of all, as you already know, Led Zeppelin is quite possibly the most influential and greatest band of all time.<br />From Jimmy Page's AMAZING 12-string guitar, to John Paul Jone's fantastic bass lines, and Bonham doing his 20 minute \\"Moby Dick\\" drum solos, and with Robert Plant doing ear-splitting vocals, it's not wonder these guys are still at the top.<br />The DVD does a fantastic job of showcasing their early work on Zep 1 & 2 (disc one) throughout their fame, and into their hayday, when they basically owned the world with their music.<br />The visuals on the 1st disc are a little under par for what you might expect for a DVD, but the year was 1970, and they were using only 60 mm film to record it, so it's actually pretty good. The audio though, more than makes up for it. These live performances - being able to hear and see them - unbelievable. Fantastic. Stairway to Heaven, last 3 minutes... Jimmy Page on double guitar = best thing you'll ever hear/see, ever.<br />If you're a fan of their music, why are you still reading this? Scroll up and click \\"add to cart\\", dummy.<br />And if you're not a fan, this DVD will definetly help you appreciate them, and understand why they are regaurded as the greatest band of all time.<br />Oh, and while you're at it. Go out and buy \\"Who the West Was Won\\" (the triple CD set, featuring all Live Zep, seperate from the stuff on the DVD -  same songs in most cases, but different performanes).<br />Both the DVD and the CD are fantastic, and watch/listen to them all the time. Go, click, buy them. Right now. Go. Stop reading.

B0000399WI|5.0|Drawing slightly on the themes in Alexandre Dumas' THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO (which is even coyly referenced in the film by one of the criminals as \\"Alexandre Dumb-A**\\"), THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is sure to renew your faith in modern filmmaking.<br />The plot follows the life-long friendship formed in prision between Andy (played so wonderfully by Tim Robbins that I had to go out and watch his other films-- note: this is his best) and \\"Red\\" (portrayed perfectly by Morgan Freeman, as usual).<br />Andy has been falsely accused of a crime he did not commit. He ends up serving a life sentance alongside Red, a sly criminal who can \\"get you anything\\", and the two develop a several-decade-long friendship. Andy was a smart banker before his arrest and helps the evil warden with his paperwork. Not to give away the plot or anything, but there is some definate LES MISERABLES influence in this movie as well. Not to say that it doesn't stand alone as an original work of wonderful writing and directing. The classic references only enhance the fulfilling story of friendship, faith, hope and perserverence. <br />This is simply a perfect film and will leave you close to tears, if not actually shedding them. For a Hollywood film, it doesn't try to keep the plot \\"on the safe side\\", shedding dark, uncomfortable subjects for shallower ones. This movie will teach you something, and that's a big compliment.
0553812173|5.0|I have read many of the best out there: Jones, Tolkien, Brooks, Martin, etc. I would put Erikson right there with these guys. Gardens of the Moon is a no-nonsense book where there is seldom a slow dowm in the action. I read 100 pages one night and simply could not believe what I had just read - I had to read it again the next night to make sure I didn't dream it! One warning: This book is not for those who like a simple plot. If that's you, don't read it. It is a big book with several story lines that pull together in the end. This makes it hard to follow sometimes but if you read on, the answers are there. Awesome book - cant wait to read the next one!
006109594X|5.0|After seeing this particular title and Patrick Robinson's other titles in the stores last year I decided to purchase them all based on the back cover descriptions.  Prior to reading \\"Nimitz Class,\\" I decided to check the other reviews to see how well the book was received and was somewhat disappointed to see that the majority of the reviews didn't hold this title in a particularly favorable light.  With this in mind, I opened the front cover and dove in!  <br />Much to my surprise and delight \\"Nimitz Class\\" is a well told Naval/Political thriller that is extraordinarily intriguing, the majority of the characters are compelling and the pacing of the novel is dead on accurate.  As to whether Patrick Robinson is a new Tom Clancy, I'm not sure about that but he certainly holds his own in \\"Nimitz Class\\" and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his novels.<br />At the very core of most successful writers list of Political/Military novels is a strong set of recurring characters.  With \\"Nimitz Class\\" Patrick Robinson has set the stage for his characters such as Vice Admiral Arnold Morgan, Director, National Security Agency who is the spitting image of someone in his position, gruff in a good natured sort of way, tough as nails and extraordinarily intelligent.  <br />The premise:<br />Deep in the Indian Ocean lies an American CVBG, Carrier Battle Group, a twelve warship group centered on the Nimitz class aircraft carrier, the USS Thomas Jefferson.  She is on routine patrol after successfully engaging in war games with another carrier battle group.  Suddenly several of the outlying ships take a massive airburst and huge waves, nearly capsizing a couple of the ships.  Once everything settles down and the captain of the USS Arkansas regains command and control he attempts to make contact with every ship in the battle group.  The main player in the group, the aircraft carrier can neither be reached through communications nor seen on radar.  He immediately takes his ship tothe carriers last known position only to find a high level of radiation and a couple of the ships that were close to her badly damaged.  A US aircraft carrier and the six thousand men and women aboard are gone...<br />In comes the main players of the novel as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Scott Dunsmore is notified who then takes it up to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joshua Paul and then on the President.  A meeting is called to discuss what happened or what might've happened to the carrier.  The Director of the National Security Agency, Arnold Morgan and a young Naval Intelligence officer, Lieutenant Commander Bill Baldridge whose brother just happened to have been the Captain of the USS Thomas Jefferson.  While the general consensus is that this was somehow an accident aboard the aircraft carrier, Bill Baldridge, a nuclear expert explains otherwise and leads them down the path of discovery...<br />What follows is nothing short of an outstanding Naval/Political thriller that is a true page turner.  At times, some of the text is somewhat clipped and the technical terminology is off a bit, both of which can be easily overlooked in the overall light of the plot which is thoroughly captivating.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of this genre!  {ssintrepid}
B00005JKCH|3.0|With this movie, director Sam Raimi assembles a great cast, then bafflingly fritters away their talents on an almost completely uninspired story and some wincingly bad visual effects.<br />Casting Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man might have seemed an odd choice at first, but it proves a masterstroke; his performance is hands-down the best (indeed only) good thing about this movie, and all three stars in this review go to him.  He is amazingly funny and sympathetic as the put-upon high school uber-dork Peter Parker, yet also graceful, buff, and lithe as alter-ego Spidey.  Parker/ Spidey is the only character with anything even remotely resembling depth.  The scenes where he realizes he has super powers (thanks to that infamous spider bite), experiments with them, and figures out what to do with them are probably the best in the movie, and he is given a nice personal motivation to propel him into a life as a vigilante crime-fighter.<br />Sadly, it all goes downhill from there.  Kirsten Dunst (with frightfully dyed red hair) is cast as his love interest Mary Jane Watson, but she literally has nothing to do in the movie except get in trouble, scream, and be rescued (and this from a director who co-created Xena?).  Here and there, she and Maguire have scenes where they actually talk to each other and exhibit chemistry; some of these are good, some are painfully laborious.  Check out Bring it On for evidence that Dunst can do a lot more; that she can breathe any life at all into her two-dimensional character is a testament to her talent.<br />The biggest disappointment is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/ Green Goblin who is so flat and badly done and over the top that trying to watch his scenes is just excruciating.  I found myself glad I had waited to rent this movie on DVD and could therefore fast-forward over his scenes.  Raimi indulges in every stupid villain cliche in the book, from the greedy military-industrial scientist to the ridiculous costume/ mask design to the rocket-propelled surfboard to his Evil Maniacal Laugh--he is the kind of villain spoofed pretty much every week on Kim Possible.  When he actually started singing \\"The Itsy Bitsy Spider,\\" I just about threw rotten tomatoes at my TV screen.  The Jekyl-and-Hyde dual personality fails to give him any depth because both his human self and his monster self are completely lacking in charm, complexity, or plausible/ original motivation.<br />The supporting characters range from decent (Uncle Ben and Aunt May) to overbearing (the newspaper editor) to dull (Peter's best friend Harry); again, I found myself fast-forwarding through a lot of their scenes, never a good sign.  Overall, this movie suffers mostly from a profound lack of subtlety: everything is loud, forced, obvious, and dumb.  Many of the visuals disappoint: for example, the shots of Spidey swinging among the New York skyscrapers are about as organic-looking as an animated character in a video game.  There are a few fun moments, mostly early on, like some 'person-on-the-street' reactions to this new super-hero (a subway guitarist is particularly funny), but scenes like this are sadly fewer and further between as the movie plods its way through a hackneyed and totally predictable plot.  With a better story and a fresher vision, this movie might have been achingly good, but Raimi and scriptwriter David Koepp seem determined to reach for the lowest common denominator rather than something even a little higher.<br />Almost every member of the cast can be seen in better work.  For those wanting an eyeful of Maguire, rent the far superior Pleasantville, or better yet, check him out this summer on the big screen in Seabiscuit, a terrific movie that lets his substantial talents really shine.  I wince at the thought of him in Spider Man 2, which I fear will only be broader and dumber than its predecessor.

B0000640S2|3.0|I grew up with Rambo as a kid. Not FIRST BLOOD, the first movie, but this one. This was back in the 80's when R rated movies were aimed at kids and times were great. I mean, I had Rambo action figures. Nowadays, I'm twenty-four and I still get carded to see an R Rated movie. <br />Anyway, I just bought the DVD and I hadn't seen this movie in years. All I remembered was that I used to like it when I was young. Guess what? It's still cool. This is Sylvester Stallone at his very best (aside from COPLAND where he and everyone else were brilliant). First time viewers may have to take themselves back to the eighties to enjoy this one but this was some ground breaking action back in the day. <br />I also just realized that this was written by James Cameron too if that tells you anything. I guess when it came out originally I didn't even know who he was. If he's behind it then it has to be good right? Okay, forget SOLARIS, most of Cameron's stuff is quality. All in all, I liked this movie. It's a little dated but not much. I'm glad I bought it. Thanks Rambo. Thanks Trautman.<br />C+
B000022TSW|5.0|The Matrix mixed philosphy and action into a surprisingly great movie. South Park does the same, only it mixes intelligience and crude humor. Yes, there is cursing. Yes, there is crude humor - but behind the toliet jokes is an intelligent, well-written look at censorship and the ideas behind it.<br />Obviously this movie is not for everyone. If you don't appreciate or understand sarcastic humor or irony, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS. Unless, as Cartman says, &quot;you want your innocent little mind warped.&quot;
B00005JKN9|4.0|The only thing I had a problem with in the entire picture was Cameron Diaz. Sure, she's great to look at but what was the point of her character? The movie would move along much more nicely without her. <br />Great performance by Daniel Day Lewis and Irish actor Brendan Gleeson (28 DAYS LATER). <br />Overall, a good, worthy epic from director Martin Scorsese. I've seen it more than once. That's gotat say something right?
B00009ATIX|4.0|Despite it's criticisms, shortcomings, and comparisons to Andrei Tarkovsky version of the classic sci-fi novel; Steven Soderbergh's flawed, but nevertheless stylish, interpretation of Stanislaw Lem's novel is a feast for the eyes and the mind.  George Clooney plays Chris Kelvin; a psychologist who is sent to a space station orbiting an alien planet to find out what has happened to the crew members of the station, which has since lost contact.  When he arrives, he learns that a crew member has committed suicide, and the two surviving crew (Jeremy Davies and Viola Davis) are experiencing some rather strange phenomina.  Soon enough, Kelvin begins to be visited by the image of his dead wife (Natascha McElhone), and we learn that this mysterious planet can reach into your most painful memories and make them real.  Solaris' problems lie within Soderbergh's screenplay; his subtlety is good to a point, the film implies more than it should explain, and the ending is too happy of an ending and is superbly disappointing.  All that aside however, Solaris is criminally underrated, and despite it's many flaws, it is still an incredible piece of film that outshines many of the over the top glossy Hollywood product that is way too abundant today.  Clooney is surprisingly superb, and McElhone gives the finest performance of her career in a role that many actresses would have a difficult time doing.  Yes it's purposely slow moving.  Yes, it can be confusing.  Yes, maybe it would have been better off in James Cameron's hands.  But all things considered, Solaris turned out better than I could have hoped.
B000099T3P|4.0|It's still amazing to me how many little monster movies Hollywood churned out after the success of GREMLINS. You had MUNCHIES, you had GHOULIES and you had CRITTERS, which surprisingly enough turned out to be the best of the bunch. Not that I have anything against GREMLINS but CRITTERS has far more depth and character development than it does and it's leagues above the other two. <br />Directed by Stephen Herek, who would later go on to helm BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE and ROCK STAR with Mark Wahlberg, CRITTERS is a sci-fi/horror/comedy about a group of fur-ball aliens who escape from a prison space ship and come to Kansas for a bite to eat with a pair of intergalactic Bounty Hunters, who can take the face of nearly anyone they want, on their trail. Now as ridiculous as it all may sound, the characters are genuine and the family, along with Charlie, is real enough that you will end up caring about them by the time it's all over. <br />Still, in the end though CRITTERS is nothing more than campy fun but it's campy fun that will keep its viewers entertained. Check it out. You'll see what I mean.<br />B-
B00005JKC3|4.0|This movie is great! I wasn't even a big Hulk fan before watching it, but I was quickly converted by the film's excellent story telling and excellent cast. This film is definately noy a Spider-Man clone, as many people who saw it thought it would be, and it is definately a comic book film for older people. There is a much more complex and detailed story here than there was with Spider-Man, and I think it works excellent. The special effects are top-notch, and I think that this film deserves a spot on your shelf right next to X-Men, Spider-Man, and Daredevil.
B00009L1TA|4.0|BASIC has taken a lot of beatings by critics and such. I'm not really sure why. This is a great whodunit film. It's the first film like it that I haven't been able to figure out before the movie reveals all it's cards since I can't remember when. <br />This is also the first time I have liked John Travolta since FACE/OFF. That John Travolta has been missing from film for to long. With BASIC, once more, he has regained his cool. <br />BASIC is a good, solid thriller with an amazing cast. So check it out and watch close. I guarantee you can't figure out what's what before the movie lets you in on the secrets iself.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I didn't get around to watching this film until after I had already seen Terminators 2 and 3, however it did manage to impress me none-the-less, and I was amazed at how much James Cameron and company managed to do with a bare-bones budget. This film should definately inspire young film makers as to just how much can be done with such a small budget, and for those who were like me and saw all the Terminator films but this one, there's no time better than the present. There are some complaints I have with it, most of wich have to do with the fact that this is an 80's movie. The score, while having some decent themes, sounds very much like the cheap synthesizers you can buy in a department store. There's also the very dated 80's fashion and hairstyles wich will certainly make you chuckle more than once, but hey, the movie's supposed to take place in the 80's, so just think of it as being &quot;Historically accurate&quot;. There's also some adult oriented material in the movie, but there's nothing that can't be skipped over by a mute button and the fast forward and chapter skip buttons on your DVD remote, if you're offended by that kind of thing. The film is definately something that should be seen by sci-fi fans, casual T2 fans, and young film makers alike. The special features side of thes DVD 18 flipper are definately worth checking out, and there are two deleted scenes that I don't know why they didn't reincorperate into the actual film, because they add so much to the story and really set the stage for Terminator 2. There's also an excellent doccumentary and some other stuff, so yeah, this is a pretty packed set. It definately deserves a spot next to those T2: Ultimate and Extreme edition DVDs you have on your shelf.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I'll be honest, I have nothing against Ben Affleck but when I first heard he was going to don tights and play a super hero I thought it sounded ridiculous. However Mr. GOOD WILL HUNTING would soon prove me wrong.  DAREDEVIL is anything but ridiculous. It's a helluva a good time and Affleck is very good in the role of the red-horned avenger. <br />Knowing pretty much nothing about DAREDEVIL from the comic books and not caring much for the over hype that was SPIDER-MAN, I didn't have very high expectations when I sat down at the theatre to watch this one. That soon changed. Fifteen minutes in I had already declared this the best super hero film I'd ever seen. This isn't SPIDER-MAN. It's much more real, much darker. Not to mention that it has one of the best villains to grace the screen for the past decade in the form of Bullseye who is brilliantly played by Colin Farrell. Farrell just seems to be having so much fun with the role. You want him to get what he has coming but at the same time he's so much fun to watch. <br />Anyone who hasn't seen DAREDEVIL should definitely give it a look no matter what their reservations may be. Director Mark Steven Johnson has done an amazing job. I've seen a lot of movies this year (of all types and genre) and DAREDEVIL still stands out as one of the best. I can't wait for the sequel. Excellent!<br />A-
B00005JM09|4.0|Despite all the bad wrap this movie recieved during it's production cycle, the final product definately is worthwhile. While I think Terminator 2 is still the best film in the series, this movie definately takes a close second. Arnold said he'd be back, and he most definately is. He still kicks major butt as the T-800 terminator, hardly looking a day older than he did in Terminator 2. Kristanna Loken is the sexy and deadly Terminatrix, and she definately looks like she's been one of the best kept secrets amongst movie actresses to show up in quite some time. Nick Stahl and Clair Danes are excellent in their roles as well. The action in the film is top notch, being rivaled only by The Matrix Reloaded, and the story told here is very good, even if it is lacking some of the magic that James Cameron had in the first two films. It's still an excellent addition to the series, and I eagerly await the release of the T3 DVD, as well as the inevitable announcement of Terminator 4.<BR>I can't wait till this film can join The Terminator: Special Edition and the T2: Judgment Day 2 disc set on my shelf.
0451167716|5.0|Romantic. Powerful. Just. Exciting. Philosophical. And more. The Godfather has it all. Its not just about the Mafia and the Italian community. Its about why men become what they are. And what makes them as human as anyone else. Its about what loyalty, principles, vengence, lust, love, fear are all about.<BR>The book starts of with a very detailed and well thought about introduction of all the characters. Except the Don himself. Vito Corleone. The whole book has to assimilated to really know what the Don is all about. There is very little detail about what the Don really thinks and believes in. There is very little known about what motivates him. The whole book is a testament to what the Don has built and what he is. And other characters go about describing him to us by what they speak about and what they do.<BR>The book is organized into 5 main parts. Book one gives us introductions and builds up to a great family dispute. At the end of book one we know the family structure and other details that are important to the whole book.<br />Book two talks about how the Don became the don and more importantly how he became the Godfather. This part has awesome details about how people react to fear, and how a threat is never uttered, and what people really are. The section where the don contempates the power of Fannucci gives you a glimpse of how the Don must've operated to get on top of all the New York Families.<br />Book three is extremely romantic and is a very good read. This is the section where Michael Corleone spends two years in exile in Sicily.<br />Book four gives us an insight into how Las Vegas works. This is unarguably the most boring part of the book. Takes away the pace from the narrative and is totally unnecessary. Couldve been removed. No wonder this part is not a part of the Godfather movies.  <br />Book five is about how Michael becomes Don Michael. This introduces new characters and finally the end itself tells us the crux of the book. You could actuallyread it as the journey of a young man from being a conscientious war hero to finally ending up as the most feared Mafia Chief in the country.<br />The book is full of delightful characters whose shades of gray have been very well brought out. There are attitudes of people that leave you wondering whether people could ever live like that. Death becomes cheap. Life's goals are ridiculously simple. Male chauvinism is taken to new heights throughout the book. There are glorious one liners like \\"Revenge is a dish that tastes best when cold\\". \\"You should always have friends that underestimate your virtues and enemies that overestimate your faults\\"......<br />A great book. My personal fiction favorite.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK computer is probably one of the best albums out there. I would warn those who would apprehesively judge the solemn melodies on this album as being &quot;un-dance-able&quot;. You can easily dance to radiohead, just not very quickly, or well for that matter. This is of no importance howevr because I can dance neither quickly nor well (nor at all for that matter).
B00008I8IF|4.0|There was a time, back in the late 80s and early 90s, that the Jayhawks were one of the better alt country bands.  Ever since the departure of Mark Olson (around 1997), the band has taken a turn towards more of a mainstream pop sound.  Rainy Day Music continues this trend.  The songs are listenable, perhaps even catchy, but the songs are not destined to become classics.  In my opinion, this CD is pretty good, but not nearly as good as, for example, Hollywood Town Hall.
B00009XITP|3.0|Like many others, I watched this movie only because of Colin Firth.  He doesn't disappoint.  Well, neither does the movie, because it's exactly what I expected it to be--a teeny-bopper<BR>chick-flick.  It reminded me a lot of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;--except Colin Firth is much more my idea of a dream dad than Brian Keith.<BR>It is a cute, harmless movie, and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Colin Firth is definitely leading man material.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Whether or not the AFI was right in calling Citizen Kane &quot;The best movie of all time&quot; is debatable, but it still stands as one of those essential movies that everyone has to see. Orson Welles, then young and precocious, displayed style and intelligence in Citizen Kane that revolutionized filmmaking, and the film might be considered groundbreaking more for it's technical accomplishments than the movie itself.<br />Welles directs himself as Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon whose life was often the biggest source of news around. &quot;Loved by millions, hated by just as many&quot; was his catchphrase. The movie follows his entire life, from childhood to death. It was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, a real-life newspaper tycoon. I have seen Citizen Kane so many times, and it is starting to feel dates, especially in the dialogue. But the performances from Welles and his Mercury Theatre group and the visual elements more than make up for that. As the documentary and commentary teach us (more on that in a minute), Citizen Kane was more of a techical accomplishment. Welles used camera tricks, montage techniques, and difficult shots that were, at the time, never before seen on the screen. The attention to detail that went into every scene illustrates the passion that Welles brought to the screen. It has rarely been matched by any movie made since.<br />For the 60th Anniversary, Warner has put together a terrific 2 DVD set. The obvious jewel in the crown is the 2 hours documentary titled &quot;The Battle over Citizen Kane&quot;, which not only tells the story of how the movie was made, but the lives of both Welles and Hearst. It is essential viewing to say the least. My second favorite extra is the Audio Commentary by film critic Roger Ebert. Love him or hate him, you can't deny his passion for movies and his almost encyclopedic knowledge of the subject. His commentary is full of fun facts and insight that made me look at Citizen Kane differently. The second commentary is by Peter Bogdanovich, a film scholar and Welles biographer. This one has it's moments, but it meanders at times. The Ebert one is the best. Rounding off the extras is an entertaining theatrical trailer and loads of storyboards, photos, and promos.<br />Citizen Kane will always be regarded as a masterpiece, and rightly so. This DVD set from Warner is a must have, and with the quality of the extras, expect to be spending a lot of time with this DVD. Essential.differently.

6305364648|5.0|Now might be a good time to check out \\"True Lies\\" once again, simply because most of the principles are in the news a lot these days.  After all, Arnold Swarzenegger is running for governor of California, Jamie Lee Curtis is getting great reviews for her work in the new version of \\"Freaky Friday,\\" a network has shown enough faith in Eliza Dushku to star her in a new television series \\"Tru Calling,\\" and Tom Arnold is hosting a sports talk show on television while being dissed by ex-wife Roseanne Barr as she prepares for her new reality show.  Of course, you have to wonder whatever happened to James Cameron, the director of this 1994 action comedy (my own guess is that the spirit of David O. Sleznick is whispering in Cameron's ear, \\"Okay, now that you're `King of the World' what are you going to do next?\\").<br />Arnold is Harry Tasker, a special agent for a super secret government organization, but his wife Helen (Curtis), thinks he is just a boring computer salesman.  While he is dealing with cracking a ring of international terrorists, she is looking for a little more excitement in her life.  Ironically, she thinks she has found this in a fast talking used car salesman who hits on lonely wives by pretending he is a secret agent.  Of course, the irony gets a bit more intense as the movie progresses and the chief attraction is that Harry is trying to save his marriage along with the free world.  If there is one lesson this film teaches, then it would clearly be the old adage that it takes two to tango.<br />This week my thinking is that \\"True Lies\\" is ultimate Arnold Swarzenegger film, combining the action of the \\"Terminator\\" films with the appealing comedy of \\"Kindergarten Cop.\\"  This is a film that is able to have it both ways when it comes to Arnold's cinematic persona, being faithful to his larger than life action sequences while also carrying off some tongue-in-cheek parody.  Meanwhile, Curtis turns in the second best performance of her career, which I can now say because I just saw her best in \\"Freaky Friday\\" this afternoon.  Tom Arnold has never been better an the second banana, which is something he probably knows, and Charlton Heston has a choice bit part as the head of the secret organization for which Harry works.  I have heard there is supposed to be a sequel to this film, which might be derailed by Arnold's candidacy (especially if he gets elected), but that might be just as well because a sequel could not be better than the original in this case.<br />Schwarzenegger movies will be on hiatus, at least in California, for the next couple of months.  Fortunately, the movies of actors running for political office are a lot more accessible today than they were went Ronald Reagan was running for president (Note: \\"Bedtime for Bonzo\\" is a very good B-comedy and primarily a joke to those who have not seen the film).  If you are thinking of watching a Schwarzenegger movie to mull over his viability as a political candidate, then \\"True Lies\\" seems the obvious choice.  As for me, I watched it again because I wanted to see more of the funny (and sexy) Jamie Lee Curtis, and Laurie Strode just does not suffice any more.say because I just saw her best in \\"Freaky Friday\\" this afternoon.

0688101364|5.0|Like many of you out there in review land, I bake a couple thousand or so cookies each Christmas to give as gifts.  Usually round about September, friends and relatives start asking me if I'm going to bake the ones that are their particular favorites, whatever those might be.  As a veteran cookie baker, I can't say enough good things about this book from Rose Levy Beranbaum.  First of all, there is a large, full color glossy of every single cookie in the book.  So you know exactly what they should look like.  Secondly, she not only gives you very, very explicit measurements in both cups and grams, but her directions are quite thorough and well-explained.  Then she tells you exactly how to store each kind of cookie, and how long it keeps.  This is really helpful to me, since I bake about a dozen different kinds of cookies for gifts between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This way I can bake the cookies that keep the best first, and work my way toward the more fragile ones toward the end. <br />It's hard to imagine how anyone might have failed with any of these recipes.  They're fabulous, and guaranteed to win you popularity, if not outright love. <br />Some of my favorite ones from this book have been the Swiss Lebkuchen, the  Peanut Butter Jewels, the Lemon Bars, and the Melting Moments.  The Lemon Bars are a lot more work than the usual version of this cookie -- you have to pre-bake the shortbread crust, cook the lemon curd, then combine the two and bake, but it's well worth it -- by far the best lemon bar I've ever made or eaten.  The Melting Moments cookie, a fragile meltaway covered with high-quality dark chocolate is my personal favorite. <br />The only thing in this book that didn't work for me was the gingerbread for the gingerbread house.  I won't go into the lengthy and hilarious story of how my kitchen-challenged friend and I tried to make a gingerbread house with our friends the 6 musician-brothers (also not cooks) -- but it was an unqualified disaster!  Thewhole thing just fell apart endlessly.  However, considering the glory of all the other recipes in the book, I'm quite sure that we did something wrong, and that the fault does not lie in the recipe.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I am one of those odd girls who when they go to see a movie, actually pays close attention to the music. I can't help it, I love movie-music. Anyway, the first time I saw this movie, as soon as that theme started, with Jack (Johnny Depp) on top of that sinking boat, I was in love. With Jack, of course, but the music was so vibrant and loud and absolutely perfect that I fell in love with it as well. I've listened to the soundtrack at least seven times. I am not one to sit still and listen to a whole CD, even if it is my favorite, so that really tells you something. It is an awesome piece of music. Buy it. Now.
6305342768|3.0|Ok, so this sci fi movie isn't great.  But, on the good side, it isn't too bad either.<br />I like the concept of Disney writing this movie where Ernest Borgnine,Yvette Mimeux,Anthony Perkins are on a mission to chart a black hole in 2130.<br />Personally, I like the whole idea of the scientist Max Schnell, wanting to take the crew into the black hole.<br />The ending was great. Some people don't get it. Too cereberal for them I suppose. Ok, it isn't 2001. It isn't supposed to be.<BR>This movie needs to be judged on its own. And when it is, it's pretty good.<br />Aside from the dialog, and the cute robots, the story is good.
1400034779|5.0|Ah, what a book. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was so intriguing with all the different detective cases Mme Ramotswe had to deal with. Each one more mysterious than the one before. <BR>Mme Ramotswe is a remarkable character whom is able to stay calm at all situations. She is cool, and extremely astute in solving her mysteries. Plus, she is not like other women main characters. Instead of being beautifully thin, she is fat. Instead of being blonde and white, she is African. And instead of being in her 20s and drive a fancy car, she is in her late 30s and drives a big white van. Even with these traits, she was able to get 4 proposals in the book. She is quite the inspirational character with all the things she was able to overcome, such as miscarriage, an abusive husband, etc...and shows women that they can do whatever they want even in a &quot;male-dominated&quot; society (even make a detective agency).  <BR>That is why I give this book 5 stars. It's fully entertaining with some jokes as well. <BR>Read it. You will enjoy it.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I liked this movie a lot, it was probably my second favorite film from 2002. It had a good story, great action, and it was smart. I think the Bond films are too stylized and outlandish, while this was not only a more realistic spy film but also enjoyable to watch. I gained a lot of respect for Matt Damon, as he was very effective and according to the DVD extras, he did his own stunts. Speaking of the DVD, it has an excellent presentation and a few good extras (Moby video and commentary in particualar). Chris Cooper is excellent, as always. Some people think it veers away from the books too much, however I haven't read those yet. As a film, it definitely stands on it's own feet. And if the books are better than the movie, than they must be great books so I'll check those out also.

B00000064G|5.0|It's actually kind of funny to read the negative reviews of this album.  One claimed that the guitar playing was &quot;simple&quot;.  HA!  If you play the guitar, you know that his songs are far from simple to play.  Another claimed that the only reason people are listening to Nick Drake so much lately is because he (arguably) killed himself.  I bought Pink Moon about 3 months ago after hearing a Nick Drake song on the internet (no, not &quot;Pink Moon&quot;) and honestly, I thought he was still alive.  Without knowing anything about him, his songs spoke to me so clearly and Pink Moon easily made it's way into my top 10 albums of all time.  I didn't get into Nick Drake for any other reason than the fact that his music is thoroughly amazing and full of beauty.  Now, I am completely obsessed and have read up on all I can about him.  It was only after hearing all three albums that I learned he was this depressed and frustrated soul, and honestly that doesn't make the music any better or any worse for me.<br />Buy this CD, and let the music fill your soul.  Listen to the songs for what they are and don't try to put labels on everything.  Nick's music speaks for itself.  His personality and life should have nothing to do with how you listen to these songs.
B00005NI5Y|1.0|I have been listening to Dylan since 1965. He has been a big part of my life. I am not a casual listener. I hate this record. It's worse than Time Out of Mind. Bob should give it up while he still has some sense of respect for his listeners. If he was unknown, no one would pay a dollar to see him live or buy his recent recordings. He is a living legend and he should retire as soon as possible. What passes for singing is just a bit of a joke, really.  Before long you won't be able to tell him from Tom Waits...and I never thought things would get THAT bad.<br />Bob, leave us with our memories of your greatness and stop parading your decline for all to see. Only the most toadying and undiscrimibating of sycophants (or the deaf) could call this &quot;singing&quot;.

What Lewis describes here is exactly that - an organization managed by fact and some very candid successes and failures with this approach.  Insightful reading for anyone in a similar environemnt (or anyone interested in creating such an environment!).<br />As a note, I agree whole-heartedly with the previous comments on this title - even if you don't like baseball, you'll find yourself more interested (and perhaps more respectful) in the sport.
B00005JMD3|4.0|Based on the 1970s TV series, S.W.A.T. is a great story with just enough action to keep you going, without overdoing it.<br />Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) are partners on the Los Angeles Special Weapons and Tactics team. When a successful hostage rescue results in a lawsuit for the department, hot-head Gamble quits the force while Street accepts a demotion, hoping for a 2nd chance. That 2nd chance comes in the form of Lt. Dan \\"Hondo\\" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson), a departmental war horse assigned to restore the division's reputation. He hand-picks a new team with Street as its top dog. The other members include Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez of Blue Crush and The Fast and the Furious); David \\"Deek\\" Kay (Rapper L.L. Cool J); T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles of Dead Poet's Society); and Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt of Basic and Windtalkers). Throughout their training period, we get to know a bit about each team member. Their individual personalities really come to life.<br />Meanwhile, a French criminal kingpin named Alex Montel, played by Oliver Martinez (\\"Unfaithful\\"), is caught and imprisoned, and offers $100 million to anyone who can help him escape. The Team is now up against a bunch of money-hungry LA mercenaries which will include some familiar faces.<br />Great action movie. Naturally, most scenes are stolen by the legendary Samuel L. Jackson and the young, hot, Irish actor Colin Farrell. But the other team members shine as well and add so much to the team and the film. Definitely worth it.

It builds its momentum to a climax.<br />I enjoyed it a lot.

Born into a blue collar family, Rudy was expected to follow in his father and brothers footsteps at the local steelmill and did until a tragedy enticed him to follow his dreams. Facing incredible adversity, through sheer determination, Rudy shows his father played by Ned Beatty and all those who said he could'nt, he can. After finally gaining admission to Notre Dame, he gains the respect of all those who touched him. Set in the 70's with most of the filming on the campus of Notre Dame, this is a must see for all those who ever doubted themselves. One of my all time favorites that everyone should see. I still find it hard to believe this film was never nominated for any awards. A true masterpiece!! Released in 1994 by Tristar  Pictures,                Running Time: approximately 113 minutes
0226264211|2.0|This master of the neoliberal cause offers nothing new in this book, in truth a compilation of a bunch of lectures given by the author back in the sixties!!!<br />IF Friedman is naive enough to think that private enterprise is the answer to all of us, he must be crazy. If he thinks that the big corporations are interested in prosperity for anyone eles beside themselves, you're living in a dream world. Well, the recent lack of energy in New York and CHicago is a good example...<br />THis book is bul...it...Only that.
0671027387|4.0|I have a strong belief, no matter what Dan Brown writes, it will always be good! With that said, \\"Deception Point\\" did not disapoint, however at the same time it did not amaze like his other stunning thrillers. I read his books in a semi backwards sequence, starting with \\"Angels & Demons\\" and then reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", followed by this book. I was so used to his writing in his last two novels, a politically based thrilller seemed out of the ballpark for Brown. But as mentioned before, he really beats most of his fellow writers in this genre.<br />The story has it's fair share of holes, however at the same time it shares many glorious moments as well. Brown has a knack for excellent character development, making every person in the story a part of you by the time you're done reading. This novel at times can seem far - fetched and unrealistic, but the research that was done for this and all of his books makes it some how believable nonetheless. The only change in \\"Deception Point\\" which made me a little upset was that I felt the ending would be more potent, more unbelievable. In reality, the shocking ending came 100 pages too soon.<br />This book recieves only four stars when compared to his other stellar books, but would easily recieve a five star rating if I had never read a Brown thriller before. I am still however utterly in love with \\"Angels & Demons\\" and am always speechless when talking about it. Go out and read any Brown book, it's well worth it!!
1582432678|5.0|At first, I thought this was a work of nonfiction, I was taken in by the reference to several actual school shootings in Eva's letters. I am a mother and was drawn to the story from the moment I read the front flap. I stayed up until 1am reading the book, I couldn't put it down. The last few chapters left me in tears and I found it hard to sleep. I went to give my son a kiss and was thankful for his 3-year-old personality. It has changed my way of looking at motherhood, at the moms of not just the victims, but also the perpetrators. <BR>We shouldn't judge women and label them weird, wrong or inferior just because they don't have that maternal instinct. Maybe we should be grateful that some of them don't cave into society's pressure (and their significant other's) to have a child. <BR>I am glad I wanted to be a mother and after reading this book, I know I will look at the relationship between myself, my son and his father (my husband) a lot different.

B000002VEP|5.0|With this smoother, deeper and even religious-flavoured album the Alan Parsons Project culmined a superb string of 10 records that made history in Symphonic Rock. The concept about it is the life of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi that was a very misunderstood artist and is curiously been studied by the Vatican for beatification. Alan Parsons said on a review that they studied Gaudi's life and they wanted to make a record with the type of music they guessed he would like.<br />'La Sagrada Familia', with its long introduction that adds a speech from Alan Parsons, many sounds like horses, helicopters and city sounds and a beautiful opening electric piano, lasts almost 9 minutes and is one of the biggest highlights from all the Project. The superb leading vocals of John Miles, the epic feel of either lyrics and orcherstrations and the great guitar work of Bairnson and Cottle on electric guitar and saxophone turn this song into a spectacular epic not so commercial or famous because of its length, but with as much quality as the best works from Pink Floyd or Dire Straits...<br />'Too Late' is for me the best Project song together with 'One More River' sang by the eccentric vocalist Lenny Zakatek. The song speaks about the anger of disappointment of a person speaking to other about their unbalanced relation. The prominent electric guitars and the superb distorted solo from Ian Bairnson make this song a perfect rocker full of power and quality.<br />'Closer to Heaven' is a beautiful ballad with a very original, pulsy rythm and a very sensitive singing by Eric Woolfson. Again the saxophone and guitar work together creating a wonderful and sublime instrumental part. Also, the beautiful accordions in the chorus add sentiment to the song.<br />The very synthesised and 80s sounding 'Standing on Higher Ground' adds a lot of freshness and rythm to the album. It is a song that goes in crescendo and includes a short but outstanding overdubbed guitars solo. The end is really intense and guitars and voices scream in a very enthusiastic and delirious mood.<br />The rocker 'Money Talks' is more disposable and predictable and speaks about the traps of money all we now in a too shallow way.<br />'Inside Looking Out' is a very sublime, almost heavenly ballad, showing I suppose some of the dreams and wanderings of Antonio Gaudi, with some beautiful words in the chorus:<br />'Now is the hour and the moment<br />Don't let the chance go by<br />Your ship is sailing with the high tide<br />And all your dreams are on the inside<br />On the inside looking out'<br />The last piece, 'Paseo de Gracia' is more than only the instrumental version of 'La Sagrada Familia'. The city sounds, synthesisers and church bells at the beginning create an atmosphere of either dream and reality, and the great flamenco guitar performance from Ian Bairnson add a last Spanish flavour to the album, the anecdote being they didn't know the historic and political difference of Catalonia and the rest of Spain at that moment, and the adding of castanets and flamenco guitar annoyed the Catalans a lot 'cos they felt it as a misunderstanding of their own musical and cultural traditions...<br />Apart from the anecdote, this is a great close for this record, that appears to any listener as a masterpiece and one of the best conceived and more serious Alan Parsons Project albums.e and guitars and voices scream in a very enthusiastic and delirious mood.<br />The rocker 'Money Talks' is more disposable and predictable and speaks about the traps of money all we now in a too shallow way.<br />'Inside Looking Out' is a very sublime, almost heavenly ballad, showing I suppose some of the dreams and wanderings of Antonio Gaudi, with some beautiful words in the chorus: <br />'Now is the hour and the moment<BR>Don't let the chance go by<BR>Your ship is sailing with the high tide<BR>And all your dreams are on the inside<BR>On the inside looking out'<br />The last piece, 'Paseo de Gracia' is more than only the instrumental version of 'La Sagrada Familia'.

B00009V7P8|5.0|It has been said that there is nothing new under the sun. Damien Rice's c.d. 'O' dispels this premise. A mixture of folk, classical, and even blues this disc will bring tears to your eyes. The sheer musicality of these well crafted gems as well as Rice's mournful delivery makes for an experience that is so powerfully personal, you feel as though you are eavesdropping on the innermost musings of this talented balladeer. Reminiscent of a male version of Annie Lenox at her solo best, this is one 'O' not to be missed!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I cannot believe some of the negative reviews this wonderfull movie got. Its a grand adventure and a great time to watch. And though there are differences from the novel, and yes, some big differences, it was still a very enjoyable movie. Those Tolkien fans who gave this movie a bad review you should return to your closets and let the rest of us have a good time watching a great movie. I cannot wait to buy this movie on DVD, grab a six pack and some hot wings, send the kids to bed, turn off the lights and enjoy this movie on my 65\\" TV with no interruptions.<br />leave us!
B00006879E|5.0|Originally I heard their song \\"harder to Breathe\\" on the radio, and came home to download it.  While I was, I searched for them on Amazon and saw they were linked with my favorite artist, Jason Mraz.  I listened to Maroon 5's C.D. and was amazed with the talent!  Its an incredible mix of vocals and instruments, and definitally worth a listen!
0452281881|5.0|In this hilarious romp through the butt-kissing, back-stabbing, sucking-up London advertising agency bent on capturing the golden nugget Coca-Cola account, the reader will be knee-deep in a fascinating flurry of emails.  A true masterpiece of writing, created from an email-only format, sans dialogue or narrative, it is a mind-blowing cyber fest.  Slimy execs jibe and jab at each other to hold onto to their vacuous corporate titles; while outside their plush overly-decorated offices, the \\"PA\\"s and other creative minions plot their downfall. A must read for workstation inhabitants worldwide.  You'll be prairie-dogging out of your cubes to pass the word on this wonderfully scribed novel. Warning - this is a non-stop page-turner.  Take a day off from your cubby-hole to read this tour de' farce.
6304508611|5.0|I watched this movie late one night...creeped me out!  After it went off, I proceeded to go downstairs to my family room to watch more tv.  I was carrying more than a handful of videos down with me.  Saw Carrie covered in the pig blood...and the tapes fell and I followed them!!  That's all I will say!!!
B00008R9KF|5.0|People made a huge deal out of this movie because of the gay content. It's really very minimal (two kisses, a lick on the neck and one very tasteful yet erotic scene and another little kiss later) Maybe a total of 3 or 4 minutes of the film (ok, though that turned into a half hour by all the replaying I did of those scenes - and yes, I'm a straight girl and still can't get enough of DDL's passionate kisses) It's very touching because it's so natural and a complete non-issue. No one dies of AIDS, no one makes a big drama scene about coming out of the closet, no one demands attention and acceptance for being gay(though *of course* gay people should be accepted) the film just really goes out of its way to show there's *nothing* deviant or strange to homosexuality. You could even see it as a symbolic point, that it's the one thing Omar and Johnny share that does not fit into either of their cultural equations. <br />My two other favorite characters were Omar's father and Tanya. This Pakistani family reminded me of my family. I am not Pakistani but the issues are the same. The dad was very poignant in the way he wanted better for his son, how he couldn't let go of his upper class background and how he looked down on the Johnny's sort but was kind and wanted better for him too. He reminded me of my grandparents. And then there was Tanya. I loved how she sort of bonded with Johnny in their way. What a great performance she gave. This film has so many threads and nuances and Omar's character balances it all with so much grace, respecting his culture and keeping close to his family but being true to himself at the same time by staying involved with Johnny. <br />I *love* Daniel Day Lewis!
B00005JLPK|4.0|First of all, I was very skeptical about how this film would turn out. In high school Spanish and Art classes, I learned a bit about Frida Kahlo, so I knew a litle bit of what she was like. However, this film has been one of the most interesting, somewhat controversial ones I have seen. Nominated for six Academy Awards, FRIDA is the biography of the famous Mexican painter, Frida Kahlo. <br />Salma Hayek was exceptionally amazing in her Oscar-nominated title role! I haven't seen a whole lot of her work, but she truly nailed this performance down hard. Alfred Molina gave an awesome performance as Diego Rivera! (NOTE: If you think Alfred is great in this film, he is just as good in films like NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER.) I give kudos to the awesome acting in this film!! The other things I loved about the film are the cinematography, the music, effects, and the art! The filmmakers have had recreated Frida's world as if it is happening now. It has given audiences a chance to really experience the magic of these things. Frida had a passion of all aspects of life, and the cast and crew were able to make it possible to show that same passion, especially in her paintings. The history and politics also brought in an interest for me, for it showed how the characters were able to share their ideas, cultures, etc. <br />Frida lived in pain, emotionally and physically, dealt with intense infidelity caused by Diego, her husband, and had some scandelous affairs of her own. The reason for the four stars is this: TOO MUCH sexual content. Yes, Diego and Frida had endured a tumultuous marriage. Yes, Diego was extremely unfaithful to her, but they stuck together until her death. However, in my opinion, Hollywood really didn't have to get into very explicit details with the sex affairs, language, and nudity. <br />But, despite all that, FRIDA is a film that really showed who she was, and what she did. She was a perseverent cripple; she was a revolutionary at heart; she is still considered one of the greatest artists ever known in the world. But most importantly, she was a very unique woman. If you like biopics, this is one you should at least rent. The special features are just as wonderful. If you fall in love with it, it will be a great addition to your DVD collection!
0679882820|5.0|I started to read this book to my twin boys at about the age of 6 months.  Out of all the books I read to them (which is a lot) this is their absolute favorite.  It gets their attention and keeps it throughout the whole book which is very hard at this age.  They are 9 1/2 months now and I still have not found another book that they like as much as this one!
B000003CM8|3.0|Los Allman Bothers son una de las formaciones más sólidas de blues rock americano de fines de los 60's, y aunque eso no es poco su nivel no está a la altura de sus competidores ingleses. No hay nada que decir respecto a su capacidad para asimilar y ejecutar el blues, contando con dos competentes guitarristas y una buena sección de apoyo, pero su ortodoxa aproximación a este estilo los hace ser una buena banda pero no más que eso.<br />Cuando en esa época ya han pasado muchas cosas dentro del rock americano se podría esperar algo un poco más aventurado por parte de los Allman, justamente algo como Dreams o Whipping Post, por mucho los temas más interesantes y donde se abren a nuevas cosas, el primero 7 minutos de electrizante blues sicodélico y el segundo un denso blues con un toque propio. Los 5 temas restantes son correctos pero fácilmente olvidables, dejando la impresión que sería mejor recurrir a otros discos para quedar conforme.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It saddens me so much to see an album of this caliber recieving anything less than a perfect rating. Especially when one of Radiohead's other cds recieved higher when it just isn't as good. Don't get me wrong, The Bends is a damn fine album filled with both good and great songs. The difference? This is an album filled with great and godly songs. Godly because they are just incredibly beautiful and deep musical works of art that I just don't seem to ever get tired of. This album also flows like a great novel. Thom York and company were obviously at the height of their creative talent here because it goes downhill after this, in my opinion. If you get one Radiohead album in your life, it has to be this one. Personal favorites of mine are &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Exit Music&quot;, &quot;Let Down&quot;, and &quot;No Surprises&quot;. Those are the very four I believe belong in the godly song category.
B00005JM02|5.0|Okay, this film is certainly up to the extremely high standards set by Pixar in all of it's films (all of which would rank 5 stars in my book, with the possible exception of Monsters, Inc.)  The characters are memorable, sympathetic and funny and the story is well-written and keeps you \\"hooked\\" (sorry, I couldn't resist).  But there were no outtakes at the end!  Please, oh please, Pixar, include \\"outtakes\\" at the end of the DVD.  The outtakes are the highlights of the Toy Story 2, Bug's Life and Monsters, Inc. DVD's!!!!!!!
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends is unquestionably aweseome! After hearing this one, I was almost sure nothing else by Radiohead could surpass it. I was wrong, but that doesn't take anything away from this. Each and every song on this album is a great piece of music. There just aren't any weak spots and that is rare for any album. It's tough to choose favorites from such a great lineup, but if you force me, it's gonna have to be \\"My Iron Lung\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\". All in all, The Bends is Radiohead's 2nd best album behind Ok Computer.
B00000JPH5|5.0|Labyrinth is one of those rare movies that grows in the overlap of several really brilliant, imaginative people, in this case arising from a blend of a Terry Jones script, Brian Froud art, and Jim Henson puppetry with a bit of David Bowie music added in to keep things danceable.  <BR>Jennifer Connelly plays Sarah, whose ill-timed wish to be rid of a screaming toddler (played by Brian Froud's son Toby) suddenly makes the world of goblins, pixies, and riddles she's often read of very real.  Hampered by a stunningly attractive Goblin King (David Bowie) who uses all the powers at his disposal to keep Toby for himself, she must learn how to work within the rules of the story at hand rather than assume the story will conform to hers to save her brother from goblins and her own sense of wonder from an encroaching unimaginative world.  <BR>Brian Froud and Terry Jones also collaborated on a book, &quot;The Goblin Companion,&quot; that explains the history of the Labyrinth and a bit of Goblin society, which makes the movie even more enjoyable.
B000002UR7|4.0|Radiohead's first album is a worthy debut for this great band. You can hear the beginnings of this band's great talent, later to be refined, oozing through every song. \\"Creep\\" became an enormous hit for good reason. It is a wonderful, emotional piece of music that remains one of Radiohead's best. It is too bad the band has come to dislike it. A great song is a great song. But not letting \\"Creep\\" steal the whole show, \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is the second great powerhouse song on this album. The rest is good, but not good enough to push the rating up to 5 stars. As a whole, Pablo Honey certainly couldn't be considered Radiohead's best, but it is a fine album nonetheless.
0446677450|5.0|This is great book if especially one is involved in the Rat Race <BR>of Earning, Paying Taxes and Spending whats left, in short you never see your money accumulate or work for you.<br />I would recommend it to everyone who really wants to be wealthy in the long run.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead, what is happening to you? After such incredible masterpieces like Ok Computer and The Bends, why are you changing your style like this? Well this album isn't horrible and maybe people with very different taste would like it, but I just can't put this in the same category as the earlier Radiohead greats. I like my music to be a moving and emotional experience. Not rhythmic, odd noises that put me to sleep. That's being a bit harsh, but I really wish Radiohead would return to their former style.
0316096199|5.0|Alice Sebold writes an astonishingly honest and hauntingly true recollection of her life surrounding her rape.  i was moved to tears;<BR>both because her words resounded so much of my own experiences myself being a rape and incest survivor and young woman.  She is so brave in her account, and speaks candidly of her conflictual emotions, gives a raw depiction of her truths and shows us as the reader the roller coaster that she rode and will continue to ride as a very beautiful woman and survivor.  She makes me feel like i am not alone, and her words helped me to validate my own experiences as i feel she must do for all readers who may have experienced something similar & i find myself nodding my head and identifying with her reality and feeling her hurt and relishing in her victory when there is those few moments.  It is a very intense memoir but her words are carefully selected and articulated showing her obvious genius and intellect.  Thank you, Alice, for giving a sounding board for readers to understand this experience or to relate and feel validated and heard.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Ryan trully has everything and everything can be heard on this album. Such talent for song writing, fabulous creation of melody. The is an album for feeling sad, happy, groovy, anything you want, this album has it! 5 stars for the greatest singer songwriter in the world today! (possibly greatest ever if he carries on like this!)
0671027573|5.0|I am new to Linda Howard's books but this one was realy good. The characters are interesting and the love story a joy to read.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have owned Radiohead's third album, OK Computer, for about five years now and I still can not stop listening to it. I can not honestly say I enjoy one Radiohead album more than another because they are simply incomparable. The sound of each album has its own mood. However, I listen to this album very often and have never stopped regularly listening to it. I can not say that any other artists have the musical intellectuality to make me feel that way. This is my favorite album and I would recommend all of their albums and you must listen to this album all the way through for a few times. For some people, it can be difficult to listen to because they don't sound like any other groups. But those too impatient to listen to it all the way through, just listen to the following songs: &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Exit Music&quot;, &quot;Let Down&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;, and &quot;No Surprises&quot;.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|2 Fast 2 Furious was a movie like any other about cars, drugs, and more cars (and of course girls). However, Paul Walker's acting could have been a litte bit more convincing. It's a little more than obvious that his ebonics just did not work for his character. Next time, Paul, choose a part where you don't have to fake your entire dialogue.
B000002LAB|5.0|True this is mostly producer/bassists Marcus Miller's work,<BR>true a cover of Scritti Politi's &quot;Perfect Way&quot; may seem suspect<BR>but I'll tell even FUSION snobs where to get off about &quot;Tutu&quot;-it's one of Miles's funkiest albums and a highpoint in his catolog!The tital track,&quot;Splatch&quot; and the deeply grooving<BR>&quot;Full Nelson&quot; pretty much exemplify the rest of what is to be found here-synthesizers,drum machines,deep bass licks and as always Miles's own distinctive playing that makes &quot;Tutu&quot; a pretty<BR>magical work of art and not a crass commercial ploy.Now if only<BR>the work Miles and Prince did together during this time could<BR>be released.???????
B00005YTFG|1.0|I'm a fan of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly - and nothing in this video approaches the singing and dancing of these two legends.  The characters were cardboard, the overuse of computer graphics was nauseating, the songs were just plain terrible - no reason to celebrate most modern pop, and I ended up feeling just drained after watching even 30 minutes of this calamity.<br />I wouldn't force this movie on my worst enemy.  I suggest that you pick up 'Singing in the Rain' if you want to see a musical with heart, dancing, and good singing.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Ok. dude. this man is amazing live. holy crap. ok, first of all, i should tell you that i live in this tiny town in the middle of nothing in oregon. so anyway, Coldplay came and played in a nearby town that's much bigger than my town, but still pretty small to hold coldplay's only oregon appearance. ANYWAY, unbeknownst to most of the crowd, damien rice was there, mostly messing with the mics in between sets and crap. everyone thought he was some funky stage hand or somethin. and i'll tell you, probably no one had heard of this guy anyway, so they wouldn't have known he was anybody famous. but then, after the opening band finished (Eisley, who TOTALLY rock to the max), he gets up there with his guitar and starts belting out all this crazy amazing engery into the microphone and we were all like WHOA this stage hand is AMAZING! and then he introduces himself, and we didn't know who the heck he was, but since he was irish, we all thought that was pretty swell. but DUDE i gotta say this man is AMAZING LIVE! if you EVER get a chance to see him live DO IT, I'M TELLING YOU! i'm not even a fan of his type o' music and i was like blown out of my socks. anyway. just wanted to tell you all that.
B00004Z459|1.0|I bought this CD because my best friend was IN LOVE with it, and assured me that I would like it, too. As soon as I began listening, I knew I had wasted my money. With whining vocals and laughable rapping, this sounds like Eminem if he took up &quot;heavy metal&quot; or whatever this is supposed to be. Each song made me wince in a new way. The lyrics try to be deep just for the heck of it, and up sounding contrived and meaningless. I can't understand how this CD sold so well. It's basicacally a repackaging of the same old N'Sync boy band formula. But I guess N'Sync sells well, too, and we all know about their musical talents.<BR>Pass.
0553381709|5.0|After reading the first 2 books I had come to a few conclusions about the series and about George R.R. Martin's writting.  First I realized that NO ONE was sacred, and anyone could suffer a horrible, screaming, ill-deserved fate.  Second I realized that the man can write, and write well, unlike so many writters in this Genre (I really think Martin should be his own genre) He doesn't write repetitive, dry, and cliche phrases, sentences, or chapters.  Third I realized that a WHOLE LOT of stuff happens, as opposed to so many fantasy books and series where the &quot;great cliche hero&quot; goes on his &quot;great cliche quest&quot; and nothing of importance happens for anywhere from 100 pages to 6 books.  Fourth I knew, with absolute Certainty that though everyone was &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; in his world, there was at least 1 evil, foul character, and his name was Jaime Lanister.  Then I read A Storm of Swords.  Never again will I presume to doubt the master.<BR>     To say that this is &quot;gritty Fantasy&quot; would be a severe understatement.  If you would like a book where good and evil are clearly defined, the good guys always win and the bad guys always loose and nothing really bad happens to the good guys, don't read this book; pick up david eddings of something.  If you want believeable (yes believable),emotionally engaging, intelligent, literature, then read G.R.R.M. <BR>     This series, and especially this book, are simply incredible, reading it will affect you, it will engage you, and it will surprise you.  If you read only one fantasy series in your life Read this one, If you read 2, pick up Tolkien.
B00008WT5M|5.0|This album is excellent, their last good solid hard rock album, which would later become slower and bluesier (Ballbreaker, Stiff Upper Lip).  You should reconize THUNDERSTRUCK and MONEYTALKS right away because they're instant classics, not to mention FIRE YOUR GUNS, which is so fast and catchy, or THE RAZORS EDGE which is the best song on here.  It really didn't really need to be remastered (It already had superb sound) but that's a plus because it's about 4-5 bucks cheaper than it was and it comes with a cool booklet.  Even if you have the original, GET THIS,  IT'S CHEAPER AND SOUNDS PERFECT.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I love The Beatles but this is not the beatles good stuff,<BR>there good stuff that was never massively popular<BR>case in point: Rocky Racoon, one of the best beatles songs ever but was never a hit.<BR>There is nothing from the White Album or Sgt Peppers the two most influential rock albums ever.<BR>This is the equivalent of a Jimi Hendrix Album without anything from &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; <BR>A best of has to be at least 4 albums long to make sense<BR>ARRRRRGHHHH<BR>Just go buy 4 Cd's: Sgt Peppers, The White Album, Revolver, and Abbey Road.(some may dissagree but I think this is the best and least flawed beatles album)
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has done a wonderful job with this book.  Not only is it a great mystery, it is a historical trip.  The knowledge that you gain by reading this book is invaluable.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery and is open to a new side of the past that will definitely leave you wanting more!
B00004XOWM|2.0|Who does Fred Durst think he is? I've now changed. Limp Bizkit is the BEST BAND EVER! NOT! Ever heard of Linkin Park, KoRn or Drowning Pool? Or even Pantera, SlipKnot, Coal Chamber, Ill 'Nino or Sevendust? They are way better than Limp Bizkit. Limp Bizkit: SELL-OUTS! The songs: My Way, Rollin'(Air Raid), My Generation and Take A Look Around are the only songs that have any talent. But, they have two good albums. Give Significant Other and Three Dollar Bill a chance. Limp Bizkit were once one of the best. Now they're just awful. Pick up a Drowning Pool or KoRn album.
B00004LN16|3.0|This album will be on constant spin in your cd player for aroiund a month then it will only make it out on rare occasions. Its a good album but lacks the giant sing along choruses that make AC/DC so great. I find it hard to believe that a so called &quot;fan since '78&quot; would make the asinine remark &quot;how about a drum roll phil?.&quot; DUHH when was the last time you heard a drum fill on an AC/DC record? This comment makes about as much sense as a three legged race horse.
B00005JKDR|4.0|My son wants to watch this movie everyday! We're not quite sure what he loves so much, but it is an enjoyable movie.  Some of the plot is confusing, which is odd for Disney, but it is excusable.  Recommended!
0385504209|5.0|I found The Da Vinci Code to be a thoroughly engrossing book.  It does an excellent job of weaving fact with fiction to produce a compelling story.  It is a mystery/thriller with plenty of science and even some mathematics behind it that help to weave an intriguing story.  The principal characters are well developed and there are some interesting \\"quirky\\" characters to help round out the plot.  Writing a story whose protagonists are an archaeologist and cryptographer does at first hand sound like a winning combination but Brown is able to pull it off.  The story is well paced and takes place in some very interesting locales, to say nothing about a plot that spans centuries.  If you're a conspiracy buff you'll also find plenty to enjoy.  I'd highly recommend this book, read it before the movie comes out!!
B00007LTIL|5.0|American Beauty and Workingman's Dead are the Dead's two classic studio albums. If you are going to buy any Dead studio albums - buy these.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Yet another British artist trying to break America. And yet again, you just don't get it. Some of you have recognised that this is a truly brilliant album from a fantastic artist. Most of you have just ignored him!<BR>During his Knebworth gig last week, the Robster announced that he was moving back to Britain full-time. I for one am glad we can have him all to ourselves again. This album is full of beautiful, funny, and just plain brilliant tracks. Something Beautiful? Me and My Monkey? Feel? Come on, people.
0385495323|5.0|While technical books are noted for draining the reader's mental resources, the Code Book deviates from the norm as it explains very intricate mathematical concepts in layman's terms. Couldn't find a more entertaining technical book while truly being enlightened on the world of cryptography. I can't wait to read this author's book on Fermat's Last Theorem.
B00009ATIX|1.0|I gave this movie a fair chance even after I was warned that it was a bomb. I suppose that this film was intended to be \\"artistic\\", but instead seemed silly and contrived. In a sense the concept of pet semetary (yes, cemetary spelled with an s..don't ask me..lol) is conveyed....the bringing back of loved ones lost, no matter the costs...but without gore, zombies or excitement whatso-ever. Maybe Solaris tries to be a love story...but fails to capture your heart like the likes of \\"somewhere in time\\". The longing is there...but the purpose and script are lacking. <BR>The only point made clear by this film: Georges naked [bottom]. I almost got tired of seeing it....<BR>Bottom (pun-pun) line: It will bore you to sleep. Skip it!
B00005JL96|5.0|i love animated movies and this is almost to the top of my list but sinbad was better. no offense. this has a cute story , funny jokes , and a cute little alien named stitch.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This is defenitly a college classic, still popular today.  Even though I'm only in my 20's this movie still is hillarious to my generation.  The parade scene and a few others were fillmed right in the downtown area of the town I grew up in, Cottage Grove, OR.  This is comming out just in time for the 25th anniversary, and the worlds largest toga party, to be held in Cottage Grove the last weekend in August.  A must for any college student who enjoys a good party!
0743455967|5.0|I am a new writer, learning the craft. I am deeply moved by his honesty, love and sincerity for writing. He has given himself, completely to the creative  process, and  the public. I love the parts about how his stories came to life; how his role as an artist is  to present, not to shape; and all the simple and down to earth rules on writing. This is my first review on line, because the book has given a great deal to me, and I must say something good in  return. Thank you.
B00005JLSE|5.0|As any movie buff will tell you, it is not just the words and the film, it is the heart that goes into and shines through on the screen that make a movie great.  &quot;Chicago&quot; has heart.  You can see the dedication that Rob Marshall had..especially since he choreographed the movie!  One has to admire the actors for breaking the mold that they we are used to seeing them in, and for the hours it must have taken to put it all together.<br />Putting aside that Zeta-Jones and Zellweger's characters are murderesses (that is not what is being glorified), I could not help but see the irony in it all.  &quot;Chicago&quot; takes a hard stab (no pun intended) at our culture and love of celebraties, and the pure denial that they can be anything but perfect and heroic.  For purely entertainment value, this movie is a masterpeice, certainly not the best of all time, but I defy anyone to watch this movie and not tap a toe, do a high-kick, and be infected by the spirit and sounds.  The movie, quite simply, rocks.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Our family continues to enjoy this set. Poor Wooster isn't very smart. One favorite referred to over and over is when Wooster faints. Very funny stuff.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|Furtwangler, the only composer to rise against the Nazis and defy their order in Germany also conducted an amazing performance of Don Giovanni here.  This is probably the BEST recorded version of Don Giovanni and the performance is top notch.  By the way, the sound quality is excellent, even if it is in mono, you don't even notice.  Don't ever let this great DVD pass you up, the performance, music, and conducting is one of the best you'll ever get to see.  True piece of art.

0060916540|4.0|Wonderful story of what one (two in this story) can accomplish when he is determined that he must.<br />To me the climbing of the glacier is secondary to the main point of the book which is getting down alive.<br />Wonderful read.

B00005JLZN|4.0|I found the Life of David Gale a very good movie! the end of the movie is very good and the performance of Mr. Spacey is incredible, as usual! Although when the film is over, I got to think that the movie doesnt show a David super activist Gale! it shows more of a drunken, lovin father and problematic person! so I think that they should enhance that section of his life, because the end (and of course, the whole movie..only we dont know that during the drama..) is related to that! just to end, I think that Spacey did wrong playing with Winslet feelings, although, the first think he said was \\"I dont want u to save me\\".<BR>besides this, great ending, great spacey! if youre a fan of super special effects and \\"crap\\" movies like Matrix or XXX , dont go see this! it has to much inteligence...
B000096I9G|4.0|First of all, let me say, don't buy this if you want to hear the studio albums while watching the band play them.  Many of the reviews herein say that the songs don't sound the same (the keyboards are different, the drums don't sound right).  This is true and if you are for some reason thinking that any live performance sounds like a studio performance you are horribly mistaken.<br />However, if you want to hear some of your favourite Cure songs and maybe even gain a different understanding of them by seeing them under a different light (because the vocals are different, the drums are different, etc.), then this is the DVD for you.<br />I would also like to point out that if you're used to really visually spectacular shows, on the scale of bands like Pink Floyd and Tool, you may find this DVD visually a bore.  I confess that I've only watched about a third of the actual video on this DVD because it bores me.  It's interesting seeing the instruments Robert Smith and the rest use on certain songs but watching them play and sing can become tedious.<br />Now for the real review.  The music on these two DVDs is absolutely stunning.  My two personal favourite Cure albums are Bloodflowers and Disintegration.  Despite subtle changes in singing and the low volume on the lead guitar in some parts, I like this version of Bloodflowers as much if not more than the studio version (and that's saying a lot).  Disintegration doesn't quite live up to its studio version, but I think after listening to it a few times you will find that it is also amazingly well done.<br />The true miracle of this DVD duo, however, is the Pornography set.  I really didn't like \\"Pornography\\" the album much when I bought it.  I found certain songs to be very good, but the album seemed to drag on from song to song.  Not so in this live version.  I truly gained a new appreciation for \\"Pornography\\" (that sounds kind of funny, doesn't it?).<br />Bottom line is, if you didn't like one of these three albums butliked the other two, maybe this is the Trilogy for you.  Though the visual element is lacking slightly, the audio is worth it.  Trilogy may have been more appropriate as a three CD set, but since it isn't this is the next best thing.
B000002L9J|5.0|One of their best albums.  It has many moods.  Not all are morose as most label the Smiths' music - Frankly Mr. Shankly, Vicor in a Tutu and Some Girls are Bigger Than Others are  examples of how Morrissey like to have fun with lyrics.  I bought the cassette in high school when it came out and still listen to it today.  I love it.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|i have already written one review but i have not seen it on this site yet. dylan is prophesying, he's preaching the glory of god in the person of jesus christ.you cannot really understand his true meaning, although there are certainly many layers of thought involved, unless you ara a true christian and studying the word of god like dylan is and i am. for instance dweedle dum and tweedle dee are death and hell. not one reviewer of 280 knows this. this includes the self ordained professors. now plug in death and hell and see how the song makes perfect sense.mississippi is d. living on a fleshly level instead of walking in the spirit. he only did one thing wrong, stayed in the flesh a lifetime to long. bye and bye, moonlight, honest with me, are the lord jesus speaking to his church, thru dylan. the lord loves us so very much he wants to meet us all alone so we can have fellowship with him just like two lovers. he's breathing a lovers sigh because we don't understand it, his feelings[love]for us, we'd be honest with him if only we[could get a revelation of it]knew.dylan can't know when it's time to strike[die].he can't take us across the river of death, only jesus knows the things we truly should like.only jesus can baptize in fire so we can sin no more.summer days of peace and joy are gone from this earth. but d. knows in the kingdom of god there is peace and joy, and in the lords kingdom [the highlands] its still and now going on. po boy is the prodigal son.the love of god- and the theft of this truth- is truly the correct understanding of the title. false teachers, prophets, have corrupted this truth and d. is setting it right, you always knew he was a true prophet anyhow.my captain, who is well decorated is jesus. the loverman is the devil.high water is analogy of noahs flood. as it was in the days of noah so shall it be when the son of man returns.floater is the holy spirit. for the wind listeth were it will,and you here the sound there of, but you can,t tell where it came from nor where its going, so is everyone born of the spirit.if a child asks for bread will you give him a stone. how much more will the father give you the spirit to those who ask.is it to much to ask,no.i'll stop here.i would like to do a word analysis of all the songs. most everyone raves about this album.d. got it all from god.last night the wind was whispering,i was trying to make out what it was.dylan did a great job of hearing what the spirit sayeth to the churces. this is the most incredible album ever done, ever.why, because d. is preaching the glory and love of god to a truly needy world.this is my only praise and worship album. may it now bless you as you hear it in the spirit.
B00005QK5X|5.0|One of the most under rated bands of all time. This is a great set. You get the first 3 lps plus tons of bonus tracks. This set is recommended both as an introduction to the Wipers or for the long time fan. Songs like &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, &quot;Youth of America&quot;, &quot;Doom Town&quot; and &quot;Return of the Rat&quot;, american rock songwriting doesn't get better than this. Greg Sage's desperate yet haunting guitar playing is beyond words. Buy this now!!
B000089RVX|4.0|With so much corporatized music out there, Evanescence has defintately come up with a distinctive sound.  A great combination of hard rock and dark rock.  Some people may think &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is overplayed, but it is a song that definately gets you pumped.  Thankfully, Evanescense is not like so many other bands who seem to put all their effort into one great song and turn out 8 or 9 others for the album that lack any power.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; shows a softer side to the band.  &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is really freaky, but I love the guitar and the overall feel of the song.  &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; has terrific energy.  Along with some solid musicians, Amy Lee has a dynamite voice.  The best way to describe it is think of Patti Smythe of Scandal fame, only an octave higher.<br />If Evanescence doesn't drastically change their sound, they should be around for a long, long time.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Prior to watching this DVD, Led Zeppelin did not make my list of top ten rock groups of all time, but now they're safely in the top 5.  Clearly their studio albums did not do full justice to their talents -- think hendrix, dead, and especially cream.<br />Commonly known as the father of hard rock and/or heavy metal, it now seems to me that those genres are just what emerged as less musically talented and innovative bands tried to copy zeppelin.  With heavy english blues-rock at their core, zeppelin seamlessly integrates psychedelia, rock n roll and even folksy acoustic. <br />Though maybe less consistent than clapton in that era, jimmy page cannot be beat when he's on, which he is numerous times in this collection.  Bonham is both wild and subtle on the drums. And though Plant would later take some jabs for his sexy stage posturing, I can't think of anything cooler than watching him and Page doing their thing live in 1970.<br />For those who think \\"stairway to heaven\\" when they think zeppelin, then watch this DVD and think again -- their musical energies flowed much deeper and wilder than their biggest hit.
0930289234|3.0|This graphic novel has it all.  The art is good (not great though), the story is tight with details that reveal themselves with further readings.  There is imagery, foreshadowing and other literary devices absent in so many graphic novels.  With so many great things going for this I could only give it 3 stars because the ending was disappointing, it was a little too gritty for my taste and somehow, despite the parts, the whole was less than their sum.
B00009V7P8|3.0|Like some of the other reviews of this disk - I got turned on to it via the song &quot;Volcano&quot;.  I had heard about it prior to it's release in the Boston Globe, but couldn't find it while I was in Boston.<br />Though there isn't a ton of people doing this type of music currently, I find it inspiring that someone can get something like this released the way the music marketing machine currently exists.  CD Database puts the genre under 'rock', but 'folk' would be closer to an accurate description.<br />&quot;Volcano&quot; might be as close as Rice gets to a hit in the U.S. - and though it won't get radio airplay, it deserves exposure.  But &quot;The Blower's Daughter&quot;, &quot;Amie&quot; and the first 5 (or even 8) minutes of &quot;Eskimo&quot; are very good. &quot;Eskimo&quot; drags on another 11 minutes which is entirely unnecessary, in my opinion.<br />The rest of the album falls into the 'good' category.  And that should say something, considering the current state of music<br />The potential for this album gets 4.5 stars.....but in the bigger picture, I give it 3.  Rice certainly has the potential for more powerful stuff.
6302881005|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most romantic films I have ever seen.  It reigns supreme in my collection.  This film is not about money - far from it, it is about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I think initially John Gage felt that Diana would have been a pushover and blinded by all his billions but she was no easy feat which he soon understood with serious consequences.  I am sure both John & Diana were secretly asking themselves why they didn't meet sooner.  Havent we all found ourselves in that position at some point in our lives.<BR>The way John seduced Diana was amazing.  Did anyone see the way he held her eyes at the Craps table, or when they went to his house or what about when he was on the boat with her.  He was amazingly funny and at other times deadly serious and that's what was so touching.<BR>I think deep down Diana really fancied John but found it difficult to cope with the guilt of leaving her husband.  Let's face it, he was no competition for John.<br />Robert Redford has always been one of my favourite actors.  He has the ability to take on various roles which unfortunately a lot of today's actors can't do.  As for him offering $1 million dollars to sleep with him, I would have given him change out of a dollar !!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001FA4|5.0|This album is their least commercial of all, but the most artistic, in my view. The cascading drums of 'A Sort of Homcoming' begins the passionate journey, which is The Unforgettable Fire. It's interesting to hear the musical progression from 'Boy' to this record, in only 4 short years (I'm assuming that Eno and Lanois' influence had a big part in that evolution).  'Pride' is the only departure on an album that cares more about taking you on a passionate journey, than feeding you songs with a hooky chorus. Some of my favorites include, ' A Sort of Homecoming', a great opening force of raw passion and spirit, 'Wire', which reminds me of some the music of today, although with more depth and focus, 'The Unforgettable Fire',  with its haunting guitar overlaying and strong supporting string arrangement, 'Prominade', for it's beautiful story of falling in love in a seaside town and it's poetic lyrics, and of course, 'Bad', which is a fantastic build type song that reaches a pinnacle of emotional passion. <br />I love every song on this album, including Elvis Presely and America, and everytime I hear the opening of Edge's guitar on 'Pride', it reminds of of that fall of 1984 when the airways were filled with Cindy Lauper, Madonna, hair bands, and a host of New Wave synth [stuff] and remembering that great guitar work just blowing me away. For a 20 year old who wanted something raw, yet powerful, that was music to my ears and thank God U2 was there to keep mainstream rock honest and back on course. <br />'Joshua Tree'  and 'Achtung Baby!' may have a better collection of pop tunes, but when I want to hear U2 at their artistic pinnacle I always put in Unforgettable. This record is timeless and it still stands up today.<br />I'm somewhat looking forward to U2's next, which should be coming out late this year, but I'm not expecting anything to match what was done from '84-'91. I just hope they continue to be as passionate as ever, regardless of what Henry Rollins says about them. (...)
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead has put out a masterpiece with \\"OK Computer\\", but in terms of every song standing on its own, \\"The Bends\\" excels. Remember, OKC had \\"fitter happier\\". This album is a solid 48-minutes of emotional (not emo) rock: it can be depressing for some, but for most its a joyous demonstration of the power of song.<br />Planet Telex: a rousing opener, breaks like dawn. huge opener. A<BR>The Bends: the title track is another big rocker, the guitar here is fantastic. the drums were recorded in one take! wow. A<BR>High and Dry: the first acoustic based song, Thom's vocals are so pure they seem dipped in honey. A-<BR>Fake Plastic Trees: stunning vocals from Thom. inspired by Jeff Buckley, he'd be proud to call this his own. A+<BR>Bones: flat-out rocker, you can feel it in your bones. A<BR>[nice dream]: one of my favorites: a lulling, hypnotizing lullaby that holds menace. dreamy, like its title! A<BR>Just: the big hit: stunning guitar, stunning video, close to perfect. A<BR>My Iron Lung: I love the guitar riff, rocks hardcore. A<BR>Bulletproof: like floating away on a cloud... A-<BR>Black Star: straightforward rocker with a good melody, lyrics about sexual frustration (maybe) and satellites. A-<BR>Sulk: a more down-beat rock song with fantastic lyrics and great singing. A<BR>Street Spirit [fade out]: wow...like a soft rain that thickens into a monsoon and washes you away. brilliant video and a stunning end to a near-flawless album. A+<br />Near-flawless? Well, I suppose every album has that one little thing you'd like to change: perhaps a better guitar sound or maybe a faster piece. But that's just crying over spilled milk - \\"The Bends\\" is as flawless as you can possibly get. No filler, no bum notes, every song crafted to its own perfection, this album set the stage for the changes to occur. In recent years, in fact, it has rivalled its follow-up in acclaim and stands as perhaps the \\"Revolver\\" to OKC's \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". Either way, get this album and you will not regret it.Fantastic.
B000002LIM|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars to a movie score/soundtrack but this one deserves it.  The music is great.  If you've seen the mvoie you'll know what I mean.  If not, take my work and everyone else here who rated this 5 stars!
B00004Z459|5.0|This is my favorite cd. i like all the songs. i used to not like metal, but now it is ok. My favorite songs on this cd are, Papercut, Crawling, One Step Closer, and In the end. I heard about this cd from friends, but i wasnt so sure i would like it. I went out and bought it and i was suprised. Now they are my favorite band and i say to everyone who is reading this. if you havent gotten this cd, GET IT! it is very much worth your time and money.
0688163173|2.0|After reading a number of good reviews, including the ones on here, I picked it up and read it today (it's a very easy read). While it was entertaining, I did find it to be quite predictable and an amalgamation of other stories of this type. It's understandable the characters were not developed too well because of the twist in the story and too much emphasis might have given the game away but I found the book to lack depth in all descriptive areas from locations, characters and the dream sequences. I don't mean to discredit the author as I have not read any of his other books but I found Shutter Island to be a very trashy piece of pulp and having just finished reading Mike Davis' &quot;City Of Quartz&quot; and John Krakauers' &quot;Under The Banner Of Heaven&quot; I found this to be quite a step down in quality... Oh well, that's just my opinion! If you want a quick and easy pulpy thriller I guess this would rank along with the best Dean Koontz and Stephen King but if you're looking for some depth, I'd move on.
0553382179|5.0|I was drowning in clutter. <br />No, it's true.  My house was a disgrace.  We would do a classic &quot;stash and dash&quot; whenever someone came over.<br />Then, I came across the FlyLady website.  The very next day, I went out and bought this book.<br />I read her book in one afternoon.  I did exactly what she suggested.  <br />To make a long story short, I have thrown out over 1,000 pounds of clutter and am proud to have people over.<br />And it only takes 15 minutes a day!
B00004XONN|5.0|I'm mighty tempted to tone this review down to four stars, just to avoid looking like a die-hard fan who blindly names any of my favorite artist's albums as five-star. However, the more I listen to this album, the more I realize this is a five-star album in every sense. For one, the production is terrific: the album sounds wonderful. The advertising was genius: no tour, no videos, very few interviews, just a series of 30-second blips with abstract images. And of course, what matters the most: the music! The progression from &quot;Creep&quot; to anything on &quot;Kid A&quot; makes you realize that Radiohead are either completely fearless in their own pursuit of music or just plain nuts. Maybe both. Either way, nothing could prepare me for the surprises in this disc upon my first listen. It was like stepping onto a whole new planet while aliens serenaded me.<BR>Listening to the album now, I still love the electronic songs. &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; is a wonderfully warm song, like a bath in warm goo. The title track is a little freaky with its robotic voice and toy box sounds. &quot;National Anthem&quot; is a free-jazz freakout and &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; is an acoustic lament frozen in a glacier. The second side is completely flawless, from the rocking of &quot;Optimistic&quot; to the suspended harps of &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;.<BR>You may not like it, and you may be given a heart attack from the shock, but it will grow on you if you give it a chance. A brave new step for Radiohead.
B00003CXAA|3.0|No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two &quot;Godfather&quot; films, &quot;The Conversation,&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;) and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (&quot;Peggy Sue Got Married,&quot; &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot;, the third &quot;Godfather&quot;) earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema.<br />But before &quot;Jack&quot; there was &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  While I feel the whole &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority?  People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.<br />And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do).  But I think &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy combined.<br />Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best.  It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision.  &quot;The Godfather&quot; doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound.  It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point.  The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, &quot;The Godfather&quot; offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.<br />Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films.  There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again.  Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat.  But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.<br />Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe.  The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.<br />Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).<br />Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.<br />My Grade---<BR>Part I: A<BR>Part II: B<BR>Part III: C-
B00008H2LB|5.0|People dont like Meteora as much as hybrid theory, but i dont see why. Dont get me wrong, i love hybid theory. but i also love meteora. It has a newer sound, and like hybrid theory, i like every song on the cd. The only things i disliked were that It is only like 36 min. long, and it took too long for them to put a cd out. I mean, all the bad artists, like 50 cent come out with one every 6 months. But, i guess u cant rush art. My favorite songs on the cd are Numb, Faint, and Breaking the Habit. This cd gets 5 stars from me, and thats hard to do.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I'm basing the five stars on the film I watched twenty times in a single week when it played at the Quad-eight Theaters in Saginaw, MI when it was first released.  I'm basing this on the copy I recorded off MTV when it aired.  I'm basing the five stars based on the slightly edited and tinkered version that came out on laser disc several years ago.  Even edited, and tinkered and toyed with, THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT is one of the greatest band documentaries ever made.  What made it so special was the fact that Jeff Stein was a fan of the band and made this film because of his love of THE WHO that he wanted to share with the world.<br />Now, with the restoraton complete, the additional footage, the interviews attached, and the audio made even better with the 5.1, a great film about a great band has become even better.
0385504209|5.0|There is no way to keep this book from pulling you in.  There is so much suspense and intrigue that it is impossible to put the book down.  Not only is it entertaining, but it forces you to look at the ideas of truth and history in a completly different light.  Do not read this book if you are not comfortable with new and radical points of view.  For everyone else, I promise you will love it.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I think it's a shame that Michael feels obligated to replicate &quot;Thriller&quot; even 20 years after it was released. He should accept the album as a perfect pop culture event that is impossible to replicate and get on making with making music completely from the heart (because it's hard to believe a lot of &quot;Invincible&quot; is from there).<BR>But we're here to discuss &quot;Dangerous&quot;, and I enjoy this album. People will talk about how the new jack production courtesy of Teddy Riley is merely there to ride a trend and not create a new one. True, a lot of those songs are somewhat dated, but the melodies contained in the production hold up even today. The first six songs are indeed some of Michael's edgiest, if not necessarily best, songs since &quot;Bad&quot;. The second half containing Michael's own productions are less tame, but they are also killer songs. &quot;Who Is It&quot; is magnificent, &quot;Give in to Me&quot; to cool in a stalker kinda style, while the ballads are hugely anthemic, if not a little too overwrought. &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; is a great example of what a pure, emotionally charged voice Michael carries. The one beef I have with this album are the unfortunately dated raps in &quot;Jam&quot; (from Heavy D) and &quot;Black and White&quot; (from...someone). They are too easily recognizable as early 90s rapping and sound hilarious. But not in a good way.<BR>Lots of people of slander Michael for straying from his pop roots, severing ties with Quincy Jones and going overboard with his paranoid lyrics. However, on the enjoyment scale and the &quot;pump in your car&quot; scale, this album rates high. It may be 77-minutes long, but you can listen to this album in one piece.
B00009W0WM|4.0|Ah, \\"Casablanca.\\"  Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliche?  That's not a criticism of the movie.  If anything it's the reverse.  What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness?<br />It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release).  I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the filmmaking techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't.  At best, \\"Casablanca\\" exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of filmmaking working at its slickest and most polished.<br />But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me.  The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, \\"Citizen Kane\\" such continual fuel for film discussion.  People still love \\"Casablanca\\" for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that \\"right place, right time\\" allure.  America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures.  So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord.  No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so instensely poignant.  And no wonder the patriotic, \\"do whatever you must for the good of the cause\\" propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).<br />Is \\"Casablanca\\" a great film?  I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites.  But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.<br />My grade: B+
B00003CWRX|5.0|One of the reviewers stated they could not skip the previews on the DVD version. I have had no such problem. This is an excellent film!
0156027321|5.0|I've never written an Amazon.com review before, but this book has compelled me to.  While I adored the author's descriptions, characterizations and humanity, it was the spiritual questions that Pi asks us to consider, that made this one of my all-time favorite books.  For me, the heart of the book is at the end, when Pi and the Japanese officials converse about the sinking of the ship.  Pi asks us to consider if, given that the event has already taken place, and there is no one now living (except him) who witnessed it, wouldn't the officials prefer \\"the better story\\" of his lifeboat experience...by which he is proposing to us, the readers, \\"the better story\\" of some representation of God.  Early in the book, Pi seeks insight from Christianity and Islam, as well as his native Hinduism, so we are invited to consider images of God from these three perspectives.  Pi understands atheists, who may make a \\"deathbed leap of faith,\\" but has no patience for agnostics, who stay \\"beholden to dry, yeastless factuality\\" and reason.  Pi doesn't prescribe to us WHICH \\"better story\\" to choose (which is why I can love the book), but, metaphorically through his astounding adventures aboard the lifeboat, invites us to consider the many marvelous ways of envisioning the Eternal.<br />All my interpretation aside, this is also a wonderfully descriptive and exciting adventure story, along the lines of \\"Towing Jehovah\\" by James Morrow.  Granted, it is a bit bloody and violent at times, but in the spirit of the honest and necessary violence of the carnivore. This is a book to think about; it even includes a Reading Group Guide at the end, just in case you want to add to the multitude of questions that will bubble up for you as you read it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie had it all music and great songs.  Awesome direction.  The love scenes were wonderful I watch it over and over again.  The colors and music just great.  The actors and actresses wonderful.  This movie is so truly moving.
B00003CX9E|5.0|There's not much to say about &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; that hasn't already been said.  I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced, but I propose the reason for that is this: the film and narrative techniques on display in &quot;Kane&quot; have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective.  I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think &quot;Kane&quot;'s uniqueness will be apparent.<br />I don't think the film is without flaws.  Welles' pacing can be slow at times, and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags.  The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time, but one doesn't (or shouldn't) watch &quot;Kane&quot; for the originality of the story.  Instead, pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it.  When the film is over, ask yourself this: can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story?  Do you really know what happened to him?  <br />This is radical stuff for 1941. Can you imagine a movie being released at that time that didn't answer the questions it raised?  The motivation that puts the entire world of the film in motion remains unresolved.  That doesn't happen very often in films even now, let alone then.<br />And if none of this is reason enough to watch &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; just watch it for the stunning cinematography and compositions.  Virtually every frame is a work of art in itself.<br />And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, then just watch it for Orson Welles' mesmerizing performance in the title role.  Easily one of the ten best in cinema history.<br />And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, you're on your own.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|At The Drive-in is one of the best Punk/Metal Bands out there And very hyper!
B00008BXJF|5.0|What's the best: each song is full of variations, which could be little as few well-placed notes, that catch your attention after several listens, and keep the music fresh and interesting.  Other high points: the intricacies and intensity of &quot;Level Five&quot;; the gorgeous three-songs-in-one &quot;Power to Believe II&quot;; the plaintive, recurring refrain of the title; and the swagger of &quot;Facts of Life&quot;.  What did not work: the low volume of the music in first third of &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot;, a great intense instrumental marred by not cranking up the volume soon enough; and most of the words of &quot;Happy...&quot;, which still grow old quickly, even when you look at them as a commentary on hard rock music composition today.<br />The music itself is incredible.  There are some good lyrics, but nothing except for the recurring &quot;Power to Believe&quot; segment that really rises to the timeless excellence of 80's Crimson or Thrak.  Most of the critiques are pretty small, though, and seven months after purchase, I'm still listening to it more than any other Crimson/Fripp/ProjeKCt/Gunn album I own.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|POTC was a rare offering from the swashbuckling genre in recent times, and the soundtrack lives up to the movie. Reviewers are quick to point out how this is &quot;typical Media Ventures&quot;. Which is a little unfair because quite likely Disney in fact *wanted* that kind of a sound, and the studio delivered. I think the music is great, expect to run into tunes from Gladiator, The Rock etc.<br />My only gripe with the compilation though is how terribly organized it is. If you have seen the movie, you'll know what I mean. None of the titles on this CD corresponds with the music on it. Track #14 One Last Shot has the final four mintues of music in the film including the scene where Elizabeth says &quot;He's not a blacksmith, hes a pirate&quot;. Yet track 15 which is &quot;He's a Pirate&quot; is the first few mintues of music in the credits. This is just one of about 15 different examples.<br />To make matters worse, they left over 30 mintues of CD blank when they left out two major battle scenes, the one where Jack and Will fight in the shop, and when Barbossa takes over the ship that Will, Elizabeth and Jack's crew are trying to escape on. The entire album is a mere 43 minutes.<br />Smacks of a little greed from Disney but imho the music is good enough to get you to look past all of these minor grouses. Definitely worth a shot.
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you could create music that defined swinging in a hammock on a warm day at sunset, this would be it.  Nora Jones debut CD, &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, is like the slow flow of smoke wrapping around you in a jazz club.  Not only is she talented on the piano and in writing some of the songs, her voice doesn't need to be stretched to reaching across the octaves.  Few artists leave you feeling that you heard the songs along with experiencing the emotions.  If you expect a couple of tracks to stray far from her popular songs, you will disappointed.  There is no show boating or over singing the songs going on here. <br />I wonder how long until you've played this CD too much and you'll have to go get another!??!?!
B000001IPP|5.0|I just bought this album 2 weeks ago and i love it! I became a Rancid fan 3 Years ago by listen to the other albums nothing compares to this album.In the album &quot;Harry Bridges&quot; is one of those sad ending songs but love this album! RANCID RULEZ!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|What the hell is the matter with the people who think that Evanescence is another Linkin Park.  This is so false.  For one thing, Amy Lee's Evanescence is so much more better then LP.  Linkin Park cant hold a tune to this new heavy metal group led by an incredible songwriter in the form of Amy Lee.  This album is filled with incredible music and i cant find a single complaint at all besides the fact that eleven songs isnt enough.  The album opens up with the incredible song  &quot; Going Under &quot;.  It is a great opening song and Amy's voice is icnredible.  &quot; Brink Me To Life &quot; is next.  By far the best song on the album.  I never get sick of it even though its played alot on the radio.  Its capped off by Paul McCoy of 12 stones  ( another incredible band ).  &quot; Everybody's Fool &quot; is next.  This song has a great intro and even greater lyrics.  It goes very well after &quot; Bring Me To Life&quot;.  The next song is &quot; My Immortal &quot;  and its absolutely incredible.  Amy's voice is the best on this song and she just literally pierces right through u.  &quot; Haunted &quot;  follows this and its another great song where Amy harmonizes with herself through most of it.  Its a slow beat song with a haunting tune.  &quot; Turniquet &quot; is next and this one is golden.  Salvation is the theme of this song and the feeling of suicide is in the lyrics.  It flows right into the next song &quot; Imaginary &quot; which is very similar sounding to &quot; Bring Me To Life &quot;.  This song is really great and the lyrics are incredible.  The next song &quot; Taking Over Me &quot;   will probobly be a single of theirs after &quot; Going Under &quot;.  Its an incredible song .... great for getting pumped up.  The next song  &quot; Hello &quot; is similar to &quot; My Immortal &quot;  only more haunting.  Not many people liked it but i loved it.  Amy's voice is just as good and the lyrics are just as good 2, if not better.  The next song  &quot; My LastBreath &quot;  is nothing special i hate to say.  Thats the only negative thing in this review....but its still an incredible song.  And it ends off with the very goth like &quot; Whisper &quot;.  Now this is a great song and it concludes a great album.  I havent heard an album like this in a long time.  Its incredible.  Please somehow hear this album.
B00005JMC6|5.0|This is the kind of film we need more of.  Not smarty-pants indies about losers spewing pop-culture reference, not four-way split-screen showoffs, and not jaded Gaspar Noe-style gorefests.  Rather, Whale Rider is an intimate, heartfelt story told with complete earnesty with skill and expressiveness, with acting to die for.<br />The enchanting Keisha Castle-Hughes deserves an Oscar nomination for a soulful, rich performance as Pai, the last heir in a long line of Maori chieftains, and an end to the bloodline according to tradition, by virtue of being a girl.  The heartbreaking opening sequence immediately sets the acting and emotional bars high, gripping the audience right off the bat.  One of the best openings of any film I've ever seen.  And when Castle-Hughes launches into the monologue that is the emotional core of the film, it's a moment of pure magic.  The last child performance with this level of emotional depth that I can remember is Jena Malone in Bastard Out of Carolina -- all the more impressive considering it's Castle-Hughes' first film.  She is definitely a star in the making, an actor of rare gift.<br />The rest of the cast is equally stellar:  Rawiri Paratene achieves just the right balance between gravity and likeability as Pai's grandfather Koro, making him the best kind of antagonist -- the one we sympathize with.  Vicky Haughton as Nanny and the incredibly versatile Cliff Curtis as Porourangi offer stirling supporting performances.<br />Aside from one or two minute editing choices in the dialogue scenes, I really find no flaw in this film.  The pacing slows down greatly near the end, but all to good effect; the cinematography is beautiful; director Niki Caro's shot choices and writing are both sharp and engaging; and Lisa Gerrard is in her element her, offering a minimalistic and repetitive, yet perfectly tailored score which serves the film well.  I'm not a big fan of all her work, finding her tendency to always use exotic music styles sometimes irritating (especially in The Insider, whose specific American angle was compromised by Gerrard's chants), but in Whale Rider, Gerrard is the perfect choice for a composer.<br />A gripping emotional experience, and a truly fine film that scales the heights.rritating (especially in The Insider, whose specific American angle was compromised by Gerrard's chants), but in Whale Rider, Gerrard is the perfect choice for a composer.<br />A gripping emotional experience, and a truly fine film that scales the heights.
B00005JMCR|5.0|Most of the great characters from the American Pie series return for a great movie.Though Nadia, Vicky, Heather, Oz, Jessica, and Stifler's brother aren't in this one it is still a big win! There are some new faces such as Michelle's sister Cadence who is played by January Jones. If you loved American Pie and American Pie 2 you'll love American Wedding even more. So do your self a favor and go see American Wedding starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Seann William Scott, and January Jones.<br />Kyle Cormier
B000059XUO|5.0|An enduring triumph for Lee, one that underscores the tragedy of his untimely death. Anyone who likes a good action movie with some heart will love this movie.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|this cd rocks. I love the songs &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;, &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;, &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; &amp; &quot; Show Me Love&quot;. They are definetly the best girl band of the planet.This cd is definetly one of the best ever recorded. My other favourite cd's are Dannii Minogue - &quot;Neon Lights&quot;, Craig David - &quot;Slicker Than Your Average&quot;, Avril Lavigne - &quot;Let Go&quot;, Busted - &quot;Busted&quot;, Sugababes - &quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot; &amp; Gorillaz - &quot;Gorillaz&quot;
B000002KHF|5.0|According to Pop Music Orthodoxy, rock 'n' roll is white, soul is black. Such arbitrary segregation, of course, doesn't explain why Jimi Hendrix remains the greatest rock guitarist of all time, and why Moondance, made by a white Irishman, is the greatest soul record ever made.<BR>From the Smokey Robinson crooning of &quot;Crazy Love&quot; to the restless spiritual romance of &quot;Into The Mystic,&quot; Van Morrison merges the concerns of mind and heart, heaven and earth as seamlessly as any artist in the history of recorded music. The title track riffs on jazz without sliding into pretention, while &quot;Glad Tidings&quot; harks back to &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; with its pure giddy good feeling and punchy horns.<BR>Even more than Astral Weeks, this is the record where Van Morrison proved himself a legendary writer, singer, and band leader with an uncommon power to entrance and move his listeners.<BR>Whether you're making out or making your peace with the Great Beyond, Moondance is a must. And next time you play the CD or hear a cut on the radio, follow Van's command at the end of &quot;Caravan.&quot;<BR>TURN IT UP!
B00008IAMD|5.0|this is a fantastic album from beginning to end. Because of what he has done in his life none of the songs are hard to believe. from the cryptic words before the first song to the last song. Some of my favorite songs on this CD are bridge over troubled water simply because of what the song is, I hung my head. One of my favorite songs on the CD Hurt because it reminds me of someone i know and care greatly about considering which it moves me very much. This CD is worth the purchase and much more

0060920084|1.0|A boring trip written by a fat, coarse author. I'm thankful I've traveled many of the states that make up the USA without Bryson's help.  It is true that many people in the United States regret the demise of the Americana of our cities and towns, but his portrayal was oftentimes unfair or simply incorrect.  Too many drinks do an eye blear.  Under those circumstances it might have been better for us and Mr. Bryson had he just forgotten this entire trip.  Thank goodness, he    writes more humorously and intellectually and less self-centeredly in his later years.
B000002R48|4.0|This cd is still good, it isnt Dream Theater's best work, but it isnt their worst work either( I give that to Falling into Infinity).  Charlie Dominici is the singer on here, he left after making the cd and thats when they brought in James LaBrie.  Charlie's vocals arent as good, kinda annoying in a sense.  The whole album sounds very 80's like, but some songs are still worth listening to, like The Killing Hand, A Fortune in Lies, and Afterlife.  There is still some great solo work, but they obviously kept getting better since.  For a Dream Theater fan, especially like me, I couldnt be w/o this cd either way, and I believe its worth getting.  Only gave it 4 stars due to Charlie's vocals.
0425173895|5.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of Agatha Christie's most talked about mysteries with a shocking ending (matched in a sort of frustrating cleverness only by Murder on the Orient Express).  I first read this book as a teenager and remember distinctly being angry at the denoument but, on a sober second reading, have grown to appreciate its cleverness.  Some readers may feel tricked but that is the glorious point of the book.  It wakes up the readers of mystery novels from looking at things in the same way and to remember to keep open to all possibilities.  What is especially nice is the way in which the novel still holds up on a second reading.  Recommended for the fan of English country house mysteries.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I've seen Pirates 6 times, and the last 2 were just to hear the music and place it with the movie scenes. The score for this movie is unbelievable. Badelt does an amazing job of making it piratey, adventureous, sweeping, and dramatic all at the same time, and in a few of the tracks particularly #5, kinda creepy. But that's all part of the magic. I think the reason this movie has been so successful is because of it's ability to transport people to the Caribbean and pulls them into the world of Captain Jack Sparrow, and this score does the same thing. Normally I am not a score type person, for instance the great Lord of the Rings soundtrack held my interest for one listen. Not so with this. I listen to it every day and everytime I hear it, I get an irresistable urge to see the movie again. Definitely 5 stars.
B000000OAA|5.0|Now this 3rd album of theirs was certainly the one that got the most attention from people in the States, and it's understandable. You've got 'Brighton Rock' which is a great opening song. 'Now I'm Here' if you've seen the live video for it, there's like a Freddie double after he says 'Now i'm here' and 'Now i'm there'. I didn't really appreciate 'Flick Of The Wrist' until I bought the single (in which it was a b-side). So give this one a try and you should like it.<br />The songs that are my favorite and certainly the most curious are 'In The Lap Of The Gods' and 'In The Lap Of The Gods......Revisited'. I thought it was cool how Brian and Freddie did the lower singing; Freddie, Roger and Brian did the middle singing and Roger and Freddie did the high singing. This was something that no other band had even done before (well....that did it and sounded good, anyway)<br />Sheer Heart Attack is one to get, if not to die for. :)
B0000A1RJI|5.0|In a word...AWESOME!!  I've seen this movie three times and listening to the soundtrack makes me want to go see it again!!  You can never get tired of it...  I fell in love with this movie and now it's soundtrack.  The main theme is nowhere near redundant...IT'S AWESOME!  I find myself humming to it all the time.  If you are a collector of great movie soundtracks, do NOT leave this one out!  It is truly spectacular!  Klaus Badelt is a genius!  If you haven't seen the movie or heard this CD, do both or you'll miss out!!
B00007E8V4|5.0|I had previously been a System Of A Down fan, so just after I heard this album had come out I really wanted to hear what it sounded like. I had downloaded a couple songs ..... I think they were 'F**k the System' and 'Mr.Jack' as they were the most popular ones, and I quite liked them. So I saved for a couple weeks and bought the album.... and I didn't take it out of my CD player for 4 months. It was great. 'Pictures' and 'Innervision' got to be my favorites. If you are looking for some 'harmony laden melodies with great eastern influence' (as SystemOfADownOnline.com put it) then I strongly suggest this album. Or if you are just looking for good headbanging music, this pretty much does it.
B00005RYKV|5.0|Bottom line: This movie is incredible. Beat Takeshi is amazing in this gangster flic. I suggest everyone to buy at least 2 copies of this DVD , one for yourself and one for your mother. This movie is a must-have for anyone who enjoys off-beat , original gangster movies.
B000000OAN|4.0|....or maybe it's just because I've heard it too many times ;)<br />This album, obviously, was the most popular, but it isn't Queen at it's best. Although most people have only heard 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (and certainly it's a great song) they should pick up a copy of Sheer Heart Attack or something and see what they think then.<br />On the A-side, 'Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon' is my favorite, as it is an original type song that they didn't have on any other record, a short little nice-ety. 'Seaside Rendevous' was another nice one (Freddie's voice is soo nice in this one)<br />On the B-side my favorite was 'The Prophet's Song' because I loved how they layered the voices in that one part. If I remember Queen, I remember that little part the most. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was alright and 'Love Of My Life' was great too.. In 'Good Company' I like how Brian uses the banjo-ukelele thing.<br />So, in other words, way too over-rated but a great one.
B00000DQSV|5.0|I loved these guys the moment I first heard them in 1982.  I bought all their albums and singles along with the Power Station and Arcadia stuff.  I saw them live in 1984.  I would have followed John Taylor to the end of the earth...or maybe not.  By the time 'Notorious' was released with the other two Taylors missing, I figured it was essentially over for them and I was in no hurry to buy this album.  The FM stations where I lived would never have played DD so I doubt I'd even heard the title track.  While vacationing in Hawaii I needed some new tunes for the walkman and ran across 'Notorious'.  I picked it up and put it down so many times finally deciding just to buy the bloody thing so I could get out of the store!  Never did I expect such a maturing of music.  I had just hit my 20s and was so happy to discover that they seemed to have followed me out of my teens although in saying that by no means would I describe their earlier music as fluff.  Looks aside, these guys had some serious talent.  Fifteen years later, I'm still listening to 'Notorious' and it's one of maybe five albums in my collection that I can listen to from beginning to end and enjoy the experience as much as I did the very first time I listened to it.  Never does it feel like I'm playing something old...this album just doesn't ever seem to date itself for me.  It also reminds me of that vacation every time I listen to it.  I've enjoyed a few DD songs since the 'Notorious' album but nothing compares to that one for me.  With the news that the original five members are reuniting for an album and a tour, I've been O.D.ing on nostalgia lately listening to all the early 80s stuff.  I'm looking forward to hearing what these guys have to give the fans this time around.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Wow. <br />Usually when you turn on the radio these days, all you get blaring out is the same ol' Britney Spears [stuff]. If you are looking for real music folks, and I mean, good, awesome, wickular music....this is it. Every song is original....I don't know, it may just be me and my sore knowledge for this type of music, but i've never really seen anything this good in a long time.<br />I want to explain this album....but I just can't. You have to listen for yourself.
B0000009SM|5.0|It's very difficult to pick a &quot;favorite&quot; Zappa album once you become a fan.  &quot;One Size&quot; is always near the top of my list, however.  There is nowhere even close to a &quot;filler&quot; track on this album.  &quot;Andy&quot; and &quot;Inca Roads&quot; are both simply amazing tunes that simply have to be heard to be believed - if you're not familiar w/ much of Zappa's music, these two tracks will re-define what you think a rock band can sound like.  &quot;San Ber'dino&quot; and &quot;Can't Afford No Shoes&quot; are straight-ahead rock songs by Zappa standards, and along with the slightly more complicated &quot;Florentine Pogen&quot; let you know that this band didn't just play well, they ROCKED.  &quot;Po'jama People&quot; is a more funk-oriented jam tune, with a great bluesy solo by Zappa. &quot;Evelyn&quot; (sp?) is a great weird little interlude between some of the longer tunes on the album - almost as if Zappa is saying &quot;just wanted to make sure I still had your attention&quot;.  Last but certainly not least, the two versions of &quot;Sofa&quot; are absolutely beautiful - great arranging, for a very soulful, yet almost regal sounding tune.  Absolutely perfect.  If you're in the least bit curious about the rock music of Frank Zappa, GET THIS ALBUM!
B000000OAL|5.0|This was the second Queen album I bought (the first was 'A Day At The Races') and I adored it. The A-side was pretty good, 'Great King Rat' had some good guitar pieces and 'Doing All Right' that Smile cover that was WAY better then the Smile version. 'My Fairy King' was my favorite on this side with that nice little ending part. Then the B-side in my opinion was more enjoyable.... even though I always liked the De Lane Lea version of 'Jesus' better then the album one, 'Modern Times Rock n Roll' was the best song Roger wrote until 'A Human Body' the b-side to 'The Game' in 1980. (in my opinion).<br />But yeah, an overall classic Queen one that needs to be heard.<BR>Of course, I could give all of the Queen albums five stars but this one really deserves it.
B00006L85B|5.0|Great album!  Beautiful song selection!<br />The DVD's presentation could have been more sophisticated, a bit too simple for my taste, but it brings with it seven elegant music videos that put you inside the world of Luis Miguel.<br />THE KING!
B00004XPPB|5.0|This is an all around great movie it has it's drama side, violent side, and a funny side. Some of the people i showed this movie to fail to see the comedy behind some of the scenes like in the begining in the social club Lefty and Nicky are having an argument which is a better car a lincoln or a cadillac in that scene the comedy behind it is the way they argue. Another scene thats pretty funny is when Donnie and Lefty are rideing in Donnies car pulling a porsche and when lefty tells donnie to pull over and starts taking donnies stereo apart and loses his scewdriver in the stereo. what you have to do is listen to the way they talk to each other its funny. Also the way Nicky is in the movie with the little smart comments its quite funny... to me anyway.but if you listen to the way they talk to each other and watch lefty always ask donnie for money. But all in all Its a great movie. If your a fan of Mafia Type Movies Which i believe It was either Joe Pistone Or Mike newell or Johnny depp says on the special features (which are totally awsome) its dangerous to categorize it as a mafia flick because its not its more of a love story in sick way or somethin like that youll have to watch the special features to find out what im tryin to say also the deleted are funny as can be - anyway ITS A GREAT BUY YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED TAKE MY WORD FOR IT AL PACINO AND JOHNNY DEPP ARE GREAT TOGETHER IN THE MOVIE AND ALL OF THE OTHERS ANNE HECHE AND MIKE MADSEN AND BRUNO KIRBY ARE ALL GREAT JUST BUY IT AFTER YOU WATCH IT THE ONLY THING YOU'LL REGRET IS YOU DIDNT BUY IT SOONER.
B00007G207|5.0|I am a long time fan of the original 1990 version of Cinema Paradiso.  It was a very touching story of a father and son and the love they shared for each other.  Some reviews on this web site have suggested that the \\"new\\" 51 minute version ruins the beauty and power of the original film.  I feel everyone has missed the point.  In fact it strenthens an already powerful story.  <br />The new footage with Toto finding the older Elena actually serves to demonstrate several points.  First, it reinforces the point Toto made years earlier about the soldier and the princess.  If Toto had left well enough alone, it would have been easier on him.  Instead he will never be with Elena, knows it, and is tormented by the realization that he was so close to having her in the first place.  Secondly, the question must be asked, what would have happened if Toto had ran off with Elena.  Would he have become the successful filmmaker and would their love have lasted?  Probably not on both questions.  He would have by passed his destiny and in the end would have regreted this choice.  Also, their love could never have lived up to his expectations...nothing could have, and he would have been more disappointed by this.  Lastly, the revelation that Alfredo had \\"lied\\" to him does not turn Alfredo into a bad guy or liar.  He gave Elena the choice and she saw it his way.  He loved Toto so much that he wanted him to make the most of his life and not settle.  He wanted him to realize the full potential of his life made a choice entirely out of love for him that in the end was the right choice.  This new version is a wonderful movie and should be viewed seperately from the original since it is basically a whole different movie.  Pick up this dvd...you wont be disappointed.

B00005N5S5|5.0|There are countless ways to describe how I think of this film; one of them is Spectacular! The first in the classic Terminator movie series is a ground-breaking cinematic work of art of absolutely stunning proportions and put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map and made him one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and early 1990s before several commercial duds would temporarily dampen his success later on (Batman & Robin anyone?) until \\"Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines\\" came along. The groundbreaking movie is the story of an extremely bleak future where Los Angeles and much of the world's civilization is wiped out by nuclear Armageddon when a computer program/internet named Skynet, goes out of control, and the machines, under control of it, unleash a reign of nuclear terror and destruction, decimating much of the human (non-machine) population, and taking over much of the world, except for a few surviving humans who have gathered forces to fight against the machines thanks to a rebel leader named John Connor who leads what remains of the human race into ultimately smashing the machines into junk, ensuring victory against them. However, the machines send back a human cyborg 45 years back in time to the year 1984, to kill John Connor, by means of \\"terminating\\" a waitress woman named Sarah Connor, who is the future mother of the human rebel leader, which would result in John never even being born in the first place. In the year 1984, Sarah Connor's life seems like any ordinary life: living as a waitress at a slighltly seedy L.A. Restaurant, and barely balancing a checkbook. She has no idea that it will take a massive turn. A rebel soldier named Kyle Reeves is also sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor, and her 'unborn' son from the emotionless Terminator and thus fighting for the future of humanity. At that point, it is evident that Reeves would not only protect John Connor but in fact, turn out being his father later on. What makes The Terminator even more dangerous is that he is able to copy other peoples voices, and yes, even copy women's voices, making him even more likely to find where his target is. The human cyborg does not feel emotion; it does not feel pain; it cannot be reckoned with. He can blend in with the rest of society as he is part human, part machine, with flesh on the outside, but machine and robot on the inside and all these things make him so much more dangerous to be reckoned with.<br />Parents, be warned! There are truckloads of disturbing violence in this film and also some extremely bloody scenes that will scare young children and I can't blame them, even I have become unsettled when watching this when I was younger but sadly worse stuff has happened in real life. There is one scene which I'm not going to mention for fear of spoilers, that even I had a relatively tough time handling. Occasional profanity also makes this movie one for the more grown-up audiences. However, it also brings to mind, the possibility of what might happen if man and machine do in fact, start fighting each other especially with all of the computer viruses that plague the internet today. It also brings to mind that it is possible to actually build a machine that could do the same things that Terminator actually does in this movie. In top of it all, it is very chilling as the movie's story does brush very closely with reality at the possibility of all of the things happening in this movie actually occurring in real life especially with all of these computer virus attacks that have crippled businesses these past few years although time travel may not be possible because it would likely have messed up the timeline already.<br /><br />This film, while it was a highly ground-breaking film back in 1984, has really begun to show it's age, especially the futuristic battle scenes where the floating spacecraft vehicle looks more like a toy suspended on a string than a realistic looking battle vehicle but this movie was made during a time before the special effects technology would skyrocket not too long afterwards, often to an excessive degree. Also it was filmed and The special effects also kind of look cheesy now due to the time of their creation, but only to a mild degree. The two latter Terminator movies benefited from superior production but while parts of the first Terminator movie have really dated badly, there is no denying that this is still a five star plus movie and I highly recommend buying this for those who want a highly brilliant movie, with violence and action that meshes along with the storyline, as opposed to the brainless, thug war violence of a lot of today's movies (\\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" anyone?). While parts of this movie really show signs of being extremely dated, particularly the futuristic battle scenes in 2029, the low budget spent on making this incredible movie really went into good use thanks in part to a strong story and stunning directing thanks in part to the blossoming talent of James Cameron. \\"Terminator\\" is arguably one of the best movies from the 1980s and also one of the most fascinating and most innovative sci-fi action movies of all time.<br />\\"The Terminator\\" is a highly essential film for the ages. From here through the next two movies, we hear that unforgettable line \\"I'll Be Back!\\". Whether to see cinematic innovation or just simply have fun, or just have some 1980s nostalgia, this movie delivers all of the above and is an essential film and the success of it resulted in two dynamite sequels. It's so unbelievable how James Cameron took the low budget spent on the movie's making and turned what could've been a long forgotten throwaway sci-fi flick into a timeless modern masterpiece. All three of the Terminator movies are masterpieces.

B00005N5S5|5.0|This is a truly spectacular movie for the ages. <br />For a movie made way back in 1984, this was well ahead of it's time and is a classic today. This is my favorite of the three Terminator movies, even though the two sequels are excellent as well. <br />Kyle Reese, is sent back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor from the murderous machine Terminator (Schwarzenegger) whose goal is to kill Sarah and her 'unborn' son John, thus preventing John from even being born. <br />From there, it's a terrifying ride as they flee and fight against the cyborg.<br />This is such an awesome movie and I highly recommend buying it.
0375414053|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read the review in the NY Times and went right out to the bookstore to purchase it.  I could really relate to Kate getting treats together for the class at 2AM in the morning (although that's usually when I'm doing laundry!)  The only thing that disappointed me was how conveniently it all ended .... house in the country.. new job.  Most of us are still struggling in that full-time world.
0385504209|5.0|If you want a page turner, here ya go!  I'm not a big reader but this had me riveted from start to finish.  Very interesting and thought provoking!
B00005JLSE|5.0|It was like watching a broadway show! This movie was so great, I believed I was dancing and singing in the movie! The score, the energy, and the clothes were outstanding. This is one of my favorite movies of all time because of the music, the effort the actors put into the movie, and the great detail in everything. This movie is an A-Plus!
0060930349|1.0|I will first off admit that the book was entertaining and engagingly written, but that the authors right-wing agenda made the reading painfull.  Mr. Johnson's obvious prejudices obscured any accuracies that the text might contain, and renders the book to the \\"feel good about your political bent\\" reading list, and not of much value for any true student of history. Don't get me wrong, I am a registered Republican, and this is not a rant against conservatism, but the tone and FDR/Kennedy bashing in this book is offensive and hardly what I consider the work of intellectual objectivity.
1573229725|4.0|The book started off VERY well.  I was hoping for the scenes to be a little more on the steamy side which is needed for a good lesbian drama.  No such luck!  The plot is great but the book was way too long.  I skimmed Part 2 of the book because the author just rewrites Part 1 through another characters point of view.  Like i said though, the plot was good.
B000002AGM|5.0|I like this considerably more than 'Kind of Blue' (which i really think is Miles for the middle class) ..this album is crisp, clean and well conceived jazz -  kudos to both Gil Evans and Miles, they really produced a solid album.  Along with some of the latter Miles Live albums, i rate this the best Miles jazz album.  Great sound, musical comp, and of course Miles at his best.
B00009RDG9|5.0|Just when you thought Tommy Lee Jones was an out-of-shape old actor reduced to wise-cracker in movies, The Hunted arrives and changes everything.  Tommy does a masterful job with the fight scenes in this movie--which is worth the buckage for the DVD alone.  He's gotta be in his mid 50's, yet he runs and fights like a 20 year old.  What an actor!  He's perfectly believable as a fight trainer.  The plot and execution may not be the best, but I give this movie 5 stars for atmosphere.  The movie isn't full of canned music you normally hear during action scenes.  Instead, the director relies on the sounds of nature.  This movie is a rarity nowadays.  People are so used to the quick action fix and the matrix-style fighting (which is extremely boring the second time around) that they don't see a great movie when it comes along.  I think The Hunted is one of the best of the year, if not for Tommy's performance, at least the director's vision.  The Hunted takes me back to a time when special effects weren't what made a movie.  I'm gonna own this one.
B000002LAB|3.0|Too little of Miles, and too much....ugg...electronically messed up background music.  The producers did a disservice to Miles,and Miles was probably too busy to notice..i guess.A few pieces are nice, but many of them degenerate into jazzpulp(fiction).
0375432302|5.0|This book blew me away! Once I got past the first couple chapters I could not put it down. It reads very much like a movie... Dan Brown's writing style makes it easy to picture the characters and their actions on your mind's \\"theater screen.\\"<br />I highly recommend having a pen and paper handy while you read because you will have a hard time deciding whether to jump on the Net and research the historical facts Mr. Brown has woven into his story, or continue with the book and let the answer unfold through the characters. The facts are amazing and interesting all by themselves and bear further research either way.<br />There are very few \\"good stopping places,\\" so make sure you have plenty of time to read once you start. It's one of those books where you get to the end of a chapter and say \\"I'll just read one more chapter\\" and suddenly it's 4am. If you like solving puzzles, secret societies, adventure and/or religious history this book is for you. It's easy to picture yourself as either of the lead characters because they're just regular people doing their jobs until one day a murder throws them together to uncover one of the greatest mysteries of all time - the Holy Grail.<br />In the book they say the Grail finds you... if this book has found you, honor the call. Even though this is a fiction novel, I hope it opens many eyes and sets many people on their own quest for the truth.

B000000W5P|3.0|I will never be able to think of this album without remembering my guitarist's appraisal (he ran a record store) of it:  \\"Ah...well...you know how Ron Wood's albums sound?\\"  That's the gospel truth, folks.  This was the Stones' first studio album since Mick Taylor's defection, plus it had the coincident added \\"inconvience\\" of Keith's bust for smack, and his lack of material for the album (save for the sublime \\"Before They Make Me Run.\\")  So, of course, Mick, who obviously listens to top-40 radio FAR too much, \\"assumed control\\" of the album - and it shows.  \\"Miss You,\\" the Stones' second attempt at (ARRRGH!!) disco, is the opening track, a place hithertofore reserved for a Stones' album's strongest track - and now here, \\"OOOh, baby, why'd yew wait so long,\\" and \\"Puerto Rican girls dyin' to meet yew.\\"  Hard to believe THAT #%$@ emanated from the same mind that gave us \\"Please allow me to introduce myself,\\" \\"Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields,\\" or \\"Oh, see the storm is threatnin',\\" etc. Mick was, evidentally, just learning to play guitar, because, with the exception of \\"Far Away Eyes (in \\"F,\\" the track that Michael plays piano on), Keef's song, \\"Beast Of Burden,\\" and the proto-headbanger, \\"Shattered,\\" all the songs are in the key of \\"A,\\" a nascent guitarist's favorite key to...\\"compose.\\"  \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\" would be a great Chuck Berryesque rocker, save for the embarrassing ../S&M references.  \\"Just My Imagination\\" is a fairly good cover of a great old Temptations song - and I think Tina Turner must've been listening to this song while she was composing \\"Better Be Good To Me,\\" because you could almost switch the words from one song to the other, and the the guitar riff, right after Tina sings \\"I'm captured,\\" is the same as what Keef plays while Mick is singing, \\"Just my imagination - riff-riff-riff - runnin' away with me.\\"  And let's not talk about the title track; it's pretty funny and a fairly good rocker until Mick gets a bit...\\"politically incorrect.\\"  \\"Some Girls,\\" the album, began \\"Stones-Mach III,\\" the Ron Wood era, and they've, really, just not recuperated since.  Still, mercifully, the \\"sum is greater than the total of the parts,\\" and the tracks like \\"Beast of Burden\\" (with Charlie's \\"50's style-two beat\\" drumming, the country \\"Far Away Eyes\\" (Thank You, Jesus), and, again, Keef's \\"Before They make Me Run,\\" make up for the pandering elements of the album.  And, in closing, I'll be honest.  I HAVE enjoyed myself mightily dancing to or \\"kareoke-ing\\" \\"Miss You.\\"
0671027387|4.0|Deception Point is the first book I read from Dan Brown, because of the name lists on bestseller for Da Vinci Code.  With some what higher expectation, this book does not disappointed me at all.<br />This proves Dan to be a top writer in several ways:<br />- this is an easy to read book.  The major two plots - the war about the next president between two characters, and the certifying of a meteorite in Artic by 4 civilian experts, interweave closely and parallelly throughout the book.  There are many characters involved but with such a good writing skill by Mr. Brown, the characters are clearly developed, and background histories are disclosed in detail.  The reader will never get lost in the complex and air-tight story.<br />- it blends (successfully) both political conspiracy story and scientific story together, and with a very good success.  The war between President Herney and Senator Sexton is not complicate, but sure full of twists and surprises.  You will never know who's the winner until the very end.  On the scientic discovery of the meteorite, it is just like reading a Crichton book that is full of interesting theories and knowledges.  To a lessor extent, there are also love and action elements, making this a very entertaining book to read.<br />I will definitely add Dan Brown on my \\"must read\\" list.

B00005JKN9|1.0|This film aspires favourably as the all-time worst movie that I have ever wasted time watching. One big mess of unbelievable casting, acting and action - set in equally untrustworthy locations, with a non-existent storyline. Overall impression: &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; meets &quot;Spiderman&quot; w/o the music. <br />The weirdest thing is, that the film is barred of morality. As a consequence, it conveys no feelings to the spectator. There are no villains and no heroes - all characters are &quot;bad&quot; to some extent. The violence becomes senseless gore without empathy or sympathy, and the &quot;romantic moments&quot; are reduced to showing of bare flesh in paparazzi style. You're not involved in the action, but are prone to wonder how on earth 2 hours and 45 minutes can feel like an eternity.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I viewed this with my partner as a mistake, and was utterly surprised by the fusion of the Metropolis Genre and Orwellian despair.<BR>This alone was worth the view.<BR>Naturally I was stunned by well done &quot;Gun Kata&quot; and actions scenes. Critics panned it, well I'll pan the critics then. Their ignorance clearly a result of over stimulation and a bubble gum culture dummed down for the masses. <BR>The matrix, among a few has done well to dull the minds of the critics (which they incidently panned in the UK as well)  but this alone proves the critics missed the point of the movie altogether.<br />The superb action scenes were incidental to an excellent plot and a harsh social statement of the human condition. I find it ironic that the point of determining what matters in life was ignored by the critics in what mattered in the movie.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Simply put, this is Beck's best work.  This CD rocks, and contains some of JB's most melodic songs ever put together.  Much of the guitar work is in lower notes (which contributes to a much edgier sound), and each song is exceptionally polished resulting in his best recording.  I have most of Beck's other CD's and this one best demonstrates his different playing speeds, rhythms, and creativity.  A must for Jeff beck fans.

0375757295|4.0|As an avid fan of Jane Austen, I began reading \\"Persuasion\\" with great expectations. Although I cannot say I am dissapointed, I must admit I did not like Persuasion as much as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. <br />First of all, although I sympathized with Anne when he was slighted by her own family and she was taken no notice of in the company of foolish women just because she is not as pretty and \\"fragile\\" as them, maybe because she is not as strong and passionate a character as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, I could not particularly attach myself to her. Still, I read the novel from beginning to the end in a very short time because it has more than enough to keep our interest. Especially the character of Mrs. Croft, the sister of Captain Wentworth is worth notice; because among the \\"ailing\\" and \\"fatigued\\" women of the higher classes of that time,  this woman who walks long distances with her husband, who accompanies him on long sea journeys and takes the reins of their carriage to manoeuvre out of the way of a post is very interesting. In this novel, Jane Austen says quiet a lot of things which can be thought quiet feministic. Well  she says similar things in P&P, for example she makes Darcy say that Elizabeth's complexion is greatly improved after a long walk, when Bingley's sisters criticize her for such an unlady-like behaviour.<br />Another thing about the novel is that we don't really know the feelings of Captain Wentworth. It is true that the letter he writes to Anne at the end is full of love but I didn't feel his passion as I did Darcy's when he proposed to Elizabeth the first time.<br />All in all, I recommend the book to readers who have read Austen's other novels. But as a first read it may not be so enjoyable as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have yet to listen to a whole cd over and over again and not get tired of songs... until this cd came across my hands. I bought the cd because I'd heard a couple songs of their first album, Origin. This cd is beyond belief. It is insane to think of how good it is. I don't usually like women artists but yet this album has great lyrics, guitars, and vocals. It is a mixture of many things but only this cd can really touch the different sorts of music without sounding stupid. Buy this cd, you won't be disappointed!
0783226063|1.0|Having just read the book, I decided to rent the DVD.  What a complete and total disaster.  <br />The only two things I actually enjoyed about this were the designs of the stillsuits and the casting of Max von Sydow as Kynes.<br />The story is so compressed that all sense of scope, depth, and purpose are completely undermined.  The acting alternates between wooden and melodramatic.  The Harkonnens have been transformed into circus freaks.  Nearly everybody is miscast.<br />And worst of all, it's BORING!<br />This movie should have been put on a shelf and never released.
B00009RGBS|2.0|There's alot to be said against this movie, the brutality masked alluringly by sex and lilting voices is depressing.    But the pearl in the stinky oyster is Queen Latifa.   I'd never listened to her before and now I think she's just amazing.   She belts out Mama and you are hooked.   Its worth getting the movie to see her in action.   The rest are quickly forgettable at best.
B0000797IO|1.0|I bought this dvd after reading all the reviews on this site and on other sites saying that this is such a great movie. i watched this movie and thought it was one of the worst movies i had seen and could not believe that i had wasted so much money on it and so many people gave it such a good review. It was meant to be a comedy and i could not see anything that was close to commical in this movie. The most funny thing about this movie is how crap it was.
B000069AUI|5.0|1st thing: coldplay rock 6/5...........<BR>2nd thing: 'farmerloi2' doesn't know jack from jill<br />TO ASK WHETHER I LIKE COLDPLAY'S ALBUMS (OR NOT) IS LIKE ASKING IF I WILL BE INHALING OXYGEN TODAY.........EVERY NOW AND THEN IN THE MUSIC WORLD SOMETHING GOES BANG! AND TURNS EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN..... i.e    C_O_L_D_P_L_A_Y    - 'farmerloi2' (whoever you are) knows the truth and is either in a state of denial over Coldplay making a worthy successor to Parachutes, OR still can't work out exactly what those two things are on the side of his head. A name springs to mind - Manuel. Of course im taking into account that you know what a TV is for....
0385504209|5.0|This guy knows his stuff, this is my second book about Robert Langdon, Angels and Demons was first. I loved it! Dan Brown is the writer of the moment! I could not put down the first or  the second!<br />Read it!
B00004R99L|5.0|i wounder if the writer was doing drugs. I tried reading about writer of the original book but it doesnt mention anything of useful information. It talks about the writer having a relationship with a young girl.<BR>Where would he get these visions from?
B00009W0U4|2.0|I'm a veteran of disturbing cinema and I was expecting a grueling experience -- heck, the dramatic opening credits nearly had me too intimidated to continue watching -- but ultimately the story itself was too simplistic to be truly disturbing, and I was left wondering what the aims were of the film's creator, Gaspar Noe. I'd also seen another of Noe's films (I Stand Alone) and I've now concluded that has nothing to say. He aspires to become merely a notorious director of shocking material. My guess is that his creative \\"method\\" involves simply conjuring up some suckerpunch scene (in the case of Irreversible, there are two) and throwing together sufficient character and plot to make the scene happen. It's revealing to me that the camera swirls and twists -- almost nauseatingly so -- throughout the whole of Irreversible, but remains static in only one scene (the excruciatingly long rape sequence), as though to suggest that this was the only scene that mattered, the only one worth framing properly. Noe is an exploitation filmmaker, but in a world where no one pays attention to shock filmmakers anymore (after all, Perry Farrell said that nothing was shocking fifteen years ago), Noe is forced to imbue his unpalatable material with moral outrage just to get people to pay attention to it. But there is no moral here. Rape is nonsensical. Revenge is nonsensical. The world is cruel. We all knew this going in. I'm reminded of what one critic said about Marilyn Manson: \\"There's nothing as lame or pitiful as contrived outrage, and no band around fails to shock with as much concerted effort as Marilyn Manson.\\" Same goes for Gaspar Noe. If you want to see something really shocking, try Takashi Miike's Audition. Now there's a suckerpunch.
B000009F3Z|5.0|good cd but i must comment quite opposite to one of the &quot; other &quot; reviews... i bought this cd looking for &quot;better musical talent&quot;  in this cd than my other in flames cds. i was not impressed with one of the other reviews, dark tranquility is an awesome band and this is a great cd, but in comparrison to great guitar riffs and talented drum combos and rolls in flames blows them out of the water. the songs &quot;swim,the jesters dance, man made god, pinball map and suburban me by in flames&quot; are pretty much what &quot;melodic&quot; was made for so this isnt gonna be a long review, i think if your looking for for talented melodic death metal in flames is your best choice. and with anything i also suggest you download a couple tunes to see what your getting into. try my quoted ones...<br />Thanks for reading my review.
6305232660|5.0|but it deserves a better DVD!<BR>More features Paramount..please!
B00005QFE5|5.0|Love, devotion, respect, honor. I can't think of other words that could better describe this beautiful movie. <BR>Pros: Gorgeous cinematography, acting &amp; directing<BR>Cons: Maybe a little slow moving for those who have been watching too much of Hollywood.
B00000JLWW|3.0|Paramount shoud release it again....<br />Great Film...no problems, but poor DVD!<br />Do it again, and I will buy it again...
0385504209|2.0|A few friends told me that they couldn't put this book down. I couldn't put it down either, but when I finally did finish it, I was pretty disappointed. I found some of the clues to be transparent , almost insulting. I am so DONE with the 0h-look-we've-fallen-in-love-while-chasing-crime/rescuing-the-world thing. Please.
B00005JLH2|4.0|.Although its not a Spike Lee production,the movie \\"Drumline\\"'s college scene does reflect a \\"Spike Lee\\" perceptions of how the average college student emote and what the average college staff lecturer/professor/administrator looks like ....on  the superlatives good,better and best :the plot cannot be outdone(it is novel),but the sterotypes of cheerleader costumes and what the average professor/student looks like could be updated...all the actors 'generally speaking' did a fine job and was a great lesson against pompousness and for team work in its theme\\"one drumline,one voice\\".
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is simply brilliant. One of the most... haunting albums of all time. And yes, &quot;haunting&quot; is the only way to describe it. There is absolutely no way to explain this album to someone... they have to hear it for themselves. This album is one of the only ones where I can listen to every song without skipping one, and is also one of the only albums which somehow gets better with every listen. Paranoid Android is perhaps my favorite song of all time... But its closely contested by Karma Police and Subterranian Homesick Alien.
B000068MFS|1.0|During this movie, I felt like Alex in the Clockwork Orange during his treatment.  This movie made me want to tear my hair out, move to Nepal, and become a Krishna.  If I had a choice between pulling my own teeth out one by one and watching this movie, I wouldn't think twice before I reached for the pliers.  John Cusack is to humans what Eboli is to kidneys.  If you spend money on this movie, you are stupid.
B00005JMC6|5.0|Don't let all the \\"tribe\\" talk turn you away.  This is a modern day movie, about the remnants of a tribe of people in New Zealand.<br />Pai is the grand-daughter of the tribal chief.  He wanted a grandson.  Pai's twin brother died at birth, so there's just Pai.  The grandfather spends the whole movie trying to keep Pai from becoming what she must...<br />It's a struggle on many levels: the young tribal members who think the old ways are silly and stupid, but in the end embrace them anyway; the chief who wants to groom one of the first-born sons to be the new chief, but winds up with a little girl; the father who failed to produce a son to further the line of chiefs, and runs away to start a new life.<br />This movie is drama at its finest.  Pai, played by the adorable Keisha Castle-Hughes gives a fantastic performance.  All the performances are strong, the Niki Caro's directing is superb.  The story will pull you and and not let go.  I didn't look at my watch once.  If you're looking for fast action or thrilling adventure, go somewhere else.  This movie comes from the heart.
B0000A4GAK|5.0|Recorded in 2000 but shelved due to the HOB record label folding, SS is a incredible listening experience.  All instrumental except for the one track with Gregg Allman vocals, SS is truly a jazz album more than anything.  Derek and Kofi (flute) lock-in over the top of Yonrico, Todd, and Bill McKay (now with Leftover Salmon) to blend several genres and textures with ease.  This is the real deal.  Miles Ahead (pardon the reference) of Joyful Noise (2002), this album accurately reflects the dTb at one stage in their development.  I can recommend this CD to jazz, blues, and rock fans.  The crescendo during the &quot;Rastaman Chant&quot; is very cathartic, if that doesn't prompt a &quot;Soul Serenade&quot; in you, then get to a doctor soon.  The complex &quot;Afro Blue&quot; (written by Mongo Santamaria and made famous by Coltrane) is a gem as is the last tune &quot;Sierra Leone&quot;, which has Derek on the sarod.  It's the dTb version of &quot;Little Martha&quot; and worth the price of the CD.  Finally, the Gregg Allman guest vocals on &quot;Drown In My Own Tears&quot;, I feel like I am in church with Ray Charles everytime I hear that number.  You won't be disappointed in the least with this masterpiece.  Also, get out and see this band live when they roll into your neighborhood.  You will be talking about it for years to come.<br />Enjoy!
B00004T0P1|4.0|Howard isn't one of my always-must-have composers, but on the basis of this CD at least, perhaps he ought to be.  The second track, &quot;The Egg Travels,&quot; perfectly demonstrates the range of the music you'll find here.  &quot;The Courtship&quot; has a bouncy traditional-African sound to it, while &quot;The End of Our Island&quot; is eerie and tension-building, rising to a brief, thundering dissonance of volcanic eruption.  &quot;Raptors/Stand Together&quot; successfully evokes an action-filled attack sequence--at one point you can almost &quot;see&quot; the steadily approaching feet of the carnivores pounding against the ground.  &quot;Finding Water&quot; is filled with the joy and relief the travellers must feel; &quot;The Cave&quot; has a mystical, marvelling feel to it.  And so it goes.  Howard clearly immersed himself in the rough cut of the movie and came to know it well.  Definitely worth your time.
B00005JM09|5.0|I cannot decide which was better, this one or the 2nd one, but regardless, a definite must buy when it comes out on DVD.  I have never known a movie to have so much action, and plus it being original.  Car chases get old, but this movie knew how to do it.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I will admit.  Before I bought this, I had the 2000 bootlegs, and so I was familiar with most of the songs.  Songs like Grieveance, Insignificance, God's Dice, etc., were already familiar to me.  And I was disappointed to find, for many of them, the live versions were better songs.  Not that they are bad songs here, but they lack the energy.  This is in no way a bad album, and many of these songs are true classics.  If you have a good stereo system, you can really appreciate just how much was put into the sounds.  If you don't, then this CD just feels hollow.  And of course, like any post 1994 Pearl Jam album, if you expect to hear another version of Ten or VS, you won't find it here...
B00008PC2O|5.0|I used to think this movie could never be surprassed until the 3rd one came out, so I'm not sure which one I like more.  But this movie just blows me away with the extreme originality and brilliance of the plot.  Definite classic.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|After 6 years in the studio, in life, and millions of fans wearing out their copies of The Dance, Fleetwood Mac finally has released their long-awaited new album.  And of course, it's one really great album, living up to all the expectation...<br />The only noticable loss is Christine McVie's songwriting, which gave some relief to the Buckingham-Nicks songs.  This album goes from either Lindsey to Stevie.  <br />This CD won't so much remind you of an old Fleetwood Mac, as make you remember what you like in the first place.  Which makes it a totally fresh musical experience...
630471193X|4.0|I only gave it 4 because it seems this movie idea is rehatched all the time.  From this movie all the way up to present day with movies like K-Pax and Powder.  Awesome movie, just not very original.
0385504209|4.0|Overall a good read, it goes by very quickly and can turn into a page turner.  Unlike some other &quot;page turners&quot; this one does require the reader to pay close attention to figure out the case.  Some of the aspects of the book were a bit of a let down as they were rather predictable, but probably seemed more so because of the unexpected twists and turns the Brown offers.  A good book if you are on the road and want something to read at the airport.
B000067FP7|5.0|The whole idea was great.  Unlike Critters (a personal favorite actually), it put a good comic twist on the creatures, and gave them more personality, and rules, too.  Critters was more in the label of horror, and Gremlins more in the label of Fantasy.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Perfect Time Capsule of the American 60's rock scene. Let's hope that Rhino puts out another collection. Would have loved to have seen Bobby Fuller's &quot;I Fought The Law&quot; in this set, although I don't know if that is garage rock. This set is a breath of fresh air compared to close minded &quot;Classic Rock&quot; radio stations that play the same songs over and over. Throw away your radio and put on Nuggets!
B00005O438|5.0|I cannot express how much this movie kicked so much booty.  I love dogs, and when one goes evil?  How is that not entertaining?  Only thing I didn't like was that in the book, Tad died, and didn't in this movie.  Just because Tad dying was kind of the moral of this story.  Stephen King is phenomenol, and I'd wonder what he'd have to say about how the movie makers did this.
B00004RFCM|1.0|the title of this review should say it all. the show basically concerns over-the-hill hag (Samantha), brittle wallflower (Miranda), hatched-face (Carrie), and pretty-sweet one (Charlotte) as they date. Its no wonder the three ugly, attempting-to-sell-them-selves-to-thebest-looking-preppie ones can't find anyone who'd love them, while the pretty one manages to snag 2 husbands by the end of the show. <br /> Women try to pretend this is about feminism. Its not. Its about how being slut and going for outside appearances in men leave them, well, jilted (witness how much of a plaything Carrie turns into for Mr. Big- he's a jerk, but a handsome jerk, so she'll do anything for him). <br />The more you watch this show, the emptier they become. sort of like the political rhetoric feminists use to defend it.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I love this movie.  It just gets right into the action at the beginning and I love that.  Not the best of the trilogy series, but still great.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album is too often deified on a lofty pedastal. Unfortunately, many villify it because of that deification. Some people just won't love what everyone else is loving regardless of the object's loveability. And it is good to love this album. Being aware of the subjectivity in judging music, let's just say it is a wonderful album.<BR> This is their most highly produced album as George Martin was at the time practically the 5th Beatle. Of course this is Pop music, but not strictly commercial. There were no singles released from this album. The two singles they released in 1967 later appeared on Magical Mystery Tour. This fact fueled the idea that this was a concept album. But there is no thematic link or continous musical thread running through this album. The songs are just played without breaks. That's not a concept.<BR> The truly great songs here -'A Day in Life,''She's Leaving Home,''Lucy in the Sky,'the title track and 'With a Little Help' cemented the reputation of this album. But the rest of the tracks are really pretty ordinary. This isn't their best album, but it is the album that showed the greatest musical advances from the preceding one. Revolver actually has more great songs than Sgt.Pepper, but it is simpler music from a simpler time.
B000067FP8|5.0|I think this movie made a huge attempt to be funny and witty, and I don't think it was that funny.  I just love watching the Gremlins, and Gizmo's whole gimmick is great.  Definite classic.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|The reason I feel so strong about all three of godsmacks albums is the fact that they have'nt changed anything, and with the new album faceless they did it again.  This album is all hard, dark, and just plain rocken, I listened to the album and realized a lot of these songs i can actually relate to, and im pretty sure that many other listeners feel the same way.  Also this album rocks hard just like the other albums if not harder, hard drum beats, with even harder solos and rifts, and some extreamly dark and deep volcals, you can't go wrong with the purchasing of this album.  And the song Serinity, it's just another way godsmack is keeping with the voodoo tradition.  Now if you haven't obtained this album yet i urge you to go out and do so now, this album is perfect for any metal fan.  And for the rest of you godsmack fans, i'm sure you feel the same way when i say,&quot;i can't wait to see what they come up with next.&quot;
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Too too many people have tried making horror spoof movies, and this is the only one that did it well.
B00009RDG9|1.0|Ths movie is not only silly, it is stupid. I gave it one star because it has name actors. It deserves a negitive 50 stars. Military killer being hunted by the never had to kill trainer.<BR>The movie is just about killing. Kind of eludes to a plot but never works on or off the plot. I figure the disk will make a cool little frisbee being that the movie is so stupid.
B000022TSW|5.0|So hilarious, and I am amazed they did the movie with a \\"musical\\" twist.  Never would've expected it.  I love how movies have several plots, which also have back plots, and in the end they all tie together.  Like Cartman's cussing chip, the Satan/Saddam love thing, etc.  Genius from Matt/Trey.
B000069AUI|4.0|i like both of their albums and they came to dallas a few months back..their music is fun and beautiful and they dont sound like radiohead...and the whole band is talented.i will probably buy more of their music in the future and i dont think they are going to quit too soon..but if they do chris can go solo and we will all love him and suport him yay !
B000075BFK|2.0|This is 2pac's worst album.The beats are pop and so new school.
B00008J4P5|4.0|well what atracted me to the white stripes is meg white and her beauty..upper torso and lower...she rocks my world and jack is lucky!...but i finaly got into their music when that dead leaves song came out but it didnt make me want to buy the album.but when 7 nation army came out and seeing the kick a$$ video made me want to go down to borders and spend all my money.i am pleased with the album and i listen to it often and i give it 4 stars..i think its good to add other instruments to the music cause that guitar and drum beat gets boring..i think this is some what like the white album magnatude...i do recommend it to people but listen to it before buying it
B00009W0WM|5.0|What can you say about this film that hasn't already been said?<br />This digitally redone version is a must for any serious movie buffs collection.<br />The extra's are nice to have. They are a litle limited, but the film is 60 years old. It's little hard to find people in the film anymore.
B00005QIPH|1.0|ok i think this band from the first was overated big time...i do admit i have about half of their songs downloaded from winmx and i do admit some of the songs are decent enough to jam to when you are high.i think the vines is alot better band ..and their songs do sound the same and can be boring to the ear..and the vocals of that front man that looks like a bloated guppy fish from south america can get anoying but hey i gave it 1 start that means i like it a bit...if i didnt give it any stars that means i hate it and we wouldnt be here talking .(laughs).anyways go at your own risk buying this album...and i rcommend that you listen to it first before you buy and im not looking forward to their next realeas..BUT ! i do like the name of the songs i think they are great and that is probably why i listen to it from download..now i didnt buy it so...
B00000JMQE|5.0|Forget Judy Garland in 1939, move over 'cause Faruzia Balk is a all fingers and thumbs up Dorothy. This isn't a musical and a darker sequel to The Wizard of Oz.

B00006F7S4|3.0|i think this is best album yet..very mature..even though i like his other stuff this is the best...its beautiful and its the best folk music ive heard in a long time..it reminds me of the beatles...its a amazing album and you should definatly buy it..beck is so cute to (winks)
B00005JKHN|5.0|This is a great DVD! It had been such a long time since I had seen this movie that it was almost like seeing it for the first time.  The animation in this movie is awesome, classic Disney, very detailed and engaging, in a clean and simple style.<br />The remastering is perfect, they didn't try to remake the movie.  They preserved the movie and enhanced the image so that it looks more seamless, almost real.<br />This is a great story, one that people of all ages can enjoy.  I highly recommend this DVD, no collection will be complete without it.
B00003CX9E|1.0|I have heard for years that this movie is innovative, a bechmark of quality, amazing, etc. I really don't see it. Does anyone actually care at all about any of these characters? Quite honestly, by the time the end came, I was thrilled that this clown bought it - what a piece of self serving nothing. This is the kind of writing I would have done in college for a class titled Pretense 101. Give me Captain Ron or Army of Darkness anyday.
B00004XONN|5.0|'Kid A,' the first Radiohead album to follow the band's critically acclaimed 1997 opus 'OK Computer,' follows their new path toward experimentation, but only after taking a dramatic detour.  At the time of its release, 'Kid A' was unrecognizable as a Radiohead work: it shunned guitars and the \\"conventional\\" rock archetype and replaced them with ambient keyboards, synthesized instrumentals, and a distorted Thom Yorke vocal that, as evidenced in the title track, was at times frighteningly indiscernible.  <br />When put on paper, it is quite shocking to note that the album's first guitar does not even *appear* until the fourth track.  This, however, simply allows the band to show their collective prowess in other ways.  The album quickly unfolds its many melodic layers: it opens with a rich keyboard riff, layered amid Yorke's vocal percussion-on-playback, that lulls the audience into a spaced-out bliss; a pounding bass line introduces \\"The National Anthem\\" and ends up competing with a frenzied, out-of-tune saxophone and trumpet jam; then segues into the U2-like guitar and similarly out-of-tune string arrangement of \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" that both evolve into an achingly beautiful symphony of temporary belonging.<br />Yet this back-and-forth movement, continuing until the astonishing Disneyesque chorus of the album's \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" ending, is not just limited to the album's music; Yorke's comparable lyrical schizophrenia also influences it.  \\"Everything in its right place,\\" he sighs on the first track, and we believe it--until faced with the submissive uncertainty of \\"How To Disappear . . .,\\" where he moans, \\"I'm not here / This isn't happening.\\"  \\"Idioteque\\" has a contradictory idea: Yorke repeatedly shouts over the song's hydraulic beats that \\"We're not scaremongering / This is really happening, happening!\\"  And when he plaintively explains during the ebb-and-flow of \\"In Limbo,\\" \\"I'm lost at sea / Don't bother me / I've lost my way,\\" the listenerbegins to realize that they are indeed witness to another masterpiece along the lines of 'OK Computer.'  The album's voice wavers between frantic and near-violent lyrical pictures to a more subdued, third-person view of events to illustrate a tortured soul looking for its \\"right place\\" in the world.<br />Perhaps Yorke and company come to find that the beauty in finding one's place, and especially the music that accompanies this search, is the gray area that lies in between.  Whatever the point of 'Kid A,' its deviant experimentation, while jarring at first, turns out to be essential to Radiohead's artistic evolution.  The album itself is a magical and complex wonder--of musical creativity, lyrical simplicity, and the constant battle within one's own mind--compacted into a mere ten songs, all of which work together to fly the listener through their gorgeous, sometimes bizarre, and altogether emotionally resonant images.
B00002E23E|4.0|This DVD improves on the sound quality a little from the vhs version...The concert footage is great considering the year and methods of recording used at the time...Remastering and noise reduction does make some improvement from the original...I personally loved the dream sequences, and: how does a song you like get too long? I liked this almost as much as pink floyd's ,&quot;The Wall.&quot; So true fans that know what rock'n'roll and life is all about should love it!!!Life is way too short for miniscule criticisms from those way beyond being experts...Enjoy the good times when they are available, and this is definitely one of them!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I purchased 3 new CD's last week but haven't been able to listen to 2 of them because I simply cannot stop listening to &quot;Chariot.&quot;  DeGraw is fantastic and mark my words, is the next big thing!  In a time when so many musicians are selling out to mainstream pop, DeGraw manages to keep a unique sound while remaining universally appealing.  The tracks range from stirring piano ballads (Belief, More Than Anyone) to edgy rock (Chemical Party, I Don't Want to Be) and everything in between.  I keep listening to the album trying to guess what the next single will be but I can't-they are all just so good.  His voice even reminds me a little of Stevie Wonder on certain tracks. (More Than Anyone) Bottom line-go get this album, you won't be disappointed!
1878424114|5.0|This book is exactly as this review is titled. Thanks Deepak!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is the best album to ever come out. The songs runnin with<BR>the devil, aint talkin bought love, eruption, and you really got me are the best tracks.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|Pumping Iron essentially follows four bodybuilders, two professional (Arnold Schwarzenegger & Lou Ferigno) and two amatuers (Mike Katz & Ken Waller)as they train and compete for their sport's top prize, Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe, respectively. The setting is 1975 and the contests take place in Pretoria, South Africa. <br />There are also several vignettes describing the backgrounds of the competitors listed above as well as Franco Columbo. In addition to the background of the main competitors, we get to see a side of them that is unknown to the audience (at that time) - such as Arnold's use of psychology against opponents and his unsatisfied thirst for victory. <br />Visually, the training at Gold's Gym in Venice,CA and the posedown at the contests, are stunning.<br />Overall, this is an excellent DVD to own. If you are a bodybuilding fan, this will undoubtedly provide you with motivation and insight. If you are not a fan, this may be what makes you one.
0679745653|5.0|The name Holi Golightly stands as a paramount in the XX Century culture. As a character, she define fashion, charm and desired, and she has lived in our imagination since when the movie was released. But before the movie there was the book. Written by Truman Capote, `Breakfast at Tiffany's' is one of the best novellas ever written in English. The charm, the style, the passion, all is there.<br />This is more or less the book that defines the glamorous New Your in our mind. The city is virtually a character, as important as Holi's cat, so to speak. Its urbarn landscape is pictured in our minds as a happy place, where one can help but having fun whenever one wants. At least this is what we get from the protagonist's behaviour.<br />Capote's style is full of charm and passion, and the length of the story makes it precise and almost flawless.  Maybe we wouldn't have succeded had he written a long novel about Holi. Things and people pops up in her life and a few pages later they are gone and forgotten. Lucy are the ones who had the luch to meet her.<br />The other three stories in this book are quite good not, although not as nearly as famous as `Breakfast'. `House of Flowers' tells a story about love and how much we sometimes give up in order to be with the one we like. It is a story of a girl who is trying to find her place in the world, but all she finds is not so many good people. Those people are not bad, they just aren't good. `Diamond guitar' is about two convicts who become friends and how important this friendship is for them in order to survive the difficulties of jair. But, of course, something will came up and may --or may not-- set them appart. The last story `A Christmas Memory' is a little jew that should be saved for Christmas time. It is about the unexpected friendship about an old woman and a seven-year-old boy.<br />To sum up, the four stories in this edition deal with misfits, that are trying to survive in a wild society that does not accept too much poetry and sweetness. This book is a high achievment for world wide literature. And later, with `Breakfast at Tiffany's' an achievment for the cinema.poetry and sweetness. This book is a high achievment for world wide literature. And later, with `Breakfast at Tiffany's' an achievment for the cinema.
0201485672|5.0|The refactoring concept fits perfectly with extreme programming (XP).<br />XP (aka ready-fire-aim) recommends that developers get the solution coded and working ASAP (without big-up-front-design or analysis-paralysis) and then (shed your inhibitions; you won't really understand the problem until you've coded it) gradually improve on the design by refactoring the code.<br />This very accessible book has contributions from Kent Beck, John Brant, William Opdyke, and Don Roberts.<br />The author uses fragments of Java code to demonstrate refactoring.<br />The book contains a section on code \\"smells\\" that identify ugly code and a catalog of about 50 refactoring patterns, diagrammed using UML and documented per the template popularized by \\"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\\" by Erich Gamma et al.<br />In his book \\"Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change,\\" Kent Beck has this to say about Martin Fowler's book \\"The reference for refactoring.

0790742780|2.0|I loved the premise of this movie, sort of a more complex version of Deathwish but by the end I wish I was watching Chuck Bronson instead.  It's at the fast food restaurant that Michael Keaton goes from being believably and admiribly vigilante-like to just being a crazy who snaps ..... but then he goes back to harassing old rich guys on golf courses and has you kind of on his side again.  Then you find out he's been going nowhere for a month, he screams at his kid, etc.  You want to root for him and then he does something over the top (and although that may sound like its making the character more developed, it's really not)  I think that had Michael Keaton stood on that line between good guy/bad guy rather than just weaving back and forth the film would have been much mor charged and unsettling.  Also I don't mention Bobby Duvall because, even though he's always a great actor, his storyline is boring and don't care about his wife or his retirement.  Rent Deathwish instead and get guilty thrills out of Bronson shooting countless street punks.
B00005JKG5|2.0|I was 3 or 4 when this movie came out so I never got to see it until now.  I'm into b-boying (breakdancing) and that's why I got this DVD.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack is top-notch for a movie from 1983.  The movie had an extremely weak plot.  Like others have said, what is Hannah's relationship to Alex?  Why did she go to confessional all the time and then have sex with her bf 2 minutes later?<br />My biggest gripe is what happened to the break-dancing scene?  I've seen that part of the movie in numerous break-dancing tapes and the scene in the DVD was much shorter.  I mean they showed Crazy Legs 3 times, Frosty once, and the 2 poppers, but where was Prince Ken Swift?  This movie is supposedly what brought break-dancing into the mainstream back in the early 80s, but yet the DVD which has no features at all, shortens it a lot.<br />This DVD gets a generous 2-stars from me and only because of the good audio.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|Casper is a great family film. Christina Ricci is funny and a t her best. I like the part where Fatso dresses up as Dr. Harvey's Wife! :)
B00005JMCR|3.0|For fans or the notoriously raunchy \\"American Pie\\" series, a certain amount of doubts arise when considering whether or not to see this, the third insallment in the series.  Considering that the second movie was a definite step back from the first, it would be only logical that the next sequel would be even less funny.  Add that to the fact that half of the original cast is missing from this one and things don't look good from the start.  The result though, is very different from what one would expect when following this line of thinking.<br />Somehow, the creators of the \\"American Pie\\" series were able to dig deep and wrench the last few satisfying drops of comedy from this franchise...with of course one catch.  You will enjoy this movie if you are a fan of the character of Stifler.  Despite the wedding based theme, he is the true main event and the star of the show.  Of course we still have the embarrassing situations that Jim manages to get himself into, the uncomfortable fatherly advice of Jim's dad, and the pseudo intellectual posturing of Finch, but through it all Seann William Scott's Stifler character is front and center and makes the most of it.  With the exception of the very funny opeing scene, Stifler is involved in all of the funniest moments that \\"American Wedding\\" has to offer, and there are quite a few of them.<br />\\"American Wedding\\" isn't quite equal to the original American Pie, but for fans of this series and this type of comedy, it will not dissapoint.  By the way, do not judge this movie by its preview, unlike just about every other comedy, \\"American Wedding\\" saves its funniest moments for the actual movie.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Like everyone else, I waited in rapt anticipation for this one.  The continuation of the Star Wars epic in prequel.  But then I didn't realize that Lucas, having been taken prisoner and apparently brainwashed by evil representatives of the Empire, had been ruthlessly forced to see his loyal followers as nothing more than Star Wars-starved nincompoops who would take in anything with the Star Wars logo slapped on it.<br />It started out okay and then, with the introduction of Jar Jar Binks, easily the most unbelievable and ludicrous character that Lucas has ever cast, I realized that all was lost.  The majesty (and, yes, I mean majesty) of the first three installments (Episodes IV, V and VI) of the Star Wars story were diminished by this one.<br />Holy cow!  Kill off the most interesting character in the whole story, Qui-Gon Jinn?  What's that all about?  And Ewan McGregor?  What's going on there? Ewan needs to stick with shallower roles opposite shallower actors like Nicole Kidman (Okay, so she finally got an oscar.  But, hey, since when did the Academy know anything?)  Given McGregor's poor acting, I half way expected him to launch into a tone-deaf song or for Ms. Kidman to come cavorting across the screen as a half-dressed space trollop.  It might have redeemed his dreary performance.<br />And what is this using the force to push apart droids?  If that is how easily it can be done then throw down the light sabers and push the heck out of everyone!  It would be like Indiana Jones first fighting the black-turbaned swordsmen for several minutes and then pull his gun and take the easy way out.  But wait, that's what Lucas intended in the first place.  It was Harrison Ford (our long lost Han Solo) who determined that the gun was quicker and mightier than the sword.<br />The final sequence, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan's duel with a double-light-saber-wielding Darth Maul, brought me back a little.  On pins and needles I thought that perhaps victory would be snatched from the jawsfor defeat and a boorish movie spared by a good scene.  Maybe something surprising would happen!  Maybe a flying toaster would appear and save the day! <br />It started well.  The scene was well choreographed and believable (in Star Wars standards).  <br />And then things took a decidedly predictable turn for the worse.  Qui-Gon unexpectedly takes a light saber in the abdomen and lies dying.  But wait, Obi-Wan has fire in his eyes, grinding his teeth at his horned foe and the apparent murderer of his mentor.  The two glower at each other menacingly--in fact they glower phantom menacingly. The force field drops and Obi-Wan engages the evil Dart Maul.  Some first class light saber play ensues.  There is hope.<br />But then, one two and through and through (to borrow a phrase from Lewis Carroll) Obi-Wan, the hope of Jedi Knights everywhere, slips up, misses an important parry and ends up hanging in an air shaft while Darth Maul traipses back and forth above him like a deranged rooster.<br />Now is the chance!  Now surely Maul will reveal himself to the helpless Jedi, just as he had promised his master, Darth Sidius, earlier in the movie.  But the cat must have his tongue.  He prances stupidly on the edge of the shaft and says NOTHING!  What is going on here?  I recalled the wonderful dialogue between Darth Vader and this same Obi-Wan, (though several years older and much more convincingly acted by Sir Alec Guiness).  <br />But wait.  There is STILL hope.  Obi-Wan, using the force, vaults from his precarious perch, summons his master's light saber in mid-flip and lands in front of his ruddy-faced foe.  However, before he can utter a word of appropriate dialog (such as \\"You killed my master, you horned toad from Hades!\\" or \\"You scratch that rash and it will spread!\\") Obi-Wan applies his light saber and sends Maul plummeting to his bisected doom.  And with his two-pieced fall the chance for a glorious ending for Star Wars Episode I went down the tubes as well.<br />Whiletitled Episode I, this movie is easily the fourth best in the Star Wars series. Stick with The Empire Strikes Back or with Return of the Jedi, my two favorites, or the original Star Wars (Episode IV).
B00005JM02|2.0|I saw this movie late in the game, after it had already grossed a gazillion dollars, after I had heard everyone rave about how good it was, and after I realized that it was the only true, bonafide blockbuster of the summer.  So naturally I figured Pixar had created another movie which was on par with \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"A Bug's Life\\", both of which I very grudgingly admit that I liked.  What I saw was a very average movie with a few chuckles and a few neat visual effects.  Was I watching the same movie?  Are the masses THAT easily entertained? or does Pixar have some kind of mind contral over 90% of the population?<br />In the past, no matter how corny or phony feel-good a Pixar movie was, you could count on a decent amount of clever and witty jokes to make the whole thing entertaining.  It is precisely that cleverness that is almost entirely missing from \\"Finding Nemo\\", making it a mediocre movie at best.  Instead, viewers are given the goofball antics of the Ellen DeGeneres voiced Dory, and the Abbott and Costello type bickering between Dory and Albert Brooks' Marlin.  This type of humor is clearly aimed more towards children, and in turn \\"Finding Nemo\\" lacks that crossover appeal between adults and children that all of its predecessors had.<br />In addition, the all too familiar Disney/Pixar themes are expounded on once again ad naseum and are beginning to wear thin. Personally I have become tired of having a multi-billion dollar corporate conglomerate tell me how one little person/fish/bug/toy/whatever can overcome even the most terrible adversity as long as they believe in themselves.  Perhaps I wouldn't have had time to explore such cynical thoughts had the story, humor or jokes held my attention, but the fact is they didn't.  It may may be time for Pixar to stop recycling the same story disguised in different forms and try something truly different and original in their next movie.
6304698623|5.0|Not only is the story of Sara Crewe heart-warming and beautiful, but this particular film version is visually magnificent.  I watch this film quite frequently because it's so completely wonderful:  the mood is conveyed perfectly through the performances, the beautiful setting, and the incredible cinematography.  It leaves the viewer with such a wonderful feeling when the viewing is done.  Additionally, this film has one of the best soundtracks ever, which I also own and which gets regular rotation in my CD collection.<br />A Little Princess can be appreciated by any lover of film, as well as by any little girl who loves a good tale.  This is an excellent film, and is well worth the low purchase price.  I highly recommend it.
B000096H33|5.0|There are two versions of this release, the US Version from Rhino, and the Import Version which includes a bonus DVD.  I bought the DVD/Import version and I'm glad I did.<br />The CD is the same in both versions, but the DVD gives you a taste of what Oldfield may have planned for yet another future release.  One of the advantages of his re-recording of this masterpiece is that he now has a high end master which he can re-mix in newer audio formats as they come along.<br />The DVD is only about 9 minutes long, but it does contain a short animated video and an intense audio mix of a couple of tracks in a 5.1 audio format.  It would seem to me that producing the entire release in a high end audio format such as DVD Audio or SACD is the next logical step.<br />One listen to the 5.1 DVD on your surround system and you're hooked.
B00005JLXE|2.0|I admit to not being a comic book fan, but agree there have been some excellent movies based on them including Spiderman, Superman, and X-Men.  I don't think Daredevil will fall into that category. <br />The movie is dark and reminiscent of the original Batman movie.  Affleck is believeable as Matt Murdoch, a lawyer who as a young boy is blinded by a toxic chemical spill.  The character turns to a vegilanti after seeing his father killed by hired thugs.  The movie is slow to start, has not predictable wire fight sequences, and lacks a concrete story line.  Or more importantly tries to tie too many loose ends up in one story.  Murdoch discovers the man that kills his father is the same man that is running the cities organized crime ring and hires the hit on his love Electra.  Again reminiscent of Batman.  <br />I wouldn't bother with this one.
0790729628|5.0|I have viewed Blade Runner many times, both in the voice over version and director cuts.  I have to admit I like the directors cut better.  Nuff said about that.<BR>It is one of the very few films I watch frequently and it never loses it's edge. The casting was perfect. The music by Vangelis an integral and outstanding score. The visuals outstanding! Whoever the editor was, god bless you sir.  <BR>Rutger Hauer as Roy--- Perfect!!<BR>Revalent then as today, the movie begs the question of what exactly defines &quot;life&quot; and from what perspective do we &quot;humans&quot; really understand it.  It's also a big a polk in our collective gut because at the end, it is the androids who draw our sympathy, not the humans!<BR>I can only tell you this:<BR>When it rains for days I put this movie on, and for some reason I can't wipe out the memory of &quot;Roy&quot; saying:<BR>&quot;...all these memories lost... forever, in time, like tears in the rain&quot;.
B000089RVX|5.0|Before i start i just have to admit that this is my first review here on amazon, i don't like to review things because i'm basically too lazy to write one. This album has inspired me to write this review and that right there says alot!<br />I have never liked a full album before, but i loved every single song in this album! YUP ALL OF THEM (and im not exaggerating). the female lead singer has a \\"larger than life\\" voice that i can listen to all day without getting bored.<br />Heres a list of all the songs in order of most favorite to the not so favorite.<br />1-Going Under. *My favorite song, go watch the video it's great ;) *<br />2-Bring Me To Life. *I remember when i first watched the video it was late at night and i was feeling kinda sleepy but the song was so good i stood up, got a pen and wrote the name of the song and layed back on the couch. It was that good!*<br />3-My Last Breath. *wow*<br />4-My Tourniquet. *Lyrics are kinda in the weird side in this song but has an amazing melody*<br />5-My Immortal. *man that girl's voice is so (how can i describe it ?) ... Immortal.*<br />6-Haunted. *i never thought a song could be scary before, but in the good way (if there acutally is a good way :S )*<br />The rest of the songs are amazing too.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<BR>Buy this CD you wont regret it if you really gave it a chance.
0452282152|5.0|The subject of this story of the late 1600's is the girl who eventually poses for a famous Dutch artist, but the axis is art itself, how it elevates us, and, to some degree, how it can destroy us. Author Tracy Chevalier cleverly capitalizes on the scant information we have on the artist and the absence of any information on the girl herself. In this story, the subject of the portrait turns out to be an unfortunate young girl who is forced by circumstances to work as a maid in the artist's household. It is an era of class consciousness, where a lowly maid has to work hard, tolerate most anything, and watch her words carefully. To make matters worse, a hateful nemesis forms in one of the artist's young daughters. When the maid is drawn into the artist's world, tension builds as she first becomes a kind of muse, helping the artist with his art, then increases as she becomes an object of art herself. Though she's desired by the artist and by a proprietor, both with different kinds of lusts, it is the handsome butcher with permanently bloody fingernails who offers her genuine love and hope. Once she has posed for Vermeer, alienating what few alliances she has, will the act enrich her, or destroy her? The latter seems most likely. There are no dead bodies here, no shootouts, and no car chases (or even coach chases), but there is plenty of conflict and drama. In the mold of Remains of the Day, class struggles and their inevitable dangerous role-playing keep the reader tense and involved. Personal destruction waits only a word, a movement, a slip-up away. As Vermeer in another painting gave us the town of Delft in near perfect brush strokes, Tracy Chevalier has given us a plausible and enchanting version of the girl with a pearl earring in near perfect keystrokes.
B000000ZGO|5.0|Let me just start off by saying I was 3yrs old when this \\"Album\\" came out.  And I remember that every one of my relatives had this album (including my mom and grandparents).  Everyone would be partying and playing this album.  (Ours is worn out....believe me).<br />You know how a song can trigger a memory?  Well, I saw movie \\"Dead Presidents\\" (great soundtrack CD), and Issac's \\"Walk on By\\" is included in movie (where they count the money).  All of a sudden, I remembered this cut!  I heard it so many times in my childhood.  So I had to see if HOT BUTTERED SOUL was released on CD.<br />Thank god it is!  Honey, this is soul music at its finest.  Issac Hayes does not get the credit he deserves in music history.  Forget Dionne Warwick's version, Issac Hayes is the BEST version I've ever heard.  The horns, the violins, the melody, the man is BAD!  This has got to be the best musical introduction I have ever heard in my life!<br />Then you get to \\"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedelamystic\\"...I have NO IDEA what the hell this means, but I feel the smoke, the sweat, the sex, the incense, the energy of this cut.  I tell you, they just don't make them like this anymore.<br />You want some soul, get HOT BUTTERED SOUL.  Issac may be \\"Chef\\" on SOUTH PARK now, but he's a musician always.  In heart and soul.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|If you have been a long time lover of Neil Young's music you should enjoy his new cd. By now long time fans of Neil know to expect the unexpected. If you are just a fan of his hits you will probably hate Greendale. I recently witnessed Greendale live and was completely blown away by the performance and story.<BR> However many &quot;fans&quot; seated near me were griping and booing because Neil wasn't playing his classics. The live Greendale is a very beautiful and moving story. I am not sure how people who have not seen it performed live will take to it. It's a concept album with themes of anti-violence, distrust of goverment, and love of the enviroment. If you're a true &quot;rustie&quot;, put on the cd and enjoy!!
B00005JLSE|5.0|It seems only fitting that in these bleak times, the musical would once again rise to popularity, and take Hollywood's most coveted award.  Musicals had their golden age in the 20's and 30's, in times of moral depravity, alcoholism, economic hardship, and less-than-stellar presidents.  Sound familiar?  Musicals were meant to take the audience to another world, a world of glitz and glamour, but more importantly happiness, romance, and hope.<br />This time around, it's a little different.  Gone is the naivete that was once so abundant in musicals, having been replaced with morally bankrupt characters who care only about themselves and their freedom, fame, and fortune.  The only exception here is Amos Hart, the only decent man to be found in the whole thing.  I wish I could say things work out for him, but, who am I kidding?<br />For the world of Chicago, unlike so many musicals, is not the place where the glitz, glamour, and music take place.  No, the world of Chicago is the world of the selfish, flash-in-the-pan stardom of the real Chicago in the 1920's.  Only the opening number, &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, and the final number, &quot;Nowadays&quot;, take place in the real world - all the glitz and glamour in between is in Roxie's deluded head.  And, in many ways, this Chicago is very realistic.  There were really such things as &quot;Jazz Killers&quot;, women who shot their husbands for various reasons; mainly to get on the front page.<br />So why five stars?  One reviewer gave one star for precisely the reasons I listed above.  Yes, these are reprehensible people (with the exception of Amos), so why watch?  To name but a few reasons, this is an entertaining movie with fantastic singing (Bob Fosse was a genius), stellar choreography and directing, and some of the best acting of the last year - (Catherine Zeta-Jones deserved it, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman and Richard Gere were robbed (at least the former was nominated.)).  But besides all that, a friend of mine put it best when she said: &quot;it's like a train wreck - it's disgusting and disturbing, but you just can't look away.&quot;<br />Chicago indeed has that quality, and against our better judgement, we can't help but like the characters.  It is a great musical, and even those who for one reason or another may steer clear of this genre should give it a chance - it's not your typical musical.  Instead of whisking us off to a magical land where everything turns out alright, it whisks us back to the Roaring Twenties, where, as my same friend put it: &quot;you just had to keep dancing and drinking, because if you stopped, you just might realize how bad things really were.&quot;
B00005OAIE|5.0|Well i'm a huge fan of John Mayer, and it's because of this cd.  John's voice is so soothing and he's a genius on his guitar.  Some songs are played on the acoustic and others are played on the electric. The lyrics are great too, absolutely no cliches!  The songs aren't poetic and sappy like other singer's songs but they definitely make sense, at least to me.  I would say this is a good cd for anyone, your best friend to your mom.  Nobody can truely dislike this music.
0930289234|5.0|I loved it. It gripped me and i just couldn't stop reading it. I was always suprised and the ending blew me away. Top!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I saw greendale live this year and I loved it!  It was alot different than all the other stuff neil put out in his earlier days. some of it is a cross between blues and rock, also with lots of guitar solo.  This is one of his best albums and also an essential album. I would reccomend buying it.
B000002KB8|5.0|This is the best Black Sabbath album, with Vol. 4 right under it. This was before Black Sabbath got really prententious. Granted, there is some of that with the lyrics, but the music, while it is dark, has a lot of electric blues influences. Every song is great, my favorites being Behind The Wall Of Sleep and The Wizard. Warning is another gem, which showcases Tony Iommi's great guitar playing. One of the best albums of all time, and certainly a kepper if you're into metal of any kind. Fans of this will probably like Sleep's Holy Mountain and Blue Cheer's Vincebus Eruptum.
B0000AI44Q|3.0|I've been a serious Neil fan for about 15 years now...buying everything the moment it comes out.<BR>Last night I waited in Union Square in New York City to get Greendale and the reissues at midnight, then I snatched up my copies & went home, First listening to \\"On the Beach,\\" and next to Greendale. Having been familiar with both, as a result of vinyl & the recent tour...nothing really came as a surprise. One interesting thing is how Neil Young's material changes when looked at as a body of work, in context with the albums around it.<BR>This is why Greendale is a good, perhaps great, album. Given the unfortunate \\"Are you Passionate?\\" from last year, this new outing brings some wonderful tunes along with it. However, there are a few things to be aware of: This is NOT Crazy Horse. Poncho does not play a note on the record & it sounds that way. This record is lot more quiet than most NY & CH Records. I'm really starting to appreciate, with each new release, the \\"Broken Arrow\\" record more & more. \\"Arrow\\" may be the last true Crazy Horse album we ever get to hear & should cherish it.<BR>OK, Greendale. If you saw the tour, you know the story. The album fills the whole disc, at 78 minutes, and has no real killer songs (excepts, maybe, \\"Be the Rain\\" which will no doubt be a new theme at Neil shows). The songs go on for a bit, which allows the remaining members of the Horse to do their thing with their rumbling rhythms so Neil can stretch out a bit (which he does, quietly). That's the thing about this album, it's quiet. The vocals are mixed differently than most of Neil's other records & it sounds like he was trying to get a \\"I'm losing m voice\\" vocal style. This effect works nicely in the sense that the album is an intimate one, recalling \\"Silver & Gold\\" more than \\"Passionate.\\" For that alone I'm greatful. The story moves along well & overall this is a really good bunch of tunes.<BR>Unfortunately, since Reprise decided to release the album alongside the reissues (after a long, long, long wait) along with classics like \\"On the Beach\\" & \\"Hawks & Doves\\" the new album pales in comparrison. Even though this album is among the best of his recent decade of work, it cannot hold a candle to the Neil of old.<BR>One great addition, which makes buying the new cd worth it, is the full DVD concert from Neil's solo Europe tour. After having seen Greendale twice with the horse, hearing the new album, and seeing excerpts of the movie online, this solo concert provides a peaceful rendition of the songs from the Greendale story. It is perhaps the best way to see & hear the new material; Just Neil, onstage with a slew of acoustic guitars, telling stories & singing his songs just like he was doing when he wrote \\"Ambulance Blues\\" & sang it for friends. Hopefully this sets a precedent for artists to release decent \\"Bonus\\" DVDs instead of one or two song piece of ... commercials.<BR>Still, only 3 stars for the Neil this time around. Let's hope the Horse has one more hard album in 'em.
B000002KHH|3.0|One thing I love about the 1st Black Sabbath album was the fact that it sounds nothing like what they did later on in their career. If anything, it sounded like distorted blues with a few songs having dissonant riffs. Paranoid starts the 'classic' phase of Black Sabbath, and while every song on this is good, there are a few things that bother me.<br />1)Whoever did the remastering needs to be slapped in the face. The album really needs to be turned up in order to hear it, and the drums are so...distant. It's annoying. The production is almost as bad as Metallica's And Justice For All.<br />2)Since this is the popular album, I guess I have to talk about Iron Man. I am fine with this song, but it seems that you can't talk about Black Sabbath seriously without some punk middle schooler with a backwards cap and a Limp Bizkit shirt saying &quot;Iron Man! Ozzy rules!&quot; So, that pisses me off.<br />All problems aside, this isn't a bad album. The lyrics are better than any of the pretensious lyrics off the 1st album. Some songs are about Vietnam, heroin, and hoodlums. Some are just as dumb as the 1st album. However, there is a little more variety. Planet Caravan is a nice acoustic trippy song, and Rat Salad shows off the awesome drumming of Bill Ward. <br />If you want to start your Black Sabbath collection, than be my guest, get Paranoid. Just don't say it's their best.
B00003TL18|3.0|While the CD is OK, you CANNOT appreciate this performance on this media. GET THE VHS OR DVD AND FIND OUT WHAT THIS THING IS REALLY ALL ABOUT !!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Initally I was somewhat unimpressed with this soundtrack but the longer I listen the more I like it.<br />The percussion in it is particularly good!  Also the CD is loud, I have bought CDs in the past that require the volume be maxed out to hear it.<br />The movie of course should get 10 stars.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride has got to have one of the best and most powerful voices in country music today.  She sings with all her heart, and it shows.  I am a huge fan of Martina and I believe that this CD really shines.<br />If I had to pick five of my favorite songs on this album, I would choose: \\"Valentine\\", \\"I Love You\\", \\"There You Are\\", \\"Where Would You Be\\", and \\"Concrete Angel\\".  Each one of these songs is truly outstanding and deserves to be listened to.  \\"Valentine\\" is a slow ballad with pianist Jim Brickman, very well done and beautiful.  \\"I Love You\\" is a peppy song about true love... very catchy and downright funny at times.  \\"There You Are\\" could well be my favorite song on the entire CD.  Very well written, and there is a part towards the end where Martina carries out one note for something like twenty-five seconds at full force.  It's just amazing to listen to and gives me chills every time.  \\"Where Would You Be\\" is an honest and thoughtful song, again, with truly fantastic vocals that blow me away.  And \\"Concrete Angel\\" is a touching tear-jerker about child abuse that everyone should listen to and think about.  <br />Every song on this CD is exceptional.  If you are a fan of well done country music with vocals that will blow you away, then you will not waste your money on this album.  I highly recommend it to you.  Enjoy!
B00009P1O0|5.0|Of all four &quot;missing&quot; Neil Young CDs, this is probably the most anticipated for first-ever release.  With good reason.  It's amongst his finest efforts.  Lyrically powerful and melodically catchy -- without sounding crassly commercial -- most of us fans wondered when the CD would ever arrive and what it'd sound  like.  It has the same impact on me that the initial release of the LP did all those years ago. &quot;Walk On&quot; and &quot;See The Sky About To Rain&quot; alone are worth the price.  Speaking of which, thanks to Mr. Young for making this a reduced price CD instead of full retail.
B00009UW0N|3.0|\\"Halloween\\" the film speaks for itself, and even 25 years later it still a supremely scary movie. This 25th anniversary release, however, wasn't all that I anticipated.<br />I was excited at the idea of the \\"long lost\\" director's commentary, but it turned out to be long-winded and dull at times. Carpenter, Hill & Curtis all repeat endlessly that the film is not meant to be a morality play, where the [physically] active girls (Lynda & Annie) are killed and the virgin (Laurie) survives; they were just killed because \\"they weren't paying attention, they were fooling around with their boyfriends.\\" Isn't that pretty much the same thing? In any case: we get it. Thanks for sharing. Can we move on to something different?<br />The director's commentary repeated a lot of sound bites from the documentary \\"Halloween: A Cut Above the Rest,\\" which I'd watched first, so that made it seem even more repetitive.<br />I agree with other reviewers that the special edition footage should have been included somewhere in this package, whether spliced into the movie or in a separate \\"deleted scenes\\" feature. This lack of a significant piece of the film's history was another disappointment.<br />The documentary, however, was well done, as was a 10 minute piece \\"On Location 25 Years Later\\" with Debra Hill and P.J. Soles. Overall, this is a version of \\"Halloween\\" well worth having for fans of the movie.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil Young, for my money, is always at his finest when playing with Crazy Horse.  The raw, uneveness of the performances makes for the most primal rock, the antithesis of studio-perfect sonics where the producers drop pins in the background so we can hear every tinnee sound.  Mr. Young has been touring behind this new &quot;concept&quot; CD for several months, gathering reviews that range from damning to high praise.  Many of the shows in Europe were solo.  But with the Horse, this is a fantastic display of musicianship.  With Mr. Young, what he says is never so important as how he says it.  Such is the case here.  The collective concept holds together throughout the CD, albeit gets a bit tiresome.  Taken individually, however, there are some of the most dynamic songs he's given us in years.  I'll says this: Neil Young is a genuine artist, as opposed to just being a superlative musician.  He follows his muse, commercial demands unconsidered.  And for those of us who take our rock 'n' roll best when on the edge, this is what music is all about.
0156027321|5.0|I'd rate this as a classic story.  First of all, the narrator has a juicy, irridescent curious and intelligent mind that enticed me to be just as curious as he was.  Secondly, the adventures he went through were explained in an order that enhanced the reading experience, only to make it more entertaining.  Thirdly, it promised to make me believe in God.  Since I'm a skeptic, I didn't htink it was possible.  Surely enough it wasn't - but it did give a very convincing argument why I should.  Why accept &quot;dry, yeastless factuality&quot; when you can revel in the better story?  This book about faith and natural beauty was very touching, and I think it'd be a pleasing experience for any reader.
B00009P1O5|4.0|I like my Neil Young served with an extra helping of Crazy Horse, and this CD has been worth the wait. Anyone looking to pinpoint the birth of grunge would do well to start with this 20+ year-old CD.  Sounded untaimed and savage upon initial release, and through the superb remastering it buries all those Pacific Northwest pretenders.  Ripping interplay between band members.  Uncompromising perspective.  All dished up with the best sound quality possible.  Now this is what I call great rock 'n' roll.  If only the songs were as tight as the band, this woulda been a classic 5-star CD.
B000069AUI|5.0|Not anything hardcore or anything but just great music to listen to.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple is my favorite solo singer. She is beyond talented. This girl can sing! She can write! And she can play the hell out of that piano!<BR>This is one of the best albums I've ever bought. I love it. I love every song. She pours everything into her music, and it's amazing.<BR>Just buy it. Even if you aren't a huge fan of hers, you just need to buy it. You won't regret it.
B00009W0U4|3.0|\\"Irreversible\\" is a very difficult film to watch. For starters, the jerky hand-held shooting of the first reel is a test of your stomach. It's as violent as it is dizzying. If you can survive this portion of the film, you'll be able to endure the rest. If you manage to do that, you'll witness a truly unique film experience.<br />Told in reverse chronological order, its similarity to \\"Memento\\" stops there. Here it works extremely well -- definitely more than a gimmick. It works so well in fact that if \\"Irreversible\\" were told in standard order, the film would be very unsatifying.<br />In addition to the opening, the film features a graphic rape scene that effectively shows its brutality.<br />Overall, \\"Irreversible\\" is a great film for someone that wants to see something that is really different. However, it is so harrowing and brutal, that you probably will not want to see it a second time. You've been warned.
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple is, without a doubt, the best solo singer I have ever heard. I admit, I didn't like her at first, but that was in 1997 when I was a naive third grader who only cared about the Spice Girls. I wasn't in touch with real music back then, but believe me, I am now.<BR>I actually bought her second CD first. I really loved the song \\"Criminal\\" and I wanted Tidal so bad, but when I went to the store it was out of my price range, so I bought When The Pawn... instead. That's what really introduced me to Fiona Apple. Every song on that album was perfect. Then someone I know burned Tidal for me, and I wasn't disappointed. <BR>Fiona Apple pours her heart and soul into her songwriting. It's honest, and beautiful. And most of all, it's powerful. She is, and always will be, one of the best singers on this planet. If you buy this album, you will not regret it. It's absolutely amazing.<br />Favorite tracks:<BR>\\"Sleep to Dream\\"<BR>\\"Sullen Girl\\" <BR>\\"Criminal\\"<BR>\\"Shadowboxer\\"<br />\\"Carrion\\"
0596000480|5.0|If you have some programming background, this book is pretty easy to follow. My web programming skill was only simple HTML. Then I had a big assignment dealing with HTML forms and a lot of JavaScript. I read this book and played around with it. JavaScript would be pretty easy if you know Java or C++.
B00008WT5C|4.0|Very good reissue and remastering, but where are the lyrics? I know,the original version did not have them, but it was something that could be added in this new version. Also, there's not a single photo of good old bassist Mark Evans... As for the songs, remastered or not, we all know them by now, and they're all fantastic.
B000002KIK|5.0|As Ozzy's last album with Black Sabbath, it is natural to think that this album (stinks) since (As some say) it was the final \\"kick-in-the-teeth\\" for the band's original line-up. Well, it doesn't, even if you know this Album and doesn't like it, you have to agree that this is not a typical Black Sabbath stuff, but a real album with it's band members trying really hard to make something \\"different\\" from which they were all famous for. Nevertheless, it was by making something different that Black Sabbath became famous at first place and who knows if this album would have been any better if they tried to copy the song's rythm and style from Paranoid or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath albums? All the songs in this title are 100% original and you may even put one of it's songs for your friends to listen and they won't believe you when you say it's Black Sabbath playing. Now, if you'll like the album varies from case to case, but here are some tips of rather or not you should buy it:<BR>1- It's true this is not the best first album to \\"go\\" if you still doesn't have anything from Sabbath. This album doesn't have any of the typical hard rock they're famous for.<BR>2- As previously said, the band's original line-up is gone here, so unless you're willing to hear Jazz like Rock or even to \\"addapt\\" to it, you won't like this CD.<BR>3- All of the songs contained in this album doesn't have any of the horror, drugs or critical like lyrics you hear on the other albums, instead, there are songs more \\"gentle\\" and calm, talking about the sadness of wars(or sort of) and grieff.(Maybe because Ozzy's father died before the album release?) There is one song, \\"Johnny Blade\\", which is a social critic, but is not the heaviest one on the subject.<br />If you still don't know if you want to buy the Album, there are songs on it which make the album worthile, independent of the rest: they are \\"Johnny Blade\\", \\"Juniors Eyes\\" and \\"Shock Wave\\".<BR>I personally gave this album 5 stars 'cause I think It's perfect as a last Black Sabbath album with Ozzy featuring it. All of the songs in it shows how Ozzy contributed to the band (and you ask me, his vocals are at it best on this album) singing with passion and will(Despite drugs and drinks problems). It's truth that Bill Ward sings on \\"Swinging The Chain\\" but it's still OK(I've heard worst). In general, a great album, though very few fans like it.
0385504209|4.0|Well written, real page turner, great plot,  I learned a lot  about church history .  Enjoyable.  However, the intricacies of all the puzzles were a bit much and sort of implausable. The characters educating each other during pretty stressful times just didn't ring true. Also, the story depends a lot on happennings that could have just as easily not happenned and sent the story off track.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Like anyone else who has heard this album before the only available format was vintage vinyl.  Some of the charm for On The Beach over the years was its raw production coupled with a lack of any high fidelity copies available. That has finally been rectified. This CD, and the other select tiles from the Missing Six, sound simply fanastic. Really putting to shame the sound on the other Young titles already out there. SACD would probably be the only way to top it. The sound is really just great.  The dobro on Ambulance Blues is just one example. <br />Aside from the nicely done remastering this album would be a necessary purchase solely for the classic music contained. I consider &quot;On The Beach&quot; and &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; both among Neil's ten finest songs ever written. &quot;Walk On&quot; is the more widely known 'hit' from this record and &quot;For the Turnstiles&quot; and &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; are both brilliant. The songs were recorded at a pivotal time in Young's career. Right after Tonights the Night while Young was still mired in his mid 70s fame hangover. On The Beach is significantly more polished than Tonight but not anywhere near the gloss of Harvest either. This is the perfect Young sound. Its how he sounds live and On The Beach captures him in an emotional state that can't be replicated on stage anymore.
B000003TA4|1.0|&quot;Nevermind&quot; pinches liberally from Killing Joke, a band with more than a superficial interest in the art of music, the song in question being &quot;Eighties&quot;.<br />Kurt Cobain spends the album doing what I can only presume to be 'guitar-tuning'; he desperately tries to play an original riff that goes beyond 4 chords but his massive lack of sophistication and musical talent prevents him from doing so.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT MOMENT OF MUSIC, DON'T LOSE TIME NO MORE, YOU GOT IT ! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DVD I HEARD IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. PRINCE IS A GREAT GUITARIST AND SHOWMAN. GREAT MUSICIANS ARE ON STAGE TOO, MACEO PARKER, LARRY GRAHAM, GEORGE CLINTON...YOU CAN BUY THIS DVD ONLY FOR THE KILLER PURPLE RAIN VERSION, BUT GOOD NEWS, YOU HAVE ALSO 22 OTHER TRACKS ON IT.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Ever since Ok computer and the ridiculous amount of praise and hype it got, Thom and crew beleive they don't have to try anymore. They write a few decent songs per album then fill the rest in with avante garde &quot;soundscapes&quot; and other awful mood peices. I doubt most people here ever really paid attention to electronic music such as Autechre, Massive attack or Krawftwerk before they heard Kid a. But as soon as Radiohead does it, its considered genius. Better run out and buy all those Aphex twin albums. Hail to the Thief isnt as electronic as thier previous 2 overated albums. Theres more of a Tom waits smokey piano ballads vibe to it. Theres also a few straight ahead rock songs here, 2+2=5, Go to sleep, There There, all of which are good. A Punchup at a wedding and A wolf at the door are the only other 2 tracks i would consider songs. The rest is for those who liked &quot;treefingers&quot; and &quot;pulk/pull revolving doors&quot;, not me.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an amazing album, and Norah Jones is a breathtaking artist.  If you like jazz/blues singing, you will love this.  Reminds me of Etta James in her ability to make me smile, but her voice is unlike anyone else's.  Those reviewers who slammed this album as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;lacking in emotion&quot; should seek out some Billy Idol or something -- &quot;I've Got to See You Again&quot; has all the emotion and depth you could hope for, and the bass and drums are beautiful.  Buy this album; you won't regret it.
0385508417|5.0|Although it's wierd to think of John Grisham beyond the lawyer book stereotype, this book about a couple who wishes to simply skip Christmas one year is just as entertaining as his other works.  Grisham takes us on a seemingly easy task of forgetting a holiday and taking a cruise and ends up with a hillarious scene involving rope and those lights that have a habit of getting tangled in themselves.

0385504209|5.0|This book will grab your interest from the first chapter.  Dan Brown is able to bring da Vinci's work to life in full-color and he adds history and conspiracies behind the works of art as well.  Although the book is at times cliched and transparent, the main plot will keep you hooked to discover as much as you can about the history of the Holy Grail and what (or who) it is.
0394800184|5.0|I know who my mother is, do you? The main character in this wonderful book, a really cute, small, baby bird, doesn't know who his mother is! I LOVE this book! It is sooooo cute when he asks the car if it is his mother! If you like Dr. Suess's books, you MUST get this one!
0312305060|5.0|This book is a searing depiction of three vastly different women, leading three different lives, but tied together ingeniously by the words in the novel Mrs. Dalloway.  Sometimes exposing the characters so much as appear defenseless, the book bravely shows the thoughts and decisions that each woman has made that has, unfortunately, led to their sad lives.  This novel does not sugar-coat life:  we all know that Virginia Wolff commits suicide and Cunningham alludes to this several times.  Only at the end do the pieces come together to reveal the entire picture.  Read this book, then go see the beautiful film.
0394800389|5.0|You MUST try reading this book out-loud, REALLY fast! It is almost impossible! I LOVE this book! My mom read it to me when I was a little girl! (Slowly of course) This book is full of wonderful tongue twisters!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|His recent tour Young played all his new 'Greendale'songs.The audience was suprised in a positive way.The album out now, Young plays with Crazy Horse (without Sampedro)and will suprise his fans again. He sings and plays inspired and it has a relaxed spirit.<BR>The album is about the Green family living in the fictional town Greendale. The songs are linked to eachother and is like a comedy book. Young shows on \\"Double E\\" his R&B influence which he had earlier in his career. That's perhaps the best conclusion of this album: Young puts all his influences in this album. The DVD which matches the album is realy outstanding and joyfull. Thanks to Greendale Neil Young is back where he belongs: at the top.
B000002JST|5.0|i have to agree with some of the reviews that this is the best ac/dc album ever. from start to finish this is classic blues rock. even though many people have back in black as the no. 1 album, this should be any real fans favorite. if an alien landed on earth and wanted to know what ac/dc was, you would have to put on a bon scott record, specifically, this one.
038572179X|1.0|I selected this book because of the rave reviews and numerous awards it received.  HOW??????  I could NOT get through it.  Too many words to describe too little of anything.   I will never pick up another Ian McEwan novel.
B00006IU73|5.0|This cd truely is amazing, and comes from a perennially underrated and thus undersold band.  Finally getting some major label love, Porcupine tree has progressed once again without becoming confined to the expected boundaries of a major label.  In absentia is perhaps even more abstract than their last two proper releases, stupid dream and lightbulb sun(both are currently deleted pending re-release early 2004).  This is one of the only original bands left, the only current band I can think of without comparing directly to another band, yet still blending influences and sounds to create something completely new.  I once said that this is what tool would sound like acoustic, but upon further listens, that doesn't do Steven Wilson and company justice. <br />track by track<BR>Blackest Eyes - replacing Even Less on tour as the opener, this song is a perfect mood setter that shows both the light and heavy ends of this full spectrum cd.  High ranking on my list of best porcupine tree songs..but so are most of these tracks.<br />Trains - I think this might have been placed somewhat poorly, it is overshadowed by the tracks before and after it.  Still a gem.<br />Lips of Ashes - competes with the very last song on the cd for my favorite of the album, the Brian Wilson esque harmonies near the end of this track are amazing.<br />Sound of Muzak - probably as accessable as this band gets, this is a great song with some more great vocal harmonies.<br />Gravity Eyelids - this song is probably the least accessable on the cd, very drawn out and ambient in nature. A good song, but it will probably take the casual listener, if there is such a thing, a few listens to get it.<br />Wedding Nails - a suprising centerpiece, instrumental, but a good song.<br />Prodigal - another very accessable song..it reminds me of coldplay<br />.3 - originally part of another song on the cd, it stands alone as a great transition from prodigal to...<br />the creator has a mastertape - A nightmare piece, andmore than likely my least favorite song on the cd.  The bass line comes of to me as cheesy.  I understand that another mellow song here would have probably made the album swing too far in that direction, but I don't know that this belongs on the cd, it kind of takes away from the pacing.<br />Heart attack in a lay by - The eye of the storm, this song stands out in between the heaver songs surrounding it.<br />Strip the soul - heavy, but good..this song touches tool.  A poor song to pick for a single..but thats a record label for ya. Really nothing else is like this on the cd, but lets hope they dont fall into sugar ray syndrome.<br />Collapse the Light into earth - beautiful song!!  Such a great closer, leaves you wanting more. <br />Here's to looking forward to the future for this band, which after 10 years still remains up and coming.  <br />If you like this cd, you would do best to work your way from here backwards in their catalog.  This band never stands still, and it suits them well.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I've watched it on TV, HBO, Showtime etc., over and over again, and then I bought the DVD.  I love it so much, as it is very, very scary.  Brought up with older sci-fi movies like &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, and &quot;The Thing&quot;, I found this to be engrossing, an 'edge of your seat' flick and SCARY!  The writer/producer made it simple and well thought out...I only buy movies that I truly appreciate and WANT to keep.  Otherwise, I just wait for them to show up to rent.
B000002BSG|5.0|For some reason this sets &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; became a huge<BR>international pop hit,had it's own MTV video and pumped up album<BR>sales but it isn't even the albums best song!THOSE would be the<BR>discofied &quot;Comsic Girl&quot;,the laid-bakc pop of &quot;Alright&quot; and the<BR>funky &quot;High Times&quot;,&quot;You Are My Love&quot; and the tital track.And then<BR>there are genuinely lovely ballads in &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Spend A<BR>Lifetime&quot;.Elsewhere this may be something of a retread but it<BR>does make it possible for more people to enter the magical,funky<BR>world of Jamiroquai.A great first purchase CD!
B00005JM02|5.0|The story, characters, and animation are all first-rate.  Especially good is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory.  Dory was so funny, but I was also touched during the scene where she is pleading with Marlin not to leave her behind because she did not want to forget him and their friendship. <br />As an earlier reviewer said, you must see Finding Nemo on the big screen first to experience Pixar's achievement in creating such a beautiful underwater world.  And be sure to stick around through the closing credits to see most of the characters swimming by--including an appearance by a character from a previous Pixar film!<br />See Finding Nemo before it leaves the theaters.  Then buy the DVD!.
B00000295A|5.0|Okay-let me start by saying that Jamiroquai have NEVER made<BR>a bad album but on their debut,Jay K and the band give the listener a jounrey through where funk came from in the jazz rock<BR>stew of &quot;Music Of The Mind&quot;,&quot;Revolution 93&quot; and &quot;Hooked Up&quot;.Not<BR>to mention classic funk such as &quot;When You Gonna Learn&quot;,the<BR>dance-funk of the tital track,the Headhunters-like &quot;Whatever It Is,I Just Can't Stop&quot;,etc.Love Earth,Wind &amp; Fire?Stevie <BR>Wonder?ANY classic funk at all?Start here and don't stop!
B00005JMCR|4.0|I must say that while I am very satisfied with how they ended this series, I am a little sad to see Jim (Jason Biggs), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), and the gang leaving. Unlike most teen movies, the American Pie series actually gets you to care for the characters.  I feel a slight connection to these characters. For example, I want to see Michelle again. The character, who has grown from a mere punch line into a frontman, is hilarious not to mention beautiful. When I heard that Alyson Hannigan was getting married in real life, I was a little sad (darn you Alexis Denisof), but it's not like I have a chance or anything. Also, Jim and Michelle are, in this way only, like my parents: my mom is Irish Roman-Catholic while my father is Jewish. Anyway, the movie follows the continuing exploits of Jim and Michelle before their wedding. They want the wedding to be perfect so they naturally choose NOT to invite Stifler (Seann William Scott), but he eventually is able to wrangle himself into the ceremony. Like Michelle, Stifler has grown in importance. In the first movie, he was a supporting character; he wasn't part of the group or the pact. In the second movie, the gang didn't want him at the beach house, but they needed him. In this one, they don't want him at the wedding, but he actually is the unofficial star of the movie. He and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are both vying for Michelle's hot (but nowhere near as beautiful as Alyson) Cadence (January Jones) and they actually switch personalities; Stifler becomes cultured and polite (only in front of the Flaherty family) while Finch becomes the rude \\"Finchmeister\\". Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) doesn't have much to do besides add a little support to Jim. The film could have been done without him. I'm not saying that it should have been done without him, I'm just saying that it could have. I wanted the entire gang back, but I'll elaborate later. Meanwhile, Jim is trying hard to impress Michelle's parents while Michelle struggles towrite her vows. As usual, laughs are inevitable while the characters struggle to achieve their separate goals: there is Stifler with the bachelor party, Jim and his nervousness, Michelle's dirty nature, and Finch's strange knowledge. If you liked the first two movies, you owe it to yourself to see \\"The Thrilling Climax\\". However, not everyone in the group decided to be a part of that climax. The one that I'm most surprised about is Oz (Chris Klein). He was part of the main group, something that Stifler was not. He was one of Jim's best friends and he wasn't even mentioned throughout the film. Also, he is a good counter-balance to Stifler: they are both popular jocks, but Oz is sensitive while Stifler is crass. Now if you have Oz, you have to have Heather. After all, the two are in love. If Heather was cut first, I can see why Oz wasn't there, but I don't understand why anyone was cut. Next is Vicky and Jessica. They are a pair, and while Vicky wouldn't have too much to do, Jessica (who would have Vicky with her for the ride) would be able to give advice to Jim and Michelle. Finally, there is Nadia, the only member of the lost gang who was even mentioned. I can understand why she was cut the most, however, she could have created some conflict for the two lovebirds. Before I wrap up this review, I must say this: be warned: there is a scene in this movie so disgusting that I almost threw up in the theater. I have never in my life come that close to barfing due to a movie in my life. So in conclusion,... It's like Michelle says in American Pie 2; you can't be too uptight. It causes problems. Enjoy this last piece of pie.
B000002LIX|5.0|This is one of the Classic alt-rock albums of all time. <BR>I see that a previous reviewer referred to the '2nd side' of the album (beginning w/&quot;Three Days&quot;) as &quot;filler&quot;.<BR>I say no, it's JA's equivalent to the 2nd side of the Beatles &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. An amazing trip. &quot;Three Days&quot; is about more than a menage a trois. See the album cover.
B00000IN5G|4.0|This is a good CD. The song 'Children of Bodom' is very good, and the guitarist is great, too bad he left, he had a lot of talent, hopefully we can hear him somewhere else.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|What can I say? This guy (Neil Young) is incredible. For somebody his age and of his accomplishments to come up with something so fresh, original, and at the same time, entertaining, is amazing. I just heard the CD in its entirety at a friend's house. Also, I saw Neil in concert in St Louis on August 10, where he performed the whole CD live. The show was fantastic! Neil has stayed true to his ideological roots while at the same time making them relevant to the year 2003. A great concept album which doesn't just have great concepts, but great music, too.
B00005JKCH|5.0|For all of the comic book super hero movies being made recently, Spider-Man is definately the best.  The acting, special effects, and plot line are all superb.  Everytime I watch it (which is quite often), I still find myself in awe about the whole experience.<br />Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Willem Dafoe were brilliantly cast in the three pivotal roles.  Each one exemplified the parts brilliantly while not being overly done.  After all, it is only a comic book fantasy.  Mr. Maguire perfectly captured the role of a high-school outsider pining for the affections of a girl who seems to be out of bounds.  And is an absolute delight to behold as he screams with glee at his new found abilities.<br />The writers captured the story of Spidey to a t.  Spider-Man has such heart and soul that any person could see themselves in the shoes of Peter Parker.  After all, who among us has never dreamed of being something more, wished they had asked that girl out, or fantasized about doing the daring dos that our friendly neighborhood web-slinger can do?<br />With the coming sequels on the way one can hope and expect that they will all live up to the original.
B000085RTX|5.0|Another band that satisfies my jones for hard driving, melody centered music, with progressive creativities.   I admit, I am pathologically addicted to Symphony X, and now to Kamelot as well.  <br />Karma is all over the place, slow, fast, driving, pounding, epic sounding in some places.  They are like the other bands I love, not ego driven, little gratuitous guitar thrashing, little bombastic showmanship that doesn't fit in the context of their overall music.   Everything fits, they display teamwork, and there is no thrashing (thank heavens).   <br />They never fall into the trap that so many guitar driven bands fall into (Rhapsody, or Malmsteen as an example), where guitar noise takes over and the melody and the message of the song gets lost in noise and pounding distorted technical playing.   These guys just love music and it shows.  Lots of interesting instruments, and different vocal interludes.   And Khan simply cranks.   King Khan is awesome!!<br />I love these guys.  Karma is awesome,
6305718954|2.0|What exactly is 'Stigmata' trying to be?  Is it a horror/thriller?  Is it a scathing commentary against the Catholic Church?  I really couldn't tell.  While the story is flimsily entertaining, and the effects creative and almost overwhelming, the film and its message can barely hold itself together.  The acting is sufficient, so I have to blame the screenplay.  <br />The basic premise is: a young woman - - who happens to be an atheist - - is stricken with stigmata (a condition where the wounds of Christ's crucifixion appear on a body) after receiving a religious item from a priest who has recently died.  The handsome, hip, priest who is assigned to investigate her case is then caught in the midst of Vatican politics fueled by Church self-preservationists.  The woman, meanwhile, goes through a very \\"Exorcist\\"-like transformation.  There are some very dumbed-down plot points that you have to just swallow in order to stay with the story.  Does anyone today really not have any idea what a rosary is?  Especially anyone who lived through the late '80s - - and is familiar with Madonna, Cher, or any other of the myriad of celebrities who have rosaries tattoed to their bodies?  Does a priest, particularly a priest who is stationed out of the Vatican itself, really need to be explained about the variety of Gospels, where they came from, and why they vary?  Would a hospital really release a patient whom they believed just jammed a pointed object cleanly through both wrists?  Wouldn't they put you on suicide watch or something?  Especially after you keep coming back with other mysterious wounds and no logical explanation for them?  And the biggest farce of them all - - how does a hairdresser get medical insurance where her doctor immediately wants to implant neuro-sensors into her head to investigate the cause of her seizure-like problem?  I have a government job and I have to get an ungodly number of authorizations and referrals just to have a mole removed!<br />The best partof this movie is seeing Enrico Colantino, the guy who played Elliot the photographer from the tv series 'Just Shoot Me', in character as a Vatican toady with a thick Italian accent.  <br />The problem with 'Stigmata' is most of the characters are utterly under-developed, as is the primary plot line, and the focus is placed on the special effects, including some not-so-dazzling attempts at utilizing symbolism.  I would have appreciated a more educated approach to learning about the so-called hidden gospel, and the attempts to get the Church to release the contents, with a little less possession sensationalism.
B000085RTZ|5.0|Do yourself the favor, spend time with this recording.   Most people reading any of our reviews of these bands are here for a reason - We all love this kind of music.<br />I no longer know if bands like Kamelot, Symphony X, Vanden Plas are power metal.  Or is it music written and performed by progressive thinking musicians who happen to play electric instruments.<br />Epica takes up where Karma left off stylistically, with some pounding numbers, some laid back pieces, and Khans soaring vocal chords ripping right through you.  This is a roller coaster of melodies, tempos, and themes.<br />Like most fans of music like this, I crave logenvity with these bands, and fortunately, Kamlelot is kind of just starting out, and Thomas Youngblood is obsessed with making music with this band, so I hope there is music making from these guys for as long as my ears work.   <br />Long live Kamlelot.
0440237688|5.0|This is absolutely, without a doubt the BEST book I have ever read. And though I may be young, I have read quite a few books, some truly atrocious ones, to tell the truth. Fortunately, for whoever is interested in knowing about this book's integrity or quality The Giver does not fit in the above category at all. I first read this book at the age of ten and I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I was one of the deluted people who tried to have it banned from class, mostly because of one particularly descriptive and unsavory passage that was far too advanced for me at that age. But ever since then, something about that book has haunted me until last year, when I picked up a copy at a used book store. It was only a matter of hours before I finished the book for the second time and felt the greatest sense of accomplishment at having finally grasped the story's universally appealing message. Let me just tell you this, if you read one book in the remainder of this summer, make sure it's this one. And definitely recommend it to your friends and be sure to have your children read it. In conclusion, this is a fantastic book that will continue to influence your opinion of all books prior to and following your reading of it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Take a look at your music collection. Are you the owner of 2 or more Led Zeppelin albums? Then do yourself a favor my friend and grab their new live DVD. It's a gift from the gods...or should I say &quot;the hammer of the gods&quot;. For those of us who never had the chance to see them in person, this package is as good as it gets. Plant, with his shriek-of-nature vocals, and the atomic wallop of his bandmates are all captured here in a series of jaw-dropping performances that really provide a key element that had been missing from the Zep canon.<BR>I haven't heard &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; yet, but I think that this is a better value: visuals, a sampling of songs from EVERY Led Zep album, and a wide variety of concerts from different places and times. The sheer quantity and quality certainly blows away &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; as a document of their on-stage prowess!
6305784116|5.0|This is the perfect first Disney movie for children, as well as cat lovers of all ages!  My daughter loved the movie when it was first made, and now my three-year-old granddaughter adores it.  The story is simple, sweet and amusing; the songs are cute and easy for children to remember.  I appreciate that the movie has no scary scenes, and the &quot;bad guy&quot; Edgar is more a bumbling figure than a menacing one.  The cats - Duchess, her three kittens, Thomas, and the Scat Cats - are all lovable and memorable.  Get this movie for your kids - Everybody Loves a Cat!!
B00008YLV2|4.0|[This review speaks mainly to the film, not the 3-disc special edition release]<br />Black Hawk Down is a tough movie to qualify.  It's visually amazing--this is some of the best combat I've seen in a movie.  It's thrilling, it's realistic, it's exciting.  I wouldn't exactly call this an anti-war film because it depicts war as the ultimate thrill, a real game of real bullets and blood.  Yes, it's hell, but with Ridley Scott directing it looks like a very, very good video game.<br />I don't know why this movie was made.  There is no political leaning, there is very little context.  It's a blow by blow account of what happened when over 100 Army Ranger and Delta Force soldiers were stuck in a hostile part of Mogadishu, Somalia in late 1993.  The enemy, as to be expected from a Jerry Bruckheimer film, is given no identity.  They are throngs of Africans, many of them kids, firing round after round and coming like swarms of bees even as they get cut down by the superior US firepower.<br />The problem is that the movie goes to very impressive lengths to play out this story.  The production is huge--the battle scenes, the city scenes (filmed in some bombed-out-looking part of Morocco apparently), the gunplay, etc.  This is an expensive film, and I have to wonder why the money and resources go into something like this if there is nothing to say.  Then it becomes pure entertainment, which is all the film turns out to be.  That's fine, but again, once in a while it would be nice to inject some intelligence into a project that obviously commanded so many other resources and considerations.<br />Why was America in Somalia?  Granted, that is not the concern of the film, but some kind of context for the war, the rebels, the aims of the mission, the pov of Somalis who were killing to negotiate, as one Somali says in the only behind-the-scenes bit in the film, would have put the film over the edge and actually made the audience ::gasp:: think about why America fights where it does.<br />There's also the obligatory war film clich&eacute;s that are just hard to stomach when we know that these are real soldiers being trivialized for the popcorn crowd.  Tom Sizemore, as a veteran and tough-as-nails McKnight, goes back into the fray to rescue more men and walks calmly through the street as bullets ricochet around him, like Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now.  Modern movie special effects can simulate rockets blowing people apart, literally, and leg wounds being operated on with someone's bare hands, muscle and sinew and all.  It is typical of Hollywood today: they have limitless resources, but those resources (being able to shoot a film as visually and technically impressive as this) serve a story that could use a bit more tweaking and humanization.  But the filmmakers are<br />not interested in that angle.<br />It would be nice to know why Mogadishu is hell on earth, with hordes of enemies tearing people out of helicopters and raining rockets on American soldiers.  Yes, the soldiers were brave, they were highly trained, but the mission was a disaster, and it does the real story a disservice to portray it as just another chapter in American gung ho-ism.  Also, the single most memorable bit of that real story was the body of an Army Ranger being dragged through the streets by an angry mob that spit on him, and much worse.  That was a disturbing bit of footage for Americans to watch.  Would that have been more tasteless than showing an RPG rocket stuck in someone's side?  Massive, gaping wounds?  Missing legs?  Why clean up real events and their aftermath for the sake of a night out at the movies?  Maybe they should put their mouths where the money is.<br />Make no mistake--I couldn't turn this film off.  It's exciting; it made me want to play Ghost Recon or one of those games.  It also made me want to find out more about this grim chapter in President Clinton's tenure as Commander in Chief, even though it was his predecessor who landed troops there when he was a lame duck.  Somalia was an embarrassment, an event that told America we were no longer willing to sacrifice men--18 as compared to over 1,000 Somalis killed in battle--in some foreign wasteland.  The film is not enlightening in that regard.  It's exciting, it's Jerry Bruckheimer, folks.  Watch it and decide for yourself.<br />It looks like they went to very impressive lengths to put this out on DVD, as expected with a production like this.  Definitely worthwhile to pick up, as multiple commentaries, deleted scenes, and other goodies sweeten the deal.as a lame duck.

B0000AI44Q|5.0|Truly a fantastic album, and by far one of my favorite Neil Young recordings of all time.  Having seen him perform \\"Greendale\\" a few weeks ago on tour with Crazy Horse, I knew this album was going to be special (even though it seemed many fans at the concert would rather have heard him play \\"Heart of Gold\\" than new material, which just boggles my mind).  As you probably know, Greendale is a \\"musical novel,\\" telling the story of the Green family of Greendale, California, as certain events unfold in their lives.  <br />The music is pure Neil & Crazy Horse.  The highlights for me are \\"Bandit\\" and \\"Grandpa's Interview.\\"  There are no let-downs; all 10 songs are superb.  Neil's guitar playing, as always, is amazing and makes everyone else sound like an amateur.  After the disappointing \\"Are You Passionate?\\" this album more than makes up for it, and will be in my CD player for quite a long time to come.<br />The Bonus DVD is a live, solo acoustic set of Neil performing Greendale in Dublin earlier this year.  The greatest thing about Neil is that every song of his has two versions; and electric and acoustic, and both versions are always completely different and utterly excellent.  Here, you can listen to the electric Crazy Horse versions, then watch Neil go it alone with his acoustic guitar, harmonica, and pint of Guinness.  In an age of Justin Timberlake albums, stuff like this gives me hope for mankind.
B000000YNZ|5.0|This is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the Bill Evans trio. This was I'm told  Bill's first all ballads record. Riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962.  None of the music sounds dated. considering it's 41 years old. This is the first recording Bill made with Chuck Israels taking over for the late Scott Lafaro as the bass player. This album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it. The music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection. One goal that Bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and  original sounding jazz. I dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording. To me it sounds more like European classical music. Also thank god for Bill's college music theory teacher at Southeastern University Gretchen Magee.  Because if it werent for her motivation {Evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition \\"Very Early\\" {which is the last track on the CD its just breathtaking...}Being an amature pianist myself, \\"Very early\\" and \\"childrens play song\\" were the first two Evans' compositions I taught myself to play. The piece is a composition played in C major at a slow waltz tempo. He played the tune until the end of his life in 1980, but the original version on \\"moonbeams\\" might be the all around finest one.  It is given a very slow and delicate treatment, and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow  falling gently around you. I also really like his interpretation of \\"It might as well be spring\\". I think that Bill Evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that. He didnt play anything he didnt have to. He always played just the right amount of  notes and chords. With this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement. Evans once told Tony Bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on \\"truth and beauty.\\" With the album \\"moonbeams\\" fans of Evans' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album. Highly recommended!
B000099T2L|2.0|Against my own will, I have become a great admirer of Miss Knowles'. In fact, I am so much a fan, that I don't like the \\"Crazy in Love\\" video that much. They sacrified her personality to general sexual attractiveness. You can't see the difference between her and any go-go dancer picked up in a Las Vegas club. Not enough of her mysterious Charms there. <BR>I first saw her in \\"Goldmember\\", and she won me over with her grace, a rare quality in times of clumsy Britney Spearses.  I decided to award her a public sign of her victory on my wits: I could well risk to throw away some money for once, and buy her album. <BR>Well, er, I do feel this is not precisely what I'll listen the most the next few months. I felt rather happy for Miss Knowles when I heard \\"Crazy in Love\\" for the first time: I felt it was the best that could be expected at this time from her very \\"poppish\\" style. It featured \\"uncommon\\", spicy chords, plus nice drum lines... <BR>Unfortunately, the rest of the album is... different . It's the musical equivalent of the  \\"Crazy in love\\" video (minus the beat). She produced the cd herself, and you feel she tried to dabble with different influences (rock on \\"Hip Hop Star\\", \\"arab\\" on \\"Naughty Girl\\"), and try something a bit original. That's why there's a second star  up there. But it's all engineered to sound like \\"sexy whispering\\": good for selling to bachelors in need of some excitement. It's a pity you can't hear her voice's qualities: far from being extraordinary, it has sometimes a nice timbre in the \\"Broadway meets soul\\" kind, to quote another reviewer. It's so bad, that she sounds more convincing on \\"Beyonce's Interlude\\", where she just speaks. There you hear a remarkably \\"no frills\\"  diction, which rings truer (and is in part responsible for the endearing qualities of her singing, when she does it convincingly).<BR>There are also two additional (weird) problems: first, if she stops whispering, she tend to force her voice to registers that she can't sustainwithout strain, and heavy editing doesn't hide it. Secondly, the production on all other tracks is terribly inferior to the one in \\"Crazy in Love\\"; bass lines are poor, so are the drums and the riffs. The harmonies are far too monotonous. The \\"experimental\\" edges just sound messy. Only the Missy Elliott production, \\"Signs\\", is slightly better: the chorus appears even a bit ironically coquettish.<BR>Less whispering, less \\"sexy\\" breathing-gasping-panting, less \\"maaaking looahve\\"(Speechless)!  It's a cheap style and Miss Knowles isn't especially convicing in it. This ruins the album.  And it does no justice to Miss Knowles' qualities. She has shown on her single \\"Work it out\\" how  much better she can be; if she fixed some glitches in her singing (probably, \\"bad\\" breathing), she could really deliver performances I'd follow with pleasure. Here, they try to make her sound (and look, on the covers too) identical to countless glittering pop starlets,  sugary-sexy and anonymous.
6304779607|5.0|It is amazing how every review i have read hates this movie. I can't agree with them. This movie is a classic 80's action movie. This movie has it all: a cool cop with a slick car and awesome  fire power, a hot chick, and a pyscho killer with a big a** knife. This movie also has some of the best one liners, my favories:<br />&quot; Go ahead , i don't shop here&quot;<br />&quot; Your a disease, amd i am the cure&quot;<br />&quot; you know what your problem is...your too violent&quot;<br />&quot; this is where the law stops.. and i start&quot;<br />I could name all the classic lines in this but i don't want to spoil it. It also features Reno Santoni who was in the first &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. You either love this movie or hate it to death. I grew up with it and i have it proudly in my collection.It is on my list of the 10 best cop movies. Stallone's best cop movie since &quot;Nighthawks&quot;. This Cobra packs bite.
B000002UR7|3.0|Even with the bravely experimental Kid A and Amnesiac, Pablo Honey remains Radiohead's most controversial album and the cause of the majority of arguments about the band.  The essential detail to remember is that it's the start of an ever developing and maturing vocal talent by Thom Yorke and, if for that reason alone, it's a fascinating and curious listen. But for those of you that are wondering, the argument that arises over this album is a simple one:  is it an irreplaceable element of the genius that is the Radiohead musical canon, or a rather shoddy and overblown first attempt at success and recognition?<br />The truth can be found somwhere in between.<br />What will strike you first when you begin listening to Pablo Honey is how incredibly confident lead singer Thom Yorke sounds, almost to the point of being cocky.  These were the days when he actually wanted to be a famous rock star, remember, perhaps more that anything and, yes, these were the silly peroxide blond days.  A telltale sign of the bands' attitude towards their music is evident during the 1994 London Astoria concert (available on video), where Yorke amusingly introduces some of the Pablo Honey tracks as \\"oldies\\" and apologises for first appearances of soon-to-be greats \\"My Iron Lung\\" and \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\", moments that you can't help but smirk knowingly at.<br />At this stage in his and Radiohead's career, two of Yorke's musical inspirations were Elvis Costello and Scott Walker and, blimey, you can tell, but as a young aspiring singer will often do when emulating the vocals of his hero is eventually grow out of it.  Yorke ultimately did and became confident in developing his own sound, but on this, the debut Radiohead album, he is delivering to us his pet peeves, politics and posturing in a skewed homage to Costello and Walker's vocals yet delivered in a rather undernourished and puerile way that suggests a healthy amount of youthful arrogance.<br />The second thing that will strike youwhen listening to Pablo Honey is how energetic it is, full of mounting enthusiasm and churlish naivety that must be admired.  As with all Radiohead albums, one listen will not do it justice, as Yorke never writes lyrics that you can instantly hum along to, but one suspects that it is to early in the game to believe these songs are in any way profound.  The tracks will undoubtedly stick in the memory though, in particular \\"Thinking About You\\", \\"I Can't\\", \\"Lurgee\\" and the unfortunately titled \\"Vegetable\\", simply because they encapsulate that sound of withdrawn desperation and pitiful regret that their next albums would take to a greater level.  But Radiohead were yet to refine their sound, and as it is, Pablo Honey often presents itself as an obnoxious wall of noise: all crashing drums and slamming guitars with very little direction other than to be as loud as possible.  There's no sign of simple, bittersweet melodies here, the kind that would make \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"No Surprises\\" and \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" so important.  Some may enjoy this musical explosion, and as previously mentioned, there's a raw and exited energy on display that will eventually be focused into greater things, which is where the arguments start.  It's easy to call Pablo Honey a great album with the benefit of hindsight after seeing what Radiohead have achieved since, so taking into account the dramatic change in quality in the bands' albums, a question springs to mind: what went right?  Actually, that's a trick question, you really need to ask: what went wrong?  <br />Unless you fell into a nuclear bunker in 1993 and have only just managed to find your way out (which is what happened to me until I became a Radiohead admirer recently), you'll already know that the single from Pablo Honey, \\"Creep\\", which stormed the world and made their name in America also, ironically, almost destroyed them.  Due to the popularity of \\"Creep\\", the rest of their debut album was largely ignored, and Radiohead were instantly labelled \\"one hit wonders\\".  During this period they were forced to experience the often embarrassing, humiliating and tacky mainstream youth-rock promotional juggernaut quick and early.  Although at the time they must have felt cursed, in the long run it did them the world of good.  Firstly it took away that cocky enthusiasm and forced them to step back and ask themselves \\"so why are we one-hit-wonders\\"?  <br />The truth is Pablo Honey isn't that good, even if you buy it for the miserable-youth anthem \\"Creep\\", a song which, if listened to in a simple acoustic version (available later as a single b-side) can be found to be pretty worthy stuff, especially without those loud \\"cha-chung\\" noises.  When compared to most substandard rock industry outputs Pablo Honey could be hailed as a work of art, but as you would with a great painter or film director, it is difficult to measure Radiohead against another artists work, only against their own standards, and so their first album ultimately fails in that respect.<br />Nice try though.<br />If you have yet to listen to a single Radiohead album and are curious as to what all the fuss is about, by all means invest in Pablo Honey, as after you've become addicted to The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, Amnesiac, Hail To The Thief and all the surrounding b-sides, you'll find yourself stumbling back to their first ever album and trying to imagine what it was like back in 1993, hailing Creep as the song for your generation without knowing what was yet to come.
B00009RDG9|2.0|Summary:<BR>Aaron Hallam (Benicio Del Toro) is a U.S. military trained killer.  That's all fine and dandy until the killing becomes more than second-nature to him; it becomes his first nature and he can't seem to stop doing it, even when he isn't on assignment.  His urge to kill is so powerful that he ends up butchering some deer hunters.<br />The F.B.I. are called in and they turn to the man who happened to train Aaron, L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones), to catch him and/or stop him.  L.T. agrees and does find him but nearly dies in the process, only to be saved by the person in charge of the F.B.I. contingent on the case, Abby Durrell (Connie Nielsen (I)), who tranquilizes Aaron at the last possible moment before he kills L.T.<br />Aaron is then taking into custody only to escape and lead Aaron on a hunt through Portland and eventually back into the forest where L.T. finally catches up to him for their final showdown with knives.<br />My Comments:<BR>I had the conception that this movie was going to be something like a Rambo remake with a U.S. special forces operative going a little haywire and wanting to either be left alone or kill everyone.  Well, it is pretty similar except in this movie the Rambo character, Aaron, isn't really provoked and ends up dying at the hands of his trainer instead of giving up to his trainer.  So, the idea isn't really all that original.  There is, however, one element of the movie that is original which is why I gave it two stars instead of one, but I'll get to that in a minute.<br />As for the story, it's horrible.  There is an attempt to explain why Aaron went crazy - he saw too much violence in Kosovo and snapped.  But there is no attempt to explain how he ended up in the forest in Oregon nor is there any connection drawn between him being in the forest and him killing the hunters.  There is an attempt to humanize Aaron, by having him threaten to reveal top secret information and also having him meet up with a woman and her daughter,but both of these are quickly dismissed for what seems to be the primary focus of the movie - knife fights and L.T. tracking Aaron.  Dismissing the potentially interesting subplot of Erin wanting to expose the U.S. governments top secret assassination operations was the wrong thing to do, it gave Aaron a better motivation for the killings then just being psycho.  It also isn't really explained why L.T. never replied to Aaron's letters nor why he quit training killers in the military; a lot goes unexplained in this movie and it could have been much better.<br />As for the story we see in the movie, it just gets worse.  At least 1/2 of the movie is just L.T. tracking Aaron until they finally meet up for the 25 minute knife fight by a waterfall.  Along the way Aaron does some pretty silly things, like climbing a bridge tower instead of just diving off into the water or even getting on the subway in the first place.  Aaron also seems to lose L.T. about a million times only for L.T. to suddenly find him again without any explanation.  Then, of course, the F.B.I. has to choose not to listen to L.T. and spends most of the second half of the movie combing the river and river banks looking for Aaron only to somehow become informed of the final confrontation taking place and arrive just in time to watch it end.  How they became informed of the fight is beyond me.  <br />There are no plot twists, though I'm guessing that the truck accident was supposed to be one but anyone with half a brain could have seen that coming.  And, frankly, the movie is pretty boring.  What's more, when you watch the special features afterwards you realize that most knife fights last all of 20-30 seconds before one of the combatants is dead or dying.  For some reason the fights between  Aaron and L.T. last forever.  It was wholly implausible, but I guess a 20 second fight scene wouldn't be as fun to watch, thus the extended fight sequences.  The story, as a whole, is pretty bad.  Even the ending is kind of lame.<br />As for the acting, it wasn't too bad.  Both Benicio del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones are good, but they are the only ones worth mentioning.  I'm thinking that in the original script Abby Durell was supposed to have a bigger part, but for some reason she is really limited to just being L.T.'s sounding board when he isn't chasing or fighting Aaron.  As for the rest of the actors, they were pretty much knife fodder for Aaron and didn't need to be good, so they weren't.<br />The one original thing I felt the movie did was introduce the audience to a new form of knife fighting.  The fighting choreography was actually pretty interesting and fun to watch, though it did tend to get a bit carried away.  I gave the movie an extra star just for trying something new.<br />Overall, this is really just a slightly modified remake of Rambo with a different ending, and, sadly, that's about all.  If you've seen Rambo and liked it, you probably won't really want to see this because it might corrupt your vision of a great movie.  Of course, on the other hand, if you didn't like Rambo, you probably won't like this movie because it is pretty much a copy cat.  So, if you didn't see Rambo, you may want to give this one a try.  As I said, the knife fighting is pretty interesting and some of the special features that come on the DVD are good additions.  But as a story, I think the director, William Friedkin, probably ruined this by focusing so much on specific locations instead of telling a compelling and interesting story.  I don't recommend this movie (and I like special ops/action/war movies).

B00003CXAY|5.0|After viewing Naqoyqatsi at SA's NPR CinemaTuesday event, I had to watch the first of the Qatsi trilogy to help me understand why I never forgot the haunting vision.  Perhaps, I thought, being an idealistic second year Philosophy major made me believe something that wasn't really there: Life distilled into a shot of on-screen espresso.<br />No.  Twenty years later and the film is still relevant.  The wonderful cinematography and soundtrack combine in a synergistic dance that forces the viewer to contemplate their existence among the mighty forces of man and nature.<br />Powaqqatsi is no different.  The cinematography and soundtrack offer a stunning experience for the viewer to contemplate man's struggle with himself.<br />This DVD set should be a welcome addition for people who experienced Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi on the big screen. YMMV when you consider the experience in a movie theater vs. home theater.  For my experience, I had a 16 x 9 TV, and a very high-end sound system, a perfect pairing for recreating those feelings from 20 years ago.

B00009P1O0|5.0|This is Neil at the very top of his game. His personal life a mess, with a wake of heartbreak, loss and destruction floating up on the beach like the human shipwreck he was at that point, Young managed to craft his most disturbing music of his career during the period that began with EVERYBODY KNOWS thru RUST, with TONIGHT, BEACH and ZUMA being the incendiary crucible of his soul.<BR>On the heels of the bleak TONIGHT, OTB came as a disturbing re-assessment of whether the struggle was worth the cost. &quot;An ambulance can only go so fast.&quot; Indeed. Jimmy McCollough's book paints this period in Young's life as epochally bizarre, the recording involving Rusty Kershaw as something that was part Outer Limits, part Charles Barkowski, part Raymond Chandler, all laced with chemicals, liquids and the undertow of California that had just recently generated Charles Manson. Young's a long, long way from the kid in the schoolyard in Winnipeg of &quot;Don't Be Denied&quot;. Here he stands on the beach of a failed marriage, deaths of friends and employees, shattering of professional partnerships, observing the sky about to rain. Never in all of his works would he sound this haunted. His own ability to destroy loved ones casts a scared pallor in &quot;Vampire Blues&quot;. The epic &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot;, on the heels of a momentary breath of release of his cinema fantasy poem, creates a psychologically disturbing film worthy of Polanski, Hitchkock, Demme. <BR>The songs were coming at lightning speed for Young. The myths surrounding his public performances were growing taller, scarier, more intense with every word of his appearances. The truth was even more frightening. One can best understand this period in his life by seeing &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; at one end of the tunnel and &quot;Will to Love&quot; at the other, with &quot;Danger Bird&quot; charting the flight. But at the end of this CD, Young had painted a masterpiece. If you were to own only 1 CD of Young's, this is it. Mitchell had painted BLUE as a woman on the verge of a breakdown. Young broke down on the beach and sent us the postcard.<BR>One program note: I've enjoyed the Japanese bootleg of this disc for years because of its inclusion of live sets from this period: in concert, the disturbing quality of these songs was relentless. This is the reason Young has the reputation he has.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Ok, I'll say it again...My favorite movie ever.  I have heard that it is a remake, but I don't care.  No one else could have played his/her parts like Harrison, Julia and Greg (aka Linus, Sabrina and David).  All three were simply irresistible.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink FLoyd has always been a favorite artist of mine. The Wall is one of their greatest albums ever. Hello to all you pink floyd fans and to all you people who might get into pinks floyds music, Do it .. youll be glad you did!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|long, boring, and a plot that is very hard to understand. this movie kept dragging on and on. i just wanted it to end and when it does end we realize we have to sit through a whole new movie cause nothing really ends here. they just leave u hanging there. but this movie wasn't near as close to being as big as everyone expected
0790729628|3.0|I fully agree with reviewer Dan Wiley. Regardless of the pompous nature typical of &quot;director's cuts,&quot; the theater release version of Blade Runner is the better movie. Substantially better in my opinion. Harrison Ford's narration is delivered with the no B.S. approach of Mikey Spillane. It only adds to the film. I like it and so does everyone else with whom I've discussed this sci fi classic. If Mr. Wiley is correct and there will be a DVD re-release including the original version, that's the one I'll buy. Until then my aged VHS copy will soldier on...
B00008NRI7|3.0|\\"Two Weeks Notice\\" was a little disappointing.  I had expected a movie with two of my favorite actor/actress in it to have more sizzle, because I know they have it in them.  <br />Sandra Bullock is cute, as always, and Hugh Grant, always dashing.  but Two Weeks Notice admirably avoids the obvious. It was a little hard to catch on that his \\"partner\\" was his brother.   If you had not been paying close attention, you would/could have missed that factor.  A better job could have been done in the script.
B0000542D2|4.0|This movie, the first one where the Fab Four were captured for posterity, definitely has a historical character which sets the stage for things to come later. It's absolutely fair to grant it the title of precedent to the music video, in a conceptual way, in spite of the fact that the movie lacks what you would call a solid storyline. The \\"story\\" is basically depicting the four guys in their typical environment, jumping, laughing, joking, playing GREAT music (every song is brilliant!) and overall, having fun, while taking good care of each other, almost like brothers. In this, you have to give credit to Dick Lester, the director for accomplishing his initial vision of showing The Beatles \\"as they were\\", and not playing the 3 Musketeers or some other thing they weren't.<br />In my opinion, the interviews (last part of disc 1 and most of disc 2) complement VERY well the film footage. I strongly disagree with the reviewer that argues that the interviews were uninteresting and unnecessary. To the contrary, they supplement the viewer with an abundance of information about the context that surrounded the movie, the music and round it up as a more solid documentary of the band's overall picture at the time.<br />Worth seeing: absolutely. Worth buying: I'd argue it, but I guess die hard Beatles fans will want to own a copy of it.
B00003CXIY|5.0|funny stuff. this is a good movie with a funny story and it's just cool to watch but it seemed like it was trieing to be american pie too much. they even have sean william scott in it basically playing stiffler all over again. o well, its funny so why not. i'd say its one of the best for its genre
B00008PX8P|5.0|Words fail, superlatives are inadequate and high expectations for both longtime fans and the uninitiated are exceeded beyond imagination. Some things just can't be improved upon, no matter how you try. Sometimes, you just simply cannot accept substitutes, derivative or otherwise... This superb smorgasbord of video concert footage will satisfy anyone with even a passing knowledge of the greatest rock band to ever take a stage. There's a reason we're still listening to them 20-30 years on and will STILL be listening to them in another 100... but now we get to see it, too...and it does not disappoint. Highlights too numerous to mention: killer Royal Albert Hall jams, all the Earl's Court footage, the Ocean from Madison Square Garden, frenzied Knebworth crowd, Kashmir, great outtakes, it goes on and on...if Jimmy never gives us another DVD release, this one will suffice to seal their legend in granite.
B000002UKS|5.0|I have been a fan for over a year and they fast became my favourite band. I first bought One By One then at christmas bought There Is nothing Left To Lose, which are both graet albums. I instantly went into town to buy this album and loved it loads and can never stop listening to it and the songs never seem to get any worse, if anything they get much better every time you listen to them!
B00003CXB2|5.0|The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;  Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out.  Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon.  It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;  And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia.&quot; <br />The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them.  Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences.  &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; has these elements too, but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man.  Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.<br />&quot;Lawrence&quot; feels unlike other historical epics of its time.  In most &quot;big&quot; films--I'm thinking of movies like &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; &quot;Spartacus,&quot; &quot;Cleopatra,&quot; all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as &quot;Lawrence&quot;--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses.  One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction.  Everything feels static and wooden.  But in &quot;Lawrence,&quot; Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces.  In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed.  It's moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scene---that set &quot;Lawrence&quot; apart from other standard epics.<br />And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole.  He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable.  He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform.  He carries &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders.  That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great, but O'Toole towers above them all.  O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshipped or feared, or perhaps both.<br />Lean would never direct an equal to &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; again.  His later films are certainly more than watchable, and &quot;A Passage to India&quot; is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another &quot;Lawrence.&quot;  Even more reason to appreciate it now.<br />My Grade: A+
0385335482|2.0|Maybe I'm just out of touch with modern society. Maybe I'm too much in touch, and our heroine's credit problems strike too close to home. At any rate, I just could not get interested in this book, in Becky Bloomwood and her problems, or in any of the other characters in the story. Conspicuous consumption is not funny. Going hopelessly into debt so that you can buy more stuff you don't need is not funny.
0060090383|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  A serious subject, yet the author had a way of appropriately adding a humorous theme.  I think that anyone, with our without an addiction, can identify with some of the insecurities that Rachel experiences in this book.  I actually had some tears as I was reading this and was shocked at how I was affected.  This was my first Marian Keyes book and I will definitely look for another book by her....after I digest this one for a little while though.  :)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a huge fan of the show, has I have been of all of Joss's work. I was so angery when it was chanceled. I know I was not the only one. It was taken from us with out asking. The least fox can do is put it out on DVD so we can see the 3 unaired episodes and enjoy the wonder of Joss, the cast and crew's work. <BR>Bring back FireFly.
0743244249|1.0|I fail to see how the other reviewers of this book can praise it so effusively without breaking down into school-girl giggles.  Cosmopolis is not a novel, it is a form of torture.  The dialogue is unrealistic to the point of absurdity, filled with inane observations and non-sequiturs.  In fact, the entire book is so rife with irrelevancies that I'd swear a child with ADD wrote it.  My three year-old cousin can compose more coherent sentences than the ones which litter the pages of this atrocity.  I seriously wonder whether DeLillo actually thought about what to say in his passages, or if he merely rifled through the dictionary and chose words at random.  Be forewarned: buying this book supports literary terrorism.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|What else would you expect or want?  Neil in great form and making Crazy Horse keep up.  If you don't know (which you do) it touches on subjects to those of us that are perceptive can connect with and takes them to a new level.  This isn't a long review because reviews are typically silly.  You shouldn't need someone to expel feelings for you, much less some dingbat off amazon.com. I won't tell you to get this album because you either know you should (or have already) or you can contemplate whatever else is out there that might do something for you.  Highly likely is the case that whatever else you choose that is 'new' will fall miserably like a rock to the ground.  Know or don't know.
B000089RVX|4.0|I was really, really impressed with this album from the first time I heard it. And I'm picky about my music! Honestly at least half the tracks are very high quality and while I'd agree they're not really doing anything all that new (Queensryche powerchords meet Book Of Love lyrics and singing) they do justice to the genre, especially given how saturated it's become in recent years.<br />I'll take this space to make a little rant though about music production nowadays -- This CD is the epitome of poor post-production. You want to know why the producer should be shot? Put on track 2 (Bring Me To Life) on a good system and listen when the bass guitar comes in at the beginning. Synth-rumble notwithstanding, you've got a nice deep richness to the sound, then notice when the chorus kicks in -- It's the magical disappearing bass! <br />Overcompression and emphasis on high levels limits the dynamic range so much my boyfriend was saying, &quot;Good lord, it's all midrange!&quot; He's right, and it's why I don't give this a perfect rating for a debut effort. Great music badly recorded is just sad.
B00009RGBS|5.0|I'm reading the reviews of others and find that this movie is being compared to Moulin Rouge. I personally think that these two movies should not be compared in the least. They are very different, although BOTH are musicals, this is all they share.       Chicago has a great story, great acting, great singing (I agree with most critics - Catherine Zeta-Jones has a great singing voice and Renee isn't as good, but isn't that her character as well folks?) and great customes etc. They really razzle dazzle us with great music, great satyre (sp?) on the press and legal system of the day, which hasn't changed much and parallels today's court rooms.       Folks this is an awesome movie and for those of you who are concentrating on the lack of voice training on Ms. Zellwegers and Mr. Gere's part, let us consider the voices of Ms. Kidman and Mr. McGregor. Not great either of them, but good enough and still entertaining. That's what this is, not a world statement.

B00007FOMP|2.0|In 1971,Marvin Gaye released\\"What's Going On\\",an album of unprecedented ambition for soul music,which addressed real issues-poverty,the state of the nation,the economy-and did so with thick,complex arrangements and,of course,smooth,emotional,inspirational singing.It has since been described,often,as the greatest album of all time.It was nothing less than a new birth of soul,the cocoon from which would hatch a wonderful butterfly:a mature,album-based music which would last forever.<br />By,oh,1976 or so,soul music was in a bad way:within another five years,soul was creatively dead and commercially wounded,floundering in a quicksand of overcooked bedroom schlock.What had happened?Most critics and commentators blamed the rise of disco,a bastardised kind of black music,production-line funk which had attracted multiracial and polysexual dancers to clubs where they could dance and have fun.They didn't ask why disco had become NECESSARY in the first place,didn't ask why people were buying these repetitive,ultra-catchy songs and-relatively speaking-spurning bloated albums like the Temptations'\\"Masterpiece\\" or the O'jays'\\"Ship Away\\",with its thirteen-minute\\"soul opera\\"title track on the subject of slavery.They certainly didn't look across the way to rock,where monstrously over-extended records were causing an intense critical backlash against overweening ambition and in favour of-yes-simplicity and acceptability.Disco was the black punk,simple as that.<br />It's often said that it's wrong to blame\\"Sgt.Pepper's...\\"for progressive rock:is it wrong to blame Marvin Gaye for the pomposity of album-based soul?No,because\\"What's Going On\\"is no work of genius-it has all the faults its successors did.A vagueness at its centre,an unwillingness to offer analysis and a reliance instead on vocal technique and empty empathy.Critics ever since have swooned over how\\"brave\\" it was of Gaye to tackle social issues-but why was it brave?The message of the title track boils down to\\"Is it bad thatbad things happen\\",not something anyone could disagree with,but equally not likely to have an effect,to change people's minds.Disco was attacked for its vacuity,but at least it was an HONEST vacuity,whereas most social-issue soul,Gaye's opus included,hid its lack of real commentary under a parade of platitudes and the occasional sob or melismatic howl.The will to comment was there,sure-some singers,like Curtis Mayfield,even had the verbal felicity to do something with it-but it would take hip-hop to open up a space where truly substantive things could be said and thought.Gaye's brand of soul was just sound and technique and signified nothing.It was no surprise at all that it was this stuff that became the bible for\\"serious\\"80s pop music,with even the horrendous Spandau Ballet crooning smugly about\\"Lis'nin' to Maaaaarvin all night long...\\".<br />Motown boss Berry Gordy tried to stop the release of \\"What's Going On\\",and he's been painted as a cloth-eared villain ever since.But Gordy was not a stupid man,and certainly not a philistine:over ten years before he'd written\\"Money\\",after all,which said more intelligent things in a slyer fashion than anything on Gaye's hand-wringing epic.That was the problem.The worst thing about\\"What's Going On\\" wasn't what it caused but what it replaced-the old Motown had been a place where songwriters,their skills honed by hectic competition would turn out three-minute gems with polished(and insightful!)lyrics,brilliant high-impact arrangements and absolutely irresistible beats.By 1971 that version of the company was on the wane anyway,but\\"What's Going On\\" was one big nail in its coffin.So Marvin Gaye helped destroy the best pop label the world ever saw,and in doing so turned soul music into a gigantic supper club.Greatness indeed,I'm sure you'll agree.
B00005QK3B|5.0|Marillion are one of the best modern progressive rock bands of the 80's and early 90's. This is the first album I heard by this wonderful band. It was released in 1985 and was their biggest selling album.....I can see why and you will too when you hear it. This album does nothing for me lyrically, but musically it really moves me. I am not a lyric guy anyway. In fact I would rather hear the music by itself, but I do realize alot of people like vocals so I am not going to knock Fish (Marillion's flamboyant frontman). I am going to say this if you like David Gilmour-style guitar playing than look no further than Marillion's guitarist Steve Rothery. Which the only thing he has in common with Gilmour is the emotional element in his playing. This album has some really breathtaking musicial passages in it. I think one of the most beautiful is when the song &quot;Bitter Suite&quot; gets into it. I almost couldn't believe it when I heard  the section before the &quot;Lavender&quot; reprise passage. You will know what I am talking about if you buy this album or if you have heard the album before. Marillion did a remarkable job with this album and I think it will always hold a special place in my heart just for the very fact that it made me buy most of their albums. I also highly recommend &quot;Clutching at Straws,&quot; &quot;Season's End,&quot; and &quot;Brave.&quot; Misplaced Childhood I hope will be an enjoyable album for you and it should because it is one of the most influential progressive albums of the 1980s. I also recommend for the DVD fans their DVD called &quot;From Sroke Row to Ipanema.&quot; It is VERY good and interesting.

B00009V7P8|4.0|This is a great album, not one of those albums where there are only two or three enjoyable songs. A great CD to listen to and relax -- I definitely recommend this album to anyone who appreciates an acoutsic and vocal type of sound.
B000002ACR|5.0|I'm stunned it took me so long to discover the greatness of this album.  The Byrds were prominent in the 60s, but they were almost too big to see all of what they accomplished.  Because of their shifting personnel and almost soap-opera-like story line, there is probably no single Byrds album that encapsulates their career, but &quot;Younger than Yesterday&quot; is clearly a major summit.  On this collection you get:  David Crosby's best song, &quot;Everybody's Been Burned,&quot; the band's probably best (this is arguable) Dylan cover, &quot;My Back Pages,&quot; the funniest song about rock and roll, &quot;So You Want to be a Rock and Roll Star,&quot; one of the first country rock songs ever, &quot;Time Between,&quot; another nearly perfect Crosby song in his personal journalism mode, &quot;Renaissance Fair,&quot; and the magnificent Four-Freshman-like harmonies meets the Mersey Beat of &quot;Have You Seen Her Face.&quot;  The tracks are compact, many coming in at less than two minutes, but seeming timeless.  The remastering is without doubt the best I've heard.  You even get two terrible songs that are, nonetheless, incredible timepieces of the mid-60s, Crosby's spacy &quot;Mind Gardens&quot; and McGuinn's ridiculous &quot;CTA 102.&quot;  It's just great, and well worth your money.
0385504209|4.0|The Di Vinci Code is a murder mystery that starts out fast paced and easily pulls the reader into its exciting plot, but somehow falls short of expectations by the end.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good summer/beach read but I found the writing predictable, hollow and at points very melodramatic.  If your looking for good writing look elsewhere.  If your looking for fast paced, Hollywood style characters and a plot with an interesting premise this book is the one.<br />The books two main characters Robert Langdon a symbologist and Sophie Neveu a cryptologist meet in an unlikely way; at the murder scene of her grandfather.  The story runs away from there when the two discover an ancient secret tied up with a centuries old society that worships the goddess.  On the run from the police, Sophie and Robert on limited time try to figure out the code and discover what is hidden.  Interesting enough characters to begin with, but they are never really developed and fall into a predictable sequence of boy meets girl patterns. Other characters in the story include; an albino monk, a knight named Sir Leigh Teabing, a bulldog French police captain and a mysterious, faceless character called &quot;the teacher.&quot;  The greatest strength is the research and attention to detail that Brown uses in his plot.  It is fascinating, to read about Da Vinci, the Priory of Scion, Opus Dei and the hundreds of details he works into the plot on religious and pagan symbols.  An interesting, fast read but a bit slow during the second half of the book.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|I am a BIG fan of Sean Connery's and I was happy when he returned for this role, but the movie is not his best. <br />'Thunderball' was good, but for its time, it wasn't ready, I think the action scenes in 'Never Say Never Again' is a great improvment, on Thunderball, and for that alone, I would recommend you to buy it - Just seeing Sean Connery back as Bond, is a good enough reason.
0064407667|3.0|I love all of the series but it is not without its flaws. I must admit that I found the first book to be the least interesting and I can understand why it turns people off. However, if you are even a little intrigued keep on reading. Once you get to the fourth or fifth book things really spice up and you just can't stop.
B000069AUI|5.0|They will probably do it, but I can't imagine how Coldplay will manage to top this cd without parting ways with the sweet, romantic melodies that made them famous. Certain hints are there: Clocks is by far their best song ever (one of the top singles of 2003 as well), but does not talk about love or anything in particular; drums and paino are the main attraction, creating a dense but joyful climate. Daylight goes along those lines as well, but with even more noise all over the place. <br />The traditional Coldplay (that is= killer tunes and melodies that can make you cry) is here, mind you: we all know In My Place or The Scientist, and Green Eyes or Warning Sign give proof that, if Coldplay wanted, they could go on making this type of emotional songs forever.<br />Amsterdam and A Rush Of Blood... are 2 high peaks (and the cd's final songs): they both seem traditional Coldplay at first but then construct themselves until they explode in wonderful tunes where music is so important that the tracks last almost 6 minutes each.<br />They are on top of the game, we know. Next time it will take not only hard work and talent (they have both &quot;in excess&quot;), but also more sense of adventure. But if you can't have faith in the people that gave us &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot;, who could we trust then? The Strokes?

B00009V7P8|3.0|Yes, this is a nice cd and all, but it doesn't break new ground whatsoever in the \\"folk genre\\". This appreciation should not have been considered had the press and other reviewers not given this man so much blessings. The cd is enjoyable, no doubt about it: Delicate breathes sweetness on the surface but has tension lying beneath it; Volcano is sexy and confused; Cold Water creates a truly spooky scenario; Eskimo's last 2 minutes are glorious. That's (more or less) it.<br />Oh, yes, and the lyrics... \\"Love taught me how to cry\\", \\"What am I? A piece of your cake?\\" or \\"I remember it well/the first time that I saw/your head around the door/cause mine stopped working\\". 29 years old, for god's sake. <br />I repeat, If you think you'll like it, don't hesitate to give it a listen. But don't expect this to be anything you haven't heard before. Damien Rice should not produce his own next cd; he's very sensitive but perhaps an external opinion (an experimental one) would make him record one of those albums that aren't easily forgotten.
B00009P1MP|5.0|American Pie always sounded worse (technically) than Don's other albums of this period. Now it sounds as good. The remastering sharpens things up just a little without making it sound artificial, though I thought I detected a little 'pumping' on 'Vincent'.<BR>Of the two extra tracks, 'Aftermath' fits best and is a worthy addition to the album.<BR>I like the new cardboard sleeve and the liner notes (with lyrics).<BR>It's a great album of course, end to end, brilliantly performed and utterly memorable. This remastered version just serves to remind you how very good it is.<BR>Worth buying, or re-buying, for the improved sound and better liner notes.

B00009V7RF|1.0|I loved the song, \\"Where is the love\\" on the radio but when I heard \\"Lets get Retarded\\" I had to ask the same question, Where is the love? Here they are talking about what's wrong in the world and descrimination well what they're saying about people with a disabilty is one of the things that's wrong in the world. And so are they trying to tell me that everyone deserves better except for people with a disabilty? <br />First of all it's not their fault they have a disabilty! My sister has Down syndrome and I love her so much. Personally, that song offends me. Maybe if you buy this CD you should ask yourself, \\"Where is the love?\\"
B00006L7XQ|5.0|There is no one like Johnny Cash. There will never be anyone like him again. With him doing showtunes, however, I worried about this CD. I thought he might be getting too old or just trying too hard. Instead, I was thoroughly amazed by the complexity of this man! Every song is a winner in its own right- even my daughter loves this!
6305546789|5.0|This movie is so cool. Its the greatest horror/slasher movie of all time by far. Friday the 13th is good but its not no  Halloween. It's about a psycho named Micheal Myers who murdered his sister when he was six years old. He was sent to a sanitary and escaped 15 years later. He returns to his home Haddonfield (hence the nickname \\"The Night HE Came Home\\") and stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and you'll find out in H2. Anyway she babysits for a boy on Halloween night and Michael Myers stalks her and her friends and kills them all except her. His doctor at the sanitary, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is trying to find Michael and stop him. I love ... when he sticks the guy to the door with the butcher knife. The closet scene is in my opinion the greatest horror scene ever. This movie is great.
0452282152|2.0|The premise of this novel is an excellent idea, take a well known and revered painting and turn the painter, Vermeer(who history doesn't tell a lot about) and make him one of the main characters in a novel about the girl in the painting. The main character, Griet, has what seems like a severe mulitple personality disorder, one minute she's quietly walking down a street in Holland contemplating her new life, the next she's flirting with the butcher's son and slapping her employer's daughter. The characters are realistic and interesting but they disapoint in how they end up. None of the characters triumph. Her blind father becomes bitter, her mother becomes nosy, her sister dies, her brother gets a married woman pregnant and disapears, Vermeer goes crazy and dies. And the last hope, Griet isn't particulary uplifting either. After stumbling through the anti-climatic plot that is inevitably ruined at every high point by the obnoxious daughter of Vermeer, the main character, Griet, sells out by marrrying a man she didn't love. I read this book in one sitting, but it disapointed me, it could have been much better.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Greendale is a story about the Greens and the album revolves around that story. The album consisit of alot of bluesy riffs, and a acoustic number Bandit, which is a very well written song. And one song on the pipe organ Bringin' down the dinnier. The whole album is great. On the last 2 songs he uses a megaphone to change his voice but it fits perfectly right into the song. The whole album deserves 5 stars. Also great guitar work by Neil, and with his legendary backing band Crazy Horse. Lots of solos. :)                                                                                                                          The DVD acoustic's of Greendale oversea's is good with the charm of Neil Young's story tell'in.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is  simply fantastic. Her voice is beautiful -- full, strong, and sultry. This entire cd is incredible such songs like: &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;Seven Years&quot;, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, and &quot;Shoot the Moon,&quot; are excellent.<br />This entire cd is wonderful, and is excellent to play at dinner parties as a back drop. Or for simply relaxing in front of the fireplace with that special someone, or savoring a quiet evening for two.<br />I, personally, enjoy playing this cd anytime and all the time. I play it because it simply relaxes me and allows me to consider the love of my life and how to care for him the most.<br />I love Norah Jones' cd &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; and hope that she continues to stay around producing romantic ballads for a long time.

B00003CXIP|5.0|This is an AMAZING movie. It touches you the way movies of today dont. Ive read Steven King's &quot;The Body&quot; which is the novella from which &quot;Stand By Me&quot; came from and i love it just as much as the movie. The movie is diffrent in some ways but mostly holds true to the book. I recommened both strongly. This movie is not for the type of people who like no thought movies for this movie is deep. Concerning the language issue, i belive that it is much, but it doesent take away from the movie at all! The language adds to strength of the movie and power. It also holds true to the book in which MUCH MUCH worse language is used. Buy the DVD! :-)
0385509456|4.0|A breeze of a read, Haddon's first-person novel from the point of view of a 15 year old autistic kid in England is garnering much deserved attention.<br />Other reviews point to the realism of autism sufferers, and I'm unable to verify or dispute such claims.  That said, the first person account by this author (who has worked with autistic children) does seem to show an understanding of the Rain Men of the world.  This approach in and of itself keeps the book fascinating.<br />Christopher Boone is playing detective, to find the murderer of a neighbor's dog.  The search leads to domestic discovery that is unsettling for him, and those involved.  The plot is seemingly and afterthought however.  It's the writing style from the pen of the fictitious autistic author that keeps things moving nicely.<br />At times sad, the book is mostly hysterical.  This is not to make light of autism.  But the kid's rants against France and Conan Doyle are laught-out-loud funny.  At times, the book is also very educational, as from the outside, you get an understanding for the &quot;weird&quot; behavior we associate with autism, whether it's the violent reactions to being touched or the mental shut downs that lead the main character to yearn for white noise to calm down.  This first-person account will keep you glued.<br />At times, the book seems rushed.  There are some inconsistent angles to the main character.  For instance, he doesn't like his plate to have foods touching, yet he doesn't mind a sandwich with four or more ingredients.  Early in the book, our autistic hero constantly reminds us of white lies and similies, but as the book drags on, Haddon seems to drift from his original approach.  That said, the hitches are minor, and are not a deterrent.<br />The book is unique, and such a brisk read that you can't go wrong with giving it a whirl.  The emotion that bleeds from the pages are fascinating, considering the main character's autism denies him the ability to understand suchemotions on complex levels.  From that, true understanding can arise.
0800141326|2.0|A big-budget American version of Japan's most beloved import? How could it fail? Well, whatever could go wrong did. This mega-hyped disaster of a monster movie was a thinly-disguised rip-off of \\"Jurassic Park\\" that pretty much used the name \\"Godzilla\\" to hide the fact that it was so blatanly unoriginal.<br />The story follows Dr. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) as he is called into investigate a mysterious shipwreck off the coast of some Asian territory. As it turns out, these problems are actually being caused by a radioactive iguana on a collision course with New York City. When the creature arrive, all hell breaks loose and the army is called in to take it out. After several failed attempts, the monster ends up under the city as Broderick and a team of French special operatives head to the ruins of what was once Madison Sqaure Garden to hunt down the nest. Chaos ensues again and they end up getting chased through the city by the monster for one big predictable finale.<br />The idea of making a Godzilla movie where Godzilla does not use his infamous radioactive breath is about as half-baked an idea as Sean Cunningham doing a Jason movie without using the hockey mask. Here in lies the biggest problem with major studios, these days. They are so consumed by the thought of making money that they never really stop and think about what the true fans of the movies want to see. I have always felt that if you are going to make a remake or a sequel or a big-budget movie based on a TV series, that it should at the very least offer some type of improvement or something new over the original. The \\"Godzilla\\" in this movie is esentially a giant one-dimenionsal lizard that seems more like the monster featured in \\"Varan The Unbelivable\\" than that of the classic Godzilla. Let's face it. The older Godzilla would stomp the life out of this one. Not to mention that the makers of this movie did a much better job at the sci-fi disaster angle with their last film, \\"Independence Day\\" and Godzilla was much more meaningful in \\"Godzilla 1985\\". This movie falls flat on its face.and Godzilla was much more meaningful in \\"Godzilla 1985\\". This movie falls flat on its face.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This film, although violent, is a great testament to what makes us human beings and unique.  Human nature will not be contain, controled or limited.  I would prefer Christian Bale over Keanu Reeves any day!
B000005PMN|3.0|Looking for good pointless buddy action? Look no further. Before Brandon Lee's unforunate and tragic death and Dolph Lundren's exile to straight-to-video fare, the two did this average and predictable but fun and fast-paced action film. Lundgren is the American trained in the Hong Kong style while Lee is vice-versa and the two are looking to track down the always-evil Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who is the distributor of a new lethal form of drugs that is killing kids on the streets. If that's not enough, Tagawa murdered Dolph's parents when he was just a child so this is a mission of revenge.<br />At just a little bit over an hour and ten minutes, this movie gets right to the point and fast. You get a whole lot of kicking and shooting but not too much of anything else. If you are a fan of either Lundgren or Lee then it's worth a look but non-action fans may want to skip this.
B000092ZYX|2.0|This is such a letdown!!  Radiohead tries to hit a fine-line somewhere between OK Computer and Kid A - and the result leaves their sound NOWHERE.  A half-hearted, half-a**ed, middle-of-nowhere mess that does not excite in the least.  Coldplay are apparently the new Radiohead...let's hope they can stay the course. Radiohead are so over.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The firefly class starship Serenity housed a mismatched crew of brigands and gentleman, holymen and [ill-repute women] - ok, there was actually only one of each 'type' of character, but they acted and interacted in real, believable ways. A better show than any Star Trek series (and I love Star Trek), the characters quickly moved from two dimensional \\"character types\\" to multi-dimensional characters with heights and depths that in most cases (Jayne excepted, perhaps  :) would not have been expected. <br />Even more surprising, this show had broad appeal. Both my wife and I loved it, and outside of comedy, our tastes in TV and movies differ radically. She is simply not interested in most science fiction, yet we both enjoyed Firefly. It was a rare, quality TV show that we could both appreciate, even though episodes were aired out of order - the storyline continued from episode to episode even though the actual stories usually did not - and was preempted by sporting events several times during it's 12 episode run.<br />Fox dumped the show that, could quite possibly have been the next Buffy, or perhaps even the next Star Trek.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|An amazing recording and a good story with an environmental (WAKE UP CALL)message.  A raw sound (as if you are sitting in the studio)that fits this recording perfectly.  Possibly the Horse's best!  My only question...why is there no Poncho?  Do not hesitate to purchase this.
B00000HZFP|4.0|I can't stop listening to this CD . . . and I can't get these songs out of my head. \\"Angry Inch\\" and \\"Wig in a Box\\" are always fun. (And \\"Midnight Radio\\" sounds sincere every time.)<br />A few minor complaints: (1) \\"Random Number Generation\\" isn't up to the level of the other songs. It's a by-the-numbers hard rock song. Bon Jovi should play it live. (2) There's no good reason to make a cut between \\"Hedwig's Lament\\" and \\"Exquisite Corpse.\\" On random play, you can clearly hear a good song being cut in half.<br />Other than that, this is a perfect album. The songs are fast and funny, the subject matter is straight out of a Monty Python movie, and no one screwed up the CD by sticking dialogue from the Broadway show into the mix --- it's just the music.
B00005JKBC|5.0|i had to write this for one reason, it seems spy game is not getting its just reward. it has been a long time since hollywood made a decent suspense filled movie without explicit gore or nudity. in fact this movie, quit reminds me of older and by far better movies of hollywoods good days. today most movies are just pure [junk]. i expected not to like this movie at all and left this movie with a feeling of satisfaction. and even though it was not a comedy i found myself to be very amused by redfords ways. always a step ahead.this movie is worth owning
B000089RVX|5.0|I purchased this album on a whim after being in Little Rock, AR and hearing them being interviewed as a 'home town band'.  Come to find out they're from Little Rock and there was some local contraversy because they'd said on a syndicated radio show that they were from LA.  That's neither here no there, but it made me buy the album on a whim.<br />The Top 40 song I'm refering to is 'Bring Me to Life' which features the lead singer and some one else.  While not a terrible song by a long shot it's just that when you have a band come out of nowhere advertised as part of a soundtrack (Daredevil) you wonder if this is another Proclaimers a la Benny and Joon.<br />however, the rest of this album is missing that someone else  -  and I don't miss them at all.<br />From the opening track Going Under you get kicked in the teeth with the strong guitar intro, to her ever so haunting voice in 'My Immortal' this is an excellent ride through the entire album and I highly recommend it.

B00009P1O5|4.0|You can count me among the true blue Neil Young fans; I have all his albums &amp; can find something to like in every one, some much more than others.  This one, reviled in 1981 and not given much more credit over time, is among my favorites.  How this missed becoming known as a proto-grunge classic I'll never know. My best guess is that nobody can make it past &quot;T-Bone&quot;, 9 minutes of one riff and two lyrics.  Well now that it's on CD you can program that one and maybe &quot;Get Back On It&quot; out, and you're left with one of the best examples of Neil's unchained id.  &quot;Shots&quot; is the most frighteningly intense moment in the Crazy Horse canon, guitars and horrified voices screaming through a hail of machine gun fire, and could go toe to toe with Napalm Death in the hair-raising dept.  Southern Pacific, one of the few tracks to be revived in concert periodically, takes us on a train ride through the eyes of a forcibly-retired engine worker.  &quot;Rapid Transit&quot; offers cryptic, seemingly random phrases sung with a speech impediment - &quot;M-m-m-m-m-m-meltdown / C-c-c-c-c-c-c-containment&quot; - before reaching a rousing chorus; &quot;Hang ten, pipeline, let's go trippin' - every wave is new until it breaks!&quot; Open letter to David Byrne?  &quot;Opera Star&quot; and &quot;Surfer Joe &amp; Moe The Sleaze&quot; are musically simple, but the playing could burn barns; more than anything you can sense Neil's excitement at playing loud, simple things that FEEL good.  It'd take till 1989's &quot;ElDorado&quot; to approach this level of sturm und drang again.  Buy this if you are a fan of louder Neil stuff like Ragged Glory, Rust Never Sleeps and Arc; you may wish to avoid if you are more into his mellow side - this one ain't no Sugar Mountain, more like Paranoid Valley.
0684800713|4.0|I read The Sun Also Rises for one of my summer reading requirements. Initially, I was skeptical as to whether I would enjoy Hemingway, but in the end it turned out to be one of my favorite books.<br />The story begins with the introduction of a group of friends who are living in France after World War I. They go out to notorious cafes, luxurious restaurants, and wild clubs and try to drink away their disillusionment with themselves. When that doesn't seem to allievate the problem, they venture out to Spain, once again attempting to run away from their tribulations.<br />The book is set in a generally mellow atmosphere which can get a bit slow at times, but the whimsical characters allow for more exciting events such as the bullfights, the fights, and the conversations.<br />This book is strikingly familiar to The Great Gatsby. However, this proves no coincidence as Hemingway and Fitzgerald were friends during their time spent in Europe with the rest of the expatriates. This novel reflects the lives of the &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; and will most certainly leave you entertained.

0156027321|5.0|This is a book that will revive you spiritually.  Pi Patel is a brilliant character, full of life and inspiration.  A victorious ending was promised, but I can't bear it when something is so psychologically and emotionally painful that it has to be masked with a fabricated story.  I don't know what exactly happened to Pi Patel, but it was a painful experience.  Great book though.  I'd like to meet him.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Well I have read all the books that I could get (Its not that easy here in Ecuador)and I was really happy with the movie. I agree that some changes were kinda odd, specially the thing about Faramir. Sure it gives him a better reason to let Frodo go, but I think that it was a little too much. Anyway it's a richer character than the Faramir from the book so I gues we can forgive them for that.<BR>Anyway I can't wait to get the extended edition, specially with those 40 plus minutes. I guess that Gollum's story is gonna be there. <BR>I think that the producers did an excellent job portraying the world of Tolkien and the essence of the plot and the drama. Telling a story in a film is very different than in a book cause all the things that you imagine while you read have to be shown in a couple minutes.<BR>I'm just waiting for the Return of the King.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Just making sure this album has the rating it deserves. Give it five listens. If you can't really get into it after that, I'm sorry. It's awesome.
B00000255F|5.0|You like rock and roll?  OK, then!  As far as I am concerned, this is rock and roll.  Bruce puts it all together on this album in a way that redefines that amoeboid musical trend known as rock.  I don't believe there is an album that more consistently refreshes the memory of what rock is founded upon, and what it is capable of.  The lyrics are blues, nothing more, nothing less.  The guitar work is something out of the rockabilly era combined with the soul and swing that makes jazz and motown move the way they do.  And, Oh yeah, did I mention Clarence on Sax?  This is early Springsteen, which means revved up, active and energetic songs about the worst things that the American life can throw at you, making them real and beautiful and sad at the same time.  If you don't own this album, I think you do a disservice to Rock greats like the Beatles, Elvis, Buddy Holly, AL Green, James Brown, The Temptations, and all the jazz and blues artists that influenced them.  I don't know which is more quintessentially Bruce, this or Born in the USA, but if Born is in the Title of a Springsteen album, you can't go wrong.
0805062971|5.0|this was a book iread when i felt really blah. it cheered me up and definitely made me laugh my [rear] off. i like this book better than survivor. which is odd; because usually authors don't develop a palatable style until they've been around for a while.

Why? Because we all loved this movie. It's a classic English \\"Caper\\" story about a group of 2nd rate crooks from London who set out to steel millions in Gold Bullion from Turin. It's funny, it's got pace, it's got classic performances from Noel Coward, Michael Caine (yes he was that young once), Benny Hill (I don't see it but I am told he's quite amusing), the Classic Mini & quite possibly the best car chase ever.

B000084T18|1.0|it seems like every day has been &quot;shorties&quot; birthday ever since the song &quot;in da club&quot; was released. i hate 50 cent. i hate rap music.

B000099T2L|3.0|I have never been a fan of Beyonce Knowles', but I have to say that her solo debut, &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; is pretty good. Beyonce has the ability to show off her writing skills although I wasn't very thrilled with all of the songs on the CD.<br />Stand-out tracks:<br />Me, Myself, and I<br />The Closer I Get To You (duet with Luther Vandross)<br />Most of the other songs on the CD just fall into the same old R&amp;B/pop category. While her first single &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; definitely gets you up dancing, many of the other dance tracks seem somewhat forced. All in all I would say this is a pretty good effort.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The only reason I'm writing this is to being the overall rating of this album up.  The Cranky Reviewer is obviously someone looking for sub-celebrity internet status by writing self-important, unfunny gag reviews (burn your modem and get a job, dude).<br />To those of you out there who DO hate this album and won't give Radiohead a chance because you LEGITIMATELY think they're pretentious: you're missing the point.  OK Computer is a rallying cry against a pretentious society where the haves are finally about to defeat the have-nots and put them in cages with TV's, 401k's, and Tae Bo tapes.  Track seven alone is evidence of this (yes, even Radiohead's filler speaks volumes).  The world Thom Yorke writes about here has gone mad and the music here is a reflection of it.  Using keyboards and borrowing a sound technique from Aphex Twin when it works is not a sign of pretentiousness.  It's called &quot;trying to do something different.&quot;<br />OK Computer is not an easy listen and it wasn't meant to me.  It's a warning.  A big one.  Ignore it at your own risk, or wake up and recognize it for the piece of history that it is.

B00003CX8U|3.0|&quot;All That Jazz&quot; is a semi-autobiographical recounting of Bob Fosse's life.  Directed by the master himself, the film follows Broadway producer, Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider)as he spirals into an oblivion of drug addiction, alcoholism and womanizing while preparing to launch his greatest show yet.  Joe is ably pushed to the edge of the great beyond by the lovely Angel of Death (Jessica Lange)who eventually gets her wish.  This is perhaps the only time in my viewing experience that a musical film has given me chills.  The entire plot functions on the mental anguish of its protagonist and his inevitable demise and the final few moments are truly unsettling.<BR>So is FOX's DVD transfer quality; the image suffers from dated - often muddy - colors, washed out and pasty flesh tones, weak blacks, an excessive amount of film grain and various age related artifacts that generally detract from the visual experience.  Edge enhancement and pixelization are big problems in certain scenes but others appear to be free of their frustrating inclusion. The soundtrack is Stereo Surround, well balanced though, on occasion, strident.  <BR>EXTRAS: An interview with Scheider while he was making the film that is needlessly divided into chapter stops that don't matter.  Ditto for several snippets of Fosse at work on the set. The theatrical trailer is also included.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: If you simply can't live without this film - as I could not (for its brilliant story telling vision and disconcerted charm)then I recommend it highly.  The transfer, however, will disappoint - especially for a film of seventies vintage!

B00005JLSE|3.0|&quot;Chicago&quot; is the Academy Award winning musical from 2002 that brought back the genre in elegant style.  Set during the rum running twenties, the plot loosely follows to murderesses (Catherine Zeta Jones-Douglas and Rene Zellweger) who are awaiting their fate on death row.  Enter the over confident lawyer (Richard Gere)who promises to make it all better.  Electrifying musical numbers rock this rather flat story and bump up the action a well deserved notch - but was this really the Best Picture of 2002?!?!<BR>Mirimax's DVD won't be winning any awards.  Colors are well balanced but flesh tones are overly pinkish and flat.  Fine details are lost in the darker scenes, even when viewing the movie in a completely blackened room.  Edge enhancement and aliasing crop up now and then, though nothing that will terribly distract.  Film grain is a real problem - certain scenes are smooth as silk while others look as though they are at least twenty years old. (Herein I am not making references to the stylistic aged look employed during certain segments of the movie but various shots within a particular scene that veer wildly between generally smooth to excessively grainy.  Check out Zeta Jone's &quot;All That Jazz&quot; number that opens the film. When Rene Zellweger intrudes with her own bar and chorus, the background information in the shot is suddenly riddled with grit, grain and a digital harshness.)  Not a terrible mastering effort - just not an exemplary one and for a BEST PICTURE WINNER of one year vintage, entirely unacceptable.  The audio is 5.1 and DTS but neither are particularly distinguished though both offer an aggressive bass and some kick during the musical numbers.<BR>EXTRAS:A deleted song, audio commentary and theatrical trailer.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: I would have at least expected a &quot;making of&quot; for this movie but I suppose Miramax is holding that back for a special &quot;deluxe&quot; edition sure to be out before Christmas.  This is a very disappointing over all marketing of a BEST PICTURE - especially one that garnered tons of critical attention and a host of awards!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I just want to say to all of you complaining about the overuse of the bullet time cinematography...That's what makes The Matrix The Matrix!  Just because 8 thousand other movies copied them and made it almost cliche, you can't tell the Wachowski brothers to give up their creation that makes these movies what they are.  It is a MUST that they use this in order for the movies to flow!  Of course it would be hard for them to top the first Matrix, but this is a good movie, and I hope that when the third one comes out it will make Reloaded an important part of the set.
B000062XM3|5.0|Do you enjoy movies that brim with psychological suspense and an almost incomprehensible plot?? Whether your answer is yes or no, you should currently have a list of movies engraved within your memory that fit the criteria. Are you grasping for answers?? Here are, in my opinion, several flicks that fit the bill. (&quot;&quot;Plulp Fiction,&quot;&quot; ... &quot;&quot;Memento,,&quot;&quot; ... &quot;&quot;Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas,&quot;&quot; ... &quot;The Last Broadcast,,&quot;&quot; ... &quot;&quot;The Ring,,&quot;&quot;... &quot;&quot;True Romance&quot;&quot; ... &quot;Resevoir Dogs&quot;&quot;... &quot;Four Rooms&quot;&quot;... &quot;&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;&quot;... &quot;&quot;Seven&quot;&quot;... &quot;&quot;The Game&quot;&quot;... &quot;&quot;Dead Presidents&quot;&quot;... &quot;&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;&quot;... take your pick... and enjoy.
0156907399|5.0|The Freudian take regarding To the Lighthouse has been almost beaten to death.  I think that anyone who focuses too much on the phallic symbolism of the Lighthouse itself in this work does so to their own detriment.  Why?  Because To the Lighthouse could perhaps be Virginia Woolf's most finely crafted work.  <br />If one were to look too deeply into the symbolism they may miss the beautifully painted character portrait of Mrs. Ramsey as the stolid maternal who really holds the family, household, and social interactions of her husband together while he goes about dreaming and philosophizing, only to have to pick the pieces up later when she dies and he is left alone.<br />To the Lighthouse is filled with wonderful and memorable characters.  Not just Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, but also Lila Briscoe the aritst, and Minta Doyle the carefree young almost self absorbed girl in a woman's body.  Then there is Mr. Carmichael who appears kind of an old wizened sage who remains somewhat aloof but finally finds success as a poet at the end of the novel.  There's Tansley the anti-social atheist intellectual who may still have a softer side somewhere beneath his cold exterior...the list goes on and on...and by now I'm probably rambling, but anyway, To the Lighthouse is Virgina's Woolf best and everyone who reads it should be able to find something they can appreciate about it.
B000089RVX|3.0|OK, first this is a good album.<BR>Second, this is also a marketing miracle. Just about everybody thinks that Evenescence is a Nu Metal band, and it is promoted as such. But with the exception of \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and one or two other tracks this sounds VERY close to European Goth Metal bands like The Gathering or Lacuna Coil. Tracks like \\"Whisper\\", \\"Tourniquet\\" or \\"Imaginary\\" are 100% Goth while the \\"ballads\\" are much darker than your standard metal ballads. If you really like their music then you must check out the last two albums by the italian goth band Lacuna Coil (\\"Comalies\\" and \\"Unleashed Memories\\"). You'll then discover the band they were inspired by (or for others the band they ripped off).<br />So this is a good album ... and a marketing masterpiece.
0783226063|1.0|Having just read the book, I decided to rent the DVD.  What a complete and total disaster.  <br />The only two things I actually enjoyed about this were the designs of the stillsuits and the casting of Max von Sydow as Kynes.<br />The story is so compressed that all sense of scope, depth, and purpose are completely undermined.  The acting alternates between wooden and melodramatic.  The Harkonnens have been transformed into circus [figures].  Nearly everybody is miscast.<br />And worst of all, it's BORING!<br />This movie should have been put on a shelf and never released.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|One word can describe this movie: Excellent!<br />The ones that complain about the movie simple don't understand its depth. Every single action in the second movie had a meaning and there was a meaning for every extra minute devoted for each scene. If you just see the movie thinking it has to be self explanatory then this is not your movie. To understand The Matrix you will need the three installments and then you will realize why the scenes were the way they were filmed (i.e. Zion, Smith-Neo battle, etc). Each scene had a special meaning that would be clarified in Revolutions. In fact, I recommend people to watch this movie and then watch again The Matrix (the first movie) and they will see how things in the first movie that appeared to be disconnected now make complete sense (dialogues, for instance, like the Smith dialogue with Morpheus, which is really explaining its unknown nature as a virus). <br />All I say is that there is much more in The Matrix than people will ever discover, and I am sure that after the second installment, we still know nothing about The Matrix and what it really is...maybe we'll be surprised...<br />As a conclusion, Reloaded is a piece of art, but to fully appreciate its finest details the complete saga is needed.
080018789X|1.0|I must be crazy.  I think Cruise is an excellent actor, and so are all the other participants in this movie.  And the writing is pretty snazzy too.  The problem is the plot is ridiculous.<BR>Evil agent suddenly becomes Good agent and then spends rest of the time up to no particular good, or much of anything.<BR>Also, young single mom QUITS JOB because Evil agent SUDDENLY announces he's good?  Quits job so that rich evil agent who suddenly becomes poor can't pay her anymore after offering her job?  I give up.
B00005JLXE|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. Going into the theater, I felt slighly excited, I have been a long time fan of the Frank Miller version of Daredevil, and I had heard that director had brought Miller in to help with the film's visuals. So I settled in, and watched. The movie starts fast, and quickly moves through daredevil's origin, which I enjoyed - then they have a very good scene of the boy daredevil being woken by a booming drip and we see his radar &quot;vision&quot; working. Then it went downhill fast. <BR>  Some of my major problems with the film was I just didnt belive daredevil did those crazy moves. He jumps at least 10 feet down, falls another ten feet, and then again.. I expected him to be at least a few inches shorter when he hit the ground. And there is one more thing at the end that bugs me... but I won't give that away.<BR>It does fullfill as an action movie, and you gotta see like 40 million dollars in action flyin across the screen. But don't think too much.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|Arnold vs. Big Louie.  Arnold trained at the world-famous Gold's Gym in California, having fun in the sun.  Ferrigno trained in Brooklyn in a dark gym without anyone even resembling a bodybuilder.  Simply put, this is an amazing documentary telling the story of Arnold becoming a 5-time champion.  This movie launched the careers of both bodybuilders.  It shows how Arnold was able to motivate himself, manipulate others, and simply dominate; it also shows Ferrigno's struggle with his father.<br />Hopefully there will be quite a bit of extra footage included in this disc.  Cinemax has been showing 40 minutes of \\"never-before seen footage,\\" and there are reportedly thousands of hours left.  Even if this is a bare-bones DVD, it is worth it for any gym rat, any fan of Arnold's or Ferrigno's, or simply anyone interested in a great, true story.

B00005BJ2O|3.0|i loved the movie and what it did musically. so of course i was hoping to get the soundtrack and relive those memorable renditions of popular songs, especially by nicole and ewan. but why oh why did i have to be bombarded with all this other junk? i understand that some people like to have these other songs added in that aren't in the movie. but can't you separate the two? there are 2 separate soundtracks for the movie. so why couldn't one of them be purely movie soundtrack and the other disc be made up of all that 'inspired by' stuff? they do this to my everytime. the chicago soundtrack was absolutely wonderful until the they stuck in those oddball songs at the end. please, if the song didn't make it into the movie, it doesn't really need to be on the soundtrack.
0441003257|5.0|I really wish there were something above five stars that I could give this novel.  It is probably my all-time favorite book.

The result is a book that made me laugh until my sides hurt, but also gave me a chance to think about the good and evil that are intrinsic parts of humanity.<BR>Someone recommended this to me as \\"a funny book about the Apocalypse\\", and I was a little nervous -- I've never read the Bible, so would I not \\"get\\" the jokes?

B00009P1O5|5.0|Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleeze are two of the characters and one of the songs on this, seriously rocking, album. Opera Star, Shots, Get Back on It, Southern Pacific, Motor City & Rapid Transit are all fine serious ROCK.  T-Bone has a little riff, but few lyrics to reccomend it.<br />Motor City has a line that may well require translation for today's younger listeners:  Datsun was the former name of the Nissan automobile company.  There may, or may not be too many Datsuns in this town any more....<br />Southern Pacific is a freight train of a song.  It carries a loud, heavy load and reflects upon the fact that these machines and their crew are disappearing.  <br />Get Back On It is another serious test of your stereo, and while it may be too late for General Custer & Robert E. Lee, it's not too late to buy this fine hard rock album from one of the masters of the field.  Think I'll get back on the highway<BR>I hope I'll see you soon....

0385259409|3.0|The only reason I first picked up this book is because I heard so much buzz about it. I found Australia to be a mildly interesting country and a place I'd love to visit, but would I really want to listen to someone describe their travels there? YES. Bill Bryson made me crack up laughing as he worked he away across the continent known as Australia. From Uluru to Sydney and all the way to lonely Perth, I found myself utterly wrapped up in Bryson's tales of his travels, which included sprinklings of history, plant and animal life, and racism. Except for a dry area in the middle, I found the book to be rather fast moving. If you want to read a wonderfully concise, witty writer, and get a real feel to Australia, pick up this book!
0385504209|1.0|The book is a waste of time for any serious reader.  If you want to learn about the many interesting historical, symbological, and religious factoids that are sprinkled throughout the text, read a synopsis.  But you will not be entertained by this novel.  The author can undoubtedly turn out a respectable academic paper, but he should have had collaboration in writing a work of fiction.  Quite simply, he cannot construct a plot that builds tension and drives the story.  His characters are shallow and give the reader little reason to care about them.  The heroes aren't heroic and the villains are bland.  The worst part is the dialogue, which is unrealistic, stilted, often inappropriate, and rather juvenile.  The author also shares a flaw with Robert Ludlum... whenever a seemingly insurmountable problem arises, he pops up a new character who has the solution.  After a while, we anticipate this and lose any feeling of tension, fear, dread, excitement, etc. that would normally keep us turning the pages.<br />As for the main theses of the book... the &quot;truth&quot; regarding the life and death of Jesus, the meaning of the Holy Grail, the suppression of the feminine roots of Christianity, and the roles of various secret societies... again all of this can be learned about in a few minutes' works on the Internet.<br />I regret the hours I spent plodding through this clunker... I'd have done better reading Harry Potter!
B000084T18|1.0|It's called bad poetry with an attitude. Put a constant, droning, hypnotic beat behind it and it will sell a million copies. And while 50 cent and Eminem and every other identical practitioner of the fine art of the mundane cliche, aka 'keeping it real,' continue with this drivel; fans of actual music understand the phenomenon for what it is. Namely, that rappers and their fans are terrified of standing out from the crowd, making originality of thought or expression a virtual impossibility.
6302517036|5.0|The effects may be a bit off by the standards of the 21st century but when this movie came out there were good, not great, but good.  Chris Sarandon is an excellent vampire and Roddy MacDowell is good in almost anything.  Interesting twists on some vampire legends.  I think it has few plot holes and I was never bored with it. Can't say the same for it poor sequel.  My favorite line from the movie is: &quot;you have to have faith; it doesn't work if you don't have faith&quot; because I think that gets to a core truth of the legends and of religion.

B00005JKCH|5.0|Back in the 70's when Marvel tested the TV waters, I thought how great it was...times change and if you happen to see the televised Spidy, look closely at the wire running up the building and his hands and feet not even touching...a true mar-vel indeed! With that being said--did I really begin a sentence with \\"with\\"...in any event, what a great movie with respect to depth of characters, emotions and really great special effects which do not over shadow the storyline or interfere with interaction between the cast of characters.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Okay, the Matrix was amazing, I loved it, blah blah blah.  Everybody knows this stuff.  The Matrix Reloaded was a disappointment.  First of all, since M2 & M3 are really two parts to one long movie, you get all of the build up for a four hour movie at the beginning of Matrix Reloaded... way too much down time to start a story with such energy.  The Zion \\"orgy\\"/Neo-Trinity crossover was totally unneccessary and just seemed gratuitous.  The story is not one about sex, the first movie didn't have that kind of stuff in it, and this one didn't need it either.  The Agent Smith-Neo battle was way too long and way to redundant.  We got the idea after 2 or 3 minutes.  The story is a pretty deep and thought provoking one, but did they have to make it soooooooo complicated?  It finally got to the point that I didn't care anymore what was real and who would win.  The video game tie-in is kind of cool, but I'm sure some of that substory in the game would have been better in the film.  It couldn't have been worse than some of the scenes that actually made it on screen.  The one redemptive attribute of the Matrix Reloaded is the highway fight scene.  I guess it was worth sitting through all of the garbage to see that, but I would recommend just skipping to that part if you're watching at home.  And then the movie ends... in mid-scene.  A cliffhanger?  No, a disappointment.  I own the first one, I'll never buy this one, and I'll probably wait to rent the next one.  The Matrix Reloaded missed the mark big time.
B00009P1O0|5.0|29 years ago &quot;On the Beach&quot; arrived to a hail of negative reviews. Rolling Stone was particularly cruel. Everyone wanted Harvest, Neil as usual wasn't cooperating. Bleak, depressing, and maybe his most honest work.&quot;on the Beach&quot; stands alone as<BR>one of the greatest works of the Youngsters career. Documenting<BR>the Laurel Canyon period, Revolution Blues, reportedly a song<BR>about the Manson Family, and his short association with same is almost hysterical in tone. Ambulance Blues is just plain Gorgeous. and For the Turnstyles reflects on the duality of stardom. Neil has often said that he prefers the sound of these albums in their original format; ANALOG, but this sounds great on CD. It's nice to have a copy of this on vinyl if nothing else just for the cover, but An LP that still stands up as social comentary, and great musicianship is finally available to the masses.
B00008BRDX|5.0|Recorded in 1979 when the brotherly infighting was still innocent and sparking a collective creativity. Not to say that the later stuff was poor, just that Sting's influence sort of upset the balance. This, their second record, catches the band at its most playful and energetic. Every song has something different to offer, even Copeland's silly &quot;On Any Other Day&quot; which he atones for with &quot;Does Everyone Stare&quot;. In fact, Stewart almost steals the show with his unbelievable skills on the drums, but really all three display excellent musicianship. Andy Summers' chord phrasing is otherworldly. Songs like &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Bed's Too Big Without You&quot; achieve a synergy that was rare in rock music in earlier decades and is nonexistant today. The last song--&quot;No Time This Time&quot;--is a B-side from a year earlier, when they were still flirting with the punk sound, but it's a good, fast song and fits in nicely.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I have heard many people say that they didn't like Reloaded.  They site various reasons.  I think that the true undercurrent to their thought processes is that they may lack the intellect to appreciate good story telling and amazing attention to detail. \\"dude?\\"  This film leaves the viewer asking questions.  I think that Reloaded is likely the best sequel since Empire Strikes Back.  Yes it has superior special effects; yes it has some of the best fight scenes ever filmed.  However, it is a larger movie than that.  It has the one thing that so many movies lack today...plot.  With strong characters, fine acting, and a setting that is obviously loved by the creators, this series will emerge as the some of the greatest cyber punk films since Blade Runner.  I think that many people don't like it because they don't understand it.  Unfortunately, American society wants everything spoon fed to them.  Most want to go to a movie and watch girls in tight clothing do stupid stuff and say silly lines...i.e. Charlie's Angels.  Many people who don't like Reloaded prefer lame brain movies like Legally Blonde or other such trash.  Sadly, Hollyweird always takes the hint (that is why we have shelves of crap.)  However, on rare occasions when they generate a great film like Reloaded it makes me think that some people have the same desires I do....movies with a sense of purpose and a plot that makes your head hurt.  Fantastic Film....see it.  Forget the hype.  This is quality stuff.
B00005V9HA|5.0|I can't put into words how great this movie is.  Jeffrey Combs is hilarous as the would-be Frankenstein Re-Animator.  Lots-o-Blood for you gore hounds.  Many bonuses to be found, as well.  Check it out, and don't expect it to follow the H.P. Lovercraft story completely.  What movie ever does?  Now if only they would re-release &quot;Bride of the Re-Animator.&quot;
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Boo hoo I read people complain about how theres no more mystery to the movie and the world of the matrix. How it is all just time in between fights that are just yawn earning at best. Well if there is no mystery please tell me hwat exactly is the matrix then? The only reason why people dont like the whole depth that reloaded goes into is that most of the public just wants the media to feed it somthing to fill it up with mindless violence and sex, its funney but this movie does it doesnt it no wait theres somthing under all that isnt there. I believe this movie is amazing, the fight scenes are astounding, the whole feeling under the movie is there is more to is than what most people want to get out of it, the movie feeds a deeper intelectual side that most dont, or cant rather. this movie is amazing and the wachowski bros are true artists in a time where art isnt just not understood but not appreaciated
B0000009OP|5.0|Ths album is simply fantastic- not a weak song on it.  However, I'm sure this album will not fit everyone's taste.  This is music stripped down to its bare essentials.  If you like the overblown pretentiousness of Radiohead, perhaps you should steer clear of this band.  <br />It's a damn tragedy Mark Sandman has passed- yet another talent gone way before his time.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Musicals can be boring. This one is certainly not boring, but not a masterpiece. Directing is excellent and so is the execution of stage numbers. Plot is average, but does keep you interested. Richard has aged; not bad for an attorney, but not so appealing as a stage performer. Cathrine is stunning. I expected a lot more from the DTS sound, but I was dissappointed. The bright reds on the DVD puzzled my expensive DLP projector and appeared oversaturated. A fun 2 hours.
0060536942|3.0|STORY: As one editorial put so nicely: \\"Today the quest is to make machines that would be about 1,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Enter Jack Forman, a recently unemployed writer of predator/prey software, whose nearly absentee wife, Julia, is a bigwig at a tech firm called Xymos. When a car accident hospitalizes Julia, Xymos hires Jack to deal with problems at their desert nanotechnology plant. The techies at this plant have developed nanomachines, smaller than dust specks, which are programmed with Jack's predator/prey software. Not only is a swarm of those nanomachines loose and multiplying, but they appear to be carnivorous.\\"<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING - Silicon Valley is where things originate. Believable and functional for this story. Nevada is another local and it too is necessary and logical. The setting is something most of us can envision and/or relate to.<br />2) CHARACTERS - Our main protagonist is the image of many men in America today = unemployed by the high-tech field, finding dead ends to job leads and trying to help out in the household between job searches. This character and the rest are easily believable and give us enough sympathy for thier plight that there is a connection. Actions are logical and in character.<br />3) PLOT - This is where the story lags in my opinion...The reason I don't read Tom Clancy is due to the pages and pages of technical explaination that go into his writing. This book suffers from the same plague of too much exposition. The \\"conflict\\"/antagonist isn't very easily explained like in the Jurassic Park books so more pages are needed in order to give the reader a surface understanding of what is going on with the out of control technology. Based on other reviews it appears this is the biggest turn-off for most readers, myself included.<br />The rest of the story is ok regardless of any formularic plotting involved. The level of suspense is not near that of T-Rex or Raptor for me even though the reality of nano-virus should be more fearsome. IT is almost analogous to give me a live terrorist or show me a facility that manufactures bio-weaponry. The \\"physical\\" threat seems more urgent in such cases in my opinion, regardless of how naive or misguided that might be.<br />4) AUDIOBOOK READING - the reader of the book does a fair job. Descent acting throughout. He does not make use of acting in different voices in order to dramatize the reading more, but it wasn't necessary.<br />OVERALL - Go and read Timeline by Critchon...it is a much better book. You don't have to waste your time, but any true fan of this author will still probably want to read it just to say they've read everything by him. Good luck.reality of nano-virus should be more fearsome. IT is almost analogous to give me a live terrorist or show me a facility that manufactures bio-weaponry.

B00007M5CO|4.0|This album is an excellent example of how, through music, a compromised can be made between young and old. I found it to be highly representative of rioplatense youth; the soul of tango from the perspective of electronica. A breath of fresh air, very uplifting.
630416923X|5.0|I borrowed the 8 VHS tapes from the library and am sorry I didn't watch this sooner.  Talk about a trip back in time!<br /><br />This gives THE complete history of the world's greatest rock and roll band, the ones who started it all, the originals who have been often imitated but never duplicated.<br /><br />After watching the entire Anthology, you think you've watch the evolvement of two different bands.  It was one band from 1964-1966, the height of Beatlemania, when they toured the world and did live (and taped) appearances on nearly every country's major shows (e.g. The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops).  From late-1966, after their final concert in San Francisco, to the end, they were a completely different band.<br /><br />It was interesting to learn that one of the reasons why they stopped touring, besides the screaming that made it impossible for them to hear themselves playing, was because the songs were becoming increasingly difficult to duplicate onstage, showing their growth as musicians.  They broke barriers and brand new territory with St. Pepper.<br /><br />In the end, this Anthology is the be all and end all of everything the Fab Four and is a must have for any serious fan.  It was refreshing to hear the truth directly from the source.
B00005T30L|3.0|Ghost World is all right.  I do have a few problems with it though, but I'll get to those later.  There are a lot of things I liked like the pair of jeans on the street throughout the movie and it was nice to see a realistic teen of about 18.  Enid and REbecca brought a lot of light to the darker parts of teenhood.  Like feeling misunderstood and acting rebellious to get some attention.  I could really relate to Enid when Rebecca started acting \\"normal\\" and \\"preppy\\" when they promised to generally wreak havoc on the universe.  I could see the confusion in Enid's life as well as Rebecca's.  Enid flt betrayed and very alone in the world, which I can really relate to.  Rebecca felt plain tired of bothering people and wanted to settle down.  <br />Now to the down side of the movie.  I really didn't like it that when they were in the cafe they followed some people because they thought they were Wiccans.  Wiccans don't bother or hurt people ever and they certaintly don't sacrifice virgins.  That's some other group: Satanists.  <br />I could understand why Enid slept with Seymour: because she was confused and felt betrayed by Rebecca and started towards physical gratification because it made her feel better.  I say, that wasn't the best thing to do because it clamped a monkey wrench in her freindship with Seymour.  I thought they didn't need to really show some much of it because then it would have been more siutable for younger viewers.  It's like what the Wiccans say:  having sex with someone takes a lot of responsibility.  Enid didn't have that.  <br />I thought he trip to the \\"XXXXXXX\\" store was kind of unneeded.  But that fit the character of Enid and that's something a girl like Enid would do and made the story more realistic.  But I think they could of found another way to portray Enid because then it would have been a little more suitable for younger veiwers.    <br />All together Ghost World was a good movie with up sides and downsides much like the real life of an eighteen year old girl and I should know too because I am one.<br />Blessed be, eh?
0099416921|5.0|Venetia, the character, is beautiful, strong, smart, capable, honest enough to appreciate her mother's weakness-and adroit enough to use it to her advantage-she isn't 19 years old, but she is properly innocent-to quote the Bible-cautious as serpents but innocent as doves-this type of woman is what we all would like to be.  The stupid quivery bride in April Lady, never commands our respect or our emulation as &quot;our sweet Venetia&quot;.<br />Well done Madam Rougier! C'est magnifique, encore!

B00008US8R|5.0|I saw the video a long time ago yet Bring me to Life stuck with me until in May when I decided that any song that followed me and stuck with me that long has to be worth buying so i bought the cd and now its my 2nd favourite cd ever!<BR>I love Evanescense's mix of piano, guitar, drums and vocals. lyrics are the most important thing in a song according to me and it was as if somebody was telling me a story using the lyrics.<BR>favourite songs of the album: Everybody's Fool, Haunted, Taking Over Me, and Hello.<BR>Evanescense is not Linkin Park. i hate it when people compare bands to other ones because no two bands are alike just as no two people are alike.<BR>I strongly suggest buying this cd.<BR>They played My Immortal at my second cousins funeral.<BR>also where can i buy Origin?
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I am a huge fan, I saw the Matrix 3 times in the movies and bought the DVD the day it came out. I have been waiting 3 years for the sequel as many of you have. Here is the sad fact: If this was the first movie, there would be no sequel. The only reason for this movie is so that the studio can make this a Trilogy (so we can buy a boxed set), it is a franchise just like a Disney movie, complete with action figures and video games.  I hope part 3 ties this all together but my expectations are low. I think the W brothers are great but this movie was 2.5 hours without any memorable dialogue and ridiculous psychobabble as the script. This is not a \\"well its just not as good as the original\\", this is a matter of; it is simply not that good a movie, great action, great cinematography but bad dialogue and plot, that we hope ties together in part 3. Yes it made $280 million dollars, I wish I could much better things about it but I am highly dissappointed.
0449227421|2.0|As a suspense novel, this book is fairly entertaining.  As a primer on genetics or anything scientific, it is fairly useless and inaccurate.  I would give the book 3 stars for its entertainment value, but knock it down to 2 stars, for its many flaws and lapses in logic.<br />The many flaws in this book are pointed out by other reveiwers.  But some of my \\"favorite\\" are:<BR>-just what kind of scientist is the hero?  Is she a geneticist, psychologist or a computer programmer?<BR>-just how many times can the hero be fooled by the bad twin?<BR>-would a police detective really hold off on arresting an arsonist and rapist, just because someone she didn't like asked her to?<BR>-Follett's fixation on women's underwear is just creepy (and I am a guy)<BR>-the whole plan to reveal the badguys at the end of the book is very contrived<BR>-all the badguys are conversatives (opposite of Tom Clancy, whose badguys are all liberals)<br />This book has an interesting premise.  But there is no suspense to it, since it is given away in the title.  The idea of genetically bred, superhuman clones with a violent streak could have been explored a lot more than the superficial treatment given in this book.  We could have seen more action in how they relate to society and each other.<br />But despite all the flaws, I did not hate this book.  It had a pleasant storyline and flow.  The story moved along fairly well.  It was pretty good light summer reading.
B000002KIK|2.0|I often wondered why this album sounded so thin and weak.  I used to think my LP was a bad press, but then years later I bought the remastered import on CD.  It sounded thin and weak, too.  The sound quality for me makes this CD hard to listen to, even though I really like the album content.  I would really like to hear this album not just remastered, but remixed as well.  I doubt that would ever happen.  It was cool to hear Megadeth's version of \\"Never Say Die\\" on the second N.I.B. album because you can get an idea of what the song really should sound like.  It would be awesome to hear of other re-makes of songs on this album.  My personal favorites are \\"Hard Road\\" (which I can listen to over and over) and \\"Shock Wave\\" (Cool riff at the start, and then a very complimentary riff on top of that).  I would love to rate this album higher than 2 stars, but the sound quality is horrible.  One of the worst mixed albums of all time.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Okay, first and foremost I love this movie.  I saw it multiple times and could not wait for its DVD release.  With much anticipation I awaited August 19th to see the DVD unveiled for this 6-Oscar Winning film.  What I found when I put the DVD in my player was nothing short of an eh, so-so effort.  Unlike last years Moulin Rouge DVD or the Harry Potter DVDs, which include two discs, many bonus features, and a ton of other bells and whistles, the Chicago DVD does not even come with nice liner notes! All it has is a sheet of paper with the chapter titles. Believe it or not, the &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; DVD has better liner notes than Chicago's! This DVD's special features are limited - one of them being a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; featurette that has already aired on the Internet months ago.  It seems to me that someone took the easy way out in creating this very limited DVD.  As I stated earlier, the movie is fabulous and it deserves a far better DVD than was produced.   Perhaps the creators of the DVD should take note from a film like Moulin Rouge and give its audience the special features, time, and creativity it deserves.  So in closing, the movie gets a 5, the DVD itself gets a 2.  If you like the movie, go out and buy the DVD - you can expect to be blown away by the film and it's talent.  However, you can also expect to be disappointed at the DVD's lack of ingenuity, effort, and creativity,  which this movie truly deserved more of.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|First I have to confess that I am a die-hard Young fan who has followed his music and career since I first became aware of him during his Springfield days.  I heard mixed reviews and rumbles about this concept album for months.  As usual, it appears that Young has found a path less traveled and walked down it as confidently and competently as he usually does in his best efforts.  I caught his Greendale concert at the Greek in Los Angeles and my first taste of the album was the live performance on opening night.  It was rock-theatre at its best.  He has constructed a rock opera that tells a story as only Young can--no frills rock and roll with succinct lyrics and music that waste no time.  This is not everyone's cup of tea--if mindless r&amp;r are what you are looking for--look elsewhere because you will not find it here.  But that should not be unexpected--the Neil Young I appreciate does not sell his audience short--he challenges them to go one step further and if they make that effort they always find the destination worthwhile.  Greendale is his-story and the kind of album that artists used to make when the record labels were willing to take a risk.  Young probably knows that this music is not for everyone and I am sure he doesn't care.  He has always had integrity and this album is filled with it.  A must for every true Young fan-atic.  Enjoy it.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|If you are a fan of Neil Young, this is definitely one you should pick up.  This is one of his strongest CD's in years.  Simular to \\"Ragged Glory\\" musically.  But in many ways, this is better.  It is actually a novel put to music.  A concept album from Neil Young. Each song is a chapter of a story conceived by one of the greatest singers/songwriters in history.  Back with Crazy Horse, Neil tells a story of a family in Greendale, and instead of lyrics, the liner notes tell portions of the story.  Musically, this is very strong, like some of his great '70's CD's and like mentioned before is also reminicent of his  CD \\"Ragged Glory\\".  Every song is strong, though maybe not \\"hit singles\\", this is classic Neil Young in fine form.  Standout tracks include \\"Bandit\\" which sounds like a Roger Waters solo song, and the almost 13-minute  \\"Grandpa's Interwiew\\".  Also, \\"Sun Green\\" at 12 minutes long is another epic track that isn't likely to be played on the radio.  But that's only because of the length of the song.  It is really a great track.  But as a fan of 70's-style music, I guess I'm a sucker for 10-minute-plus tracks.  \\"Carmichael\\" also clocks in at over 10.  In short, if you like Neil Young, get this, you will not be disappointed.  The included DVD is a bonus, although at this writing, I have not yet viewed it.  But on musical merit alone, this is definitely a \\"must have\\" for any Neil Young fan.
B00009V7T2|5.0|At the Drive-In went prog?  If you were an avid listener of ATDI throughout their run you probably noticed that Relationship of Command was their first album that started shifting from Indie rock to a more experimental fusion of many genres.  And when I heard the band had split into two different camps, I knew TMV was going to be the better half by far.<br />So Tremulant comes and goes, and while it was a brilliant EP, I knew it was just TMV's warm up.  De-loused in the Comatorium confirms that in every way.<br />Containing a sound more akin to Led Zeppelin, Yes, King Crimson, early Santana, and Syd Barret era Pink Floyd mixed together, then the post hardcore of ATDI; it's hard not to label it as a mass fusion of what made the 70's the best period in music history.  But instead of ripping off all of their different influences, the band has created one of the most original styles I've ever heard.<br />The prog/salsa of Drunkship of Lanterns is the best potrayal of the bands sound, a grooving bass line, both trippy and driving guitars, and incredibly tight drumming, not to mention Cedric wailing his lungs out.  Words cannot express just how much Omar and Cedric have both improved.  Omar has become the single most inspiring guitarist since Jimmy Page, and Cedric has changed his vocals from an energetic rap/shout to beautiful wailing that  can only be described as being akin to Robert Plant in his prime.<br />In true prog fashion the album follows the storyline inspired by a childhood friend of Omar and Cedric's, Cerpin Taxt's story is one of sorrow but the music for the most part is incredibly upbeat and lyrically the William Burroughs inspired stories create imagery that brings the songs to life.  <br />It may take a few listens to sink in, but once it does, it'll be the only cd you'll listen to for months.  Easily one of the best albums ever created.
B000092ZYX|5.0|As I wait to go to the show tomorrow at Merriweather Post Pavilion (Columbia, MD), I am amused to read the reviews of people who recommend someone like Justin Timberlake, or any other recording artist (used loosely) over Radiohead.  I'm not going to break down track by track, but I will say that I am 39 years old and I have never heard anything in my life that closely resembles the Radiohead sound.  Your first clue that you are listening to greatness should come when you don't hear these songs on the radio.  I am eclectic in my musical tastes and listen to everything (the spectrum from 50 cent to Chopin) and the creativity in this group is unmatched in anything that is produced today.<br />Do yourself a favor and listen very closely to the harmonics, the beat arrangements, and just the overall strangeness that this album exudes.  Different?  Yes.  If you are looking for something that speaks to you on levels you may not even understand, then buy Hail to the Thief or any other Radiohead production starting with OK Computer.  If you want to hear something different everytime you listen to the album, then buy Radiohead.<br />Turn your radio stations off and listen closely.
0316286850|5.0|Definately Kevyn's most fabulous book, it looks at celebrities and non-celebrities alike and he creates some of the best looks ever that are thoroughly copyable! Definately the most handy book of his to have around! I've ripped off several of these looks several times! Blurs the lines between coffee table book and instructional manual expertly! A true landmark of Kevyn's genious and art!!!
0385504209|3.0|This book was particularly offensive to me as a Christian.  I could not help but wonder if the author is an atheist - or what.  I had to remind myself that this was a book of fiction.  The reference to Jesus being married to Mary Magdeline and having a child was ludicrous.  If Da Vinci was one of the Grand Master's of the secret society, how did he endure the sexual ritual that involved male and female?  And the author's analogy of the church's entrance (can't remember what church) to that of a female vagina with labia and a clitoris was beyond ridiculous.  What is this guy really thinking?  Come on.  Friends of mine recommended the book knowing I am an avid reader.  However, I have read much better.  I am sorry I started the book.  I do finish what I start unless it is totally boring, but I found myself trying to enjoy this book as a work of fiction.  I think too many people will read this book and believe everything the author has to say just because some of his historical references are accurate.
0316286443|4.0|Definately the pinnacle of Kevyn's star-studded career this book is DRIPPING in celebrities from cover to cover! Each super star poses as Kevyn's canvass and boy does he go wild! Highly creative, highly impressive, highly glamorous! The only problem of course being that you would need the face of a celebrity and the talent of Kevyn to pull off most of the looks! But oh well Kevyn showed his own star power in this book before his tragic and too-soon death. He will DEFINATELY be missed by film and fashion elite and by the millions of fans and acolytes he acquired!
6303430570|4.0|This is an indie film (VideoHound gives a $27,575 budget) filmed in not so glorious black and white that is strikingly original, and I mean strikingly, and funny.  Depicting the early twenties slacker set in suburban New Jersey a decade ago, it focuses on convenience store clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), who is adrift in that never-never land between high school and Making Something of Himself.  He still pines for his high school hottie Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer), especially when he learns that his current girl friend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) has, shall we say, had intimate rocket knowledge of thirty-seven different guys, although she had sex with only three of them, including him.  Ah, well, what's a snowball or two between friends?<br />Next door to the convenience store is a video rental store clerked by Dante's best bud, Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson).  Randal scares off the customers, rents his videos elsewhere and just generally slacks off and offends at all times, except when giving career and sexual advice to Dante.  Hanging out outside and dealing are Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).  Kevin Smith also directed and wrote the script and probably did the catering and clean up as well.  He is one very clever and talented dude who told it like it almost was while mildly satirizing the New Jersey denizens and the slacker mentality, but with affection and a kind of light-hearted aplomb.<br />There's some absurdity, Caitlin making love to a dead man and not realizing he's dead, the guys playing stick ball hockey on the roof of the convenience store, Randal selling cigs to a four-year-old who lights up, etc., mixed with the pathos of making minimum wage and going nowhere, and some sight gags and a whole lot of spiffy, crude, and dead-panned one-liners.  Nothing is taken too seriously, including Kevin Smith and his film, so that when they run the final credits we are pleased with this slice of indeterminate life in the Garden State.<br />I was reminded of some other low budget films made about the same time including Bang (1995), Floundering (1994) and The Unbelievable Truth (1990), especially the latter, but none are as outrageously funny as Clerks.  Incidentally, this is currently ranked in IMDb's Top 250.I was reminded of some other low budget films made about the same time including Bang (1995), Floundering (1994) and The Unbelievable Truth (1990), especially the latter, but none are as outrageously funny as Clerks.

0671027344|5.0|I loved this book. And its not even the kind of book I normally find myself reading. But my friend recommended it and said that everyone she ever recommended it to loved it and I can see why!<br />Its just plain honest and open and supremely endearing! The main character is geeky but lovable and no matter who you are you will end up identifying with him by the end! Though the book is mostly about his struggles its far from depressing. You really want this kid to succeed and you really do end up seeing parts of your own successes and failures in his story. Its just a darling, precious story!
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Allright. By now you either get Neil Young or you don't and time should not be wasted trying to bring new converts to the fold.  This is an ambitious,sprawling effort that misfires at certain points, but overall it works for me.   The songs are spare, to be sure, but convey an earnestness and freshness lacking in most overproduced fare. You get the sense that this was a one take recording which sounds live and vibrant. The cd builds narratively and musically to a powerful conclusion, despite the muddled storyline. I would liken it to a stripped down \\"Ragged Glory\\", with a more consistent musical theme. <br />The bonus dvd is a treasure and is worth the purchase in its own right.  It was featured on the Neil's website last month. The liner notes indicate that Pancho was not part of the studio mix, which accounts for his nominal contribution on tour.   To conclude, buy it, get in the car, crank it up and go for a long drive.
0312305060|4.0|So, I went to see the movie when it first came out because of all the hype and high praise surrounding it. But I came away from it like, &quot;Wha...? Either that was a terrible movie or I'm missing something major here!&quot;<br />What I was missing was the book!<br />The inner dialogue of these characters is the driving force of the book and even actresses of the caliber in the movie couldn't convey the spectacular journeys of the psyche these women went on.<br />I've read all of Michael's other books and I think this really is his crown jewel. I think the characters are utterly delicious and the story is thoroughly thought-provoking without giving you a migraine. In short I'm very happy I read the book!
B000001FG5|5.0|I bought an LP copy of this album in 1979,the year it was released. I first heard TRAGEDY playing on my cousin's phonograph. In 1979,disco was still healthy and strong. TOO MUCH HEAVEN was released as a single in late 1978,prior to the release of the SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN. This is the Bee Gees' first album of their own since their now-deceased brother Andy's career took off. Andy had two albums prior to this one and following the Bee Gees' CHILDREN OF THE WORLD album. Other hit songs from this album include LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT and the title track. We take notice on this album that only Barry Gibb's vocals are heard. Robin Gibb did not at all,at least,take any lead vocals. Like MAIN COURSE and CHILDREN OF THE WORLD,SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN contains several disco tunes. The second album with the Boneroo Horns,they play wonderfully on STOP(THINK AGAIN),SEARCH FIND,LIVING TOGETHER and I'M SATISFIED. STOP was recorded in jazz style. The album closes with UNTIL,the &quot;cool-down&quot; track. After this album,Barry would work with Barbra Streisand on her GUILTY album.

B000001FAW|5.0|This album is a second volume of the Bee Gees' disco. YOU SHOULD BE DANCING opens this album also being the first single. It would later be used for the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER movie soundtrack album and heard in the film. This album has more disco than MAIN COURSE. Other disco tunes include YOU STEPPED INTO MY LIFE,CAN'T KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN,BOOGIE CHILD and SUBWAY. All three Bee Gees sport aviation pilot jackets on the cover and each with their names on them. After the release of this album,the Bee Gees would tour and record HERE AT LAST BEE GEES LIVE. Other hit songs include the title track,LOVE SO RIGHT and LOVE ME. This is the first album to feature the band's employed brass ensemble,The Boneroo Horns. The Boneroo Horns would work with the Bee Gees through the mid-eighties.
6304711875|5.0|SCREAM is not only the best horror movie, but the best movie ever! It is filled with wit, shocks, scares, and humor. These fine qualities are all blended flawlessly together to form a masterpiece! From a lot of other reviews I've read, people think this movie is merely a satire of horror movie cliques and is not scary. Well, I'll tell you, it is VERY SCARY! Yes, there are satire, but it is so clever and makes the movie more enjoyable!  Stunning performance from Neve Campbell. She portrays Sidney, the protaginist, and does a spectacular job of making her seem relatable, likeable, and more! Skeet Ulrich is perfect! His acting abilities are astonishing and his looks are wonderful. ;) Many other impeccable performances from Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Drew Barrymore, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and Rose McGowan. Not only was it filled with great acting, but the screenplay was exceptional! The plot was excellent and the ending had an exceedingly clever twist. Kevin Williamson did a superlative job! And Wes Craven did a tremendously fine job directing this work of art. Before I didnt like scary movies. But when I saw SCREAM, my whole view on the horror genre changed! Now I am a huge fan of thrillers! So to those horror fanatics and those who, like me before, don't like scary movies, I reccomend this movie to everyone! Go buy it! It'll be definitly worth it!!!
B000001FNL|5.0|Here are the Bee Gees in the era of disco with some disco of their own. The first single JIVE TALKIN' probably had discotheques increasing business. I had the 45 RPM single JIVE TALKIN' with WIND OF CHANGE on the flip side when I was a child. In fact,it was the first record I ever owned. I was four years old when those songs were on the charts. Another disco song is NIGHTS ON BROADWAY which opens this album. JIVE TALKIN' was the Bee Gees' first major hit since RUN TO ME in 1972. COUNTRY LANES has Robin Gibb's warbling voice and on some other songs,Barry Gibb's falsetto debut. COME ON OVER was a hit for Olivia Newton-John. This album was a million-seller,probably more,according to many sources.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Undeniably Radiohead is one of the most innovative and interestings bands around.  But they seem to get more and more slack and self-satisfied -- almost smug -- with each record.  Here a few good tunes, particularly the opening and closing tracks, get lost in a smorgasboard of mediocre music, unintelligible lyrics, and excessive production.  Back to the Bends please!

B00005JKN9|1.0|The best part of this movie was over after the first ten minutes. If you should feel compelled to ever view this exceedingly uncessesary film, then as soon as Liam Neeson dies, by all means turn it off! You have officially seen the only good part of this entire movie.<br />Now I know all you Martin Scorsese fans out there are going to reach for the \\"this review was not helpful to me in any way and in fact I hope lighting strikes the unintelligent reviewer\\" button right about now, but hear me out.<br />I like Martin Scorsese too. He is a genius. So is Daniel Day-Lewis, who redeems several entire minutes of this flop. However, Daniel Day-Lewis is only one guy, and, let's face it, Martin Scorsese is not who you're looking at on screen. (Well, except for his pretentious two and a half second long cameo, but why split hairs?)<br />Who you ARE looking at on screen is Leonardo DiCaprio, hopelessly miscast and sporting an on-again-off-again possibly Irish accent and seeking to avenge his father's death. Of course, the length of this movie should be an indication that DiCaprio's indecision with HOW to avenge his father rivals that of Hamlet, and the audience is meanwhile suffering through endless dialogue-- none of which is Shakespeare. Or even close.<br />So here you have it. A very (very, very) convoluted plot that meanders so far from what appeared to be the point three hours ago, that by the time the end of the movie finally arrives you barely have the energy to care anymore. Also, intensely gratuitous violence that even for brawling street gangs of the 19th century appears a little unncessesary. <br />I actually saw this in the movie theater and it is the only movie I've ever seen in theaters that I felt like walking out of: not in outrage or righteous indignation, oh no... but most certainly out of sheer boredom.<br />Save your money and let's hope that Scorsese's next epic will be less Cecil B. DeMille and more George Cukor. More wit and originality and less banal bloodshed.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Approaching the release date of Linkin Park's sophomore album I'll admit a die-hard fan such as me even had my doubts about repeating the spectacular debut in Hybrid Theory and the success it became.  It earned them many more fans and introduced a unique style in which they blend a touch of hip-hop with hard rock.  But I was surprised when I first heard this album of just how amazing this band really is.  In my opinion, it not only equaled Hybrid, but is better.  They have become more mature lyrically and all songs are held with deep meaning within those words that people can really relate to with songs such as Easier to Run and Numb.  Just like Hybrid Theory, there isn't a bad song on the album.  <br />1. Foreword:  Only 13 seconds of pounding to introduce the album's first song \\"Don't Stay\\"<br />2. Don't Stay: This is a great hard rock song that'll get your adrenaline pumping rite off the bat.  The bass in this song is probably the most intense and best in any LP song.  9/10<br />3. Somewhere I Belong: First single off Meteora, has that very much \\"Linkin Park\\" sound to it and is about finding yourself in life. Great song to kick off the new album. 10/10<br />4. Lying From You: First taste of the hip-hop rock genre fans are used to seeing from LP.  Again, they do it rite and the song comes out really good.  9/10<br />5. Hit the Floor: Kinda song you wouldn't ever expect, with hip-hop verses and a slamming hard rock chorus filled with intense screaming to the core.  It's decent but there are much better songs. 7/10<br />6. Easier To Run: In my opinion, this is one of the most powerful songs lyrically on Meteora.  I can't describe it, you need to hear it to get the real feeling but it's about escaping pain from your past and how to deal with it.  9/10<br />7. Faint: Second single which starts off with some strings that  work great with the song.  I love the chorus in this which climaxes at the bridge where Chester gets into some more of his heavy yelling.  I would say probably the most popular song on the cd...and for good reason. 10/10<br />8. Figure.09: More hip-hop verses with singing chorus with rock music as the background.  Nothing more to say about it except it comes out awesome. 9/10<br />9. Breaking the Habit: Just for those of you who don't know..6 years in the making for the finished product of this song. The vocals are unbelievable that are sang by Chester with the deep meaningful lyrics written by Mike about turning your life around by breaking a serious habit someone has.  All this to a tune of a some-16 piece live orchestra featuring a piano and strings.  Very unique song, most people appreciate it. 8/10<br />10. From the Inside: Excellent keyboarding by Joe Hahn starts off the song about being lied to and not being able to trust anyone after being deceived.  Song progessively gets into more yelling as it goes on with a concluding repeated, \\"I won't trust myself with you!!\\" 9/10<br />11. Nobody's Listening: Song is different from the rest of this album.  This proves LP is into trying new things, as this track features a rare japenese flute as it's background beat to compliment Mike's dark rhymes about pain. 8/10<br />12. Session: Cure for the Itch Part 2...Hahn once again goes to work on those turntables and creates a sick track just like on Hybrid. <br />13. Numb: The final track on Meteora reaches back to the rock feeling, only this is a deep song with a slower style. Absolutely impossible not to like, it's my favorite Linkin Park song.  It relates to the idea of when your little people envision you as what they want you to become in life and to meet their expectations of you. So it's about finding your own self of what you want to become. The bridge in this song is outstanding, it gives me goosebumps when I hear it.  11/10
6305180261|5.0|This is a great video from my favorite band of all time.  I would love to have it on DVD.  Hopefully when they do release it on DVD it will include &quot;You could be mine.&quot;  Please! Please! Please! release it on DVD!!!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil Young has produced an incredible work of art with his cycle of songs about the people in the fictional town of Greendale. The CD features Young and Crazy Horse doing what they do best: rocking out to the beat of some of Neil's well-wrought character-filled tunes. If I were rating the music alone, I'd probably only give it  4 stars, but the performance on the DVD merits 5 stars. The DVD is an excellent recording of Neil's solo acoustic performance of all the &quot;Greendale&quot; songs with the bonus of hearing his stories about the characters and the town in between the songs. His playing and singing are superb and the stories really flesh out the whole thing, making it an extremely rewarding listening experience. Overall, I think this is a remarkable achievement for someone who has been around the block but continues to stretch himself artistically. Thanks, Neil for keeping us on our toes!
0425188809|5.0|Dean really pulled out all the stops in this one.  This book has every genre: horror, science fiction, humor, mystery, political thriller, romance, social satire, etc.  And, somehow he makes it all work in a way no one else has ever duplicated.  The book is so much better than the pathetic Watchers movies Hollywood churned out in the 80s.  They all took elements of the original book, but, none of them followed the plot very closely.  <BR>The author took the idea of a genetically altered golden retreiver, named Einstein by the lead charactor, and ran with it.  He threw in an incredibly repugnant creature, also genetically altered, a hero with a suspicious past, and had them all being pursued by an implacable government agent and his agency.  The result is one of the most exciting, thrill rides imaginable.  It is also hysterically funny in an intelligent and thoughtfull way.  This book put Dean at the very top of horror writers, as well as creating his own genre that combined all the elements of all the other genres in a Mainstream style.  Don't miss this one!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Wonderful melange of previous Radiohead styles.  I loved Kid A and, to a lesser extent, Amnesiac, but I'm glad to hear Bends/OK Computer hooks and themes.  I thought at first there was a distinct lack of experimentation in this record, which disappointed me.  But after repeated listens the album has really grown on me.  Hail is every bit as much a process of Radiohead continuing to expand and solidify their conception of themselves and our conception of them as a band.  Instead of trying to reinvent themselves by sounding different (but still Radiohead), they now sound more like Radiohead (but still different).  <br />Thom Yorke mutters darkly over Autechre-like electronic skittishness in several tracks (Gloaming...), but also gets  funky in others (Drunken Punch Up...).  And there are guitar riffs on this album!  Actual playing!  Ok, there was actual playing (and guitar) on Kid A, too, but it sounded so alien at times, so depressed and full of pre- and post-millenial tension (which I love), that I often missed the band that could evoke strong emotions with a nice guitar line and well-chosen lyrics a la the Bends, without the need to continuously disorient me and demonstrate how alienated we all are in this post-post-postmodern world (I would add more &quot;posts&quot;, but we may have an infinite regress.  Is that the point of Kid A?)<br />So this album is nice.  If you like Radiohead and haven't purchased it yet (which I doubt), do it now.  Even if you are poor and can't afford it.  Your kids don't have to eat -every- day.  If you aren't familiar with the Radiohead oevre (read: live in the mountains in a 1-room shack, in which case you won't be reading this anyway), this isn't a bad place to start, as it'll give you a better idea of all the places they've been than any other single album.  However, I'd still recommend the Bends or OK Computer first, just because they're my favorites.<br />P.S. If you find yourself getting upset reading this because you have radically different opinions about Radiohead, maybe you should consider moving to a 1-room cabin in the mountains and cooling off for a few years.
0553573403|5.0|This is probably the best fantasy work I've read after Tolkien. It's a real page-turner, whose enchanting setting, rich characters and complex plot structures construct a powerful and intense reading you just can't put away until you've read every single word of it.<br />Martin creates a world utterly believable with characters so complex and yet so understandable, so the audience can easily relate to them. The unusual structure the author has chosen only enhances the complexity and increases the appeal of the book. With each chapter being told from a different point of view, the reader is given an opportunity to explore the main characters and reach into their deepest feelings, thoughts, desires, the goals they have and the decisions they make.<br />The imaginary world is masterfully developed, with magic and magical creatures being alloted just the right amount of space to keep the flame of anxiety burning. Yet, it is the characters and their actions that account for most of the suspence in this book. In an complex blend of mystery, plots and counterplots, passions and cruelty, honor and betrayal, battles and intrugues, the fates of three noble families are intricately interwooven and the prospects are utterly bleak. A deeply compelling and extremely readable work, _A Game of Thrones_ will most likely leave you confused, perhaps because it doens't have the convenitonal ending. In fact, it doesn't seem to have an ending at all, only an open epic struggle against everythung and everybody. I can't promise you'll like this book; what I can promise, though, is that it'll leave you with an avalanche of powerful emotions. You can love, hate, cry or reason with the characters, be devastated, disappointed and secretly gloat, but one thing is sure: you will not be left indifferent. I will definitely, definitely read the sequels. Great work!
0062502182|5.0|A children's book?  Well, if that's what this is, then I have no problem letting out the child inside of me. I've read this book at least 5 times, and every time, I get something new out of it.  Simple or unoriginal? Perhaps for those more &quot;learned&quot; readers, but for a myself and for everyone to whom I've passed it on, it's been a wonderful, enlightening journey with Santiago.  <br />It's a great book to read at a time of uncertainty in your life. It can apply to many areas: love, friendship, jobs, family, travelling, etc..  It's enchanting, charming, entertaining, and as deep as you want it to be. <br />I teach high school English, and I can't name one of my students who has read it and not enjoyed it. Some of them have even said it changed their life or the way they think. So, 3rd grade, I doubt it, but it's a great read for any age. It just might change your life. And if it doesn't, it's a good story anyway. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a gorgeous movie. The costumes, cinematography, and art direction are spectacular and unlike anything since Cabaret.<br />Watch out for Nicole Kidman's sizzling performance as Satine. For the first half of the movie we see a person who is not ultimately rude or shallow, but a rather desperate woman who pretends she doesn't care and is just trying to live her life the way she's told. For the second half of the movie, we see an amazingly emotional, dramatic woman who is deeply in love and doesn't even know how to express herself. In Nicole's eyes we see the desperation and depression and the crying out for help. If only we could leap into our televisions and save her from pain, emotionally, physically, and mentally. In any other year, when Halle Berry's breathtaking work in Monster's Ball hadn't been nominated, Nicole would have won the Oscar.<br />I can't begin to describe Moulin Rouge. The whole thing is a gorgeous, dazzling drama turned into an electrifying cabaret. Ultimately though, this film is honestly about truth, beauty, freedom, and love. But they left one thing out- this movie is about sadness and the overcoming of sadness. If he ever could overcome it after the tragic ending.
B00005JMC6|5.0|This movie is so amazing that I watched it two weekends in a row to make sure I did not miss anything. I took a towel the second time because kleenex were not enough. The movie takes place in New Zealand in the Maori Indian culture. Pi's grandfaher is awaiting the birth of his grandson so he can lead his people once again, like the legend of the Whale Rider led thier people to New Zealand. The child was born dead and thus only his twin sister survived, and, in her grandfather's eyes could never be the leader that the Maori People needed. The young girl loved her grandfather, and her heritage, and forgave his narrow mindedness because she understood his frustrations and wishes she could be the grandon he wanted. The girl ( Keisha Cstle-Hugess ) gives the most touching performance I have ever seen, worthy of an Oscar nomination. Also, the scenery is beautiful and witnessing some Maori dances customs was an added bonus. Great for a family or a date!
B00005U11Z|5.0|...this DVD is an incredible work of art. The sound and picture quality are outstanding. The group is at their very best in this DVD.  Steve Augeri sings all of the songs with heart and soul. Deen Castronovo rips the drums apart and to top it off he sings! Listen to the duet between Deen and Steve on Higher Place. It will blow you away...
B0000AI44Q|5.0|With several songs topping 10 minutes and several nearly 13 minutes long, this release is Neil's best in many years. The lyrics are clever and poignant, and the band (Crazy Horse) sets the pace for Neil's folksy/rock songs better than anyone else can do. This package of DVD/CD combo is a great buy, with the CD coming in at 78 minutes and the DVD including the entire rock opera of Greendale. What are you waiting for? Get this one fast!!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is perfect if u liked the movie like i did. If you listen to the songs and close your eyes you can use your imagination and watch the movie over and over agian!! The music is very relaxing and fun to listen to. Oh and if you haven't seen the movie yet....go now!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|I ain't even messing around on this... this album is increadable... if anyone out there has any doubts at all about it, put them to rest... everything about this is the work of a genius... enought said, now go buy it...
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This is a deep, introspective, and complex movie.  Most people I've encountered who 'hate it' or think it's stupid can't begin to scratch past the surface of the special effects.  It's better to admit that your just don't understand the movie and move on rather than reveal yourself to be an idiot.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|For years Neil Young has proven that he is a visionary with the heartbeat of a true and pure artist.  This album and accompanying DVD is yet another brilliant beat on his artistic drum.
B000069AUI|5.0|One of my favorite cd's of 2002. The band are great musicians and songwriters. It kind of sounds like a cross between Pink Floyd, U2 and Radiohead. If you are looking for something kind of mellow without going to adult contemporary than this is the cd for you.
0676973779|5.0|i read such negative reviews of this book that when my 'hold' came in at the library; i just returned it. Later, a co-worker read it and loved it's message about the huge question \\"is there a god?\\" <br />i thought the book was about boy and talking animals in a boat..WRONG! On this woman's recommendation; i acually bought the book and was totally delighted. <br />The 13 year boy decides he wants to be a hindu, catholic and jew and loves all aspects of the religions. It comes so natural in his way of viewing things...then he bumps into all the priests (rabi, ec.) and they start fighting amoungst themselves that the boy cannot be all three.<br />It is the total innocence and acceptance and wisdom of the boy that is the foundation of this book. <br />During his families move to America, he is the only one saved with a begal tiger and several animals. It's his will to survive and knowledge how animals react (his father ran a zoo in india) and his need to keep the tiger alive (for his sanity of being alone at sea) without being killed himself. <br />There is no communication with any animal except in nature's way.<br />This is a little gem of a book and one i lend to everyone and later discuss.
B000002UJQ|1.0|First, you can't understand a word Thom Yorke says and second the songs are not memorable at all. I am an avid music lover and I think that everybody is rating this record good because the so called &quot;music critics&quot; say its good.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|\\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\\" is one of the best soundtracks I've come across in quite some time.  It is an exciting, amusing, and highly enjoyable listen.  From the almost Celtic theme on \\"Fog Bound\\" and \\"Walk the Plank\\" to the classic action theme on tracks like \\"Bootstrap's Bootstraps\\"and \\"He's a Pirate\\" to the 'bad pirate' theme on \\"Swords Crossed\\", musically it delivers on all levels.  The music is a lot of fun to hum along with, which I tend to look for in a soundtrack.<br />This was my first experience with Klaus Badelt's work, and while Hans Zimmer's influence is obvious to anyone familiar with the \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\" soundtracks,  he seems to be a rising star in the world of movie music.  I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another of his soundtracks in the future.<br />My one complaint about this CD has nothing to do with the music itself but rather with its length.  It is fairly short as far as soundtracks go, clocking in at 43:37.  I prefer the 60+ min. ones, especially when accompanying a movie, like \\"Pirates,\\" that is longer than 2 hours.  However, the shortness of the disc does not detract significantly, which is why I give it an enthusiastic 4.5 stars!<br />Standout Tracks:<BR>\\"The Medallion Calls\\"~  Very upbeat, I can so see Jack sailing in on his sinking ship!<BR>\\"Swords Crossed\\"~ The deliciously creepy theme played on the Black Pearl while Elizabeth is harassed by the skeletal pirates<br />\\"Barbossa is Hungry\\"~ My favorite track, very exciting, great percussion<BR>\\"Skull and Crossbones\\"~ The essence of the pirate/action theme<br />Bottom Line:  A solid investment to be enjoyed again and again!
0783225970|5.0|great job in getting it to me fast!!!!  thanks!!!
B00001PE4D|5.0|How many times has \\"Cruel Intentions\\" been around yet? Four times? Usually, classic novels dont get any better the more often you make a movie out of it. Not this time...this movie is just great. Its fast-paced, funny, sexy and- most of all- very romantic. The characters are extremely well drawn and never annoying (especially Sebastian Valmont is simply great...you hate him, but you love him...at the same time). You actually never get bored by this vehicle, as the time goes by as fast as a ride in a 1956 Jaguar. By the, way, ALL of the actors do agreat job, though most of them are pretty new in the business. Thumbs up for that one!
B00005JLSE|5.0|ok, if you guys love fosse's stuff, your gonna love this one! while i belive marsall takes the credit for the dancing, fosse is all over this one. the movie \\"all that jazz\\" has been a favorite of mine since it came out (way back when), which has just been released on DVD (about time) i'm waiting for my copy to arrive any day now! i'm glad mr. marshall stayed \\"true\\" to bob. as a former high school drama teacher, i must admit, i got teary eyed with the opening number, as one of my students did it for a contest those many years ago. anyway, this movie \\"kick's ...\\" if i may use a term from the corp...if your looking for entertainment this is the one for you, if you like dancing......get this one..to bad mike douglas found her 1st, jones is the hottest babe on the planet. if your like the other guy( above review) looking for \\"social issues\\" about \\"bad\\" vs \\"evil\\", go look at disney. i enjoyed this one. the bad \\"girls\\" got off!!!!!! i loved that part.....oh by the richard gere, can sing and dance.....totallllllly, to cool.....
0345350499|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley takes the reigns with contemporary Arthurian retellings using Morgaine, a female protagonist in this widely circulated book 'The Mists Of Avalon.'  Throughout history, poets and authors alike have added their spin on the popular legend, ranging from Geoffrey of Monmouth, Thomas Malory to Mary Stewart and now Miss Bradley.  Her talent of writ never wavers as the book progresses, and though the pages are large and numerous and the script small, one hardly takes notice as you become spellbound by her literary prowess.   And like any accomplished Author, her resources are liberally extended, including ancient pre-Augustine christian manuscripts, Volumes of English mythology, to various covens rooted in traditional English heathenism...The Mists Of Avalon will rest comfortably atop my living room coffee table.  If you don't mind looking through the soul of a woman who Marion Zimmer Bradley sees as criminalized in legend, I doubt you will find any fault with this book.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|The Greendale live performance blew me away and so does this cd.  This is Neil and Crazy Horse at their best - loose garage grungy jams with classic Neil guitar hooks and a message.  Don't let the 'concept' scare you off.  Understanding the story is not necessary to enjoy the music, but the social commentary is right on.<br />The best is the amazingly coincidental lyrics in Sun Green talking about the government causing an unpredicted blackout - and this cd coming out just days after the East Coast real life blackout.  Pretty wild.<br />The guitar solos and jams are just kick ass.
B00009V7T2|5.0|One of the best albums I have heard in the longest time.  This is innovative music that breaks through structures of writing -- Omar is an amazing writer, Cedric's range is incredible.  Flea's touch of bass only adds the icing to the cake.  Awesome drumming, awesome timing, and great composing.  Nothing like layered music for the listener to deconstruct.  Prog rock, rock, and popular music in general are lucky to have this band.  Can't wait to see what these guys will do next, but then again by the time we catch up, they'll probably have disbanded TMV and moved on to another project to break through some more lines.
B000002KDO|4.0|For awhile, I thought this album was their best. That was until I got the 1st album. And while this album isn't their best, it certainly beats Paranoid in terms of heavier songs and production. <br />This is pretty much the same stuff you'd expect from Sabbath, but some classics are on this that have to be mentioned at least once about Sabbath. Children Of The Grave, Sweet Leaf, and Into The Void are some of my absoulte favorite Black Sabbath tunes, and this album is also the start of the brief-but-lovely acoustic instrumentals (Orchid, Embryo). Also, this album has something rare from Black Sabbath: a GOOD ballad. (Let's not mention Changes.)So, this is a very good, yet unbelievalby short album from Black Sabbath. Defiently worth it.
B00005JM02|5.0|Our family loves Pixar movies.  These days, when even Disney movies have questionable things in them, every Pixar movie so far has been great.  \\"Nemo\\" is an all-around great movie, but our very favorite part of it is the portrayal of Marlin, Nemo's dad.  Dads are rarely portrayed in movies as loving, responsible, etc. if they're even present at all (there's no dad in the \\"Toy Story\\" movies, for example).  \\"Nemo\\" is a terrific portrayal of a single dad who's single for an acceptable reason (widower, not divorced or never married) who loves his child, takes responsibility for him, and is totally devoted to him.  Even if the rest of the movie weren't so good, I would recommend it solely on the basis of this aspect of the movie.  We rarely go out to the movies, but we took our kids to see this one twice in the first month it was out!
B000002KE2|5.0|It's so impressive that Black Sabbath, with one 40 minute album, would set the stage for stoner metal and goth. This is one of their finest moments. There are barely any bad songs on here. The playing is fantastic, the songwriting is topnotch, and the production is almost as good as the first album (which I absolutely love!)<br />The album starts with Wheels Of Confusion, a slow one-chord song with a few tempo changes. I love the guitar and piano intro. Tomorrow's Dream is a straightforward rock song that doesn't sound really evil. Changes, however, [is really bad]. FX is interesting for a while, but Supernaut gets things going after 5 minutes of dullness. This is the best track from the album with a rare Bill Ward drum solo. Possibly one of the greatest songs of all time.<br />Side 2 starts out great with the slow dreamy Snowblind. Coruncopia is another doomy song with A LOT OF TEMPO CHANGES. Laguna Sunrise is a pretty song with some good acoustic guitarby Tony, then St. Vitus Dance comes in. It's...ok. Weird for a Sabbath tune. Then the ultimate classic, Under The Sun. Some of the best riffing i've ever heard, and an infectious ending. Perfect album, despite a few flaws.
B000001ELP|4.0|The concept album pushed by the record company onto KISS. It was a part of a trilogy that died with this first album.  A good deal of the songs are all orchestrated (I must say better than their newer album the Symphony Alive IV) and it is a definite gamble for KISS to release an album like this.  Even though this album was a commercial disaster (one of the KISS albums never to go gold) it has remained stubbornly today in print.  It could be because of &quot;A world without Heroes&quot; and I few good songs such as &quot;I&quot; proceed.  I wouldnt buy it new, buy it at a used price.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Black Sabbath, to me, are one of the most influential groups I've ever heard. They have certainly influenced my guitar playing and sound. Unfortuantly, their legacy didn't last long, and this, their 6th album, is the last good one. The painfully dull albums that came out in 1976 and 1978 (Technical Ecstacy, Never Say Die) suck, and don't get me started on the Dio-Gillian-Martin-I don't know how many lineup changes-days of the band. Ugh.<br />Anyway, every song, minus 1, is excellent. Hole In The Sky is a great aggresive opener, followed immedialty with the calm Don't Start (Too Late). Then, the birth of thrash metal begins. Symptom of The Universe is in my mind, the song that started Metallica. It's a great song. Megalomania is another brilliant epic, with a very VERY cool ending. The Thrill of It All is a great lost gem that gets a little happy near the end. Supertzar sucks because it doesn't really start AT ALL. A 3-and-a-half minute intro to a non-existant song sucks, if you ask me. Am I Going Insane? is a very strange song with some horrific laughing and screaming near the end. <br />Then there's the best song, The Writ.<br />This song kicks ass! The riffs are awesome, the singing's top notch, the structure of the song rules, and the ending is extremely catchy and very cool sounding. A perfect ender for an album and a career. Get this album!
0064400557|5.0|A favorite of mine since I was a kid.  Charlotte the spider and the other animals in the farm do the best to save Wilbur the pig from the axe...a young girl hears what the animals are saying and along with the strange happenings at the farm (concerning Wilbur) it makes for a good book.  Pass it on to your kids.
B000002KET|4.0|After the great Vol. 4, I knew that Black Sabbath couldn't quite get up to expectations for the next album. And although this album is good, there are a fow songs I could live without.<br />One thing I have to say is that Rick Wickman was both a bless and a curse for this band. He performed and really helped on some great tracks (Sabbra Cadabra), but also played on absolute ...(Who Are You).<br />That said, there are some good songs, like the title song, National Acrobat, Killing Yourself to Live, and Fluff. However, there are some really pretensious songs that are just out of place, like Who Are You? The song's synthizisers are enough to drive one crazy. Also, Looking For Today is just bland. It feels like a throwayay. And Spiral Architect, despite having a great intro, sounds too 70's arena rock to me, especially when the band kicks in. <br />All in all, it's a decent album. Nothing too great, however.
0385504209|5.0|I started reading this while killing an hour before going to a Fourth of July BBQ. Well, an hour later I could not put it down... missed the BBQ, fireworks, and my beauty sleep as I stayed up until 4 AM when I finished this marvelous tale. I immediately picked up Dan Brown's \\"prequel\\" of sorts, Angels and Demons, and spent the next day reading that. Dan Brown has put a huge dent in my social life this last weekend but it was worth it all. Can't wait for the next book!<br />I would like to recommend another terrific book, a murder mystery by William Freeman, MURDER IN KEY WEST... terrific story, great sex, beautiful locale.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first saw the cd in a music store.  The first thing that caught my attention was the name of the band because it was a weird name and I didn't know what it means.  I just left the cd alone.  After a couple of months, I was channel surfing and I stopped on MTV.  I saw \\"Bring me to life\\".  I really liked the song and I wanted to hear it again.  I bought \\"Fallen\\" after one week and after listening to it, Evanescence instantly became my favorite band.  Their music is different from most music that you hear these days.  The lyrics in their music are very meaningful.  Amy Lee is an amazing vocalist.  Her voice is haunting and very beautiful.  Honestly, I can't say that she has the best voice that I've ever heard but there is something about the way that she sings.  She is very expressive in her singing.  This is the only cd that I can listen to from beginning to end without skipping any of the tracks.  I was able to buy the cd.  If it was worth twice or even thrice the amount, I would still buy it because it is that good.  I only wish I could give it more stars.  <br />Fave song: Bring me to life, My immortal, Tourniquet<BR>Least Fave: none
B00009W0U4|3.0|I agree with most previous comments on the film.<br />Title sequences and menus are very memorable, as is the soundtrack.<br />As mentioned by some on Netflix, the technical transfer of this film renders a poor image on some systems.  Much of the action takes place at night, and there is alot of interference.  perhaps the worse I've seen.  Not unwatchable, but it may handicap the movie.  Consider renting first...
0738206679|5.0|In my opinion, Barabasi's book is a decent addition to the existing books on complexity and networks. The author himself is an acknowledged authority of the field of networks. I disagree with some previous critiques that suggest that the book is empty.  The book in fact covers a lot of material with just enough technical detail that a layman can understand. The author is able to explain well how various networks form, work, how they fail etc., bringing examples from a wide variety of fields. The text itself is easily readable and provides the reader a good and intuitive understanding of networks without essentially resorting to the language of mathematics which is exactly what Richard Feynman does in his famous book &quot;The character of physical law&quot;. If anybody tried to do this, this is not at all an easy task and hence I consider it a nice achievement. Just to mention one particular example, I have not seen such a crystal clear explanation of the strange and somewhat mystic &quot;power law&quot; distribution that shows up in virtually all complex systems and which most books fail to communicate to the public. So if you are looking for an entertaining book which also provides a good and easy introduction into networks at work, you should read it.
B0000AI44Q|2.0|Like many other Neil/Crazy Horse fans, I heard this album performed live, long before its release.  I saw them live several months ago, and was quite enthused over the prospect of hearing the new album previewed in concert.  Unfortunately, what I heard that night was a bunch of bloated, uninspired (musically and lyrically - I honestly cannot remember the last time I heard a Neil Young effort for the first time and didn't come away with a memorable tune, hook, riff, or lyrics ringing in my head afterwards - didn't happen this time!), and, for the most part, boring songs.  Admittedly, I felt that the bad high school play going on behind the band on stage may have detracted from the music.  However, after hearing the actual CD (Yes, I did buy it -such is my devotion to Neil and Crazy Horse), I believe my initial reaction above was justified.  Recommended only for die-hard NY/CH fans who truly believe they can do no wrong whatsoever.  For me - it's just not one of their better efforts.
B000059TPN|5.0|Academy Award winners Sean Connery (The Untouchables) and Nicolas Cage (Leaving Las Vegas) face incredible odds in the 1996 action-packed hit \\"The Rock\\". Rogue US general Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) and his team seized control of Alcatraz Island and threaten the population of San Francisco with poison gas rockets. Now the lives of millions rest in the hands of a FBI chemical weapons specialist (Nicolas Cage) and a former Alcatraz escapee (Sean Connery). \\"The Rock\\" is a thrilling edge-of-your-seat spectacle from start to finish. Director Michael Bay has gain success with such blockbuster films as \\"Armageddon\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\" but \\"The Rock\\" still remains as the director's finest work. The plot is well paced with some nice twists. Director Michael Bay stages some amazing action sequences including a fierce car chase within the streets of San Francisco. Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage have great onscreen chemistry and further drive the film's story. The cast also includes John Spencer, David Morse, William Forsythe, Michael Biehn and Vanessa Marcil.<br /><br />If you weren't impressed with the previous release then upgrade to \\"The Rock\\" Criterion Collection. The 1996 action-packed hit is presented in an enhanced 2.35:1 widescreen format. The DVD contains a stunning and flawless picture quality with vibrant color and sharpness. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is certainly impressive and offers more aggressive surround effects than the DTS audio track. This 2-Disc Criterion Edition features audio commentaries by cast and crew, four behind-the-scenes and special effects featurettes, picture gallery, outtakes, original theatrical trailer, TV spots and the movie's premiere on Alcatraz. \\"The Rock\\" is non-stop fun and this Criterion Collection DVD earns an \\"A\\".
6305232660|4.0|I find myself watching Deep Impact every eight months or so for some reason.  Despite a few flaws, it's really quite a good film, always moving and powerful.  This is just one of a number of apocalyptic films that came out in the late 1990s.  In this scenario, it is a rogue comet that has earth in its sights and stands a very good chance of ending life as we know it.  Elijah Wood, in his pre-Frodo Baggins days, plays Leo Biederman, a high school student who discovers an anomalous object in the heavens and hears nothing back from a local astronomer about it.  A year later, young upstart reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) is chasing a story on the resignation of the Treasury Secretary, confronting him with information about his &quot;mistress Ellie.&quot;  She is perplexed when the Secretary tells her she has her hands on the story of the century, and she is even more perplexed when a bunch of G-men seize her and escort her to a meeting with the President of the United States.  Morgan Freeman plays President Tom Beck, and he is simply marvelous in this role.  Jenny and the whole world soon learn that &quot;Ellie&quot; is not a woman at all, she is an acronym.  E.L.E.=Extinction Level Event.  The President goes public with information on the approaching danger, and the world watches and waits while a group of American and Russian astronauts fly out to try and knock the comet off course.  Robert Duvall plays &quot;Fish&quot; Tanner, the aging NASA pilot who isn't welcomed with open arms by his much younger crew.  From this point on, it is high drama indeed, as the suspense builds mightily toward the day of collision.<br />The cast, with one exception is superb.  Duvall and Freeman deliver their normal great performances, Wood is quite believable as the youngster suddenly famous for finding the earth-seeking comet, and Leelee Sobieski is wonderful as Wood's female counterpart.  Tea Leoni failed to win me over in her role as reporter Jenny Lerner, however.  Her performance as anchor person for the main events was not something I can imagine a national network going with, especially at a time when the earth faces its biggest crisis of all time.  I could also mention one young man who crams as much annoyingly bad acting as is humanly possible into his scant few minutes in front of the camera.  I thought the special effects for this movie were fairly impressive.  The space scenes were quite good, managing to capture the deadly beauty and exotic danger of the killer comet, the explosions were satisfyingly huge, and the impact of the comet on earth is presented fairly convincingly.<br />There are a number of human interest stories built into the plot, and some people might tire of these subplots.  You have a woman dealing with the remarriage of her father and loneliness of her mother, a kid who can only save his childhood sweetheart by marrying her, and all sorts of doings with the masses of people trying to somehow escape on their own because the government can only save a chosen few in underground bunkers.  The intense human drama on earth, such as the emotional complexity shown by President Beck and the characters of Wood and Sobieski, is met with an even more intense human drama in space, as individuals refuse to give up even after mankind has failed to avert disaster.  The complex blending of tragedy and emotional pain teams up with intense feelings of patriotism and inspiring stories of heroism to make the conclusion something powerful that finds its way into my soul and brings a few tears to my eyes.  I think Deep Impact is an underrated movie that has a lot to offer those yet to see it.as anchor person for the main events was not something I can imagine a national network going with, especially at a time when the earth faces its biggest crisis of all time.

630521610X|5.0|Let me begin by saying &quot;Scream&quot; is one of the most brilliantly terrifying movies I've seen, and I'm a huge horror fan. The opening scene with Drew Barrymore features some of the best acting in horror cinema, and is also incredibly horrifying.  The acting in this movie is awesome, including great performances from Skeet Ulrich, Neve Campbell, Rose McGowen, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Jamie Kennedy. Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson mix the suspense and horror with humor, reffering to past horror movies frequently throughout the film. That's one of the things that makes the movie so clever. Clever twist at the end. The climax is suspensful and chilling, but goes a bit overboard with the cursing. Not to worry, though. The film is almost perfect in every other aspect, so it doesn't destroy the story. Rated R for strong violence, gore, and language. An influential classic for teens and adults. The extra features are good too. The commentary by director Wes Craven and screen writer Kevin Williamson is quite interesting. The trailers are entertaining too. I recommend this movie for fans of horror, suspense, psychological thrillers, and satrical comedy. But, if you're not any of these things, the movie is still incredibly entertaining. A must see!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief is not the great successor to The Bends everyone has been waiting for.  Yet musically it continues the right direction Raidohead has been taking overall.  Most importantly, it is a critique of the systemic problems in politics--especially American foreign policy--today.  The album underlines, song by song, how corruption and the manipulation of popular fear of terrorism is being used to drive us all crazier and crazier.  Whether or not you believe Yorke and his mates are right, the most interesting thing here is the way in which Americans can see, via one of the most innovative and thought-provoking bands working today, a non-American perspective at the intersection of recent current events and protest music.
B00008US8R|5.0|This is by far the best CD (overall) that I have ever heard. There has always been at least one song on each CD that I listen to or buy that I dont like. With Fallen, I LOVE every song. Amy Lee's vocals add something special to the music played that no one else could manage. If you love rock and great music, I reccomend you buy this CD, for you will not be disappointed.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I had pretty high expectations when I went to see Spider-Man and I wasn't disappointed. Spidey's origin story is told nicely in an updated way for today's audiences, while still being true to the spirit of the original comic. A lot of guys can probably relate to Peter Parker, because he's a pretty ordinary guy who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances. What I liked best about the movie was Spidey's mid-air acrobatics. Sam Raimi has done a great job of presenting them visually. One particular scene, where Spidey rescues a child from a burning building, is especially exhilarating, as well as moving. Toby Maguire is well cast as the hero.<br />  Willem Dafoe was perfect for the role of the Green Goblin. Man! That guy can act! Kirsten Dunst was great as Mary Jane, although I find some of the scenes between her & Peter Parker a bit boring on repeated viewings. Although they were romantic, they dragged on a little.<br />  Overall, a great movie for the whole family. Bring on the sequel Mr. Raimi!
B0000A02FY|5.0|All I needed was this cd and all she needed was love. Laura Pausini's English debut album packs a sequence of powerful vocals that no other artist can come similar to. \\"I Need Love\\" is the one single that describes the mood of this album, and its significant to be great. Pausini has done it again with this album full of hits!.
B0000584V3|5.0|Blackwater Park is, at this point in time my favourite of their albums. I have not been a diehard opeth fan for all too long, allthough I had heard Morningrise long ago i don't htink i was musically develloped enough(?) yet to truly appreciate it. I am personally a Metalhead, but, my favourite parts of Opeth's songs are their clean guitars and vocals. The heavy parts are great too, but i don't particularily like the sound of the distorted guitars, they seem to lack fullness and power (mostly on older releases. On Blackwater Park the sound is far better than on previous releases, and it is very well rounded. Despite my mild pickyness this is an AMAZING album, in my opinion second to only Dream Theater's &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot;.
0321127420|5.0|This is by far the best description of enterprise patterns I have read to date.<br />Fowler points out that none of these patterns are new (and many have been around for a long while), but never have I seen such a vast array of useful enterprise patterns so well documented.<br />I had heard and/or seen a lot of these patterns already, but the way he describes the patterns and the trade offs involved in choosing the patterns is truly awesome.<br />The first half of the book is a discussion of enterprise architecture in general. I particularly enjoyed the section 'Layering' and 'Organizing Domain Logic'. I could really relate to these discussions, and much of what is written relates to problems I face often in designing my applications.<br />I now have a much better understanding of what a true OO Domain model should look like, and I feel more comfortable in designing a fully OO business model.<br />Some of the patterns presented in relation to database mapping may not be so useful because there are a lot of OR mapping frameworks available to do this for us now. But I still find these patterns useful in understanding how to use an OR mapping framework correctly and how they work under the covers. And you may not always have access to such a framework.<br />I found the discussions on concurrency and transactions very valuable. I also think that the presentation patterns section is quite good too, although again there are a lot of presentation frameworks/tools available for this kink of thing like struts, webwork/velocity, asp.net etc.<br />The only thing that I think this book lacks is a discussion on how to link the layers of an application together. Maybe I will read the book again soon in case I missed something, but I don't think he talks about how to integrate a domain model with the presentation layer, and he kind of skips how to integrate a domain model to the database layer (he just says use mapping which is difficult).<br />I am giving this book 5 stars because it will change (has changed) the way I think about designing software in much the same way that reading a book like Gang of Four.
B00008LDPU|4.0|This DVD is like a redone, more modern version of Robot Carnival, tailored to suit the tastes of American anime consumers.  Never heard of Robot Carnival?  Check the official Amazon review of Animatrix.  Robot Carnival is, like Animatrix, a collection of anime shorts by different distinguished directors--but it's on the subject of robots and artificial intelligence, whereas Animatrix is about the nature of reality, and, well, Buddhist philosophy.  (There are PLENTY of subtle and not-so-subtle references to Buddhism, visually, in Animatrix.  For example: What does the Zion mainframe look like to you?)<br />Of course, the fact that Animatrix feels like an imitation of an earlier anime work doesn't bother me--I really enjoyed it.  But I have a tip for you, to get the most out of it: Pay attention, and be really sure that you understand what the Matrix movies are about.  If you've bought into the ridiculous convoluted theories posed in current magazines or on TV about where the philosophy comes from, you'll miss out on a lot of what these short films have to say.<br />What it comes down to is that the entire Matrix saga, along with Animatrix, relies on most Americans having no familiarity at all with Eastern religions and very little familiarity with classic anime, and so those things are exotic, mysterious, and new in this market.  Anyway, if you want a copy of Robot Carnival, it hasn't been released yet on DVD in the US, and the US VHS release is impossible to find.  Personally, I bought mine (with English subtitles) on DVD in a ZShop from a seller in Singapore.
0375414053|3.0|Although sometimes hard to sympathize with Kate Reddy, still a fun read and probably too true to life for many. Very funny moments in this one! Will definitely look up any additional offerings from this author.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|For those of you who hated this movie because you thought it confusing or devoid of plot, let me state something that is painfully, painfully obvious.  The Matrix movies are a retelling of the story of the Buddha.  If the line \\"No one can tell you what the Matrix is; you have to find out for yourself\\" from the first movie or the tagline on the Matrix Revolutions posters, \\"Everything with a beginning has an ending\\" doesn't convince you, you've missed the point that the movies make.  I'm sure that this film was not as badly misunderstood in, say, Japan, as it was here.  Here's a big hint: Buy yourself a copy of the movie Little Buddha (Chris Isaak, Bridget Fonda, 1993), and wait for the scene where Siddhartha becomes the Buddha.  There's a bit of cheesiness to wade through, I must admit, but believe me, that scene under the Bodhi tree is worth it.  Watch that, and you will understand Matrix Reloaded.
6305090564|4.0|This movie has a ton of action.  While it's not exactly intellectually stimulating it is a fun check your brain and grab some popcorn sci-fi action flick.  The fictional Chinese assault rifle they carry is very cool and the movie doesn't have slow boring spots, it's fast paced till the end.  Check it out for an alternative to shark movies.
B000002KHF|5.0|All of Van Morrison's songs are great...but this album will always be my favorite.  It has been for more than 30 years.  Into the Mystic is the best. This album is as fresh today as it was when it first appeared.  I would give this 50 stars if possible.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie was so cool, it was 10 times better than the first and we meet alot of new characters with extraordinary powers!
B00005221L|2.0|Ok. first of all, TIMEOUT! I don't understand why everybody is giving such a great deal about this movie. The directing is shallow and the characters have irelivent dialog scenes that are not contributing a shred to the movie plot. And the background for the movie is also a messup. We see the Predator spaceship in space hedding to earth, then cut sence to mission briefing. (We believe that something terribly wrong is linked with that spaceship we saw at the opening credits).<BR>Introducing Schwarzenegger in Helicopter (big 'terminator' glasses, a hat and a sigar - couldn't get any better cliche then this). Meets up his old war friend, run a few jokes on each other, nostalgie runs thrugh the air, bla bla... then they enters an argument about our hero working alone with his team on missions they get and concludes by saying &quot;we are a rescue team, not killers..&quot; let's go to the Terrorist ambush sence for a sec. Our hero had a pretty good tactic of setting the wholl camp on fire with no taking prisoners and one sorvivor which Delean ensisted on taking with him. 'Anyone care to explaine?'<BR>And I had a preety hard time understanding the chain of command in the groop. Apperantly there are 2 Sargents: Schwarzenegger and the long-hair indian. ???<BR>Delean apperantly don't know spanish, but he's babbling once a vesy long sentance in this language to the girl.???<BR>Talking with the sorvivor we realize that theres an 'Ancient Legent' about the predator. That he lives in the jungle for centuries. (Are we having second thoughts about the spaceship?)<BR>Our black cubby friend from the groop was a friend of the big tugh who got killed. They havn't talked a single word in the entire movie.???<BR>There are more, believe me. In short, the movie was a disapointment to me.
B0000508U6|5.0|Man, these guys sure did hit the bullseye the first time!  They crafted a gorgeous debut that contains no filler (in fact, my only complaint would be that I wish Track 7 was longer because it sounds really cool, but its only like 30 secs.!).  \\"Yellow\\" is the radio hit, and it is all that, but \\"Trouble,\\" \\"Sparks,\\" and \\"Spies\\" are the songs that really send chills up my spine.  Every song is great to excellent though...check out their new one \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" for another 5 out of 5!
B00003CWPL|2.0|David Lynch is odd. Odd and he's very talented. Eraserhead is a jumbled mess of mixed visual metaphors and adolescent tripe. Poor Jack Nance. Jack could be the sweetest guy in the world. He was (briefly) my apartment manager during the making of Lynch's Dune. He appears as lost in Lynch's film as Lynch clearly is himself.<br />Is it art? Sure. Is it good art? It teeters on the fine line between dorky and cool. I can't say I recommend Eraserhead. There are moments that recall the absurdity of Dali (when he was still an important painter). Visually stunning but ultimately as vapid and empty as any amateur art project.<br />For those folks that are interested (Lyncheads all I'd guess), Eraserhead is available at David's website. It's somewhat expensive but the print looks great although the narrative is as murky as ever. Lynch is a very talented director when working with the right screenplay. This just doesn't happen to be the right one.
B00006879E|5.0|One day my sister came back from a Sugar Ray/Matchbox20 concert this summer and said she was amazed by this new band called Maroon 5 that opened up the show. One day later i heard their first single &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and i was blown away. They bring fun back into rock music and instead of being all about anger and angst they make rock fun again. They have a unique sound to them that blends funk, rock, pop, and soft melodic rock like Coldplay and John Mayer. As good as the album is, they are even better live, they sound like the CD live which is very hard to do with the amount of energy they put out from the stage. the CD has a wide range of songs with funk rockers like &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;Tangled&quot;, softer, melodic songs like &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Secret&quot;, singer/songwriter and coffee house vibed songs like &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, and the more rocking songs like &quot;Through With You&quot; and &quot;Not Coming Home&quot;. They really go out on a limb and have something for everyone. Adam Levine (main songwriter, vocals, guitar) sends the listener through a variety of different emotions about love and life.<BR>When i first listened to &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; i was kinda dissapointed that it wasn't more like &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; but after listening to it more it has grown on me, alot.<BR>My personal favorite song on the CD is &quot;Not Coming Home&quot; which has great guitar licks and music. The lyrics tell the listener about being dumped and having the strength to get over it and be better because of it. Some of my other favorites are &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;.<BR>Overall, this is a great album worth buying. There is great music, great lyrics, and a great future ahead for Maroon 5. I can't wait for their next album.
0517548232|5.0|This is an excellent introduction to Economics.  Hazlitt was a clear writer, and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative.  You don't have to be a student of Economics - this is a book that can benefit every reader.  I just wish more of our politicians had read this book.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay's &quot;Parachutes&quot; is a finely crafted and exquisite ablum that blends together amazingly well.<BR>When this album first came out I liked the band but just never really thought about buying the cd. I purchased this ablum after buying and falling in love with &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; (another amazing album). I discovered that &quot;Parachutes was even better than their follow-up. Each song is fenominal and blends really well with all the other songs. &quot;Parachutes&quot; flows really well from song to song, including great transition songs like &quot;Sparks&quot;, &quot;Parachutes&quot;, and &quot;We Never Change&quot;, which are all great songs and really make a nice flow from the high spots of the CD, but don't get me wrong they are themselves great songs. &quot;Shiver&quot;, &quot;Spies&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, and &quot;High Speed&quot; are the standout tracks in my mind. &quot;Shiver&quot; is just and amazing song, hands down. &quot;Spies&quot; is a perfect mix of spooky, creepy, and melodic, with a hint of pop sensablitiy. &quot;Trouble&quot; always makes me depresse when i listen to it because Chris Martin just sings with so much passion and grief that it makes you hurt, no matter how happy you are.  &quot;High Speed&quot; is another great song with a lot of pop sensablity while still being a great rock song.  One of the best parts of the album is Chris Martin's use of his falsetto. He effortlessly soars on the clouds with his voice and is one of the most recognizable voices i've heard in a long time. As a tenor in my school choir i have a great deal of respect for the notes he hits and with the ease he hits them, he has a real talent that makes Coldplay standout from all the other rock bands out on the scene right now. Altogether, &quot;Parachutes&quot; is a melodic, crafty, and powerfully moving CD that introduces what is to be one of the greatest british rock bands of our time.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I first heard the song &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; a few years ago and instantly fell in love with it--by far one of the most melancholic, beautiful songs ever written.  I was saddened to learn that the only way I'd be hearing it would be via MP3, since the &quot;On the Beach&quot; album had never been released on CD, being completely out of print.  Until now, and I'm so glad Neil decided to finally re-release this (along with 3 other out of print albums).  <br />&quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; is by far the album's best song, but there is not a single dud on here.  Songs like &quot;Motion Pictures,&quot; &quot;Revolution Blues,&quot; &quot;Walk On,&quot; and the title track, are all examples of Neil at his best.  All together, this album is a glorious masterpiece of rock and roll.<br />After listening to this album on fuzzy mp3's for so long, finally being able to listen to this on a properly remastered CD is truly a musical treat (note: more proof that freely-traded MP3s sell records).  Neil has about 40 albums to his credit, and &quot;On the Beach&quot; is one of his top 5 in my opinion.  The world is a much better place with this album being sold again.  Thanks Neil!
B000001YOW|5.0|Porcupine Tree to me is the most exciting and intriguing new band which I have heard in way too many years. So much music today is mundane and requires very little talent but Porcupine Tree certainly is not in this class. What Porcupine Tree is to me is a band that has taken the best aspects of rock music over the past 30 years or so and refined into a sound all their own which just never gets boring. Their range of songs spreads a wide gap from ballads to rockers to soundscapes and that is the case on their incredible recording \\"Signify\\". In fact the song \\"Signify\\" is itself in my opinion worth buying the CD for because if you dare to crank it up your walls will tremble!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Geeeeeeez...Did we really just get a recomendation for Duran Duran because because you can't dance to OK Computer??  Wow...this guy is amazing.  So does all music you critique get rated on the danceable scale?  The last thing Thom Yorke wants you to do is dance to his music for Christ's sake.  OK Computer is brilliant and an amazing album...that's that.  And just because you feel insignifigant because you don't &quot;get it&quot; doesn't mean you can pretend there's nothing to get.  Amazing.  Just go listen to &quot;Girls on film&quot; and keep these desperate attempts at making yourself feel better to yourself.  Thank you.
B000002JS6|5.0|With Back in Black, AC/DC not only achieved their greatest success but showed signs of crossing over from the bluesy bar-rock of the 70's into 80's Arena Metal.  The opener Hell's Bells is very much a dark metal song, but every track is delivered with the same attitude and intensity of AC/DC's earlier efforts.  I like to break albums down track by track but here it's not neccesary, the tracks are all very similar.  Regardless the AC/DC sound never gets old and the final track only leaves you wanting more.
0671775308|5.0|I found this book to be very precise and insightful. I understood the underlining points that he makes and understand what he is saying when he elaborates on these points. Obviously Richard Lam did not see this, why I don't know. I found it not to read like a textbook and I have read many being in the computer field. I would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about becoming economically independent.
B00005JM09|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen in years. The story really does answer a lot of questions and brings some new questions to. A Terminator 4 would be really nice to see. It would most likley be during the war and how the Resistance defeated SKYNET. If you didn't see T3 in theaters the movie comes out on video and DVD November 11, along with the game.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|After several release date setbacks, a summer of touring, and months of internet teasers, Neil Young finally releases what is certain to become one of his landmark albums. <br />I recently finished reading the superb behemoth of a Neil Young biography, \\"Shakey.\\" It was wonderful getting to unearth some of Neil's treasures while reading the text, but I felt a bit letdown by the ending. I suppose it's because the biography really isn't over yet. I can't help but wonder if Jimmy McDonough is kicking himself for not waiting a few years to publish his masterwork with \\"Greendale\\" as an entire final chapter. I guess we'll have to wait for the second edition.<br />Neil Young's newest album takes place in the fictional town of Greendale, surrounding the events of the Green family. Young sets up his web of tales by introducing the dissatisfaction of the older generation with our current world, the presence of the devil amongst us, a cop shooting by a beloved son, the death of grandfather figure by media oppression, and the rebellious Alaskan escape of the youngest of the family, Sun Green. <br />A minimalist NY with Crazy Horse Trio (minus Poncho Sampedro), seems a perfect fit for the album, however some will be more familiar with an acoustic version of the album, which was leaked by Young himself to the internet after a live performance from Dublin in Spring 2003. The bonus DVD release feautres this live solo performance, while the CD features the trio as above. Others may be more familiar with the more raucous Crazy Horse version, which is what he toured with during Summer 2003 to a very receptive virgin audience. <br />The album is very raw and sounds as though it was captured in one take, much as the \\"Tonight's the Night\\" sessions. The comparison is especially fitting given the character mode that Young yet again fell into while creating this masterwork. At its brightest, it recalls \\"I'm the Ocean\\" though harkens to the desperation of \\"Crime in the City\\" or \\"Cortez the Killer.\\" It's never quite a bright rocking album, but is persistently moving. Also novel to this album is that the entirety of the record are newly composed and recorded songs, whereas many of his previous albums feature new songs as well as songs he's mulled over for years and re-recorded dozens of times.<br />Hopefully in the future, Young will release a live concert version of the full live performance he toured with recently, as it included a gigantic set and cast of approximately 50 people (including his own children) lip syncing to Young, as he sang all the parts of the characters (as he does on the CD). <br />I dunno. Perhaps I'm just a sucker for concept albums. 'Gentlemen' by the Afghan Whigs, 'Dark Side of the Moon' and 'The Wall' by Pink Floyd, 'Tommy' by The Who, and even the Colonel Jeffrey Pumpernickel album are some of my favorites. <br />While Young persistently has lukewarm periods (even his most recent, Are You Passionate? has yet to occupy my record shelves), his best albums are incomparable to any of his contemporaries (except perhaps Dylan), nor to the current crop of [fluff]. <br />Bottom line: if you've been longing for a good record, check this one out.
B0000524CY|5.0|In this review I'll be reviewing both DVD versions of the excellent film The Exorcist that are available on DVD.  (There is another Exorcist DVD that came out in 1997, but is now discontinued.  This will not be reviewed.)  First I will review the DVDs, then I will analyze both versions of the film to see which is the better version to own.<br />DVDs:<br />Picture: Both versions are presented in their original theatrical aspect ratio of about 1.78:1.  In terms of video quality, both DVDs are about equal. Sharpness and detail are pretty good for a film that's now 30 years old.  This is certainly the best The Exorcist has ever looked. If you have viewed only the VHS or the Laserdisc, then this can look like a pretty washed out film.  Not so on DVD!  Colors are very good for a 30 year old film.   (5/5)<br />Sound:  While the video quality on both DVDs were very close, here, The Version You've Never Seen definately has the edge.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 remix on the 25th Anniversary DVD is pretty good.  Surrounds are not that active, and most of the action seems to take place in the center channel.  There is one scene in the film that screamed for surround sound, but the surrounds aren't active in this scene on this DVD.  That scene is during the exorcism, the room begins to shake violently as Regan is floating in the air.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 EX remix on The Version You've Never Seen corrects not only this scene, but the surrounds are much more active, for a much more enthralling, and ultimately, more frightening mix.  The mix on The Version You've Never Seen is absolutely astonishing for a 30 year old film.     25th Anniv: (4/5)     Version You've:  (5/5)<br />Extras:  The 25th Anniversary DVD is filled with fascinating extras.  First off is a commentary by director Willaim Friedkin.  This is very entertaining and informative.  There's also a commentary by William Peter Blatty, which isn't as good, but still worthwhile.  Next up is the excellent 75 minute documentary The Fear of God: The Making of The Exorcist.  This is really a great documentary, and is one of the best I've ever seen.  Then there are additional interviews with Friedkin and Blatty discussing Friedkin's cut of the film, and how Blatty prefers the cut that was orinally shown to him.  Next up are sketches and storyboards.  Finally there are about 7 or 8 TV spots and 4 theatrical trailors.  The Version You've Never Seen doesn't have near as many extras.  First up, there's a new commentary by Friedkin, which just basically explain what's going on onscreen, and some the spiritual meanings behind the movie.  There's also some production notes, 2 theatrical trailors, 4 TV spots, and 2 radio commercials.    25th anniv: (5/5)    Version You've:  (3/5)<br />Movie:<br />The Exorcist is an excellent film.  Anyone who says that this film is pure evil, and should never be seen by anyone and Satan worshipers would only enjoy this movie don't have any idea what they're talking about.  I'm a Christian, and I think that this is a very important film that has a deep and powerful message.  Does the devil win at the end?  Absolutely not.  Notice if you will, when Father Karras screams at the demon to come into him, in an act of self-sacrifice, his face flashes briefly then he jumps out the window to save Regan.  And as Father Dyer is giving him the last rights, Damion squeezes Dyers hand, showing that he is conscience enough to give his soul to God.  So, good won over absolute evil.  Is there evil in the film?  Yes.  What I admire most about The Exorcist is that Friedkin had the guts to show pure evil, and he didn't pussy foot around the subject matter.  I also feel that the masturbation with the crucifix scene was merited, and did serve an ultimate purpose.   Is the movie offensive?  Yes, but it had to be.  One must remember that if somebody were possessed by a demon, that this is probably what it would be like.  The demon would scream every foul word possible in an attempt to weakenthose around it. I believe what William friedking says about the film.  You take out of the film what you bring to it.  If you believe, like i do, that there is good in the world, and that it can overcome evil, then The exorcist will re-affirm your faith.   I believe that this is an excellent, thought provoking film, and should be seen by every one, especially Catholics and Christians who have open minds.  <br />The Version You've Never Seen adds 11 minuted of footage back into the original film.  I didn't mind the new ending.  I felt that the \\"spider-walk\\" sequence felt really odd, and out of place.  The extended dialog between Karras and Merrin is well done, and probably should have been there in the first place.  Also there is a new examination scene at the doctors office with Regan.  This, too, should have been left in the film.  Another important scene that should have been in the original cut is a scene with Father Karras listening to a tape of Regan's natural voice before the possession.  There is another cut scene that can bee seen on the 25th Anniversary DVD of Regan and her mother, Chris MacNeil touring around Washington for Regan's birthday that I really wish would have been put back in.  Whichever way you choose to watch the film, it's still a masterpice, and the scariest film of all time.   Both versions:  (5/5)
B0000AI44Q|4.0|The first major rock artist's &quot;rock opera&quot; since the Who's &quot;Quadrophenia,&quot; Neil has expanded on his &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; days that used to be.  I've only played the CD twice; but my, my; hey, hey; great job!  Now, where will you go from here?
B00005IC2H|5.0|Astounding. This word shined in my mind a couple of years ago while listening for the first time to this record, which I bought with no clue about what kind of music I was going to listen to. OK, I don't understand a single word of the lyrics, since I'm not Icelandic, but this is not the point. The nearest comparisons I can do are the smell of wet leaves in a misty forest, or the slow changing light of a faraway, old as universe, quasar. A psychedelic voyage with no drugs, or a drug itself. A rebirth experience. Thank you, Sigur Ros, I dream again.
0393057658|5.0|Though the topic of Moneyball centers around Baseball its scope has a much broader reach.  In the same manner that Lewis's Next examines how the Internet has toppled several societal barriers, Moneyball takes a look at how statistics and information question our understanding of value.  In a nutshell it all boils down to this; don't be fooled by what you see.  Over time its the small and undetected things which can make a big difference.<br />Baseball serves as a perfect proving ground for this expanded perspective.  A baseball season is 162 games long.  Over that period the difference between a .275 hitter and a .310 is just one hit a week.  As a fan you could watch a whole season and, unless you followed a team's statistics, you would find it hard to discern who was the better hitter.<br />But we already have mechanisms for tracking batting average along a whole host of other hitting statistics.  With free agency the best hitters are rewarded accordingly.  The question for Baseball becomes - how accurate is our current system of valuation?  How much more valuable is a slugger like Sammy Sosa than good on base man like Jason Kendall?<br />Moneyball tracks the path of the Oakland A's and their maverick GM Billy Beane.  Beane and his crew employ all of the latest statistical analysis for evaluating players, much to the chagrin of the old time scouts who know a ball player when they see one.  Through their studies, Beane and his staff recognize that on base percentage is highly undervalued in the current market.  This flies in the face of conventional wisdom but the results bare them out.  Over the 2000-2003 seasons the Oakland A's with a payroll roughly a third the size of the New York Yankees won more games than the Yankees during that period.<br />While this book is a must read for all baseball fans it also carries with it a much broader value.  We make millions of assumptions everyday based on appearances.  But it's not always the brightest or the most articulatewho gets the job done.  Sometimes its the little guy, slugging away, who has a much larger impact.  The challenge is to be able look beyond what the eye can see and focus on the bottom line.  If you can, then you're playing Moneyball.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|At this stage of his career, Neil Young should be touring on a greatest hits package, lining his coffers and keeping new thought to a minimum, if his contemporaries (the Stones, the Who, McCartney, et al.) are any frame of reference.<br />Of course, Neil Young the artist knows no contemporaries, and to fail to challenge himself (and by association his audience) would be the end of Neil Young the artist.<br />So Neil perseveres, throwing more (and better) curveballs than Hall of Fame curveballer Bert Blyleven.  Call Greendale Neil's best curveball yet.<br />At age 57, Greendale is Young's first concept album.  The 78-minute, 10-song masterpiece centers on the fictional town of Greendale, a small, tightly knit community located far up the California coast.  The album, featuring Young backed by longtime collaborators Crazy Horse, ranks with any great Neil Young album, and relates stories of several generations of the Green family, from Grandpa Jed to Edith & Earl to Sun and Luna, and culminates with protagonist Sun Green chaining herself to a symbol of corporate corruption in an office lobby, shouting slurs against Powerco and likeminded business, before escaping to Alaska to \\"save the planet for another day.\\"<br />Young's lyrical wit has never been sharper.  The album commences with Grandpa telling cousin Jed, \\"I won't retire, but I might retread.\\"  Neil might retread the form of some of his classic work, but Greendale is remarkably fresh.  Later, in \\"Sun Green,\\" Neil precociously predicts the reaction to his new work:<br />\\"No one could explain it,<BR>It just got great reviews.\\"<br />Rock and roll doesn't get any better than Neil Young, and Neil Young doesn't get any better than Greendale.<br />D.J. Harmeling<BR>...
B000000OAC|4.0|This is a solid effort from Queen.  Great opening, with the one two punch of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;.  Some people don't like &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; because of the weird effects in it, but I like it.  &quot;All Dead, All Dead&quot; is a beautiful ballad.  &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot; is a terrific song that deserved to be a bigger hit than it was.  The Roger Taylor sung &quot;Fight From the Inside&quot; is simply not very good.  &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; is a great hard rock song.  &quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot; is a good song that is probably the closest Queen ever came to recording a blues song.  &quot;Who Needs You&quot; is just okay.  The epic &quot;It's Late&quot; is really good.  The album closes with &quot;My Melancholy Blues&quot;, a pretty ballad that spotlights Freddie's piano playing.  As for the remix of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, it is interesting, but it doesn't really belong here.
B00009UW0N|4.0|This is the one that started them all, without the original Halloween we would never have gotten a Friday the 13th, or A Nightmare on Elm Street. Presented here in it's new 25th Anniv. Edition is one of the best horror movies of all time and if you haven't sen it yet, SEE IT NOW.<br />This dvd is nice and to be honest alot better than some would have you believe. There has been alotmade of a color correction problem but you really don't notice it when watching the movie.<br />So if you want Halloween on dvd, get this version.
0805047905|5.0|This has been my son's favorite book since he was 6 months old.  We read it to him at least 7 times a day and at night this is the book that puts him to sleep because as we read it over and over, we turn each page slower and say each line quieter.<br />About the book . . . the illustrations are really nice.  The repetition throughout the book (brown bear, brown beat what do you see . . . red bird, red bird what do you see, teacher, teacher what do you see) creates anticipation in children as they know what may come on the next page.<br />I am thoroughly please with this book which is why I just ordered more from this series (Polar Bear, Polar Bear what do you hear?).<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000003RCY|5.0|Onstage or on their albums, Rammstein is immediate, hardhitting, and fearsome.  Be prepared for heavy driving rhythms backed by Til's gruff german vocals, cool synthesizer sections, and an overall assault of sound so tight it'll make your neck ache from banging your skull so relentlessly.  Some have compared them to KMFDM, but that comes nowhere near the strength of Rammstein.  If you like this disc, you should see them live.  They put on probably one of the best shows I've seen.
0671027344|5.0|What is this book?  The story is truly inspiring and insightful, heart-renching and awe-felt!  The lessons are learned in the farthest corners of the mind, and the strength of self.  If you can dig that, you will certainly enjoy the book.  Still don't think you'll like it?  THINK AGAIN! What discipline, drive, and talent!  The main thing about the book is that the author did a great job of capturing the role models in a way that serves to provide a path for youths as well as pride for some parents.  Bravo Mr. Chbosky!<br />When I was a kid I was a huge fan of the original Kiss (mid 70's) I couldn't get enough of the band. It was a large part of my life and feel it really helped me through the tough growing up years.  This book could be the same for children today.  I mean let's all be honest with each other (for once!) and say that the teenage years are a much overlooked dystopia. <br />This book was a little hard to understand especially when it only using \\"I\\" and \\"my\\" and \\"mine\\" and written in letters and such, but never the less I read this book in only one day; a few hours actually. I had to read it, otherwise I would've never heard of it or read it.  Thank goodnees for those duties that I have as burdens!  Anyway, since then I have read it countless times, relishing every page. The hero in the story, Charlie, is very likeable as he goes through the trials and tribulations of growing up, searching for friends and dreaming of the beautiful girl next door. Reading this book should be mandatory for all boys!  Maybe girls too.  But that's up too Parliament, or the President for my American friends (Hello down there!).  I don't make the laws.  I only suggest them.  Ha ha.  <br />Anyhow, this novel is one of the most unique ones ever written. There is essentially no plot. There is just one main idea spread throughout the entire book.  Of course there are always narrow minded people who might object to the contents of this book, probably the same people who'd object tothe Venus the Milo, or 'nude paintings' in a museum. Never mind them.  For any intelligent and open-minded person there is nothing to object to, just Great Art to enjoy and a valuable lesson about life as it's meant to be. If you are still in doubt, do yourself a favour and buy it, and if you give it half a chance, it will enrich your life and broaden your horizon. In a way, you can't afford NOT to buy it...  Especially if they pass a law that says you have to read it which has as a penalty a large fine. Ha ha.
B00006JIAF|5.0|This cd made me realize that there are still music artists out there that are good. The Strokes managed to emerge from all the Britneys and Backstreet Boys of the world and make their own sound. Granted it's influenced by Television, Velvet Underground and other 70s/80s bands, it's still their own sound. The Strokes, along with the Vines, the Hives, Interpol, and every other artist that has emerged the past few years are a good listen for you if you like the Velvet Underground, if you like the Talking Heads, the Ramones...and if you like the Strokes, and The Vines, and everyone, then you'll like the 70s/80s bands I mentioned before. Just give them one listen.
B00000JY1X|5.0|one<br />when i first started listening to this album, I was enjoying the melancholic existence of an alcoholised student with no girlfriend. 69 love songs provided me with an ideal sountrack to which I could plunge into my Sentimental Reveries. <br />the one thing that saved the album (and myself) from ever being a pathetic 'smooche' was the ever-present dark humor and sharp wit of Stephin Merrit. and of course... the musical briliancy and playfulnes that complements (and occasionaly, contradicts) the lyrics. <br />  two<br />when i found The Love Of My Life, the 69 love songs took on a new meaning for me. no longer was Stephin Merrit a depressing but trusted traveling partner in my sentimental and drunken explorations of the world of Unfulfilled Love. rather he provided an inexhaustable resource of romantic imagery  which I would readily apply to myself and my Lover. again, think i mostly managed to avoid the Pathetic by keeping an ounce of cynism always at hand...<br />  three<br />now, after The Love Of My Life unambigously declared that i was not The Love Of Her Life, i find the music unbearable. 'Papa Was A Rodeo' makes me thing of the Romance Of The Century and how it slipped through my fingers. the celebratory joy of 'When My Boy Walks Down The Street' makes me think of she who used to be My Girl walking down the street. 'Underwear' and 'Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabits' well... <br />  conclusion<br />Sentimentaly/Romance and Cynisism/Reason always seemed to me like oposite and unreconcilable poles on the sphere of love, but for a true expresion of love in art (which i belive 69 lovesongs is) perhaps they must exist in together in a permanent state of ambivalence?<br />69 love songs is in my opinion a seminal acheivment in pop lyricism. it is staggeringly impressive in scope and substance, but always delightfully whimsical and flimsy, never self-important. <br />let all musicans and lovers of the world go forth and be inspired
B00009V7T2|5.0|WOW men, I'm a big PROGROCK FAN and I have to say that THIS IS REALLY PROGRESSIVE.<br />This album is just AMAZING, a collage of great sounds like jazz, funk, punk, latinjazz, percussions, strings, psychodelic guitars and a big progrock influence.<br />You have to buy it if you like King Crimson or the first Pink Floyd sound... this is really PSYCODELIC and PROG. GREAT!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The movie was great but the DVD is just going to be better. Not only is it going to be a 2-Disc special edition, but its also going to be filled to the brim with extras including 2 commentaries, 11 new featurettes and 11 deleted/ extended scenes, a still gallery, trailers and much, much more. To me besides a few ( and i mean few) movies of this Summer, X2 was one of the only few sequels that lived up to its anticipation and delivered the goods. The storyline was brilliant, the effects pretty damn good for a 125 million dollar budget and the acting top notch. So if u  haven't watched the movie, watch it!!! And if your planning on buying this DVD, Buy it!!!!!!!! (esspecially with the X-MEN 1.5 DVD if u haven't bought it yet)
B0000942HV|4.0|How many time can you redo Tubular Bells? Let me count the ways:<BR>1973 - The classic<BR>1975 - The orchestral version<BR>1980 - The live version (Exposed)<BR>1981 - The rare Ray Janos remix (Epic/Virgin PE 34116)<BR>1992 - Tubular Bells 2 - lively remake, still love it<BR>1998 - Tubular Bells 3 - a sonic dismemberment<br />The sound quality is muchly improved and indeed Mike did try to keep it to the original as much as possible, even though some of the changes are rather obvious. The use of John Cleese was quite clever but could have been a little louder. I did not like though how the caveman was performed. Adding his sister Sally made it more campy than scary.  All in all though, it is a must buy and need to add it to your Mike Oldfield collection.  Its good to have Warner bring his music back to the U.S. (about time!)<BR>Now Mike, bring us &quot;Hergest Ridge 2004&quot; and put an end to the controversy  on which version is better.
B000002H2H|5.0|it could be the best metallica album. there are other  metallica albums like kill em all, the black album, and master of puppets that come very close, but i think this is the best. my fav songs are, well, all of the songs. thats why i think its the best metallica album. so get this, and enjoy every minute of it.
B00005JMD3|4.0|This is a good film, at least one where we did not feel our money was wasted (as is the case with 90% of the films). The acting is very good, the effects are convincing and not overdone, the plot is somewhat predictable but never laborious. All in all, a good film, and one to enjoy with your significant other or with older family members.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I ponied up the big bucks for a pavilion seat at the local shed, having been juiced beyond belief by Jim Jarmusch's 96 film &quot;Year of the Horse&quot;, having been a fan of Neil's for 25 years or so, and awaiting seeing the horse live ever since seeing the film - I was only slightly disappointed to get the full frontal Greendale at the show, nowhere near as miffed as the yoyos who came to hear the same 6 songs they hear on the local Clear Channel radio station...(over and over again)<br />That disappointment was counter - balanced by how good it was to see Neil doing what the hell he pleased up there: something new, something he wanted to be doing...As a fan I ask for no more or less, you gotta be open to that it seems to me .. I missed those Arc and Weld shows I was craving, shame on me that ain't Neils fault...<br />Oh yeah, the album..<br />Moral of the story?  Greendale is tasty.  Downright tasty.  Much less filller than the 90s albums IMHO, and I missed Poncho about half the time..I like the raw production on this record and Bandit is a classic tune.  You should buy this album just for that tune..<br />This record looks to me on CD like it should be on vinyl, the artwork reminds me of something I would take from my brothers collection, like a John Barleycorn or something...
B00003CXA4|5.0|It's so comforting to know there are still values in mankind. It is so inspirational to know that there have been people who have won some of the hardest wars in peace and respect for human nature. I have rarely been touched by history as much as I have been by looking closer at Gandhi's life. If we only had more such people on earth, we can live in hope that mankind will not cease to exist. This movie will not only give you a deep sense of history but also leave you with a deep sense of humanity and humility. A trully beautifully crafted movie that pays respect to a trully great man. Great performances, excellent transfer on DVD, trully captivating and inspirational.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I have seen this DVD several times and found it wonderful. It is a collection of what Gilmour had done with Pink Floyd and beyond. The acoustic version of \\"Shine on you crazy diamond\\", \\"High hopes\\" with a well-matched cello background, \\"Comfortably numb\\" with a grand piano and acoustic guitar spiced by some light electric guitar solos in the middle and at the end, A touching version of \\"Wish you were here\\", \\"Coming back to life\\" taking benefit from an energetic choir, \\"Fat old sun\\" absolutely like the original one (although with no guitar solo in the end), two songs from Syd Barret, one of Rick's song with his surprising performance and finally a special version of Comfortably Numb being sang by Bob Geldof ( Mr. Pink )!!!<br /><br />This concert would be a little strange at the beginning for Pink Floyd fans . It doesn't have lasers, heavy electric guitar sounds, and many elements of Pink Floyd shows. All tracks are quite soft and easy on the ear. It is a blues/jazz like performance of Pink Floyd's songs and all. Some tracks are very similar to the studio version and some are dramatically different .<br /><br />I recommend this DVD to anyone who likes David Gilmour and his style in guitar playing and also to any Pink Floyd fan who likes to experience another aspect of Pink Floyd's music. This DVD is not too long (about 1.5 hour) and is worth watching at all times.<br /><br />I reckon David Gilmour in concert and Roger Waters' In the Flesh are the two best DVD titles to buy by Pink Floyd fans at this time.<br /><br />Buy this DVD. You'll definitely enjoy it. It shows Gilmour in his best shape (Fat old son!!!). Good to see he's cheerful and plays and sings really well. His voice still sounds young. In my opinion, he sang even better than in the Pulse tour. This is a must-have DVD for anyone who likes classic rock tunes.<br /><br />The only bad point about this DVD is that the sound is not truly surround as what people might expect from DVDs. The music comes from front and the crowd from the rear . That's about all!and the crowd from the rear . That's about all!
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I saw the Greendale show 4 times this tour, which set me up well for following along with the loose story of this CD.  The accompanying DVD will do that too well for those who didn't see the shows, as Neil breaks into long, beat-my-head-against-the-wall-begging-him-to-just-play-already explanations of each song in this live, acoustic rendition of all the Greendale songs.  <br />So how's the music?  Let's start by saying I'm too big of a Neil fan to give a truly unbiased opinion.  I think Poncho Sampedro's (Crazy Horse rhythm guitarist) absence - for whatever reason he's not included in the recording - is missed in giving his big, thick cords to the music, but that's being a picky fan.  Neil claims to have written and recorded these songs in order of appearance on Greendale.  The last few songs really go on for awhile (10-12 minutes), which is typical for Neil & the Horse, but shows his ideas for the stories grew with time.<br />I read in a Rolling Stone interview with Neil that some people are saying this is worse than \\"Trans\\", the long hated black sheep of Neil's '80's side road projects.  Those people are basically, well, fools.  Neil pushes his creativity, his art, his fans here, but it isn't so far off the Crazy Horse path that it should be discounted as Trans-esque.  This isn't a Neil-fan starter kit, but it is good music. <br />Highlights would include the song \\"Bandit\\", with its cool acoustic guitar tuning and simple beauty.  The pump organ in \\"Bringin' down dinner\\" is so sad and so wonderful.  \\"Sun Green\\" rocks like a banshee and has that catchy \\"Hey Mr. Clean, You're Dirty Now Too\\" chorus that will NOT leave your head anytime soon.<br />Neil Young is the King of Rock-n-roll, folks.  He's 57 and still following his muse wherever that may lead.  Pushing his music and fans, rather than riding the coattails of the past.  He is not classic rock.  He is not a greatest hits act.  Not too many others can boast that and still be relevant through oh-these-so-many-years.  <br />But, then again, that's just one man's opinion.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Is this the best movie of all time? No---. Is it great entertainment? YES!! Even tho' the purists and anti-purists have quibbled over the degree of \\"faithfulness\\" to Tolkien's books, the film must be regarded as a work that stands on it's own merit. I believe I read the entire LOTR trilogy 7 times over a period of 30 years; I was never really able to visualise Gollum until now! What a magnificent combination of acting and special effects. The portrayal of a poor creature torn between an all-consuming desire for posession of the \\"precious\\" and his \\"master\\" , (Frodo Baggins) was terrific!<br />As I commented earlier, this is not the greatest movie of all time , but it certainly is probably the best FANTASY movie. Yes--the book was better--a consummate masterpiece within the genre; but who cares? 5 stars for acting; 5 stars for scenery ; 5 stars for special effects (especially the Ents!) ; 4 stars for the film version of the book. That makes it overall the only 5 star film I have ever rated.
B0000AI44Q|3.0|More like 3 1/2 stars, this is a return to form for Young, with 2/3 of Crazy Horse on board (Poncho sat this one out), accompanied by a DVD from a solo acoustic reading of the songs herein performed in Ireland, a place Young seems to have some awareness of in his burn-out mode of snapping into focus in the midst of other reveries. Rolling Stone called this a \\"rock opera.\\" Oh Lord, they've been staring at Jessica Simpson's hooters too long. This is more a long, and surprisingly for Young, well-connected narrative that takes in the goings on of the Green family.<BR>The Greens are mythologically the descendants of those left standing on the pier in \\"Powderfinger.\\" Now in the 21st Century, transported to some place in the North American frontier where their own psychological wounds and the observations homespun from the senior generation present a picture of America, freedom, the onslaught of various and sundry radicalisms remind one of the philosophical, psychological and scoiological plot lines of Thomas Pynchon's remarkable VINELAND. Of course, for Young and Crazy Horse that makes perfect sense. They are themselves characters come to life from the pages of THE CRYING OF LOT 49. In any case, Neil spins a remarkable tale with unique viewpoints, as peculair as you might expect from him.<BR>The music is very much in the Crazy Horse vein of rootsy, rythmic, train-like chugging through the landscape of the lyrics. While there are not a lot of musical nuances throughout the album, nonetheless it has that hypnotic groove of R L Burnside or John Lee Hooker. Crazy Horse locks in with Young better than anyone, and they are definitely a text book case of the whole being far more incendiary than the sum of the individual fires. Since it is a trio, Talbot and Molina hold down the pace with a gravity and the steady pan of a cinema camera, as Young takes on the sinewy leads he hasn't struck since the BROKEN ARROW CD. The opening track, \\"falling from above\\", evokes both the bodies falling from the Trade Towers as well as the fall from grace by man himself. Lyrically it is as profound a statement as anything in North American songwriting. This is better than classic Neil Young, it is a moment of genius, and works with extraordinary impact accoustically on his vintage Martin as well as fired up on the Les Paul. \\"leave the driving\\" is a stinging assault on the right wing pogroms of bureaucrats like Donald Rumsfeld who want a placated American public who will release control over their own fate in exchange for tax relief of ridiculously minimal impact. But this song redirects the sinister elements of the story, and refocuses the attention on how we sell our souls in subtle ways for the most absurdly impotent gratifications, or to somehow reassure ourselves that all is in hand.<BR>Pynchon's book dealt with a main character who flew through the VA window in his small town every year so that his government handouts for his time in Viet Nam would continue, all the while thinking he was conning the feds. It isn't until his daughter arrives and demands to know the truth about her mother that he and everyone else in the book must face the truth about themsleves, their place in history, the arc of gravity's rainbow and in what capacity anyone can really claim to be free. Young is on about the same issues. While the first Gulf War seemed to have ignited a vituperative attack on the promulgator of a 1000 points of light with as much energy as the opening strikes of that war, this time around, a more grizzled and wizened poet constructs a series of parables that never venture far from the opening observations of \\"falling\\", but, through \\"devils' sidewalk\\", \\"carmichael\\" and on to \\"be the rain\\", lay out, like the grid work of Jim Mazzeo's drawings, the city plan for the human heart and soul to claim freedom, while respecting how interconnected all of our lives on this planet, irresepctive of culture and religion, have become.<BR>Young knows that this President is not the carny huckster of his predecessor, and so while bluffing his way through a seeming inability to string a coherent sentence together, this leader has crafted a far more lethal web, ensnaring a public dying to be fed what they want to hear in homespun tones of an everyman. Young turns that comfy tongue in upon itself and casts a glaringly bright light on how forked it is.<BR>I'm not sure you'll return to this CD often, the tempo is a bit too much the same. In some respects, that makes you work a little harder to get below the surface, which may be Young's point. But there is plenty of room to expand the takes of these tunes. All of them are quite simple, and in that simplicity lies the complexity of the dialectics involved. Given his past several outings, I would have figured a project like this was beyond Neil at this point in his career. It's an amazing effort on his part to have inspirationally spun these sets of parables so craftily. Mind you, no one will ever accuse Young of being a Shakespearean wordsmith. His lyrics tumble out in verse as broken as that spastic two step he dances during his rock and roll numbers, but somehow even that is to the point. There are issues here to be weighed, and the broken rhythms draw attention, unlike the smooth talk of the world's leaders, to the disconnect threatening the integrity of the innocent \\"sun green\\" like souls of our world.<BR>This isn't AFTER THE GOLDRUSH, but in some inexplainable way, it has a lot more to offer.
B00003CXTF|1.0|Hollywood's worst formula ever: Take one of America's darkest moments, add a sappy love story between  a nurse and two no talent, flava of the month, babyfaces add some forgettable special effects and you get this piece of dribble.I saw it in the theater and after 1 hour coudln't wait for it to end. The love story killed the whole thing. I don't know why Ben Affleck is so popular. Since &quot; Good Will Hunting&quot; he has not made one single decent movie. This is his biggest disapointment as well as the biggest disgrace to the people that died at Pearl Harbor. Oh the pain. Like Jim Morrison said in &quot;Shaman Blues&quot; ; &quot; Will you stop, Will you stop....... the pain!
0142004235|4.0|I admit I am only 1/3 of the way through this book, but I have been so impressed with the depth of the writing, the color of the language and the art in play.  While Steinbeck clearly is painting with broad brush strokes, and presents a simplified and overplayed image of woman as source of destruction/evil, I still find myself drawn in by the story and the substance of the book thus far.  A good choice to kick off Oprah's Book Club again, if only to see a promising, flawed, and complex piece of fiction receive a wide audience.  Kudos to her for bringing a work like this to the masses.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I don't own Hybrid Theory or Reanimation so I can't tell if this album is better than those two but Meteora is a great album.<br />1. Foreword - I'm not a big fan of these 15 second intro songs but this one goes well into the next song. <br />2. Don't Stay - Pretty good song with some nice turntable scratching with the guitars. 4/5<br />3. Somewhere I Belong - The first single from the album and also a very good one. 4.5/5<br />4. Lying From You - This song has a really good beat during the verses and the bridge is really good. 5/5<br />5. Hit The Floor - This is basically a hip-hop song with Mike rapping both verses, and the bridge, with Chester's screaming in the chorus. Also really good. 4/5<br />6. Easier To Run - Not bad. The bridge is my favourite part of the song. 3.5/5<br />7. Faint - The second single from the album and just excellent. 5/5<br />8. Figure.09 - This is like the &quot;One Step Closer&quot; of Meteora. Pretty good. 4/5<br />9. Breaking The Habit - Another excellent song with a great flow and beat. My favourite song on the album. 5/5<br />10. From The Inside - Not bad. Probably my least favourite song on the album. 3/5<br />11. Nobody's Listening - A great rap song and the beat is just too good. 5/5<br />12. Session - This song is all instrumental with some good scratching and all that. 4/5<br />13. Numb - A great song to end the album with. You could call this the &quot;Crawling&quot; of Meteora. 5/5<br />In conclusion, Meteora is a great addition to my CD collection despite it's short length. It really would be 4.5 stars but it gets 5 for the 40 page booklet and the enhanced CD.
B00005JLXE|1.0|I hate this movie. Plain and simple. This movie not only had a terrible script, but it suffered from a talentless director who didn't seem to know what the hell he was doing. ... Michael Clark Duncan and Joe Pantoliano were WAY underused and misused as well.<BR>Colin Ferrel did a decent job as Bullseye. But Affleck and Garner... not even worth wasting words on. I really wish I could give this steaming, stink pile of dung a negative rating. It's one of those rare films that truly deserves on. I can honestly say I felt like turning it off during the first 20 minutes. The only movie I ever felt like turning off or walking out on besides this was Battlefield Earth. Now these two films aren't completely worthless. They do raise thought-provoking ethical questions. Is it ok to want a refund at the dollar movie? Is is ok to claim the DVD is defective just to exchange it for a new one and take the new one to another store and claim it was a gift and get your money back? In the cases of Daredevil and Battlefield Earth, the answer is a simple \\"duh.\\" It's sad to see that actors with talent such as Colin Ferrel, Joe Pantoliano and Michael Clark Duncan stoop to the level of Daredevil. I really hope their next pieces of work are less insulting that this one.
0345440803|5.0|This book is so smart and so gentle.  It's saving my life, my marriage, and especially my baby.  I've learned how to let my baby soothe himself to sleep, and how to find time for myself during the day.  I'm going to recommend it to everyone with a new baby!
B00005JM02|5.0|WOW Pixar do it again, this is a very funny movie, with a lot of message, the graphics are very rich and beautiful, its incredible how crisp is. the marine species are very well represented, and the shark, oh my god the sharks is one of the best scenes in the hole movie. <br />I want to see it on my DVD with my Mit RPTV HD, so please give me my copy today!!!!!
B00005JLPK|4.0|deep into the thoughts of Frida, an artist who's work I've seen in Texas for years but knew little of. It is very informative to see this film and learn some linear history about Frida and Rivera.<br />I first saw the european release complete with saucy love scene between Frida and her female lover. Later I saw the American DVD and that scene was ommitted.<br />The dance scene between Ashley Judd and Selma is the hook to keep the audience glued for the rest of the film which is full of color and imagery of Mexico from the inside out.<br />How Frida was able to love such an unfaithful man for 30 yrs is beyond me.<br />As a woman I think the thing that I related to most in seeing Frida's story was her battle with her crippling injuries after the bus accident. She was young and vibrant then a changed woman after the wreck, learning to cope with it for the rest of her life. This I can relate to, especially as an artist and the impact such things can have on your work.<br />This DVD is definitely in my collection.
B000021YQV|2.0|System of a Down's debut album seemed hopeful.  An unique sociopolitical hardcore album with a bit of room for improvement.  Unfortunatly the improvement never came.  The follow up album, Toxicity, contains a few singles and simple filler tracks.  The political lyrics suggested by the band title have been toned down (probably to broaden the audience) as well as the rock.  Very disappointing.
6304698542|2.0|The 2003 DVD re-release of Cabaret is just a re-packaging of the original DVD. Though the new package details state that it is \\"enhanced for 16 x 9,\\" this DVD is a non-anamorphic, matted widescreen presentation. So if you were thinking of trading up to this new edition of Cabaret for your new widescreen TV, hold on to your money. I was not so fortunate. I now have two copies of Cabaret with lousy transfers. Whats up with Warner? They screwed up the release of Giant also. This film is a classic and deserves better treatment.
B00008S2VG|5.0|this album is atrue album of madonna. all of the songs are good and powrefull. the best songs are american life, nobody knows me, mother and father, hollywood, die another day and nothing fails- this song is theeeeeeeee beeeeest sssooonggg you have ever herd. when you buy this album listen to nothing fails first. so by this album you wont be sorry.
B000002WYT|5.0|I've just recently gotten into DMB, and &quot;Crash&quot; is the whole reason.  The songs are beautiful and catchy, and the lyrics are very intelligent.  Some of them are bittersweet like &quot;#41&quot;, others soft like &quot;Crash&quot;, and a few optimistic like &quot;Two Step&quot; but all of them are absolutely amazing.  If you're looking for something to make you feel like you're floating, make you feel like you want to dance, go for this one because in my opinion, it's the best Dave Matthews Band album out so far.
0790729393|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  A superb cast, Robert DeNito shines through even though he has a rather small part.  The story is poignant. And even though at the end,the boys did get their revenge, you realize that they have been scarred for life anyway.
B000002H72|5.0|Everyone has a particular album,tape or CD that becomes engrained into one's life with such brillance that its wake is as fresh as that first memory of eating ice cream. \\"Doolittle\\"knocked me on my [backside] in college back in 1989 with such greatness that I went through three cassettes(one eaten by the car tape deck,another loaned and never returned.I still have the third somewhere)after my friends and I would listen to this every day.Before class,during class and before I went out,the Pixies was lodged in my Walkman/stereo and didn't leave it for about two months.You really can't go wrong with a band that Nirvana repeatedly mentioned as a major creative influence.How can one not be immediately sold by the album's first song\\"Debaser\\"? Black Francis's and Joey Santiago's guitar work is sharp,noisy and beautifully cacophonic.Kim Deal's bass & backing vocals puts a little softness into the mix but still keeps the groove going.Plus,David Lovering's drumming is even tighter than usual thanks to producer Gil Norton.The first half is so catchy it almost simlilar to listening to the Beach Boy's \\"Pet Sounds\\". And just when you think they've slowed down for the rest of the album,in comes \\"Crackity Jones\\"thrashing away with total punk abandon.By the final song,\\"Gouge Away',you'll be almost stunned by the fact that this CD is so brief(just under 40 min)At the end of the day,\\"Doolittle\\"was the Pixies watermark.It's a great primer for first-time listeners(along with the Death to the Pixies compilation)and a must own for every music fan.If you throw this CD in your CD player with ANY albums from Husker Du,Firehose or Galaxie 500,you've got the makings of a good 80s indie rock party mix.I have to agree with some of the other reviewers on one point:if you get \\"Doolittle\\" and the previous two albums(Come On Pilgrim & Surfer Rosa)you've pretty much have all you need from the group. The two albums that followed\\"Doolittle\\"aren't bad but by the time thier swansong\\"Trompe Le Monde\\"cameout,one can since things were slightly off.
B000002A3T|5.0|Contrary to what you may have read, anyone with an open mind would qualify this Pink Floyd album as great as any other. <BR>It has been long since Roger Waters left the band (and very long since Syd did, so please focus), and, therefore, one cannot expect the music to still be the same. Bands always evolve, specially throughout 30 something years. Some evolve for good, some don't. Sometimes, they drastically change their style, most of them in hopes of commercial success. Anyway, I think we can be sure that the least reason Pink Floyd had for taking out a new album was getting richer. <br />Instead, they must have felt sure that they could create a new album without ignoring the Pink Floyd trademark sound. That is basically what this album is, modern Pink Floyd in its best. Please don't expect epic lyrics like those from the 70's (though the ones provided are not bad at all). And surely, don't expect a great concept album that will make you change your attitude towards life. After all, these guys are musicians, and that is what musicians do, music.<br />Anyone with the slightest musical sense towards the work of Pink Floyd should find this album to be a masterpiece. Since the opening track, the band introduces us to their musical environment: calm, inspired, sentimental, reflexive... <BR>All in all, the musical highlights, in a pure sense, are &quot;Cluster One&quot;, &quot;Marooned&quot;, and &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot;. <br />Speaking about &quot;Marooned&quot;, I believe David Gilmour is a highly underrated guitar player, and this track definetely supports my opinion. I don't think many guitar players in the world can play that song. <br />At least 4 other tracks are definetely Floydian, too. And if you have a thing for lyrics, there are a couple more that might strike you.<br />It's a shame too many 'fans' have denied the existence of Pink Floyd beyond Roger Waters, and it's a shame too, that most so-called critics underrated this album; but, hey, how many among those know a bit of music? Most of them just found the subject that would help them write their review: Pink Floyd is not the same without Roger Waters. Of course it isn't! How can it be?<br />In conclusion, don't look for timeless lyrics and stunning concepts; leave that for the writers and poets. If you have been able to understand the musical complexity behind Pink Floyd's work, and don't think that Roger Waters WAS Pink Floyd, then you should have already bought this album.
B00005R8GU|5.0|If you're into the blues, you must have this CD.  It's that good.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is great. It has good pop beats and an R&amp;B flavor to it.Also you are not all as fortunate as me, but i will say she is definatly a pleasure in bed, and shes wild to. I f**k her everynight so if you want to know what her pu**y is like just ask, but I think its great. Peace, sincerely  The Beyonce F**ker!!!
0316666343|4.0|First of all, the narrator is the dead Susie Salmon. She was killed. From the heaven above, she supposedly tells the story while watching her family and close friends on earth. Reminds me of the movie 6th Sense. OK don't read it if you couldn't bear that idea.<br />This is exactly what makes the book interesting. She could see everything, things seem to be so close, but she couldn't do anything. Helpless. As the story unfolds in a remarkably descriptive way, the suspense continues. My heart reaches for those girls with similar fate, and especially the families. I wish the truth would be disclosed and everybody gets what (s)he deserves. A closure.<br />But no, this is a different story.  What we want is not exactly what we need.
B00009P1O0|4.0|I am so happy to finally see this album released on CD.  While it may not have originally gained much critical acclaim, it was always one of my favorite Neil Young releases.  Amulance Blues is one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard.  And some of the lines in Revolution Blues are funny and scary at the same time.  This album and the other recently released albums (Hawks and Doves, American Stars and Bars and Reactor) are not for a casual Neil Young fan.  But, if you have acquired the taste for Neil, you will definitely want these albums
B00005JMCR|5.0|Where were Oz, Vicki, Jessica, and the others?!?! I understand Nadia mot being there--after all she was a foreign exchange student. But Oz was part of Jim's inner circle so to speak. If they weren't going to be in the movie, then at least mention where they are at!!! Outside of that complaint (which I could not get rid of the entire movie) this movie is absolutely hilarious!! From the opening \\"under the table\\" scene to Stifler and his \\"chocolate truffle\\" this movie is filled with more of the gross humor that so many (myself included) love. This movie, like the previous one, also has a great deal of heart. Michelle is more of a background character, but she still has her moments (like talking to Jim's dad before the ceremony). Jim seems to grow out of his clumsiness as the movie goes on. Even Stiffler (who steals the show again!!!) grows up a little and shows even he has a heart. Disapointing about Oz and the other missing characters, but that still does not keep me from giving this movie 5 stars. American Pie 2 is one of my favorite movies of all time; this one lives up to those standards wonderfully.
0451527046|2.0|I read the story of  Long John Silver (supposedly written by himself) written by Bjorn Larsson that is a wonderful story, but at the end of this book it says that if you want to read the last attack of Long John Silver you have to read Treasure Island because if it was written once he will not write it again, that's why I had to read this book.<br />This book has about 300 pages or so, but it goes out of the main story so many times that you don't remember the story, compared with the story of  Long John Silver this book has nothing to do.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Before I begin, I must say that I am not a lover of action movies. However, I consider The Matrix to be one of the best films I saw in 1999.  Along with movies like Minority Report, The Matrix manages to be much more than an action movie. The original film provides enough fodder for philosophical discussions to last for years, but sadly I cannot say the same of The Matrix Reloaded.<br />Due to the success of the first film, I assume the sequel probably had a much larger budget. But it is obvious that the money was spent toward special effects and action scenes rather than developing a script as thought-provoking as the first. The minor philosophical issues raised by characters like the Architect and Merovingian are painfully boring to sit through. These scenes attempt to cram as much philosophical discussion in the shortest amount of time so that the film might move on to the next action sequence. And while some of these action sequences are stunning--as most people have mentioned, the car chase is brilliant--many of them fail to blend CGI effects into live action footage very successfully. Therefore, several times I felt as I though I was watching someone play a video game rather than watching a film. The Wachowskis also put themselves in a difficult position because of Neo's seeeming invincibility in the Matrix. Since Neo can manipulate the Matrix any way he chooses, the action sequences involving Neo have the most possibility of being spectacular. But since Neo can manipulate the Matrix any way he chooses, the audience feels safe that he will not die and, therefore, little dramatic tension is created. Fights involving Morpheus and Trinity have dramatic tension because they do not have the same control of the Matrix as Neo does, but those action sequences will not be as spectacular as Neo's.<br />As far as the plot is concerned, the film doesn't seem to follow through with it. At the beginning of the film, the machines are going to attack Zion and at the end of the film, the machines have still yet to attack Zion. The Matrix Reloaded felt like the first two and half hours of a five hour film, which will be continued when Revolutions comes out. The script also fails to provide any real character development, especially for the new characters.
031286504X|5.0|I was turned on to Matheson after watching Charlton Heston in the Omega Man years back, the movie based loosely upon the book, I Am Legend.  You may find that the only regret from reading I Am Legend is the length of the story:  It leaves you aching for more.  What is particularly remarkable about Matheson is that he can compose a truly compelling story in so few pages, as he deftly details the tribulations of the last man alive in the world...or is he?  Combining interpretations of vampire lore with an excellent interweaving of science fiction, Matheson achieves in his one main character greater fulfillment of plot, tension and irony than many horror or sci-fi authors are able to gain with a full cast.  Positively riveting and fear inspiring, Matheson appeals to the reader emotionally as well:  The chapter involving the protagonist and his relationship with a stray dog is heart breaking, but is evidence of what a truly fantastic author can do with the right material.  Oh, and the killer ending....if you can't see this bittersweet conclusion play out in your mind's eye like a motion picture, you need to read this story again.  Simply the best.
B000002J1B|5.0|I saw the Relayer tour twice in 75-76 and met the band in Cleveland at the hotel bar and got their autographs. Roger and Martyn Dean did the stage set and it was unreal. The combination of the music with the set made for an indescribable concert experience. The music is (as many have described it) violent but in a great way. I highly recommend this album for anyone who likes great intense music.
6301763041|5.0|i first watched this movie when i was six years old and i loved it i would not stop watching it but because it was taped from the telle it went all funny so i had to throw it away which was horrible but my grandma promised me she would buy it on video for me but when i found out that they dont sell it in the uk no more i was soooooooooo mad so iv bin searching to web ever since and now im 14 and iv never got over loving that movie and i never will
B00009RGBS|5.0|This musical deserves 10 stars ********** but they made me stop at 5.  Catherine Zeta Jones does an impressive job as Velma.  Her strong personality suits the character to a T and her voice is made for the stage.  I can't stop singing &quot;And All That Jazz&quot;!  <br />The particular scene in which Roxie (Zellweger) shoots Fred is so well acted that I wanted to shoot him too...that jerk!  Zellweger delivers a stellar performance as dreamer Roxie.  Her seeming innocence is acted out well, and perfectly suited for &quot;oh so naive&quot; looking Renee.  She gives her best performance though when she is singing &quot;Nowadays&quot;.  We all knew she could act, but who knew she could sing? <br />Queen Latifa as &quot;Momma&quot; had one of the best songs in the whole musical with &quot;When your good to Momma&quot;.  And boy can she belt it!! Richard Gere was made for Broadway and it shows as he &quot;tap dances&quot; around the issues, but he does his best as a ventriliquist (however you spell it) in &quot;We both reached for the Gun&quot;.<br />Overall a wonderful show with a great cast!  Excellent, a must see for everyone!!
B000089RVX|4.0|There are two European bands leagues ahead of them and yet the ONLY reason this band is becoming huge is because they're from America.  Like this then you NEED to give Lullacry and Nightwish a listen.  They will absolutely floor Evanescence.  Don't get me wrong this album is good and it's a great commercialization piece to bring Goth more to the masses.  And yes, this is the new Goth, and it's getting so much better.  See the last three albums by Therion for a more melancholy approach to the new sound that will hopefully sweep over this country.
B00004Z459|5.0|It's amazing how long I've had this disc, and I can still throw it in and listen to it if i don't know what to listen to. The music is meaninful, melodic, angsty, everything a teen through adult needs to vent. They don't stoop to using profanity to make themselves cool, their thoughtful lyrics and awesome guitar riffs just make you want to keep listening. I don't know why a lot of people have personal grudges against this band, if you don't like the type of music that's fine, but it doesn't mean they're not a talented band. Give this disc, or their new album Meteora a spin in your cd player and you'll be singing, rapping, and screaming along in no time.
B000002W9P|4.0|On of the greatest albums of from this band, Keeper 1 ranks up there with it's follow up album, Keeper Part 2. The gutiar and vocal work are terrific. The band seem to be in good form musically. Tracks like Halloween and Future World are Great examples of what a power metal song should sound like. A little time is another great for this CD. I fully believe no Power Metal collection is complete without Keeper of the Seven Keys part 1.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album was released just in time to help me vent through some bad times, and it was the perfect disc to do so. Songs like &quot;don't stay&quot;, the heavy guitar of &quot;hit the floor&quot;, and chester's insanely strong voice in &quot;lying from you&quot; are sure to get you pumped, while &quot;numb&quot; and &quot;breaking the habit&quot; and &quot;easier to run&quot; are great in a slower more dramatic sense. &quot;Nobody's listening&quot; is another cool song with Mike following in the footsteps of &quot;it's goin' down&quot; or &quot;high voltage&quot;. I hear people complaining that it &quot;sounds the same as ht&quot; and similar stuff, but each song on this album has great lyrics to relate to and awesome guitar riffs and samples, and in reality, they don't sound the same at all. (unless you're not really paying any attention) The album is a bit short, but so was their debut disc. It's also nice to be able to be able to listen to an album the whole way through without getting bored, or having to go do something else. Short quality is better than long boredom. You should seriously consider buying this album if you're a fan of rock (especially if you enjoyed hybrid theory)
1576751988|3.0|In &quot;Eat that Frog,&quot; motivational speaker and author Brian Tracy supplies 21 recommendations for better time management to be more productive with less procrastinating.  Although it took me over a year to actually get around to reading this book after I purchased it, once I had read it I found it to be both entertaining and helpful. The clever theme from which the title is derived is the premise that if you start your day by &quot;eating a live frog&quot; you know that the most unpleasant part of the day is behind you. By metaphor, the same principle applies if you tackle the most difficult or unpleasant task of the day first.  These tend to be the most important tasks, but often the very same tasks that we avoid or procrastinate upon.  Since nothing is gained by staring at the frog, you might as well eat and get it over with.  This cutesy presentation is actually amusing and entertaining and makes for light and enjoyable reading. Although much of what the author presents is rather intuitive and obvious, such as breaking large daunting tasking into multiple smaller and more manageable tasks, the reader inspired to read this material will find additional motivation within its pages. Since reading the book about six months ago, I have been more productive at tasks that I NEED to do, but don't WANT to do.  Simple advice is often the best advice.
6305531412|5.0|This is a wonderful movie; funny, clever, a perfect blend of live action and animation: a definite family favorite. But beware: you'll be moved to tears by the single most hideous act of cruelty I've ever seen portrayed in any film. The horrible villain takes this poor, defenseless, meek and adorable animated rubber shoe...and....he....I can hardly write it....*sniff* Oh god, he.....dips...him in this...this...awful, wretched vat of....of...well, and he, then he...m...melts him!!!! Oh my god, he just heartlessly melts the little shoe right there!!! And the shoe is alive!! It's the saddest sight I've ever witnessed. And deeply disturbing. You'd think, \\"Oh, it's just an animated character in a kids' movie,\\" but it's not, that moment really has this sick, depraved, twisted quality about it that makes you want to retch and kill the villain at the same time. Ever since I was little I dreaded that one point in the movie. The rest of it is very, very good.
0375414053|5.0|The book is indeed a poignant story of a working Mom who tries everything under the sun to make her family happy. It starts off very funny but slowly evolves into a poignant tale. The author, Allison Pearson, has a talent for story-telling and has done a wonderful job in just her first book. Definitely worth owning!
B000002UUX|5.0|this is the best megadeth album . probably the best metal album ever to me. all the track is awesome.dave mustaine proof he is the greatest rythem guitarist ever and friedman solo in this album is just amazing. THIS IS WORTH BUYING!<BR>the hint to make this cd even more great is u need to play the cd loudly
1573301051|5.0|Mariah shines a 100 times brighter than all the other song birds! this dvd is worth your money only becuase of the amazing lady!
B000002H97|2.0|this is my first metallica album and i'm not a huge fan of metallica , i bought it just to listen to enter sandman(many years back when i'm still new for metal music).well this album is metallica best selling but  far from their best album. but to me sales doesnt saying much, especially talking about about quality. even n sync &amp; backstreet boys debut album can sold more 10 million, so figure out yourself. me myself never like this album much.i dont know why,but i like some of the track like nothing else matter and of wolf and man.there's no really fast songs on this album. the coolest track is probably enter sandman &amp; wherever i may roam. some other songs are m,ore like filler to me.tracks like ,the god that falied,dont tread on me, through the never,my friend mysery  are nothing special to me.  overall this is worth buying though.this album still much better then their next release LOAD and the horrible st anger. i dont like this album not because it's not fast, but most of the songs sounds boring to me. judge it yourself after buying it
0385504209|5.0|This book is my first introduction to a \\"religious\\" themed novel and it worked wonder. The story packed a lot of insgihts I didn't know about, which only made reading each page that much more interesting. I also like the brisk pace of the novel. Dan Brown sure knows how to crank it up. Overall, the story is tight, intelligent, and cleverly interwoven, with a villain who turned out to be someone whom I wasn't quite expecting. Definitely read it. It actually peaked my interest in iconography and rekindled my fascination with Leonardo Da Vinci. Well worth the read.
B000002UUX|5.0|megadeth best album! just listen to first track holywars. it simply amazing, great intro , tight riff , doublebass and great solos. the whole album are just great . all track has an awesome solos buy both marty &amp; dave.buy this album and you wont be disappointed!
B0000A4GAK|5.0|This is my favorite Derek Trucks Band CD so far. Recorded before Joyful Noise this release is all instrumental except for 1 song (sung by guest Gregg Allman). I can play this CD over and over. This band is terrific!
B0000640VO|5.0|I loved the look of the film.  Nice surprises throughout without being jarring and heavy-handed.  The music is wonderful.  I bought the DVD and watch it often.  With the subtitles off, I can practice hearing French.  I recommend this film highly.  Also the special features and the little bits about how it was made are very interesting.  The interview with the director was enjoyable and sweet.
0676973779|5.0|The Life of Pi was a truly refreshing novel to read. Aside from the fact that the author tells a great tale, with quite the entertaining protagonist, the quality of the writing is what I enjoyed the most. The descriptions within the novel are fantastic. The imagery that the author projects though his writing is so vivid and inspiring, that I felt transported within the novel. Since I ordered this novel a few months ago, I've lent it to so many people I still havn't recieved it back yet! Everyone loved it and are considering buying it even though they've already read it. If you're looking for a different kind of read, I recommend this novel. It is so adventurous you'll feel like you're eleven again reading your first adventure novel! Enjoy!!
B000002H2H|5.0|This CD was the best of Metallica! Lars is a great drummer, James is a great guitar player, Kirk is a great guitar player, and Jason is a great bass player! Put these guys together and you get your head blown off by great music! YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD!!!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I am very impressed with this wonderful album. Pink shows great maturity as an artist by co-producing the album and co-writing most of the songs.  This album is very personal and while it's a little depressing, the beats are great and there enough happy songs to make you smile.  I never liked Pink because I thought her music was too slow ( I didn't know what R&B was).  I had gotten sucked in to the Britney stuff (forgive me, I was 10).  When I heared \\"Get the party started\\" on the radio, I didn't believe it was Pink.  Unfourtunately, it seems to me that Pink is underated, despite the fact that all four singles from \\"M!ssundaztood\\" did great.  Avril Lavigne is way overated (her songs are nice but not fantastic).  Sorry,  being ugly and having a bad attitude does not make you punk or the anti-Britney.  Fortunately, Christina Aguilera (who is a lot like Pink) is doing very well.  Hopefully, Pink's third album (out in November) will kill Avril's second.
0385504209|2.0|Having read the reviews, and being interested in alternate, \\"esoteric\\" history, I looked forward to The Da Vinci Code. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I found it predictable, somewhat cliche in its plot devices, and at points the thoughts and actions of the characters seemed absurd. Brown's writing was plodding and uninspired with occasional florid moments. Obviously, my opinion is in the minority, so you may still enjoy it.<br />A pivotal choice that Robert made led to a transparent, over-used plot device. Sophie's \\"shock\\" that caused a 10-year rift in her relationship with her grandfather was just not credible. A woman of her age, background, and intelligence would have been more likely to have listened to, perhaps demanded, an explanation from her grandfather, not hidden from it. One other small, but typical, event also made me roll my eyes: experts were looking at some strange writing that looked familiar, but they couldn't place it. This group included an otherwise brilliant cryptologist, but they did not recognize it--I am no expert, but I would have recognized it out of context if I'd just happened upon it on the street. I'd go into more detail, but can't put in anything that would give away too much plot. Hope this helps someone avoid the disappointment and expense of buying this book!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Britney, I hate you.  Thanks to you, we have \\"singers\\" like Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, and Hilary Duff.  Thanks to you, people who write a few words on their lyrics And \\"play\\" a guitar are considered deep (cough, cough, Avril).  However, Britney did one good thing.  She made Christina Aguilera look like a puppet.  Christina got her revenge.  She shocked the nation by stripping off all (or most) of her clothes and released a personal, mature and completely rockin' album.  If you do not like her new image, don't be too skeptical as her CD is not quite so raunchy (some tracks are a little innapropriate for the twelve and under group).  But hey, she's  a heck of a lot more appropriate than Eminem, who, by the way, is what your twelve year old is probably listening to at this very moment.  In conclusion, \\"Stripped\\" worthy of purchasing (heck, the pictures in the booklet are worth thirteen bucks).  \\"Fighter\\" should be dedicated to Britney.
B0000024SI|4.0|Considering that this album is the result of six constant days of jamming and recording that Dylan did with these guys walking into the studio without one single song written, this album is phenomenally good--you could almost call it a miracle. Dylan is Dylan here about as good as he ever was, though the lyrics today sound a lot less psychedelic and an awful lot dirtier than they did then. Bloomfield's guitar is tastefully lyrical on &quot;Like A Rolling Stone,&quot; and burns like hell-fire on &quot;Tombstone Blues,&quot; which alone is worth the price of the album (however, I'd also say that about Dylan's lyrical majesty here on &quot;Desolation Row&quot;--easily his best lyrics ever. Kooper provides sympathethic organ as only he can, and Bloomfield's guitar backing is a graceful, lyrical, and gutsy as can be, as the need requires. This is a much better album then Blonde On Blonde because of Bloomfield and Kooper's presence here, but the songs on Blonde On Blonde are much better. The reason that Bloomfield and Kooper were replaced by The Band was that Bloomfield was touring with both Dylan and Butterfield in-between, and when Dylan's manager insisted that he tour with with either one band or the other,  Bloomfield chose TO TOUR WITH BUTTERFIELD INSTEAD OF DYLAN! It's a great thing for fans of Bloomfield's guitar playing that he did, but you just can't help but wonder what Blonde On Blonde would have sounded like witth Bloomfield and Kooper on board. It would have been awesome. I wouldn't call this a great album, but it sure is pretty damn good, and very probably Dylan's best.
B00003CXXS|1.0|Besides the fact that this movie is incredibly short there are horrible plot holes.  Why on Earth is there a new Dinosuar wouldn't we have heard about it in the previous movies?  He kills T-rex right when we see them but if he was so superior He would have killed him a long time ago.  All of the people get killed in the first few minutes.  After that no one dies how is that suspenseful?  The Veloceraptors talk too.  This movie is very poorly written.  It is as if the producers walked in and said &quot;new dinosaur, veloceraptors talk, nobdy important dies; run with it&quot;
B0000024U8|4.0|If you want Bloomfield's best blues, and jazziest, most soulful, most lyrical album, then this is your Holy Grail. With the passage of time some things wear thin, like Kooper's vocals on &quot;Man's Tempation&quot;, the tape-whoosh dual-flanger effect on &quot;You Don't Love Me,&quot; and the overkill of the 15-minute &quot;Season of the Witch,&quot; but &quot;Harvey's Tune&quot; (with no guitar!) is a beautiful, soulful, lovely jewel of a song, and Stills' guitar-work on &quot;It Takes A Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot; and &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; are first-rate, with Stills sounding an awful lot like Jimi Hendrix on the latter tune, which really deserves that treatment. In the end though, the more you listen to it, the more beautiful Bloomfield's playing becomes on soulful tunes like &quot;Really&quot; (and if you like this tune you should buy Barry Goldberg's Two Jews Blues just for &quot;Blues For Barry And&quot; with Bloomfield on it). Bloomfield's best straight-ahead blues is  &quot;Albert's Shuffle,&quot; and the beauty and creative lyricism (as well as the speed) of his jazz improvisation on &quot;His Holy Modal Majesty&quot; is breathtaking--it absolutely must be heard to be believed. And on every second of this album, Kooper's organ is just as beautiful, exquisite and soulful as Bloomfield's guitar. His organ playing is truly one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It's such a dirty rotten shame that this didn't turn out to be Bloomfield's first solo album, as Kooper had planned it. But considering each side of the album was cut with in only one day with Bloomfield and only one day with Stills, this album is a genuine miracle!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am constantly playing this in my car. Awesome album to sing along to, I can't wait for her next album to come out!!! One of my favorite albums of all time, and there's not too many of those...
B00009MGQL|4.0|If you are looking for something along the lines of Blow by Blow then forget it.  This is something new and different.  Jeff's previous two albums were all about him coming to terms with techno and other types of dance-oriented music; with mixed success.  He hits it with this one.  The beats are great and the guitar playing is jaw-dropping as usual.  He gets a nice snarling, dirty tone out of his Strat, making vigorous use of the wah-wah pedal.  Most of the songs are not characterized by a melody so much as a very basic and simple riff or a sampled vocal, which Jeff then proceeds to turn into a highly bombastic and beat-laden symphony.  A great CD to play in the car.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This is an excellent comedy, I saw it twice at the theater and I have seen it 3 times on DVD. The more you watch it the more things you pick on. I do not own many movies but this is a must in my collection. Vince, Will and Luke are great, so is Juliette Lewis. I have read some of the reviews and I have to agree that the the unrated and out of control part may be misleading to some people. Here is a tip: if you want some good nudity get yourself a girlfriend, if you want to see a funny movie see Old School. Reviewers that did not like this movie should mention other movies that they did like to put things on perspective for the rest of us, if you like movies such as Scary Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, then you've got a problem.<br />If you got through this review you deserve another tip. There is a deleted scene on this DVD that not many know about. Go to &quot;setup&quot; scroll down with the arrows until you highlight &quot;Frank&quot; and click. Voila.
630512762X|5.0|I have seen alot of action movies, and this one of the best of them.  I think this is Woo's best movie also. Travolta and Cage light up the screen with memorable performances, I love their action roles more than all the rest.  The movie has it all: action, drama, depth (good/evil, loss of child), innovation, great musical score, great cinematography.  I'll admit the plot is bit unrealistic, but only if you dwell on it too long, Woo masks the unrealistic plot well. Remember that this is an action movie, not an Academy Award nominee for best picture, so the little plot problems should be excusable and disregarded.  Anybody who criticizes this movie too much has either forgotten that this is a fictional action movie or is insane.  Buy this on dvd if you haven't already, even if you haven't seen it yet.  Its sad that the nineties was the last decade of great action flicks like this, since the new decade hasn't seen really any yet.
B00004YX39|2.0|...makes Gaucho unbearable.  Both Aja and Gaucho have excellent studio production and should be studied by audio engineers (I know I test out stereos using Steely Dan albums).  But the perfectionism that makes Aja so vibrant makes Gaucho seem lifeless by comparison.  There are exceptions, I found Time Out of Mind and Hey Nineteen to be as good as anything on Aja.  But ultimately they are just that, exceptions to the normally bland material.  The only reason I bought this album was to complete my Steely Dan collection; and the only other reason to buy it, Hey Nineteen, is on Classic Rock radio enough that you don't have to spend the money to buy the rest of the album.
B000059HB7|5.0|One of the best John Wayne movies in my opinion with lots of great action, wonderful characters, and the duke at the top of his form.  And the best part is that Warner did a fantastic job on the transfer.  Sound is excellent and the picture is fantastic and enhanced for widescreen, given when this film was made. This one's a no brainer.  Nice work Warner!  Now go get rights to McLintock so it can be done right!
B000002KCC|5.0|This album is perhaps Neil Young's darkest, and most enduring album.  Every track seems to sear itself into your head, plucking at your emotions with ferocity missing on many of his more mellow, country influenced works.  This one is gritty, dirty flame, burning you through and through.
B00005JLSE|5.0|If you missed Chicago in a movie theatre, what a shame: The vibrant colors and flashy editing played a little better on the big screen, but that does not denegrate the value of owning this DVD.  I play the soundtrack CD all the time, and now I can play individual numbers at my whim!  Renee Zellweger, of whom I am no fan, does an excellent job as Roxie Hart, and her singing voice is appropriate for a character who is not supposed to be exceptionally talented anyway.  Richard Gere was completely robbed at the Academy Awards: His Billy Flynn is a sleazy, smarmy antihero for whom we cheer, and he does an excellent job with his singing and dancing, adopting a Jolson-esque singing style very appropriate to the time period.  Queen Latifah proves quite an actress in the non-singing parts, and her solo number is a hoot.  But the real reason to see Chicago is Catherine Zeta Jones.  She is a real hoofer with a great voice to match!  If this had been her debut, it would really have been one of those legendary star-making parts!  (I have started going back to see her past work, and I highly recommend her work in Entrapment with Sean Connery; she's sexy and fab in that tricky little thriller, too.)  The deleted musical number Class is clever, but obviously could not have taken place in this version of the story because Roxie is not present (all the music is in her imagination) and thus was rightly cut. Finally, if you can sit through the Cell-Block Tango number without wanted to applaud afterword, you are hard-hearted indeed!
B00000064G|5.0|Honestly, people always apply this \\"desert island\\" concept to some of their favorite albums. They say that an album like Sgt. Pepper or Are You Experienced would be one of the only albums they'd take with them if they had to abandon all of their possesions and live alone on a desert island. Now, this is not to say that pepper or the experience are bad, they are amazing. But it just wouldn't make any sense to want to listen to hard rock, psychedelic music, pop, or r&b if you were stranded for the rest of your life. On the other hand, an introspective album such as Pink Moon would be the perfect soundtrack to a life of solitude. Therefore, it is my \\"desert island\\" record. Kind of Blue might be nice to listen to on an island as well. Nick Drake is the man, and Pink Moon is the second best album of all time, behind Abbey Road. There's nothing else to it. Go buy it or else nobody will like you and think you're a loser like Duncan Sheik is. And nobody wants to be as wack as Duncan Sheik, ever.
0812550706|5.0|Throughout my life I have read books from every genre of reading known to man.  The latest book, or series, I should say, was by Orson Scott Card.  In my opinion I can honestly say that Card is the greatest author in science-fiction history, and possibly the history of fiction all together.<BR>His ideas are and characters are masterfully drawn, his stories are incredibly captivating, and there is an underlying philosophy throughout every book in the Ender and After Ender series.  <BR>Ender's Game is a wonderfull read, to put it mildly, and will not dissapoint.  I can guarantee you'll finish this book quicker than you've finished any other before, because frankly, you can't put it down.
0805211063|3.0|It is a pity that it wasn't until the book's abrupt end that my interest finally piqued.  So many questions unanswered.  Disappointed with the verbosity and seemingly needless details throughout most of the book, I was suddenly left facing the cliff hanger of all cliff hangers!  The author is dead!  I will never have my pressing questions answered!  It makes me wonder whether Kafka actually meant to do this.  Very sneaky indeed!<br />I know that K. must be Kafka, but what is the Castle?  Acceptance as a Jew in Nazi Germany?  It seems too obvious, but perhaps a simple explanation will suffice.
0393057658|4.0|I read a lot; a lot of different books in a lot of different genres. But I put this and Make every girl want you above all others because both make you think about what you've read. Most books I buy just rehash old info, with a little bit of new stuff. These books, however, make you think about everything in there, and make you question everything you've been taught - this book about baseball, that book about dating. Let's start by saying that Billy Beane is the man. It's unbelievable how Beane used statistical analysis to consistently build winning teams out of players with - for example - high on-base percentages. I am now a huge A's fan, and very excited to follow and root for the A's in the pennant chase over these next few weeks. My only question is why Beane wrote this book. Why Beane felt the need to make such an incredible strategy public knowledge, especially since it works so well.
0440237688|3.0|Summary:<br /> Jonas lives in a community of Sameness, where everything is perfect and setup by meticulous rules. People can't choose their jobs, they're chosen for them. If the child bearers have twins one would have to be \\"released,\\" because it is forbidden to have two of the same person in the community. At the Ceremony of Twelve in December Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver, who is in charge of holding the memories of  life before the community. He works with The Giver, who transmits memories of snow, excruciating pain, love, emotions, and colors; all the things the community doesn't have anymore. With his new role comes new responsibility and new freedom.  Everything is all good for Jonas until he finds out the secrets of the community. Will Jonas be able to handle the memories that unfold or will he just give up?<br />Review:<br /> The beginning was boring but then the book started getting interesting and caught our attention. We found it interesting how there were no feelings, and how the kids weren't able to go through teenage changes. It made us wonder what it would be like not to have feelings. We were fascinated by how the community reproduced. We thought the ending could have been more detailed because we wanted to find out what happened with the community Jonas left behind and wether the community he went to was what he expected. We recommend this book to people of all ages and who are willing to think.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is a great movie, it has action, drama, an interesting plot, good heroes, excellent villains and a great cast. What else do you want.<br />The problem? I think \\"Daredevil\\" is not a character that can become popular such as its counterpart \\"Spiderman\\" and some people aren't moved by the \\"darker\\" side of a superhero but still this is what makes DD an interesting hero.<br />The extras are quite good, specially if you get the 2 DVD Special Edition. The only thing missing is that they should throw a couple of deleted scenes into the mix. There was a scene on the trailer with Coolio and they should put that on the DVD. The audio commentary of the director with one of the producers is so-so, somewhat funny actually, it's the first time I heard a director somehow bashing his own movie...\\"here comes the crappy CGI...\\" you can't get more honesty than that.<br />The movie itself rocks...if you love action movies this one will be entertaining...Where else can you get actors like Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan in the same movie!!! And Farrell is superb as the cold blooded assasin \\"Bullseye\\". Duncan nails the part as the Kingpin very good (specially since the Kingpin is white, but Duncan gets the \\"spirit\\" of the character). Joe Pantoliano and Jon Favreau are also in it and they give an excellent performance. It's strange that Garner wasn't even the 1st choice for the role (that was Bridget Moynahan from \\"The Sum of All Fears\\") but Garner nails the part perfectly as \\"Elektra\\" and she deserves her own movie (some say it's in development). Affleck is not perfect in the main role but still manages to get the job done.<br />Overall from 1 to 5: MOVIE=5 SOUND=5 EXTRAS=4
0425173755|4.0|This particular mystery is actually a little slower and less engaging than other Christie novels. For one thing, the author gives Poirot an ascendant over the supposedly-expert medical examiner on board the train, making the doctor second guess himself a little too often (a nationality bias on Christie's part). Second, the victim is a hated man, making the murder less sensational, but the fact that the train is snowbound and that no one can escape the Express makes for a less-than-exciting notion that the killer is still on board (though everyone acts as if under sedation during their &quot;enforced captivity&quot;). As the mystery is unraveled, the entire truth appears on the instant,  abruptly ending any suspense. This is my 2nd Christie mystery after &quot;Death on the Nile,&quot; a much more gripping book.
B0000640S2|4.0|Rambo II is one of those movies that in a way surpass its predecessor. It's more action oriented but with a somewhat cool plot. The movie itself is one of the most definitive action movies of the 80's. Directed by italian director, George Cosmatos, the movie was the one who put the name &quot;Rambo&quot; in common use in the USA. Also it was written by James Cameron (of the &quot;Terminator&quot; saga and Titanic) and Sylvester Stallone. The hidden subject in this movie is actually the idea of Rambo &quot;winning&quot; the vietnam war but there is more to it. When this movie opened in 85, the Cold War was as its best. Reagan used this movie to put himself into the &quot;rambomania&quot; frenzy, we all know that Reagan use all the media at his disposal but that's another story whatsoever.<br />The movie is rated R for violence mostly, there are a couple of bad words and blood but teens can get to it without much trouble. The whole idea of the &quot;expendable&quot; issue is a good theme for discussion between parents and kids or teacher and students.<br />Rambo: First Blood Part II (in some countries called &quot;Rambo II: The Mission) now in this DVD format is a definitive movie for the action fan, specially if you are a fan of the 80's movie. This edition has clear image and excellent sound. The process for digitalization of the picture was done perfectly so you won't believe you are actually watching a movie almost 20 years old.<br />The documentary has a lot of cool info, even for those &quot;Rambomania&quot; fans would find this very interesting and with interviews with cast and crew including Stallone, the late Richard Crenna, and others. Also the director Cosmatos and the producers get into the documentary with interesting facts (the idea of pairing Stallone and Travolta as a sidekick was a novelty for me!!!) is a good source for inside info.<br />The trailers (some are TV spots) are also quite good but they haven't been &quot;cleaned up&quot; so they look like they are quite old and the sound in those is not remastered. There's also a section on the stars and the crew with filmography and stuff it's informative but that's it.<br />The extras are good. It would be fun if they throw a lot of deleted scenes into it, but there isn't. The audio commentary of Cosmatos is so-so there aren't much there either.<br />Finally I must say this edition contain both the widescreen version and the full screen version so you can go wrong there. The movie comes with subtitles in spanish for both versions.<br />From 1 to 5: Movie=4, Sound Quality=5, Video Quality=5, Extras=3.ey are quite old and the sound in those is not remastered. There's also a section on the stars and the crew with filmography and stuff it's informative but that's it.<BR>The extras are good.

This movie has Classic scenes, unforgettable moments and most of all laughs....Dont let this movie/dvd slip away...
0345350499|5.0|I have always loved the story of King Arthur, and to hear if from the woman's point of view was fascinating.  It really showed a side of King Arthur that we may miss if we were listening to a &quot;guys&quot; telling of the story.  I have to admit, Morgaine fascinated me!  She was so different from what I have come to expect of women back in the days of Knights!  She actually was more like women of today, trapped in the past.  I think that of all the women of Avalon.  Then, there is the Queen's wife!  I spent the whole book wishing she was not alive.  She has to be the most annoying person in the world, I am sorry!  She needs to go away.  Everyone else lived up to my expectations.  I am just glad that I discovered this book, it opened new doorways for me, that's for sure!
B00000J6AG|5.0|I bought Moby's Play with only hearing South Side on the radio a few times. Little did I know that after listening to the entire album that South Side would be one of my least favorite tracks on the album. Play is the one cd I own that I can listen to over and over without getting track skip happy. My favorite tracks on the album are: Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?, Rushing, If Things Were Perfect, Everloving (favorite track on cd), Guitar Flute &amp; String, and The Sky Is Broken. Overall, Moby's PLAY is the greatest album I own.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I give The Matrix Reloaded four stars for brilliant special effects, great characters and a good storyline, even though some of the mystery was taken away. The Wachowski brothers must have done some serious brainstorming to figure out how to top The Matrix. They didn't top it, but they delivered a satisfactory sequel.<BR>Unlike a lot of other reviewers here, I loved the fight scenes, even the long skirmish between Neo and Agent Smith. They kept upping the ante, testing each other's limits. They don't seem to have found any yet, but they have a measure of each other. It gives us a good foretaste of their own personal armageddon.<BR>The biggest problems for me were the scenes of Zion. It was partly what I imagined, and then a whole lot of what I didn't imagine. Aside from taking away the mystery of the last refuge of humanity, the Wachowskis added some quite ludicrous scenes to the mythology. The pointed effort to make Zion a PC melting pot was one of them. Do Neo, Morpheus, etc. go out of their way to free a representative number of races???<BR>The other unnecessary thing in the Zion scenes was the religious service. Granted, there already was a philosophical/religious theme in the Matrix that contributed to its appeal, but the orgy-like dance party was just silly. It looked like an ecstasy-fueled rave, or an ancient pagan worship rite. Like a fellow viewer commented, it made me feel these are not people worth saving, let the machines have 'em!<BR>Fortunately, the directors redeemed the rest of the movie with continuing good action, some great new characters (the programs, not the humans) and further mind-blowing revelations in the dialogue with the Architect. Looking forward to a smashing finish.
B00009P1O0|5.0|&quot;Walk On&quot; was the hit from this LP, but it was the rest of the album that created that blue-stoned atmosphere that made this offering one to roll another number and contemplate the meaning of Neil's message. You'll know what I mean as soon as &quot;See the Sky about to Rain&quot; gets going. &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; is one of the most angry songs that Neil has ever made and a great rocker. All the other songs carry the general mood till it's end when Neil tells us we've been &quot;pissing in the wind&quot;. &quot;Vampire Blues&quot; is just as fitting today as it was in 1974. The cover to this album is a classic-with Neil walking away from the headlines of Nixon resigning-the passing of an era- our so we thought. The only criticism is the length of the LP. It's still one of my favorites.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I am one of the few people I know who actually thought The Matrix Reloaded was a great movie.  The action is mind blowing the story though slow at times answered questions left by the first movie, and the overall feel of the movie was simply electric.  <br />The key to enjoying this movie is to forget about the first movie's insane special effects and rave reviews.  Because although this movie has the best action sequences I've ever seen they aren't that much more insane than the first movie's action sequences.  I think the reason so many people were disappointed with this movie is simply because they were expecting the impossible which is a sequal that has action scenes exponentially better than the first movie, plus a plot that is as fresh and innovative as the first movie.  Look the first movie introduced a whole new way of filming an action movie, you can't expect the sequal to be just as fresh it's just not possible!<br />Bottomline is in my opinion this movie is just as good if not better than the first one and though many may say otherwise it is still an awsome movie that is ten times better than any other action movie out there.  Don't give this movie the cold shoulder just because of the reputation it's prequal has.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I've been following Neil Young's career for well over thirty years. I'm not a casual fan. That being said, I've been critical of his sub-par outings, Most of his Geffen recordings and last years clunker &quot;Are you passionate&quot;. This offering may be Neil's most ambitious work ever. It could be called a concept album, but I think it's more than that. It's a social commentary using a make-believe town and it's very believable characters to reflect on many of the issues that face the people of our generation today. I saw Greendale performed at Red Rocks with his cast of characters and the ever reliable Crazy Horse. What a powerful performance (Hopefully, a DVD of the show is coming). You can't help but see Eagle county, Colorado in the scene were grandpa faces down the media. It's not my place to recap the story that is Greendale. I would encourage those of you who enjoy the passion that Neil exhibits in his best work both in powerful lyrics and the electric rock of Crazy Horse to set aside 78 minutes to absorb this offering without interuption. Like all of Neil's work it comes off best when performed live-that being said I believe this work may be Neil's most complete album-It raises the bar to his contemporaries. Courageous effort Neil-Keep on Rockin in the Free World!
B00005JLSE|5.0|I can't say enough,i watched it twice after recieving it! It almost rules the genre of historical musicals along with moulin rouge and gangs of new york(although granted not much of a musical). The songs and scenery, costum, and order of appereance were fantastic. As a movie it was exceptional- as a broadway show i am truly at a loss for words, with a cast of gold and a plot proven popular it truly comes out on top! Extra information and songs on the DVD promote it even further...worth the money and time! if you dont love it you hate it but if you love it you'll never put it away!
B00002MZ4V|4.0|Excellent sound quality, great composer, BUT... ***On what other &#34;greatest hits&#34; cd do the artists re-record the material? The music is faster, has less emotional impact, and actually has emphasis on different notes and phrases. This has the same impact of a child whistling the tunes, just running through it. The really bad thing about all of this is that the tunes you bought this for sound the worst, because you're expecting something totally different.  ******************** Sometimes sounds counterfeit.  Still, this has excerpts from some great music scores and can still be enjoyed.  Sounds better the second time around. ******** It is sounding better and better.

0385504209|1.0|This is NOT an \\"intelligent and lucid thriller.\\"  The materail about the Grail Myth is okay, the symbolic interpretaitions of famous works of art and lit are okay, but after that, the book is just plain dull.  The characters are flat, cardboard figures.  The plot is a maze of coincidences and last second, farfetched solutions to unbelievable problems, as though the author is just making things up as he goes along.  The writing plods forward. I believed the hype.  You'd think I was old enough to know better.

076781326X|2.0|I purchased this DVD in the hope of re-living the magic from my childhood!  I am not a technical expert, but the sound quality for both the dialogue and especially the music (5.1 dolby digital) was so bad that I am going to return this and wait for an updated version.  This movie won Oscars for sound and music back then, and they totally blew it on this one.
6305428050|4.0|Elisabeth plays a cute high school girl waiting for her boyfriend to take her out for the evening.  He comes to tell her a cooked-up story that his little sister is sick with something contageous and he has to stay with her.  So she ends up babysitting instead.  Goofy incident after goofy incident will keep you in tears of laughter.  I especially loved the scene in the &quot;blues&quot; club where they are forced to create their own little song before they can leave.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat as the little girl dangles perilously on the outside of a Chicago skyscraper while their parents party inside.  Ya gotta have a copy of it, DVD preferred.
B00008NRI8|3.0|This is another one of those movies that could have easily been a boring flop had it not been for Hugh Grant.  I've often said that I think Grant has impeccable comedic timing, and this is what saves this movie.<br />This DVD came out around the same time as Maid In Manhattan.  If you could only see one, make it this one -- MIM was a snoozer.  However, that doesn't make this one come out smelling like a rose.  The premise wasn't bad -- Sandra Bullock plays a Birkenstock wearing lawyer who is not at all caught up in the trappings of success (largely b/c she has no $$), but winds up working for an irreverent, playboy executive in an attempt to save a building in her neighborhood.  See the movie to see how that transpires exactly.  At any rate, it's a culture clash.  Along the way, love blossoms unbeknownst to either party until the end ... of course.  The movie is predictable, but again, Hugh's humor saves the day.  While Bullock comes off as whiney much of the time, she garners just enough sympathy and has enough beauty to pull it off.  Hugh is the star of this show though.  It seems right up his alley to play the suave, albeit shallow, playboy (About A Boy, Nine Months, etc.), so he plays it well.  We should be disgusted by him right along with Bullock, yet he's endearing and likable as ever.  And his quips and one-liners really hit the mark.<br />Bottom line:  Don't go into this movie expecting a laugh-fest, but do expect Grant's consistent and ongoing comedic flair.  Don't go into this movie expecting a warm and fuzzy Kate and Leopold-esque feeling, but do expect to root for Bullock at least over her sleazy adversary.  Rent it first, before you opt to buy.
B00009W0U4|5.0|IRREVERSIBLE starts off with erratic nervous energy and nearly unbearable violence, which unwinds (since the plot presents the story in reverse) to a meditative, mandala-like epiphany.  Hard to say whether the story would have worked as well chronologically (I doubt it), but as it is, the film comments intelligently on revenge, masculinity/femininity, the sex-and-violence connection, and, most of all, the vanity of human wishes.  The highlights of the film are two long and excrutiating scenes of brutal violence.  But there are equally impressive quiet moments--such as the desperate and witty subway conversation on what makes for \\"good sex\\" and a tender, matter-of-fact love scene between the film's charismatic stars Vincent Cassel and Monica Belluci, who have never been better.  Any warnings you have received about the ghastliness of the fight scene and rape scene that dominate the film should not be taken lightly.  Still, the film has more to offer than shock effects and gore, and it is as serious a contemplation of the human condition as you are likely to see on film.
B000001G5H|5.0|this is the most beautiful and flawless recording of the etudes op 10 and 12 that a human being can ever hear on a disc. after winning the chopin competition with these etudes in 1960 at the age of 18, his career started, and these etudes represent the maestro signature pieces. don't even think about whether to buy it: you must!
B000056K04|3.0|I am a huge Dave Matthews Band fan.  I own all of their CDs, both studio and live, and I must say, this is by far my least favorite disc of theirs.  Unlike other fans, who didn't even like the melodies and lyrics of the disc, I didn't mind the pop-oriented hooks and less deep lyrics.  However, while listening to other albums by the band, it shows how much more this album could have been.  First of all, where are Boyd [Violin player] and LeRoi [saxophone player]?  The first thing that popped into my mind after hearing the CD is how these two alone could have saved some of these songs.  You get a hint of some bluesy horns near the end of When The World Ends . . . why weren't those used the whole song?  Violin could have greatly enhanced slower songs such as If I Had It All and Sleep To Dream Her.  And on songs like So Right, the possibility for musical jams are so blatantly apparent that you sit there and wonder why the hell the band didn't even think to let those two shine?  But it's not just those two who's skills are missing.  Carter, the drummer, is known for insanely rhythmic drumming and complicated percussion patterns.  On this CD, the drum notes are essentially formulaic pop drum patterns.  <br />Another problem I have with this CD is that when you go to a concert, the songs are tweaked in ways that make them more accesible to the band.  For instance, So Right jams infinitely and the poppy synthesized horns and electronic bleeps are gone.  While paling to some of their other work, it's a welcome addition to a concert.  Which makes me wonder why they didn't play with the songs to give them a more DMB feel.  I think the one thing that supporters of this album say is that fans aren't ready for change, which I do not believe to be true.  The album released before this, Before These Crowded Streets, changed the band's style substantially, but it was good quality music that the band had obviously explored before recording.  Everyday just seems kind of lazy and sloppy in comparison, and pales at what it could have been.  There are highlights though, like So Right, What You Are, When The World Ends and Everyday, which evolved from a classic DMB song #36, so consequently that one song sounds a lot like the old band.  This is an OK CD, and you should purchase it if you liked the singles, but if you want a slightly different DMB get Before These Crowded Streets, and if you want to see poppier music done justice, get Under The Table &amp; Dreaming.  Those two CDs are much better than this one.
B00003CXXM|4.0|The Bourne Identity is a very good and intense movie, but it is not as good as the book.  I had read the book before watching the movie and was disappointed at the things the movie left out.  By the end of the movie you don't even really know if Bourne is a good guy or bad guy.  Never the less it is a great story and an above average movie.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I love this CD!  It's a mixture of Bluegrass and I'm not-sure-what, but the music is great, the musicians are great, and the recording is wonderful.  Alison Krauss is the best singer on earth.
B000002GYW|3.0|The Eagles Desperado is a concept album of the old west.  Many intriguing tales about the untamed west and the many Desperados and Outlaws that roamed Out of Control through such untamed territories like Bitter Creek.<br />Whereas the lyrics are somewhat interesting, musically the recordingis kind of hit nd miss.  I like the opening track, Doolin' Dalton as there are some catchy hooks and some good vocals from Glenn Frey and Don Henley.  Desperado is a pretty much heralded ballad and Out Of Control is a fierce rocker.  Too bad I can barely make out the words that Glenn Frey is singing.<br />There are a few minor drawbacks.  Certain Kind Of Fool has an annoying vocal tone courtesy of Randy Meisner.  Bitter Creek does drag a bit and somehow I would appreciate some more rock n roll numbers.  The pace is a generally slow.<br />Whereas I prefer On The Border, Hotel California, and One Of These Nights, this is overall a decent effort.  I just would not say its quite prime time.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|If you're looking for singable songs that you can play at friendly get-togethers with memorable hooks and quirky wordplay you should pick up Rust Never Sleeps, not Greendale.<br />Young has created with this amazing group of songs such a complex, interesting tale of an American family and town that it almost feels as if should be an independent film or thick novel instead of a music album.<br />Unlike other concept albums, the entire work tells a story with little or no need of a narrative, which Young provides on the companion DVD.  Characters and places appear from song to song, singing of love, murder, drugs and the desire for truth.<br />I can't speak highly enough about this album, but I could understand why people won't like it.  It's too bad if you don't...you're missing a fantastic story.
B000069AUI|5.0|While I will admit I've only recently become a Coldplay fan (never heard any of Parachutes), I've already grown to love them.  The album is incredible and ranges from the angry Politik, to the simple piano of Amsterdam, to the almost folk sounding song Green Eyes.  This album is a must have and you can listen to it over and over again.  <BR>TOP FIVE:<BR>1. Green Eyes- While I originally found this song boring, I've learned to love it and it's become my favorite song on the whole album.  What starts out like a slow folk song slowly grows and about 2/3 of the way into, Chris shows his range and wails like I've never heard before.<BR>2. Amsterdam- This song is so moving yet so simple.  Chris' simple piano playing is at its best in this song and is a wonderful ending to the album.<BR>3. In My Place- This song was what first got me somewhat interested in Coldplay.  Simply a great song.<BR>4. Clocks- Chris' piano playing with his soft voice is soothing.<BR>5. The Scientist- Another great song with Chris' piano playing, and a big hit single.  <br />Coldplay is so talented and they're finally gaining the respect they deserve.

B00005JLSE|5.0|Everyone who hasn't seen this musical, you need too!! Aside from winning several Tony's during it's original run on Broadway with stage legends, Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera, it was and still is an immense success on Broadway right showing off the talents of some more stage greats - Bebe Newwirth, Ann Reinking, and Joel Gray (original Emcee in Cabaret). The movie version upholds to its Broadway prdecessors...It's an amazing story of two infamous women (Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart, Zeta-Jones and Zellweger, respectively) fighting for media publicity and lawayer played wonderfully by Richard Gere (who does his own tap dancing and singing). With musical numbers written brilliantly by John Kander and Frank Ebb that will have your feet tapping in tempo and lyrics that stay in your head, who wouldn't love this musical?! Not too mention choreography inspired by Bob Fosse - you can NOT get any better than Kander&amp;Ebb with Fosse!! &quot;The Cell Block Tango&quot; in itself is totally worth it, as is John C Reily's absolutely amazing &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot;<br />For all those people out there who getting the wrong advice about Moulin Rouge being &quot;sooooo much better&quot; than Chicago, please do not listen. I am a huge musical fan, having performed in several musicals and attending 5 times more at local, regional and broadway theatre, I can safely say that Chicago is far superior to anything that Baz Lurhman may give you. This is not to say that Moulin Rouge was not a great musical - Ewan McGregor was absoultey phenomenal. Kidman, however, is in no comparison whatsoever to Zeta-Jones or Zelleweger (who may not have the greatest sing-songy or trained voice like zeta-jones, but for its character purposes, it is the PERFECT Roxie voice) At least, Zelleweger looked like she had the breathe support and technique to sing, and can belt out some impressive notes for a first time singer. Kidman, though pretty, is nothing special and thousands upon thousands of girls can singjust like here.<BR>Not too mention the story is chicago is actually worth talking and thinking about, compared to the weak and cliched storyline of moulin rouge (you know what's going to happen in the end within the first 10 minutes of the movie - where is the fun in that?!)<br />So please, forget all the awful rumors and stupid advice about Moulin Rouge being the &quot;superior musical&quot; b/c they all obvisouly do not know what they are talking about! Chicago won Tonys AND all its Oscars for excellent reasons of which you can see for yourself if you get this DVD!!! So get it and you'll see what &quot;all that jazz&quot; is really about!!!
B000002ADT|5.0|Whether or not this is the Miles Davis creative peak, commercial peak, or whatever possible pinacle Davis has achieved in his extensive career matters very little to me. I, if you look at my reviews, will show that I am by no means a jazz expert. To be honest, that's fine by me. Most of the time, despite a select few artists, I really do not enjoy jazz mainly do to a) jazz enthusiasts who will try and shove my opinion back down my throat for saying b) that I don't understand the spectacle that is jazz. Musicians excersising their musical profiency does not make for good listening in my opinion. So why in the hell am I writing a review of what is considered one of the best jazz records of all time. Because it transends what makes most jazz, jazz and for one, makes it more accessible to the average listener.<br />Backed by a superb band, Miles Davis across 5 songs(six if you count the alternate take of Flemmingo Sketches) and creates a rich atmosphere not far removed from most ambient music. I know the thought of comparing Miles Davis to the likes of Brian Eno or The Orb might be sickening but that's what I hear. Sure there are musical flurrishes of improv that would make the average proficient musician blush(which I will readidly admit to not being to have the most musicially inclined ear since &lt;insert your favorite composer here. I'll put Gershwin because I enjoy Gershwin quite a bit&gt;) but when it comes down to it, its mainly the music and atmosphere that makes me love Kind of Blue. It actually feels musical rather then musical excerises for jazz musicians. That's why it transends the standard of jazz and becomes one of my favorite albums of all time. Period.

0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead is Ayn Rand's greatest novel, and in my opinion the greatest American novel as well, surpassed only by the likes of Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo.<br />It is the story of a man struggling to survive on his own terms, without compromise. Howard Roark, an architect, wishes only to design buildings that are beautifully functional. But he is thwarted at every turn by an establishment that views adherence to worn out traditions, and mediocrity by concensus, as the only acceptable course of action. He fights back with hard work and argument, and ultimately triumphs as a romantic hero should.<br />The Fountainhead is also a philosophical justification of rational selfishness. Rand understood better than anyone how our culture has perverted the concept of selfishness until it was stripped of all real meaning. In the Fountainhead she will make you see this concept without the tainted lens that we are all taught to view it with. Agree with her philosophy or no, it is radically different than anything else forced down our throats via modern education.<br />The only flaw in Rand's masterpiece is the character of Dominique. Dominique is too abstract, and her inner struggle is unrealistic. Dominique is more idea than character, and while she works as an idea, some of her actions are simply unbelievable. But read it for yourself, and see if you concur...

0451197968|5.0|read this book.  The movie simply pales in comparison.  The underground post-apocalyptic game area of the movie just made no sense.  This book actually takes part in the U.S. and regular people can call in and tell the Hunters where the Runners are.   It's like America's Most Wanted turned in to a game show.  All the characters are as real as they come and there's no cheesy weapons or story lines.  If you are in to action stories this is it.
6302038308|5.0|This isn't a sequel as you might think at first glance at the title.  Instead it is a superior remake of the original &quot;Evil Dead&quot;.  This won awards for its special effects and they are indeed pretty impressive if gory.  The plot is a bit weak perhaps but frankly I don't think we are to take this as a serious commentary on the occult or anything like that.  Bruce Campbell is amazing to watch and that is good because I'd 70% of the movie is just him battle unseen forces of evil.
B000089RVX|5.0|'omg i'm SO sick of evanescence!' is what seemed like all of my friends said. actually so was i. after endlessly listening to &quot;bring me to life&quot; which was the only song i had listened to by them i got sick of the song, therefore i got sick of evanescence. after that i had mistaken them for a goth group, i must admitt their music isn't for happy go-lucky people. this is the type of cd i pump up after i get into a fight with my parents. but eventhough it's not &quot;oh baby&quot; type of music it isn't close to being as dark as metallica or afi type of music. if you like creed/3 doors down/nickleback type of music. you'll dig this.
B000060MWU|1.0|I wasted 2 hours and 8 minutes of my life, which I'm never going to get back, watching this film. And for what reason? None. I didn't enjoy the film, I couldn't understand it, and that creepy bug eyed guy is going to give me nightmares. Up until now my worst film was `The Last Broadcast', but at least that was somewhat understandable. This is my new worst film. There is NO point to this film. Maybe some smart genius could work it out, and tell me there's some `hidden meaning' behind it all, but I'm sorry, I could have done something a lot better for 128 minutes.<br />I've never heard of David Lynch before, but he may need some therapy, though.<br />This film is very reminiscent of a silent movie - there's not much dialogue, and there's heavy focus on the imagery. I prefer more dialogue. Imagery does not explain certain scenes in this film. At certain parts, you can almost hear the music to the Twilight Zone playing - not literally, it just felt like it should be added over.<br />Patricia Arquette plays a mysterious brunette & an ice cool blonde, and manages to appear naked five times throughout the film, for no apparent reason. And have sex in the full glare of a car's headlights?! Whatever turns you on. And another chick gets naked too. Definitely a movie for the guys, I think. Girls, buy something decent.<br />When the video gets played, you almost expect the phone to ring, and tell you that you have seven days before you die - like `The Ring'. Did no one else see this? Very similar. Same bad quality video picture!<br />This film could have been cut in half, still kept in all that was necessary, and I still would have been bored. At 128 minutes, it was too long.<br />I expected the trailer to be better on the DVD. I've seen better teasers than that. It explained nothing about the film, and it just repeated the credits at the beginning. And how BORING were those beginning credits? The `lost highway' drove me mad, they could have turned a corner or something!<br />Giovanni Ribsi (better known as Frank, Phoebe's brother in `Friends') has a very small role in this, and is virtually unrecognisable with black hair - but you recognise the face pretty quickly if you're a fan of `Friends' or have seen him in `Gone In 60 Seconds'.<br />Gary Busey (Point Break, Lethal Weapon) also appears in this, looking very much like an ageing hippie! I recognised his voice instantly, and had a laugh at his appearance!<br />The transmogrification was very confusing. People have said Patricia Arquette playing two different characters in the same film was confusing. That wasn't so confusing. One was brunette, the other was blonde - not that hard to tell the difference.<br />Don't see this film unless you're a masochist. If you're eyeing it up in the shops, put it DOWN, and choose a GOOD movie.<br />Shawn, next time choose a better film, sweetheart. Definitely one of your worst choices. And you say I have bad taste in films?!iovanni Ribsi (better known as Frank, Phoebe's brother in `Friends') has a very small role in this, and is virtually unrecognisable with black hair - but you recognise the face pretty quickly if you're a fan of `Friends' or have seen him in `Gone In 60 Seconds'.<br />Gary Busey (Point Break, Lethal Weapon) also appears in this, looking very much like an ageing hippie!

B00008H2LB|2.0|Now the review this site provides you...don't listen to it. I'm a long time LP fan and they have it totally backwards. Hybrid Theory (HT) had great lyrics, great videos, and a lot of anger. Now with meteora its too pop. The numb and faint videos [are terrible] and all the lyrics on the album are shallow and far to easy to interprept on only the first listen. It's also a worse copy of HT. Along with being poppish they are now becoming sell outs (having own shoes) if you want the real and better LP get hybrid theory or wait for next CD, hopefully it'll be better. If the next Cd isnt good i have to give up becuase then they are hopless. so as a closing thought remember HT is anything but pop and meteora is all pop. so for you teenies out there. this is for you. but you rock fans who listen to lyrics. i wouldnt recommend this... :p

Based on the award winning novel by Fannie Flagg, this movie is about a troubled woman Evelyn Couch, who makes friends with a lady in a local nursing home, and listens to stories about her family.  Many of which are shown in the film.  Some parts are funny like when Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) rear-ends the Volkswagen six times.  Some parts are sad like when Buddy gets hit by a train.  Some are even scary like when the KKK arrives and takes Ruth's baby.  But I really get a big laugh out of the joke about the lake being carried over to Georgia.

0380807343|5.0|Neil Gaiman's splendid CORALINE (now in trade paperback) addresses age-old themes -- the loss of parents (or the fear of it), the concept of courage, the flaws and strengths which enable heroism to occur, the power of the imagination to preserve sanity under duress -- with a story that never loses momentum, not for a moment.<br />It is very rare for me to complete even a brief novel in one sitting, but CORALINE gave me no option. Gaiman has revived the horror story and has done it with dignity. He's given us a young heroine who, in her struggle to rescue her parents and the lost souls of strangers, embodies fears and strengths most of us have.<br />While there are instances, rare instances, in which the narrative or dialogue might have been pared or refined, these do not detract from a book which will draw young adults, adults and middle-grade readers with equal magnetism.<br />The best \\"children's\\" book I've read this year.
0385491026|5.0|_Cat's Eye_ is a novel that speaks to everyone.  It speaks to those who moved often in childhood, and those who left their hometowns to escape negative memories.  It speaks to artists.  It speaks to women, and to anyone who had difficult relationships in childhood.  It speaks to those who have obtained a measure of success, and to those that haven't.  It speaks to Canadians, Americans, and even to men.  It speaks to anyone who is haunted by their past.<br />Elaine Risley is an artist who is returning to her home city of Toronto for a retrospective of her work.  Following her everywhere as she moves through the streets is the shadow of Cordelia, her childhood friend, confidant, and finally, her torturer.  We learn about Elaine's childhood through highly effective and captivating flashbacks:  her father was an entymologist, they moved around often, and when Elaine was finally able to settle and make friends she chooses the wrong girls.  We suffer with her through her torment, and sympathize with her as an adult trying to heal through her art.<br />For me, the descriptions of Elaine's paintings are some of the finest points of the book.  Each painting is a capsule of Elaine's childhood: the images overlap and symbolize events which she is trying to take out and place onto the canvas in order to purge herself.  The reader can envision them clearly, and understand where they came from in the artist's psyche.  The paintings are essential to the hypnotic flow of the book (one of them is displayed on the cover).<br />Ultimately, with the help of her successful retrospective and revisiting of Toronto, Elaine does finally emerge from her personal blizzard and into the sunlight.  It is a journey well worth taking with her.  One of my three favorite books of all time.

B000001IPL|5.0|Ive heard all the offspring cds except S/T and ixnay on the hombre, and ive gotta say this is the best! great lyrics and insane guitar will define this album.  My personal favorite songs are itll be a long time, Bad Habit and Gotta get away.  if you are even remotely into this type of music, buy this CD.  it could quite possibly be one of the greatest albums ever made
B000089RVX|5.0|the singer is very talented and I really enjoy listening to her voice. I like the complexity of the songs and the tight arrangments. I just hope that all their success won`t cause them to break up.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|After attending the Greendale concert I was anxious to hear the studio version.  This album is all part of a big story about a town named Greendale and a cop killing.  It also gave Neil a chance to update his political views including saving the environment etc.<BR>  The guitar work is amazing and most Neil fans will have no trouble getting lost in the long melodic riffs, however some people might be turned off to the fact that most of the songs on the album are over 5 minutes, some some streach out to 10 minutes long.<BR>  I have really enjoyed this album, and hope that Neil keeps up his originality in the years to come.<br />Rock on!

0375703764|1.0|I am midway through Mark Z. Danielewski's  House of Leaves, and I must admit that the Pynchon reference on the back cover absolutely baffles me.  It seems to me that Mr. Danielewski has simply created a sterile amalgam of Infinite Jest, Pale Fire, Rules of Attraction, and, like, a Dean Koontz novel that you might buy at an airport.  Nowhere (thus far) in the novel do I see anything remotely resembling Pynchon's writing - speaking in terms of stylistics, story, diction, aesthetics etc. - except perhaps the protagonist's name; &quot;Johnny Truant&quot; has a certain Pynchonesque resonance.  The text formatting, besides being annoying, also seems to me a bit sophmoric.  &quot;Oh I get it!  The reader's experience in untangling the upside-down, out-of-sequence footnotes mirrors the plight of Navidson et al as they explore the Labrynthine interior of the House (in blue hypertext)!&quot;  Big deal.  Fourth graders write poems about kitty cats in the shape of kitty cats, but that doesn't make them (the poems) enjoyable to read.  Or new.  Or &quot;Postmodern.&quot;  Do yourself a favor and read the books from which this novel is derived instead.
B00000J7S8|4.0|In case this hasn't already been mentioned here, those fans of WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES who are wondering about the mystery 13th track, &quot;Why Should I Care&quot; (the cd booklet only lists 12 tracks), it's barely mentioned in the booklet credits as a &quot;bonus track&quot;. It doesn't mention who the composers are. To help solve the mystery, Krall's song is played during the end credits of the movie TRUE CRIME which starred and was directed by Clint Eastwood. &quot;Why Should I Care&quot; was co-written by Eastwood along with Carole Bayer Sager and Linda Thompson. Eastwood, a big jazz and Krall fan, asked her to record the song for his movie.
B0000AI44Q|2.0|I didn't think it could get more boring after the \\"Are You Passionate\\" tedium.  Well, it has.  This is coming from a lifelong Neil Young devotee through thick and thin....seeing him in concert for the first of many times in January 1971. Greendale may be ambitious only because it is a first of sorts for Shakey (2 stars given vs. one for the quality of the music and arrangments)....a full scale thematic \\"concept\\" album.  The problem with Neil and Greendale is that many of us are tiring of purchasing (and listening to) much of his recent output (although Silver And Gold was good because it blended the best of Neil - melodic, in good voice, introspecive)only to be mostly disappointed while we continue to allow Neil to follow his muse.  And yes, we allow Neil this luxury, because the diehard fans (of which he has many) continue to spend their hard-earned dollars on anything he releases....me included.  Mr. Shakey knows and realizes this, and I believe, takes full advantage of his position.  <br />My reaction to Greendale after initial listenings is, yes, total boredom once again.  There is absolutely nothing new here.  The tempos are all very similiar, the arrangements bland, uninspired and not the least bit creative in any way.  The music is bland, hardly melodic and each song seems to go on forever with no new ideas, twists or anything to keep the listener interested.  This had to be a bore for the Crazy Horse boys (lucky you, Poncho, Neil did not need you for this one!), although I'm sure they appreciate the backing band wages Neil must offer them.  The music is lifeless, tedious, meandering, and oh so dull.  Neil's sing/speak vocals prove he can't find a memorable melody or even a riff that leaves any impression at all. And, every once in a while we are treated (uugh) to the vocal stylings a la the Old Ways era....no thank you.  Sorry, Neil, but this is the last time I'll shell out on the first day of release for any of your new work again.  I'll wait awhile to seeif I'm interested.  I will always be a fan, but Neil, please follow your muse on your own dime and time.  I've lost interest in your tedium.  <br />By the way, what is Greendale about?  With the uninspired music the story is set to, does anyone really care?  Hold on to your wallet....Neil's ready to snatch another [money amount]!!
0684857820|5.0|It is my own experience, in asking other people who have read this book, that it is much more appreciated by those who share an experience similar to the author's.  Alice tells the story of how she was raped, and how she fought back.  Reading it was an inspiration to me, as i was raped 2 and a half years ago, and I found myself comforted knowing that it is possible to fight back against such a crime.  Unfortunately I cannot ever do what Alice does in her book, but I was overjoyed to know that it is possible.  When I asked a friend of mine what she thought of the book, she told me she found it quite self-centered.  Being able to relate to the book made it a much better read.  My friend didn't totally understand it.  I would recommend this book if you can easily put yourself in the author's position.  If not...  it might not be the book you think it will be.  Happy reading.
B00009ATIX|1.0|&quot;Solaris,&quot; by Stanislaw Lem, holds a prominant place in the science fiction book catalogue.  It is a deeply moving story of one man's loss and his final confrontation with his inner demons.  It is also a treatise on the nature of how subconscious forces shape and mold ego and how memory and love shape our reality.  And, if that's not enough, it is also a story about the nature of God's relationship with man.  Obviously, translating this book onto the screen is a monumental task, not only because of the comlex themes, but also because of the fundamental lack of physical adventure.  All the action is psychological, if you will.  Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 version of this book was overall successful in relaying the comlexities of Lem's ideas, however, it is very slow-paced, long, and, consequently, requires effort on the part of the viewer to stay focused during the movie.  In the recent version of &quot;Solaris,&quot; Steven Soderberg, wants to avoid the length and intellectual challenge offered by Tarkovsky and ends up compromising the entire movie.  He assumes that a shorter screenplay and directorial bravado will lure the audience and peak viewer interest in the story.  Thus, he uses his signature editorial style of jump cuts, handheld shots, exquisite cinematography, and, cache actor, George clooney.  He also pared the story down to focus and explore the love story in more detail, leaving the more introspective philosophical themes hidden (perhaps, buried).  While the other themes of the book are there, you have to really tease them out.  The spiritual issues, for example, are abruptly and rather simplistically introduced in the dinner party scene, only to be abandoned in the remaining exposition.  Moreover, we are shown Mr. Clooney's derriere  gratuitously on two occasions, as if to infuse the movie with a dose of sensationalism lest the audience fall asleep.  While, the cinematography is very effective and the sound effects are invloving, the editing becomes tedious and distracts away from the story.  No doubt, this is a challenging project to bring to the big screen, let alone to popular cinema; however, I found the use of such trite pandering patronizing and somewhat insulting.  This story is only cheapened, its themes diluted, by the addition of unnecessary eye candy.  Indeed, this latest version of &quot;Solaris&quot; is largely a failure because it is rendered uninteresting and irrelevant precisely by the very strategy used to keep people watching.  All these maneuvers only serve to distract from the story, rather than to tell it.<br />As for the DVD, I found the interviews totally self-aggrandizing and shameless in their claims of originality.  This movie clearly borrows imagery from great scifi movies, such as 2001 as well as 1972's Solaris.  Nowhere in the interviews is proper credit given to these earlier movies.  It seems from the interviews, that the producers and director of this movie want us to believe it represents a totally original form of scifi movie.  I didn't buy it in the least.<br />I gave this movie one star for cinematography and sound.mes tedious and distracts away from the story.

B00004WGAI|5.0|I have seen a few versions of Jane Eyre, but this one tops them all.  It's the only one that took the story straight off the pages of the book, taking the time that was necessary to tell the whole story.<br />Although Zelah Clarke did look a bit old, and was a bit too pretty, she did manage to embody Jane's mousiness and small stature.  I do admit that while she played Jane well, she didn't bring anything new to the character.  I didn't look at her performance and think, &quot;Wow, I didn't think Jane would do it like that.&quot;  She was competent, rather than remarkable.<br />Timothy Dalton may have been too handsome, but I don't think there was a better Rochester out there.  He was so passionate he almost breathed fire!  There is nothing that moved me more than Rochester sobbing, &quot;Think of my life when you are gone,&quot; to a departing Jane.  His passion for Jane was evident.  It oozed out of every pore.  I think Charlotte Bronte looks down on his performance and approves wholeheartedly.

B00005JLEX|5.0|I cannot believe the greatest show of all time isn't out on DVD yet.  Seinfeld fans must unite against the man and get this thing out ASAP!<br />What they need to do is release it in a set containing all nine seasons, with commentary on every episode, interviews with every cast member, creators, and all guest stars.  Then, if they have unaired episodes (which would be GREAT!) they should throw them on.  It would also be quite awesome if they secretly filmed a 2-hour special showing their lives after prison and put it on as a surprise.  They should also have an interactive game with almost all episodes.<br />That's my vision for the Seinfeld collection.  Most of those things'll probably never happen, but then again I just want the show!<br />(Like my ideas?  E-mail at [email] to share your thoughts!)

B00001OH7T|3.0|The dense baseline and sparkling saxophone that begin David Bowie's 1975 album, Young Americans officially announced it: Bowie had gone soul. In a career that had not yet lasted a decade, Bowie had already been an Anthony Newley-ish crooner, a heady folk-wizard and a sexually-charged, over-the-top glam rocker and now he had found a new niche: funked-up soul singer.<br />Bowie, despite being a skinny white dude from England, takes on the role surprisingly well. His voice (always an underrated asset next to his songwriting skills and general sense of vision) has the style, adaptability and confidence of a genuine soulman. He is low, slinky and sexy on the title track, an offbeat tribute to the US's conflicting ideals on love and sex and strident and funky on \\"Fame,\\" his indictment of celebrity (co-written by John Lennon). Yet he is at his best on neither of these two tracks (the best know), but \\"Fascination,\\" a sinister-toned account of crazed love, in which Bowie and his army of back-up singers briskly pursue one another for six invigorating minutes.<br />Young Americans is also a very well-produced album. Bowie and long-time producer, Tony Visconti seem to have studied and assimilated soul suitably. The chunky bass lines, dazzling sax and roaring back-up singers (including a young Luther Vandross) always seem exactly in the right place.<br />Surprisingly, the biggest flaw of Young Americans is not any difficulty sounding like an authentic soul record, but its songwriting, a skill Bowie exceeded at on past albums. Four tracks (The three previously mentioned and a cover of The Beatles' \\"Across the Universe\\") are fine. Yet the other four (\\"Right,\\" \\"Win,\\" \\"Can You Hear Me,\\" and \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\") seem lazily written and awkwardly-worded. These come off as mere excuses for Bowie to show-off his soul swagger.<br />Because of the songwriting slump, Young Americans is not one of the great Bowie albums of this era (of which there are many). Yet it is a necessary step in his fascinating career and a fine example of his ability to absorb and process any musical styling and yet always sound like himself.
B00005B3Z6|2.0|Apparently all these rave reviewers can somehow get past the fact that the \\"hot\\" central character (Brian's counterpart in US version) is a very average looking guy.  His pal (Michael's counterpart) is better looking.  Okay, I don't want to be be a strictly superficial homosexual, but the central conceit of every plot line falls flat when there is no way to believe that this guy could really be picking up all those actually hot guys.  With that major flaw in mind, all other credibility for the series goes right out the window... and even becomes laughable.
B000002GYR|4.0|Fans only familiar with the feral boogie man who recorded Rain Dogs and Bone Machine may be surprised to hear Tom Waits' distinctively minor key debut, Closing Time. The early Waits was a melancholy, serene singer/songwriter. Instead of screaming and growling his lyrics over a rumbling mixture of blues, rock and Kurt Weill-ish melodies, Waits gently croons them over a tender piano. Closing Time is definitely Tom Waits at his most conventional and listener-friendly.<br />But the debut is more than the album to listen to when you want to hear Tom Waits but don't want to scare your friends. This style best accents the man's impeccable song-writing talent and what a great selection of songs this is. &quot;Old 55,&quot; a tribute to the morning after the ball, is perhaps the best known due to the vastly inferior Eagles cover. Yet the album has a slew of as-good or better numbers. &quot;I Hope I Don't Fall in Love With You&quot; is perhaps Waits' best anti-love song (and he's written many). &quot;Old Shoes (&amp; Picture Post Cards)&quot; is a song about moving on that somehow sounds both forlorn and hopeful at the same time. And &quot;Midnight Lullaby&quot; is the kind of understated, gorgeous number that makes the career of Tony Bennett or Johnny Hartman-types.<br />On &quot;Martha&quot; Waits calls-up an old lover and reminisces of days gone by. &quot;Those were the days of roses, poetry and proses/And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me,&quot; he sings. It is familiar territory for singer/songwriters but Waits writes and sings about it with such a sincerity and tenderness that that scarcely matters. This song epitomizes what Closing Time is about: great songs sung straight from the heart.

0684833395|4.0|With good reason, Catch-22 is a smart alleck classic. Joseph Heller munches-up one of our most sacred institutions, the military and spits it back into faces. Through the eyes of Yossarian, the World War II bombardier who wants nothing more than to not die, Heller exposes all that is kitschy, absurd and soul-numbing about not just the US army but about the high-minded American attitude in general. Indeed, this is probably less a novel about warfare, as it is a novel that comments on all American extremes including extreme pride, extreme capitalism and extreme bureaucracy. Heller may be a gadfly and he may be too cute at times (my only significant complaint about his style) but it is undeniable that he often has a point. It is easy to commiserate with Yossarian. Why is the numbskull who commands his regiment any less of an enemy than the numbskull who commands the one on the other side when both could get him killed? What do things like pride and country matter to someone who is dead? What does it all mean in the end? Those are questions for the reader to answer, but it is pretty certain that there is a passage somewhere in Catch-22 that would take a pretty good shot at his or her resolution.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The pinnacle of Errol Flynn's string of swashbuckling adventures...The most expensive film Warners had ever made (until 1938),  and in glorious Technicolor, to boot...The film with the most cherished of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's many film scores...The film that literally set the standard for every 'Robin Hood' and 'Knighthood' movie since...One of the greatest films, not only of the 1930s, but of all time...THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is, in EVERY sense of the word, a CLASSIC, and the new DVD edition is LONG overdue!<br /><br />The story of Sherwood Forest's favorite bandit had been a movie staple since silent films (Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatic 1922 version was regarded as one of his finest roles), and the WB,  riding high on a string of hits by Fairbanks' younger and sexier successor, Errol Flynn, knew they had all the elements in place to create a grand entertainment that no other studio could match!<br /><br />Originally intended for James Cagney, the property had languished for three years, until Errol Flynn exploded onto the scene, and the studio knew they had the actor 'born' to play the role. Not wishing to run into legal problems with United Artists, who'd produced the 1922 film, an original script, incorporating elements of \\"Ivanhoe\\", ancient legends, medieval ballads, a popular 19th century stage production, and a bit of Howard Pyle, was written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller (with some uncredited assistance by Rowland Leigh). Casting nearly all of their \\"British Colony\\" in speaking roles, the studio brought back Alan Hale to reprise his 1922 role of  Little John (an excellent choice, as Flynn and Hale had terrific rapport), casted rotund comic actor Eugene Pallette (Guy Kibbee was the first choice) as a gravelly-voiced Friar Tuck, and Flynn's LIGHT BRIGADE costar, Patric Knowles, as Will Scarlett (David Niven was unavailable). As the villains, Claude Rains played the fey Prince John, and Basil Rathbone (whose duel with Flynn in CAPTAIN BLOOD was a film highlight) was perfection as the villainous Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Maid Marion's Norman suitor, and Robin's arch-nemesis. In the role of  Marion, could anyone OTHER than Olivia de Havilland have been cast? Flynn and de Havilland had already done two films together (and would do four more, after ROBIN HOOD), and their chemistry was so perfect that 1930s screen magazines were always hinting of a romance between the two (there wasn't, despite overtures by Flynn; they remained simply friends, with Olivia and Errol constantly playing pranks on each other).<br /><br />Not that the production was problem-free; the original director, William Keighley, was axed after the location shooting was completed, as the studio didn't like his approach to the script and actors; Michael Curtiz, who had 'made' a star of Flynn, in CAPTAIN BLOOD, was quickly brought in, adding his sense of drama, lighting (the<br />'light-and-shadow' climactic duel between Robin and Sir Guy was a Curtiz 'trademark'), and style. Both Curtiz and Keighley would share the 'Director' credit when the film was released.<br /><br />THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was Warners' biggest box office hit of 1938, became a multiple Academy Award winner (with the most statuettes of any film that year), and it's luster has only increased through the years, being named as one of the AFI's 100 Greatest Films of All Time.

I have admired her talent since she has begun but she slapped every non believer of her in the face with this album. Every track on the album is a single that was put together. The album tells a story, track by track and its amazing how her talent shines through in every word sung. I dont even have a true favorite because they are all so well written,produced,sung,mixed and everything!!Not only is this album a must have for anyone who enjoys music but a true treasure that definately shows that she will be around for as long as she wants.We get to view and see her real self and are left satisfied after hearing \\"Stripped\\" and knowing that no matter what like she says herself she will keep singing her song.<br />P.S. Anybody who is able to hear and has ears should pick it up!

0385504209|5.0|I have read all of Mr. Brown's books and am glad his work is finally getting the attention it deserves. The Da Vinci code takes the lead character from what I think is Mr. Brown's best book, Angels and Demons, and plants him at the scene of a murder within the Louvre. The story moves with the speed of a hit hollywood movie, and from what I understand it may well become one. This has been Mr. Brown's style with all his books. Short chapters that almost always end suspensefully, forcing the reader to keep committing to &quot;just a few more pages&quot; before going to bed. I have never taken more than 72 hours to read one of Mr. Brown's books. They are just too hard to put down!<br />The Da Vinci code is extremely well-researched, and it is amazing how Mr. Brown is able to craft a puzzle with so many twists, turns and double-meanings. If you haven't read the Da Vinci code yet and have an interest, I'd suggest reading Angels and Demons first. It isn't at all necessary to understanding the Da Vinci code, but it does give you an introduction to Robert Langdon and is the first book in this series that I am sure will be long-running and successful.

B00008J4P5|2.0|Confession: I never listened to the full album, only because I can't. Don't get me wrong the song writing is good and the singing and guitars are fine but it's the drums. The drummer seriously needs a drumming lesson. She hit the cymbals way too much it sounded like a 3-year old was playing. That ruined the album for me and I just can't listen to it from start to finish.

Don't get me wrong I'm not one of those 'grungy I love Ten &amp; Vs. Only' fans. In fact No Code and Yield are my favorite Pearl Jam albums but this one just didn't cut it for me. I can't explain why or how it just didn't have the same feel. But who knows give it time and it might be my favorite. It did take No Code 3 years to rise to the top of my list.

6304779356|4.0|I've always loved movies from the eighties; especially this one it's dark, fun and funny.  Corey, Jason and the boys make a great team!
0553103547|2.0|The book is very well-written in an engrossing style, but it does not present an epic storyline that really connects it with the rest of the books.  It is still too early to tell,(the series isn't through).  For the most part is simply a bunch of different characters (some die off) going through individual stories with very little interaction with each others storylines.<br />  In Lord of the Rings there was always the story, in Dune there was always the story behind all the writing.  In this there does seem to be anything so far, but hints of a possible story.  And to me that is not really worthwhile to me to even try to read a multi-book series that might possibly have a story behind it.  I found this book very boring because I felt like I was reading a soap-opera (a well-written one) more than a fantasy story.  Some reviewers suggest that the story is about a battle for the Iron throne between competing factions or a murder mystery.  That's nice, but when you don't make it clear who the real main character is (and by that I mean that if you kill off a character midway in the series than they are clearly not the main character)than it makes this struggle for the throne or solving the mystery less worthwhile.<br />  This book itself concerns several characters and there individual storylines.  And though the characters are well-drawn, there is no main storyline (so far) that really binds their storylines together except in very indirect ways.  It is as some reviewers put it, exactly like a soap-opera for the fantasy genre.  A well-built world full of characters with no story.  (Atleast that's been presented yet).  If you like soap-operas you'll love this book, if you read an epic fantasy novel for both a world and a story than this may not be the book for you.  I personally am going to wait until the series is over before I read any more of these books, and if at the end he does reveal a main storyline binding all these otherwise pointless details and storylines than I may change my tune about this book and the series itself.an I may change my tune about this book and the series itself.
B00009RGBS|5.0|Having reviewed the theatrical release version and the soundtrack of this superb film I still feel the need to &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot;.  The DVD just released not only reinforces just how excellent this company production is, it makes CHICAGO more important by reducing the size of the screen to fit your home TV and in doing so the DVD microscopes in on the nuances of the performances by Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, Taye Diggs, Colm Feore, and all of the dancers.  Rob Marshall just illuminates your home with his skillful rendering of Bob Fosse's Kander and Ebb musical.  But the part that makes the disc a cinch to own is the extended added feature of watching all of the actors prepare this show and feeling the enormous amount of respect and love they obviously have for each other.  This is a true company production.  And you SHOULD own this!
0783240287|4.0|I bought this the other day for my daughter's 9th birthday.  I was a bit worried about the sound after reading some of the other comments here.  Well, I am no audiophile, but there is definitely something not quite right about the sound.  But at worst, it sounds to me at times as though the visual and audio are a tiny bit off-sync, so that you lose the impression that you're actually watching them sing.  Not often, but it's noticeable.  And I agree with other comments about a number of the costumes being too suggestive.  <br />Having said that, my daughter loves this DVD, and we also got the original Broadway cast CD, so we are all Joseph, all the time (for now).
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Clearly , Neil has a message here and he is probably the only singer/songwriter who would have the guts to use a full CD and a live tour to deliver it. So, if nothing else you have to give him credit for that. He sings about television invading our lives (and the lives of anyone remotely related to those who commit crimes), police brutality, government corruption, corporate greed and waste, the slow destruction of our Mother Earth..its all in here. But he also believes there is hope in our youth that they can rise up against it all..and not take it anymore. As he said in a recent Greendale interview \\"It hasn't gotten to the point where things have started moving yet, but this period is the biggest breeding ground for revolution in this country since the mid-Sixties. I don't think there's been a more ripe time for a generation to come along and rebel against all this.\\" ... \\"You can't fool youth. There's a lot of kids who do not like what's going on. They don't like the country the way it's being run.\\" Maybe Neil is trying to get the youth moving himself. This album deserves to be talked about a lot in that light alone..i.e.the message he is delivering here!<br />Moving from the message to the medium, I much prefer the acoustic DVD version of this album, recorded live in Dublin. <BR>I think this is the way this album is best enjoyed. Neil tells the story himself and sings each song alone..with just his acoustic guitars and harps and its a warm wonderful session. In the CD version with the Horse I find the drumming almost annoyingly loud ..at times almost drowning out the singing..and Neil himself seems to almost \\"talk the lyrics\\" through many of the tunes. In the solo DVD version he really sings (as only Neil can sing) and sings with conviction and passion that I felt was lacking on the CD. I enjoyed listening to the CD, and probably would have given it 3 Stars but when I watched the DVD I was enthalled..transfixed...smiling. So the 5 Stars is definitely for the DVD release! Make sure you see it before you pass judgement on this one.
B000002BFZ|5.0|this is the pearl jam album that slipped through the cracks. if you aren't a hard core fan, its probably a safe bet to say that you have probably only heard, or even heard of one or two of the tracks contained herein. do not be discouraged.<br />from its pensive beginning notes in 'sometimes' all the way to the last chord of the sleepy lullabye called 'around the bend', pearl jam leads us througha gambit of emotions, textures and styles. 'who you are' has a very eastern feel, which is then countered by the rhythmic 'in my tree'. 'smile' can be described as a kind of lighthearted ballad, maybe even a love song -- either way, its absolutely gorgeous. <br />'no code' can accurately be described as being pretty low key throughout its entirety. the song writing is clearly more mature than earlier efforts like 'vitalogy'. this album also happens to contain one of the more unappriciated rock songs ever in 'present tense'. its a gorgeous tune that deals with the themes of eastern philosophy, the afterlife, and taking advantage of every minute of your life. i will go out on a limb, and call it a 'stairway to heaven' for we twentysomethings.<br />lots of these reviews say that this should not be your first pearl jam record, and i could not disagree less. listen to this record, and then work your way backward, to fully appriciate the music the boys managed to write for this 1996 epic. <br />'no code' is a lost classic of american rock from the 90s. in an era of big sound and big production, this simply did not fit the mold -- maybe the mold should fit it.
0385504209|2.0|This book is a roaring good read, which is reason enough to spend a couple of evenings with it.  But the author's facts are skewed and some of his assertations are just plain silly.  (If that's who he says it is in the center of the painting with Jesus, then why was James, brother of Jesus omitted from the gathering of apostles?)  You've heard of junk science?  This is junk history.  Enjoyable, but not very nourishing for the mind.
0385504209|3.0|It's neither as good nor as bad as many of the reviews claim. I had great fun reading it on vacation. As a theology student, not everything mentioned by Brown is completely impossible, especially if one considers that what we have as the Bible and Christian tradition comes out of the social biases of the last 3,000 years and that they are incredibly patriarchal. One bite I have is that his characters conclude that if Jesus were married then he could not have been divine (away with the incarnation, resurrection, etc.). Maybe it's not that black and white. Maybe it is possible for the Son of God to have [made love]within a loving married relationship SINCE THAT'S NOT A SIN.<br />Have fun reading it and then DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.
0553278223|1.0|dont read this book if you are looking for a book that is interesting.  the martian chronicles was easily the worst non-fiction book i ever read. it is boring and hard to understand.  there is no flow and because of when it was written the author is completly wrong about how space exploration has turned out.  <BR>DONT READ THIS BOOK
B00005KFUM|5.0|This is an amazing record start to finish. I can't wait for their next album (September 2003?). Anyway, those other reviews are largely on the mark, so I'll try to add something a little different. <br />MUSE is an interesting mix; they remind me of angrier, rockin' version of Radiohead pre-Kid A. Something like Radiohead meets Rage Against the Machine. There's a youthful anger in MUSE that Radiohead used to have, but have now lost due (I assume) to old age. MUSE's Matt Bellamy makes Thom Yorke's voice look meek in comparison. <br />MUSE manages to bring together a variety of techniques that make for truly ground-braking music. The music has a very heavy feel, but remains incredibly melodic and trippy at the same time. <br />The band uses contrast very well, between slow and soft, heavy and fast, while at the same time always managing to create a high energy wall of sound. <br />Somewhat related, the music also has a classical sensibility... songs have a tendency to build towards climaxes and go in directions you would not anticipate at first listen. No 3 minute pop songs here. <br />I push MUSE on everyone I know, though it's definitely not for everyone (sorry bastards). It's probably too heavy for some, and I've met some people who can't stand his voice, but, as I say, Matt Bellamy makes Thom Yorke look like a little boy. Give it a listen before buying.<br />When I hear Matt Bellamy belt out at the top of his lungs, it occurs to me that MUSE is the official music of the apocalypse, the four horsemen and all that good stuff. The Vikings would've dug it, no doubt. <br />Great driving (or walking) music, gets you really pumped up and ready to tear the world's head off. Not so great for hanging out, a little too intense.<br />Enjoy, and TURN THE VOLUME UP TO 11.
B00005JLSE|4.0|The long awaited DVD release of Chicago comes as a bit of a dissapointment.  The movie, which is amazing from a musical, entertainment, and technical viewpoint, is mistreated by a lackluster collection of Special Features and a below-average video and audio transfer.<br />The DVD includes a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurette, which clocks in at about 28 minutes.  The special concludes with a music video for \\"All That Jazz\\".  Strangely and fortunately, these two features are different than the special and video that came with the soundtrack DVD.  Miramax has also been so kind as to bless us with a multitude of trailers for somewhat random items.  And let us not forget the musical number, \\"Class\\", which is more of a dissapointment than I expected.  The audio commentary on the film is quite interesting, though, there is something missing.<br />In fact, there is a lot missing on the Chicago DVD.  This very easily could have been a two-disc set, though Miramax decided to take the easy-way out and provide \\"enough\\" extras.  There was a music video for Anastacia's \\"Love is a Crime\\" track, which is on the Chicago soundtrack, and is missing from the DVD.  Clips from the Broadway play (or at least a more extensive section on how the story was conceptualized into a play).  It would have been nice to have seen a homage or documentary on Bob Fosse.  And what about the multitude of Chicago trailers that were on television and in theaters, ESPECIALLY around Oscar time.  These clips are lost in the Miramax studios, unless they decide to release a \\"Collector's Edition\\" of some sorts.<br />Though I am extremely satisfied with the film itself, I cannot give this DVD five stars.  If you are also unhappy with the DVD, I would urge you to sign the petition located at [website]
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie was absolutely amazing!  The soundtrack, the characters, the situations were all extremely fabulous.  I don't know what it is about the last scene, but it was depressing as hell.  Perhaps it was the song that added to the effect.  One of my top 10 all time favs.
B00009P1O5|4.0|I always liked the hard rockin' Neil more than the folkie or the other weirder stuff he's tried over the years.  This one in particular struck me when I first heard it on an old cassette (this is the first time it's on cd).  &quot;Shot's&quot; is the obvious classic, with the sound effects &amp; the great pyrotechnic riff over &amp; over.  Maybe that's why I like this album so much.  A song like &quot;T-Bone&quot; gets criticism for being nine minutes long with the same two lines of lyrics over &amp; over again, but it's got a killer riff.  That's why I like funk &amp; electronic music so much is they find a groove &amp; run with it for awhile.  System of a Down is good for keeping you off balance &amp; getting your energy going, but Re*Ac*Tor is good for chugging along down the highway (especially &quot;Southern Pacific&quot;).  I only gave it four stars mostly cause when you compare it to &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; the lyrics don't hold up as well (although I do like the goofy &quot;Surfer Joe &amp; Moe the Sleaze&quot;), but it rocks even harder.
0060283122|1.0|what young girl would want to be forced into marrying a scary older man just for her riches?  the fear in this girl is tremendous.  if there is any history of abuse in a child's life this book would be very disturbing and stressful. this book is warped, has no sense of humor, and is condescending to children (in it's definition and explanation of words).  i bought this and immediately trashed it in hopes that it didn't go into the hands of another child.  i would like to know what inspired him to write something of such low quality?
B000002OX7|4.0|Who can deny the greatness of tracks like Baba O'Riley, Bargain, and Won't Get Fooled Again? These tracks alone are worth the price of the album. However, the majority of the rest is unmemorable. It is an essential British Invasion piece nonetheless.
0517221160|5.0|I have just re-read \\"Little Women\\" and found it even more intriguing then the first time I read it as a preteen.

I hope that the person who left the bad review does not give up on the \\"classics\\", and that they will find one that sticks with them forever.  There really are some that follow a more predictable path and have that happy ending s/he is looking for.

Some 40ish actor to play the role, and what a climactic ending! Great going author! clap hands!
0812548094|3.0|Goodkind writes entertaining stories, but I find his dialogue to be downright poor. The exchanges between Richard and Kahlan seem to me like little kids talking - simple sentences, explaining everything in brutal detail. This series isn't awful, but I admit I'm having trouble finding a reason to keep reading.
B0000025FG|5.0|After reading through the other reviews I am quite frustrated that people are either ashamed of admitting their liking for this album or flatly dismiss it as light discopop.<BR>In my opinion, DISCOVERY is a brilliant pop/rock album on which JEFF LYNNE incorporates some disco elements into his sound. But he definitely does not turn ELO into a disco outfit with this. Anyway, he already showed this approach, to a lesser degree, on OUT OF THE BLUE which the same people who pretend to hate DISCOVERY praise to the skies. Strange, isn't it? Now, here comes my theory for this: DISCOVERY was released at a time when people grew tired of omnipresent disco. Back then, I suppose, it was like \\"well, there is this four-to-the-bar thing, so it must be embarrasing discopop by nature\\". DISCO became a synonym for rubbish. And so, even ELO fans might have become manipulated by the spirit of their time. They finally believed the critics who bashed this album, missing out thus on wonderful synth-ladden pop/rock songs which are in my view as great as for example the ones off OOTB and TIME. <BR>I became an ELO fan in 1990, so I did not fall victim to the spirit of the time of the \\"disco sucks\\" era when every album with a hint of disco style was derided as a matter of course.<BR>So there, I'll shout it out loud: this album is great and atmospheric, featuring some wonderful sounds. It is so fantastic BECAUSE OF some stylish disco elements and not despite them.
B00005JLSE|5.0|My opinion is one of a viewer who did not get to see this in the theater, has never seen Moulin Rouge, and doesn't feel the need to compare the two movies to each other or to compare this movie to the stage versions.  Their success is irrelevant to my enjoyment of this film.  This is entertainment, not a competition, and there's room for everyone after all.  <br />I appreciated how they found a clever way to make the musical format work for 21st century viewers who weren't as likely to accept the idea of characters suddenly bursting into song for no reason.  I have no problem with the fact that they hired an actress to play Roxie who wasn't known for her singing talent.  The character of Roxie is supposed to be a second-rate singer (no offense to Ms. Zellweger).  That was why she couldn't make it big on her own.  Zellweger does an excellent job all things considered.  At times her voice reminded me of Bernadette Peters, particularly in &quot;Funny Honey&quot;.  I especially enjoyed the way she gave that extra-hokey performance of &quot;Nowadays&quot; during the audition scene to emphasize Roxie's lack of talent when in the real world.<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones was of course amazing.  She's really a great dancer.  I had fun watching her rehearse in the behind-the-scenes special feature.<br />Considering the fact that I'm pretty much allergic to Richard Gere, it's saying a lot that I really liked this movie.  I can see why it won the Oscar.  It wasn't just light-hearted campy fluff.  It made a statement about our society, it provided touching drama with characters like poor Amos and Hunyak, and it entertained all at the same time.  It had all the depth of a typical Oscar winner but with some razzle-dazzle to keep it moving.  I still can't get the songs out of my head.
B00007E8V4|4.0|This album is great... for what it is.  It is a collection of stuff that did not make previous albums.  Many of the songs on here are quite great, and there are none that are just horrible.  In fact, all of them would make any other band proud to have written and recorded them.  Comparing this to Toxicity or System of a Down shows why this album gets only 4 stars.. Because everything else these guys have done is even better than this!
0800141849|5.0|Barbra Streisand did a great job on this movie. As it's been mentioned in many other reviews &quot;This isn't your typical ugly duckling story&quot; Barbra always manages to add a little twist to her projects that make them more unique and intersting, and this fine movie is no exception! Highly recomended!

I cried.... over and over again. <br />First I cried because of the faboulous descriptions of the remarcable desert, the tough life as a nomad and naturally the terrible circumsision.<br />Then I was amazed over the willpower and guts of that little girl, leaving her parents, everything she knew, for the unknown, for a dream she didn´t even really know she had.<br />This is the story of a fighter, the toughest woman I have ever heard of!<br />Waris, You, and Your work inspire me. <BR>Thank You for what you are doing.
0385508417|3.0|I thought that the concept of this story was rather interesting.  How many times I haven't wanted to just focus on the true meaning of Christmas and not get caught by the commercial trappings this holiday brings every year.  But it was the characters of this book that left me disappointed.<br />First the neighbors: if my neighbors harassed me the way the Krank's neighbors did, I would be searching for greener pastures in no time.  How you choose to celebrate the holiday is your own business, no one else's.<br />Then the wife, Nora - Good Lord, why didn't she just tell her daughter the truth?!  There is nothing wrong with what she and her husband were planning, in fact it's not that uncommon for couples whose children are grown to get out of town for Christmas.  My husband and I contemplated it many times before our children were born.<br />And then the daughter - to just assume that her parents would have the home fires burning the way they've always been...and show up practically unannounced and assume that her parents couldn't possibly have other plans...what a selfish brat!<br />The reason I am giving this book three stars instead of one or two was because of the way the neighbors did come through in the end, and it was a light, funny read.  I agree with some of the other readers that it would make a great comedy movie...although I picture Craig T. Nelson as Luther.  Just a thought.
B00005JLSE|5.0|For immortalizing a theatrical gem on film and making it even better than the stage musical, we owe Rob Marshall and every person responsible for the making of this movie deep gratitude.  As true today as the day the story was written, this socio-political commentary is deserving of every accolade it has received, and a stellar place in the history of film. It is simply deserving of being the 75th Oscar Best Picture! The performances cannot be more brilliant.  Before its completion, I raised an eyebrow upon learning that Renee Zellweger was playing Roxie Hart.  Having seen remarkable performances on the Broadway stage, I doubted that Renee can do justice to the role.  Boy was I wrong!  Renee turned in a tour de force performance! She is Roxie Hart. Marvelous! Kudos to Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, Queen Latifah and every person in the cast! Bob Fosse is rejoicing in heaven.  Chicago is BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT!!!

0452282152|4.0|Based on the famous Vermeer painting of (obviously) a girl with a pearl earring. Griet goes to work for the Vermeer family when she is sixteen years old to help support her own family. Vermeer's jealous wife Catherine, their mischievious young daughter Cornelia, and the lustful patron van Ruijven all serve to create problems for Griet in her new life. She soon finds herself entangled in, and the very cause of, growing tension and disorder in the household when she begins developing a close bond with Johannes Vermeer himself. Griet treads a fine line remembering her place as a maid serving the family.<br />I enjoyed reading this book though only gave it four stars because the characterization seemed a bit flat at times. Griet's emotions seemed a tad on the generic side and the various antagonists did not have many layers. It was very &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; in the way of characters' personalities. <br />I was also a bit disappointed with the conclusion. Anticlimatic really after the climax scene. The falling action skipped right into the conclusion. <br />Highly recommended nonetheless. I enjoyed this book very much despite the few shortcomings. It's a story you become wrapped up in right away and can't pry yourself away from until the end. Definitely a good choice for anyone looking for a good, quick read.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I like this album alot the video is a nice bonus as well for the price . Neil Young is a master everyone knows it but I've been very suprised with the quality of his last few albums. This one is no different the last few songs with the megaphone are shocking to some strange degree yet wonderful at the same time, I see a cult hit in the making. Marvelious from the master.
B00009UW0N|4.0|This is the sharpest and cleanest the film has EVER looked on video, and the audio commentary is a must-listen!  ... this is in fact the EXACT SAME commentary track found on the old laserdisc, licenced from the Criterion Collection.  The video on this disc is worlds better than the previous efforts, mostly due to the new hi-def transfer and the space the film can now take up.  On the old THX DVD, the widescreen and pan & scan versions of the film had to share space together along with a 30 minute documentary all on one disc.  Now, the widescreen version by itself takes up the whole disc, with all the extras moved to disc 2.  The sound options (not including commentary) are identical to what was on the previous THX disc.<br />The documentary on disc two does tend to go into clip hell, but still contains all the good stuff found in the AMC Backstory special aired last year.  This release stops short of getting 5 stars for two reasons.  The complete scenes from the Television Version were not included, and there are some minor color timing issues which change Cundey's lighting scheme in certain nightime scenes.  Other than that, this set is great, and at a great price.
0887306667|2.0|If calling any business rule-of-thumb a \\"law\\" is a recipe for disaster, claiming it is \\"immutable\\" is the proverbial fuse.  In \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\", authors Al Ries and Jack Trout liken successful marketing to a set of \\"How To's\\" or \\"Tips & Tricks\\".  Adding to the somewhat sketchy structure, the authors (wrongly) predict the demise of many organizations - now successful - that have disregarded their advice.  And too often, laws are created as exceptions to those already established, exculpating the authors from any contrary opinion.  This is a law, except when... or, unless you... is unacceptable.<br />Consider the claim that there exists \\"ominous signs of softness in Microsoft's strategy\\" for pursuing market share in major software applications categories external to the operating system.  At the time of their writing, Ries and Trout point to Microsoft's failure to wrestle the spreadsheet and word processing markets from leaders Lotus and WordPerfect (an example of the Law of Line Extension).  Or, consider that \\"USA Today is the first national newspaper, but it is unlikely to succeed\\".  Time has indeed been cruel to the prophecies of Ries and Trout.<br />Criticism aside, many good ideas are presented throughout the text, however, at an average of only 6 pages per chapter, few get the recognition they deserve.  The Law of Focus (read: positioning) is good advice whereby a firm should own a particular word or phrase in the mind of a customer.  But, it would follow that extending a product line to include different items not captured under the firm's \\"buzz word\\" could be detrimental to either the new product or the whole firm.  Yet, we see Microsoft as a modern-day example to the contrary (and, of course, Microsoft has no catchy buzz word anyway).  Perhaps the authors would consider Microsoft a candidate for the Law of the Category - an example of a firm competing in a market they have solely created.  At this point, however, applying immutable laws tothe problem seems as difficult as correctly guessing the perfect conclusion to a \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" novel.<br />For a laugh, the keen reader will notice the four pages of praise that preface the actual content.  On five occasions, different individuals make the exact same generic statement, \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing is the best book on marketing I've ever read\\".  If there was a Law of Repetition, this book would nail it down (but, there isn't).  Whether an amazing coincidence or publisher error, this sets the tone for the rest of the book.  If you can't nail the details or correctly predict the application of your laws in practice, don't expect your readers to buy into the theory.<br />Although two of the greatest modern marketing minds, Ries and Trout have written a tale destined only for the lowest-common denominator.  Many of their other works, most notably, \\"Positioning\\", are far more comprehensive in their attention to detail and ability to effectively persuade.  Too many unfulfilled (or simply wrong) prophecies make this book an \\"immutable\\" candidate for the half-off shelf at your local bookstore. <br />Joshua A. Gerlick
B00005JKN9|2.0|The promos for the theatrical release made Daniel Day Lewis and the film seem very &quot;cartoonish.&quot;  Daniel Day Lewis comes across as the villian in a Dudley Do Right cartoon in the commercials.  I was surprised to see that Daniel Day Lewis and the film did not come across this way upon viewing the entire thing.  However, I think that &quot;cartoon&quot; feel may have hurt box office receipts.<br />Anyway, back to the actual film.  I agree that Daniel Day Lewis did a great job.  I disagree that he had a great New York accent.  At times I wondered what kind of accent he had.  It seemed &quot;New York&quot; at times, but at other times it came across as Irish.  The scenery, Cameron Diaz, and even Leonardo DiCaprio were all very good.  People, get over the whole Leonardo DiCaprio thing.  His youthful appearance is no reason to criticize him the way everyone does.  Just watch him in &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape,&quot; and you will get a sense of how truly gifted an actor he really is.<br />I felt the film had a very weak and often confusing story.  What exactly happened at the end?  I watched this film with a German friend, and he was absolutely clueless.  I tried to explain the Civil War and people being against the draft.  However, I honestly was very confused myself.  Scorcese failed to get the viewer &quot;emotionally involved&quot; in the story.  The ending battle was extremely anticlimatic.<br />I believe the best part of the film was in the middle when the &quot;Butcher&quot; discovers Amsterdam's true identity and throws knives at the Diaz character.  When he gets Amsterdam on the table and the audience is shouting, it truly comes across as very brutal and grotesque.  However, even this scene winds up missing the mark.<br />The film can be visually stunning at times, but the story (if it really had one)left much to be desired.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Animal House it a very funny movie but this edition is terrible.  First you must sit through about 6 minutes of previews that you can't skip.  Second, the audio of the movie is bad.  Somehow the mix makes it sound hollow and dull, it just does not match the quality of the video.
B000093BDX|5.0|Sounds Of Summer is the latest in a trend of greatest hits albums sparked by Elvis and was copied by Elton John, The Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac.<br />Sounds Of Summer does not fail to deliver. Sounds Of Summer takes you back to the fantasy world of girls, cars and of course, surfing. It is also fitting that it starts and ends with their two most perennially popular songs ( California Girls and Good Vibrations ). Sandwiched between these two classics are 28 classics that defined an era. The music is a mix of carefree, guitar - driven rockers like Fun Fun Fun, Surfin' USA, Little Deuce Coupe and I Get Around and yearning ballads like Getcha Back, Good Timin', Help Me Rhonda ( though it could just as easily fall into the first category, this one expresses the down and out mood of any other ballad ), Don't Worry Baby ( my absolute favorite Beach Boys tune ) and perhaps the most beautiful love song they ever wrote, Surfer Girl.<br />Even lesser known tracks like Do It Again, I Can Hear Music, Darlin', and even the dreadful Wild Honey are to conjure up the memories of a happier time.<br />Sounds Of Summer is perfect for any Summer event, whether it's a barbequeue, a wedding or even a funeral ( okay, maybe not that far ). The point is, buy it, dammit.
B00006F7S4|2.0|I bought this on the premise that everything Beck does will be interesting, if not genius. The problem is, I've listened to the whole album a bunch of times now, and it's still not interesting. The pacing of songs is slow, and while the melodic sounds are pleasant and soothing, it can get pretty boring. In the middle of songs, Beck kind of made me wish he'd do a crazy Hives-like yell and pump out some rock. <br />I'm not saying don't buy it, and I'm not saying it's not good, I'm just saying I expected more from this great artist. &quot;Guess I'm Doing Fine&quot; has some very wise lyrics--maybe if the tempos were more varied between it and every other song on the album, this would be a great album.
0812550706|5.0|There are few works in Sci-Fi that I maintain in my permanent book collection. This is one of them. Some of the others in no particular order of significants are as follows. The Time Machine and War of the Worlds/ H.G. Wells, Blood Music/ G. Bear, The Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog/ C. Willis, Earth Abides /G. Stewart, Seventh Son  and Red Prophet/ O.S. Card, Brave New World/ A. Huxley and finally 1984/ G. Orwell (yeah, I know, the last two aren't really science fiction anymore.)<br />These books are classic for their own individual reasons. Cutting edge, thought provoking, or just downright entertaining. I would not be ashamed to pass any of these on to others or my kids as being highly recommended. There is no real need to expound on the content of the book because many have already done so and the total number of reviews at the top of this page speak volumes already. It is a Sci-Fi must read. Go get it!
B00005JL95|4.0|this film is great a new fave for me but I am a adult and for young kids dont view till older or not at all. some reviews are like its violent yes it has that plus its sci fi and rated pg not g. the story basicly lilo is a girl living with her sister looking for someone to be her friend yeah a best friend she meets stitch at the pound and adopts him . meanwhile the intergaltic space patorl are looking for him . up to this point stitch is a alien being and not doing well on earth water is his enmy and manners were never introduced to him . lilo and stitch is a good film for older children and as for it being disney even they have had violent scenes I think . thanks for reading
0679411585|5.0|As one who has a fixation with the Vietnam war, I have read numerous non-fiction novels pertaining to this conflict. That being said, if I had to comprise a \\"Top five list\\", this book would not only compete with Christian G. Appy's \\"Patriots\\", it just may come out on top. Yes, the writing does not flow perfectly. Nor does combat. Remember that when you read this american classic.
0688163173|5.0|Terrific, pages turn themselves. Story of US marshall and partner traveling to Shutter Island to investigate patient gone missing. This DEFINITELY DOES NOT turn out to be your average investigation.....
B000000993|5.0|This easily blows Alice in Chains and Soundgarden out of the water. Beacause of its great riffs, lyrics, and songwriting in general, I gave it 5 stars. You don't have to skip a single track (except for the 59 blank ones) because every song on here is really good.<br />Just a precaution, though. This is one of the angriest (not heaviest) albums I've ever heard. Each song features Maynard conquering his personal demons instead of singing about weird occult-ish stuff. If you can't handle the occasional well-deserved cuss word and consider yourself to be generally at peace with the world, then please stay far away from this album. If not... especially if you have a major anger-management problem, prepare to be amazed.<br />I think this just might be the best Tool CD out there...
6304708521|5.0|The music \\"video\\" promos are just great.  Consisting at first of typical Beatles promo, then adding in occasional outtakes throughout the clips.  Throughout the entire movie in fact.  Most of the movie IS \\"outtakes\\".  Random fits of laughing and goofyness.  Or maybe that's all they wanted.  Who knows, either way.. this movie is a sure win for any true Beatles fan.
B00008AY3L|5.0|This is a phenomenal collection of Ben Harper tunes!<br />It contains a gorgeous range of genres, from funky tunes to ballads and I absolutely adore all of the songs.<br />I especially admire how Harper is not afriad to portray his Christian beliefs.
0792836634|4.0|I collect dolls and maybe this is way I find a movie about a murdered who gets into a dolls body so he can continue his killing spree scary.  The movie does a good job of letting us be surprised by the first attacks though after that I kept thinking, &quot;just climb up two feet and he can't get you&quot;.  Not a movie for any child to watch at any time!
B00005O5JV|5.0|I put off watching this video because I didn't want to see something that was supposed to be SO cute, SO funny, SO wonderful. Well, I have to say I was really surprised: Reese Witherspoon has made an enchanting comedy that is well-written and acted and is genuinely funny!<br /><br />Witherspoon stars as Elle, the not-so-dumb-blonde sorority queeen who gets dumped by her snooty boyfriend because she's kinda tacky. She decides to show him, and (because she is really smart and the admissions folks were all men), she enters Harvard Law School! Of course, the other students laugh at her and a professor embarrasses her for being unprepared. She learns her lesson, buckles down, goes on to win the Big Case and even gives the graduation speech.<br /><br />All of this fantasy is made possible by the delightful Miss Witherspoon, who is an accomplished comic actress and lets us know it's ok to laugh at her and with her. \\"Legally Blonde\\" is a great chick-flick comedy with solid laughs.
B00005Q4GV|5.0|Patton is a film that was made in 1970.  It's a film that tells the story of one of America's most remembered and most telling characters in history.  George C. Scott gives the performance of the century playing George S. Patton, looking and sounding and acting just like the real Patton, as recorded by Gen. Omar Bradley in which the film is based on.<br />Patton is a very different war movie.  It was quite revolutionary in its time.  Unlike a lot of war movies that survive off special effects, gore and heroism, Patton shines with its drama and realism as you follow the war-time biography of Patton.  You learn a great deal about the politics, the system of the upper brass in our armed forces, and the frustration to coordinate and perform critical opperations.  You also learn a great deal about the man, Patton, himself.<br />There is so much character developing, so much hard work put into the character of Patton, it clearly pays off in a huge way.  This film will intrigue you as well as enlighten you.  Patton's character is entertaining, he's real, he's distant yet close when it comes to relating, and he can be serious as well as funny.  All of this makes Patton a master piece.<br />There is one little problem I had with the film.  And that is I wasn't really pleased with Patton's heroic march through the winter of '44 to save the sieged soldiers.  It wasn't very clear and it had little to no action in it, just telling you that they won it.  This wasn't satisfactory, and yet it was Patton's highlight of his military career.  A major let down, but it wasn't major enough to ruin the film.  Thankfully.  If it wasn't for the structure of the film, which already lacked action and engagements of battles, this might've ruined it if you are somebody who is interested in detailed history of the occurrences in WWII like me.<br />Overall Patton is a very powerful, dramatic film that circles around a man and his obsession with being a combat general in the heat of a war.  It's afilm that you will probably see more than once because it is a very special film.<BR>You cannot get enough Patton, his character will live on because it comes across so powerfully in this film.  It is a character and a story you are unlikely to forget.<br />Grade: A
B00004STPT|5.0|I've never listened to any musical scores or much classical at all before this CD. But now I'm hooked, and I'm looking for other music like this. This soundtrack follows the movie perfectly. It tells a story itself. The rousing battle tracks are heavier than any electric guitar equipped metal band could sound. After listening to track 3 (aptly named &quot;Battle&quot;) I was overcome with an urge to don an iron breastplate and conquer Europe! But the CD is in no way confined to war music, there are ethereal, ancient soundin tracks that take you back to the centuries old plains of ancient Rome. Another gem is the last track, which ends this masterpiece with jubilant North African  singing. This soundtrack is an amazing, epic work of art.
B00009ATKS|5.0|Truth be told, I was getting a bit tired of radio hits and songs with singing.  Not that I hate them, it's just a lot of them sounded alike: Verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, end. After getting into Sigur Ros, I started to get more into this so-called \\"post rock\\" explosion and found my way to Mogwai. Well, this is what you call \\"headphone music\\", something where you can just put it on and let it envelop you as you close your eyes.<br />Hunted by a Freak: You know those moments in songs where you just wanna listen to that song again SOLELY to listen to that one part? This has it. It starts out nice and quiet with arpeggioed electric guitar then it kicks into a haunting vocal chorus. That part you ask? 2:49-3:27. Especially when they repeat that chorus for the 2nd time. Amazing stuff. 12/10<br />Moses I Ain't: Soft plaintive keyboard intro then is joined by a cello(?), and continues for 3 minutes. It's not really much of a song, really. 7.5/10<br />Kids Will be Skeletons: Neat little harmonic intro with subtle strings then a 2nd guitar comes in. Another relaxing song with a slow building crescendo 9/10<br />Killing all the Flies - Another relaxing intro with 2 guitars going on at once doing different lines, then this strange vocal comes in the background which changes another haunting vocals.(Get used to these, there's plenty of them here) which builds to a huge finale then quiets down. How's that for dynamics? 8.5/10<br />Boring Machines Disturb Sleep - Strange sci-fi like sounds open this song with low mixed vocals(whoa!). Kind of like Robot Chant or O I Sleep extended a couple minutes 8/10<br />Ratts of the Capital - Longest song on album. Very faint guitar riff then the drums and bass join in for a slow build up until a rather gorgeous little section. Lots of tempo changes. Can be seen as this album's centerpiece. 9/10<br />Golden Porsche - Very short(2:51) might as a nice melancholy feel to it. Again, another relaxing song, despite it being short. 8/10<br />I Know You Are but What Am I: A repeating piano key with a couple chords thrown in until a drum machine comes in almost 2 minutes later. Rather slow but definately not a throw away. 7.5/10<br />Stop Coming to My House: Quiet haunting beginning until halfway when it introducecs strange noises while maintaining a solemn background. This is like the equivalent of the aftermath of a car crash. Ends with this cartoon(yes I said cartoon) ending with kids and crazy music. 8/10<br />This was the first Mogwai I listened to so I can't compare it to the others but for a first timer, absolutely pleasant work
B00000490M|5.0|This is an awesome film.  The first time I saw it I loved it.  I also loved the sequels that followed.  My favorite Karate film is 3.  I love 3.  The plot: Daniel may be new in town, but he's already made an enemy of Johnny, the toughest kid in school and a karate black belt.  There's only one sloution Daniel has to learn karate too.  But can Mr. Miyagi, the old Japanese handyman, teach him enough to face Johnny in the All Valley Karate Championship? And more important can Daniel win back the girl he loves, and regain his own self-respect?  So much more than a movie about trying to fit in, so much more than a martial arts movie, and so much more than a triumph of an under dog movie, this is a tale about  faith, courage, acceptance, and never giving up.  The acting of Ralph Macchio Noriyuki &quot;Pat&quot; Morita and Elisabeth Shue is excellent.  This film has an excellent plot.  Now I know why this film was such a blockbuster back in 1984.  This is an awesome series.  The first three are excellent.  &quot;The next Karate Kid&quot; is a joke.  I hate it.  I think they should have stopped at three.
B00005JKWI|4.0|If you go into this movie with the idea that there will be consistancies between this and the first OR the idea that this is a vampire world that looks like \\"Buffy\\" then you'll be disappointed. Instead watch it to see Wesley Snipes kick ... and be kicked, watch it for the freaky new vampires, and watch it for the fun of kung fu sword fighting.  I saw it with three other women friends and we thought the eye-candy was sweet!
B000002MU3|5.0|Due to the unavoidable fact that rock music is as much of a commercial entity as it is an artistic one, flash in the pan acts and genre parasites are constantly being pushed aside in favor of the latest craze.  Occasionally a truly resilient rock band or artist, i.e. the Rolling Stones or Neil Young, can overcome these shifts in the public's preferences and adapt accordingly, but more often than not, immensely talented acts like Santana or the Beach Boys are caught in the fray and quickly reduced to nothing more than petty, nostalgia acts.  However, though it is a rare occurrence for a band to survive pop culture's many mood swings without simply limiting themselves to cult status, it is still far from impossible.<br />In the early 90s, alt. rock finally gave way to its twisted underground cousin grunge and REM was the sole alternative group to creatively reap the benefits.  An obvious touchstone for the latest strain of Seattle rockers, REM quickly realized the profound influence groups like The Melvins, Mudhoney, Sonic Youth, and Nirvana were exerting on modern alt. rock and wasted no time in adapting accordingly.  What resulted was \\"Monster\\", the band's ultimate attempt to completely demolish their godfather status and begin anew.  <br />To properly achieve this, the sessions for \\"Monster\\" began with a thorough cleansing of any and all of the group's residual style before embarking upon a major overhaul of their trademark sound.  Working straight from the ground up, REM cranked the guitars, put some extra mikes around the drums, and cut a blistering set of galloping, feedback laden rockers, all spearheaded by Michael Stipe's fiercely emotive voice.  Peter Buck's guitar buried the band in impenetrable fuzz, allowing only his collaborators primal energy to shine through while the funky rhythm section pushed continually onward.  The entire studio reverberated with the band's not so good vibrations and when the sessions were over, every ounce of the band's energy hadbeen transferred to tape.  <br />Overall, \\"Monster's\\" message was relentless and bold, but REM also had the tact not to overdo it.  Unlike so many of the 90s superstar hopefuls, REM only adopted the grunge sound as a basis for building their own unique vision instead of hijacking it as a one way ride to MTV.  While certain elements of \\"Monster\\" are without a doubt borrowed; the trashy Cobain style solos and the Sonic Youthesque skronk come to mind; the band constantly strives to accommodate their own gentler leanings within \\"Monster's\\" forbidding, harsh atmosphere.  Crooning lullabies like \\"Strange Frequencies\\" and \\"Tongue\\" are cleverly placed throughout the album to avoid repetition and due primarily to their rarity, these softer numbers emotional impact is increased exponentially.  <br />Furthermore, REM have no qualms about exposing their marketable side, providing the album with suitably high budget production values and never straying too far from a catchy riff or melody, even when employing the talents of the not so commercial Thurston Moore.  \\"Monster\\" therefore succeeds tremendously as both a sampling of the finer points of grunge and as another classic alt. rock album without alienating fans of either genre.  A band that's always been perfectly content with their past triumphs yet never eager to revel in them, REM will forever remain a respectable, active member of the alternative music community and \\"Monster\\" shows exactly why.
B00008J4P5|2.0|To put it bluntly, this album is horrible, the guitar riffs are soo unbelieveably simple and un-creative (ie seven nation army) I mean common, anyone could pick up a guitar and be able to play this stuff within 2 weeks. Then add in the repetative, non-dynamic drums, it makes for an agonizing, dreadful listen. spare yourself, please.
B00005JLSE|5.0|It's a been a long time since a Broadway musical rocked the attention of the film-going public in its celluloid version.  Indeed, the last such musical to win Best Picture at the Oscars was the classic OLIVER! in 1968.  While films like EVITA and GREASE made noble efforts in the following years, the Broadway musical genre seemed destined to be a faded memory.  Then came the success of 2001's MOULIN ROUGE which, although not based on a Broadway show, showed that inventive and well-done musicals can draw an appreciative audience.  In 2002, CHICAGO built on that momentum and brought the genre back into blazing life, while winning 6 Oscars in the process....including Best Picture. This clever, cynical satire tells the 1920's story of Roxie Hart, a young married woman who shoots her lover dead when he fails to promote her entertainment career.  In the Cook County Jail, she meets with other female killers including jazzy dance star, Velma Kelly.  Hart and Kelly soon find themselves competing for publicity, status, and even their hot-shot lawyer, Billy Flynn.    <br />As the somewhat innocent, yet ruthless Roxie Hart, Renee Zellweger does a wonderful job in balancing her two conflicting sides, while creating a character that grabs our interest.  Richard Gere is also top-notch as the slick lawyer Billy Flynn. It's a fun character-type role that easily grabs our attention.  John C. Reilly is winning as the meekish, put-upon husband to Roxie. Queen Latifah wonderfully underplays her role as the prison matron. And there's the definitive performance of Catherine Zeta-Jones as the sexy and sly Velma Kelly.  With her high energy, strong voice and wonderful dancing, Zeta-Jones creates a film performance that is as definitive in its own way as Ron Moody's Fagin in OLIVER! or Julie Andrew's Maria in SOUND OF MUSIC. She richly deserved the Oscar she won for Best Supporting Actress.  Rob Marshall directs this flick with a sure hand, and with a fast pace and style that makes the film seem much shorter than it actually is.<br />The DVD is pretty basic for the most part with a \\"Making of\\" featurette, a director/screenwriter commentary, as well as the deleted number, \\"Class,\\" which featured Zeta-Jones and Latifah. <br />In the end, CHICAGO is that rare bird: a film musical that remains true to the original, while maintaining its own integrity.  Like OLIVER!, SOUND OF MUSIC, and MY FAIR LADY, it deserves to stand the test of time as one of the great film recreations of Broadway, and it is definitely worth your time.
6302824729|5.0|The karate Kid Part 2 was alot better than the first.  Ralph macchio and pat Morita give excellent performances once agin. Daniel and Miyagi are awesome characters.  I think it's cool how they were able to make a series where two people such far apart in ages can be such great friends.  Anyway in Karate kid 2 Daniel and Miyagi travel to Okinawa after Miyagi gets word that his father has become very ill.  To make matters worse Miyagi has problem with sato his former best friend.  Really, Sato has a problem with Miyagi over an old girlfriend.  Daniel ends up having a problem of his own with Sato's nephew Chozen.  The last fight aganist Daniel and Chozen in the festival of the dead was awesome.
B00000JPHG|5.0|Who could possibly love Chucky?  Well, the girlfriend of the serial killer who inhabits his body, that's who. She's a piece of psycho work herself and when she can't get her lover out of a doll's body, he gets even and puts her into one.  Together they go on a &quot;romantic&quot; killing spree that includes a &quot;wedding&quot; of some sort though I doubt legal in any state.  Jennifer Tilly is just awesome as the &quot;bride&quot; and her &quot;human&quot; role is very creepy.  However, not creepy in a scary way, more creepy in a funny way -- dolls of a feather on killing sprees together.
B000002H6C|5.0|This was not after Metallica's peak. This was Metallica's peak. It's the last great album they produced. They fell apart when they released The Black Album. Everything from there to Garage, Inc. wasn't the greatest. But And Justice For All has to be one of the greatest songs ever made by them. The Top 3 have to be 1 - Hit The Lights, 2 - And Justice For All, 3 - Fight Fire With Fire.
B00000G28U|4.0|Don't judge a CD by its covers. This album features twenty-seven of them, spanning two discs (and more than two hours) of music. Garage Inc. picked up a bad reputation simply due to the fact that it was comprised entirely of cover songs, but since most of them are virtual unknowns, who cares? Essentially, Garage Inc. is a half-studio album; every song on Disc One was recorded just for Garage Inc., and is available nowhere else. The sixteen covers on Disc Two were all one-offs and B-sides recorded for past EP's, such as 1987's \\"The [money amount]E.P. - Garage Days Re-Visited.\\"<br />Many of the songs on Garage Inc. are covers of classic Diamond Head, Metallica's biggest influence. \\"So What\\" is an incredibly profane cover of an incredibly profane song released by the Anti-Nowhere League in 1981. There's even an acoustic song: Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" on Disc One. The compassionate \\"Turn the Page\\" shows lead vocalist James Hetfield's versatility as a singer, and at the same time features a killer guitar hook.<br />Some of the tracks on Garage Inc. are extremely long - Disc One's \\"Mercyful Fate,\\" which is actually a medley of songs from the band Mercyful Fate, clocks in at 11:10! Although the album is a hefty buy ([money maount], at the very least, unless you want a used copy), and although it's the first Metallica album to carry a Parental Advisory sticker, it's definitely worth it if you're desperate to complete your Metalli-collection.
B000077VR3|5.0|Well, the first time I saw this, I thought, &quot;What in the world was THAT?&quot; Then I couldn't stop humming the tunes. Next I wanted to rent it and see it again. I am a big classic, old time musical fan and am glad to get to see a modern day musical that holds up to the golden oldies. Romantic, great scenery. Don't try to make it something it's not. Just enjoy.
B000002J09|5.0|What is there left to say about this album?  It is usually acknowledged as Led Zeppelin's greatest album.  I am inclined to agree with that sentiment.  There is not a weak song on the whole album.  If you don't like this album, you must not like Led Zeppelin.
B00005JMK6|4.0|Romain Duris stars as Xavier, a just-graduated French student. The film picks up with him tentatively seeking out a Euroglot post-grauduate experience in Barcelona before commiting himself to a dreary life of French state bureaucracy.<br />Don't take that a Francaphobe comment.  Writer/Director Cedric Klapisch has done some excellent work in the editing room to show the silliness of bureaucratic structure in a Brussels-led European Community.  The film clicks along at triple-speed as it trails Xavier's ridiculous, labyrinthine walk through a cavernous government building in Paris to meet in some functionary's office.  Xavier's simple request as to how to apply for entry into the \\"Erasmus\\" study program is met with a recitation of forms, data, background info, etc. required.  Klapisch slaps a blizzard of paperwork up on the screen as the endless recital goes on and on.  It's a cute touch.<br />Xavier, however, can't really articulate *why* he wants to go to Barcelona, especially when pressed by girlfriend Martine, charmingly played (what else?) by Audrey Tautou.  Of course, when you leave Audrey Tautou behind for reasons you can't articulate, either the character or the film has problems.<br />In this case, it ends up being the character.  What Xavier really wants is not to be a bureaucrat all his life.  He just can't articulate that until he experiences Barcelona in a \\"Euro Pudding\\" setting.  With the movie's final twist, you realize that this film is an autobiographical piece from Klapisch telling us how he got to be who he is today.  Definitely worth checking out.
6303369170|4.0|I saw this movie few years back and wanted to see it again and finally found it on Region 2 DVD, in its full length version. The movie is dressed in Goran Bregovic's beautiful music, while the acting of Depp, Danaway and Lewis is captivating. It's not a movie for everyone, nor will all viewers understand what lies beneath the skin. I personally enjoyed every bit of the sweetness and sorrow, despair and hope that was artfully combined into this surreal blend of comedy and drama.
0156027321|4.0|By turns hilarious, brutal, believable, ridiculous, beautiful,  harrowing - ultimately an allegory. My complaint is that I wish it had stayed a story and not become openly a meditation on The Story. If you liked this book, try John Gardner's Grendel. I rank that 5 stars.
0590030299|5.0|I ABSOLUTLY ADORE THIS BOOK!!! IT IS SOOOOOO GOOD! I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ABSOLUTLY EVERYONE I MEET BECAUSE IT IS SO GOOD! (PEOPLE DO LOOK AT ME STRANGLY WHEN I STOP THEM ON THE STREET AND TELL THEM TO READ THIS BOOK THOUGH.) YOU'LL LOVE IT!  RUN; DON'T WALK, TO THE NEAREST STORE TO GET THIS RIGHT NOW!!!
B000059QY3|5.0|When I first heard the CD version of this opera I thought, that it was good , but certainly not worth all the fuss. Then I saw the DVD and WOW!!! This performance is simply spectacular.  When reviewing this work one must begin with Gheorghiu. She brings Violetta to life in a way that few performers have done before. First of all her singing is divine. She is in total control of her instrument and never falters. Second  she can act an art that is often missing or downplayed in opera today She is seductive in the opening act, tortured and remorseful in the second, and looking very sickly in the final stanza.. Lastly, as many others have said she is very attractive, which is always a plus especially in this role. Too often audiences are saddled with Violettas that are wonderful singers but frankly are not credible as being the object of Alfredo's desire. This is not the case here. Gheorghiu's natural beauty is accentuated by the wonderful costuming. However for those who think that Gheorghiu is all about glamour, look at the final act where her beauty is sacrificed for a very sickly look. The one knock I have against her performance is not attempting to hit the high E at the end of  the Folie! aria in act one. I do not quite understand why she chose to do this. Her voice was in stellar form and she is more then capable of hitting the note. None the less I understand the risk involved and have seen this note skipped on more then one occasion in this opera. However I must say that it  would have been a fine exclamation point on her beautiful rendition of this aria.<br />As for the rest of the cast, I must agree with one of the other reviewers in saying that a more lyric tenor then Lopardo would have been better. Alagna would be an obvious choice for me given his voice and his ability to compliment Gheorghiu's voice and vice versa. Doming would have been wonderful, however he is too old at this point for the role opposite Gheorghiu. Having said this, Lopardo does a credible job and does not detract from the performance though he is not spectacular. Nucci is fantastic as alfredo's father. His voice is in great form, and his performance is very refined. A wonderful choice for the role.<br />As for the rest of the production, Solti's conducting was rock solid as usual despite his advanced age. He was deeply involved in the production, and the orchestra showed it. The set was traditional, and the costumes were some of the best I have ever seen.<br />I must comment briefly here on those reviewers that rank this performance as a one or two star effort. These people are those that dislike Gheorghiu for whatever reason. They will never like anything she does because of a personal dislike for her, rather then the quality of her performance.<br />All in all this is a must buy.
B00005JLSE|3.0|With all the hype surronding Chicago, I expected a great movie but what I got was a decent music video that just happened to be almost 2 hours long.  The songs weren't that great and the story was the same as you would see watching what my grandmother calls her stories on daytime television.  It's lone saving grace was Renee Zellweger who was fun to watch and made me laugh several times. This movie is worth seeing but i don't think I would want to own it. The disc itself looks good and the sound is great but for a Best Picture winner I expected more than the single disc version given here, I think we will be seeing a 2 disk Special Edition soon so if you must have this film on dvd go ahead and get this one but don't be surprised when a better version shows up in 4-6 months.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album is as close to perfection as a rock band can every get. Every song on this album is a masterpiece. From mellow, dark and very personal songs like &quot;So cruel&quot;, &quot;Love is blindness&quot; to dancy songs like &quot;Mysterious ways&quot;, &quot;Even Better than the real thing&quot; to powerful rocks songs with scathing sarcasm and great music like &quot;Acrobat&quot;,  &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Until the end of the world&quot;. Everyone does a great job in this album. This album is a must have.
0064430227|5.0|I LOVE this book! It is soooooo cute! Harold draws everything! I really like the policeman! And the hot air balloon! And how he drew a boat to keep himself from sinking in the sea he drew! The whole book is just soooooo cute! I absolutely love it! You should but it NOW if you don't already have it! I LOVE crayons too! ... My favorite color crayon is Tickle me Pink! And I really like Granny Smith Apple Green too! The names are just so much fun!
B0000AI44Q|4.0|There's just something that grips you when you listen to the album for the first time.  It's raw.  It's powerful.  It's good.<br />Neil Young's latest album &quot;Greendale&quot; is a story-driven concept album, almost to the point where one could consider it a rock-opera.  The difference between this rock-opera and others (i.e. Tommy, The Wall) is that Young allows for a raw, almost under-produced sound, the sound he's become known for in his live performances with Crazy Horse.  But it's not just those long-rockin' songs a la &quot;Cowboy in the Sand&quot; that are the jewels of this album.  Young introduces a touch of smooth R&amp;B, relaxed country, and hearty rock-a-billy into both the music and his lyrics in that lazy care-free style that only he could deliver.  Whether you're a fan of early works like &quot;Harvest&quot; or later works like &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; you'll enjoy this back-to-basics sound of Neil Young at his best.  Oh yeah, make sure to check out the DVD too.  Definitely a worth-while purchase.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|What can you say, Beauty and the Beast in DVD mastered goodness.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets gets a lot of praise on these review sheets.  I can see why. I am 15, and i discovered this album a year ago. I was listening to more contemporary music at the time, and after hearing this, i realised just how bad most of the music around today is.  Even Metallica have gone downhill from ...And Justice For All (Black album is a little too mainstream)<br />Anyway, back to the (front) point.  This album is not only fast, heavy and melodic, but it is also intelligent.  That is what defined (past tense!) Metallica from most of its rivals in the 80's metal scene.  The songs MEAN something, take, for example disposable heroes, an anti-war song, Master of Puppets, an anti-drug anthem (somewhat odd for a metal band you might think) or Welcome Home (Sanitarium) the thoughts of an inmate in a mental asylum.<br />Each song has been thought through and planned with pedantic accuracy.  The Metallica of today churns out songs like there's no tomorrow (in my opinion, St. Anger is OK, but nothing special)  The difference here is that Metallica actually use what brains they have to produce music with a heart, a living, breathing meaningful SOUL.  This is what music today lacks.<br />James Hetfield is a clever man, he just didn't show it until Ride The Lightning, and the brain went when he entered the studio to record Load, he is the brain behind the brawn.<br />Each song is heavy, each song has at least one fast section, each song sounds similar, each song has a different meaning and a different soul.  Long live Master of Puppets.<br />15/Kent/England

Anyway, Max imagines a forest growing in his room! I wish I had a forest in my room! I LOVE trees! And this book! Max meets wild things! My brothers are wild things! I meet them all the time! This is a great book! You should buy it!
B00005JMC6|5.0|I was a little reluctant to see the movie, as I had not heard much about it except for one excellent reccomendation from a friend, and I knew very little about the movie. However, I decided to take the chance and make this one of the, maybe 3, movies I see a year at a theater. All I can say is that I am very very glad I did so. Whale rider was an amazing movie, and it was very very touching. I never cry at movies, and I was quite suprised when, at one part, I actually found tears running down my face. The performance by the girl, Pai, was excellent, and suprising for a young actress. This is a movie I will be likely to see again.
6305897786|5.0|If you know what a Rider Waitt deck is, this movie will make a LOT more sense then it does for most reviewers. Depps on the journey of the fool,  The mystery girls actions are dependent on Depps use of free will - her roll is summed up nicely in the last scene.<br />And this review will make no sense to most people reading it - like the movie made no sense to them. Its an insider thing.
B00007LL7O|5.0|If your a fan of bands that can actually play then Stratovarius is right up your alley.  I've been told that Dream Theater are the masters of the Progressive/Power Metal arena but (even tho John is an insane guitarist) I think they've been ursurped.  The problem I find with most of the progressive metal bands is that they are shred driven.. the guitarist seems to want to show that he can shred 24/7 which is great but it lacks the &quot;soul&quot; that makes great music (and yes I play guitar).  Stratovarius doesn't have this problem, even though Timo Tolkki can shred when necessary, their songs never seem to lack the emotional quality necessary.  <br />Soul of a Vagabond absolutly knocked my off my chair the first time I listened to it.  The riff is great and that drum is absolutly intense, but when Kotipelto comes in and everything fades out except for the bass and drum lines... you just can't help but feel the longing in his voice.<br />And I'm not even going to get into the shredfest of stratofortress... my fingers hurt just listening to that.<br />Excellent album by an incredible band... I can't recommend either highly enough.
0064407667|1.0|This book was absolutely horrible! I mean, really! The whole series is crazy! I mean, what's the point! The books are awful! I mean, everything comes out happily, but no, can't have them actually being HAPPY! No, no, it's like being happy is against all the rules! It was awful! I don't see why everyone else thinks it is so good! It is NOT good! Don't get this book!
0553260111|2.0|has anyone else noticed that most of the reviews for any product on amazon are all five stars, written by people who \\"aboslutely loved this book/cd/dvd/whathaveyou\\"?<br />okay, well with that said, the Bourne Identity wasn't terrible, but it wasn't particularly good either.  While I was reading it, I couldn't help but think it was perfect to send to hollywood as a move plot and lo and behold, poof.  The story line has an interesting premise (a man wakes up with amnesia on a fishing boat and the only clue to his identity is a microchip that was implanted in his body...)  but it starts to read a little predictably after that, just like a typical hollywood blockbuster should.  enter the love interest who will help him understand who he really is and change him through her love, a chase across europe and the united states ensues, etc. etc.  it's good mind-numbing reading, but don't expect anything monumentally novel and ground-breaking or life changing.  I actually think I liked the movie better, at least, I don't expect as much from hollywood as I do from a book.
0385504209|5.0|Although I have previously read most of the information in this book, I was fascinated at the way the author put it together to create a page turner you couldn't put down, and that could haunt your dreams as well as give you marvelous ideas to discuss with your friends.  The chapters are just &quot;bite-sized&quot;, and each seems to end with a little mystery you just know will be solved in the next.  You have to keep reading &quot;just one more chapter&quot;<br />Some of it is facts, some speculation, some fiction.  Its hard to know which is which, and the implications and possibilities are going to really make people think about what they really know about Jesus and Magdalene, the Templars, Masons, the Gnostics, pre-christian religions, secret societies, and the symbology of ancient religions.<br />Scotty Zilinsky
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This was in my opinion a fun and original comedy.<BR>I am not a Hugh Grant fan, but he has done a good job in this movie.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I'm going to side with a lot of the folks that disliked this album and pretty much for every reason they state. This is not an enjoyable album for repeat listening. Nothing quite jells. This will be in the cut-out bin before too long.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Profound, artistic, quirky, humorous. Full of life. What an exquisite journey.
B00005RHGK|3.0|This movie has its ups and downs. Probably more downs than ups. The best part is probably the scene where they are followed by the truck/van thing. The rest of it though feels a little tiring, considering the majority of the movie is filmed while they are driving. It's not worth buying but it is a good rental. Funny to laugh at during some parts. I was a little let down when I saw this, so don't go in to watching it expecting it to be the best film ever made.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this CD.  I bought it because of the single &quot;bring me to life&quot; but that's not even my favorite song on the cd.  I've always wondered what it would be like to have a tori amos or sarah mclauglin (sp) work with a rock group and now I know.  The cd is perfect for me when I need a boost of energy I can't wait for their next outing.  But like the other reviewer I am a little concerned about how they'll handle it and whether it will hinder them next time.  Lets hope not.  GREAT CD, go get it!
B00009P1O0|5.0|Of the four albums from Neil Young's back catalog finally being released on CD in August 2003, \\"On The Beach\\" is by far the most sparkling jewel of the lot. Neil's fan's having been waiting a long, long time for this great album to get a CD release. My old vinyl copy sounds like hell after all these years, so I jumped on this the day it was released. (In fact I jumped on all four of the reissues the day they were released, but the other three do not come close to \\"On The Beach\\".) I don't even know where to start in singing its praises. Every song is good, most are great, \\"Walk On\\" and \\"Revolution Blues\\" are fine rockers, \\"See The Sky About To Rain\\" is lovely, and \\"Vampire Blues\\" takes a great swipe at the oil industry. (\\"I'm a vampire baby, sucking blood from the earth. I'm a vampire baby, sell you twenty barrels worth\\".) But it is on the later, quieter songs that the album shines the brightest. The final three songs, \\"On The Beach\\", \\"Motion Pictures\\", and \\"Ambulance Blues\\" are simply stunning. I rank this album as being in the top three or four in Neil's long, illustrious career. No fan should be without it.
B000002JNG|3.0|Plant welcomed the 1990's in with a solid effort, &quot;MANIC NIRVANA&quot;. HURTING KIND is full of power cord action, but, Robert's vocal cords cannot meet the song's demands. A solid song, it's just that Robert sounds 62 instead of 42. BIG LOVE is a jokey throw away. Plant's vocals still are strained. SSS &amp; Q starts off with a blistering Doug Boyle solo and then does not really go anywhere from there. Plant sounds slightly better and there is a cool, brief James Brown sample. Also, note the Prince influence in the latter part of the song. I CRIED is a nice production. It is built on angelic Plantisms over Boyle's strumming and features Robert's best vocal effort on the LP. A nice tune. SHE SAID starts with a synthesized Wayne and Garth flashback sound and then an awful Plant vocal croak. Fortunately, he gives an ambitious vocal performance from that point, over driving guitar (at times U2ish) and drum work. Boyle is very creative here. There is a very nice break 2/3rd's of the way through with Phil Johnstone's synthesizer getting some room to breathe. One of Plant's best (and underrated) rock songs. NIRVANA picks up where SHE SAID left off. Another of Plant's best solo rock songs. Very 90's and quite progressive, you are never sure where it is going on the 1st listen. Boyle shines again, with a nod to The Edge. TIE DIE ON THE HIGHWAY was the 1st or 2nd single as I recall. Complete with Woodstock samples to set the mood. More power cord rock with some nice breaks. This song would have fit nicely on Plant's 1st solo effort. A solid song. YOUR MA SAID YOU CRIED LAST NIGHT is Robert doing &quot;Froggy went a Courting&quot;. Junk. ANNIVERSARY is &quot;Chariot's of Fire&quot; with lyrics and a guitar solo. OK fodder I suppose. LIAR'S DANCE is Robert accompanied with only an amped acoustic guitar and is very quirky and pleasing. His vocals are as pure and unfiltered as they get on this LP. Here is Led Zeppelin III. WATCHING YOU closes out the album with a drum driven, mood piece full of &quot;Over the Mountain, Over the Sea&quot; type cliches. Plant throws in his Indian influences (How could he resist?) to neat effect. Heavy on production and vocal manipulations, this LP is Plant's last opportunity to really rock. It's a good listen.
B00009P1O5|3.0|Of the four albums from Neil Young's back catalog that have finally been issued on CD (for the first time) in August 2003, \\"Re-ac-tor\\", originally released in 1981, is the least interesting. It probably seemed like a great idea at the time - an album consisting of pure, 100% Crazy Horse rockers - something that Neil had never done before. But even Crazy Horse needs some goods songs to work with, and good songs are in short supply here. (In 1990 Neil took another crack at the same concept, with much better results, on \\"Ragged Glory\\".) In spite of the shortcomings, there are some distinct pleaures to be found on \\"Re-ac-tor\\". The highlight, by a longshot, is \\"Shots\\", a nearly 8 minute long burst of frenzied, distorted guitar married to the album's best melody. It ranks right up there with previous classics like \\"Southern Man\\", \\"Like A Hurricane\\", and \\"Down By The River\\". After that, there is a sharp drop off in quality to a few moderately interesting songs such as \\"Opera Star\\", \\"Surfer Joe And Moe The Sleaze\\", \\"Southern Pacific\\", and \\"Rapid Transit\\". The rest would likely be of interest only to fanatics. One other song merits mention - \\"T-Bone\\", a 9-plus-minute angry rocker with the only lyrics being \\"Got mashed potatoes, ain't got no t-bone\\", repeated ad-nauseum. Maybe it's Neil's commentary on hunger, he sure does seem ticked-off about that potato diet, but it's just too repetitive to really be of much interest. Crazy Horse sounds good though, even on the most mediocre songs, so Neil's more enthusiastic fans (including me) will want to have this. Casual fans can certainly get by without it.
B000003S0B|3.0|It's tough to follow up a debut like *In the Court of the Crimson King*, so you can't really blame Robert Fripp for trying to give us Crimson King Mark II.  Nor can you say that he fails entirely: there are some moments of real beauty on here and a few mind-bending, amp-shredding solos which owe more to free jazz than to rock.  (&quot;Cat Food&quot; is particularly recommended for the guitar-piano interplay).  <br />Still, this is not one of King Crimson's most interesting releases.  Greg Lake was beginning his slow spiral into pomposity: &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; has all the pretension of &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; but none of the eerie beauty or tasteful musical flourishes.  There's nothing as breathtaking as &quot;Moonchild&quot; or &quot;I Talk to the Wind.&quot; (although &quot;Cadence and Cascade&quot; comes close).  Fripp was still in the process of finding his voice -- or, given the incredible diversity of material he has produced since, voices.  <br />This is a good CD, far better than much &quot;progressive rock.&quot;  But it's not indispensible.  The debut, and &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; are King Crimson at its finest: this is King Crimson working a groove.  Given Fripp's intense creativity, I can see why he regularly changes his sound.  He played orchestral prog-rock for all it was worth on &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; ... indeed, he may have said all he had to say in that vein.
B000053VAZ|5.0|In the last ten years box offices have seen so many bad romantic comedies that it's hard to believe directors even try anymore. Even the ones that aren't awful aren't necessarily good, for example most of Meg Ryan and Jennifer Lopez's movies don't qualify as either. However, after I saw Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns in the horrific chick-flick `Life or Something Like It' I had to ask myself: \\"Has there ever been a good romantic comedy? Why do people still see these things? Isn't it obvious that the genre of romantic-comedy is a completely lost cause?\\" Then I saw this movie. If `Benny and Joon' is nothing else, it is solid proof that there is such a thing as a good romantic comedy. <br />Aidan Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson play dysfunctional siblings, Benny and Joon Pearl. Benny is a car mechanic whose dull life revolves around taking care of his mentally unstable sister, Joon. The climax of Benny's week takes during poker night with his friends. On one arbitrary night, Benny takes Joon with him, Joon ends up playing and looses. Benny and his friends always play for keeps, and as a result of Joon's loss is Benny has to take his friend's illiterate cousin, Sam (Johnny Depp), home with him. <br />Sam is polite and curious and Benny decides to keep him around when he inadvertently cleans the whole house during his first day with the Pearls.  As time goes on, Sam's presence forces Benny and Joon to recognize long unrealized problems in their relationship, while simultaneously allowing Joon to indulge a side of herself she never knew existed. <br />`Benny and Joon' strikes a perfect balance between quirky and adorable, and is rather Romeo-and-Juliet-like in its ability to make an audience care about what happens to a pair of very star-crossed lovers. The astonishingly real characters and the fact that they're played by exquisitely well cast actors is probably this movies best asset in a technical sense. Aside from that I think this movie's best point, is that it is absolutely unrivaled as the best romantic comedy I've ever seen in my life.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I guess I was fortunate to not have any expectations when I saw the movie for I had not yet read the book.  So in terms of just a movie the Bourne Identity is awesome!!!  Everything fits together really well and there were no holes.  For a spy movie that's very rare.  But this movie had very little flaws.  While it's hard to say anything about the movie without giving away the bigger picture, I can say both Matt Damon and Franka Potente played their roles extremely well.  Matt Damon was convincing as a martial arts expert/spy while Franka Potente was believable as an innocent beautiful bystander just trying to help...  And when I say beautiful I mean BEAUTIFUL.  What a gorgeous lady she is, on and off the camera!  And her beauty exudes in this film.  <br />There are other good things about this movie besides the credible acting!  There were some great fight scenes, which Matt Damon was quite good in.  The plot was superb with very little/to no holes in it.  It was both intriguing and suspenseful and had and ambiance about it that's hard to describe.  The superb cinematography was partially responsible for this but what I think added to the feel and really brought this movie to life was the musical score!  It did everything a good score does.  It brought you to the edge of your seat when it wanted you there or calmed you down when it was time to be calm.  From the opening credits the music presented suspense and mystery!  If you get a chance check out the score!  It's awesome to listen to by itself!  On top of this, the movie has one of the most fun car chases with Matt Damon behind the wheel of an old school Mini!  While in the background is an awesome song by Paul Oakenfold called \\"Ready Steady Go\\" from his new CD Bunkka.  <br />All in all this movie was great but there is a problem with it.  Though, it's only a problem if you make it one.  The novel by Robert Ludlum for which the movie is named is quite different.  With the exception of the basic premise of JasonBourne and who he is, the two stories have few things in common.  If you're a fan of the book you will be disappointed in how different it is.  On the flip side if you can watch the movie impartially, chances are it will take on it's own existence and will be enjoyable.  As I stated previously, I hadn't read the book before I watched the movie.  Though the movie did inspire me to read it.  This kept me impartial while watching the movie.  The book was very awesome but it was so unbelievably different that I recognize both as there own entity.  <br />If you're a fan of the book don't expect too much from this movie and I'm sure you will enjoy it for what it is, an action packed suspense mystery!  If you like the movie, then check out the book.  But be forewarned, the book is old school!  Some of the references to technology will make you chuckle if you're young or make you reminisce if you're older.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|The more time goes by, the more amazing Cher gets! Was in awe of her when she was on T.V. and have stayed in love for 30 years. Her cocert live was the highlight of my life and this DVD lets me relive that night over and over again. Should have 10 stars for being so awesome. If you missed this live, you must see this video! if you were there you can relive every moment of this killer concert. Unforgetable!!!
0790742780|5.0|This movie seems to exude feelings that the average Joe has everyday in this country.  The disgust and utter contempt one feels for the injustices occurring everywhere.  This movie is 10 years old but has just as much meaning in the new Millennia as it did in the 90's.  It's about an average man, Bill Foster played by Michael Douglas, on the verge of cracking.  He's lost his wife to a divorce, lost custody of his daughter, and lost his job.  It takes the painful LA traffic and a broken air conditioner in his car to push him over the edge.  Thus starts his journey.  This movie is his story and his trek through LA to get back home.  It's about his abhorrence of everything wrong and he's not afraid to make it known.  This movie seems to convey the thoughts of many people in the US and it helps one empathize with his character.  You can't help routing for this guy.  He's just trying to make it home and bad things keep happening.  They get progressively worse and he gets progressively more violent.  Some of the things he does will make you want to cheer.  But in the grand scheme of things you feel sad for him.  <br />This movie is unique in the fact that there's not a true protagonist and a true antagonist.  Robert Duvall plays a cop, Prendergast, who is very similar to Michael Douglas' character.  He too is plagued by problems and he's such a warm character in the movie that one can't help but feel sorry for him.  His wife is having a nervous breakdown, and his only daughter passed away.  He has a desk job now because his wife wanted him off the streets and he's at his last day at work because he's retiring.  The other cops at the precinct, with exception to his partner, all give him a hard time.  During his last day he gets reports of incidences that he thinks are caused by the same person.  These incidences are in fact caused by Michael Douglas' character...And Robert Duvall wants to stop him.<br />So it becomes good guy vs. not so bad guy.  A cop vs. a self-made vigilante.  Who do you route for??  This is a sad movie that depicts what might happen if a regular Joe Schmoe were to snap.<br />The story, combined with great performances and an awesome, and I do mean awesome, musical score, makes this movie well worth seeing!  It's a very powerful movie that is funny at times and sad at others.  Anyone who's ever been angry at something will enjoy this movie.  Oh... if you're not sane please don't watch this movie.  It will give you ideas.
B000002H2Z|4.0|A good album to start with the Cure.  It isn't dark and gloomy like a lot of their stuff.  I think the best of Robert Smith's songwriting comes through when he concentrates on upbeat yet quirky ballads.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|The absolute best Whitney offering there is...period. Though it was distributed before Fine and If I Told You That, this DVD is still the $h*t. Though Whitney may have picked some bad wigs to rock, she still looks beautiful and sound wonderful. She may not be able to SANG anymore, but the woman still can SING her clothes off.

034544678X|5.0|Being involved in the pet industry, I have read many dog books- training, behavior, care, etc. This in is my list of top 5. <br />After reading this book, I see dogs in a different light. I am more conscious of how they interpret our body language, how they use theirs, and how to communicate with them more effectively. This is very important to me, not only because I deal with dogs continuously, but especially because I share my home with a couple of rescued dogs with issues that I can now help ease. And Patricia McConnell explains it all in such an entertaining way... I couldn't put the book down! Between her captivating style of writing and the amazing information in this book, this book deserves every one of the five stars I am giving it. <br />Every dog-lover should have this one!
630512762X|1.0|I used to like this movie when it came out. I must've been about 14 when it saw it, and I found the acion scenes to be nice, some explosions and stunts were good, the story was entertaining, and the acting wasn't that bad!<br />That was until I saw John Woo's classics &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; and &quot;The Killer&quot; years afterward. I mean, of course when Hollywood gets ahold of Woo after noticing his ground-breaking material, would they decide to make him (and themselves, more importantly) rich with repitition.<br />Uggh, I'll stick with his Hong Kong classics before I step foot into this pile again.

B00007KMP1|5.0|That this recording is masterful in normal two-channel stereo is not in question.  It's the 5.1 Surround SACD version that brings 'Sea Change' to an entirely new level.  If you have heard only the stereo recording, to overuse a cliche, you ain't heard nothin' yet!
B00008X5J3|5.0|Where do you even start with a five star movie? Unbelievable costumes, writing, directing, adaptation for the screen, excellent acting, the five star cast was even delightful while singing/dancing/tapping, and a fabulous storyline to boot!       The theatrical side of this movie is outstanding. There are no computer graphic simulations, this is a visual masterpiece done the old fashioned way. Thought provoking writing in the script, dealing with our justice system also makes it a wonderful choice for those who like to contemplate but is a visual stunner for those artistic types who just like to watch a great movie. Pep, hot jazz, tap dancing, singing all done by the actors themselves, does leave 'sequins in your eyes'...the songwriting for this original Broadway show is adapted perfectly for the screen: not too long or too short.       If you haven't seen this movie, don't rent it--just go buy it. You'll want to see it over and over again. It is worth every penny.
B000069HKH|1.0|I have been a fan of Bruce's since 78, his music has been the soundtrack to my life from a teenager cruising on Friday night through parenting young children. Bruce always had something to say to help me through to good and bad times, and his albums have been in regular rotation 25 years on my turntable or cd player.  <br />Having experienced the greatest tragedy we've ever faced as a nation, I was hopeful about the Rising.  Having listened closely to the album and attended the concerts, I am deeply disappointed in Bruce and seriously questioning his vision and insight.  He offers trite platitudes, mindless partying and sex, (w/whomever is handy at the moment), to ease the pain.  <br />This album is a slap in the face to the victims and survivors of 9/11.  It is gratuitous and shallow.  The track titled \\"Paradise\\" offers aid and comfort to those who heartlessly and callously killed the brothers Bruce supposedly laments, whose blood cries from the ground.  Factoring in heavily in my level of disgust is the fact that this album was billed so heavily as post 9/11 healing, yet he's stuffing his pockets with untold millions by capitalizing on the blood of the 9/11 victims.  Every dime of profit should have gone to the victims families, somehow I doubt the working class hero would have been willing to work so hard if his own financial interests were not at stake.<br />Bruce, sadly, has become another hypocritical limosine liberal.  The man who wrote \\"Mansion on the Hill\\" now finds himself living in the same mansion.  The billionaire working class hero is a phony act I can no longer abide. It's sad to see your heroes fall, but Bruce has fallen, hard, with this piece of drivel and the resulting tour.    My level of disgust for Bruce could not be any deeper, considering the high esteem in which I once held him.
B00005JKC3|2.0|I saw this in the theater not on DVD, nor do I plan to watch the DVD. I enjoyed the Hulk-smash bits, who wouldn't? I also liked how they used cutting to give it the feel of being in a graphic novel, but otherwise it was pretty much a snoozer. It tried to be psychologically interesting but failed. I like the Hulk and really wanted to like this movie, but I was bored. And the one scene where you were actually interested in what happens, the final fight. You couldn't see it because of poor lighting and poor animation. I'm still not sure how this movie ended, and sadly I don't really care. Maybe they will add in more scenes and make this movie more interesting, but I'm not sure that's possible.
B00009V7P8|5.0|What I am to you is not real<br />What I am to you you do not need<br />What I am to you is not what you mean to me<br />You give me miles and miles of mountains<br />and I'll ask for the sea<br />~Volcano<br /><br />Within this melancholy land of thoughts and brightness filling empty space, a voice cries out in search of love.<br /><br />If Volcanoes melt you down, this song will melt you into a realization that at times your desires may be flooding out into the world, while the heat of your passions leave others cold. They are like the cold oceans solidifying the volcanic flow and you tend to have to keep climbing mountains instead of flowing freely as the passionate soul you were meant to be. At least this song had this meaning for me.<br /><br />I have no idea what the rest of the song means, but does that matter? I have what I need from the song. For me it is about the desperate search for meaning and for wanting to be real in the eyes of the person you love the most in the world.<br /><br />Damien Rice is a singer/songwriter from County Kildare, Ireland. What is it about Damien Rice's voice that makes us melt with him in spirit? Is it the dreamy way he says: \\"can't take my eyes off of you\\" or the pure sensitivity, longing and almost delicate vulnerability in the way the song takes off into: \\"Did I say that I want you to?\\" Lisa Hanningan is obviously part of the haunting qualities and when their voices mingle, it is magical.<br /><br />The lyrics in \\"Older Chests\\" are some of my favorites because they paint pictures for me in my mind. I love when Damien says: \\"Read me Your favorite Lines\\" or \\"Pass me By, I'll be fine.\\" There is a sense of timelessness, a sense of resolution.<br /><br />\\"Cold Water\\" is rather chilling at first and reminds me of a scene from Titanic. I'm not so sure I am comfortable with how slowly the song is paced at one point, yet it takes off again rather quickly. It is beautiful if you put it in perspective and know it was influenced by a monk who composed Gregorian chants in an abbey in the south of France.<br /><br />\\"I Remember\\" is intense in comparison to the rest of the album, the volume of pain at times deafening. This is the most difficult, yet most exciting selection.<br /><br />If you are depressed while listening to this CD, Damien's lyrics are going to be much more meaningful. Yet there is beauty in the depths.<br /><br />Eskimo is at first hidden in a cool plateau of calm moments. As if you were literally sitting on ice waiting for this song to take off into echoes when Doreen Curran sings the last verse in Intuit. How could one have expected this song to explain the title of the album? For me, it does.<br /><br />For listening when you are down, down, down. Then the cycle begins again. The cycle of relationships, the cycle of life, the cycle of love and loss. Never expect normality, \\"O\\" is the cycle of life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewance.     \\"I Remember\\" is intense in comparison to the rest of the album, the volume of pain at times deafening.

0312263120|5.0|Great book - Ignore the reviews from the folks who spend more time analyzing the minutia of the book than actually reading it and enjoying it.  It's a good book to read and enjoy, finished it in 24 hours.
B00009P1O5|5.0|When rating NY's recordings this often ends up towards the bottom of the list and I felt the same way.  I'm listening to the Remastered version now and I don't know if my taste has matured or the remastering is masterful but I'd put this in his top 5.
0142004235|5.0|John Steinbeck is at his best in this classic tale of sibling rivalry as he examines what we become vs. what we *may* become.  The Biblical tale of Cain and Abel sets the tone as we are introduced to two sets of brothers.  Each tries to win the love of his father in different ways.  The story of why one brother succeeds while another feels unloved is beautifully told.<br />Adam Trask, from the first set of brothers, repeats his own story with his sons, the twins Aron and Caleb.  The enduring themes of light vs. dark, good vs. evil, hatred vs. love, and always the free will, the ability to choose one's own destiny are paramount to this rich and multi-layered tale.<br />Above all, it is the characters you will long remember from this riveting saga.  Cathy, the whore with a heart of stone, has to be one of the most evil characters in all literature.  She kills her parents, beds her husband's brother on her wedding night, shoots her husband and desserts her infant sons.  And, all this before she turns really bad!  Truly a character to be analyzed for decades to come.  On the other hand there are the wonderful characters of Samuel and Lee, men you will long remember for their wisdom, caring, and sheer goodness.  And there is Adam, a zombie of a man until his great re-birth and spectacular failure finds him caught in a web of good and evil that he will long struggle with.<br />John Steinbeck puts himself into the novel, as Samuel Hamilton is based on his own maternal grandfather.  The entire Hamilton clan is one that represents the true \\"salt of the earth\\" and elevates this to \\"great American novel\\" stature.<br />The story is complex and involving, the characters unforgettable.  Kudos to Oprah for reviving interest in this wonderful story.

B0000000LI|1.0|Yanni fans and others have come to expect from him &quot;music&quot; that provokes landscape images, religious symbolism, and cultural...ZZZZZ.ZZZZZZZZZZZ. Anyway, the fact is his music has never been the same since his departure from german rock band, the Scorpions. His presence was felt on a few early recordings and fans may have noticed the difference upon its absence. Yanni has completely left behind all previous styles and taken on a new identity in the world music genre. The Album is over the top and over long and will definitely take you into another realm - one in which you may not want to be - So Yanni heads will appreciate it. The only really unique aspect of Acropolis is the out of place appearance of Rob Halford (Judas Priest). I would really like to know how he agreed to appear on it. The unknown Twisted Sister cover song is absent once again - It may not even exist on bootleg. Yanni fans will like this but if you know his metal roots its a little hard to take in.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|(good thing I can still type.)<br />Old  mid-40's fan, but haven't followed every new release for a long time now. (Sleeps w/ Angels, Year of the Horse DVD, Ragged Glory, Freedom are my purchases of &quot;new&quot; NY of last 10 yrs or so.)<br />Had friends who saw tour.  Most all differed in opinion: genius, stupid, funny, sad, silly, subtle, provactive, boring, too preachy, powerful political satire, corny.<br />Re: this CD/DVD all of the above appear to be simultaneously valid opinions as you listen to first songs on disc and scratch yr head.  But then it begins to demand that you wrestle w/ it and read the accompanying narrative in order to keep things straight.  By album's end it becomes even more clear that if you've ever been a fan of Neil's that this is a work to be reckoned with as both lyric and text (or on DVD, narration).<br />It's subject matter is ultimately an allegorical take on many things besides Greendale's characters: Neil as the artist reflecting on his career; American media, big biz, law enforcement and consumer demand; true justice; nature and environment; spirit.  <br />I went to bed and watched the solo DVD which has Young doing the entire disc in sequence w/ lots of narration between. By song 6, &quot;grandpa's interview&quot; I was laughing even as tears were brimming.  And the tears then spilled over in spots across the last 3 songs.<br />Folks, even w/ my 5 stars above, I'm not going to go out and declare it one of his greatest works or among the best of '03 based on my limited experience and my emotional response. His best melodies, production, or singing?  Perhaps not. Best lyrics?  Another story, b/c the &quot;corniness&quot; is right there creating the much deeper content.  And of course Mr. Young is not to everyone's tastes.<br />But for fans who are at the same time concerned about the themes I listed above, I can assure you this album cannot be easily dismissed.  I will also guess that many of you may cry as well. I'm not prone to tears in movies, much less music. Ultimately, it feels like an elegy for 2k3-forward America with the hope for redemption lying now with a generation other than Neil's and mine, namely youth in touch w/ nature-spirit and a sense of activism that puts justice and the &quot;calling out&quot; of liars and exploiters of every stripe at the forefront of its agenda.<br />Maybe someone else can speak as a non-fan who has experience this CD/DVD package. But if you are a long time fan and familiar w/ (and forgiving of) the man's quirks, just buy yourself one now and several others that you can have sent to like-minded friends.

B00006M183|5.0|If you're one of those people saying PJ are done and their best albums were Ten and Vs. - stop reading.  I hope I never hear Alive, Evenflow, or Jeremy on the radio again.  I'll take what they've done on their last three albums over their first two anyday.<br />Given to Fly (Yield), Light Years (Binaural), and LBC or Save You off Riot Act are all excellent examples of their maturity in both songwriting and musicianship.  <br />Obviously Ten and Vs. have some great songs but they're so 10 years ago. This band is only getting tighter.  Do yourself a favor and give the newer PJ a listen, you might be surprised when you compare it to all of the other derivative crap that's being played on rock radio.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I first heard these songs a month or two ago when the Dublin concert appeared on Neil's website. Since then I've heard them in various forms on his web site, and live at the Concord, CA concert. Having had a chance to live with them for awhile, I'm still a bit unclear on exactly how Neil manages to come up with so many catchy hooks that reel the listener in and leaving him gasping for more. I probably heard them in concert at just the ideal time, when I was getting to know them, and had not yet had a chance to get too much of them. So its difficult to be objective. The concert was just too much fun.<br />The album is here now, and I have to come back to earth, and decide if the songs are really as strong as a good north western, or if I was just carried away by the warm summer air pulsing with Ralph Molina's uncharacteristically steady rhythm. Overall, I would have to say that yes, they do stand up. There is, of course, a certain mood that permeates all the songs, they definitely appear to be blown into town by the same storm, but I don't think they sound too much alike.<br />One of the strange things about the album is its clarity. I love listening to Sampredo, but I think having him sit this one out allowed Crazy Horse working as a trio to create an unusually unmuddied sound. Its a bit like the kind of clarity on Landing on Water, but without the bad vibes.<br />Melodically, Neil seems to be working hard at his minimalist approach to composition. Nothing seems very complicated here. It sounds like Neil turned his sails to the wind and let the mood carry him directly home to a safe harbor. The opposite of the belabored sense one gets from a good Joni Mitchell or Steely Dan composition. These melodies seem not so much composed as simply captured. The end effect is very satisfying.<br />Here the strongest songs are probably the rockers, with \\"double-e\\", \\"devil's sidewalk\\", \\"sun grean\\" and \\"be the rain\\" standing out. \\"Carmichael\\" probably deserves special notice for its strong emotional pull. Overall, what we have here is Neil in troubadour mode, singing the songs of the time, capturing the best spirit of an age. We're in a dark era when the country in general and the music business in particular seems to be caught in a sluggish and murky nightmare. So its good to hear one nationally known voice coming out with something new and interesting. I would suggest that other artists listen to hear what Neil is doing right, but I'm afraid the key ingredient here is probably raw talent that has somehow remained uncorrupted. Maybe we could all work on the uncorrupted part.ts strong emotional pull. Overall, what we have here is Neil in troubadour mode, singing the songs of the time, capturing the best spirit of an age.

B00008S2VG|1.0|even Madonna and Like A Virgin had more creativity than this. heck, I'd even say I'm Breathless is better. Before all you Madonna fans go saying i'm just another hater, well think again. I have been a HARDCORE M fan since 1993. I have over 200 Madonna items in my collection and she is my favorite artist so my opinion is valid. This album is WEAK. I'm wondering if she didn't just dig out some MUSIC throwaways and gather them up to make this CD. The title track is a cut and paste MESS, salvageable only by the Felix Da Housecat and Oakenfold remixes found on the maxi-single. Hollywood is a simplistic bore. Nothing Fails is THE Most Overrated Madonna Song EVER. This is not a &quot;masterpice&quot; people. A masterpice is Live To Tell. A masterpiece is Oh Father. A masterpice is Ray Of Light. Nothing Fails is a generic rehash ballad. X-Static Process puts me to sleep faster than a bottle of NyQuil. The vocals on Mother And Father are EMBARASSING. The only truly great song on this album is Intervention. That is a great song, the others are not.<br />Madonna, i sincerely hope you actually give it a little effort with your next album cuz this one STINKS. And I'm NOT sorry.<br />What a dissapointment...
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Since those highly charged Weld days (how I love 'em) I have enjoyed the smooth, relaxed pace of Neil's recent albums. And with this album, Greendale, Neil Young has once again taken a new direction.  This is a wonderfull collection of songs that tell the story of the Green Family in Greendale.  The full story unfolds on the (included) DVD in both song and spoken word. The CD is a more polished rendering of the songs - less the spoken word. Neil proves once again that he is a master at building images from sound.
014028009X|3.0|Yes, it's funny. But there's only so much &quot;shagging&quot;, drinking, and obsessions about men a woman can take. I put it down after reading almost half of it. THere wasn't any real plot I could ascertain, and the constant shagging or crying into the wine bottle over lack thereof got real old real fast. But, if you can put up with the characters's silliness, I'm sure a plot emerged somewhere.  And there were funny parts.  But it just didn't keep me interested enough to read the whole thing.
B00000055E|3.0|Following the untimely and tragic death of musical genius and rap icon, Tupac Shakur, his mother, Afeni, saw to it that she and his estate attained the rights to his musical legacy including some of the lost and forgotten outtakes from his early albums like &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.&quot; and &quot;Thug Life&quot;. Such album leftovers seem to be the highlight of this beefed-up but dated double album.<br />Most of the tracks on this album were clearly recorded between 1992 and 1994, before his incarceration and his infamous days on Death Row Records. There are some very powerful tracks like &quot;Hellrazor&quot; and the moving &quot;Do 4 Love&quot; but spreading it out over two discs hurts the overall feel of it. Pac's questions of self-worth on &quot;Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto&quot; also do a good job of showcasing Shakur the poet but there is no need for two versions of the same song when one got the job done just fine. Aside from these highlights, most of this two-disc album sounds exactly the same. More work could have been done to update the beats and make the tracks stand out more on their own. All that really remains in the average listener's mind when he thinks of the majority of music on &quot;R U Still Down&quot; is the raspy and tired-sounding voice of Shakur echoing through the speakers. As much as many fans criticize later posthomous releases for depending too much on samples and R&amp;B-type production, a little of that might have actually helped this particular release. I'm not suggesting that the whole album sound that way but a few tracks could have stood to be polished a bit.<br />All in all, &quot;R U Still Down&quot; is a very raw and rugged-souding album. As much as I wanted to get into a lot of the tracks on this album, the production was just so simple that it made many of them sound exactly the same. For those who might not know, much of the production has been changed but the record still feels rushed. The finished result is a double-album that could have been cut down considerably but is still worth the price of admission for any true Pac fan.le-album that could have been cut down considerably but is still worth the price of admission for any true Pac fan.

B00000IO4J|3.0|Similiar in premise to Mark L. Lester's CLASS OF 1999 with an obvious ode to INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, screenwriter Kevin Williamson joins forces with director Robert Rodriguez for a fast-moving &quot;aliens take over our school&quot; popcorn flick. With a director known best for Mexican gun battle movies and a writer known for wise-cracking parodies of slasher flicks, a movie about aliens taking over high school classrooms would not seem like an obvious choice.<br />A group of high school students led by super-senior Hartnett (in his debut role) are shocked to discover that their teachers are actually alien invaders. It's up to dweeby Elijah Wood, snobby Jordana Brewster, and a handful of jocks and outcasts to stop them. As it turns out, the beings that live inside their hosts have a fatal reaction to the ingredients in the class drug dealer's stash. Using the contraband as their weapon, the group heads to the high school where the teachers are ready and waiting.<br />While it does provide some tense moments, this movie seems to play it safe a little too often. Rather than sacrifice its more popular characters, it always seems to stick them in escapable situations and pander to what the audience would like to see happen with them. The kids, who are on a &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; tip very rarely seem to be in any authentic danger. This seems more like a kiddie-version of Heinlan's &quot;Puppet Masters&quot; than a real serious sci-fi thriller. For all its faults, at the very least, this film has fun with its cast which includes Robert Patrick, Jon Stewart, Famke Jannsen, Usher Raymond, Duane Martin, and a dressed-down Salma Hayek. Hartnett, in particular, has very rarely been as good. Williamson's always-overwritten characters aren't quite as obnoxious as they were in his &quot;Scream&quot; scripts though subsquently, Rodriguez's style feels just a little toned down. What many had assumed to be his trademark Mexican stand-off style mentality of directing is not quite the case here. He's moving in a different direction and while I am a fan of his other style, it is good to see him try something different. The collaborative efforts of both seem to combine for an entertaining if somewhat predictable and harmless new take on an old story.s not quite the case here.

B00000583F|5.0|I loved it when it first came out, and I still love it. Yes, its very &quot;Sabbath&quot;, but also goes far beyond that. They are the best psychadelic rock band I have ever seen play, and this record is almost as good as their shows. <BR>It's way more subtle and low-key than Sabbath or Kyuss, real underground stuff. <BR>Dirty and deep. <BR>Spiritual music.<BR>I also like their other few releases, but this album is their best. Neverthelss I absolutely understand that many will disagree and not enjoy this record. It's too underground to be appreciated by a majority of consumers. But give it a shot, if you like it, you'll probably REALLY like it.
B000059TEQ|5.0|The acting is weak? Maybe, but the relationship is realistic, romantic, &amp; the film works. Why does it work? Because the central relationship has true chemistry &amp; is unsentimental--it's the tragedy of the unsentimental relationship being cut short by fate that makes the film itself a sentimental tearjerker. McGraw isn't Ellen Burstyn &amp; O'Neil isn't Robert Mitchum but what matters is that this is a story of a relationship that has chemistry, a real one, whether or not you believe O'Neil goes to Harvard, etc. For the best satirical remake of this film in a more raunchy Euopean style check out the Dutch film &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; by Paul (Basic Instict/Robocop/StarshipTroppers) Verhoeven. And by the way, &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; was also a huge hit.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|what an amazing album,  He has guts to put out something like this.  you never know what to expect from neil young.  His best work since sleeps with angels.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I read reviews of Neil Youngs new album that went from the abysmal to quite good.I didnt know weither to shell out for one of his reissues or buy this. Having gone for Greendale I have to say this is a sleeper which will grow on you with more listens.Get the DVD version for an extra couple of bucks with the concert from Dublin where he performs the material acoustically with narrative in between.There are some standouts like Bandit and Carmichael but the overall feel is more Tonights the Night and Zuma.Why critics are bringing up Trans and comparing Greendale to that are beyond me.Screw'em anyway - this is a solid offering which can be quite strange sometimes but thats why we like Neil anyhow,Right?
B00005N5S5|5.0|Before Titanic...<br />Before True Lies....<br />Before Aliens....there was The Terminator.<br />James Cameron's first bona fide hit, this 1984 science fiction/action thriller revived the action movie genre and provided Arnold Schwarzenegger with not only an iconic movie role but a chance to prove that he had an actor's mind as well as a bodybuilder's physique.  It not only showed that Ahhnold could handle a more challenging role than Conan the Barbarian, but that he was quite capable of taking career risks.<br />Now that he is running for the governorship of California (and starred in many other films, including two sequels to The Terminator), it seems odd to think that Schwarzenegger was gambling his credibility (and his box office appeal) to take the role of the villain.  After all, who better than this physically imposing fellow to portray the relentless cyborg sent from the future to rid the world of the woman who is destined to be the mother of humanity's future deliverer?<br />1984's The Terminator paints a dark vision of a machine-dominated world where hunter-killer robots and Terminators are waging a war of extinction against humanity.  By 2029 A.D., however, the machines are on the verge of defeat at the hands of John Connor and his valiant troops.  In a last ditch attempt to win, the Skynet computers send a single Cyberdine T-101 unit (Schwarzenegger) back to 1984 Los Angeles to dispose of John Connor's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton).<br />Before the time portal breaks down forever (or at least until T2), Connor manages to send Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back to 1984 to protect his mother-to-be.  Although he is weakened by the time jump and definitely more vulnerable than his cyborg nemesis, he has an advantage that the Terminator and its masters don't; he knows what Sarah Connor looks like.  This proves to be fatal for at least two other Sarah Connors in the L.A. phone book, as well as for Sarah's roommate and her boyfriend.  The Terminator, only knowing the name Sarah Connors, dispatches these unlucky victims while Reese manages to reach the true target in the nick of time.<br />The Terminator is well-written and, although its plot is not as mind bending as Schwarzenegger's later hit Total Recall, never insults the audience's intelligence.  The pace of the movie is, like the villain, full of purpose and relentless.  Critics and Ahhnold bashers might scoff at Schwarzenegger's android-like mannerisms, but his very expressionless glare and the way his head swivels to follow his eyes bring the cold efficiency of a shark to mind.  (And if you were wondering, this was the first movie where Ahhnold utters his now famous phrase \\"I'll be back.\\")<br /> Brad Fiedel's effective musical score, Stan Winston's amazing make-up effects, and Cameron's directing helped make The Terminator a classic of the action/science fiction genre.<br />The MGM Special Edition DVD presents the movie in a digitally mastered, hi-definition transfer widescreen version with both its original mono sound track and a new 5.1 Stereo Remix.  It also includes audio tracks in French and Spanish, subtitles in English, French and Spanish, and for viewers with DVD-ROM drives on their home computers, script-to-screen features.  The extra features (such as deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, and trailers and TV spots) are on the other side of this double-sided disc.e name Sarah Connors, dispatches these unlucky victims while Reese manages to reach the true target in the nick of time.<br />The Terminator is well-written and, although its plot is not as mind bending as Schwarzenegger's later hit Total Recall, never insults the audience's intelligence.

B000002H70|5.0|I listened to this album (actual vinyl; not CD) the other day for the first time in ages, and was amazed to find that it was still as powerful and affecting as it was 12 years ago. Prior to this album coming out, my Cure collection consisted of Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me and a tape of Staring at the Sea, but neither prepared me for Disintegration. The songs played on the radio at the time, &quot;Fascination Street&quot; and &quot;Lovesong&quot;, while great songs, also do not accurately represent the theme of this album. This album is primarily made up of epic length pop soundpieces including: &quot;Pictures of You&quot;, &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot;, &quot;Plainsong&quot;, &quot;Same Deep Water as You&quot;, &quot;Untitled&quot;, and the masterpiece, &quot;Disintegration&quot;. These pieces all consist of lengthy instumental sections which use deceptively simple intertwining melodies and rhythms, which while repetitive, create an atmosphere which somehow leads to contemplation and retrospection. I don't know how else to put it. For some reason, Smashing Pumpkins Adore album has the same effect. I can't recommend Disintegration enough!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|In order for a song to be included on this cd,it had to be released as a single either in England or America,AND it had to go all the way to the top of the charts. All these songs acomplished that feat,thats why there included here,it's not that complicated to understand... See,simple.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is the greatest movie I've seen all year and i work at a movie theater so I've seen a lot of them. It was funny and had some things for everybody, not just kids. I recommend this movie to everyone!
B00005KARK|5.0|Ok I grew up with this movie, meaning I can't remember a time when I did NOT know this movie. The people who talk about racism, I had to stop and read to even know what they were talking about!<br />For one thing, the song Roustabouts? The people were all black? I for one couldn't tell, it was nighttime and everything was dark! I never thought they were all black. And the lyrics in the song are racist and demeaning? I don't know about you but to this day I can barely tell what they're saying! The lyrics always seemed quite garbled and unintelligible to me. I always just thought it was a cool-sounding song that went along to the beat of them hammering in the tent stakes. I hardly think any child is going to hear this song and pick up a racist attitude. I certainly didn't, and I was not an unintelligent child. <br />And as for the crows, I NEVER connected them with black people when I was a child. They were CROWS. I remember thinking that they were musicians, but I never stared at the screen and thought, \\"Oh, those crows are supposed to be like black people! Black people all smoke cigars and wear striped shirts!\\" I think people are reading too far into it and assuming too much about the connections their children will make. Children will not view cartoons with a racist attitude, especially if it is animals and not people that are being depicted.<br />Dumbo has some wonderful lessons in it. The film is certainly not PRO animal cruelty, it is most obviously against it. Children viewing it will learn to treat animals kindly because it shows them with feelings and emotions. Poor little Dumbo crying after his mother is taken away never fails to choke me up. The scenes of Dumbo's mother being whipped and locked up are heart-wrenching, but I think children need to be exposed to things like that. Life is hard and without a concept of how difficult life can be, how will they ever grow up with any sense of reality? <br />The sequence where Timothy brings Dumbo to visit his mother in her cage is so touching, I cannot watch it without getting tears in my eyes, and movies rarely make me cry. Just thinking about it makes me misty. It would make anyone appreciate having a loving mother. <br />Dumbo is a great movie for children, it is loaded with morals and important life lessons and I can't imagine why anyone would not want to let their child view it.
B0000524CY|3.0|The Exorcist is a pretty good movie.  But it is not horror!  Everone says &quot;The Exorcist is the Scariest movie of all time,&quot; or &quot;Don't Watch the Exorcist Alone!&quot;  Well I wrote this review to prove them wrong.  The Exorcist is very good movie...but it was made to be scary, and it's nothing of the sort.  I would've given this film 5 stars, but i didn't because i was expecting horror.  What I got was a beautiful, masterful film of pure genius.  If I was looking forward to that kind of film, you wouldn't be reading a negative review; it would be positive.  Great acting, cinematography, special effects, and storyline make this a disturbing, desciptive movie on the demonic takeover on a child's life...but if you want to see REAL horror...see the films below:<br />Texas Chainsaw Massacre<BR>Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2<BR>Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3: Leatherface<BR>A Nightmare on Elm Street<BR>Jason<BR>A Blair Witch Project<BR>The Shining<BR>Halloween 1<BR>Halloween 2<BR>Halloween 3<BR>Halloween 4<BR>Halloween 5 <BR>Halloween: H2o<BR>Halloween: Ressurection<BR>Silence of the Lambs<BR>Hannibal<BR>28 Days Later<BR>Psyco<BR>Jeepers Creepers <BR>Omen<BR>Night of the Living Dead<BR>Don't Look Now
0385504209|1.0|In addition to the Eighth-grade reading level, painfully contrived dialogue, and insipid characters, this book is rife with historical error.  For example, the Knights Templar were not destroyed by the church, but by the King of France, and the Dead Sea Scrolls DO NOT discuss Jesus' alleged marriage.  What is really disturbing is Brown's claim to have extensively researched this book.  A claim which may lead many less-educated readers to believe this is a very factual and historically accurate novel.  There are so many outrageous claims-I would love to see some footnotes and references!<br />  Furthermore, Brown's implication that the Christian/Catholic church destroyed the sacred feminine in order to maintain a powerful patriarchal society just doesn't hold water.  Never mind that the pagan societies so revered by Brown for their inclusion of goddess worship were explicitly patriarchal and oppressive of women (name any FEMALE Roman senator, empress, Athenian leader, Persian leader, etc.).  And what about the Cult of the Virgin Mary?  The writings of St. Bernard hardly demonstrate oppression of the sacred feminine!<br />  Unfortunately, I sense that any challenge to Brown's research would be met with a snide 'Michael Moore' defense-&quot;It's JUST fiction.&quot;<br />  A far superior read is Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum.  It is well-written, erudite, humorous, and devoid of Brown's juvenile moral equations(liberal=Good, conservative=Bad) and shoddy history.
0671027387|3.0|Like other readers, I was disappointed after the quality of both the DaVinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons.  This book seemed forced into the Dan Brown formula: ridiculously capable people drawn into dangerous, dark situations (shades of Hitchcock) masterminded by a secretive evil genius whose identity is revealed just at the end (the evil genius seems always to be a major character, friendly with and intellectually sympathetic to the cause of the protagonist)and violent hijinx ensue.  Good does win out and the book ends when the protagonist gets into the sack with whoever he/she has been thrown together with by trials and tribulations engineered by EG referred to above.  All of this sprinkled with liberal doses of real fun, eyepopping mind-bending technology/history.  None of this is terrible (in fact, Michael Crichton has made a fortune by hewing to his similar code), but after 3 books it gets a little dreary.  The good news is that Dan Brown evidently appreciates that, and so the more recent books are better: more clever, and more reliant on ambiguous evidence rather than easily debunked factual assertions.  Reading it is still more entertaining than watching TV.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Based on historical events, this film captures the trials and tribulations of three half-caste girls who fight against Australia's attempt of racial purification. During the 1931 Western Australia Aborigines Act all half-caste children are forcibly removed from their families to be reformed and educated in order to be re-entered into society as servants and caretakers for white families. Shortly after being abducted Molly and her two younger sisters escape and follow the rabbit-proof fence north to be reunited with their mother. This film mostly follows their 1500+ trek through the harsh Australian territory while being actively hunted. RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is a beautiful film that successfully captures the emotional and physical aspects of this story. The cinematography and music were brilliant and lends an additional element to the film. The documentary on the selection of the three children to act in the film is also very informative and entertaining. RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is a film well-worth viewing. Unfortunately this is only one small chapter in Australia's prevalent history of controlling the races.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|A great film and the DVD is loaded with extras. Suitable for ages two and up. <br />This is a film most adults will also enjoy.
B00009RDG8|5.0|These reviews for the most part are laughable. In keeping perspecttive that this is a movie (although a very good one), there is a rich subtext, as well as providing deeper insight within the Special Forces Communities and the Operatives who comprise them than any other movie I've seen, including many of the actually realistic Special Warfare tactics and Survival and Stealth techniques which make them The Elite, especially escape and evasion authenticated by the World Reknowned Master Tracker and Military Elite Trainer, Tom Brown. In fact, much of this film is based on an actual experience where Tom Brown was the only one who could track a commando gone rogue, however the circumstances were very different and coincidental. Close enough to have him on as Technical Advisor though.<br />Yes, the movie is somewhat ambiguous as to motives, who's who, and what's what, but that's much of the additional appeal of the movie (aside from the way our Special Operative character uses his skills to survive overwelming odds time and time again by any means necessary) for example,<br />Yes, he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.<BR>No, he did'nt \\"just flip out\\"... he was set up in a later op by \\"Dale\\" which kicked his PTSD into overdrive.<BR>Yes, the \\"Hunters\\" he kills in Oregon were Special Forces \\"sweepers\\". As a secret operative who \\"does'nt exist\\" and \\"off the range\\", you're then considered a risk to National Security and are to be neutralized to maintain the secrecy of these very real groups and ops/operatives. <BR>No, he did'nt enjoy killing people who kill animals... If you see the film, he uses a mixed metaphorical analogy about the food chain... what if humans were no longer on top, and we were slaughtered wholesale like chickens... Essentially, he meant this as those in power including the military abuse their authorities over \\"ordinary\\" people. That was what he was fighting. Treating their bodies as game in the film was'nt necessary IMO, but it emphasized his point.<BR>Yes, sadly he was unable to \\"turn off\\" his deeply engrained kill reflexes, but that's how you're conditioned... kill or be killed, no exceptions. He only killed those who posed a genuine mortal threat to him, or stood to hinder his own survival. Ultimately, it becomes clear it was'nt his fault... he fought it, reached out for help, and was exploited. The NORMAL human psyche can only withstand so much horror. It's those who are'nt affected who are the ones to worry most about.<br />In any case, The Hunted, for the average viewer provides plenty of gratuitous gun and knife violence, brutality, \\"cool camoflauge tricks\\", car chases, rambo traps... Which is all good for commercial value and empty brain movie goers, but there's \\"Far More Than Meets The Eye\\" with The Hunted. Watch it and find out what YOU really see... BTW... Great interviews with Benecio Del Toro, Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Brown, and a couple Special Forces knife fighting trainers.
0345457684|5.0|As a ravenous scifi reader, I love finding new authors to explore. This is especially true of authors like Richard K. Morgan, who bring a lot of new ideas out in their work.  The tech in this book is great and points to some interesting possibilities for future books based on the same world view. State of the art gene tailored tech ninjas, back alley body mods, AI controlled hotels with overactive self defense systems, telepathic advertising, virtual snuff. This was a fun read.<br />The fact that Mr. Morgan only has one release is going to give me a nervous breakdown.

0385507755|4.0|James Frey was a tortured drug/alcohol addict, and his autobiography was a grueling manual on the forays of living a self-induced purgatory on Earth.  After reading about Frey's abuse of crack, alcohol, glue and every other possible inhalant, I experienced the author's torture first hand, and I was stirred accordingly.  At one point in his recovery plan, Frey was forced to write a comprehensive account of his sins (in addition to those involving substance abuse).  Frey's account of misdoings was full of hatred, evil and cruelty.  Frey was not a likable guy.  Ironically, Frey was of the opinion that all blame for his descent into Hades rested solely on his shoulders.  Frey refused to blame his environment, his parents, biological influences or heredity.  Far be it for Frey to name genetic anomalies for his abusive drug induced life.  However, during one therapy session, it was revealed that Frey suffered from a horribly painful ear infection during infancy that went untreated/undetected until he was a youth.  The parents recognized their son's constant crying as abnormal, but had no way of knowing that it was a cry of physical pain.  Perhaps infant Frey developed hatred towards his parents and used drugs to lash out at them because of a subconscious memory of his constant untreated physical agony.  Nevertheless, even faced with this possibility, Frey refused to blame his parents and their inability to alleviate the ear pain.<br />When the book began, Frey awoke from a stupor on an airplane.  He was a physical mess, and he had missing teeth and a hole in his cheek.  His clothes were covered with spit, urine, vomit and blood.  Frey's despondent parents were finally able to get their tortured son into rehab.  Almost all of Frey's account occurred inside the rehab center.  Frey met many intriguing damaged individuals (an ex champion boxer, a judge, a university professor, etc.) inside the unit, and his account of their stories was mesmerizing to read.  Frey also met a troubled drug-addicted whore in rehab and fell deeply in love with her.  All of these stories, along with Frey's own personal elucidation, made for an incredible read.  Sadly, Frey remained unconvinced that the AAA 12-steps program or God had anything to do with his sobriety before, during or after rehab.  Frey was convinced that the changes that converted him from a near dead zombie to a chain-smoking, married, drug-free, relatively valuable member of society were totally self-induced.  Frey simply made the choice to stop abusing and that was enough to make it so.  Sure Frey!<br />Jay's Grade<BR>A-
B00005NTN5|5.0|This movie blew my socks off. It is a stunning Film Noir in which a female ex-con and a mob whore fall in love and plot to steal 2 million bucks from the mob. The dialogue is intelligent and edgy, the sex is steamy, and unless you're a homophobe, the story has a heart. The actors realize their roles to perfection, and Jenifer Tilly's performance rated an Oscar in my opinion. As the mob whore, her seduction of Gina Gershon as Corky, the ex-con, took my breath away. You'll want to watch it over and over. Beg, borrow or steal this DVD, it's a must see.
B000092T6M|2.0|I am a disappointed with this release. It seems to boasts so much about a picture transfer and new DTS sound. The picture quality remains poor and the sound nothing more than just normal 5.1 sound. As regards the wonderful documentary about Robin Hood the extras are unnecessary and irrelevant. The so called \\"vintage\\" interviews should not be added. It seems that the producers have dug up all they have and just filled up the DVD just as an excuse to cash in on a few bucks. The extended scenes were clearly taken out in the original movie to add pacing to the movie. Hence the added scene slowed the picture down. The movie on the other hand is fantastic. Brilliantly directed! Alan Rickman is ALAN RICKMAN. There is no one who can play a villain you love to hate. The man is \\"vintage\\"...what the producers called \\"vintage\\" is but to me [fluff]. Now Alan is VINTAGE......
B000088E6D|5.0|I first discoverd Mr. Buble on the NBC Today Show in the christmas 2002 season.  I was hooked! I absoutly love this man. His voice is out of this world it gives me chills.  Even my 7 year old loves him. We dance to his music all the time, My Favorite song is  \\"SWAY\\"..  For anybody that is thinking about buying this CD, go for it it will be the best [money maount]you will ever spend.
B000089RVX|5.0|Well, I must say that I am usually pretty disgusted with the crap that most artists put out for sale on their albums.  Tired of buying a CD because of the 1 or 2 good tracks you hear on the radio, or on a STDK only to find that those are the ONLY 1 or two decent songs on the whole album.<br />Well, this album (thankfully) breaks that cycle.  The entire album (11 tracks) is good.  You can drop the disk in and listen to the whole thing without having to skip past the bad tracks.  There really are no bad tracks.<br />If you like the \\"feel\\" of the songs you might have already heard from this album then you will probably be very pleased with the entire thing.<br />Lee's voice is beautiful and really serves to sooth the Metal/Goth instrumentals.  I am looking forward to their next album.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I find that Radiohead has indeed broken the mold for rock music--they've successfully incorporated foreign elements that are usually unassociated with their genre, and yet managed to maintain their unique, sophisticated sound.  For instance, in a song from KIDA 'The National Anthem' there was an influence of free form jazz, used primarily to convey a chaotic sound.  Although it may have been thoroughly orchestrated before hand, it seems that it's almost an acknowledgement or tribute to other kinds of musical enterprises.<BR>The reflection I get from listening to Hail To The Thief in comparison to their earlier albums is that they've evolved over time.  It is true, however, that it sounds nothing like OK Computer, and holds few of the original ballets that made them famous in the first place.  I suppose it's just a difference in opinion.<BR>Radiohead is a different sort of band in that it has been able to change, to rebel even against their own comfort zone that earned them the most money.  I think that the most intellectual and advanced musicians have come where they are because they have forced themselves to change, to overcome the standard sound.<BR>For a completely unrelated example, Miles Davis was unable to play with true accuracy with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker in the Bee Bop era...so instead of limiting himself, he and other musicians aspired to create a new sort of sound that identifies jazz today.  He was a key player in The Birth of the Cool, and it truly was a birth.  Roland Kirk is another example of someone who has changed music because he refused to be limited.  He was a blind man who played several instruments at once, which of course sounded ludicrous at the time.  However, he was able to create the most beautiful ballads, and the most fervent movements by trying something that wasn't originally accepted.<BR>I'm not necessarily comparing Radiohead with Miles Davis or Roland Kirk, mainly because they are so different.  But I'm just stressing the importance of change in music, no matter what type it is.
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard Maroon 5 on the radio. They played harder to breathe, their first single. They caught my attention, I liked their sound.  Then I saw they had a HUGE celebrity fan base when MTV news had a quick special on this upcoming new band named Maroon 5 and how they were becoming rapidly popular in Hollywood. John Mayer is one of their main supporters.  So I thought hmmmm....I then sampled some of their songs and decided i have to hear their whole CD. WELL WORTH THE 13 BUCKS!!! The whole CD is great!! I really like em and all of my friends have heard me blaring their CD and are now Maroon 5 fans as well, even though at the start I had a hard time trying to explain to them what type of music they classified under. Best I could come up with was Dave Matthews Band meets John Mayer.  If your thinking of buying their cd BUY IT, trust me you wont regret it.  I rarely find a CD that I can just press play and sit throught the whole CD. Usually bands have a hit single and maybe one or two other good ones on their album. Not Maroon 5 the entire CD is full of awesome music. They have a unique sound that I cant get enough of. I highly recommend Secret and Sunday Morning. Give it a listen you wont regret it.

B000003TAB|5.0|There are very few compilation CD's that are actually good. This is one of them. Nirvana's Incesticide is packed with 15 songs guaranteed to rock you no matter what. &quot;Dive&quot;, &quot;Sliver&quot;, &quot;Son of a gun&quot;, &quot;Hairspray Queen&quot;, &quot;Aero Zeppelin&quot;, and &quot;Aneurysm&quot; are my favorite songs on here. This is essential for any Nirvana fan's collection.<br />My only complaints are: why is &quot;Downer&quot; on here? You can already find that on the Bleach album. Also, I didn't like &quot;Big Long Now&quot; because it seemed to drag a little, but those are just minor complaints .<br />NOTE: Pick up Kurt Cobain's Journals to find the lyrics to some of these songs.
0694013889|1.0|We were anxious to get all sorts of potty training books for my daughter and this was well known so we got it.  I cannot express how much I dislike this book.  The only way I can get through it is to read it in an English Accent to amuse myself.  My daughter likes it ok but I just can't stand it.  I have hidden it from her so I never have to read it again.  The language is not accurate (wee wee and poo poo), repetitive (not in a good way) and the pictures don't accurately portray current potty seats at all.  Run don't walk to find other books!
B00009P1O5|5.0|Re-ac-tor has been much maligned, but this newly remastered CD shows that the criticism is unfounded.  My favorite track is \\"Shots\\", which is arguably the most incendiary song in the Neil Young catalog.  This shows two sides of Neil - the beautiful melodies and heart-racing riffs.      The lyrics are obscure, even for Neil.  But so what?  Greendale has good lyrics, but I find the music to be tedious.  I'll take good tunes with rousing choruses (like \\"Southern Pacific\\") over anything new he's released in the last five years.
0393057658|5.0|Any organization that is dedicated to preserving the idea of baseball as a mythic game and flourishes on celebrating its' tradition will attack \\"Moneyball\\" like Michael Moore does Bush. \\"Moneyball\\" is the kind of book that will have thoughtful baseball fans wondering two things: 1. Is it really this simple to find undervalued guys based on one or two traditionally overlooked stats? 2. When will people stop criticizing the Oakland GM Billy Beane for things like his arrogance and aggresivness and actually look at what that has accomplished?<br />In this age of players holding out for huge contracts before they've even played one inning, Beane is a great anecdote, refusing to draft players that have all the right aesthetics, baseball-related or otherwise. It's very funny, in a sad way, that Billy Beane seems to be the only baseball guy who actaully looks at what a player has accomplished so far. Everyone else, he correctly claims, looks at what a guy MIGHT become, as opposed to what he has done. Why take a high school golden boy who statistics say has an overwhelmingly low chance of high major league success and has spent his last 2 years mowing down skinny future engineering majors named Scooter over a proven college player who has posted good numbers against much stiffer competition and has much more experience? When I was in high school, everyone was drooling over our shortstop who could hit the ball a mile and run like the wind, but could do nothing in between. At the same time I knew a guy that played for a local college that routinely posted great numbers and had great showings agasint other guys being scouted, but he didn't fit the traditional baseball paradigm and was therefore forgotten about and I always wondered why. This book finally gave me my answer. This is exactly Beane's strategy, to find guys who fit the stats that he thinks are important and let the numbers and odds dictate the rest. <br />Something should be said too about not just the content of this book, but the way it is written. The most interesting story is, bar none, the story of Beane's own personal failure as a can't miss prospect. Everyone else who speaks of players talk fondly of a player who reminds them of themselves in their glory years, but Beane picks people who are the exact opposite of what he was, a high school golden boy who had all the potential in the world, but had not accomplished much stat-wise. There is even a story in the book in which Beane talks with a scout who once scouted him and loved him, despite admitting he never looked at a single stat of his. <br />The way this book punches a hole through not only traditional baseball and strategy but the real psychological makeup of those who run it is nothing short of amazing. You'll be fascinated by every single story in the book, even though they are all about guys who you probably never heard of and might not for years. And that's exactly Billy Beane's idea of a great #1 draft pick.
B00000JLWW|4.0|Personally, &quot;Titanic&quot; is my favorite movie.  Yes, I was a hopeless romantic 18 year old when it came out and I admit to seeing it in the theater 6 times (I kept going back with friends who hadn't seen it yet) but, aside from that, the movie is well-written, well-acted and incredibly filmed.  I appreciate James Cameron's dedication to detail and that the sinking sequence in the movie is almost in real time.  I think that if you are not affected in some way by this movie, then you didn't really watch it.  <br />I bought the movie when it first came out on tape and only upgraded to the DVD because I received it as a Christmas present the same year I received a DVD player.  Right now, the only thing the DVD has going for it is the fact that you don't need to change discs in the middle of the movie like you do with the tapes.  Special features are non-existent on this DVD, which is a real shame when one considers all the scenes that were filmed and cut from the final film.  There are probably about an hour of cut scenes locked away in a vault somewhere, which saddens me greatly.  Add to that all the historical information that could have been included and this could have been an outstanding DVD experience.  This is why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  I'll keep my fingers crossed that someday a special edition DVD will be released, but until then, don't rush out to buy this one.
0156027321|5.0|A wonderful read.  It's been a month since I finished and still think about this book from time to time.  Excellent writing and story telling.
0385504209|2.0|This very popular book uses alternative ideas of the history of Christianity as the basis for the plot.  The author has taken a large number of crackpot ideas about the history of Christianity and European history in general and stitched them together to produce a conventional thriller.  In general, all these ideas center around the common theme of a hidden or secret history of Christianity suppressed by the Church.  The plot elements are cleverly integrated using a series of puzzles.  The overall story is cast as a kind of Grail legend with virtuous knight (a la Parsifal) and an evil sorcerer type (a la Klingsor).  The quality of writing, however, is poor.  The characters are schematic and exist only as devices to move from one gimmick to another.  The action of the plot per se is rather silly.  Not recommended, even for light reading.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I'm a longtime Neil fan, and I was really interested in seeing what &quot;Greendale&quot; was going to be like. I missed the chance to see him do it live earlier this year (and man, I regret it now), so I picked this album up the day it went on sale. I've had the chance to give it a couple of spins now - and it is a great album. Neil always plays his best with the Horse, and they sound tighter than ever on this disc - vintage Neil sound, heavy on the guitars, but with that driving bass and drums. The songs?<br />Well, if you hadn't heard, &quot;Greendale&quot; is a concept album (to use the over-worked phrase) - it's a fictional town (amazingly well-realized, especially once you check out neilyoung.com), and the story focuses on the Green family. Neil said that he started writing and out came these characters and this story - the catalyst to the events is the shooting of a cop by young Jed Green. <br />The story is related in a more-or-less chronological way, with the first couple of songs introducing us to the characters before getting into the heart of things. &quot;Leave the Driving&quot;, the song that tells the story of Jed shooting the cop is my early favourite, with Neil wailing on the harmonica and telling us how this tragic event happened. &quot;Grandpa's Interview&quot; is another stand-out - in fact, I don't think there's a weak track on this album. The sound ranges from straight-ahead rock to rollicking blues to mournful, slow-burning guitar work, but it's all unmistakably Neil (and the Horse).<br />Is this album for everyone? Definitely not - there's not a radio-friendly track here, and you have to get into the story to truly enjoy the songs, this is not background music. It challenges you, makes you think, but that's what I love about Neil. He's never been afraid to make the music he wants - usually it works, occasionally it doesn't (I still don't own the Shocking Pinks album, and never will), but you have to respect the fact that 30-something years after recording &quot;Down to the Wire&quot;, Neil's still turning out great music instead of sitting on his past glories (are you listening Pete Townsend and Roger Daltry?).<br />The scoop - if you're a Neil fan, you owe it to yourself to check this album out. If you're not, you just may become one.

0783225857|4.0|Mockingbird killing revisited<br /> <br /> <br />Some classic movies remain relevant long after the era they portrayed passed into memory.  Some should be left untouched.  Except for the acting of Gregory Peck and Brock Peters, the movie version of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird seems like a slow moving story going at 33 rpm in a world that's on warp speed 40 years after the movies release.<br /> <br />The movie set in Black and White cinematography moves slowly with its plot introducing all the characters especially the children in little vignettes.  Yet for a movie about the mistreatment of African-Americans in the 1930's rural south, there is little exposition about the key figure, Tom Robinson, the man accused of rape by a spinster white women or the lives Blacks lived in that era.  <br /> <br />The movie glorified the courage of Atticus Finch, played stoically by Peck, who took to the unsuccessful defense of Robinson, who dies off-screen, much as the activities of the blacks in this movie are used to highlight Finch's lack of prejudice.  Where the Whites in the movie are portrayed in shades of gray from unrelenting bigotry to middling tolerance,  all the black characters are presented as noble savages with great dignity and idol-like appreciation for the attorney's defense.  40 years ago there was a lump in my throat, when the Black community seated in the balcony of the courthouse, stood silently to honour attorney Finch, now there was a look to my watch to see when this tale would come to an end.<br /> <br />Some parts of this drama still work, the attack on Finch's children by the wronged spinster's father and defense by recluse Boo Radley played by Robert Duvall, still works well as well as the sheriff's(played by Frank Overton) failure to prosecute Radley.  However, even that ending is marred by the reverential liberalism that the racists death cancels out Tom Robinson's.  But every black character even the Finch maid and nanny, Calpurnia, is shown with respect and anonymity.  Its as if the movie's creative team were afraid to show three dimensional African American life, proving once again in the words of Nat \\"King\\" Cole, \\"Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark.\\"<br /> <br /> <br />                                                                        Joseph B.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Whoever says that this album is not that great ... knows nothing about music. Radiohead is brilliant, and far from overrated. They are one of the few good bands these days that are still around and still make good music. But if experimental rock isn't for you, be fore-warned, this contains large amount of it. So if the sound of good, talentful music makes you vomit, dont listen to this album, go buy something like System of A Down and continue listening to your corporate, bland, and overplayed nu-metal.
B00005MKA3|5.0|This is, hands down, Bob Marley's best CD. There is not a bad song on the entire thing. &quot;Babylon System&quot; and &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; are absolute works of art, but the whole thing is unbelieveable. This CD confirmed my belief, and I say this in all seriousness, that Bob Marley was a prophet from God.
6305180261|5.0|This is simply one of the best rock n roll videos ever.  It's just Guns n Roses music videos, but it absolutely rocks.

Hopefully there will be a part two!
630469797X|3.0|George Romero has been given credit for inventing zombies. For the record, there were zombie movies before Romero came along. Now moving along. A very original movie, and original concept. I am sure most of you already know it is about a group of people trapped in a mall while a world of zombies wonders around outside, eventually making their way inside the mall. I think the acting is high schoolish, as was the acting in the follow up &quot;Day Of The Dead&quot;. Some of the zombie make up looks  like amateurs dressing up for Halloween. But I do agree this is a classic. I would not agree this is the greatest horror film ever made as been said by many reviewers. I still prefer &quot;Day Of The Dead&quot; over this film. Some people think Romero can do no wrong, and I like some of his work, but I simply do not believe the zombie concept  belongs to him, as so many people seem to think. I also wish everyone would stop comparing every &quot;walking dead&quot; film to Romero's work.

Just get this cd and listen to it all the way through--I won't have any of that skipping to the next track nonsense.
014028009X|3.0|After hearing so much about this book, I was excited to see what all the hoopla was about. As a huge fan of British chic-lit, Bridget Jones' Diary unfortunately just didn't do it for me.  At times I found the way in which it was written to be kind of hard to follow and understand.  The quality of writing that I was hoping for was just not there.  In my opinion, this book is not all that it is cracked up to be!  There are better beach books out there.
0385505833|5.0|The idea of skipping Christmas made for a clever plot indeed! The ensuing problems that Luther and Nora Krank face due to their unorthodox decision and how they deal with those problems are what made this book one of the most enjoyable reads I've had for a long time. The character of Luther is what makes the book - his words, thoughts and actions - all perfect for those of us who enjoy sarcasm at it's best. Who hasn't felt overwhelmed by all the unnecessary obligations that have somehow become part of the Christmas celebration - and to which we'd all like to have the courage to chuck at times? The book is in no way a mockery towards the celebration of Christmas, which would offend some people, including myself, but rather an extremely humorous look at how many things went seriously wrong from what appeared on the face of it, to be a brilliant idea. It's not often I find myself laughing out loud when reading a book. I will be buying this book as a gift this Christmas for many of my friends. If they don't enjoy it, then I would have to wonder if they've become too serious.
B0000069NM|5.0|This album really changed my life. I had been wallowing in a sea of musical mediocrity and then I heard this disc!  I had almost lost hope in music-kind.  The only way this album won't affect you is if you're deaf and have no soul whatsoever.  Otherwise, you're gonna be getting groovelicous.  Medeski, Martin, and Wood are a perfect match for John Scofield's soulful and almost crying guitar riffs, which you can tell he's holding back to the point of pain!  When he lets go, watch out!  He'll send a chill up your spine and then bathe you in funk!  What an absolute pleasure! - Carl Franklin

0783229011|5.0|Since my childhood days of watching episodes of Mister Ed, the talking horse. I often wondered how long it took to teach Mister Ed to just move his lips? The voice man stood in the wings and through his voice. Finally, this little gem came along. I never thought they could pull it off technically and visually adding voice and mouth movement to the animals. And the animals acted so well. Just as convincing as their human counterparts. 'Babe' was such a hit in 1995 that it was nominated in five categories and won one for the visual effects. A very worthy and well-deserved win. 'Babe' can be enjoyed by everyone young and old. I would recommended it as one of my top favorite children's film. As with some fate, Babe is saved from an unfortunate destiny, where all pigs must go. Babe and Farmer Hoggett paths cross at a country fair. Hoggett and Babe from that moment something passed between them. Hoggett guesses the weight of the little pig in a contest. Later that that week, Hoggett is notified as the winner. It's when Hoggett brings Babe to his new home, Babe meets a menagarie of farm animals that take a liking to their new addition to the Hoggett farm. Babe is adopted by Fly, an Australian border collie. Babe makes friends with a duck who thinks he's a rooster as cover from being a main course for Christmas dinner. Babe also makes friends with an ailing old ewe, Ma.<br /><br /> One day, Farmer Hoggett allows Babe to accompany him and the sheepdogs in the fields where the sheep grazed. There Fly teaches Babe the art of being a sheep-pig. But, Babe also learns another valuable lesson in tending sheep. It's a test if Babe is cutout to be a good sheep-pig. With Ma's help the sheep co-operate with Babe. To Farmer Hoggett's amazement in Babe's special gift he enters Babe in annual sheepherding trials. In due time, Babe is put through the practice and confronts wolves who kill one of the sheep. Farmer Hoggett thinking Babe killed one of the sheep. Does it mean the death sentence for poor Babe? But Fly comes to Babe's rescue and saves the day for Babe. There's the jealous, bad cat out to get Babe when she snidely tells Babe of the pig's true purpose. Babe thinking that the Boss would in time eat him, Babe goes to Fly and ask if it were true. When Fly tells Babe the truth, Babe runs away in the rainy night. Next day, Fly and Farmer Hoggett find Babe taken by the cold rain and Hoggett nursed him back to health. Then the big day come and Hoggett and Babe go to the trials with a little surprise for the judges. Can Babe the sheep-pig prove himself good and be the next sheepherding champ? Bet you know the answer already. I'd recommend Babe to anyone of all ages, especially to parents with small children. It's a darling, captivating tale with a lesson for all. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something, until you prove them wrong. There's another film about another talking pig, 'Gordy' you may like, too.ence for poor Babe?

B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil Young unleashes his immense talent once again.  The songs are original.  His insights into the characters, citizens of the fictional town, are deep.  Young, at times witty, at times sarcastic,  just tells it like it is.<br />The songs are in no rush to end.  You can enjoy their fullness and immerse yourself into  them.  The band, Crazy Horse is, as usual,  terrific.  <br />The music stays with me, the emotions linger.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Most of the songs fall in to the 8-12 minute range with a mid tempo beat and some tasty guitar. As a reference point, if you like &quot;Ragged Glory&quot;, this record is for you.

B00005JLYU|3.0|I never really cared for the original, after all it seemed to want to rip off \\"The Matrix\\" & \\"Mission Impossible II\\", however this one is much better, but once again borrows from other movies>>> \\"Raiders\\"& \\"Goldeneye\\" in the beginning to \\"Cape Fear\\" in the middle, In this one we learn that some rings that can identify those in the Witness Protection program are missing, & the Angels have to find out who is behind it, which in turn puts them on a journey of epidemic proportions, it is clear that Barrymore, Diaz, & Lucy Lui are having fun, but the action sequences seem a little far-fetched & idiotic, what saves this one is its ensemble that has Crispin Glover returning as the Thin Man, to John Cleese as Lui's dad, to Matt LeBlanc as her boyfriend & Luke Wilson as Diaz' boyfriend to Bernie Mac as Bosley replacing Bill Murray, to Robert Patrick(T2) as a F.B.I. agent to Robert Forester(Jackie Brown) as the Head of the F.B.I. to one aged Demi Moore as a former angel, not to say that Moore looks bad, but compared to \\"Indecent Proposal\\" 10 years ago, one can see a difference, there is even a cameo by original angel Jaclyn Smith which is nice & of course John Forthye as Charlie who's intercom gets blown away by Moore, boy, have we ever waited for that, to Bruce Willis in a one-minute cameo, this is for the most part a fun movie, but has way too many gags & crazy elements(dirt bike chase, anyone) & seems more interested in making a fashion statement than actual plot, especially when we learn that Barrymore is one of these Witness Protection program clients who has an unstable ex-boyfriend that tries to act like Colin Farrell would act if he had done it, to doing a cheesy DeNiro takeoff from \\"Cape Fear\\" which is funny at times, but not very original & somewhat annoying, he is definately no DeNiro, Barrymore, Diaz, & Lui do their best to keep you entertained, & it is a good popcorn flick, but after repeated viewings, you will realize how idiotic it all is, & then wonder if everyone was really trying to make a meaningful movie or having a Hollywood get-together party!!!

B000002LQR|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers spent most of the 1980s wallowing in inconsistency and relative obscurity (their only major hit was a cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground,\\" and their album output was decidedly inconsistent), but this album changed all that.  \\"BloodSugarSexMagik\\" is a very good album that embodies the sound and feel of the 1990s; in 20 years, people will still listen to it in order to discover the sound of Southern California circa 1991.  Furthermore, it boasts some excellent tunes and plenty of frenetic instrumentation.  The musical keystone is Flea's thicker-than-a-swamp bass playing, which drives each track with its sweltering energy and hypnotic grooves.  John Frusciante adds his chicken-scratch, Hendrix-inspired fretwork, blending metal, funk, and grunge into the mix and setting up an entertaining point-counterpoint interplay with Flea.  Chad Smith's drumming is both powerful and restrained, and Anthony Kiedis' voice is as strong as ever.  Classics pop up at every turn; the epic \\"Funky Monks\\" goes through several distinct phases of thick grooving, \\"If You Have To Ask\\" is one of Kiedis' best raps, the title track captures 1991's grungiest moments, \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" showcases the band's jamming (pun intended) power, and the ballad \\"Under The Bridge\\" remains perhaps the band's most poignant song.  Yet \\"BloodSugar\\" is more of a continuous work, never defined by a single song; each song blends seamlessly into the next, creating an epic funkathon.  There are several forgettable numbers (e.g., the one-minute cover of Robert Johnson's \\"They're Red Hot,\\" the bland \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\"), but overall this is a coherent and well-performed piece of art.
0312263120|2.0|I truly enjoyed the da Vinci Code  by Dan Brown and thought Digital Fortress would be as good.  I was disappointed, however, because of the lack of character development.  The main characters seemed remarkably similar to those in da Vinci Code without the same depth.  The plot is good, but not a page turner.  Lastly, the &quot;villians&quot; were &quot;lack luster.&quot;  It seems that Brown used more foul language and seediness to make up for real content and excitement.  I was so disappointed I didn't even finish the book.
B00005JLZN|5.0|Rather than reiterate whats already been said in other reviews about the story line, I would like to say that this is one of the better examples of acting I've seen this summer. Kevin Spacey is excellent in his role as a liberal, alcoholic college professor whose active libido involves him in unimaginable misfortunes. The supporting actors are all very well cast into their respective roles. The plot will maintain your interest throughout the movie and unlike many other dramas available today this one is not overacted to the point of stupidity.<br />Two plus hours of solid entertainment!
B00005JKC3|2.0|Maybe I should have known better than to have high expectations I did for The Hulk, but considering the cast involved and who's sitting in the director's chair perhaps my expectations were justified. But despite all the hype and the big names, this big screen mega budget adaptation of The Hulk is ultimately disappointing. Eric Bana, who gave us such memorable lead characterizations in Chopper and Black Hawk Down, just seems a bit out of place as Bruce Banner: the man struggling to supress the beast within. Jennifer Connelly, who gets more and more beautiful the older she gets, is a fine choice as Betty Ross, while Sam Elliot (who plays her father General Ross) overacts quite a bit and seems a bit out of place as well. Nick Nolte however, gives the best performance in the film as Bruce's psychotic father. Director Ang Lee's use of using split frame shots (like in comic books to fully illustrate scenes) is a nice idea, but it does get quite annoying. Everyone seems to automatically nitpick the special effects and the CGI creation of the Hulk, but the big green machine himself is superbly animated and designed; and in a few shots actually looks real. The action scenes themselves are superbly put together as well throughout the first three quarters of the film; up until the climax and finale of the film where the movie turns into an incoherent cartoon. For me, that is where the film really fell apart, with the final fight scene and climax plus predictable ending which naturally sets the stage for the Hulk to smash and bash his way towards a sequel. All in all, The Hulk is an ultimately disappointing mega budget miss that aimed high, but fell well below radar. Go watch X2: X-Men United again.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck has created better rap than rappers, better rock than rockers, better funk that funkers, and better folk than folkers. On Sea Change he continues the trend by creating the best country album of the past several years and probably the greatest overall album of 2002.  The reason why Beck succeeds on so many formats is his innate knowledge of music but also his ability to retain things memorable about his previous efforts.  Here he returns to the production of Nigel Godrich that made Mutations in a winner but also completely departs from the fun bombast of Midnite Vultures.  What we get is acoustic heartbreak songwriting brilliance with the added touch of beautiful swooping orchestrations.  Many bands have tried using elaborate string sections recently, so the production might not sound all that special when you are reading about it on paper.  But the power and precise location of the instrumentation sends Sea Change to peaks untouched by anybody.  Beck has extended his own musical abilities too; launching into a complete singer songwriter mode.  His voice is weary and depressed, a perfect match for the quite sad lyrics.  But Beck finds a way through his excellent melody writing to make sure Sea Change is never at a loss to compell.  The writing may be sad, but I still can be happy while listening to Sea Change due to its instant accessibility and long-term replay value.  It is so sincere but not a turn-off to both casual and bigger Beck fans.  Add to Godrich's production and Beck's skills the talented extras and you get an album that I see no reason not to call a masterpiece.

I was surprised that as good as it was I had not heard about it previous to my rental. The story of a professor that is accused of rape and then murder and put on death row is fascinating. The journalist that tries to prove his innocence before he is executed only has 72 hours so the suspense builds. I don't want to say more since I might give away to much. Suffice it to say if you like Spacey, dramas, suspense, or movies like Shawshank Redemption, you will enjoy it.

As you might imagine, the audience was really happy when Neil finally got onto the stage. And immediately, you remembered why you were sitting on your hands for the past hour - Neil Young and Crazy Horse rocking. Rocking hard. So hard, it was hard to reconcile that this was the same Neil Young with the sweetness to write &quot;Old Man&quot;, &quot;Helpless&quot;, &quot;Till the Morning Comes&quot; and a hundred others.<br />Then almost a decade passed. Although Neil rocked out, he hadn't done so with the same gusto. Maybe it's the Nouveau Bushe administration, but something prodded Neil to rock better than ever with Crazy Horse. That's right - better than ever. Better than Rust Never Sleeps. And how did it happen? Neil and the Horse played the entire Greendale record beginning to end - with visual aids.<br />What is Greendale? In short, it's a fictional town with exagerated real world problems. The story that weaves throughout the album involves a family living at the Double E ranch. While the family members are too numerous to mention - there are two stars: Grandpa, who uses a family crisis to speak out against the tyranny of a judgmental press preying on tragedy, and Sun, the young adult daughter who decides to become a vocal activist for people, and ultimately for the environment.<br />Is the story a bit silly? Sure. However, the songs are long, tell interesting stories, and rock. You don't even know how much they rock until you see Neil frenetically jumping from one pedal to another on his stompbox combo (though it's hard to hear the difference between each of the overdrive settings). Neil still plays the Bigsby Les. The band sounds a bit better than they have in twenty years. If this sounds exciting to you, buy the record.<br />By the way, the last track &quot;Be the Rain&quot; is almost as powerful a message-song as &quot;Keep on Rockin' in the Free World&quot;. If you bought the record for this alone, you would not be making a horrible choice. And get thee to a Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse show.track &quot;Be the Rain&quot; is almost as powerful a message-song as &quot;Keep on Rockin' in the Free World&quot;.

0452283760|5.0|Is another wonderful review really necessary? I had to think about that long and hard. I believe it is, but i'll keep it short. I don't believe in giving too much away in a review that will persuade a new reader one way or the other. I'll let the artist do that; although there are several reviews here that do, I will not. However, I couldn't keep myself from promoting somthing that has made such a wonderful impact in my life. Before reading this novel, I had many questions, and the world seemed very confusing to me. I've now found somthing that makes sense, completely, that doesn't beg more questions, or leave me with a feeling of an incomplete explanation. I believe it is universal for man to be curious and have so many questions. Ayn Rand has broken thru a barrier that no other Man/Woman has ever broke through before, and hence shown a world with light and clarity. Many owe much gratitude to her hard work and piercing drive that has created such a brillant masterpiece.<BR>I don't reccomend it, I believe it is a NECESSARY read for a mans' progress.
0684830515|5.0|Although the novel seems almost tame by today's standards, when this book (Hemingway's first novel) was released in 1926 it was a ground breaker and considered scandalous by many, including Hemingway's parents. <br />The center of the novel is Jake Barnes, a WWI veteran who has lost the use of a certain very personal appendage as a result of a war wound. Jake struggles with what the wound means to his life and with his love for Brett Ashley, a love that in his mind will have to remain forever unrequited because of his wound.<br />Alcohol is a major player in Jake and his friends' lives, and throughout the book he attempts to cover over the pain he is in with alcohol and traveling with his friends. Hemingway, without even informing the reader of the exact nature of the wound (I doubt he would have been able to be published had he described the exact nature of the wound), conveys both the true nature of the wound and the emotional pain that comes with it for Jake.<br />The novel is somewhat auto-biographical in that Hemingway suffered wounds to his legs in WWI and that most of the characters were based on actual people he knew. At the time of the book's release, there was some concern that he might be sued for libel, but nothing ever came of it. In fact, several of the real individuals upon whom the characters were based bragged for many years that they were basis for the characters.<br />A little trivia related to the book: Hemingway's parents were repulsed by the novel and made Ernest aware of it. This caused some turmoil in family relations and Ernest's pride was obviously wounded by their disgust with the book. <br />Years later, when Hemingway was hospitalized after a plane crash, a reporter kept insisting that Hemingway's story was more auto-biographical than originally thought. The reporter kept insisting that he believed Hemingway suffered the same wound as Jake (despite the fact that Hemingway had fathered several children by then). Tired of arguing with thereporter, Hemingway finally pulled back the sheets to show the reporter that he suffered no such wound.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I was told to watch this DVD by my daughters who were captivated by this documentary of muscial talents. I was not sure I would, could, relate to their &quot;tastes&quot; in musical and artist splender, until I watched the DVD of &quot;The Buena Vista Social Club&quot;.  Such an amazing story, such brillant musical tallent; it's impossible to describe!  You have to see it to &quot;experience&quot; the &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I got a little preview of greendale at the end of July when I made the trip to denver (Neil never comes to Salt Lake any more!)to se Neil at Red Rocks. The first set of both shows was Greendale in its entirety. I'll be honest, Initially I didn't know how I was going to feel about this album. As a matter of fact I was pretty sure I was going to hate it. I thought to myself, \\"How dare they play songs that I can't sing along with!\\" I picked it up anyway because I didn't think I'd be much of a fan if I drove 500 miles to see him play and didn't even give the album a shot. I must say, it's growing on me. The bonus DVD with the acoustic versions of all of the songs on the album really sheds light on the essence of what this material is all about. When I listen to this album I recall the times I saw it live with the actors on stage with the band acting out the story of Greendale and it gives me a new point of view on the music that I didn't have when I first saw this show.<br />To Sum up this review, If you have seen Neil on his current tour, pick this up and it will give you a new appreciation for the music. If you weren't lucky enough to catch Neil playing these songs buy it any way and watch the DVD a couple of times. Not only is the DVD alone worth the purchase price but It will give you a better understanding of the story that this living legend is telling us.

B00009ATIX|5.0|First the movie is a remake of a 1972 classic named the same.  A remake with George Clooney was not a big Must See on my list, but I couldnt help it.  This movie amazed me.  Really amazed me.  The use of music may hav made this a bit strange feeling movie as a soundtrack is used to create emotion, but it made for a masterfully climax and really added to the beauty of it.  George Clooney was fantastic, making one of those rare against type characters which is either not allowed in Hollywood or considered pretentious.  He was great-a great actor not just showman.  The mood of the movie made the famous butt shot an addition to the movie not a special feature.  A really worthy film and while it still has a hollywood vibe it actually makes people over 16 think.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil young is his own man, as all we fans know, this cd/dvd is of the high quality we come to expect from our man, This is probably the killer of future to come. A man daring to go on the road with completely new material( GREENDALE) thru Europe with most of the show dedicated to Greendale and some golden oldies. Some concert-go-ers expecting the HIT MACHINE that would be very simple, but instead playing new material that will become CLASSICAL (Greendale) Do not buy just the CD buy the CD/DVD instead, you will receive a truly great and classic cd/dvd<br />ps. I´m sorry for the rewiever in AFTONBLADET in Sweden who only gave this album ** out of ***** , he expected a re-deja vu of the concert Neil did last year.<br />Advise: Buy CD/DVD, aftonbladet´s reporter RESIGN or Justify your case better.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Here we have a magnificent overview of Neil Young's imagination. It is one rooted in the now. Real people in a decaying world. Perhaps with only one true survivor.<br />The melodies are classic Neil Young in classic voice and classic &quot;grunge&quot;/acoustic guitar. This is one of his perfect records.<br />It is a Concept. The album is one story, but a true test is that any given song can stand alone.<br />If this were to be his final work, Neil Young has completed a musical vision with flying colors.<br />Kicking.
0375422307|5.0|I picked up Persepolis and did not put it down until I reached the last page.  I then found myself wishing there was more and quickly flipped back and began reading many of the sections and staring at the stark but expressive drawings again.  Marjane Satrapi's story of a few years of her youth is filled with the universal turbulent emotions of being a young teenager, but her experience has the added dimension of living those years as a young woman under an oppressive totalitarian regime.  The graphic stories are linked together to show how Satrapi develops emotionally and physically as a young person in a time in history that was filled with fear, confusion, protest, death, and anger, but also tenderness, love, and occassional celebration. Her story  and essential accompanying drawings are simple but profound as they teach about Iranian history while also reinforcing the universally confounding and exciting experience of being a teenager when one is self-absorbed and rebellious, but also forced to step into the realities and disenchanted nature of the adult world. Fortunately for us, Satrapi is able to bring her own experiences to life beautifully through her black and white drawings and in doing so illustrates both the joy and darkness of the human experience.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is an engaging literary prose that will leave you spellbound once you have finished the book. With a tiger named Richard Parker, this book goes beyond the threshold of fables- A wondrous, wondrous treat...a literary masterpiece!<br />Buy the book! You will not regret it!
B000002TQV|5.0|After the enormous success of the single \\"Creep\\" and non-stop touring, Radiohead released this wonderful masterpiece.  If you're only familiar with the modern-day Radiohead, this album may come as a shock to you.  It is a very accessible and guitar-oriented album, nothing like the prog-rock of OK Computer or Kid A's electronic noodling.  It's sound is closer to Pablo Honey, but the sound is WAAAAY better.  All of the songs are very powerful and emotional and shift dynamics very nicely.  All of the band members shine on this disc, creating a beautiful lanscape of sound that you'll want to hear again and again.  Standout tracks include: \\"Planet Telex\\", \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"Just\\", and \\"Bullet proof...I wish I was\\".  If you are new to Radiohead, this is the album to start with.  From there, I'd recommend OK Computer, Hail to the Thief, Kid A, Amnesiac, and Pablo Honey (in that order).
B0000AXE8I|3.0|This movie was pretty cool, but I had higher expectations than the film delivered. I would have given the film 3.5 stars if the rating were avalible, but I decided to leave it at 3 rather than rounding up. My largest complaint would have to be the whole Zion Orgy/Sex Scene. What was this doing in here? It served no purpose other than to secure an R rating, and it was so dragged out that it cut into the the pacing of an already slow to start film. So basically, I don't see why it was in there to begin with. In the theater, I used the time the scene gave me to refill my popcorn. With the DVD, thankfully I can click the \\"next chapter\\" button. Much like the Enter the Matrix videogame wich launched similtaniousely, the movie has enough good points to justify putting up with the dissapointments, but it still fails to live up to the hype miserably (okay, \\"Miserably\\" is way to harsh a word to describe either of them, but it's all I can think of that sounds good). I still enjoyed the film quite a bit, but I think the Wachowski brothers got a bit too cocky from their sucsess with the first film, much like Rowland Emmeric and Dean Devlin with the steller Independence Day and the fun, but flawed Godzilla remake. A director's cut treatment with this DVD could have done marvels, provided that they trimmed out all the un-desirable material (read: ZION ORGY/SEX SCENE, amongst others) and improved the pacing, but it looks like the Wachowskis don't want to alter their \\"masterpiece\\" at all. But hey, we still get a second disc loaded with goodies, and if you really hate the film that much, you can always just watch the action scenes.
B000067CPX|5.0|the chili peppers latest cd \\"by the way\\" is nothing less but brilliant. i love almost 12 tracks on this cd. my personal favorites on this cd would be venice queen, the zephyr song and this is the place. by the way, cant stop and dosed got the most radio play outta their 4 singles (zephyr song being one of them). universally speaking was their international single, which is slow paced, u should like it after around 4 times of listenin to it. it grows on u. other songs that are good are cabron, tear, dont forget me, throw away your television, i could die for you. <br />the person who made this cd what it is tho, is john frusciante. his guitar work as well as his harmonies with anthony shine in this cd. his guitaring did get extremely better compared to californication (which was also a great cd). he shows such soul and compassion in his music, especially on this cd.<br />flea changed a bit on this cd. using bass chords more often and havin more simple bass lines. one thing thats changed greatly in his bass playing, is that he uses a pick on most of the songs on this album (dont forget me, zephyr song), he always uses droped D tuning in a couple of songs. <br />the peppers are growing older and are becoming a lot calmer. they are maturing as we speak. this is a preview of what is to come.<br />a must buy.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Hello: I saw Alison Krauss and Union Station live on TV, and had to have this album. I used it as a gift as well, I think it doesn't get much better than this, such talent, as good as the Dixie Chicks and James Taylor (which I thought was a 6 in a 5 star rating). I recommend this album to all.
B000002MFE|4.0|I must admit that when one of our generation's finest electric guitarists transformed himself into a singer-songwriter a number of years ago I was not impressed. I understood his reasons but just didn't connect with the music. But this set for MTV's &quot;Unplugged&quot; series could convert the most diehard Cream fan.<br />There are the requisite traditional blues numbers (including two of Robert Johnson's) played with reverence but lacking the emotional impact of the originals. There's a fine version of his touching Tears in Heaven, a perfect match for his voice. San Francisco Bay Blues is rollicking good fun. Alberta had the audience rockin' along.<br />But buy the CD for the four songs that earned it four stars: The set takes off with cut six's version of Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out. This is followed by the by-now-well-known reworking of Layla. It's remarkable that the artist could produce two such dramatically different but successful readings of his own song. Both the loud and powerful original Derek and the Dominoes version and this slower ballad are stunning. Layla is followed by Running on Faith, maybe the best performance of the set. And then there's Old Love, featuring guitar (EC) and piano (Chuck Leavell) jazz solos. Everyone plays well, the background singing by Katie Kissoon and Tessa Niles fills in nicely on several cuts, and the audience clearly had a good time. You will too listening to this performance. <br />Add Unplugged to Best of Cream, Layla, and Blind Faith as essential Clapton components of your collection.
0060007737|4.0|This book does a great job of boiling down some of the most important factors of corporate branding into 22 well organized groups. I don't believe by any means that these \\"laws\\" are immutable, but I think they provide great insight into the basics of brand development. Having said that, I wouldn't suggest relying solely on this book if you are trying to establish a strong brand for your own organization. Hire a professional firm.<br />While I found this book to be very concise in form and organization, I did not appreciate how the authors make some of their subjective observations into fact, especially in the \\"11 immutable laws of internet branding\\" section of the book. I definitely recommend this book, but as they say: \\"Don't believe everything you read\\".
0783226845|5.0|Pacino is best known for his gangster portrayals or for his portrayals of Satan or politicians (but wait, I guess those are all the same things, aren't they?).<br />Scent of a Woman is a sensitive portrayal fully worthy of the Best Actor Academy Award garnered by Pacino for his role.  One comes to believe that Pacino is truly blind as he stares blankly at his fellow actors.  Chris O'Donnell is exceptional as Pacino's much younger pal and &quot;babysitter.&quot;  A great human drama, Scent of a Woman is a story of redemption that speaks volumes about the challenges, large and small, that all of us face.  If we read to know that we are not alone, Scent of a Woman accomplishes equal empathy in a motion picture.  <br />Buy it for the Corvette scene.  Absolutely terrific.  I recall that the subtitle for the movie Superman was &quot;You will believe a man can fly.&quot;  Perhaps the subtitle to this one should be &quot;You'll believe and blind man can drive...FAST!&quot;  Great movie!

B00008NRLX|5.0|This is a beautiful disc that picks you up from the opening all the way through to the end.  The Jayhawks seem to have really found their stride, and their voice, for the first time since Mark Olson left the band a few years back.  Gary Louris' material really shines.  You can't help get wrapped up by tunes like &quot;Angelyne&quot; and &quot;Save it for a Rainy Day&quot;.<br />This isn't just &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot;, so don't &quot;Save it for a Rainy Day&quot;, and listen to it TODAY!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I never listened any Soundgarden prior to finding Audioslave, unless I have but just don't know the songs by thier name or whatever, and I liked Rage Against the Machine...mainly because I'm a musician and I was impressed by Morello and the rest of the band, and wasnt always so impressed by Zach's vocals. So when I first saw &quot;Cochise&quot; playing late on MTV I was blown away by Chris Cornell's voice...for some reason I have to say I thought he sounded like the lead singer of AC/DC at first, lol. Only stronger.After listening to &quot;Like a Stone&quot; on MTV I was hooked, they would only play music videos in the morning before I went to school, I would wait 5 minutes for that song to get over and I would almost miss my bus. I then downloaded &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot;, &quot;Gasoline&quot;, and &quot;What You Are&quot;..and then I decided I was just going to get the CD. Although the first 5 songs(from which are the only ones Ive heard up to this point) are somewhat different than the rest of the CD, I wasn't disappointed at all. It's a good variety, anyone who liked Soundgarden or Rage Against the Machine definatly should get this CD, but if you're looking for music exactually to Rage's you might be a little disappointed, RATM (the band minus the singer) has evolved, and thats how they stay good. Anyone into good rock music should get this CD. Anyone willing to get inspired in some way, should get this CD...as I've been inspired to start singing. It hasn't left my CD player since me getting it, get it!!!!
B00005OAIE|2.0|The two songs you hear from this set on the radio are pleasant slices of pop. IT is too bad then to discover that the rest of the album lacks the creative spark, melodies and energy that the 2 singles do. <br />Wait for the best of is my advice.
B000001AJG|5.0|I am one of the biggest Stevie Wonder fans in the world. Which means that I am very critical of his work at the same time that I praise his work. The Secret Life of Plants has always been, from day one, to me an amazing album. I've always put it even higher than his other masterwork Songs in the Key of Life. In order to really appreciate it though you must open your mind and heart and really listen. At the time it was released I was studying music in college so I understood the classical music leanings of the album. Because the album is so huge I will only review the songs that I believe are standouts. Earth's Creation: Stevie depicts the very violent and chaotic beginnings of our world with sreeching violins, a rumbling bassline and tons of dissonance from the synthesizers. A Incredibly different beginning to a great piece of music. First Garden: Stevie depicts the first song/life appearing on earth in this one. You hear birds singing in rhythm and water drops, stones falling all in rhythm. This leads to a harmonica solo from him that makes you believe that the harmonica could be included as an orchestral instrument. The harmonica solo drifts into more of nature's song which drifts into a quartet of strings playing a tune we would hear later on on the album (Come Back As A Flower). All of this is exquisite and shows the global vision of the disc. Same Old Story: Stevie sings of the unfairness shown to pioneers such as Dr. Bose and George Washington-Carver. Two minorities who's work and ideas were not taken seriously by the rest of the scientific world until it could not be overlooked. The song is done with a very \\"country/hillbilly\\" sound, mostly in the bass that makes it sound very down home and friendly. Yet Stevie's voice is amazing as it at once aches for them and at the same time is arguing for them. A must hear. Send One your Love: The ONLY hit from the disc. It's a very pretty pop song and Stevie keeps it interesting by doing some cool things in the studio.Example: he tapes the cymbal and plays it through the synthesizer throughout the song to get a very cool sound effect. More importantly, it's the start of an incredible suite of songs on side 3 of the original album. Outside My Window:During an interview once Stevie mentions that when he wrote I Just Called To Say I Love You he was trying to write the best sing-a-long song ever. First off, why would a talent as HUGE as Stevie WANT to write a sing-a-long? Who knows. Either way it seems that he did what he set out to do. The song is an 80's staple and it won an OSCAR!!! Outside My Window is a sing-a-long but in the best definition of the word. It's catchy yet interesting musically. Stevie has the nature rhythm section working again with a cool sound effect of a swiping sound throughout. The bassline is very cool and the percussion is all over the place. A very good song. It's lite but still a standout of the disc. Black Orchid: Black Orchid is the second best ballad he's ever done (Lately from Hotter Than July is number one in my book). It is a multi-layered/meaning song co-written by Yvonne Wright. This, unfortunately is the 3rd and last song they did together. Where did this amazing poet go? The song speaks of the relationship between Man and the fabeled black orchid (the legendary flower of everlasting life), the Black woman, Black people and God. As you can see, lyrically it's heavy but Stevie gives us beautiful and interesting music to go along with the lyrics. Again, the bassline is flawless, the drum part is majestic, the piano part is detached at the beginning yet it flows into the rest of the song coupled with a harpsichord. All this is made wider by the srting part. It's a classic ballad done by a classic balladeer. DON'T MISS IT!. Kesse Ye Lolo Deye: Roughly that translates to \\"a seeds a star\\", which harkens back to an acient African belief of life on Earth coming from a distant star that \\"seeded\\" the planet. The whole song is sung in the native language backed solely by african instrumentation (some if which Stevie learned to play for the disc!). A great song that again, reminds us of the vision of the album. Come Back As A Flower: Stevie's ex Syreeta (God rest her soul) wrote the lyrics for this one. It's another lite song message wise but it shows how a great songwriter like Stevie can make this type of song seem like so much more than just a pop song. Syreeta's bell like voice works perfectly here as does Stevie's soft harmonies and piano part. A hint: after the lyrics end, don't turn off the disc because the song hasn't ended yet. Stevie continues the song with the sounds of nature for another 3 or so minutes before it finally ends. Just lovely. The Secret Life Of Plants: The title song and a beautiful one at that. The motif you've been hearing throughout the album is finally heard in it's entirety. Stevie has always been known as a master of chord progression and harmonies and this song subtely shows you why. It's beautifully written and performed. Tree: This song shows the majesty and beauty of earths largest living creature, the tree. It's all piano and synth with booming sound effects doubling as a huge storm. And you (and the storm) stand in awe as the tree withstands the wrath of the powerful storm! Finale: The journey is coming to an end here so Stevie has us revisit many of the themes we've already heard earlier. What's different and cool is that for many he uses the counter-melody of the song so we actually have to listen and figure out which song it really is. This is done best on a string solo of Come Back As A Flower's counter-melody. GREAT! It all ends with a very Beethoven-like ending, which is totally fitting for the incredible journey Stevie's brought us through. Stevie Wonder's Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants is a major masterwork by an incredible musician and artist. To me, it shows Stevie's farreaching genius better than any of his other works. To me this, not Songs In The Key Of Life, is the pinnacle of his career. When originally released, it was panned by the critics and the public was just confused. Twentysome years later it is considered to be a classic and ahead of it's time. It was the first New Age album and still by far the best. WIth songs like Kesse Ye Lolo Deye and Voyage To India on it, it made world music more interesting and accessible to the American public. And the synth driven 80's and early 90's owe a lot to it too. He's a genius, what can I say? If you are a Stevie fan, or just a fan of great, enlightening music, BUY THIS ALBUM! It's a journey worth your while.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is in many ways the best thing ever released under the Beatles banner (I'll save the whole `is it really Paul's first solo effort' to the experts). There is not a duff track here and the range, while maybe not quiet as extreme as The White Album, is certainly broad. Side two, the side that clearly is Paul at work, is perhaps the best album side ever made. The songs work well together yet stand separately on their own. <br />And George Martin was in top form here. Listen closely to Come Together and you will be amazed at what he and the \\"boys\\" got out of a 16 track recorder before there was anything even dreamed of called a sampler. Something is in many ways the best Beatles single ever (imho of course), and I Want You (she' so Heavy) is a great counter weight to Harrison's perfect love song. <br />If you only want a few Beatles album (get them all! Get them all!) then by all means pick up the Red and the Blue or just \\"1\\" even, but consider delving just a tad into their genius and start by owning this masterpiece. (And yes, you can pick up this first before you own the delightful but somewhat over rated Sgt Pepper's)
B0000025P9|4.0|This is Toto at their peak of popularity. IV contains all-time eighties classic pop tracks like &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;i won't hold you down&quot; and the memorable &quot;Africa&quot;.Every song could be potencial hit twenty years ago but sadly now the whole album is sounding a bit annoying.the production and aranges are simply sounding old. Well, but still under the whole 80's stuff we have a solid pop-rock album - the melodies are very pleasent and it is a perfect album for a summer holiday or car riding.without any serious lyrics (mostly the lyrics are containing things like &quot;i saw you yesterday and i loved you&quot; or &quot;please forgive me and don't break my heart&quot; stuff) or ecological and global warnings popular then &quot;TOTO IV&quot; can give you 40 minutes of enjoyment and fun.If you like eighties music you will love this album after first listening...if you don't you will leave this propably.<BR>well - still it is a pop and rock classic work.

0780631684|1.0|I'm a horror buff, and I'm always open to different movies that involve some kind of gore, possible spychological suspense, and atleast good acting with a solid storyline.  You know what this movie did?  Made me feel stupid.  Final Destination didn't even have something close to any intellectual level, and although I don't expect a horror movie to be smart, I expect the storyline atleast to be solid.  Instead, these teenagers find that 'death' is constantly creeping up on them.  Is this a good storyline?  Yes, but not solid.  Obviously, death is not a tangible form, which is an original thought, but it just doesn't work for this movie when they naturally take the advice from the Candyman, (Otherwise known as the Morgue keeper) who says cryptic stuff.  This bothered me above all else, because who would take the advice from a complete and total stranger, even a morgue keeper?  If somebody said to me, \\"Boy, death is a comin', and I be seein' you soon\\" I would naturally dub this guy a 'lunatic.' Do the protagonists?  No!  They actually take his advice, believing that he's all of a sudden a wise man or something, when they've never even met him! Some skepticism would have worked, you know, but did they throw in the slightest bit of skepticism?  Oh no, that would make the characters half realistic!  And we don't want that, because they're only gonna die anyways, so what does it matter, man?!  The dialogue was completely and totally stale, boring, and, like every other thing in this movie, unrealistic.  Were they intending this to be a kids movie before changing the rating?<BR>     Bottom line is this:...this is bubblegum horror, candy-coded to make it look cool when really it just comes off as an awfully horrible hype that only eight year olds will find the slightest bit scary.  Do you want some good, real, fun, disturbing horror or suspense?  Try these movies below:<BR>     Last House on the Left<BR>     Texas Chainsaw Massacre<BR>     Friday the Thirteenth<BR>     The Excorcist<BR>     Rosemary's Baby<BR>     <BR>    Wanna watch some 'recent' flicks that could be put in the horror or suspense genre?  Watch the movies below:<BR>    <BR>     Jeepers Creepers<BR>     Sixth Sense<BR>     Signs<BR>     <BR>     The horror genre is in a slump right now...and its very, very unfortunate.  The acting in Final Destination was just horrible, the storyline was sloppy (Although more original than most) and the acting was...disgusting.  Just right out disgusting.  I don't think I've ever seen such bad acting...I'm not even an actor, and I could probably act with more devotion!  When the actors try to be good in this flick, the lines come out sounding exaggerated and too sappy...just don't watch it.  It's a waste of time, believe me.
B00009ATIX|1.0|This has to be the worst movie that is out right now for rental or purchase.  I run a video rental store and I have heard nothing but bad news about this movie.  Half the people couldn't get through it because they fell asleep, and another 25 percent stopped watching it before the movie ended.  I disliked it to the most intentions.  The music in the background has one tone playing from soft to loud for 2 hours straight, after hearing this I got a migraine and got dizzy, which I cured with some medicine.  the plot goes nowhere and at the end of the film you say this &quot;bluwah?&quot;  I recomend this movie to no one.  Even if you read the book you should not see this movie because it will probably ruin the book.  This movie should end George Clooney's career because it is such an embarassment to both him, his fans, and the entertainment world.
B00005JKHN|3.0|I'm sure this won't be a popular opinion in this forum, but I tell it like I see it. After the overwhelming feedback from my first version of this review, I thought it might be good to clarify a few viewpoints to maybe help others accept an opinion different from their own. <br />As with all of the Disney special edition DVD releases, the quality spoils you for the multitude of other older films put out on DVD from other labels without the care and expertise of video and audio restoration in which Disney obviously is a master. Yet another wonderful job was done on this film. If you are already a fan of Sleeping Beauty I'm sure this package will knock your socks off. Buy it now, (and don't worry about the rest of this review.) I just still don't get why anyone would be a particular fan of this one over the far superior and memorable Snow White, Dumbo, Toy Story 1 & 2, Roger Rabbit, etc, etc. <br />I know I saw this as a kid on the BIGGGG screen in the first few years after it came out. I didn't like it then, and it was so forgetable I didn't remember hearing any of the music before, and only remembered seeing some of the scenes. Probably slept through it 40 years ago. I still find it to be slow paced, plodding and basically boring compared to those other Disney classics. I watched this DVD with my wife (who also didn't care much for it as a kid, or in this cleaned up version) and our 3 young kids (2 boys & 1 girl). The kids were completely disinterested through out the film. They had a great time when we showed them Snow White and Dumbo. The multitude of extras included didn't interest us much either, it's nice they are there if you are really into this movie. One of the main complaints I have with this movie (besides plodding) over the other older Disney classics is actually with the animation. Sure, it's nice to be in widescreen, but all those wonderfully detailed backgrounds don't go with the style of the characters put on top. Most of the characters are quite simply drawn, fairly flat and plain. They don't blend well with their surroundings. Snow White and Dumbo don't have that problem.<br />If you already specifically love this movie, for what ever reason, you'll love the quality of this DVD set. If you are after the truely great unforgettable Disney classic about a beautiful girl in a deep sleep, woken up by the kiss of a handsome prince--well that would be Snow White. If you are just looking for a wonderfully FUN family movie, you are on the wrong page again--that would be the Toy Stories and Who Framed Roger Rabbit! Or venture beyond Disney, and treat your whole family to the incredible DVD of Yellow Submarine.<br />Unless you just have to own THIS movie, do yourself and your kids a favor and buy any of the other truely great and entertaining Disney classics instead. Because it's not a shoe-in your kids will like this.
0553573403|5.0|Quite frankly I don't understand how people could not like this book. The mind boggles. Too truly enjoy this book yes you need to be patient. But it's worth it. It's completely worth it.<br />I received this book as a Christmas gift last year. It took me six months to finally get around and read it as I had to expend every other source of the printed word I owned. I was very dubious.<br />After finishing this book, I was incredibly thankful that I had also been given the second. Which I began to devour.<br />Too many people seem to want to fall into standard fantasy patterns, especially when regarding this book. Because quite frankly there aren't &quot;good guys&quot; and after getting to know the &quot;bad guys&quot; you realize that they're not so bad after all. Now that's good writing.<br />The theme of people saying this book or series &quot;drags&quot; seem to thoroughly enjoy Jordan's Wheel of Tedium...I mean Time. Wheel of Time. Well allow me to say that more relevant plot points occurs in the course of one Song of Ice and Fire book than does in three of Jordan's book.<br />Not to give anything away, but more than once in this book I was absolutely shocked at the unfolding of events.<br />This book is a trek, to the top of a mountain. It takes time, but the sights you see on the way their and the view from the top, make it all worth while.
B0000630YA|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" is the greatest musical triumph ever to be made by the Godfather of Shock Rock. This monster solo debut marks a critical period when Alice Cooper departs from his recently disbanded garage band and solely concocts a devious, innovative formula of grand theatrical showmanship. \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" is, in fact, a perfectly orchestrated spook soundtrack which blends pulsating rock rhythms with elements of vaudeville and Broadway musical tunes. As the velvet curtain rises to expose the stage, Cooper dons the top hat of a devilish ringmaster; as indicated by the album's opening title track, he cordially invites curious spectators into his cadaverous crypt cabaret. Of course, that's just the beginning. With shock and surprises lurking behind every corner, Cooper's fiendishly clever lyrics incorporate unspeakable violence and gore with elaborate stage spectacle. The special guest appearance of horror film master Vincent Price on \\"Devil's Food\\" is simply priceless; it's clear he enjoys being a Hollywood ham! \\"Black Widow\\" is a disturbing track about a bloodthirsty arachnid who is worshipped by her enslaved servants as she voraciously devours their flesh; this track may as well concern any voluptuous woman who is capable of luring men to their doom. The simple yet hilarious \\"Some Folks\\" is heavily inspired by Fred Astaire; it's a catchy tap dance number discussing the wholesome subject of cannibalism! Even more frightening is \\"Only Women Bleed,\\" a seemingly tender ballad about domestic violence; during the sweeping instrumental segments, one can almost vision the bruised and terrified wife being punched and kicked repeatedly by her drunken spouse. \\"Cold Ethyl\\" is a hysterical rock & roll song where Alice commits the act of necrophilia: with wisecracks upstaging a screaming metal guitar solo, he belts out a graphic description of a nude corpse preserved in the refrigerator! These are just some creepy highlightsawaiting listeners. Now that it's digitally remastered, the sound quality of \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" is better than ever before. Don't forget to check out the CD's 3 bonus tracks, which were recorded from Cooper's 1975 ABC television special (also take notice of the songs' alternate lyrics).
B000068OSK|4.0|The album is great, but why do people still think that Jack and Meg are brother and sister? They were married, and Jack took Meg's last name.
B00005JM09|4.0|Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines delivers another satisfying dose of mechanistic mythology.  It is a kinetic fireball which sears and seethes itself across the screen, fast-paced images flipping by with an abandon that is hard to keep up with, all the while daring the viewer to try as best s/he can.  From the opening apocalyptic prologue of the oncoming holocaust at the metallic hands of the feral-looking shiny exoskeleton automatons to the final desperate coda, the film engulfs you in its speedy wit and voracious velocity.<br />John Connor has grown up since last we saw him in T2; even though the tenebrous vision of Judgment Day has been ostensibly vanquished due to the prior actions of he, his mother, and the T-800, the young man finds himself still troubled and haunted by nightmares and phobias connected to that horrific moment when Skynet realizes that it can think and decides to reject its organic creators with cruel prejudice, just as a vicious pack of antibodies will rebuff a much-needed transplanted organ.  Connor learns soon enough, however, that history is about to repeat itself: a new Terminator- the TX- has looped through the fourth dimension to destroy him and his future wife, Kate Brewster; they are destined to lead the resistance against the machines...and from whom does he get this information?  From none other than the T800, the same model sent to kill his mother in the first movie and then to protect her in the second film.  The formula is repeated, with Schwarzenegger as the cyborg version of a superhuman Secret Service agent, doing anything and everything it can to protect his human charges.  <br />As one can imagine, the ante is upped considerably with T3.  The chases, stunts, car crashes, shotgun blasts, fiery combustions, property destruction, special effects- all of it is befitting a movie of this type in these contemporary times, even if it isn't necessarily seminal in any specific fashion; perhaps the best way to put it is that T3 pays appropriate homage to the history of the franchise even though it does not come up with any fundamentally unique presentational templates.  In fact, to hammer this point home even further, it is extremely interesting to note that the absence of the guiding hand of one of celluloid's most recent godheads- James Cameron- is filled amiably enough by the people in charge of this outing.  Not having the captain behind the Titanic phenomenon calling the shots on this new dystopian vision of a future corrupted and raped by technology which has adopted and amplified the worst of mankind's failings is as anathema as the suggestion that George Lucas should have nothing to do with the next episode of his Annikin Skywalker trilogy; stony perceptions can sometimes be jackhammered through, though, and this is an example of such.  <br />Schwarzenegger plays the iconic robot the same as ever: stiff, stoic, superhuman...and with an equal amount of humor.  This is the Austrian's most recognizable role, and his fans will never let him forget it; still, he does not resist the box he's been placed in- instead, he makes the best of this claustrophobic chamber and stretches the limitations as far as he's able.  The female menace is essentially the T1000 with a sex change, and that's okay- why alter the specs too radically?  And while no one will ever accuse T3 of diving into the depths of profound proclamations for purposes of dictating various dissertations to the masses through subtextual theses existing in shadowy tandem with the stunning visual flair executed on the superficial level, it is notable to consider the essential statement coded in the central core of the plot's DNA: that the future- destiny- is not the rubber mechanism we want it to be, and for one to think it is anything but immutable is to willingly invite supercilious contaminants into the individual's ego.  <br />T3 is faster and more furious than any greenlighted Vin Diesel vehicle; at a lean/mean 110 minutes, it's worth the ride.
0375703764|1.0|This is by far the worst thing I have EVER read. It reads like a textbook, which I think it's supposed to (great idea, really great). No character development, story, plot, climax, or anything remotely interesting. I would rather be a gerbal on Fire Island during an Elton John concert than read this book again.
6302206294|3.0|There is an old saying that &quot;crime does not pay &quot; but I suggest that actors can be excluded from this, since a great many have made a good living by playing the bad guy .One such is Alan Rickman and his extra - ordinary performance  as the Sheriff of Nottingham is by far the best thing in this retread of the Robin Hood legend.His camp ,flambouyant and arch performance owes much to the English pantomime tradition of the hissable villain ,and he seems to be playing to the gallery and enjoying himself enormously without quite descending to parody.  He rules the roost in  dank and dingy Nottingham castle with the aid of his pet sorceress ,nicely played by Geraldine McEwan.<BR>Set alongside Rickman ,Kevin Costner comes over as  bland and anodyne and is no match for past luminaries like Flynn ,Connery and Fairbanks who have tackled the role with elan and distinction.The interpretation is too heroic , clean cut and  self righteousness ,to ever really impose itself on the movie.<br />The familiar story is given a new airing  with Robin returning from the Crusades to discover his lands appropriated ;his father dead at the hands of the sheriffs men and the poor groaning under the weight of taxes.And to top all this his beloved Maid Marion is about to tie the knot with the sheriff.Robin -with Saracen friend Azeem in tow -joins up with a band of outlaws in Sherwood Forest to challenge the  ruling tyranny.New ingredients for the early nineties audience include sorcery ,flip dialogue and some psychological perspectives but essentially its the old tale retold<BR>The action set pieces are well done and there are enough scenes of swordplay and archery to satisfy most<BR> viewers but it needs tighter  editing and better pacing to grip consistently.<BR>Freeman is excellent as Azeem and Mastrantonio make a spirited early feminist Marion <br />Its an enjoyable movie but I mark it down for the colourless performance of Costner -who is not a bad actor but is simply miscast-and the excessive running time
B000002C1V|5.0|This is the last Roger Waters led Pink Floyd album. It's also very good. This album got a bad rap and was called a Roger Waters solo album under the name Pink Floyd. Even though Waters wrote every song on here, Gilmour's presence is clear. Buy it, but definitely not for beginners
B00005JKC3|1.0|The acting is too contrived. The villain is way cheesey. The movie is soooo slow. Guys just use your money to buy any Hulk comics helmed by Peter David. At least then you wouldnt go crazy over the sloooooow pacing and utter stupidity of the movie.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album is absolutely incredible.  I bought it last night and listened to it 4 times strait through and I still wanted more.  If Sparta is At the Drive In's Foo Fighters then I don't even know what that makes The Mars Volta.  Simply astounding.  Some of my favorites are: Drunkship of Lanterns, Roulette Dares, Televators, and... well they're all good.  Go out and buy this record.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I have the Criterion Laserdisc of this Technicolor marvel and I just wanted to add my two bits about Rudy Behlmer's commentary on that disc.  It is worth the price of the video itself.  Mr. Behlmer offers fascinating scholarly and anecdotal comments about the history of the Robin Hood legend and the making of the film.  I will probably head straight for his commentary when the disc arrives!
B000062XLZ|5.0|Having read the book and seen several versions of the musical on film and on stage, and being a true lover of the story of Anna Leonowens' experiences as teacher to the children of the King of Siam, I can honestly say that this is the most beautiful rendering of this tale I have yet to see.  Whether or not she got the accent right (it really doesn't matter), Jodie Foster delivers a stunning performance as Anna, and the actor (I'm sorry, but I don't remember his name) who portrays the king is every bit as good as Jodie.  This film captures the true emotions of the king and Anna as they struggle with the impossible attraction they have for each other and the frustration they feel at trying to comprehend one another's cultures.  Definitely worth purchasing on DVD, as this film is visually magnificent.
B00009XITP|5.0|I just watched this movie last night and I absolutely loved it! It made me laugh and it made me cry..it had a good mix of everything! The plot to the movie I found was somewhat similar to princess diaries and I also love that movie. The clothes in this movie were incredible also and Amanda Bynes was untterly amazing in the Role of Daphne Reynolds Dashwood. Her father was also a very good actor He's one of my favorites!<BR>I definately recommend that people see this movie it has a good message and it's very enjoyable!
B00005V9HH|5.0|Like the ending of \\"Carrie\\", this one is completely unexpected.  Unlike the ending of \\"Carrie\\", this one makes you want to see the movie over and over.  I'm still amazed at how good an actor Kevin Spacey is here. Well done. Classic.
B00008H2LE|3.0|Linkin Park is a talented band that takes a lot of time to perfect their music.  So my question is, why is this so short?  The CD is about 4 minutes shy of 40 minutes.  Reanimation was about an hour and Hybrid Theory was 40 minutes, making Meteora the shortest LP album availible.  The DVD was interesting but not worth the extra cash.  You're not going to watch it more than twice.  I suggest going to a friends house and watching it and buying the regular version of the CD.  In some ways I felt robbed after I bought this CD.  All the songs essentialy had the same sound to them as Hybrid Theory since they were created back before Hybrid was even released. (Lyrics and beats.)  If you ask me I think you should keep the money.  You hear most of the songs on the radio anyway and there just isn't enough meat to make it a worthy puchase.  I do however reccomend it to die hard Linkin Park fans.  Let's hope LP makes a long and fresh Junior album in the future.
0060536357|5.0|It reads like a thriller.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  It is the story of the RJR Nabisco buyout through the eyes of two journalists and it shows that a real world story can be just as dramatic as fiction.  This book is one of the most important documentaries of the 1980s.
B00007E8V4|4.0|This is an excellent CD.  It features unreleased songs that are actualy good and sounds like an entirely new SOAD album.  I prefer Toxcicity over it, but it's still a worthy purchase for heavy metal fans.
B00005JLET|5.0|the 451 amazonians already covered pretty much every aspect of the film.and most of them gave it a five star.so what are you waiting for? buy it.<BR>my second miyazaki film ,after (mononoke).actually the third after discovering (warriors of the wind) was also a miyazaki's.saw it way back in the mid 90's.wasn't that great.a miyazaki fan site said the reason was because of the unapproved editing by the company that did the dubbing.for more info go to studio ghibli site.<BR>my mother liked.my father liked it ,and said it reminded him of his childhood bed time stories.they don't speak english. and i ,definitely ,liked too.<BR>the story.well,do you remember ,when you were a child ,that you really believed strange creatures lived in deserted houses,well this film is all about that .in a japanese flavour of course.<BR>there are some scary moments! do you remember the first scene the monkey tribe in (mononoke) appeared?spooky.in this film it's doubled.especially noface.parents be warned
B00004Z459|4.0|This CD is only 40 minutes long, which is kinda short but it feels like it's 10 minutes.  At least it's one of those albums you'll like to listen to again and again.  I can only reccomend it to the crowd who likes replay value over length.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Best sound and picture so far, that what I was looking for. The film looks better than ever. I didn't want/need the extra TV version to take away from the original. Good job. Don't miss it, especially if you don't already have it in your collection. Picture is crisp and the sound is great. Sit back and ENJOY!
B000084T18|2.0|I find 50 to be a decent rapper.  I think he is way overhyped however, and dosen't have as much talent as many other less popular rappers.  This CDs executive producer was Eminem but you can't compare the two.  50 is a gangster rapper while Em is just an insane rapper.  Eminem however, has far more talent then 50 cent when it comes down to lyrics and originality.  The only stand out tracks on this album (other than many men) are the ones he's featured on.  The rest of them are a bunch of I'll kill you, I'll blow your brains out, smoke a joint, etc. etc. kind of stuff. It's the kind of garbage you hear from a mediocre and uninventive rapper.  So unless you really like rap regardless of who or what it is, skip this one, and don't buy into the hype.
B00008NRLX|5.0|These guys have never dissaponted me. From their earlier work &quot; Blue earth &quot;, the two country-rock classics &quot; Hollywood Town Hall&quot; &amp; &quot;Tomorrow the green grass &quot; , the beautiful comeback album &quot;The Sound of lies&quot; to the pop-beauty of &quot;Smile&quot;. Never a dull moment with the Jayhawks.And this one is right on target again. The openingtrack &quot; Stumbling through the dark &quot;, which sounds like a close relative of &quot;Mr Tambourine man&quot;, will soon bee a classic itself. &quot; All the right reasons &quot; is probably one of the best ballads that Gary Louris has ever written. The country-rockers &quot;Tailspin&quot; &amp; &quot; Save it for a rainy day &quot; come crawling in your head and never leave.<BR>If I 'd be American ( which I'm not...I'm from Belgium...yes, it's a country ),I would be very, very proud of the Jayhawks. Cherish them !!
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is a classic Metal album that you will listen to again and again.  There should be no doubt in your mind when it comes to puchasing this CD.  It's just too good to say no to.
B00009RGBS|4.0|As a dancer since three and aspiring Broadway performer, I was excited to hear that Chicago was going to finally be made into a movie.  Having seen the Broadway revival, I had high expectations for this film.  I was expecting Fosse choreography or at least Fosse inspired choreography.  I got Rob Marshall (who is a choreographer) and loved it.  Completely going away from Fosse choreography was an ingenious idea.  The casting of Zeta-Jones was inspired.  She started out doing Broadway in England and it is obvious.  All you need to see is \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\" to prove that she deserved the Oscar.  People are being hard on Zellwegger.  Remember this though, Roxie is an aspiring Vaudeville performer and not that great.  Yes, in the movie she is picturing all these performances in her head but the certain roughness in her dancing and singing is to be expected.  It adds the charm.  Gere was in Grease on Broadway in the 70s and while it has been a long time coming, he did wonderfully.  His three months work on the tap dance was obvious.  John C. Reilly gave a wonderful performance in Mr. Cellophane.  As for the critics wondering why Lucy Liu and others are in there, it's because everyone wanted to be involved in this project.  The best was Chita Rivera's bit part.  So unexpected.  As for the people who bash Chicago because of Moulin Rouge, get over it.  The two are different ideas.  Both musicals, but if everything looked the same, it would be boring.  Moulin Rouge was shot with interesting camera angles to add to the whimsy of the movie.  Chicago was shot to best show the choreography.  And Nicole Kidman is not a better singer than Zellwegger or Zeta-Jones.  Her voice is too thin.  And I also own Moulin Rouge and love it.  Just don't ask me to pick which is my favorite.
B000069CWE|4.0|Linkin park listened to their gym teachers when they were growing up and obviously remembered them saying \\"Quality over Quantity\\" when they made their albums.  Reanimation however, is an exception to that rule.  It averages at about an hour and completely redefines what a remix album is.  It feels like an entire new experience which is the best thing you can possibly do with a remix album.  It's definately an album you'll want to pick up, but hip hop haters should beware, it does have quite a bit of rap in it.
B000089RVX|2.0|What people don't seem to understand, is the Evanescence are NOT the \\"breath of fresh air\\" everybody thinks they are. They are a label-generated band, with label-generated music, that blatantly rip-off Lacuna Coil (who are one of the best and most talented bands in the world). Amy Lee's vocals are pitch-corrected, which is very obvious to anyone with basic knowledge of recording, and she sings from her throat, which makes everything sound nasaly. It's just annoying. Let's face it, Amy Lee is a 'goth' version of Britney Spears, and is only slightly more talented as a vocalist. If you want to hear real music, written by real musicians, with the most amazing frontwoman ever, listen to Lacuna Coil.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|Straight out of line I can't find a reason to give this album any more then 2 stars.  That song is on the radio every 15 seconds and it grows boring, then annoying within no time at all.  And that's just their single.  I can't imagine what the rest of the album must sound like.  Ick.
B00008CLOA|4.0|I will never understand people who call this a concept album. When I hear Dark Side of the Moon I hear just a bunch of songs that don't really go together at all mixed together with some strange instrumentals and weird sound effects. But when I hear The Wall I hear a concept album in every true sense of the word. Each and every song flows to the next to tell a story of someone being born, going through childhood, rising to fame, and ultimately going insane. You can tell from The Wall that it is telling a story and is definitely qualified to be called a concept album. But ultimately Dark Side of the Moon has no story to tell so is therefore not a concept album. It's just a bunch of songs that were put on an album that don't tell any kind of story at all. The Wall is a concept without a doubt, but Dark Side of the Moon is not.
B00004Z459|4.0|This CD is only 40 minutes long and not too bad but it goes by so fast.  At least it's one of those albums you'll like to listen to again and again.  I can only reccomend it to the crowd who likes replay value over length.
B00008CLOA|4.0|This album is vastly overrated and massively addictive and truthfully is not really a complete album at all. Time towers above all else and the other songs are just supporting players so to speak. One can easily just listen to Time over and over and over again ad nauseum and not even listen to the other tracks whatsoever, and yet Dark Side of the Moon would still serve its purpose and would still be worth owning. Time has never sounded better and is worth everything just to hear this one song alone. The other songs are all good as well and do help to make the album what it is, but if one were to be completely honest with themself they would realize that they have come to buy only Time and not the album as a whole. Sure this album is good, there's no denying that at all, but if Time were the only song on it then it would still be considered a masterpiece by many. Time is The Dark Side of the Moon pure and simple. The rest of the album is just there to make the album longer.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Listen up kids.  If you want music that just destroys anything else ever put onto a cd, buy this as soon as possible.  You may have to listen to it a few times, but once you are sucked in, there is no escape.  Ok Computer is, simply put, the best single album ever.  I know that is a bold statement, but once you start to love this album, you will know exactly what I am talking about.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Much of my time in the Summer of 2000 was invested in searching the treasures of grimy used record shops in old London. I finally found a double issue On the Beach/Time Fades Away in bad condition. I couldn't spend 20 pounds on scratches. Luckily, I did find On the Beach in good condition for the same price by itself. I couldn't be happier that the scarcity of my find has been diminished by the reissue.<br />From the first pounding of Walk On, I was hooked. It sounded more raw than its appearance on the Decade compilation. Ambulance Blues is the most harrowing song, a long &quot;pissing in the wind&quot;. The verses borrow the chord progression of Bert Jansch's Needle of Death, one of his most powerfully sad songs (C - F - Am - Em - D if I remember correctly). For those who haven't heard of him, he is British Folk Guitar Idol to both Neil and Jimmy Page. To Neil's credit, the chorus is much different than Bert's, and equally effective. Neil has a spare violin fill that continues to haunt me, three years after it caught my ear.<br />Sandwiched in between these are more songs of anger and regretful contemplation. If I had to pick out one and say I didn't really like it, I would choose Vampire Blues, because Neil's exhaustion isn't really suited to the rhythm, or perhaps it's the blip in the vinyl. <br />This album can make you miserable. This is catharsis of the highest order. When I'm down, I listen to this and Neil helps me sort it out, even if the pain is closer along the way.<br />I'm picking up the CD after work and can't wait to enjoy it on my commute!
B00005PJ6M|5.0|While Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure was funny, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is simply hilarious.  Of course, the movie is \\"dumb,\\" but it's a comedy classic in my opinion.  This totally triumphant sequel goes all out to entertain, producing a most memorable ending that brings the storyline of both movies together and unifies the past, present, and future of the Bill and Ted universe.  Keanu Reeves is, I believe, at his best and most believable as Ted Theodore Logan, while Alex Winter shows off his impeccable comedic timing as Bill S. Preston, Esq.  I think the wit is a little sharper in this sequel than it was in the original Bill and Ted film, and its closer associations and sometimes impressively subtle references to popular culture should make the comedy more appealing to a wider audience than that attracted to the original movie.<br />As the movie opens, the whole world is Bill's and Ted's oyster.  They have their own apartment, they are in love with the princess babes they rescued from mediaeval England in the first movie, and the Battle of the Bands is all set to take place the following night.  As they already know from Rufus (George Carlin) of the future, their performance at the Battle of the Bands will change the entire world and quickly lead to a blissful future for mankind in which everyone is excellent to each other.  In that happy future, Rufus is teaching a class with the aid of such historical figures as Bach, Edison, and the killer guitar player from Faith No More.  Then, from out of the blue, the classroom is taken over by gunmen led by Rufus' old crotchety gym teacher Chuck De Nomolos.  The man's hatred for Bill and Ted and the way of life they brought into permanent being is so strong that he sends two evil Bill and Ted robots back in time to ruin the lives and future of Wyld Stallyns before they can really even begin.  The robots are pretty successful, actually killing the good Bill and Ted.  Here begins the truly bogus journey of our heroes, as they face the Grim Reaper himself, get an up close and very personal look at the depths of Hell, and journey to heaven to meet God Himself.  It takes more than a well-coordinated Melvin attack on Death to bring them back to life, but they never waver from their determination to come back, save the babes, kill the evil Bill and Ted, and play most triumphantly at the Battle of the Bands.<br />I love the ending of the movie; it has little shame in its pursuit of utter goofiness, and I admire that type of commitment to inanity for the sake of entertainment.  The whole scene takes about fifteen minutes, but the guys put on one heck of a show at the Battle of the Bands.  The fun doesn't even stop when the credits begin to roll because we are treated to a number of magazine and newspaper headlines of the future chronicling the many successes of Bill and Ted and the somewhat troubled rock and roll career of Death.  I love this most non-heinous, totally excellent movie.

B00009UW0N|5.0|This is a favorite film of mine. It works on so many levels. Some of the sequels (2,4,H2O) were good but none of them capture the spookiness and atmosphere John Carpenter and crew captured in 1978. As for the color timing on the transfer, there is NOTHING wrong. I was expecting it to look terrible after some of the things I read. Then I put the disc in and was blown away by what is easlily the best home video presentation of this movie ever. Flesh tones are more accurate and the overall look of the picture is more crisp and vibrant. So I am happy to report that those reports on color timing are either greatly exaggerated or those people need to adjust their sets. One more thing : the audio commentary has been a favorite of mine ever since I first got the Criterion laserdisc around 1994 and now that great commentary can finally be heard by the masses. Enjoy!
0156027321|1.0|This is a very gruesome story which has little to do with God.  It would have been better without the last few chapters.  There is very little mention of religion after the shipwreck.  The book actually deals more with the dark side of man.  Yuck.
B00003CY6M|5.0|This is possibly the most romantic movie I've ever seen. Okay, it's bit far fetched,but the basic premise remains. Do we - or don't we - have that one person with whom we are destined to be with for life? Do some of us follow the signs and end up more or less &amp;amp;amp;quot;happily ever after&amp;amp;amp;quot;? Do some of us ignore the signs and end up searching endlessly for what we've already found? Romantic lead, John Cusack, and fresh-faced, darling Brit, Kate Beckinsale, explore these questions in Serendipity &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;fortunate accident&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;.Only there are no accidents.The movie tells us we HAVE to believe - or we will be lost (at least romantically speaking)for life. If you don't buy this, don't watch Serendipity.
B000002H48|5.0|What an excellent collection of music, and what a performance by many of these artists. I'm overjoyed (but also very sad) to here the late Nicolette Larson perform live on stage.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Screen favorite Bruce Willis became one of the biggiest action stars in the explosive action-packed blockbuster \\"Die Hard\\". While visiting his family in LA, NYC police officer John McClanes (Willis) stumbles into a Christmas party on the top floor of a modern skyscraper. The party quickly turns deadly when a group of terrorists seizes control of the building. Now, using only his wits, McClane declares war on the terrorists who hold his wife hostage. \\"Die Hard\\" is certainly director John McTiernan's best work and ranks as one of the finest action movies ever made. This remarkable actioner contains some tight-paced camera work, a solid storyline, memorable dialogue and some good bits of humor. Bruce Willis delivers plenty of excitement and laughs, and Alan Rickman is positively engaging as the film's villain. The cast also includes Bonnie Bedelia, Paul Gleason, William Atherton and Reginald VelJohnson. \\"Die Hard\\" delivers some memorable thrills and spectacular action sequences including an impressive rooftop explosion.<br /><br />\\"Die Hard\\" Five Star Edition is a remarkable improvement over the previous release. This action-packed movie is presented in a THX approved, 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a stunning and rich video transfer that is cleaner and more enhanced than the previous edition. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is certainly outstanding but for the full home theater experience, the DTS audio track delivers more powerful bass and great clarity. This impressive DVD features in-depth audio commentaries with director John McTiernan and crew, fun outtakes, extended scenes, picture gallery, trailers and colrful interactive menus. With such a remarkable DVD presentation and worthy supplements, \\"Die Hard\\" Five Star Edition is the ultimate Die Hard experience and positively scores an \\"A\\".
B00005A1PR|4.0|I'm not sure on what show my husband and I first heard/saw India Arie.  What I do know is that we were in amazement and hooked instantly.  Incredible voice.  Incredible sound.  She is truly magical.<br />We now have this cd and we love it.  India Arie is so smooth.  What a pleasure it is to be carried away by her fresh soulful voice.<br />India Arie - we look forward to your next album!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|After seeing the movie I found myself playing the score over and over in my head so much that I had to see the movie a second time to hear it with its full orchestration.<br />Fantastic.  I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack CD!
B00005JM09|3.0|\\"Terminator\\" and \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" are two of the all-time classics of science fiction.  Debates rage back and forth over which film was better.  Is it \\"T2\\" with its non-stop juggernaut of action?  Or, is the original \\"Terminator\\" with its suspense, human drama, and fresh story?  The argument will like never be settled.  One question that can be answered, though, is 'Is \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\"' as good as its predecessors.  The answer to that question is definitely 'no'.  \\"Terminator 3\\" is nowhere near as good as the movies that spawned, but, at the same time, it is not a bad movie either.<br /><br />The problems that plague \\"T3\\" may stem from the fact that James Cameron is not directing this time (\\"U-571\\" director Jonathan Mostow helms it this time).  They may also simply stem from the fact that there has been such a long layoff between movies.  \\"Judgment Day\\" came out in 1991, which \\"Rise of the Machines\\" was released this year, 2003.  The novelty has worn off by now.  It also maybe just the simple fact that movie is not much more than a series of protracted actions scenes that seem like they could have been cut from the earlier films.  The movie still manages to garner a positive review because, in its climax, it takes a bold and unexpected turn that shows real audacity and leaves the door open for additional sequels.<br /><br />\\"Rise of the Machines\\" focuses of the life of John Connor (Nick Stahl) in decade or so since the events of \\"Judgment Day\\".  While the destruction of Skynet labs seemed to have put an end to the technology that would have brought about holocaust of Judgment Day, Connor is unable to feel comfortable.  He lives an existence that make him near impossible to trace, fearing the monsters of the future may one day come back for him.  And, like in the previous film, they do.  This time, it's a female Terminator, the T-X (played icily by model Kristanna Loken) who has been sent back to kill Connor and thereby end the threatof the human who can defeat the machines.  In a carbon copy move of the previous film, Arnold Schwarzenneger's Terminator (or a copy of him) is sent back in time to defend Connor from this new threat.  From the point of their arrival, \\"Rise of the Machines\\" becomes nothing more than one long chase scene.  Along the way, Connor and the Terminator pick up an acquaintance from Connor's past, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and they rush to get away from the T-X.  It's important for them to stay alive because it seems that Judgment day was NOT averted, and Connor must live so that the resistance can be led against the Machines.  Connor still believes Judgment Day can be avoided and its a race against time to prevent it.<br /><br />Nick Stahl may not seem like a great choice to play John Connor.  He still seems childish and unimpressive (how are we to believe this man is supposed to lead the resistance?), but then Edward Furlong wasn't exactly an inspired choice to play him in \\"T2\\".  It's nice to see Arnold back in his familiar role.  Though, at times, he seems like a parody of his famous character.  Danes is really just window dressing in her role as Kate Brewster.  She doesn't really contribute much beyond a vast catalog of screams and pained expressions.  Loken's quite a looker as the T-X and is quite menacing, but the role doesn't exactly give her much to act with, so it's hard to evaluate her performance.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Rise of the Machines\\" is a respectable film.  It's not a great one, but it doesn't fail the way other sequels have after long layoffs (\\"Alien: Resurrection\\" to name one).  It's a classic summertime popcorn action movie.  It's also not a bad way to spend 2 hours.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is one of the most satisfying albums I've ever heard, if you examine it on an emotional level.  Right up there with &quot;Blood on the Tracks,&quot; &quot;Achtung Baby,&quot; and &quot;The Boatman's Call.&quot;  There isn't a bad song in the bunch, but my favorites are &quot;In My Place,&quot; &quot;The Scientist,&quot; &quot;Clocks,&quot; and the title track.  &quot;Green Eyes,&quot; a beautiful little love song, is also very good.  Many of the songs are about sadness, lost love, and despair.  Since those are some of my favorite subjects, I'm in heaven when someone steps up to the plate and knocks a song about one or more of those subjects out of the park.  Coldplay does it several times on this album, and I eagerly await their next album.
B000068IEU|4.0|I saw Last House on the Left, after seeing a special on the progression of horror films.  When I found out it was Wes Craven's first film, I had to see it.  The ora of the film is scary enough, it seems as though you are literally there and watching it unfold.  The first minutes are terrifying, all the way to the end.  Although I think that there are attempts at making this film less intense by the introduction of comic conversation, it does not work.  This is thee scariest horror film I have ever seen, because it is &quot;real&quot; and the murder scenes are very hedonistic.  You feel the characters pain, and that makes it so frightening, I would not watch this film alone.  It makes you think twice about trusting a &quot;friendly&quot; stranger. If you are bold, go see this film!!!!
B00005JL78|5.0|I saw this movie originally in the theatres. It was good, although the sound went out during the intial fight &amp; chase scene. But a lot of stuff still didn't make sense to me, and I hate it when actors whisper so utterly low...I have decent hearing but I can't hear that in a crowded theater. I wanted to watch this again at home, with captions on to make sure I didn't miss any dialog. Which is what I would recommend to a lot of the poeple here who are saying that the plot isn't complete and explained...EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED, WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN, THIS TIME PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION. It's actually a very intricate plot, so it can be very easy to miss things.
B000002I8D|5.0|This cd has one of the best songs ever on it. If you are thinking of buying this album you obviously now about in the air of the night. But have you heard the remix with tupac. It is a genera crossing song. If you like rap you have to check this song out. It brings the emotion the song has with the intesinty tupac puts in all of his songs. It is a musical masterpiece.
B000002OZY|5.0|I recevied this album on CD last year as a present. Even though I had heard of the Who I had never heard any of their music besides \\"Pinball Wizard'. <BR>I turned on my stero and immediatly went to Pinball Wizard. I then listened on and heard a song about \\"curing the boy\\". Intrested, I listened on and heard the rocking sounds of \\"Go to the Mirror\\". Amazed, I opened the CD booklet and read about the story of the \\"deaf, dumb and blind kid\\". I went to the beginning of the CD and listened to the entire album.<BR>I was in shock by the end. I followed the entire story and felt Tommy's pain when he was tortured. I felt his sensation when his senses where restored. Finally, I was overwhelmed by \\"Listening to You\\" at the end. <BR>In short, this is the Ultimate rock opera. Any music fan should hear this work of art.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I dismissed the White Stripes as so much hype until I decided to finally see what all the hubbub was about and gave &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; a listen.  That album blew me away as I realized the enormous songwriting and musical ability of Jack &amp; Meg White (who are NOT brother and sister, BTW.)  Jack's wide range of influences is apparent on that album and &quot;Elephant.&quot;<br />There are some truly remarkable tracks on &quot;Elephant&quot; and doubtless &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; is one of them, but overall the album isn't as strong as &quot;White Blood Cells.&quot;  It gives me the impression that they make music to satisfy themselves, which I think is great, but for my taste, this disc falls a tad short.<br />That said, it is still a very fine album and an enjoyable listen.  If you like rock and have a keen sense of humor, this will be right up your alley.
B00008X5J1|3.0|I don't care what no one says, but Martin Scorsese is the greatest American director ever (lots of people agree with me on that one)!! Having said that, I don't think &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; is one of his best films. Its quite messy and his decision to hire Leonardo DiCaprio and Camerion Diaz was a terrible mistake. Also the script is rather uneven. But as always, Martin shines with his direction. But that's the only bright spot in this film. One star for the costumes, one star for history, and one star for the great Martin.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I had very mixed feelings about this film.  I have enjoyed Scorsese's movies over the years but I think in this one there were too many misses and not enough hits. The biggest hit is of course Daniel Day-Lewis, whom I have admired in many other movies. The biggest miss is Leonardo DeCaprio, who I can't stand.  BIG mistake in casting here - he pales next to Day-Lewis. He is just not convincing and I can't really say that I cared about what happened to him.  It's also too bad there wasn't more of Liam Neeson in the movie (now there's a great actor as well).  This movie is definitely worth seeing, but Decaprio's weaknesses take away from the film in a major way.  By the way, Day-Lewis should have gotten the Best Actor Oscar (Hollywood strikes again!) Also, 1 star off for having to change discs to watch the whole movie.
B00009L1TA|4.0|First off I would like to state that despite any flaws this movie contains it is still a joy to watch. John Travolta is excellent in his role, and the rest of the cast plays their parts well enough so that the story doesn't suffer from that aspect. The movie is filmed brilliantly with just the right amount of darkness on the scenes to add that feeling that something is being hidden from you. And it is.<br />This films main problem lies in the fact that you are lead into a dazzling investigation about the deaths of several soldiers on a training mission. You hear sides, you form ideas, and then you realize that none of that even matters. It is that element alone that takes away heavily from this movie. As you travel through this deep and dark military atmosphere in your mind you go through so many twists that you are anticipating this great slam bang ending. It is as that point when you recieve a soft curb in the road that gradually tells you that nothing you've learned on this trip has any bearing on the outcome of the film, and you come face to face with something you saw coming the whole time. <br />I am not saying that this movie completely destroys itself in it's final moments. It doesn't exactly leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, just a feeling that your candy has lost some of it's flavor. All in all this is a very enjoyable film, that fails to deliver that final knockout punch you were waiting for...
B000099T2L|4.0|Well personally I am a fan of both.. I really liked this album. I heard everything from it was wack to I liked it a lot. So I decided to go get it myself and make my own judgement. I stay in Japan currently so I got a bonus track to up ya'll on.. It's called What's it Gonna Be... to the music of the hip hop version of Wonder if heaven got a ghetto...2PAC  It's a tight track..whoo I love buying music in foreign countires, they not stingy with the trax... Anyway back to B, Yes I think the album was hot, she proved that she shines more than the other members of DC however to whomever made the comment about sistah girl not becoming a legend, i think she has already done that...truly. Love the album buy it.. and by the way my favorite song on there is Speechless. And for the person who doesn't know what Gift from Virgo is about.. let me drop something for ya... it's a jazzy felt song thats all, and its about falling in love with someone. Listen dang!!! We Virgos rule, if you don't think so looks who's on top...hehe holla!
B000002VCB|4.0|This fourth album by Alan Parsons explores the concept of women from many different points of view and states of mind. This is one of the least favourites for the own Parsons but that doesn't mean it's not as good as other albums. The overall feel of an adult and serious album can make the first listens a little bit dull, but after a while you'll discover the cleverness and the accuracy of arrangements, words and performance.<br /><br />The opening theme, Lucifer, is an ovbious classic and gets dozens of cover versions from 'Synthesiser' CDs. Its intense rythm and the scary opening make it a very interesting song... and it's very ironic that the album based in the concept of women opens with a song such called. 'You Lie Down With Dogs' is that kind of song sung by Zakatek describing the problems of a relationship... just seems the continuing story of 'I Wouldn't Want o Be Like You', in fact that phrase is said at the end of the song. 'I'd Rather Be A Man' is another song with a load of mysoghinia that adds very psychedelic sequencers and a very nice drum rythm that will be repeated at 'Secret Garden'. 'Winding Me Up' is nicely sung by Chris Rainbow and contents a grand orchestral arrangement giving it a very baroque feel.<br /><br />'damned if I Do' is undoubtedly the best vocal song of the album, with a very nice opening melody that has certain medieval feel. Lenny Zakatek sings in a very passionate feel and the guitarist Ian Bairnson plays a great and well developed guitar solo, keeping the awesome work he does over the whole record. 'Don't Hold Back' is more disposable, sounds a little far from any other Project song and the words look like taken from a cheap self-help book. 'Secret Garden' is my favourite from the album, that driving drum beat and the elegant and clever chorused piano have a sense of adventure enhaced by the orchestra. Then the pace changes and a magic vapor atmosphere appears with some \\"doobie-doobie-doo\\" voices not exent of humour... a guitar plays a cycling solo and with a quick drum bridge we appear again into the main melody. This is a very underrated instrumental wich I think is one of the best if not one of the most famous. The album appears with a classic Project ballad, this time well sung by the delicate voice of Leslie Duncan. A dramatic and beautiful repeating solo from Ian Bairnson sets end to this record. Not one of the best from Alan Parsons Project, but still a must hear for anybody interested in the band, for the high quality of arrangements, the great work of Ian Bairnson, and great songs like 'Damned If I Do', 'Secret Garden' or 'Winding Me Up'. And adult album as well.solo and with a quick drum bridge we appear again into the main melody. This is a very underrated instrumental wich I think is one of the best if not one of the most famous.

0792833236|5.0|The Academy Awards voters once again dropped the ball, by not honoring this movie as &quot;Best Picture&quot; and by not givng Martin Scorsese &quot;Best Director&quot;. At least Robert DeNiro won &quot;Best Actor&quot;. Not only does this movie stand the test of time, but its considered the greatest movie of the 80s (which I have to agree). Even though this movie was done in black and white and is quite violent, I really enjoyed the story. The production, writing, acting, and oh yes, the direction are all top notch GOLD!! This movie is the reason why I no longer respect the Academy Awards anymore, because they don't honor the right people. In closing, why is this movie no longer available????!!!!!
0385504209|3.0|I have to agree with some of the negative reviews.  If you are familiar with goddess and grail traditions, there is nothing new here.  Same for some of the Da Vinci material.  The Priory of Sion was absorbed into the Jesuits in the 15th century, but Brown made excellent fictional hay out of its real-life 20th century reincarnation in pre-war France.  All of that is eminently forgivable if it weren't for the woefully underdeveloped lead characters. They are supposed to be experts in their fields, however, I, a dilettante, solved nearly every clue rather quickly (I am not that smart, the clues were just that obvious.)  It was torturous to wait while our heroes - who should have known this material - went through some painfuly dullwitted exercises to solve the mysteries.  So, if this stuff is new to you - you'll probably like it.  If you are reading it because you heard it was about goddess traditions and the sacred feminine - pass.  But to end this review with a kiss,(because I appreciate the colossal effort it takes to write a novel) I did enjoy the ending.  It's rather a corker!

B0000BWVCJ|5.0|X-2 does a great job of continuing the story from the first X-men. The title \\"X-men United\\" kind of threw me when I first saw it, but once you see the movie it all makes sense (don't want to give away anything.)

0788811355|1.0|The English Patient won best picture in 1996.  And I do not understand why.  Maybe, such as was the case with Titanic, it was such a bad year in movies they had to give it to some romance film.  Naturally, the only ones who like it are intellectual critics, not every day people who want to see a MOVIE.  This was a soap opera turned super long movie that failed to produce any interest or quality or substance to the viewers.<br />Although I liked the period and setting the film was in, the plot is so stereotypical and predictable and dis-interesting, it ruins the film.  A guy falls in love and gets involved with a married woman.  Now, how many movies have this as their main theme?  Hundreds.  Originality in this movie is non existant.<br />First of all, why do we want to see a movie about some English jerk, who isn't a very likeable guy in this movie, who has an affair with this woman during WWII?  I mean already the plot is redundant, but the characters are blaw, they aren't enjoyable to watch or understand, they are difficult characters who are cold and distant.<br />Naturally, there is no suspense in the romance of this film, because before you know it, the two main characters (Fiennes and Thomas) are tearing each other's clothes off and bathing naked together in a tub.  Gee, how romantic.  Is this really romance or just sex?  Why couldn't Thomas' character play a little harder to get instead of being so easily willing to share her body with this jerk?  It's almost as if the objective of this film was to create instant passion between the characters by making them have sex all the time, practically every time they meet.  There is a lot more to romance than that, or at least there should be.<br />This film, not to mention, is horribly boring.  Takes forever to get the plot to move along, you can't stand any of the characters, nothing makes this film memorable but the sex scenes.<br />In short, the sex ruins the film because it turns this story into a stereotypical, modern romance.  It can't be original with its theme, no it has to borrow a redundant theme and just add sex to it.  And presto!  It wins an academy award.<br />If you don't mind redundant themes, romance that includes too much sex, and unenjoyable characters then you will like this film.  Me on the other hand, appreciate originality with the romance and plot.  These films, such as this one, that get academy awards for best picture is exactly why I don't watch the oscars anymore., modern romance.

B00009P1O0|4.0|I remember when I first heard this album upon its release when I was back in high school.  I was kind of dissapointed, it didn't sound like Everybody Knows, Gold Rush or Harvest.  I'm sure glad it doesnt sound like those albums now.  One of Neil's lasting attractions is the fact that he'll always surprise you.  With a little time these surprises become fine gems.  <br />There are some true gems here.  &quot;See the Sky About To Rain&quot; is a beautiful lyrical poem.  &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; a fantastic tounge-in-cheek parody  of life in the urban indulgence of southern CA.  &quot;For the Turnstiles&quot; continues Neil's perspective of the music industry.  Then there's the second side.  You begin to get lost in the morass of  depression when the album suddenly ends with &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot;  This is perhaps one of Neil's finest songs, yet often overlooked.  He sings longingly of days gone by and the state of lost naivete, an end to the hippie dream.  Thankfully for Neil, this dark period was over in a couple of years, but with this album and &quot;Tonights the Night&quot; his dark period has left us with some great music .
B0000AC8N4|5.0|This session is a meeting between three of the most influential musicians of the forties (Dexter, Bud Powell and Kenny Clarke as &quot;Americans in Paris&quot;), completed by the great french bassist Pierre Michelot. At this really happy date the musicians decided to play tunes, that go back to the time, when those guys first  gigged and recorded together, like Parkers &quot;Scrapple from the Apple&quot;. But especially about Dexters playing it can be said, that he had modified his style during the sixties, absorbing ideas from musicians, who originally had been influenced by him (listen to some very Coltrane-ish licks on &quot;Night in Tunisia&quot;). Actually, Dexter once stated, that he was thrilled by that kind of mutual exchange of ideas: First he had been a main source of influence for the early John Coltrane and later, especially during the time of this recordings (1963), Dexter further developed his style using some of Coltranes ideas. Besides the above mentioned faster tunes, I expecially like &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot; with its nice intro and that kind of blues-feeling and of course the beautiful ballad &quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot;. Bud Powell, almost at the end of his career, still plays very inspired. Expecially during those years in Paris, Bud was at his best on encounters with other great Americans, who visited Europe or temporarly lived there.
B000050IE6|5.0|Its hard to define what Opeth sounds like. You have to hear them. I feel that no matter what type of music you like, you can find one element about this band that you would like. <br />This entire album is great, and its hard to single out the best. \\"The Moor\\" is the first track and what an opener it is. As the main character rises from his slumber/grave he sees all the pain around him and wants his love, Melinda, back. <br />\\"..Lament\\" is a grand track, also. It starts with a brutal riff. And actually descends to a beautiful (dare I say Christian?) riff in which you can feel every emotion the character goes through. <br />\\"Benighted\\" is a acoustic track. And gives the user a break from the grinding riffs and laments on the characters past. <br />\\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\" really displays what this band can do with its wide range of taste, and aesthetics. <br />\\"Face of Melinda\\" is a great track and once again, depicts many emotions throughout its course. More background is given on the characters dilemma, and I'm ashamed that I can't think of anything better, because this is a great track. <br />\\"Serenity Painted Death\\" is one of the reasons I bought the album. With its insanely catchy guitar riffs, and terrifying vocals (\\"White face, hagard grin, Serenity Painted Death,\\") this is the climax of the album. As is \\"White Cluster\\" which depicts the downfall of the hero (or villian), but not without amazing you with its blend of anger and remorse for the lost loved one.<br />All in all, this is a great album. With only 7 tracks you may think its a little weak on substance. NOT TRUE! This album is grand and it improves with multiple listenings. You know you really appreciate it when you can listen to an 11 minute track while thinking its only 4 minutes long. <br />Take some time. Buy this album. And understand what good metal is.
B00006X06U|5.0|Joni Mitchell has provided us with amazing music for decades. But this album is among the best CDs I've ever heard. Her music is reinvented by the amazing arrangements and voice is as good as ever. 5 star plus!
6302886228|5.0|This is a great show with some classic performances by Neil Young, Lou Reed, Willie Nelson, Johnny Winter, Tom Petty and the late great George Harrison.  I want to add my name to the petition to get this released on DVD.  I'll pre-order it ASAP!
B000002UZ1|1.0|I tried, I really tried to like the Beatles.  Bu I must be too young.<br />Don't hurt me, but I think Avril Lavigne is a hundred times better.<br />Were the Beatles original?  I don't believe so, their music is so trite.  So copied.
B000000WFF|5.0|By the time this album came out, the Spice Girls were everywhere. They were on every magazine cover, they were on lollipops, books, they even had several series of dolls as well as 5 #1 hit songs. This album only added to it & to this day has sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Face it, they sold more records than anyone since the Beatles & no one has yet to sell more than the Spice Girls did. They are a landmark in pop music, a legacy & without them, there would be no Britney or Christina.<br />01. Spice Up Your Life (10/10)<br />Yet another #1 hit for the girls, this song has great lyrics. And it was a clever way of marketing them. I was impressed by the video, it is very good. Great song.<br />02. Stop (10/10)<br />The one song that didn't reach #1 in the UK. I love this one. Geri's vocals are in my opinion the best part of this song. She sounds so sweet & perfect in her verses. Catchy lyrics...a perfect pop song.<br />03. Too Much (10/10)<br />One of my fav songs by them of all time. Just like 2 Become 1. I love the message & story behind this one. When you have it, it's too much...when you don't, it's not enough. GREAT lyrics.<br />04. Saturday Night Divas (10/10)<br />Another favorite of mine. I love Melanie C's part in the bridge. Her voice here amazes me. Emma's verses are also perfect. Nice song with original, different verses. Love it!<br />05. Never Give Up On The Good Times (10/10)<br />Alot of fans agree this would have been a great single. This is a great song with a great message to everyone. Especially to the girls. Be safe & don't get pregnant...live young while you can.<br />06. Move Over (8/10)<br />The Pepsi song, but it's great overall. Kind of a filler on this album, but its smooth rythm and raw vocals make up for it. Although I prefer the other Pepsi song \\"Step To Me\\" over this one. It is available on the Japanese version of this album.<br />07. Do It (9/10)<br />Another song with a great message! My mom didn't think so when this album first came out, but I agreed with everything they are saying & I still do. \\"Rules are meant to be broken, do what suites you, not what they want you to do.\\"<br />08. Denying (10/10)<br />Reminds me of my ex boyfriend denying he was actually gay. This is one of my favorites. \\"You ain't foolin nobody but yourself.\\" So true.<br />09. Viva Forever (10/10)<br />Gorgeous! Beautiful lyrics & melody. Saying goodbye to true love...I can relate to this deeper than alot of the other songs here. This song actually gives me chills, it's a haunting song. One of their best.<br />10. The Lady Is A Vamp (7/10)<br />Not one of my favorites, but it IS different. And it's a great way to end the album just like a concert...\\"Ladies and gentlemen, we hope that you enjoyed the show!\\"<br />Overall this album is just as good as the original with just as much spice as the last. Geri, Emma, Mel C, Mel B & Victoria all have equal vocals on this one & they all sound amazing nonetheless. Actually this album is probably my favorite out of all three, and I do LOVE all three. So if you don't have this already, buy it used or something. It is fun. It makes you dance, cry & think alot. Not just a soundtrack, this is an ALBUM. Get it!t I agreed with everything they are saying & I still do. \\"Rules are meant to be broken, do what suites you, not what they want you to do.\\"<br />08.

B00006L9ZT|3.0|Traditional staging and rather blah.  More interesting staging has been tried in the Chereau/Boulez Industrial Revolution &quot;Ring&quot;  and the Barenboim laser-light show.  But what makes Wagner are the performances, and the Met usually commands the finest.  But after seeing Jeannine Altmeyer and Peter Hofmann (Sieglinde &amp; Siegmund) in the steamy, nearly R-rated Chereau &quot;Walkure&quot;, Jessye Norman's Sieglinde looks kind of ridiculous.  This is no comment on her singing.  She probably does great on record, and probably pulls it off on stage.  What the Met needed to do was scrounge up a young-Isola-Jones type.  No doubt the Met wanted to trot out some of its finest players for so massive an undertaking as the &quot;Ring&quot;, but it leaves one scratching one's head about Siegmund's immediate attraction.  I've often defended opera as the most democratic of media -- it doesn't matter how old you are, how fat you are, or the color of your skin;  only the quality of one's voice matters.  I may have to revise this thinking with the availability of dvd.<br />For a workmanlike &quot;Ring&quot; that doesn't challenge, this one's fine.  James Morris, a long-time favorite of mine (his &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; made me an opera fan way back in the '70s) is a good Wotan, and from his entrance he carries the show admirably.  Heinz Zednik (one of several carry-overs from the Chereau version) is a Mime who is both funny and pitiable.  The rest of the cast is as good as the Met makes them.<br />For for a &quot;Ring&quot; that is more intellecutally and emotionally challenging, try to Chereau version.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|A weird, bluesy, conceptual freight train of an album.  Halfway through listening to the songs, it occured to me that I really cared about these characters, characters laid out very plainly by Young's trembling falsetto.  I guess the whole point of a review is to tell you if the album is worth your cash, so here it is:  It's worth it.
B000002UAU|1.0|I was born after the Beatles had long been disbanded.<br />They music, is well, I Don't get it.<br />Maybe at the time it was good, but it is 2003, and they suck.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|After the hardly passionate \\"Are You Passionate\\" comes this dispassionately ironic (and paradoxically much more passionate) \\"Greendale.\\"  By all means buy this album and buy it while the bonus CD is still part of the package.  I was introduced to \\"Greendale\\" this past summer when Neil & Crazy Horse visited Atlanta.  Atlanta audiences at Chastain Park were privy only to the stripped down version of what was apparently a multimedia extravaganza in other venues, but the completely stripped down version of \\"Greendale\\" solo acoustic on the bonus DVD is perhaps the way Young's loose rock narrative should really be experienced.  Ultimately the Crazy Horse version on the CD (inexplicably minus Frank Sampedro) is a welcome gloss on the acoustic version.<br />Pay no attention to critics who badmouth this set.  Young's wry commentary shows you he not only does he have a sense of irony, but it's a subtle irony, too.  <br />I won't claim this is a masterpiece (that honor belongs to \\"Tonight's the Night\\"), but it's thoughtful, meditative and rocking all at once.  It has been a Neil Young day at my house today as the reissues of 4 of the missing 6 have competed with this new release for carousel time.  Especially for long time Neil Young fans, \\"Greendale\\" holds its own and then some.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|A lot of people have been saying that the Matrix Reloaded was a bad movie and ruined the Matrix series. I think that the Matrix Reloaded is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I liked it more than the first movie. I saw this movie twice in the theaters, and i was amazed both times. This movie had mind blowing action scenes and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Yes the orgy scene in the beggening of the movie was mest up, but overall this movie was great. I don't understand how people say this movie has no story line at all when their are so many twists and turns in the storyline. It also leaves you with a cliff hanging of an ending that guarentees a great third matrix movie. Everyone, not only matrix fans should own this movie!!!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|For 35 years, Neil Young has been an iconic figure in the music industry, and even a condensed summary of his work would never fit this space. That's ok, because the only thing you need to know about &quot;Greendale&quot; is that it's one of the best albums he's ever released, and you should own it. Supported by his long-time backing band Crazy Horse, Neil delivers a truly different album compared to his other works. Namely, this album would fit some people's definition of a &quot;concept&quot; album. Don't worry - This in no way detracts from the amazing quality of these songs. The tracks on Greendale are musical renditions of the chapters in a story that Neil wrote, about a fictional town on the California coast and a family who live there, named, appropriately enough, the Green family. There is a clear middle, beginning, and end to the story, and throughout the album, Neil's lyrics deliver a cutting commentary on many of the most controversial topics of our time - The Media, Politics, Family, and the Environmental movement. From the beginning of the first song, where he humorously comments on the length of his own career, to the last notes of the closing song, in which the call to action is delivered as clearly as the Alaskan sky, Neil Young clearly states that he has a few things to say, and he's going to take his time saying them. This is no 3-minute apiece tune fest - The average song length here is almost 8 minutes, and there isn't a dull moment in the lot. For anyone who likes classic rock, electric blues, or the wonderfully unique way Neil Young has of strangling memorable riffs and catchy solos from his guitar, this album is a must-have. Heck, this album is a must-have, period.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot's debut album is the most gut wrenching, heart pounding metal album in the last 5 years.  Slipknot's mix of distorted guitars, pounding percussionists, a genius double bass drummer, bassist, DJ, sampler, is one of a kind.  No other band ever assembled can top Slipknot's sound of chaotic maddness.  Also, one of the best live performances.
0060920084|5.0|This book is a collection of stories about Bryson's trip around the country in search for the perfect small town, which calls &quot;Amalgam&quot;. It begins with a hilarious take on the Midwest (most notably Iowa, his home State) and stories from the family vacations of his youth. It is a travel book, and not intended as great literature, but it is truly laugh out loud funny.  It is, I believe, a fair indictment of certain aspects of out society as reflected in the author's travels. A little caustic (think on the road with David Letterman), but really, really funny.
B000002WU9|5.0|Who ever mounty323 is, has no idea about hip-hop music. How can you take one of the greatest albums ever released and come with it's \\"[average at best], [over hyped]\\". Whoever you are you need to recognize that this is rap in its purest form. The obvious thought that comes to mind is that you like west coast hip-hop, but I'm a hip-hop junky born and raised in L.A. & this album is mind-boggling. Don't dis what you have no idea about, sucka.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|In taking a journey with Neil Young through Greendale, you'll conclude that the story line isn't particularly unique. But the lyrics to these ten songs are stunning, even for one of rock's legendary songwriters. Only Neil can share the deeper, layered meanings contained in these songs but even taken at face value, it's great entertainment. Crazy Horse provides its typical funky blues punch and Young's voice is in great form. The bonus DVD is required viewing, perhaps before listening to the CD, because Young provides some insight into Greendale and the lyrics are more easily understood (and appreciated) than on the CD.  Greendale should rank high in an already crowded field of &quot;the best of&quot; Neil Young albums.
B00009UW0N|1.0|Buyer Beware! This edition is hideous. The extras are good, but the actual film has been butchered. The colors are all wrong.. I could go on & on. Anchor Bay should just re-release the 2 disc special edition & be done with it! Stay away from this one-- try the previous edition instead.
006092988X|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time.  I first read this book over twenty years ago and to this day, I think about the characters often, comparing their struggles to those I have experienced in my own life.  I recommend this book to anyone who will listen.  If this book touches you the way it has touched me, it will stay with you forever.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not particularly a big fan of &quot;Death&quot; metal.  I prefer heavy music with SINGING, as opposed to the growling that bands like Opeth are known for.  BUT, I heard about Opeth in a chat room, and decided to sample a few songs from &quot;Damnation&quot;.  After hearing &quot;Death Whispered A Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Closure&quot; and &quot;Weakness&quot;, I knew I HAD to have this album.  Now I've listened to the whole thing several times, and I have to say that this is one of the most intriguing, hauntingly beautiful albums I have ever heard.  This band's unbelievably incredible musicianship shines through in every single song.  It's obvious that these guys take their craft VERY seriously, and work very hard to be the top-shelf musicians that they are.  Tbe next time someone tries to tell me that metal peformers aren't good musicians, I'll pull out this album and prove them very wrong!  A MUST HAVE for true music fans.
B00006HBUA|5.0|Generally I think this is an awesome movie in any way, as well as it's DVD. In fact before seeing this movie I hadn't watched any Scooby cartoons yet, at least I don't remember I had. So now I'm writing my review on the movie itself, not on the comparision between the movie and it's cartoon version, which I think is not really that necessary. And I'd have to say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen these years. I've watched the DVD over and over again, probably more than five times and sometimes with the commentary on. And I just couldn't put it down! First of all, The storyline is smooth and easy to get into. There's not a moment I don't enjoy. Everything in this movie look bright and colorful, so do the characters. Second, the four actors who play the four main characters in the movie sure did a good job. They bring out every character's personalities and everything through their acting. And it's almost obvious at the beginng of the movie, so it's very easy to figure out their relationship and what kind of people they are like even though you're people like me who aren't familiar with scooby-doo. Also, the interaction and conflicts between these people make this movie even more funny and interesting, Personally Scooby-Doo and Velma are my favortie characters, and I think they did very well on the movie version of Scooby. He looks kind of like a real dog instead of cartoon version, but at the same he is so funny, active and full of emotions. There're one or two scenes of his eyes watering. To me that is just so moving! At this point I almost forgot that he is created with computer animation! Finally, the ending is quite encourging and satisfying. It leaves me wonderful memories after the movie ends. By the way, this is one of the well-done DVDs too. It includes great special features such as cast and director's commentaries, they did help me understand the movie better. All in all, I think this movie is definitely worth seeing and the DVD is unquestionablya must own!!
0140177396|4.0|This popular high school or college required reading written by Steinbeck was one book I have never read. Neither have I watched the movie (1940) or newer versions (1981, 1992). What intrigues me is ALA has listed the novel as top sixth 100 banned books during 1990-1999.  How can popular novels written by a famous author who earned a Presidential Metal of Freedom in 1964 received banned and challenged review years after initial publication? Perhaps it was a typo until I confirmed:    \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was banned:  Syracuse, Indiana, 1974;  Oil City, Pennsylvania, 1977;  Grand Blanc, Michigan, 1979;  Continental, Ohio, 1980  Skyline High School, Scottsboro, Alabama, 1983.    The book was challenged:   Greenville, South Carolina, 1977;  Vernon-Verona-Sherill, NY, School District, 1980;  St. David, Arizona, 1981;  Telly City, Indiana, 1982;  Knoxville, Tennessee, School Board, 1984    Steinbeck wrote the novel at his house in Los Gatos back in 1937. It was an era of depression; migrant workers and poverty persisted in the US. Steinbeck had dropped out of Stanford earlier to work on the Sprechels Sugar Ranch in this area as a farm hand. He observed the workers behavior and wrote about them. They represented low education and economically poorly people who would do anything to survive. He accurately described the way things were with no flowerily words.     The plot of the novel was quite simple.    George Mitton (witty, small) and Lennie Small (big man with small brain) both dreamed of acquiring a little land of their own someday. They also were in need of each other. This was in the middle of the depression years among many poor migrant workers searched for work.  As low social class they got no respect in the society. Steinbeck showed his sympathy and concern for the down trodden the way we are concerned with homeless and jobless today.    Paired with both accusations and past accidents these two went to work at a Ranch. It was there the readers were introduced to some interesting characters, all seemed to evolve around rancher's son Curley. Curley is the bully, always ready to pick on those weaker people, but was an insured failure in a big way. He failed to be a respected boss #2, husband, and a man. His wife (name never mentioned) knew what was missing in life. She tried to get Lannie's attention in taking her. It led to her accidental death. There in the barn among the dark, dank smell of hay the one event after another began to unravel.      The end of the novel was worth contemplation and debate. Lennie Small hid in the brush and awaited his frightful punishment. George Mitton had to make a decision; he took matters into his own hands by ending Small's life. The tragic ending could have been averted. Some writers sometimes believe the ending of a novel to provide vicarious happy endings especially targeted for youth. Steinbeck ended it as a tragedy.    Could in the novel George Mitton run away in the novel from the crime scene with the woman? Would George have waited for justice to be meted out by a bunch of gun carrying migrant workers who were ready to shoot Lennie?  To some readers true literary tragedy is distasteful. This may be one of the reasons that the novel was challenged by many parents if not banned?     I thought Steinbeck experimented with novel structured like a play. He believed the writer's duty and served as watchdog of society. To satirize its silliness, to attack its injustices, to stigmatize its faults. He achieved this goal remarkably well in this novel. In fact the book was in the form of a play (1937) and ended as an opera (1970).     In retrospect, throughout the novel there were words or vernaculars of improper conduct, vulgar language, presentation of low social class characters which can be objectionable to YA or their parents. I list some examples found from the six chapters including but not limited to:     1.Live off the fatta the lan', 2. Bustin' a gut, 3. Cat house, 4. Health issues like pants rabbits, 5. Shove out of here, 6. What the hell's he got on his shoulder, 7. Crack and flop, 8. Goo-goos.    The urge to control other's lives and restrict what they can read appears to be just below the surface. People may deny that they want to censor books and mouth platitudes about appropriate reading material, but the end results are challenges to books in schools and libraries.     I would hesitate recommending this book at junior high or grade school. Outstanding novel like Of Mice and Men rises just above the safety threhold and basic functional reading to which some teachers or adults would restrict youth to read. As for YA a novel teaches much more than the mechanics of reading, the vernaculars used actually helps to stimulate critical thinking skills. As teenagers they are old enough to discuss and debate the meanings of the vulgar language as it applies today. For college age patrons, they are old enough to vote and fight for America they should be allowed to read as they please.
0688163173|5.0|i don't know where to start. I am a faithful Lehane devotee and i must admit that this book was such a stretch for him as a writer that it would have been either a total disaster or a work of genius. I am glad to announce that it was definately the latter!! What an ending!  I can't really say that i got it completely but Lehane certainly managed to keep me up all night wondering how he managed to fool me so easily! I can't recommend this book highly enough!

In fact, the book was in the form of a play (1937) and ended as an opera (1970).<br />In retrospect, throughout the novel there were words or vernaculars of improper conduct, vulgar language, presentation of low social class characters which can be objectionable to YA or their parents. I list some examples found from the six chapters including but not limited to:<br />1.Live off the fatta the lan', 2. Bustin' a gut, 3. Cat house, 4. Health issues like pants rabbits, 5. Shove out of here, 6. What the hell's he got on his shoulder, 7. Crack and flop, 8. Goo-goos.<br />The urge to control other's lives and restrict what they can read appears to be just below the surface. People may deny that they want to censor books and mouth platitudes about appropriate reading material, but the end results are challenges to books in schools and libraries.<br />I would hesitate recommending this book at junior high or grade school. As for YA a novel teaches more than the mechanics of reading, the vernaculars used actually helps to stimulate critical thinking skills. As teenagers they are old enough to discuss and debate the meanings of the vulgar language as it applies today. For college age patrons, they are old enough to vote and fight for America they should be allowed to read as they please.<br />This is a good book to read and to comtemplate.der, 7.

B00005MP58|5.0|I'm usually very hesitant about adaptations from book to film (especially classics), but this movie does justice to Jane Austin's timeless masterpiece.  I rented this movie on a whim, thinking that it would at least be somewhat entertaining, but to my surprize and great pleasure, it not only captivated the true essence of the novel but the characters really came alive and stayed true to the story the whole way through.  I eventually bought the DVD and I have NOT had &quot;buyer's remorse&quot; ever since. I get caught up in every moment of every scene of every viewing.<br />  There are no annoying &quot;Hollywood stars&quot; in it like in Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, yet the acting is incredible. Although I enjoyed Sense and Sensibility (on the second viewing because the first time I watched it I fell asleep), it doesn't hold a candle to Pride and Prejudice.  This adaption lets your imagination steep in the imagery, language, and essence of the film so you never get &quot;pulled out&quot; of a scence. If you're unsure as whether or not to buy this gem, just do what I did and rent it for the weekend.  You'll soon discover that your movie collection will be lacking without this rendition of Pride and Prejudice.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|Possibly because only one single, &quot;So This Is Love,&quot; was released from it, &quot;Fair Warning&quot; was the lowest-selling and least popular of Van Halen's first six efforts. But NEVER judge an album by sales alone.<br />&quot;Fair Warning,&quot; although it is barely more than half an hour in length, features some of the deepest and most complex work Van Halen ever produced. It's often considered the band's darkest record, but those people are forgetting about the toe-tapping party smash &quot;Unchained,&quot; which just might be the best song from the band's David Lee Roth era.<br />&quot;Mean Street&quot; opens the record with a guitar solo that is virtually impossible for anyone other than Eddie Van Halen to play, and the song's main guitar hook is standard, top-of-the-line EVH material. &quot;Dirty Movies&quot; is a slow, mellower song that happens to be about exactly what the title implies. &quot;Sinner's Swing,&quot; a fast, upbeat rocker that's completely opposite from the two tracks sandwiching it, contains DLR's first recorded F-word! &quot;Hear About It Later&quot; is much like track two, with the same laid-back style, yet it still retains that good ol' classic Van Halen shine.<br />&quot;Unchained&quot; speaks for itself, and should be reason enough to buy the album. &quot;Push Comes to Shove&quot; (which features a catchy opening bass hook) and &quot;So This Is Love&quot; are a pair of good-but-not-awesome songs, one slow, the other fast. The intrumental bit &quot;Sunday Afternoon in the Park&quot; goes together with the album closer, &quot;One Foot out the Door.&quot; Both tracks have backing music from Eddie's synthesizer - the infamous synthesizer that was ever-present on the last DLR record, 1984.<br />Sure, the album may be short, but that doesn't stop it from being great. No matter how many more rock albums come and go in the future, &quot;Fair Warning&quot; should not be neglected.
B00005JLEU|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Miyazaki. MONONOKE HIME is one of my favorites, and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is an infectiously magical romp that makes you feel like a wide eyed five year old. The ingredients are all in this one: fantastic creatures, a believable heroine, moments (particularly on the train) of pure magic, and Joe Hisaishi's excellent-as-always score. It's just that the never ending army of supernatural beings gets tiresome after a while. Definitely worth seeing, but not as good as everyone says, and certainly no MONONOKE.
B00008NRI8|3.0|From the first 5 minutes you know that this is probably another soft comedy that would not win any prizes. Yet the movie runs smoothly, it is entertaining and would make you spend almost 100 minutes of your time pleasantly. Grant and Bullock match well, Grant throws some good lines of british-dressed humor that will make you crack a lot of smiles - no big laughs though. A home movie you can watch over in time.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD!  It has spurred me to haul out my violin after about 12 years of not touching it.  I play the entire CD on a daily basis!  I listen to it over and over (much to my husband's dismay!  He's tired of it!)  If I were in the LA area I'd be begging to play in the next movie orchestra!  My 9 year old son and I quote the movie within as many songs as we are able.  Songs 14 and 15 have me crying.  This is simply the most beautiful music I have on CD and anticipate needing to purchase a second one because I'll wear out the first one!<BR>Thank You Klaus Badelt for a WONDERFUL score!
B000002JNG|4.0|It's hard to rate Robert Plant's albums generally. After a period of trial and error and experimentation - Plant generally settled into a more mainstream groove by this album, continuing his success from Now &amp; Zen.<br />His partnership with Phil Johnstone showcases a snazzier cooler Plant sound, making Manic Nirvana among his best produced albums.<br />The standout tracks are Tie Die on the Highway; Anniversary; Ma Said You Cried in Your Sleep Last Night; Liars Dance and the majestic Watching You.  All the classic Zep overtures are embedded in these tracks, and they are refreshing to hear.<br />The album's first few tracks are more along standard monster rock riffs and the late 80s kinda stuff.  They're well done but not particularly expressive.<br />The album is worth getting for the last few tracks - otherwise wait for Plant's retrospective...In perspective - it's a real shame that Plant didn't get stick with the same band longer - I think more could have been achieved.
6302610702|5.0|The Godfather Trilogy is perhaps the greatest film achievement in history. Unlike so many past classics, it does not age, and is still relevant to tadoy's youth.<br />Part 1 is my favourite of the collection, and is only made what it is by Marlon Brando. He is everything you expect of a Mafioso, charming and powerful, yet cold and deadly. As Don Vito Corleone, Brando makes the role his own and lifts this movie to unimaginable heights. <BR>Al Pacino as Michael the All-American war hero turned killer is also wonderful, and The Godfather is just a taste of what is to come.<br />Part 2 portrays Michael and a younger Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) at the same age, both trying to cement positions in the underworld. De Niro's performance in this movie is captivating, and it is the first time I have been so intensely drawn in by a character whose dialogue is in a foreign language. It is a true skill to be able to draw an audience in when they are reading your words at the same time, and I now have the utmost respect for Robert De Niro. <BR>Part 2 has a much deeper emotional feeling, as Michael Corleone struggles to live up to his father's impeccable reputation. Very different to Part1, but just as high quality.<br />I have read mixed reviews for Part 3, many saying it was a cheap attempt at cashing in, but after watching the movie to see the Godfather's conclusion I have to disagree.<BR>In Part 3, Michael has grown old, and is determined to clear the Corleone name before he dies. Battling diabetes, he looks to his son to be his successor, but after his offer is turned down, he looks to Vincent Mancini to take the ranes.<BR>Vincent, played by Andy Garcia, is a short-tempered Italian trying to make it as a gangster, but Michael tries to teach him how things work when you're in &quot;the family&quot;. Garcia is perfectly cast, and shows both sides of Vincent wonderfully.<BR>A fitting conclusion to the masterful trilogy, Part 3 is every bit as good as the first two films.<br />The Godfather Collection is a film-lover's dream, and is a necessary part of any video library.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This cd rocks plain and simple. The singers voice may take a little getting used to but the music is insane. Punky and yet proggy at the same time. Lyrics are emotional and gut wrenching.Guitar playing is cutting edge.<br />The first 3 songs will definitely hook you but the entire disc is great. Buy it and give it a shot. You won't regret it.

B00006IU73|5.0|This is a great cd but 2 songs (&quot;Blackest Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Musak&quot;) are two of the best I've heard in a while by anyone.<br />If you get this you won't be disappointed. Great song writing and stellar playing throughout. Rocks hard and yet mellow too. Bears repeated listening.
0345428064|5.0|After reading Bravo Two Zero and Immediate Action I decided to take a read of Remote Control, being the first fiction book Andy McNab has written I was unsure what to expect.  After reading the first few pages I was hooked, it got my interest right away.  Andy McNab maintains his successful down to earth writing style, he is descriptive but to the point, its rare you find yourself bored by a flood of inconsequential technical details.<br />The character, Nick Stone, is like McNab an ex SAS soldier.  He now lives his life doing deniable operations for the British intelligence agency.  The rest you just got to read to find out.<br />It's this book that opens the door to what I hope will be a very interesting and somewhat educating series of books.  McNab's down to earth sense of things shows in the way he writes the book, Nick Stone is no super hero, he can't take out a whole regiment of soldiers with a few grenades and an Uzi.  This is the kind of book I have been waiting for, a book written by a guy who knows what he is talking about, he knows his characters limits and he doesn't breach these, I only hope this is maintained through the series.<br />I particulary like the obvious advertising placed in the book, it must be nice to be offered such a large sum of money to mention a product in your book, nice one Mr McNab!<br />I give this book 5 Stars.
0385504209|5.0|I am an avid reader, going through a minimum of 5 books a week, and I would rate this as the top pick of my year so far.  The book was well researched, and managed to be enlightening and entertaining at the same time, a difficult task for even the most seasoned writers.<br />Brown tells the simple story of a man framed for murder, and his escape from the French police with the help of the granddaughter of the man he supposedly murdered and assorted friends.  What makes this interesting and different from all the other basic frame-up thrillers?<br />The interplay of an ancient legend, the Priory of Sion, and the Holy Grail into the story.  Yes, this has been written before, but never in such an intricate display of detail with attention to entertainment value as well.  Don't take this with a grain of salt, and don't pass up the book for something you might think is lighter.  For those who enjoy thrillers, self-acclaimed history buffs, and the general public, this is an excellent pick, worthy of the time it will take to read.
