B007GCY8FS|5.0|I started reading the Reacher series last year. I've enjoyed them all. A Wanted Man is one of the best of the series and I highly recommend this book to anyone!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I love this movie!  The store is sweet and family friendly and the animation is incredible.  I love all the little nods to old video games as well.  The HD quality of the streaming video was good.  we didn't have any problems with it.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|I did not enjoy this near as much as minecraft,the graphics were astounding but you only get like 10 min before you have to buy it I STRONGLY reccomend minecraft
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a cute game, holds interest for my nine year old daughter.  Would reccommend to any My Little Pony fan.
B000002UEB|5.0|I'm listening to the CD today, about 25 years after its release. I am still blown away at its perfection. This IS my \\"desert island album\\". There is no weak part, it is pure adrenaline. Queensryche WITH Geoff Tate, it does not get better than this.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|True to form with twists and turns that keep you glued. Her writing is intriguing and she is one of my new favorites. Rated higher than girl gone because I need for the novel to have an ending.. bring on the Gillian Flynn novel!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is more fun and somewhat challenging. A great time filler while waiting for the Dr.  at his office. Good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Cheap, easy, accurate - my three favorite words! I needed a tool for my Kindle to extend its uses and this calculator was a great addition.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|What can you say about a DVD, except that you wouldn't buy it unless you wanted the movie. I realized that I didn't have the ending of my series and found it on amazon.com for a great price. Thanks!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This is the first book of Dan Browns that I have read.  The author keeps you going, through plot twist and turns. I loved this book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game easy to use with kindle fire downloading takes a while but once it downloads the game speed is fine
B0026P3G12|5.0|Great album...You can't go wrong listening to Susan Boyle...She really is an incredible talent...How many more people are 'out there' like her?
B000RUAR5G|1.0|It's alright if you have kids that are really into basketball and old school Looney Toons but I forgot how dumb this movie was a kid.  My little one didn't enjoy it at all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Most of my Amazon purchases are for gifts, but this was for me. I enjoyed it immensely and was very pleased with the viewing quality.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I was hesitant to read it feeling it would be another Nazi regime story that I have personally had my fill of. Because of who recommended it and what they had to say, \\"you will be surprised and it won't dsappoint\\" knowing they knew my feelings I was intrigued. This book did not disappoint. It was less about the Hiltler's evil and more a character study in a horrific backdrop but it is tastefully and well done. The writing is engaging and Fischer a good storyteller. I can honestly now say I pass along the recommendation to read this and doubtful it will disappoint. I'm not easily entertained but this one was enjoyable.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is fun and challenging for me but not too scary for my 10 year old. We have gotten a good amount of game time with it too.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|Movie was OK.  It's a movie based off a toy so there is only SO much they can do with that.  However watching Channing Tatum makes everything in life a little better.  :)
B008JFUTUY|5.0|First saw parts of this on 60 Minutes.  This is one of the most inspiring documentaries that I have ever watched.  It is a must see.
B000002GOZ|2.0|I really can't review this one adequately because I purchased it for my other half and he prefers Bryan Adams not &#34;Unplugged&#34; and I am not sure how he feels about it.  Sorry I can't help with this one.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|The concept is fine, the graphics are nice, but I simply could not get into the game.  Its a mix of strategy and quick reactions, that is plan out when to change the points on the tracks, then go for it.
B009329Y30|5.0|1-The movie is NEVER as good as the book so check out the book first.<br />2-Great movie.  Classic date night movie.
B004YXE438|3.0|I would give this game 3  1/2 stars.  It is a little better than okay.  It has levels that you can really test your memory.  I have played it several times at the easy level so I could get the hang of it.  I have moved up a level and it is a lot more challenging. The colors and pictures are very pretty.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|For the life of me, I don't understand why this series was cancelled !!!  We are so upset that this series was not renewed.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|We have two use cases for this charger, when we forget to charge a tablet and need to keep the kids quiet with a video, the second is when I'm at conferences and using the smartphone intensely throughout the day, so this keeps the smartphone running into the evening.  Its versatility is great, through you need a procedure to ensure once it is used its recharged, nothing more frustrating than going to use it to discover someone else has discharged and not recharged it.  So once its connected to a device we let is fully discharge, then plug it in the recharge.  I'll update next year once I know how the cycling affects its performance.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This set is really well put together and the case is sturdy!  I'd buy it for a friend and recommend it to others.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Nice for finding your way around, but not as bright as I thought it would be.  I do use it though
B004T2QZL8|1.0|i played the free version to see how it is and i lved it so i decided to buy it but then when it finished downloading i press it to play it and it starts off good but right when i click play it instantly goes back to my opening screen saying doodle god has stopped working. i love the game but i know i know i just wasted 1.07 on a game that wont even work.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.<br />Gripping story.<br />Denzel Washington reliable as ever.<br />Picture and sound excellent  sound in Blu Ray.<br />Highly recommended!
1476712042|5.0|You wont go wrong with this novel.  Awesome, page turning read!  You will become so engulfed with Pidge and Travis!  If you are looking for a great read; this is it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Someone recommend this movie to me months ago and I finally got around to seeing it.  This is not your typical coming of age or high school movie. It was very well acted and dealt with a very rich story.  I would highly recommend.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is a game for when you get board and you have time.I would not recommend it for all the time,you would get board with it if you played it all the time.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I only played with it as soon as it was downloaded. Seems easy to use and read with clear big numbers.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I'm a Lincoln fan and this was my 5th or 6th book. Bought it to prepare for the movie. Couldn't put it down. Superior detail and smooth reading.  DAMN this book was GOOD!
B00BI745AA|1.0|I am not a huge fan of musicals but have enjoyed every Andrew Loyd Webber production I have ever seen. This is NOT an Andrew Loyd Webber. The songs are not that good to start with and when performed by these non-singers it is unberable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Liked the book better than the movie and wish I had read it before watching the movie.  The book allowed me to understand and emphasize with the characters.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Daniel really shows off his chops, more doomed character than Potter; in some ways, unable to deal with losses, The death of children is always disturbing and that is the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars; the story's ending was way sad, but made sense as well.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|So far I love it. What is up with the almost threesome.. I cant wait for The main plot to unravel.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love British serials.  Many of the characters are in other British works, fun to see them playing different roles. thanks for offering these on amazon.
B007P7UF06|5.0|This is such a great story and Richard Harris is amazing. A must see if you like the story of King Arthur
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What a ride, cameos were even cool, loved the personality differences between Bilbo and Frodo, Peter Jackson ended up directing anyhow, looking forward to the next installment
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It was a really addicting, good game.  That pretty much says it all. seriously, that's it!  No more.  I'm done.
B00280LYHS|5.0|There is almost nothing better then Rick riordans books and series! This was totally awesome and one of the best a lot of great moments.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel was nominated for Best Actor in this film, and I think it was a worthy nomination.  I must confess, however, that I am a big fan and think Denzel has deserved the nomination in several of his other films, which he did not get the nomination.  His performance in this will film is typical top-notched Denzel work...outstanding and powerful.  The movie, however was a bit predictable.  I have never seen so much boozing in my life.  His character imbibed more than Nicholas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas.  Good movie with John Goodman as a scene stealer.
B00004U45G|4.0|Soemone stole my original, so I had to rebuy this, wish they had released a dvd, Jimmy is far too sloppy on some tracks marvelous on others and a mixture of both on You're TIme is Gonna Come. Still a mistake in the title of &#34;shape of things&#34;<br />&#34;shape of things to come&#34; was a different tune by another 60s band.
B0063IH60K|5.0|So easy and I go back and forth with this game and my puzzles but I am loving them both.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a unique read in many ways - including the setting (man stranded on Mars) and the style (a humorous yet analytical approach to surviving alone on a barren planet.)  Definitely worth reading - especially if you appreciate ingenuity and problem-solving (as well as a protagonist with a good sense of humor.)
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Too much football and basically boring. Forced myself to finished the book. I Would not recommend this book to anyone.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Thor, Iron Man, the Hulk, Hawkeye all seem real, all right in your face, was almost better that what I imagined in my head as a kid, well done Whedon! Sad to see Coulson go, really started to like that Character.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I got this game for my husband and he loves it, we are going to have to get another kindle fire if he keeps this up....HAPPY HUBBY
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The music in this movie is really beautiful. I showed it to my kindergarten students this winter, and they really liked it. The animation shows a fun and cute story! (there's no talking)
B003DZ0JI2|5.0|Love all of her music, no disappointment had only heard one song when I ordered this cd and two others.
B0038P59A0|5.0|what a wild film and ride, Holmes by Downey is very disturbed, brilliant and different, Law as Watson, more with it, what a team!
B002JUXNOY|4.0|Scary because it was taken mostly from a story that actually happened.  Whether you're a believer in the supernatural or not, I thought it was interesting and scary at times.
B001POX73C|5.0|Heyer has a talent for portraying well-defined characters in humorous situations. Her light touch with the oddly formal speech of her period characters makes her books enchanting and very enjoyable to read. Her Regency books are warm, funny, and truly delightful, full of absurd situations and characters and always provide a happy and heartwarming ending.
B0000C23DO|5.0|This is a very good collection of Grateful Dead songs. Will not disappoint any true fan of the Dead. Very pleased with both the product and price. The transaction was good also.<br /><br />Bill Craig
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I hate the artwork, mostly because the font is too small to read, the music is great and much like where he left off.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My 2 year old granddaughter loves to color on my Kinde Fire using the Coloring Book for Toddlers. It was very kid friendly to use with her tiny fingers or the stylus that I had on hand.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have enjoyed this series since the 3rd grade. Excellent book, and I do wonder why girls go in the bathroom in groups!
B000002UDG|5.0|Very pleased with this selection of songs by Paul McCartney. If the album was this good then just imagine how much better it would be now containing more of his songs. Very good transaction.<br /><br />Bill Craig
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Much better than I heard about or what I expected, well done.I m still upset Evans didn't return one more time as Johnny Storm-(for the Fantastic Four franchise) but he is much better at Captain America.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love love this book, better than the first, can't wait to read the third! I could feel how torn Katniss was throughout the entire book.
B00849F82E|5.0|I Love that You offer theses books for our kindles.  The book was great and I love how fast it was delivered to my kindle.
B007IK44CK|5.0|none stop action, also a littlie comedy thrown in. This is my favorite Mission impossible movie yet. You will not be disappointed
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|I enjoyed the music in the movie so much I had to buy the soundtrack. I knocked off a star since there seemed to be a couple of random songs that were in the movie that were missing and the raw-ness of the sound is gone. Everything is studio polished which is nice but it really loses a lot of the character that the sound had in the movie.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I am being generous with my rating!  Where do I go to get my 200 minutes back??  I do not recommend watching this.  Not worth the time.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I Love that You offer theses books for our kindles.  The book was great and I love how fast it was delivered to my kindle.
B001CT877Q|5.0|Arrived quickly, in time to give as a gift and my son loved it (14 yrs old), he's a huge Arnold Schwartznegger fan!
B0031CO3WA|2.0|My son's plane came with 2 right wings. And obviously, the extra right wing doesn't fit on the left side. I haven't had a chance to send it back yet, but what a disappointment for him :(<br />I love Schleich products. My son has 100's of their animals, but this was one purchase that was a let down
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't want to love this series but I simply could not help but love it. I got sucked into season 1 and could not stop until I saw all of them!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I Love that You offer theses books for our kindles.  The book was great and I love how fast it was delivered to my kindle.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It took a few chapters to engage and then I couldn't put it down. The two time frames story line was an interesting way to have the story unfold.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this app but I think it needs mods.<br />I hope you get this so you might change this game and give it mods. Yay minecraft. Woop,woop !!!!!!! So ya GO MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Minecraft is my #1 game. Hope you make more minecraft things.  : )
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely beautiful, heartbreaking but beautiful. Loved each and every character. Made me reflect upon life and the things we take for granted. Beautifully written.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I Love that You offer theses books for our kindles.  The book was great and I love how fast it was delivered to my kindle.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game there is always something to do and u get to see all kinds of cool animals plus my little brothers LOVE it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|better than the first. the controls are more succinct and enjoy the storyline too. the graphics are better as well.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|3 of my top 10 movies of all time!  A very good price! What more needs to  be said?  Very satisfied
0312117337|5.0|i love this tarot deck. very self-explanatory, each card has one word or phrase on it that instantly displays its insight. the images on each card are very helpful. out of dozens of readings i have only referenced the book one time....the cards and their zen words and imagery are able to speak for themselves most of the time. i use this tarot daily due to the amazing response i have had from it!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|The movie was wonderful. Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, and Ian McKellan were excellent. I also loved Balin and Bofur. The extras were actually quite fun to watch, too!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this! I love guessing games! This one is the best because i get to make pictures too! Most of the games make you guess other things but this one e lets you make your own things! I love it and i think you should get it!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Actors, plot, every scene keeps you on the edge of your seat.  If you like watching intelligent shows, start watching Homeland!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Pretty close to dinner dash! It may not look fun, but it is. I got two new games, hello kitty season salon and this one, but this one is my favorite. I say get it. Enjoy!!! ;-)
0316044695|5.0|Told by the only person who made it back alive from Operation Redwing in Afghanistan.  Follow up with his next book, &#34;Service&#34; for more details.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is awesome it's great for 7year old and higher you have to get it you will never take your eyes off it<br />Also I'm 13
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This re-telling of Romeo and Juliet still resonates, some 50 years after it first appeared in<br />movie theaters. Wonderful music! and the cross-cultural romance is very contemporary, while<br />being timeless.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The price was great considering it will probably only get played on a small media player.  So the lower resolution for that price was NOT a problem.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and I think I've read every book of his. I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  The book left me wondering what on earth was going to happen next every chapter, and it gave a great twist at the end. If you like sappy love stories read this! Even if you don't care for sappy love stories it's still a good read centered around family and love.
8866130915|5.0|Good price. Good quality. What else do you really need to know? If you have owned a moleskine before than you know what kind of quality they are. Get this.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Well folks, it is all and more of what I thought it might be. Whew !!!!!!!!!!!!!  The sex part threw me off a bit at first, but then, hey ---- it's HBO afterall. Soooooooooooooooo with that I dove right in and enjoyed the daylights out of it :) Love the IMP!!!! They sure knew who to hire for the actors. This cast will go down in history !!! IF they live long enough :) ----------------- great series, will purchase the next ones too.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have not finished the book yet, but so far it great.This is the seventh book I have read by Nicholas Sparks,  all great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Let my grandson get this game, and he and his brother loves it, and that is good enough for me!<br /><br />Rhonda/OSSlady
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Fabulous!<br />What a great book! I wold greatly recommend to someone that is in search of life, meaning of life, search of themselves.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Can't wait for the next one :)<br />Read the books, so had wondered how they would put it together. Did a good job. Excellent choices for the actors.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is quite fun!! I just don't like the fact that u have to download graphics everytime I enter a new room!!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|It was very good and explained how Teresa came it was very VERY good and I would want one after the death cure
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I'm not a big sci fi fan, but really enjoyed this book and ender's game. Card creates a believable future and a stark look at the human mind.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|What a cute, sometimes sad, thankfully a cartoon that can have any ending it wants kind of movie. I had to laugh at the connections with the original movie Frankenstein. Tim Burton, you either get him or you don't. I get him :) The &#34;Egor&#34; kid is priceless, Marty Feldman would be proud of him. OOPs, that's Young Frankenstein, but whatever ----- glad I got it.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game def give it a 5 star because it has cute graphics and is very relaxing to play.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Yet another great album with clever/crazy lyrics and amazing riffs. If you enjoyed the last few releases you will enjoy this one as well. It isn't as heavy as their earlier stuff and they still have heavy blues elements but personally I love that. However, it has some renewed vigor (with a few exceptions) to put it closer to Blast Tyrant.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I had to wait so long for new Clutch!
B007EC27QM|4.0|I use this app frequently when I work from home. it has enough features to conduct simple business operations and you can see your previous entry.
0547848412|5.0|Well written, --------------- I laughed out loud, cried, was amazed, this book brought out so many emotions while reading. It is truly a book worth owning. I loaned mine to a friend and realized it wasn't coming home, so I had to purchase another one, gladly. There is a lesson here ------ read the book based on a true story. Amazing !!
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I never did get it to load. It said it was on my cloud, but I never could find it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a great film. Very good story of survival that makes one think; what would I do in that situation? Such wonderful cinematography!
145210655X|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who has seen Star Wars. Kids will be kids. You will be laughing at the depictions of real life kids interpreted into this cute book. My son and d-i-l just had a child and named him LUKE. We couldn't resist ordering this book. They love the book and plan on making it a little keepsake.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie is a treat for the eyes. How they filmed this is beyond belief, but you will find yourself believing. I saw this in the theater and knew I had to have the dvd. Just because !!! It will be one of my all time favorite movies from now on.
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|I'm not sure what attracted me to this recording initially, probably being a fan of Joe Bonamassa's blues guitar mastery. I didn't have any specific expectations... I was and am blown away. This album is so much fun. Each musician is really a master and they obviously love this genre. The funk is heavy, the riffs are there, the soloing is exceptional and the band is exceptionally tight!<br /><br />If you loved/liked the Jeff Beck Blow by Blow/Wired era you'll really love this.<br />Also check out their youtube live show at Don Randi's Baked Potato in LA. It's incredible. Long solo's, great songs such as \\"Led Boots\\", \\"I'm a Man\\",  and incredible \\"The Thrill Gone\\" and tons more (plus stretched out versions of their recording... that your reading about now!).<br /><br />At any rate, check it out.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|This movie was a real downer. Way too dark. We don't need any more paranoia about potential terrorists. Lets get back our original Comic Book hero!
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|As a child, I laid awake reading and re-reading Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' so many times that I snapped the spines on three copies. Many times as well have I perused the pages of 'Unfinished Tales', 'The Similarion', 'Children of Hurin' and, of course, the Holy Trilogy itself. Each installment was more wondrously detailed and epic than the last and I devoured them all happily, but it was 'The Hobbit' that I enjoyed the most and that holds true for me to this day. There's something just ever so charming and lovable about that book that keeps me coming back for more and more.<br />So, naturally, I was excited for the film adaptation. The films Jackson had made out of the Holy Trilogy were excellent. True, they lacked the mythological, historical and political tapestry that made up the background of the books, but they far out did JRR in terms of pacing, so I've always called that one even-Steven. It just seemed to me that Jackson \\"got\\" the Trilogy is some unique way, a way that let him capture it's essence even while having to hack it up to make due with the limitations of cinema (I still say I'd have preferred a televised mini-series) and Jackson is an immensely talented filmmaker. One would expect then, that the first of his 'Hobbit' trilogy (and I still can't believe it's being split into three. Two I could see, especially with how long they are, but three? Come on) would be on par with his previous Tolkien works.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Oh, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is by no means a poor film. It looks remarkable, sounds even better, the camera work is stunning as is the music. The acting is great (most notably on Gollum), Bilbo and Gandalf are both enchanting all over again and the film has a tremendous sense of setting and place as well as being highly atmospheric. I do like this film, but the issue is all of this unneeded added content. Plot threads have been taken from 'Unfinished Tales' and 'The Similarion' and shoved in for, honestly, no real tenable reason. They drag the pacing out quite a bit at times and they take the focus off the characters, leaving us with Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin and 12 interchangeable bearded gents you will neither remember properly or even care about (even if you did read the book). The start of Bilbos arc through the series can feel a bit condensed as well. The real issue is in how this derails the story telling. Going from the fairly small story of 'The Hobbit', wherein the journey is much bigger than the plot or destination, to apocalyptic portents of Dark Lords rising to plunge the land into darkness and death is just too jarring and too mismatched. It often feels as though Jackson hurriedly stitched two different films together. There was no need to pad this out to a trilogy, nor any need to \\"epic up\\" 'The Hobbit' and the new elements, while nicely done in their own right, serve little purpose and only drag the whole production down. The same can be said for the battle scenes: very nice (great even) in their own right, but far too big (or just plain unneeded) for such a small-in-scale narrative.<br /><br />That all being said, I still liked the film a good bit. It's a very fun, exciting film that's not too well put together in some areas. It's like getting one hundred dollars and then getting punched in the gut. The money is great, but getting knocked to the ground was still unpleasant. Overall, as weird as it may be, I enjoyed it. I highly suggest seeing it, just don't expect the same greatness as the last three outings Mr. Jackson gave us.<br /><br />Oh, and as for the DVD and/or Blu-Ray of the film? Well, I'd just wait until the inevitable six film mega boxset comes out. It's a few years down the road but we all know it's going to happen. Save your pennies and wait everyone.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|OK, I'm ready for season 3 now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I'm so invested in the story. I've read the books and am hanging by my fingertips WAITING for the next BOOK, ahem, OK, for purchase purposes, can't wait for the next years series too !!!! Great adventure so full of crazy, wonderful, interesting and deadly characters. HBO is doing a wonderful job, George RR must be a proud papa.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Loved the LOR series own both theatrical and extended editions.... Was disappointed by this flick!  Read all the books and this movie leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.  I wanted to enjoy this movie, but found myself rolling my eyes in frustration.  Seems too much spacer material, not enough dialogue,  poor character development.  This movie had the potential.... but Jackson had to overdue it.  I feel if Guillermo del Toro had directed it the end results would be far superior.<br /><br />Jackson almost whores this movie out to promote LOR.... there are only a few things the two have in common: ring, characters, and a few items.  The cameos are stupid and do nothing for the movie.<br /><br />Save your money... Jackson is just trying to pull a Lucas and recycle old material and claim its new while exploiting the consumer to make millions.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This was a really awesome story, a true story of love, loss, and the struggle to persevere as well as excel! The cinematography was very well done, which made it complete.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Just wanted to add my tuppence as I am a UK buyer that has imported this title from the US site (despite me being keen to order it, the UK wasn't stocking it on release day!).<br /><br />Discs are confirmed as multi-region, and delivery from Amazon was around two weeks, well before the expected delivery date. I didn't have to pay any extra customs fees etc.<br /><br />The digital edition is US only however (when using iTunes) - no problem for me, as I have a US iTunes account, but other UK buyers should be aware of this. If you google then you can find tips on how to do this too.<br /><br />Quality wise,  the film was great and the 3D element added to one of my favourite films of all time made this twenty-something British geek grin from ear to ear.<br /><br />A sound investment - go for it and get that surround sound cranked up too!!
B0099114WO|5.0|A wake up call for some I'll bet. I know it's true so many older couples lose themselves in the daily routines we allow ourselves to hold up in. I was so touched by the remorse of a life lost, if, the husband couldn't come to grips with his comfort zone. The wife was just as lost in some respect, but thankfully they realized their life &#34;together&#34; for the rest of their lives, was more important than not trying to restore intimacy in the marriage. Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep ---- dang, what a combination. Good Movie, but not a gushy wonderfully painted postcard.
B00K0OI42W|5.0|All time favorite classic.
B004GCK6XY|5.0|Great Movie starring a fabulous actress.  The Blu-Ray arrived on schedule and was well packaged, what more can you say?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally addictive, my kids and I love it! Great way to keep the kids busy while I'm driving! We have it on all devices!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show sucks you right in from the pilot episode.  Excellent plot and character development.  I've wanted to watch this show for many years, I'm happy it finally came to amazon prime instant video.
B0030GIQM0|4.0|I had the original album when it originally was released in the 70's. I liked it then and still like it, although it was not a big chart topper for J5 back then. I just had to purchase this for my ipod just so I would not have to play the LP. It is a must for all real J5 lovers.
B001KX50BK|5.0|Great Movie starring a fabulous actress.  The Blu-Ray arrived on schedule and was well packaged, what more can you say?
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I enjoy playing this game while watching TV.  Keeps me busy.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a mindless game to play :)
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great fun time killer. Excellent game play. Easy controls and gets pretty challenging. I Would recommend to any one. Love the retro feel.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|This is my 3rd blade runner copy as I got two other DVD versions of the movie but this is a nice package since you can watch 2-3 different versions of the movie on the 2nd disc I think but overall I love it. Damn shame this movie is underrated and it's sad that alot of younger people today admits they &#34;seen&#34; this movie but when I question them about what happens in the movie, they finally admit they didn't see it or paid attention. It's like they are trying to admit they &#34;Seen&#34; it when they really haven't just be to &#34;cool&#34; or trying to act like they love the movie when they never even own it or seen it, etc.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|A depressing drama full of fights and swear words between a family of four. You will find some laughable moments the first 15 minutes and occasionally during the rest of the movie. It should last 90 minutes at most, I do not know how I made it to watch the more than two hours movie. The movie title and trailer were totally deceptive.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry Goodkind is a fantastic writer he brings his characters alive!  I could read this series again and again and it would still seem like I am reading it for the first time!!
B000JQU1VS|1.0|IDK why this is in my lists to review, lol. But, I never bought this and never read it!  Hope this helps.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|Installed it, uninstalled it right away, not really the best app for all phones and it certainly didn't work on my 2 year old cell phone.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I felt like a child watching this. Wes Anderson does it again. Another great movie to add to his resume.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I chose this rating because I really like the story, though it is a bit thin. Anne Rice is a better erotica writer.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has been helpful. It shows me a lot of information. I would definitely recommend it.I like that is is a free app also.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|To this day I still believe the 1st season is still the best season out of all the dexters. The future seasons tend to drag on too much and dexter doesn't get enough kills by taking out bad people from the world. The first season has nearly one bad person in each episode that dexter eliminates but as the season progresses to 2,3,4,5,6 etc you find that Dexter starts to get bored and is surrounded by so much life drama bull crap that he can't even kill anymore bad guys!
B005ES5YEU|5.0|I especially like having two straps to hole the shoe securely to my foot.  In addition, I like the way I can get them as dirty as can be and then wash them so they look like new in just a few minutes.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Excellent pick up for my nieces and nephew.  They really enjoy they movie!  Good price for a special edition movie.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|We were very disappointed that the last couple minutes were cut off from the video.  It was obvious that they were wrapping up the show and it just stopped.  Other than that, it was a quick, easy way to watch one of our favorite shows.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We saw this on television and both my husband and I fell in love with it.  Eagerly looking forward to the new season
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I downloaded movies from my PC to Kindle Fire and was informed in needed to download a personal player to watch them. This is the only app that says it can play your personal movies all the other apps work for pictures.  After installing the player it ran my movies completely choppy and I had no volume. I wish there was an app for the Kindle Fire that could play movies you have saved on other devices and transferred to the kindle instead of only having the option to buy movies from amazon.
B009JBZH54|5.0|My brother in law just got a Blu-Ray player and this was a great addition to his collection of disks.  Great Christmas present!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|i love but always when i just complete a mission i find a shell and have to do the EXACT same one over AGAIN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
B004S3MB2U|4.0|I found this calculator very versatile to use. There are segments that I will probably never use but if I ever needed them they would be there. I would just have to go back to school to learn how to use them.
B0048LPRCS|5.0|Incredible movie. You have to watch this movie and travel along with the soul as it embarks on its journey once the body dies.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Seems to lack some functions I'd like to see. Such as in depth hour by hour and seeing what the background would looklike for a given hour.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|This story deserved an ending.  I enjoyed it but was terribly disappointed with so many loose ends.  Too many characters unaccounted for...Too many questions left unanswered :/
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like the new premises and birds. That is what makes it another AB hit. Just wish there was a menu to tell you what all the icons are for.
B00A757EFW|4.0|One of the first games I learned to play. I really enjoy it. Easy game to play and glad to see it available.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is exactly what it says; a retro Invasion game updated with better graphics.  This game is also unusual among its type in that the controls make it easy to see the entire screen.  (Cheat: you can teleport around the screen by tapping where you want to appear)
B00003JA7P|5.0|Good album for the collection, quite a few good songs. A few not so good ones, but hey, you cant get the best every time.<br />Over all, its a great album.
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE this game because it is like subway surfers (which  is AWESOME) it has a lot of twists and turns and jumps and sildes. also fun and easy for kids
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have a Mahjong  game on my computer and love it more, but this one isn't too bad.  It will keep you busy.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|I like puzzle games, but Ichi needs to find the balance between &#34;puzzling&#34; and &#34;frustratingly difficult.&#34;  I have had to find walkthroughs for several levels.<br /><br />Of course, I may just not be that bright.
B0001I562I|5.0|Awesome movie from my childhood, got it for my nephews. They like it, i think. it was cool when we were kids, although low-tech by todays standards.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Not too hard not too easy. Just enough different puzzles to keep you guessing. Get this game if you like the hidden item games but want more.
0062014536|5.0|It's a great ending to the Delirium trilogy. It's told from Lena and her best friend she left behind Hana. It will make you smile and cry at the same time. Couldn't put it down!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book should be made into a movie!  Very suspensful with great character's, the main one being a twin to Jack Reacher.  The subject of human trafficking is very disturbing,  would like to think there are hero's like these in the real world.  Very fast paced thriller a great read.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Brought back so many childhood memories! Q-Bert made an appearance...Awesome! The people who made it did great with the animation. It was funny, sweet and exciting. Great movie/great concept!
B005K0HDGE|1.0|Could not get past the bad language in this book, so i did not even finish reading it. Wish there was a language rating for books.
006197806X|4.0|Really enjoyed reading it. It makes you sad for Lena because she has to go through the wilds alone. But keep reading to find out what happened to Alex.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is so much fun to play with the birds dressed as Star Wars characters.  I even got my brother to play and he also thought it was really fun.
B007REV4YI|5.0|'Skyfall' is being heralded in some quarters as the best 007 film ever.<br /><br />Pretty bold talk, and not altogether false. It's going to be hard for any new effort in the series to capture the essence of James Bond after such iconic examples as 'Goldfinger' (1964) or 'Thunderball' (1965).  Even Roger Moore's brilliant re-imagining of the character in 'Live and Let Die' stands alone. That said, the 23rd film in the most esteemed series in film history (7 out of 10 people in THE WORLD have seen a Bond film) by director Sam Mendes and starring Daniel Craig is superlative example.<br /><br />The plot- Bond is thought killed in action and a rogue agent declares war on MI-6 and particularly on it's boss 'M' (Dame Judi Dench) is brought down to it's core emotional levels of honor, revenge, courage and perserverance. It connects on ALL of those levels. Director Mendes ('American Beauty') and a stellar cast including Javier Badim as a notable, nuanced bad guy<br />offer a film that is exciting and thoughtful throughout, and Director of Photography Roger Deakins ('Fargo', and other Coen bros. films) shot the living bejeebus out of it and garnered his TENTH Oscar nomination. At 2 hours and 20 minutes or so there isn't an ouce of flab anywhere to be seen.<br /><br />Thomas Newman wrote an Oscar nominated score for it and Adele won a much deserved Academy Award for the title song.<br /><br />The film gets better on repeated viewings. Not always the case with recent Bond outings. But it is SO rich that you will continuously find something cool you missed. Has the best ending of any film since the good old days; establishing Ralph Fiennes as the new- oops plot giveaway- not going to go there.<br /><br />Great stuff. Hope the next outing is as good as this was...
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very relaxing! Really makes you think about where you make everything go. I think<br />the music fits it perfectly. 20
0061726834|4.0|It's a good read about a forbidden love and best friends. Lena agrees that a cure for Love will fix everything, she lost her mother to love or she thought. Then she meets Alex, and everything changes.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season three has so many twists and turns.  We have enjoyed seeing the fascinating developments and will watch it again!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|The movie was delivered promptly and packaged well. The movie itself sucked. It was an attempt to look into the future for our origins but came up woefully short.
B008O037RG|4.0|This isn't a review of the album, but of the vinyl release.  As a record collector, I have had recent vinyl pressings ranging from great to awful, so I will offer my insight to fellow collectors considering this purchase.<br /><br />First of all, the packaging is excellent.  The outer sleeve is vibrantly colored with a photo quality matte finish.  It is a gate fold, to boot.  The inner sleeve contains the liner notes and lyrics, instead of being a generic sleeve, and looks like they actually put some thought into its design.  The record itself is heavy, with non-generic center labels.  On top of this, it comes with a download code for those times you don't feel like carrying your turntable with you to the gym!  Whoever packaged this payed allot of attention to detail.  My only complaint is that my copy had some whitish residue on the vinyl itself.  It didn't seem to affect the sound, but isn't cosmetically appealing.<br /><br />The actual sound quality of the vinyl is high, for recent pressings.  It doesn't sound as muffled and muted as many recent releases I've purchased.  I've heard better, but this is by no means bad.<br /><br />If you like the Mumford sound and collect vinyl, this is a good purchase.
B00445RHKI|5.0|Every season of Modern Family is 5 stars so there's not much else to write about.  I can watch each episode multiple times and they're always funny.
0062014536|4.0|I quite enjoyed Requiem, but it was a bit of a letdown compared to Delirium and Pandemonium.  Both Delirium and Pandemonium were so gripping - in Delirium we fall in love with Alex and Lena and want them to be together, and in Pandemonium we're faced with rebellion, Julian, and a much tougher Lena.  Requiem didn't hold my attention as much as the other two.<br /><br />What on earth was up with the romance?  Because it hardly played into the story at all.  (I can't believe I'm complaining about a lack of romance, but oh well.)  See, the point of the story is that Lena and the others are fighting for the right to love.  And yet, in Requiem, Lena hardly ever shows a good reason why/who she wants to love.<br /><br />Also, Alex and Julian feel so different in this story.  They don't seem like the characters they used to be in the previous novels.  Alex seems stilted and Julian is just awkward.  It's kind of hard to see why Lena loves them.  Still, that said, I loved the other minor characters.  They play great roles.<br /><br />I am happy that I liked the addition of Hana's point of view.  I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it, but I ended up really liking her as a narrator.  She's a wonderful, strong character that I sympathized with a lot, and I think her story adds to the plot.<br /><br />The writing is just as gorgeous as ever.  I am in love with Lauren Oliver's writing - it's simple, poetic, and striking.  And this is still one of my favorite dystopian worlds, despite the fact that Delirium was one of the first dystopians I ever read and I've read maaany dystopians since then.  I'm fascinated by the idea of a world where love is a disease.<br /><br />Of course, I have to mention the infamous ending.  Definitely a big reason why I wasn't totally crazy about Requiem.  Honestly, it's just a terrible ending.  Nothing is resolved, and it left me with so many questions: What happens to Hana next?  What about a couple of those minor characters who, we are led to believe, get killed off?  What happens to the guy Lena doesn't choose (nooo, I'm not saying who)?  More importantly, why does Lena choose the guy she ends up choosing?  I didn't feel like there was a clear answer to that question.<br /><br />So yes, I enjoyed Requiem.  I think the romance wasn't half as good as it was in the first two books, and the ending is awful, but I really did love it besides from those two issues.  It's a beautifully written dystopian, and this is still one of my favorite series.  If you loved Delirium and Pandemonium, definitely read Requiem to see how it ends.  Just be prepared - it probably won't blow you away like the first two did.d off?  What happens to the guy Lena doesn't choose (nooo, I'm not saying who)?  More importantly, why does Lena choose the guy she ends up choosing?  I didn't feel like there was a clear answer to that question.<br /><br />So yes, I enjoyed Requiem.  I think the romance wasn't half as good as it was in the first two books, and the ending is awful, but I really did love it besides from those two issues.

B001FBIPF0|4.0|Great CD if you are into this type of music. Not their best album but it is a great one.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!!I love chopping up the fruit and avoiding the bombs. But why is it 4 stars. That is CRAZY! But I &lt;3 the game totally.
B005OP2928|5.0|Just another great season of Modern Family.  The show never dissapoints and is one that I can even watch with my mother.  Highly recommend!
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I'm reviewing both the movie and the Amazon streaming service. Both were very good! Parents: this film may not be right for small kids.  It's a faithful adaptation. Of a classic graphic novel. Looking forward to part 2.
B0000714BP|5.0|Patrick Swayze, what a wonderful way to remember him. I laugh until my stomach ache.Wesley Snipes was too much as a drag queen!
B005LBF7CY|5.0|Great book interesting read all the way through.  Enjoyed the story line and involvement of the characters and the hotel.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|It says in the ad that it supports Thai language, however, when i got it realized that it was talking about the DVD version of it not the Blu ray version. However, its still a great deal for only 30 dollars and they give you blu ray, DVD and digital versions of the complete season.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The books are way better than the movie. Keeps you turning the page. Moving on to the third book now!
0765325950|5.0|It's a great wind up to the story.  When you realize that Robert Jordan has been in real war,  this book makes perfect sense.  Well done Mr. Jordan.  Thanks also to Harriet ,her team, and Brandon Sanderson.
0446547654|5.0|I have all of his books and looking forward to his new one.<br />it stood up to all my expcttations. and more. Couldn't stop the tears<br />One of my favorite books but would be hard to pick just one favorite book.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I must admit that I am addicted to &#34;match 3&#34; games.  This one is good. The graphics are good but I am having a little bit of difficulty seeing the different tokens.  Don't know how to explain it.  They don't stand out from each other.  Maybe i just need to get used to the new game and images.  Overall I am enjoying it.
B00838HRP2|1.0|I got this dvd for my 2 year old. I waited more about 2 weeks for it. when i get it I put it in the DVD player and it won't play. It says region code error. I put it in my xbox to play it and same thing happens. Im guessing this was shipped from another country or something. Im not sure. But I paid good money for something I can't even watch. Not happy at all.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved it was the best one I have loved.<br />I was so amazing and cool indie my self<br /><br />PS loved it
B00006AFUR|5.0|This is such an awesome album, I had not heard many of the songs on this album as I am relatively a newer fan.  I was not disappointed.  The guys started out on a high note with this album and each album after has exceeded the last one.  Best band ever and great album.  Please buy this album, you will love it too!!!
B00004W221|5.0|I good movie for all ages, a proof that perseverance and faith, by work hard and pray, nothing is impossible...
B001414XLQ|5.0|System of a Down is my favorite band of all time. and this is the CD that started it for me. I will always love this CD. I re bought it after my physical CD was way to scratched to be copied to my PC. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone
B00A8ZZ3WM|5.0|I met him some years ago at Notodden Blues Festival here in Norway, he signed my records, A GENTLEMAN and superior on his harmonica!! To read the article about him and Ben Harper in Down Beat  last month was pure joy!! Dag
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Wow, this film really gets your mind going.  It depicts how dreadful drugs can impact your life and they can impact your life in many different fashions.  Jared Leto and the cast were amazing.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Ordered this based on publicity.  Very well packaged with discs, background info, and scene summary.<br />I would recomment this to anyone who likes high drama with a medieval &#34;historical&#34; element.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I went and saw this movie with my little cousin over the summer and we both LOVED it. I couldn't believe how much fun this movie was, I wasn't a fan of all of the movies separately but together its AMAZING. It may be a little long, but its great fun the entire time!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great book you should watch the show and play the game too. Overall is a great graphic novel and highly recommended by me.
B0043RGY60|5.0|I love every song on this album and recommend it to anyone who loves amazing music by an amazing band.  Also included in this Deluxe addition is a Video DVD that so incredible.  Who doesn't love to see their favorite band in action? LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  Bury it now!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like the game but it keeps freezing up and I have to force close it. please fix other then that its a great app.
B008EEWN6I|5.0|I love Serj Tankian, but he isn't for everyone. He has a unique sound to his voice, I can't deny that some times it sounds a little strange. But after System of a Down split up I was disappointed that I wouldn't get to hear them any more, this will definitely satisfy any SOAD fans out there and any other lovers of a little off the wall rock.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a good game though you cant really experience it I recamend it if you are 13 or younger
B00005JKDR|5.0|My kids love this movie! I also love this movie. Such a cute story! Everyone who watches it will love it!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The epic continues, as does my addiction to game of thrones. Watch it and love it. Just be sure you put your kids to bed first.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|I love TDG, they are one of my top bands. I have to say this isn't my favorite CD but its still really great.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Title says it all, I was sucked in immediately and had a hard time putting it down. Very unique and worth a try
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|We enjoy the whole wimpy kid series including the books and the movies, one book where my kids don't need the fancy pictures
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good movie... very compelling throughout. Kept everyone on the edge of their seat...<br />and we knew how it ended!!! ...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love all the temple's but  this is the best one so get it and its free<br />my kids love
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Shows available Wi-fi hotspots, rates signal, shows overlap, gives SSID and signal strength.  Great for analyzing what channels are available in your area or what is causing interference with your wifi.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|The game angry birds is addicting to all customers of any level of angry birds for all types even in the near future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is quite amazing and u just keep trying to get a better person.I love this game and you will love it too.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good build up to the story, nice resolution at the end (as per usual Grisham style) and overall solid writing. Less unique than his first few legal thrillers, which he has not topped since the Client came out.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great for road trips or if your sitting around might as well play at a reunion or a Holiday in time.
B008220C38|4.0|I was very happy with the way the subject matter was handled. definitely not with a heavy hand, and performances by the cast were all well integrated and believable to bring this great classic to life on the screen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun for little ones and adults. This game is very awesome. A little challenging , but not too hard. My favorite game on my kindle. UPLOAD NOW!!!!!!!! (:  I. &lt;3 this game
0345803485|5.0|I have not started this volume, but i am looking forward to the read. I here so much about the book and I am very curious.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A great app much better than the first temple run more challenges if u buy temples run brave or temple run oz they are very good too but this is the best you have to get it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Omg I'm addicted!!!  About to buy the next book. It is spool good and addicting. I have to know what happens.
0525952926|5.0|I grew up in a military family and have sat through many long stories about war and the political evolution of the world but I have never been as intrigued as i was about the details of our history. The characters put the facts we learned in school into perspective so that I could, for the first time, get an idea of what life for the people must have been like. We've all grown up hearing about what happened during the wars but most of us have never really understood the effects of such turmoil on a personal level until now. We learn of the evils committed but we seldomly gain perspective on the collective hardship that people felt during the wars; it is so easy to understand how ideals and intent can lead masses of people into fighting for something that no one wants. I wish our school books were as informative. History is nothing if it is not felt and understood and this book is amazing for what it communicates.<br /><br />Mr.Follet has also help to de-glamourize the military and world of espionage by illustrating the truth; how simple gestures and acts impacted the world without the Hollywood effects:-)<br /><br />I love the first 2 books! I can't wait for the 3rd!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is simple to use and I like the fade in as it doesn't jar you awake. It works everytime on both my phone and kindle.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, although I will admit that it was pretty rough around the edges.  If you are a fan of seventies fung fu I'd say take a shot and watch it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|this is my first preston book.  the German and Nazi twist with the good twin and bad twin put above all the books i have read this year.
0061124958|5.0|I'm reading this to my 3 & 6 year old, a chapter each night. They love it! It's  classic book and a great read for all ages. I definitely recommend this to read with your kiddos. I bought a used book, and got the hardback for less than $8. It was in great condition for a used book.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|i love this movie!!  deff for the hopeless romantic!!  sandra and keanu are great in movies together, wish they have done more!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Okay, so I really figured this series was for teenagers and there was no way I would make it through the 1st chapter. When I found the complete trilogy available on my Kindle for $5 I figured why not check it out....Yeah, 2 1/2 days later I finished reading it, bought the movie and then began reading it for a second time....At nearly 30 it completley held my interest. The more I began reading reviews of it the more I realized how many different age groups are completely in awe of this series. And for good reason too. There's action, there's love, it's awesome.
B003K15INU|5.0|Seeing that time of American upheaval so strongly, almost savagely portrayed was truly touching to me. I was in my late teens and twenties than. Though I was not primarily into the politics of the time, I remember it all to well.<br />Having Swede's perspective on not only his personal tragedy, but the Times as a whole,put me in mind of my own parents. It must have been a great confusion to the generation that had been through a world war and a depression.<br />This is a great thought provoking book.
B000R3NNDQ|5.0|This is a great and quick read, great ideas on change and leadership. How to build a team driving your vision to fruition.
B001HN6922|1.0|The product was supposed to be &#34;like new&#34; but it skips ALL the time.  I have to push the FF button and then it stops skipping.  Sometimes the sound goes out too and I have to push the FF button.  Definitely not &#34;like new!&#34;
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Well done. Interesting. Never got to know his wife before. Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren were fabulous. A friend of mine who doesn't like Scarlett Johansson<br />said he liked her in this. She made a fine Janet Leigh. Rest of cast was excellent as well. I'm tempted to buy the DVD after seeing it streaimg on Amazon, so I can watch again whenever I want.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The CG Tiger was beautiful but the whale was so obviously fake among other things.  And the movie was unrealistic it is more like a story of legend than reality.  Also, I searched online an the longest time I found of someone being lost at sea was 22-year-old Poon Lim's 133 days alone.  When I watch these types of films I often think about what it would be like to really be stuck in that situation but the movies was so unrealistic that it was almost a dream world than reality and nothing like what it would really be like.  Also, I wonder what people in India think of this film.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|As always a fantastic journey complete with many unexpected twists. I can not wait to start on the next one
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game!!! I play it multiple times a day! yay!<br />sometimes there are a few bugs (I.e. hearts disappearing), but I live for my MLP down time!
B0058SNI58|5.0|I am preganant and my feet and back where aching. I bought these shoes to wear to work. I absolutely love them! so comfortable and have really helped with the foot pain. If you are a half size I would go to the next smallest size. I am a 6.5 and ordered a 7 and they are a bit big..
B00000K2UX|5.0|I saw the movie, loved the songs partly because of the movie, and I grew up in the 80's. Some of the songs make very little sense out of context. Definitely a good buy for anyone obsessed with having the most popular 80's songs.
B008V2THJE|5.0|It's original and well done. If you like Paris and European Cinema you'll enjoy it. Have a box of kleenex by your side.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm only 10 and this game is really fun I guess I would call it tots coool. :) I had really fun playing it I saw my brothers playing it so I said I should really try it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Admittedly, I am a sucker for British drama and humour.  Yet biases asside, I find this series to be refreshingly orriginal and clever.<br /><br />If you'd like a change from the standard of weak writing of general television, give this one a shot.
B003LL3LHO|3.0|It's good to learn the story of the Guild Wars universe, but the characters just weren't that interesting, especially the main character. He would make decision that just make no sense for his character. Alright, but it could be passed on just as easily.
B009K916ZK|3.0|good , high quality, easy to use, clean and usefull, good , high quality, easy to use, clean and usefull,

B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app lights up my kindle fire like a flashlight with 7 \\" l.e.d.  beautifully designed and beautiful lights. THANK YOU!!
B0074VA2T2|5.0|Our granddaughter loves it.  Her Mom tells me it comes as a board game,too. She is 21/2. Years old.  She only needs a little prompting on occasion.  She is also learning her numbers at daycare.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Awesome wakes me up every time. Can't wait to upgrade and add music. Will be sure to recommend to all my friends and family.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is so cool. It's old fashioned with a modern twist. The 3D graphics are awesome with the basic pixelized ships. You should get this game because everybody can enjoy it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks brings forth feelings and emotions from his novels that we could never have known we had. Innocence and the sense of love within our deception of humanity brings to surface of the life stories we lie in bed late at night placing ourselves into. If ever there was a writer who could bend the ways of literature and come out the other side with a masterpiece, Nicholas Sparks would be who I'd place my bet on.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I cannot wait til the 3rd book comes out (published) in June...I was totally pissed when I found out that I have to wait that long to find out the ending...it's the third book for goodness sakes....I have to HAVE it!  ASAP....get this book out now!  DT's are setting in!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Simply the very best. I have played the Two previous games. This IS the very very best yet. Everyone must play this game...only if you love to play Great Games. Fly finally did it Right.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I love this show. I grew up watching it, and I am trying to acquire every season. I wish I had money for the box set.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|Force closes every time, rendering the alarm useless, one update fixed it, then another and it forgot how to do it again.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Definitely worth 5 stars!! so worth buying, I will probably watch it another 10 times or so to get all the action out of it.
B003Y5RLR8|5.0|If you love the King then you have to have this dvd. I shows him at his very best performing all the great hits and more.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|The singing (other than Crowe) was good, if syrupy. The message was sickening. Life is tough. How about trying to solve your problems constructively instead of whining about your pitiful situation. No, let's strike back instead, crush our oppressors so we can become the new oppressors ourselves. Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot - they are the wonderful \\"future\\" that awaits.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|With Scorsese as the director and George Harrison as the subject, this is one of the best rock documentaries that I have seen.  The content is fascinating, and the directing and music are fantastic.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very fitting conclusion to Hunger Games series.  I saw a message of survival and hope. The world isn't always pretty, but getting through the adversities, surviving and living to pass on the good parts of humanity can make a sacrifice a worhty thing.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I absolutely love this CD, and it instantly became a new favorite of mine.  The songs are fantastic, and the sound quality sounded great to me.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The book by Victor Hugo is on of the worlds classics and is my favorite.  The musical is one of the best movies ever made and is artistically brilliant and edited perfectly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I honestly just started playing the game but I really enjoy it so far. I have no problems, and no ads, like other games. I would recommend this to people of all ages
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very fun. Passes time. Wish more coins would come quicker. Very addicting. My two year old likes it too. Recommend it.
B004478AS4|4.0|I'm in the tenth grade and we have started to review African literature. My teacher gave us this book to read and comprehend the meaning behind it. I have given the book a solid 4 star because the naming in this book is quite confusing, however, the way the three parts of the stories are intertwined is fascinating. A clear and clever way to describe Nigerian culture is all wrapped into one book. Chinua Achebe has certainly achieved greatness with this novel.
B007HACDLK|4.0|It's been a long time since I have been unable to put a book down. I love the intrigue and the plots with a twist.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Fun game! Took awhile to learn to time foods/maximize counter space. I burned a few things till I got that sorted out, LOL  It's fun to make new dishes, move the items in the restaurant, upgrade & change decor. Interaction with your &#34;Neighbors&#34; is integral to reaching goals.<br /><br />Never thought I would enjoy a game like this, but it's a lot a fun
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|As much as I love the idea of watching this on almost anywhere and on almost anything. I'd prefer for it to load all most like the youtube fashion . Because I really want to watch it in HD instead of regular
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book has really helped our marriage. I read this to make my wife happy but couldn't put it down. I love knowing what my love language is and how I can help my wife. It is easy to read and understand. Thank you, Dr Chapman!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Nice bit of story and timer challenge.  Boards and obstacles very much like the Atlantis themed games, with different music and less insistent<br />count down timer this flavor match three game is more relaxing than most.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Whole lot of fun and worth it. A very time consumeing game  But keep track of how much money u put in to it.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Lovely voice, creative guitarist, interesting lyricist...and eye candy!<br /><br />I hope she goes as far as her potential seems to indicate.
B008HTQ28K|5.0|Definitely worth the end. Kept me busy. Would make a great movie! A very complex plot of lies, deceit and corruption from all concerned.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy this game and have not spent a dime on it and I am at level 36 or so!!
B0094K1JPC|4.0|Good chick flick for a Friday evening. Looking forward to more of these cute movies. Enjoy watching it on my Kindle Fire.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Refreshing , a great story and reminder of how far we have come, how things have changed.<br />Costumes are great
B005JE7WKI|5.0|By far the best movie I've seen in some time.  If you like dark comedy, horror movies, and a pretty girl or two rent this movie now.  Don't think about it just rent it you won't be disappointed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I never wanted this book to end!!! I would absolutely recomend it to anyone who has a love for science fiction! VERY GOOD!!!
B003DZX3SA|4.0|I like the movie, I just wish it was the original cut. 'Human Again' changes the tone of the movie for the worse.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child is a master at sustaining intense interest in his novels. I'm not good at sitting down and reading a book cover to cover. Consequently, it becomes necessary for me to return to the book often and I find it easy to pass other things needing my attention to get back to the story. I love the writing skill of Mr. Child and after reading several Jack Reacher stories I am anxious to read another. We saw the Reacher movie, liked it and now I expect to read as many books about his adventure as I can at age 86.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|One of the best an  most entertaining games on kindle. It's fun enough to last days without getting bored. The best part is you can continue the game without having to buy items. Recommend.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I've been fascinated by Abraham Lincoln my entire life. I'm sure it has to do with the fact that he was assassinated and there's quite a bit of mystery and intrigue surrounding his presidency and personal life. He did so much in his terms in office and changed our nation for the better while overcoming all sorts of political opposition. I knew I would need to see Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" as soon as it was announced in production.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" focuses on the man's obsession with getting the 13th Amendment pushed through Congress before the Civil War ended. Abe was honest, but would see his mission of obliterating slavery accomplished by any means necessary. His drive and the toll it took on his family life are explored in great detail.<br /><br />Director Steven Spielberg takes what could have been a disastrously boring two and a half hours of non-stop dialogue and somehow makes it engaging and tolerable. The success of the film is based around Spielberg's casting of Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role. Day-Lewis owns every moment he's on screen and demands your attention with every word he speaks. He's merely the cherry on top of a brilliant and dedicated cast that includes James Spader, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Fields, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, David Strathairn, and many more.<br /><br />Although they only took up a few moments of screen time, the scenes of the Civil War battlefields bore a lasting impression on me. The savageness of hand-to-hand combat was hard to watch. These soldiers fought hand-to-hand, which made it more personal. It wasn't a faceless war like today's, where we just drop bombs on each other and never have direct contact with the people we're fighting.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln's\\" high-definition audio and video transfer couldn't be any better. The picture gives viewers the best visual experience possible and highlights the extravagant set and costume designs. The 7.1 surround sound guarantees every uttered piece of dialogue, whispered or shouted, is heard over John Williams' incredible score. The battle scene is effectively chaotic, noisy, and nerve-wracking as well.<br /><br />There are two short featurettes included in the 2-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack. Steven Spielberg and his team of filmmakers discuss the shooting location and making of the film in \\"The Journey to 'Lincoln'\\" and \\"A Historic Tapestry: Richmond, Virginia.\\" They both clock in at about 13 minutes combined.<br /><br />The fact that I stayed awake through two and a half hours of talking is a true testament of how well-paced and captivating \\"Lincoln\\" is. I'm really not one for talky and long-winded movies, but Spielberg's devoted obsession with the historical figure and Janusz Kaminski's masterful cinematography make the movie stand out and demand your undivided attention. It's a movie that requires multiple viewings, as there is so much being said so quickly that you're guaranteed to miss something important.ed or shouted, is heard over John Williams' incredible score.

141659521X|4.0|Avid Vince Flynn reader, and loved, loved, loved this book!  Mitch getting hurt was a neat little twist, and having other characters take over a little bit, even better!  Now, please, somebody please get their act together and make the movies.  Geesh.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutley love this game... it uses allot of battery though...amazing graphics and its so much fun to play. all of the fun new challenges and amazing horses.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|our girls loved this movie and, as a parent along for the ride, so did I.  It had a good pace and humor.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Interesting read. I loved reading about a scientist finding God. The frequent scientific and medical terms proved more boring than informational though.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Worth watching if you like season's 1 and 2, but some of the major plot points felt a bit forced.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|I completely loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I can and have watched it several times.  I expected some of the same here but with a different story.  I was kinda disappointed.  The story was good I felt the action was spread out enough its was the way they did the action that I didnt like.  I love how in the LOTR the orc were people in costume and you could tell that a lot of effort was put into the fight scenes and the creation of the monsters.  Here it seems as though the only one that they put effort into was Smegal.  The other characters are overdone with CGI.  If they would go back to the way they shot LOTR they would be fine.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We have watched this movie about 5 times now. It is very very cool.<br />A good story line with an awesome ending!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I watched this movie at least 8 times when it was in theatres and I never got tired of it. Action, comedy, love, friendship - this movie has it all! I find it to be the perfect movie!! I highly recommend it!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book is so beautifully written, it's message so simple but yet profound. I'm reading it for the second time again.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|At the core, it's a predictable story line. But the visuals and character designs help keep it fun. I appreciated the references to classic video games, and a couple easter eggs hidden in the backgrounds.
B00821OX98|1.0|Incredibly boring.  I had so much hope for this show.  I like Noah Wyle, but there's simply nothing interesting about this survival story.  The only compelling character is the one played by Noah Wyle.
B00846WWVM|3.0|This isn't a bad game, but it would be a lot better on the Wii or Nintendo DS, something with buttons in addition to touch/motion controls. Changing the height of the watergun is fine, but aiming is touchy--you need to be touching a certain distance away, otherwise it will adjust the tower's height or just do nothing instead. This means that most of the challenge of the game is wrestling with the controls. Also, the physics are inconsistent in some levels, making them much harder than they should be.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|A great film from beginning to end. It was funny and also heartwarming. I am very much looking forward to the sequel.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|Warning: Though I try not to include spoilers in any of my reviews, this is a sequel and may contain some spoilers from the first in the series.<br /><br />  At a Glance: This is the sequel to Lauren Oliver's wildly popular book, Delirium, about a dystopian society which has outlawed love and gone to great lengths to eradicate the emotion through risky surgical procedures and harsh punishment. When we last saw our heroine, Lena, she had contracted the Amore Deliria (love) and, with the help of her boyfriend Alex, had attempted a daring escape to the wilds. One made it, the other did not.<br /><br />  But, life goes on. Lauren Oliver gives us a peek inside the everyday life of the invalids (those who were born beyond or escaped to the unregulated areas beyond the city borders). And it ain't pretty.<br /><br />  The Good: Oliver is a very talented writer. She doesn't dumb down her material just because her target audience isn't old enough to vote. Some of the scenes in Pandemonium are dark and depressing, which is perfect for such a disconnected, emotionless world.<br /><br />  The best part is that we get to see Lena (the previously whiney, wimpy, goody-two-shoes) grow a spine (and maybe a couple of cojones). This was my greatest hope for the sequel since I found Lena to be slightly annoying in the first book.<br /><br />  The Bad: In my humble opinion, the characters are the driving force behind a great read. There has to at least one outstanding personality in order for a story to leave a lasting impression. Unfortunately, all of the characters in Pandemonium are utterly forgettable. We get to know Lena pretty well since the story is told from her POV but, unlike the first book, I didn't feel the reality of her emotion.<br />The Bottom Line: While lacking in some important areas Pandemonium is still a fantastic story. I wish that Lauren Oliver would find some balance between her plot and characters. As with Delirium, she sacrificed one for the sake of the other andit was disappointing.<br /><br />FYI: I also listened to the audio version of Pandemonium (narrated by Sarah Drew). It. Was. Awful. I would give the audio book one star. (Yeah. That bad.)
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It runs glitch free.  I like the effects.  They make it challenging.  I was able to finish it in a few weeks in my spare  time.
B002Z8IWMS|4.0|I've been doing presentations, within the last 6 years. They are technical prsemtations (lean manufacturing).<br /><br />The tips (villans, tweters, etc) were very good. Definetly, I'll change the way I plan my presentations.
B008RJFRTK|3.0|For the most part I like the app.  But some of the smaller towns I cannot search.  They show up on the map but they cannot be searched.  Also I try to use the app in the car.  The contrast on the map is low so I have to run a higher intensity on the app and that drains batteries more.  But the map is very detailed and from what I can tell is very accurate.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|Unsuspecting movies about life that is uplifting on how friendships can change your life. Based on a true story this movie is funny,sad and uplifting.
B007N85POS|5.0|How can I rate this high enough!? My grandson is 2 1/2 and he plays better than me! He just goes from level to level he loves it!
B000QCTNIW|5.0|this book was a great encouragement to me because it shows how resilient the brain is and gives me hope.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I often will not purchase an app when an adequate substitute is available. The Merriam-Webster dictionary is that rare exception. This product is the standard bearer of American English dictionary's. It would prove useful if one has a need for a dictionary. The fact that it can be used offline is an even better.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Works great able to recharge my Iphone about 3 times along with my Bluetooth ear piece . It does take a long time to recharge battery pack but no big deal plug it in at night before bed and it's fully charged in the morning and ready to go for a couple of days.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I keep waiting for this book to end. Usually I'm sad when a book ends. It's like loosing a friend. I don't like the people.
B005R32L66|5.0|I use it daily.I contact my grandson thats a marine and stationed in japan. I love being able to see and speak with him at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like playing and so does my five year old. I like the other players you can choose from and the daily challenges.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|This Movie Was Pretty Good Except It Lacked Something. Oh Yeah More Trolls. Pretty Long And Drawn Out For Most of It. The Scenes With The Trolls Were Exceptional. I Wouldn't Spend a Lot of Money On It But Worth Checking Out.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|I love martial arts films and this one is top of the line. I enjoyed it from start to finish!
B005DD7H50|4.0|Racy action stuff! Good flight movie. I liked it! Amazing acting by Bradley Cooper. What are there 3 more words required.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|Attempted to purchase and Amazon indicated this was already in my library . I checked . It wasn't . I  rented the unrated version instead. I was charged for both.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I sat there after the end of the movie and tried to figure out why every review I had read about it gave it a great review. This is a bad movie. Compared to the first two movies in the series, this is a total let down. It was like the writer of the first two movies had written himself into a corner with the ending of the dark knight and had no idea how to get himself out so just threw explosions at the screen and hoped no one would notice how bad a movie dark knight rises is. Watch the first two movies in the series and then watch this movie, then see if you can defend Dark Knight Rises as a great movie. This is as bad as Batman and Robin and I will not add it to my movie collection.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|And you thought a soap opera wouldn't appeal to the intelligentsia! As entertainment, could this possibly be improved upon? I don't think so. Every scene is a fascinating little play.
0811875555|5.0|Each page is just a masterpiece after another. The concept designs are incredibly detailed, and the character pages are diverse in expression and are a delight to gawk at for long periods of time. I'd recommend this book for anyone aspiring to become a conceptual artist or animator as Glen Keane's work is exhibited and is one of the best in his field.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|Excellent performances all around, but couldn't we have Joaquin in a comedy once?  The lead characters are so troubled, it's hard to watch.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Loved this movie! It was very funny and cute and not necessarily your standard Disney movie with a princess who has to be paired off with a prince. In fact, I loved that it was more about Princess Merida being true to herself while understanding tradition and developing a more loving relationship with her mother. I would recommend for a pre-teen, but the young kids would find the bear villain to be a little scary.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|It's just the best!! And as the child of the greatest entertainer in history, could Liza Minnelli have proven her own  genius more spectacularly?  Watch Joel Gray carefully--what a performance!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Loved how her message was a unifying one and a call to women that our journey isn't over. Definitely recommended reading for any women.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  It's a quick read because I couldn't put it down. Very heart warming. I loved the ending! I would recommend this book to everyone any age.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one show that I can never figure out what is going to happen. It constantly surprises me. Top notch acting and production values
B001223BLU|5.0|After seeing Jersey Boys - and loving the show - my husband and I realized that we didn't have these classics in our collection.  The Jersey Boys soundtrack is fun but there's nothing like the originals!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. I will definitely be purchasing the others. I have highly recommended this book to many of my family and friends.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a surprising addictive game! I play at Pogo alot and this game reminds me of their \\"Sweet Tooth\\" game... but more fun as there are obstacles to clearing the board. I wish they'd make more games like this. It's a nice departure from the Hidden Object games which I love and can't get enough of.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book had me from book one chapter one. I immensely enjoyed reading the trilogy and recommend it to anyone that enjoys action and love.
145162607X|4.0|Despite being an avid fan of Gregory, I found the Cousins' War to be a little lacking. White Queen was ok and the Red Queen was awful, but this book in the series has more of the charm and excitement that I appreciate in Gregory's writing. So if you're a Gregory fan, you'll like this particular novel.<br /><br />Queen's Fool is still #1 in my heart :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a ton of fun for kids and adults alike.  From 3 years old to 66, i've seen enjoy this game.  It's fun and can be challenging too!.
B002M87V0A|5.0|The movie is a joy to watch. It's very good for children in the 6-9 age range, as they begin to get the humor and they can learn a lot about life in a small Midwest town in 1912. The music is wonderful and fun.
B000FA675C|1.0|Excellent talent misused. One day, everyone, will spend time with one or another personage - a long time...and it would be good to enjoy the company of the One or the other and I suspect the author will not be comfortable with either.
B000FC130E|5.0|I was enthralled by every Gaiman book I have previously read. This book also enchanted and enthralled. If you liked The Night Circus you will love this delightful book.
B002KGEORM|5.0|The whole series so far is well written. It has it all.....heroes.... villains....classic retro father-son conflicts.....a Mother that would kill for her son (very Grecian)....well chosen characters....the list goes on. Makes me want to go out and buy a Harley Davidson and &#34; get in the wind&#34;. Where did I put my leathers? Never missed an episode yet ! Can't wait for the next season to begin.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|The movie was wonderful, funny and colorful.  I played it at a restaurant for my grandchildren (ages 4 and 10)when we found out the food will be over an hour to get.  It kept them entertained the whole time.  I found the movie so funny and very interesting with a lot of action. We got to see the whole movie by the time dinner was over.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Beautiful, I couldn't put it down . Fell in love with the characters,and the surprises just kept coming. Thank you Kate Morton .
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept my interest and I would recommend it to others!  I didn't figure out the ending, which is the sign of a good mystery for me!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Cool plot, poor writing. Some parts were too far fetched to even take seriously. And Ana just got on my nerves
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Unlike some reviewers, I enjoyed Argo and there were several times it had me holding my breath while sitting on the edge of my chair.  Yes, it is based on a true story with Hollywood fiction thrown in to make it more sensational but unlike a documentary based on facts, \\"based on a true story\\" is just that - loose with the truth.  I thought the acting was commendable and Ben Affleck was very good in his dual role as actor and director.  I could see it again and also recommend it to others.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|626 people gave it 5 stars that's why i bought it, but i'm returning it to join the 28 who gave it 1 star cause it would not stand.  I might have gotten a faulty one cause 626 people cannot be so far from the truth.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|It was a great cd.  I love listening to it each time I am in the car.  Her voice is so smooth.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|It's a dvd, what more is there to say?  The movie is in 2 parts on 2 separate dvds.  It is easier to use the digital version to<br />use on ultra-violet and it lets you also use a version for Amazon, this way you only have to put the dvd in for the extras, and don't<br />have to change dvd's half way through the movie.
B002ZG997C|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie with the big suprise.  You really have to watch it and pay attention.
B0036OODFU|5.0|It is the innocence amongst the squalor, when music and lust and chasing the dream drove bands -- and the girls who loved them. Long before name brand-checking, business people worried about back-ends and music vetted by committee, there was a Garden of Eden period for rock & roll.<br />It was during that time that Cameron Crowe became ROLLING STONE's youngest writer. And in &#34;Almost Famous,&#34; William Miller shows us the things that the Oscar-winning director/screenwriter saw. The struggle, the patched together nature of scratching at the ceiling of success, the business that is necessary and the glory of that moment of breaking through are all here, as well as misassigned loves, romances that're more about the moment than the heart and how one great romantic's broken heart causes a reckoning for the hero, the writer and the girl herself.<br />Some of the greatest lines about life and rock & roll ever delivered. Some of the sweetest undercurrent points that would be overlooked by most. Some of the hope that makes rock music more than sheer nihilism. Completely worth watching, if only to understand why once upon a time this music mattered so much.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Sherlock Holmes one of my favorite.  We really enjoyed thos movie as we do all the Sherlock Holmes movies.  Recommend it if you like Sherlock Holmes..
B0027MJU00|5.0|If you love a &#34;what really happened?&#34; this is a good one.  Everyone seems to have an opinion about what happened during a multiple family member murder on a farm that was quickly falling apart.  I did not find the main character to be very likable in the begining.  By the end, I was more sorry for what she lost and rooting for her to find the truth.  It all becomes very clear in the end.  You will enjoy this book.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|We loved it, would not recommend it to any children, it had some pretty bad parts not for kids.  My husband and I love it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|If you found yourself wondering what in the world kind of childhood could produce an adult like Salander, here's your answer.  I loved reading her history and what made her tick.  This book is about her and her warped father.  She's still full of surprises.  Filled with the dramatic and a wonderful action ending.  Of course the playboy reporter is back, bringing all the sexual tension.  This was even better than the first book.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I myself did not watch, but grandchildren gave it a thumbs up.<br />How many words let me count the ways.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A pointed look into alcoholism and drug addition as a coping mechanism; overall a bit depressing as Denzel ends up doing the right thing, which costs him is job/family/friends/etc.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|this was an awesome concert. well recorded. the sound is even throughtout the disc. when i dim the lights and crank up the home theater system , it feels like i am at a live performance.
B0059DQHHI|4.0|I didn't know the plot of this film, so for a while I couldn't figure the direction it was going.  It surpised me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I like the game a lot after playing it for 5 hours... My 9 year old daughter also likes it... Music is ok and i actually like classical music... but in midi form... it isn't quite as pleasing.  Good game... definitely worth the price.
B005OMOKN2|4.0|Good to have two of this if you plan to record video, as the camera will drain the battery real fast; payed half the price because it was on sale, if not is overpriced
B00A8OWOSO|5.0|Great gangster flick with great actors.  Darkly funny, sexy and not overly violent.  The failed hit on Albert Finney is awesome!  John Turturro is such a scum bag in this movie.  Love it!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It seemed too much like a dictionary. I would suggest this to any one that has a Kindle Fire Hd.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a great movie! I would watch it over and over again..I am waiting for another..Avatar will be good when the new one comes out
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This is a low cost steady-cam alternative enables various rig set-ups and shot angles and light easy movement for following subjects.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|I wish this product would have had a pocket or space for my stylus because I don't use the stylus for any other reason.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I have been a fan of ghost/hanted house horror movies for 50 years and Sinister is one of the scariest and most disturbing films I have ever seen.  From the reviews, you know that the protagonist finds several 8 mm films in the attic of the murder house in which he has just moved his family.  The titles on the film cannisters alone give you a shudder because you KNOW what will be on the movie: \\"Hanging Aound\\" (the opening credits have already shown the hanging of 4 people), \\"Pool Party\\" and (worst) \\"Barbeque\\".  The night scenes are brilliantly shot with just enough light to make you feel you are in the house with Elliot.  As the movie progresses, the clues pile up but you will never guess the ending.  The musical score is moody and sets the tone for the whole movie. I couldn't get it out of my head and I still see some of the scariest scenes in my mind's eye.  This is a must see for any horror fan.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read that kept my interest.  Shows how different the news media will spin a story. This makes me proud of all our military service men and women.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is beter then temple run. I love the girl tricky. The mystery box is my favrote part. I love it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Yes I can watch it again, and again and STILL find new things each time. There is so much detail in this and the story-telling is superb. I don't want to give away very much at all, but this movie is amazing! Not safe for the eyes of children though, it is definately teen - adult as it can get violent at times. Even people who don't like anime will love this movie, which also has a deep message.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|I liked this movie.  It was cute, cartoon like, while providing the message that we have screwed up this planet because of our waste.  Good message to be sending out.
B00BESCJII|4.0|This is a great movie. But it is definitely a very mature story. I would not have anyone younger than high school age watch this movie, even with parents. There are several mature story themes. Even though the movie has a lot of funny elements, it has an overall very serious story theme.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great movie! Very suspenseful! Can understand why it was rated best picture! Ben Affleck was very good in this movie.
B0099114WO|4.0|Entertaining - will strike a chord with those married awhile.  Some very good advice given on how to keep a marriage alive.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It's a classic, so might has well have one of these on your iPad for the long layovers in the winter while traveling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you get this game you will be sooo happy when I played it I was screaming everybody this game will make you addicted to playing nothing but subway surf
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a book that people seem to either love or hate.  If you remain focused on the sexual issues/details in the book you could really get tired of it because there is a lot of sex in the book but there are so many other dynamics about the characters that really intrigued me. It keep my interest and was well written to the point now where I really felt I had come to know Christian, Ana and everyone else.<br /><br />There was a serious overuse of the F@#% word that I thought was beyond necessary, however, I was able to move past this and in the end was so glad that I gave book 2 a fair chance.<br /><br />A good read indeed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a twisted, crazy, sick, wonderful, who-would-have-figured novel! Had been meaning to read it for awhile, and sure glad I did.  Crazy from beginning to end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not wait to get started in the third and last book in this series.  I enjoyed the drama, the depth of this intense love between two people.  It was a nice progression and finish to a very captivating book.  I found that I dreaded finishing the book because I had grown quite fond of the characters.<br /><br />This book, this series is not for the 'easily offended,'  If you read it with the knowing that it is probably going to offend you, then it will live up to your expectations.  If you read it with an open mind and choose to move past being offended, if that happens, then I think you will enjoy this trilogy very much.  I sure did.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i like it its very cool and the dragons get bigger and bigger also the dragon's baby's  are so cute
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|It is a very different and beautifully filmed piece. It makes you think a long time after you see it. The filming was outstanding.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Wasn't sure I'd like it - but I'm hooked.  Recommend to anyone that likes not only Kevin Bacon but serial killer stories!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and intertaning I love the tragical and the diffacultyit gets to after so long after starting the game id regimens this to all of my friends and family
B004J4X73K|5.0|What a wonderful book to tie all the others together!  Each book in the Nightrunner Series surpasses the previous title, an amazing feat by an amazingly talents and gifted author!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|it is the greatest show I have ever seen on television.every character is real and amazing,i hope it goes on forever.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am very pleased with this USB cable. I plug my Kindle in and charge it with no problems. Also it can be used to tranfer data from my computer to my Kindle.
B006OB3K56|1.0|This movie had no story line, we thought it would never end - and it was nothing short of porn.  Michael Fassbender is literally screwing every woman (and a man) in sight, masterbating where ever he can find a place (i.e., at work) and if he's not busy doing that he's watching women masterbate online.  His sister is just as screwed up as he is and even stands naked in front of him for minutes while they have a conversation.  Just a weird, sick, twisted movie that I wish I never bought.  I plan on throwing it in the garbage.  Don't waste your money on this movie.
B0027V6AL8|5.0|This movie still rates five stars for a whole new generation. We were sad that the movie was not available for streaming as we really did not need to own it.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this ap could be made vocal.  I spent a good amount of time inputing my notes only to find that I could listen to what I had written.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very nice app, i am using it on my kindle fire for around a year now. Highly recommend to install. Great job guys!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Excellent graphics.  Can choose between hidden object game and fun domino game each time.  Uses logic but hints are available.  Nice map feature.  Interesting story line.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|TOO DEPRESSING!  WANTED TO FINISH TO FIND OUT HOW IT ENDED BUT REALLY WOULDNT RECOMMEND  FIRST BOOK I READ OF HERS!
B000TENHWA|4.0|This band has a good varity of music. I really enjoy them. Never gave them a listen before my wife sent me one of thier youtubes.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Matt Smith has been my favorite doctor.<br />There a few great episodes for Tennent. The story lines with Smith have been consistently better.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|A match 3 game with good graphics and a neat storyline.  I liked that based on my time I could earn from 1-3 stars for each &quot;day&quot; and could redo to try to improve my time. As you progress each layout becomes a bit more challenging. Of course this just made me more determined to get the 3 star rating. Once I started I didn't want to stop until I completed my 80 day trip.  This was a terrific free app of the day and worth the regular price as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great classic solitaire game ads are a bit of a pain but not too bad no problems to report def. recommend
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Everyone in this movie did an amazing job... they were all incredible.  I think the story was just kind of strange.  It started in seemingly one direction, then turned and the focus was on another story, then came back. There was a moment where I thought I had missed a few minutes of the movie and rewound it, only to find that I hadn't missed anything... that's just how the story flowed.  It was interesting, kept my attention, but just kind of left me wanting.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This a great book that is about a true American hero and what he went thought in the war. Amazing, this book really tells you what was happening over there instead of the media's BS.
6305433909|5.0|while i am not nomally a whoopi fan, she did a great job in this movie.  lots of good music and fun
B00BWJ6JO4|1.0|I liked this movie it self, but the video jumped around and missed scenes. It would go all pixilated and then no sound would come out while the movie was still going.
1878424319|1.0|Received two books in a timely manor but both books have pages that are upside down. What happent to product control?
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game loaded fairly fast and I highly recommend it to people who love ghosts and mystery.<br />I bet you will be playing it for hours!!!
B00000J0O2|1.0|I thought I was getting a good deal on a genuine HP toner cartridge.  It appeared to be the real thing, however, the print quality was suspect...gray and streaky, blank spots and some pages had only faint gray marks.  Printed 30 pages, and not one clear image in the bunch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it love it love it I cant take my damn eyes off the damn.. game love,.......18years Old..............  :):):):):)love it
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I like it very much, so much eaiser than keeping notes in my pockets or purse, its perfect for a grocery list. Thank you.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Nice, easy-going, entertaining read and with some interesting behind-the-scenes info from the comedy industry. Appreciated Fey's perspective regarding women in a male-dominated industry.
B00AR3WD8W|3.0|1973's \\"Aloha from Hawaii\\" special holds a somewhat erratic place in Presley history; the legend surrounding the event, including being the most widely view world televised broadcast in history at the time, makes it seem like it was an indeed one of Presley's towering performances. However, ignoring its technical accomplishments, the show itself is now seen as lackluster compared to the Presley of 1970 or even 1972.<br /><br />\\"Aloha\\" is where you could truly draw a line between Presley the untouchable legend and the grotesque self parody he became for the last four years of his life. Coming off the major professional successes of his MSG stints in June of 1972, the Golden Globe winning \\"Elvis on Tour,\\" and the smash hit single \\"Burning Love,\\" Elvis should've felt energized and inspired for such a massive event. However, physical and personal problems stemming from his divorce from Priscilla had begun to take their toll; upon meeting with director Marty Pasetta, the bloated, pale 37 year old star was ordered to get into shape for the special. He managed to slim down to his svelte 1969-70 frame, but did so lazily by going on a bizarre crash diet that left him looking damn good but without the extra light in his eyes that he had in his heyday. Vocally, he sounded nasal and flat, and even when he goes for the more challenging notes on \\"What Now, My Love\\" and \\"An American Trilogy,\\" they don't have the same power they had in 1970 or even 1972. Legendary hit singles like \\"Hound Dog,\\" \\"Blue Suede Shoes,\\" \\"Suspicious Minds,\\" and even the most recent \\"Burning Love\\" are tossed off like items on a shopping list.<br /><br />The 40th anniversary legacy edition features the original 1973 broadcast as the well January 12th rehearsal show, plus the five songs he recorded after the special at three in the morning. The sound on both shows is very good, although they don't have the same richness as previous 'Legacy' releases. The accompanying packaging is attractive, but none of this does anything to improve upon how subpar as a whole the \\"Aloha\\" performance was.does anything to improve upon how subpar as a whole the \\"Aloha\\" performance was.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Bought this for my wife's new small form factor computer.  All she does is surf the internet and write papers, with some occasional Sims 3 tossed in.  This CPU does all that and more, might even have been overkill for her.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This was one of my best reads in a long time! Did not want to put it down as it is a nail biter. The characters and little details make it so enthralling and kept me trying to figure out what really happened to Christine. Amazing!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great episode as always worth watching if you missed it on AMC.  Good suspense, good video quality, definitely check it out.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|I ordered this for my son at Christmas time and paid $123.00 for it.  I always buy him a nice lego set at Christmas and they are usually over $100.  When I got it and it was so tiny and pathedic I was disappointed that I was charged $123.00 (plus shipping).  I emailed The Toy Giant and asked about returning.  They emailed the address for me to ship to for a return and mentioned that it was not over priced, this was the &#34;hottest item&#34; right now and it is sold out everywhere.  I received it no problem, guess I was a lucky one because I had been looking at it for over a week before I decided to purchase it!  I didnt end up returning it because after Christmas I decided I would keep for my sons bday in April and just accept the fact that I was ripped off.  I just found this &#34;hot item&#34; on Amazon for $51.00 new!  So, in a matter of 3 months this &#34;hot item&#34; price dropped by over 60%!  That is not the way it works with Legos....they stay around the same expensive price....I have been buying them for my boys for 15 years.  Star wars legos are still expensive.  They ripped families off at Christmas time by price gouging their Mine Craft Lego tiny set.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Even though she has made some facial changes she still looks fantastic.Seeing her in this movie really makes her look better than usual.The story line was great.Helen plays the part very well.A got to see movie if your a Helen Hunt fan.Thank you for such great service.The movie came faster than I thought that it would.I was very pleased.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Still cannot believe Tom Cruise thinks he can play Reacher. What a waste of a great character. Going to download the next one now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is pretty good. I enjoy trying these little games when I have some spare time. quite a nice variety too. challenging in some and others are simple.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Well I've used it once .....but it worked good so far I for sure will be using it in the future.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Tremendous unrealized potential!<br />This movie could have been quite good with the wealth of material on the subject. Main actors made the most of a weak script.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|This was a soulless, labored and chaotic mess of incoherent noise from start to finish with Bruce looking and acting like he was half senile for it's entire running time. Badly written, badly shot, badly directed, badly acted and uninspired.<br /><br />Sure it had a lot of action but so what? None of that matters if the story and characters around it makes no sense and it's obvious that the actors are sleepwalking through it. I saw it as part of an all day DH marathon the day before it opened at my local theater and if I knew then what I know now I would have left after the fourth film.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the directors rather ballsy decision to break two DH traditions by cutting it's running time down to under two hours and framing it at an unforgivable 1.85:1.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Very disappointed in this cd from Justin! The intro and outro are too long. The songs are just not the great, I expected way more from Justin! His future/sex cd was awesome! I just hope the concert is a lot better.
B000ZM7VVO|5.0|It is a great album and I  love to have it on my playlist.I hope you get this album yourself.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Nuff said because their is really nothing u can say about a book as awesome as this Rick Riordan proved he still got it
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|Very eye opening and inspiring, held my attention and made me think about the universe we reside in. no words can describe what pictures mean and this movie took that to a whole new level.
1476719071|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It bypassed time when I didn't have anything else to do.  I have to admit that when reading the book there were several pages throughout the book that would throw me off.  The author made certain pages very difficult to read at times making me have to read pages over two or three times to understand where she was going with that chapter.  It was very confusing.  I did enjoy reading the book and have ordered the second because I do enjoy reading.  I would recommend it, but it wouldn't be on my top to recommend.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|I am never bored with this show.  Very intriguing and exciting.  I am always surprised with every episode and can't wait for the next one.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|GREAT RENTAL PRICE.  THE MOVIE QUALITY WAS GREAT AND EASY TO RENT FROM AMAZON PRIME.  THIS IS AN EXTREMLY FUNNY MOVIE AND A GREAT RENTAL VALUE
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Another season of great British wit! It is like a great soap opera with a broad variety in the cast to follow.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The prose was very simple and direct.  The story was intriguing.  The book was almost impossible for me to put down.  It was a very good read.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Lots of twists and turns to keep you engaged in the story and the characters. Interesting line of thought regarding marriage and relationships.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|This is a songbook, not an album.  The songs meld beautifully into each other and yet each is unique.  Best I have heard in a very very long time.  Can't stop listening to it!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I would have enjoyed the Hobbit if I could of downloaded it, but the streaming is to slow to accompany the product, so I lost my cash and the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series and I got these to share with family and friends.  I would highly recommend this series.

159668139X|5.0|The book helped me very much in understanding the process of weaving.  I'm very glad that I purchased the book.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's great to have this at hand to quickly check the weather for my area or other favorites.  It was easy to enter additional zip codes so I can check my home or the home of a relative/friend.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I really live this movie and I have had the DVD for a long time and then it disappeared so I didn't think twice about ordering it again, I really love this movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had seen some of the series on T.V. but could'nt commit to watching it.<br />When my daughter gave me season one, I convinced my wife to join me in setting up an  evening to see if we could get into it..<br />We watched all seven programs in a couple days.<br />Like a good novel we immediately wanted the experience to go on.<br />I ordered season two that evening.<br />The series is so good on so many levels.<br />The character development, writing, cinematography etc.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I loved this movie . The story line stayed in tune with the book. I am 52 years old and I was surprised that I would like the movies so much, that I would go back and enjoy the books just as much.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|ive waited about a month  I have it on all of my devices my laptop and desktop I'm using it daily to keep random find I find that I don't want to lose or forget. this is easily the best app I own make sure you get all the available accessories. it will simplify your life... I promise. I use this everyday, it saves me time and it also makes sure my memory for decorating. and gardening ideas are saved in a reliable way. this is the most used app and accessory app that I use. the single con to this app is that using mobile devices we cant use the web site puller(cant remember the name of the actual app but it is an Evernote product) so that i could keep the webpages instead. of copying the words on the website and pasting it onto my notebook. I would think every adult who has a busy life to get this app and accessory apps. even teenagers could use this as a diary. k have a samsung 3 and its never once acted up. give it a month and check it out<br />you wont be disappointed
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|I loved the added scenes. It made it seem more like the book. I'm glad they added them back in. I think it made the follow of the movie better. I don't know why they left them out in the first place.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Fabulous production of a beautiful and introspective story.  The creation of the animatronic tiger is nothing less than technically phenomenal!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really cool game other than it has you buy new levels!!!!!!!!!!<br />You should really get this game and you don't have to pay for anything
B00BSBY38A|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.  It is a very emotional movie, the scenes are amazing. Strongly recommended!
B005K17RU0|1.0|This was a terrible update.  New version is one star.  Previous version was five star.  I don't understand why you would change a good app.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I started watching Season One of GAMES OF THRONES and was immediately hooked. I watched the entire season in a weekend. I could not get enough of this medieval fantasy saga. \\"Sprawling\\" is the key word here. GAME OF THRONES is a story of immense proportions with a rich and intriguing cast. Have a scorecard handy to keep track of all the characters and how they inter-relate. The Starks collide with the ruling Lannister family while the Dothrakis find a new princess.<br /><br />Visually stunning and a virtual visual effects feast, GAME OF THRONES is like nothing on TV. Here is a lavish production that outshines most anything in movie theaters. George R.R. Martin's story can be done justice in an ongoing TV series rather than compacted into a movie. So many worlds collide that we are often jolted from one location to another. Dark times are coming for the the 7 Kingdoms - political intrigues, the looming dark winter to come and the mysterious forces lurking in the woods will change life forever.<br /><br />GAME OF THRONES does have a fair amount of violence and sex and nudity but they all seem to fit into the telling of the story. The violence can be shocking since it can be unexpected. The show is not for the squeamish but there is an amazing story to tell here. Things really get going the last 3 episodes as the fight for the future of the kingdoms goes into full force.<br /><br />GAME OF THRONES is an amazing journey into fantasy and reality.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|Great Movie--Along with Breakfast Club and 16 Candles--Right up there with Ferris Bueller's Day Off--It certainly made Molly Ringwald a star--
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Another stellar session! Season 2 was just as brilliant as Season 1 and I ended up watching the whole season in two days.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Very pleased with purchase.  Delivered promptly with no problems at all.  Haven't watched it yet but looking forward to it.  I am a big fan of Walmart!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|fun game and rather spooky and original.  fun and also challenging. overall a great hidden object romp inna weird town.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really really love this game its better than temple run because you don't have to tilt to catch coins and other things
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't wait for season 3 to be on prime! Great characters, great story, lots of unexpected twists and turns.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie focuses on the pitfalls of life at 40, and it seems like the writer didn't miss any of them (spouses' annoying habits, teens, in-laws, bills, body changes, mammograms, no sex, late pregnancy, problems at work, etc). There are a few light moments, very few. It worked better in Knocked Up because there was a clear contrast between the got-it-together but unhappy sister and the happy but living-one-day-at-a-time sister. No contrasts in this one - everyone is unhappy. After 90 minutes of arguing, there is a sudden declaration that everything will be just fine and the movie ends. Leslie Mann looks great, but you hardly notice because her character is such a whining joy-sponge.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was imaginative, creative and completely in tune to 21st century kids it also addressed morals, values, and empathy!
B00729GQ0A|4.0|Sophia has lived with being an outcast in her town for years. She has lost all of her family and there have been some mysterious deaths around her. She has always been able to turn to her Wiccan heritage to find peace from the noises in her head. She has also been able to rely on her friends' Ivory and Lauren, but has felt distant from them as of late.<br /><br />Sophia is a likeable character and I enjoyed learning more about her throughout the book. There is a supernatural world out there that she had no clue about. With that discovery she must also learn more about herself and her ancestors so that she can deal with the new threats in her life. She was able to take things in her stride and not freak out too much and I think that's a trait that I liked about her, because I sure as hell would've freaked out!! While I was learning about Sophia, we begin to see what the Forever Girl is and that was a great twist to the story, because I really forgot about the name of the book until they used the title in the story.....<br /><br />Charles is a great guy too. He is very curious about Sophia and he is also very gentle with her. He doesn't like to push her too far and allows her to come to her own conclusions on her own. They have an early connection and soon he has the compelling need to protect Sophia although he tries not to get attached to her. They both try to deny their chemistry, but it is hard to fight their hearts and I liked to watch their relationship build.<br /><br />There was a lot to take in throughout this book, many types of supernatural creatures that you learn more about the longer you read. There were some gaps in the book as months would fly by and obviously nothing happened in that time. It was impossible to see where the plot was heading and I liked that unknown factor. Sophia's powers continued to grow throughout the book and traitors and allies were exposed along the way. There is a little bit of romance in this book, which I would've liked to see more of.  Rebecca has done an amazing job building this story and setting it up for the action that is descending on the small group. Things are going to get interesting from here on out!!<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.e more of.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved the concept! Loved the characters! Loved the dialogues! Loved this movie!<br /><br />Wreck It Ralph is a smart way to present the idea of the film. One would think that by its title, there may be a straight forward concept,  but its so much deeper than that.

B002QNTNL6|4.0|This movie is pretty good. Watched it with a guy and he said it was one of the better rom coms he has watched. All the actors were good, except a few overdone performances. Would love to see Amanda Bynes in more movies.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Ralph Fiennes plays Michael Berg, a lawyer in Germany in 1995, when this film is originally set. The rest of the film is primarily told in flashbacks, as Michael reflects on his involvement with an woman named Hannah (played by Kate Winslet), which began when he was just 15 years old. Michael had come down with a sever illness on day, while out on the street, and collapsed. Hannah, who is already an adult, happened to come across him, and helped him get home. When Michael got better, he tracked down Hannah so he could give her some flowers, as a way of thanking him, and Michael is immediately attracted to her. The 2nd time they met, Hannah takes notice of Michael's attraction, and rather suddenly seduces him. Over the next several weeks, the two lovers meet in secret, @ Hannah's apartment, after she's gotten home from work and he's got out of school, to have sex. Hannah soon makes what seems like an odd request to Michael, she want him to read to her some of the books that he's studying in school. She says she enjoys hearing his voice, and the way he reads. And so that is how their affair progresses, they'd have sex, and then lie in bed (or in the bathtub) while Michael reads aloud to Hannah.<br /><br />What I find most interesting about how this relationship is portrayed, is that there's almost an abusive element to it, on the part of Hannah. Michael (brilliantly portrayed as a teenager by David Cross), is a naïve wide-eyed innocent, who clearly develops deep feelings for Hannah. While Hannah is show @ times to be dismissive of Michael, and be demanding of him, and mocks his youth. That, missed with the tenderness of the love scenes, creates a very strange dynamic between these two.<br /><br />Then Hannah abruptly moves away, after receiving a job promotion, without even telling Michael or saying goodbye. Michael is, of course, devastated. Then the film switches to 6 years later, where Michael is in law school. His professor takes him and some of his fellow students to observe a trial where three women are charged with war crimes, for being Nazi prison guards @ a women's concentration camp, where they were responsible for allowing some of the prisons to die in a fire. Michael is shocked to discover that Hannah was one of the guards, although he attempts to hide the fact that he knows her from his professor and fellow students, and the other two women put the blame for the fire entirely on her. While studying the evidence and facts of the trial, Michael discovers Hannah's secret, which is that she is illiterate. That's why she had Michael read books to her, because she couldn't read them herself. This info could actually help her during the trial, but she refuses to admit it, because she's too embarrassed, and is therefor sentenced to life in prison.<br /><br />Over the years, Michael sends tape records that he makes of himself reading various books to Hannah in prison, but he never goes to visit her in person. Eventually, Hannah uses Michael's tapes to teach herself how to read. And then 22 years later she is due to be paroled. Michael finally goes to see her in prison, but their meeting is strained, as Michael can't quite reconcile the horrible actions she committed during the war. He does end up agreeing to help her find a job and a place to stay when she gets out of jail, but then when he goes to pick her up on the day of her released, he discovered that she committed suicide the day before. We then switch back to the modern day (1995) where Michael is telling this story to his young daughter.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film both the complexity of the relationship between Hannah and Michael, as well as for scenes between Michael and the other law students during the trial. It's made clear that these kids are the first generation in Germany to come after WWII, and have grown up in the shadow of the atrocities that were committed by the generation that preceded them, and have struggled to come to terms with that. I also mustsay that while Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes were rightly praised by the critics for their performances, I feel that David Cross has been greatly overlooked. His portrayal as young Michael, going from age 15-22 is spot-on, and I think he's the real star of the film.<br /><br />And least I forget another great feature of this movie, and the reason why I own it on DVD: Kate Winslet gets naked. Completely naked. A LOT.say that while Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes were rightly praised by the critics for their performances, I feel that David Cross has been greatly overlooked.

B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The beginning garden scenes were lovely. Did not care for the ending.  The rescue was anticlimatic.<br />Choosing an ending made no sense.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read Steven King in years, but this came up in my recommendations list because I read a lot of history and historical fiction. I loved this book. It was suspenseful and thought provoking, but also a fun and easy read.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode.  I ended up watching all seven seasons back to back over the course of a few weeks. I also went back and watched a few of my favorite episodes a few times.  I love the relationship between the brothers Dean and Sam.  The show is by far one of the best on tv right now.
0446560065|5.0|I bought this book for my mom who loves the Simon's Cat cartoons on youtube.  This is the perfect gift for a cat lover.  If you own a cat you're going to identify with a lot of what it is in this book.

B001EBWING|5.0|watch this movie because its romantic, and it has a lot of classic one-liners. The visual remaster is pretty good, though you may want to turn the sound up so you can understand what everyone is saying.
B005ZMTAXQ|4.0|Well done all around.  This movie did a great job of turning the table from the first movie.  May sequel lose quality in the story, this one did not.

B00BGIC2J2|3.0|If you're going to be a sequel to Knocked Up, you may want to have a bit of a lighter side.
B000NV55RY|5.0|This movie still has the suspense,hilarity,and endearment that it had over thirty years ago when I was in my early teens. I really enjoyed reliving the experience I had watching it with my brother and sisters back then when we were younger. This is still a great must see.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  JUST WISH I COULD FIND IT IN 3D LIKE IT WAS WHEN I SAW IT IN THEATER.  GREAT ACTORS! AND THE WAY IT ENDS MAKES YOU HOPE THERE WILL BE A PART 2!
0307346617|5.0|In coming away from this book, my first impression is just that it is written so beautifully. The way the author paints pictures with his words is truly amazing.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, this book is a series of short stories by those that lived through the Zombie War. Each viewpoint is unique and pieces together the history and how mankind prevailed. Parts are disheartening but it is overall uplifting.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to others who are interested in apocalyptic literature.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|THIS IS SUCH AN INTERESTING MOVIE, KINDA WAY OUT THERE BUT VERY GOOD, AND ALSO TEACHES THE VALUE OF LOVE FOR YOUR FAMILY AND RESPECT FOR THAT LOVE
0380807343|5.0|This has a weird and wonderful Alice in Wonderland sort of feel to it. We follow Coraline on a journey that's increasingly terrifying and rich in atmosphere. It's  both full of wonder and darkly sinister. It's an intriguing tale about family ties, parallel universes, and the price you pay to save the ones you love.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's one of the best English series i have ever watched. I can't wait for the new season. Wonderful acting

B00BF11STU|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty is a work of cinematic art unlike any other in history. It is a superb blending of style and substance, handled with deft brilliance by Katherine Bigelow.<br /><br />I have learned about the traps that a real life thriller can fall into from \\"ARGO\\" (2012), a film which lost almost everything but it's darkly comic undertones because we knew how it turned out. No doubt it was a well-made film, but it just didn't leave me speachless the way Zero Dark Thirty did.<br /><br />Now you also know how Zero Dark Thirty turns out, and that could have robbed the docu-drama of it's most precious resource, it's ability to surprise you at a moments notice. But somehow Bigelow, and screenwriter Mark Boal keep you guessing. I think it is because there is only one major character in this film. Maya (played by an electric Jessica Chastain). So you know that every other character could die at any time. As the events of the film change, you can only hope that Maya will be able to save them... And kill Bin Laden
B000FC12SM|2.0|I felt like the book was repeating that men and women are different.  We know that.  It didn't give me the understanding I was looking for.
0385349947|5.0|Sandberg, Sheryl (2013) \\"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,\\" Alfred Knopf, Random House, New York, NY.  This is an extraordinary book written by one of the most successful leaders of the 21st century - male or female.  In her recent business roles as a senior executive of Google, and most recently as a Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, Sheryl has been a role model for millions of people who aspire to become more effective global entrepreneurial leaders.<br /><br />In her new book, \\"Lean In,\\" Sheryl points out many things that stand in the way of true equality for women and men in the work force.  She addresses both environmental challenges, as well as some women's mental models about the possibilities that are open to them for their careers.  She encourages women to \\"lean in\\" and ask for the opportunities for or challenging assignments, promotions, pay raises, and anything else that they think will help them make a greater contribution to the organizations in which they work. This book is a must-read for any man or woman who wants to be a partner in a successful two career couple. It also should be required reading for senior executives of every organization in which women work, so that they can create an environment were both men and women will rise to their highest potential.<br /><br />I am recommending it enthusiastically to the students in my courses, my alumni, and the leaders of organizations with whom I work in consulting and in their leadership development programs. Two thumbs up!<br /><br />Tom Kosnik, Consulting Professor, Department. of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford Technology Ventures Program, Stanford University.
B009O2XY12|5.0|i like this game and its a very challenging game. its kind of hard because its hard to get all the balls
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a great series far beyond normal episodic television.  The Blu-ray transfer is great. Have not had a chance to look at all the extras but there are a ton included with this set.

B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and I was very pleased to see all the plot lines completed.  After reading the first book in the series, I wondered where the term &#34;The Brothers Sinister&#34; came from.
B005LAII8K|2.0|THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />So at the end he kills himself which makes the old looper disappear, if this is true why do they act like it's terribly important they can't kill the young loopers? Why do they chop that guy up at the beginning if they could just kill him and he would vanish?<br /><br />Funny, the annoying main henchmen survives Bruce Willis' shoot out only to come back at the end for exclusively no reason at all but a semi-cool death. No logic fallacy there, but kind of funny how pointless it was. More indicative of a pointless action spectacle film than anything resembling a mind-bending thought provoking sci-fi needless to say.<br /><br />If it's such a big deal to kill people why do they shoot Bruce Willis' girlfriend/wife so irrationally? And then on top of that they have a long range stun gun for Bruce which adds on to this absurdity. Which brings back attention to concept of this film, time looping, they think the best world to portray this concept is one where the mob has to send back bodies in the past to be killed? Really? And they could just kill anyone that startles them anyway?<br /><br />The biggest fallacy of all and I'm so embarrassed by movie-goers that nobody seems to see this giant hole: In the original looper's timeline, he kills his older self, there is no confrontation. The reason the Rainmaker even exists is because at the end Bruce Willis was going to shoot his mother. Bruce Willis wouldn't shoot his mother if the Rainmaker didn't exist, which he wouldn't if Bruce didn't shoot his mother, which in the timeline Bruce is coming back from he never had that confrontation and the mother was never shot, so the Rainmaker wouldn't exist in his timeline. Is that clear? It's funny in no possible reality in this film would the Rainmaker exist, not the one where his mom was about to die (because she didn't) and not the one where his mom didn't die (because Bruce Willis killed his looper). AH! How can so many people not immediately see this?<br /><br />The kid did some freaky good acting, so I'll give it 2 stars. No extra stars for the awesome special effects because it probably distracting everyone from thinking and I guess is the reason movie-goers are becoming so shallow and stupid.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|this book has become my#1 favorite book of all time, enjoyed every single part of it !!<br />Highly recommended cant wait till the movie!
1416955070|4.0|I really liked this book, it was pact full of excitement and very entertaining to read. I liked how it was full of action so it never got boring to read, the characters Jace and Clary especially were always on a new adventure to see what happened to Clary's mom. Clary is also trying to find out why she is different from the usual shadow hunter. But Clary is not the only one that is different Jace and Clary both have a past centered around the same person, Valentine. This book is a very interesting page turner that anyone who likes an action pact book should read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Heartbreaking and HeartFelt<br />this book kept me on edge on how it turned out to be enjoyed every single momemt!!!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This movie was good. Action was good and story line was good. 007 came  a long way with many that played 007. This movie was on point.
B006AN78XS|5.0|I had no idea that I would be taken for such an enjoyable and entertaining journey when my niece talked me into watching this!<br />The casting was perfect.  If you'd like to be briefly swept into the &#34;Golden Age&#34; of Dali, Picasso, and Gertrude Stein with a wry twist, watch this gem.  As for me, I'll be looking for the magical corner in Paris at midnight.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Old School martial art with a twist. Little different from the martial art I have watch. It was not bad.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|GREAT!  Please make more versions<br />unlike jiggsaw pozzles you figure it out be figuring out where different shapes fit &amp; you can't scroll through all pieces first.

B009GEAPYW|4.0|This is a character that does not stop no matter what age he is. Alot of action and not bad of a story line.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Found this book  A great combination of both real world technogoly and old technogoly (paper) and brain power..<br />There is a lot personal interaction that if you look under the first layer you will find issues of love thgat have most of us have experenced
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I give this movie three stars. It was alright but the old school Dred is top notch.<br />Like I say again it was alright
B00A80SHFM|1.0|The singing in this soundtrack is absolutely terrible.  It's a mixture of thin voices, sing-speak, horrible intonation, and gross cheating of the score to hide the shortcomings of these performers.  It's still a musical.  Just because you made a movie of it doesn't mean you can ignore the score and pitch.  The point is to convey the story and emotion with song beyond what words alone can do. I can't believe how bad this is!  Only Hollywood can put frosting on a pile of dung and and sell it as chocolate cake to the American public.
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|Even though Bruce Wayne was up in age. He still had mad skills in this movie. Alot of action and pretty good story line.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is my favorite Love story of all time.  It is a good example how people come to love each other but mask it out of fear! It also is a good example how people from the north and south very in the way things are done, and how there were not many child labor laws either.

B0091REZMW|2.0|Hidden object games generally interest me, but so far this one is underwhelming.  Requiring I find only three items per quest is silly. I've also read reviews stating the game's design all but necessitates the purchase of diamonds to continue; while I've not personally encountered this in Mystery Manor yet, I only got to this game because another by the developer abruptly halted my progress by requiring I purchase the currency of that game - seems logical that Mystery Manor would ultimately also require I purchase its curency as well.  Avoid this game and other games from this developer if you're not interested in being forced to purchase in-game items to progress.

0985081821|5.0|This book is about a young woman named Sophia.  She has lived in a small town for most of her life, and because she is a Wiccan,  most of the town blames her for everything that goes wrong in the town.  Sophia hears buzzing in her head, and believes it to be a curse.  She starts to research her family, and finds that one of her ancestors was killed during the salem witch trials. In trying to learn more about her family, she stumbles on elementals.<br /><br />I LOVED this story.  It caught me from the first page, and I read it in one sitting. Hamilton's  twist on elementals (vampires, shape-shifters etc) was something I had never seen before.  This book was very well written, with great pacing and was fascinating.  There were a few big twists I didn't see coming at all. I wasn't sure I would like this book when I first read the description, but am so glad that I did read it.  If you are on the fence about reading this book give it a try, and you will thank me!  I can't wait for the next one to come out!

B0074YVW1G|5.0|Finally a book on why the world made progress because of introverts. Cain strikes at the heart of stereotypes around extroversion worship, nurture over nature and a few other holy cows. This is a superbly well written and researched book and it deserves all the attention it is getting.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|After watching Lord of the Rings trilogy, I thought this movie would be more interesting.  It started off very, very slow.  It picked up a little towards the middle and from then on.  Don't know...I usually enjoy anything but this one was not interesting enough to hold my attention.  I tried watching it three times and each time I just could not get into it until the middle.  Oh well.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The Second Book in dystopian novels of The Hunger Games Trilogy that takes place in Panem. There are 11 Districts, each has a distinct area of expertise. District 11 mines coal. Every year two people from each of the 12 are chosen at random from a pool of children ages 12 to 18 years of age where they are forced to go to the Capitol into The Hunger Games to fight for the death. Only one person can be the Victor. This book begins after Katniss and Peeta have enraged President Snow by what he perceives to be defiance in co-winning The Hunger Games and coming out with 2 winners. He devices a really nasty and unique punishment that has far reaching consequences for not only Katniss and Peetah, but Haymitch and all the other previous Victors and the Districts. Really well written, exciting and involved book, hard to put down. You can really feel even more now for what Katniss and Peeta of District 12 were forced and are still being forced to endure. The Capitol's promise of riches and glory and that is involved with winning the Hunger Games is not what you are lead to believe. The treatment of people in the Districts as opposed to the people of the Capitol is really defined, but then you begin to notice the people in the Capitol are not so safe either...and what has happened to District 13? Be sure to read The Hunger Games first or this novel won't make sense, it really isn't a stand alone book. I read them all in one night because I found them to be so intense and I needed to keep reading! Not a good summer read as you won't put it down (that being said I dragged mine to the beach!) if interrupted. BUT a great book to read for adults as well as young adults.
080701429X|5.0|Great book
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks will love this book.  It has a little bit of  suspense, great plot, loss. love....What else do you need?
B008YI91HS|3.0|I've seen this movie years ago and enjoyed it as a boy. Was right up my alley then and have no complaints about the film. The complaints I do have, is that it is a bit expensive. Yes, I can access it here online anytime. I do not have a kindle. If I can download it on my pc, I haven't figured it out yet. However, I doubt I will ever access it again so basically just paid $10 for a rental.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend this book if you love reading love stories this is one of the best books that I have read in a long time. It makes you cry and it keeps on on your toes I couldn't put it down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thought I knew where the story was going, but there was a curve in the road and it kept me going until the end!<br />Very much enjoyed the story!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Sorry to learn that one who dedicated his life to protecting our country should die without cause as a civilian here in the country he served.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book kept me thinking about all the problems others have to deal with every day. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what Charlie would do next.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great mix of mystery, facts, culture and character.  Keeps you reading.  Chapters not to long and interplay among characters good
B00942X8PY|4.0|This game is fun because it's more then just finding the path, you have challenges and some patterns may not be as easy as you think. It does help to pay attention to the name of the puzzle.
B00493E1GI|5.0|Not sure why people give this movie a bad review I think its inspiring and can bring you closer to the idea of the big picture
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Fun to play, especially since the cube spins in all directions. This matching game is very enjoyable for anyone that likes the genera.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just as good as season one, didn't want to stop watching it!  The pace was good with a couple of surprises.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Fast paced and intelligent. Intriguing and great cinematography. Love the mysteries. Sherlock not bad to look at either.  Enjoy.  Love it
0061673730|4.0|WHAT CAN I SAY - HE ENJOYED IT. IT PROVIDES A GOOD WAY TO HANDLE STRESS AND ALL THE RELATED FRUSTRATION WITH EVERYDAY WORK LIFE.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A breath of fresh air.  So well done.  Great examples of the period.  Cinematography just amazing.  Women will enjoy the dresses and the details that go into putting a huge meal together.  Men will enjoy the war screens.

B009LHWEKW|5.0|I've been watching Supernatural for so long. And will not stop watching. Sam and Dean. That's my boys. I'm watching them right now.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|After reading this book you realize just how sad things are in the world.  Also how strong people can really be when needed.  Loved the actural facts and the way the author mixed with real characters.
B001JIDE3M|3.0|The movie was decent to watch with my 6-yr old, but the streaming reception was horrible. Maybe the next time I rent, it will be better. Hopefully.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just burne drought the series and what a smart and well written story. No big plots olds and plausible motivations for the characters good AND bad. Good stuff.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show never disappoints!  The dialog is cerebral, creative and sprinkled with commentary on current events. It offers the viewer new perspectives of religious/monster folklore. I look forward to each new episode!
0876852630|3.0|Factotum is my first encounter with Bukowski. While it lacked the social commentary I expected, I enjoyed and appreciated its understated simplicity and ability to express the inner dialogue of a man almost entirely through his actions and encounters with others. I'll admit that upon first flipping the final page I was wholly unsatisfied. While it was evident that the tone of the book was that of tacit acceptance to a life of rejection and a lack of accomplishment, I couldn't settle with the way Bukowski abandoned his own alter ego in a state of despair. In writing this review, I found peace with the story. It is my belief that Bukowski intentionally uses an unreliable narrator to undermine the idea that Chinaski is satisfied with his life as a factotum and a barfly.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I lik this little alarm clock.  I tried it yeasterday and it worked well.  When I travel with my Kindle fire, I can use this instead of bringing an additional alarm clock.  I am very happy with it.
B000000993|4.0|it was what I wanted to hear from the  group not sure if I will order more from this group
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how you can layer the sounds! It's my favorite sound machine app yet. The sounds are peaceful and not so predictably repetitive that causes your brain to start looping with it. Perfect for drowning out other noises.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Taught this in my high school reading class.  The students loved it and were motivated to delve deeper into the meaning.
B002RN5I3M|5.0|Two hundred years after the story of Follet's The Pillars of the Earth, comes World Without End. The cathedral is still there, the village has grown, the landlords and nobles are still in charge and there is still working strife between the church officials and the town. And the story is remarkably good. I'm a big Follet fan. I've liked or loved everything I've had the opportunity to read of his. He is a fine storyteller. I cared about these characters. I hated some, loved others, laughed at a few, cried over one or two, felt the injustice of the church and the state over the people, the town and the country. I'm a sucker for hard won gains and inevitable love. I simply loved this book and believe most who read it will truly enjoy it as much as did I.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I loved the books, and HBO has done an excellent job portraying the books on screen. HBO does love to throw some nudity in there, so be prepared.
0762188618|4.0|This was the second time I had read this particular Ken Follett book. The first time was many years ago. I found it just as fascinating as it had been the first time, revealing details I had forgotten and bringing back vivid memories of those I had remembered. It is an excellent book, a quick read and a highly satisfying story! It was, I think, my first book by Ken Follett and it stuck in my mind for years as a truly fine book!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Hungry Shark is probably my favorite game! It's so much fun I will sit here for hours just playing this game. You get the objective of the game right away. (Unlike some) Eat the fish to stay alive and watch out for objects. It's a fun, hilarious, and time-worthy game.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Great set. I paired this with the next generation set for a daughter that was a fan. Loved the gift and actually watches the movies. Like father, like daughter I suppose.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I'm a skeptical person for the most part, questioning everything when it comes to controversial subjects even more so.  I thought I knew where the movie was taking me in the first half but I had no idea how bad the commercial preparation of food had become.  The movie illustrates how poorly we're feeding our country - while we all assume that we have more food than other countries it's the quality not quantity that counts.  It ends on a good note about the revolution of food production that is occurring because of consumers making conscious decisions to purchase locally and/or organically and forcing food manufacturers to change their habits.  Will it be done in time?  The story is ongoing but the outlook is positive.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is just that.  The graphics are great on my Galaxy Note II, but sometimes (more often than I'd consider acceptable), when I try to turn right or left, the guy jumps instead and I become a &#34;tasty snack.&#34;  Not sure if it's a glitch in the game, a problem with my touch screen, or user error, so Temple Run 2 gets 4 stars (benefit of the doubt).
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The only thing better than this movie is finding out that it was based on a true story.  Loved this movie.  This may be the best roll I've ever seen Sandra Bullock play... plesantly surprised she could pull that off.  I had been avoiding this movie for a couple of years because I generally don't like sports movies... but it's not a sports movie.  Why didn't someone tell me that?!?!  I will watch this over and over.  This just made my top 10 favorite movies!
B0048KXRR6|4.0|After having so much fun watching Nanny McPhee with my granddaughter the other day, we couldn't help but rent this second movie right away.  Just as before, this new cast of kids are great little performers.  Emma Thompson returns as Nanny McPhee, and this time Maggie Smith plays an eccentric character.  There's lots of mischievousness on the part of the children, as well as their conniving uncle.<br /><br />Because of Nanny McPhee's scary makeup and costume and fighting among the children, I would recommend this movie for ages 6 and up.  This second movie also contains a pretty sad scene in which the mother and children gets news that the father has died in the war.  It made me shed a couple of tears, so it might be a bit much for small children.  Don't worry though...it has a happy ending.<br /><br />These movies are full of laughs, but I also like that they actually teach some good moral lessons.  I'm glad my granddaughter convinced me to watch these.  I'm sure they'll be repeats on our sleepover nights.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|The only thing I hate about this series is that it has to end.  I love you Jason Bourne... You are amazing!!!  We've watched this more times than I have toes and every time I find something else I did not see before.  Love movies like that!
B001V5CIFI|5.0|My 12-year-old granddaughter spent the night with me the other evening and asked if we could rent this movie on Amazon.  I had heard of Nanny McPhee before, but I didn't really think it would be a movie that I would be interested in watching.  Well I was wrong!  This is a great family movie...full of laughs and lessons learned.  All of the kids are good little actors, and of course Colin Firth, Angela Lansbury,  and Emma Thompson are first-rate performers.  We really loved the picturesque settings and elaborate costumes.  Since everyone has a strong British accent, we tended to miss a word here and there, which then turned into an excuse to watch it a second time.<br /><br />Because Nanny McPhee's makeup and dress are a bit scary, and a few of the scenes contain kids being pretty mischievous, I would recommend this movie for kids over age 6.<br /><br />I'm going to buy the DVD now since it's only $2 more than what I paid to rent it.  I'm sure it'll be one of our favorite sleep-over movies from now on.
0802473164|5.0|This is an excellent book for men to learn how to recognize the Love language their wife, fiancee or girl friend speaks. It has been an invaluable asset for promoting discussion after each person takes the quiz in the book or on-line. It helped reveal things we didn't recognize about ourselves.
B00BF123WG|2.0|I wasnt satisfied because the movie kept going in and out. It sometimes went out for 10 or more minutes. Other than the quality, the movie itself was good!!
B004LROMQG|5.0|Awesome. Received it quick. Love to watch Merlin. . . . . . . .  . . . . .
B003O86FMW|4.0|Fast paced, suspenseful. Definitely full of surprises. Collins has a remarkable imagination. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|This just isn't a good movie. The entire thing is shot straight on their faces. Half the characters can't sing. I can't believe anything/one from this movie won an Oscar.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating.I didn't like the auto read because it had no expression in its voice and spelled words wrong. Other wise I loved the book and think that you should read the hunger games book :-D.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|lots of fun like the flying birds<br />the scenes are fun and very colorfull also like the new birds and the extra items
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful love story despite the ugly specter of cancer and death in young adults.  Well written and poignant, but left me crying for the loss of one of the main characters.  The courage of anyone who is dealing with cancer is to be admired.  What a terrible disease.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Good movie.  The story line was true to the book.  We both enjoyed the movie, waiting for the next in the series to be released.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This was an interesting book for those who love technology as well as a good mystery.  The characters were interesting and the use of technology to try and solve the mystery was well done.  In the end, good old fashioned reasoning wins the day.  Good read.  Read this book from cover to cover in one sitting.
0307730697|5.0|I purchased the book due to a talk I heard on Focus on the Family where Kelley was being interviewed.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book because it showed how someone can lift themselves up from the depths of a bad life and turn into a great person.  I am currently struggling with self esteem while I am starting a business.  Adams's story gave me some hope to push ahead.<br /><br />The book also opened my eyes to what the military goes through in training and in combat.  We can not appreciate our military men and women enough.<br /><br />I plan to share this book with several friends.
B001QWBM62|3.0|The recording level is great when I play it back.  I then try to load it to my lap top and am not successful.  My Great Grandson (14) was visiting and successfully downloaded a recording once and set it up so that I could download the recordings.  I still can't do it.<br />It's an expensive toy tha I can't use.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I had a somewhat difficult time getting the rechargeable battery / cover onto my mouse, but I eventually got it. This works very well - exactly what we are looking for!
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I actually heard this in the DVD version about 4 years ago and haven't been able to forget it. So I went ahead and got it in the Blu-Ray version. I don't really watch it, I just like listening to it. When he's doing just the acoustics I think it sounds phenom. I really like John Mayer's style and voice it's a very chill type of sound. I really like this and I am glad I finally bought it.
B000Q31L4U|5.0|I got this movie for my three year old son, he loves trains already. This movie became one of his fav.s quick.
B008M721MS|5.0|I love this I will want ever one to have it so everyone get it now !!!!!!!! I'm telling you
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book as is so inspirational.  I hold so many of the Morrieisms close to my heart.  I will always treasure this soulful book.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A very fun read. I would have liked a portion to be more of a real time narrative vs post action debriefs. That said, still entertaining and it tackled a lot of zombie question you never see addressed in the movies.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I am loving this game so far keeps your attention for a long time hope it keeps getting better as I play it
B0044C5SCU|4.0|This is something my husband and I watch together.<br />He travels a lot so it is fun to watch something together.<br />Sometimes it is a little strange.<br />Good thing my husband is watching this with me because I sometimes get confused if the story line is taking about the future, present, past.<br />This is something we do together
0786880708|5.0|I highly reccomend this book! It's great! It really challenges the way you think about your life and everything around you.  Great read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very cute book great ending. Waking up in Vegas is the last thing anyone wants but this book makes it work.
B008PALI5S|4.0|I really wanted to give a rating of 4.75 or even 4.95 stars instead of just 4 because this thrilling performance of Mahler's 8th symphony conducted by Gustavo Dudamel Ramirez back at the beginning of 2012 was so close to being perfect! The large or even huge performing forces required by this symphony without an excellent conductor at the helm can cause it to sound muddy and chaotic. There was no muddiness or chaos here. It was well defined, crystal clear and emotionally stirring. The only thing that marred it was the native Spanish speaking choruses had very mushy German diction (trouble pronouncing/enunciating the consonants at the end of German words) during the 2nd part of the symphony. I, indeed, can empathize with this being being a native Portuguese & Spanish speaker myself. This caused many of the words of the 2nd part of the symphony to lack the punch/emphasis they needed. The HD video and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound of this Blu-ray disc recording was excellent (crystal clear and dynamic) - bravo to Deutsche Grammophon! I would highly recommend this Blu-ray disc recording of this performance of Mahler's 8th Symphony!
B00B9RIAMI|4.0|Woodkid is the stage name of video director/graphic artist/composer/singer Yoann Lemoine, whose debut album, \\"The Golden Age\\" is a stunner.  The word \\"epic\\" has been used repeatedly to describe his music, and it is apt: using an eclectic blend of real symphonic instruments, electronic synthesis, and samples, it exerts a strong pull on the emotions between the heights of exuberance and the depths of melancholy on a massive scale.<br /><br />Yet paired with this sound is Lemoine's vocals, which are almost whispered at times.  They are intimate, close, like he is singing gently to only one listener.  Or perhaps to himself, alone.  Further, the lyrics have an introspective minimalism that is less emotional than subdued, even reflective.  This contrast between the sweeping grandeur of the music and the quiet introspection of his singing voice is arresting. It's a neat trick to hit so many buttons at once, and hit them so accurately.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, Woodkid's tastes are simple.  His messages, though clothed in apparent profundity, are not especially deep.  His lyrics have nice turns of phrase (in a thick French accent!), but do not risk challenging the listener.  His musical structures also fall squarely in the realm of pop music, however grand their realization.  I suspect this is intentional - he's a young man trying to make a splash with his first album.  It is the aural equivalent of an extremely well-made popcorn film - unique enough to provide a good high-concept hook (the polished, symphonic sound),  but familiar enough to satisfy a majority of audience's tastes.<br /><br />The proof, though, is in the listening, and I have been listening to this album almost continuously since its release.  It does its job well, melting critical thoughts away like slurry as it sweeps me along with its dramatic vision.  Perfect?  No.  For all tastes?  Probably not.  But it's certainly the work of a distinctive new voice in popular music, and worth a listen.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear his next album./>I can't wait to hear his next album.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Loved the movie, particularly watching Christoph Waltz, a professional at the top of his game portraying a character whom you just cannot take your eyes off of.  As much as I liked the film, though, I kept wishing that it was more about his character and gave him more reign to demonstrate his full range of talent.<br /><br />Still worth owning, though, particularly when Tarentino is building suspense in a scene like only he can do.  It's a time bomb that you know is going to explode, but you just don't know exactly when.  DiCaprio does some of his best work here, playing a layered villain who is a villain nonetheless and one you can't wait to see meet his downfall.  Also, huge props to Samuel L. Jackson, Kerry Washington and Walton Goggins (who is always a joy to watch) for rounding out an excellent cast.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved  everything about this so far, well not everything but that has nothing to do with the classic it has to do with the story line.<br />I loved season 1,2 and
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Well acted, but horribly boring.  None of us watching enjoyed it; we watched it until the end, but it never got better.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|All I can say is I absolutely loved the series and was disappointed when season three ended. Now I have to wait for season 4
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Lots of complications.  It was a real good series to watch but there were too many complications.  Lots of death.  I guess that's the way it was it those times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is great for horse lovers all around the world you take care of it and train it and compete it's so so so so so so so so so so so so so fun!!!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really good.  I like the fact that the food never goes bad! I recommend this game for you.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great story and nice conclusion. Loved diverse characters.easy to follow plot and a lot of humor included.will recommend to friends.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|My favorite authors can do no wrong-- I was on the edge of my seat and almost in tears for Pendergast and his &#34;good&#34; son. But Constance needs to get a life :(
B001THZAAI|5.0|When we first moved to Lille, France in the region of France known as Nord-Pas-de-Calais, one thing we heard over and over again was \\"Have you seen the Ch'ti movie?  You've got to watch the Ch'ti movie!\\"  Finally, we were able to borrow a copy of it!  We watched it with the English subtitles and my husband and I agreed that even the French might have to watch it with French subtitles because of the Ch'ti dialect that is used throughout the story.<br /><br />This is a great story, very funny, but true to the prejudices that do exist regarding one region or another.  And the scene that made me laugh the hardest was when he crosses into Nord-Pas-de-Calais and it starts pouring rain!  To fully appreciate that scene, you need to understand that this is a rainy region.  You need to be prepared to deal with rain at any moment, regardless of whether it is sunny or cloudy when you go outside!<br /><br />I recommend this movie!  I recommend visiting this region of France, too!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Really great adventure game. You really have to watch this Code-reds!!!  Build your park with a combination of herbivore and meat eating dinosaurs. Feed them and change the park layout while completing various challenges.
B0000AUHPG|1.0|I was very disappointed by this Sergio Leone work. 2:46 minutes of unbelievably slow story line . To say it was tedious would be an understatement . The story was predictable and the acting especially by the female lead Claudia Cardinale was wooden .I've seen mimes with better dialog and Charles Bronson had better lines in the house of wax .  Blazing saddles had more suspense as a western than this piece of tripe . Ive watched paint dry with more enthusiasm as well as a feeling of my time being better spent . I understand the reason this movie was a bust .
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book was a good story that kept my interest. A little juvenile, but a good read nonetheless. It was. Page turner to see what would happen next.
0345472322|4.0|This book is worth reading.<br /><br />It reveals the secret of the function of our mindset.<br /><br />it will change my life dramatically.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I read this long ago, and remembered liking it, and still do. It tells an interesting story of a young girl in a poor family, and how they survive.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I'm always glad to be able to keep up with my favorite show<br />especially when they stopped broadcasting it on the SyFy channel<br />and I don't get BBC America.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Yes I could wait six months and get these episodes for free.<br /><br />Not. A. Chance.<br /><br />Damon Salvatore. That is all.
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|This movie was slow and it ended up nowhere.  didn't make any sense.  just horrible all around.  kept using the same gags from previous movies that you can see coming from miles away.  they need to kill off this franchise already.
B00321GTJU|5.0|Good lord. This isn't eye candy. This is eye heroin. And ear cocaine. And brain marijuana. I LOVE THIS PROGRAM.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|I do not have the time to review every season and I do not need to. We have wacthed seasons 1-4 (at a rapid clip) and have enjoyed all very much. We watch 2 a night most nights.  I watched these when they aired and have enjoyed them even more watching them on Amazon.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Fun but I don't know how to get to the nether also it IS pricey but to minecraft fans it is worth it  I would probably give it a 4 1/2 stars !!
B002YVAT72|5.0|This was my favorite music player as I am an avid vinyl collector but it burned down with my house on December 1st :/ I wish there was a warranty I could use to get a replacement, if so I would love help from you guys so that I could have a good record player again!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Bond is back!  Most realistic Bond movie ever. Daniel Craig owns the role.  Good transition for the character of &#34;M&#34;.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I really had a hard time putting Sachi Parker's book, &#34;Lucky Me: My Life With--and Without--My Mom, Shirley MacLaine. It was quite an astonishing read. My mother and I had always been tremendous fans of Shirley MacLaine's obvious talents and I was well aware that she spent a great bit of time traveling the world, I admired that.  I knew from reading Ms. MacLaine's first auto-biograhy that she had sent Sachi to live with her father in Japan. I found it odd than, my opinion has not changed.To find out that she and Steve Parker left Sachi much to her own devices in her early teenage years all over Europe and Hawaii was again, disturbing. It seems as if Ms. MacLaine had a child for the photo-op's and had no true intention of doing mothering of any sort. There is so much more that is disturbing, but I don't want to give it all away. I will say that Sachi experienced a pretty dicey youth. I will also say that I believe her, you just can't make up this stuff. I gave it five stars because it was a compelling read, not because I love it. How could one love reading what boils down to a book about psychological child abuse? I applaud Ms. Parker for having the courage to write about her experiences.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|This is a delightfully different film. You will be asked to you your brain and examine the questions we all ask eventually.
B00338QENI|5.0|A compelling true story with ethical implications still relevant today.<br />5 stars for holding my interest and teaching me much about scientific research.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|The app works well, when it works. If for whatever reason a stream crashes (your end, or streamer's end), the app will also crash, which then defaults the quality to 226p on all streams. After this, I'm unable to load any streams until completing removing the app from my account and reinstalling (which bumps the quality up to 240p, the default with no saved settings), and then some streams can load and you can increase it to something more average for twitch streams to have available (360, 480, or 720).<br /><br />Originally 2 stars, Upped to 4 after recent update to the app, which eliminates the problem I (and apparently a lot of other people) were having.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is fun.  so many levels, it keeps on going.  I laugh each time I play it<br />It was recommended to me....and I would also recommend it.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I liked the concept of and action in the movie. I liked that &#34;a romance&#34; was not quite the crux or fulcrum. I also liked the compare and contrast between two people, both fighting for what they think is good and right. Contrasting is how time can change the same person's views and values. ALSO, we come to expect a story where the main characters are the main object, and that the story ends with their ending-happily after or not. I've been exposed to many stories lately where the &#34;main&#34; characters are only the catalyst for the continuation of someone else's story. This movie is a prime example of that.
1407136542|4.0|The first book was an interesting exploration of an unusual premise.  The last two books seemed to get bogged down in an overdone premise.  I enjoyed the series on the whole, but it probably didn't need to go much farther than the first book.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Picture is detailed and colorful.  Even more challenging and exciting then Temple Run! I play it often and so does my 6 year old!
B002KT3XH6|3.0|The writings had way too many people to follow,especially when their names changed to their titles.  I did spend a lot of time referring to a dictionary,but the story or history kept me going,finishing it.  Being a amateur genealogist, the history fascinated me the most .
B00BYOEZTI|4.0|Great CGI and lots of action.  Great cast.  So far just as good, if not better than the Lord of the Rings series.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|I read this article in Maxim years ago about the bad cops in the LAPD, specifically an African American man with a Spanish name, who may or may not have been linked to the Biggie Smalls (Christopher Wallis) murder.  this article went on to explain that the guy was basically a gangster with a badge.<br />After his arrest and incarceration, gang violence went up significantly in the LA area.<br />Shortly after reading the article, this movie came out... I immediately saw the link between the movie and actual story of this LAPD officer's true story... Very good film (although very Hollywood of course) and the acting is superb.  Loved it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. Every one should try this game. G5 did it again with an awesome game.<br />Please please please play this game.
B003KVKQB4|4.0|Fascinating but way to long. The point was made many times in different contexts and I found it depressing at times.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Want the real inside information on the muslim world and how it operates, this is a real eye opener. Ayaan is not bashful or afraid to tell it like it is, childhood to accomplished adult, the book follows her life and how the muslim world affected it. Very hard to put down.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This was a great movie.  The description sounds like a downer but it's delightful.  I'm recommending to all my friends.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like the old accu weather that had all of the health features especially the breathing cardio arthritis and the sports and all of the tips and different articles about them.  I LOVE  this
0553386697|5.0|This book is incredible. It is a must have guide for all parents even if your children are teenagers! It has opened our eyes to things we have not realized we have been doing wrong. It provides explanations and methods to talk about hard topics. Do not have to read \\"What to expect...\\", instead read this!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally liked this version a lot better than the original Temple Run. It has better graphics and the scenery is very beautiful.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|An emotional rollercoaster and I thought my heart was gonna stop at the end --- I actually went back and re-read the book a day later with the knowledge of what the ending was....WOW.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I didn't have any idea that people drop Out of families and careers to hike these trails.  The story of courage amazed me.  It made me envious of her courage and the story fascinating.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Love this movie. Bought it for a friend for Christmas because it's what she wanted, and she was also very pleased.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was beautifully written. Bravo Eric Blehm. Extraordinary story about an extraordinary individual who overcame extraordinary adversity. Adam Brown inspires all men to be better men, sons, brothers, fathers, husbands, and friends. Great book!!
B000JML7EC|5.0|Loved it as a teen, enjoyed it even more as an adult! Wonderful character development. You can almost hear the pirates singing...
B001BKV9TE|5.0|This will be a farovite for a long time. A simple but effective story for the ages. A Must see!!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Abysmal. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I read the 5 star reviews; the praise is uninspired, cliched, and insincere-- just like the book itself! This is nothing short of a scam, and it shakes me to the core that somebody is making money off of this abortion of literature.<br /><br />As has been said before, the characters are woulden (sic) and one dimensional, the pacing is rushed, the writing is stilted, descriptions are unbelievable, internal cohesion or logic is non-existent, conflict resolution is a boring foregone conclusion, vocabulary is 5th grade level, clumsy, half-baked exposition, so badly edited that it seems the author wrote it her sleep and then published it in her sleep.<br /><br />I would bet my house that Rice made this story up as she went along, without any idea of where it would go. If she's still writing installments for this garbage, you can probably be sure she still hasn't figured out how it all ends. The deductive writing style is painful to follow and allows for absolutely no narrative depth.<br /><br />Moreover, it seems as though the author considered herself above the level of intimate knowledge and dedication required to bring a realistic fantasy setting to life. The story has nothing whatsoever to offer the reader from an educational standpoint and is, in fact, counterproductive to that end. There is no indication that the author has even the vaguest understanding of the concepts she attempts to employ, be they of a moral/emotional nature or simply a matter of medieval culture, politics, warfare, etc. Only the laziest possible framework is established for the setting and even that seems written off as secondary to the rapid yet predictable progression of the protagonist.<br /><br />The protagonist is essentially your average Mary Sue who accomplishes every goal set before him by effortless force of will and \\"destiny\\"! Development seems to be too much of a hassle for Rice, so every supporting character merely has one polarizedextreme reaction or the other. Overall, it gives the sense of a poorly written stick figure cartoon fantasy epic intended to parody the genre.<br /><br />I might have just snapped my fingers and kissed my 3 dollars goodbye (actually, I'll probably get a refund) but the 100s of fake reviews she must be getting to spur her talentless career are a trap for unsuspecting buyers everywhere.<br /><br />The only way this quality of writing could be justified is if the author is no older than 14 years old herself. Either way, it doesn't make for even a tolerable read, and certainly not one that deserves a monetary compensation. This makes the worst fan fiction seem like Frank Herbert or Tolkien. Comparing this to to those writers is nothing short of insulting to EVERYONE involved.<br /><br />Do not buy.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Fast quad core that's not too expensive. Stock heat-sink is plenty for modern processors, idles about 30 degrees Celsius for me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game. Good fun. Kids love it. Make it a family event and challenge your family members. We love this game.
B003JXUXPW|5.0|GP's voice and meter complement the lyrics perfectly.  I had wanted some good jazzy blue songs to listen to and heard  Mr. Porter on a podcast.  I am so glad I purchased!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Was FAOTD. Good graphics, simple match 3 game play with challenging obstacles. Will play through the game. Story line can be skipped.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|GP's voice and meter complement the lyrics perfectly.  I had wanted some good jazzy blue songs to listen to and heard  Mr. Porter on a podcast.  I am so glad I purchased!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Good read, a little slow through the first half, but the second half couldn't be much more fun to read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I just love this program, and my wife has been enjoying it, too. Simpler times, but complex characters, some who are either religious bigots or drunken stifles may surprise from Time to time., but the main characters never disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game for kids who want to learn how to take care of horses. This game will teach you how important it is to take care of the horses.
0785126708|4.0|While unable to maintain the all around brilliance found in 'Planet Hulk' Pak still manages to convey the Hulk's rage better than anyone in recent years. This story is the payoff for 'Planet Hulk' and tells the tale of the Hulk's return to earth to take revenge on the men who conspired to remove him from their planet and destroy his new home.<br /><br />As expected the often patient and cunning Hulk from 'Planet Hulk' is nowhere to be found here. Instead, consumed with a rage never before seen, he's intent on letting the world know the truth of what was done to him, his world and the people of that world by the 'Illuminati' (Stark, Richards, Strange and Black Bolt)<br /><br />Needless to say, if you come into the book knowing the back-story or a just interested in a Hulk tale full of anger, destruction and violence: do read. This volume is filled to the brim and even though 'Planet Hulk' is required reading to fully appreciated the Hulk's stance, you can get by without it if need be.<br /><br />Cameo's by a number of the Marvel Universe's biggest names are notable, as is Romita Jr's art. No, it can't hold a candle to the work in 'Planet Hulk', but Jr is often reviled amongst fans and I'm not entirely sure why. He does a more than adequate jobb here, IMO.<br /><br />Ultimately, while somewhat simple and featuring a few too many cliches (please, enough of the \\"God help us all\\" moments) this is probably the way it had to go, after the ending of 'Planet Hulk'.<br /><br />No it's not as brilliant as what preceded, but World War Hulk is a fitting enough ending to one of the greatest Hulk tales in his long history.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It irritates me when I cannot figure out which way to go, but then I pay coins to figure it out; and then I'm like - DUH!  I love puzzles and this one is really fun.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Very entertaining, it kept my interest going each week. This is my first year that I had used Amazone. Enjoy
0739302752|5.0|This was a gift to a executive with a large company, the book( CD'S) was so well excepted that it was recommended to the company president and the executive suite staff,
0817439390|5.0|This was a great buy, great price, new book, but I did receive it damaged. Beautiful pictures and great explanations.

B000VOC90Y|3.0|My previous Wenger was a very similar design held up for approximately 6 years of daily use, traveling overseas, between office and home, and even on numerous vacations.  The stitching started to fail uniformly on the shock-absorbing shoulder straps and the material was finally showing some signs of wear after many years of use.  I was willing to pay more money to get another backpack of equivalent quality.  The new Wenger Ibex 17 inch Notebook Backpack arrived from Amazon and I was pleased with the pockets and various arrangements of items.  However, the backpack felt lighter (not necessarily a bad thing if the quality and durability are the same), and the zippers did not seem nearly as robust as my original Wenger backpack.  After several months of the same type of use, I have concluded the material used on the new backpack is of inferior quality, as are the zippers as well.  I have not had any catastrophic failures, other than a few jammed and skipped zippers, but it is annoying and disappointing to see Wenger's quality deteriorate.  The material is also showing signs of wear.  The low price does not make up for what was once a trusted name in knives and backpacks.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought the book made a compelling argument for keeping people alive when they're in a coma.  His writing is very natural, and I followed the story very well!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I caught a show of the current season on tv recently and like it so much that I went to Amazon and ordered EVERYTHING!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Kept hearing about how good this series is.  Had a full day off, chores all done, rainy and gross outside, so I figured I would watch an episode....watched the entire first season in one sitting!!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|From the first show I saw, Serenity, I was captured and became a &#34;brown shirt&#34; too.  Then I convinced my friend to try it and now she's becoming addicted too.
B009NX409M|5.0|How could one go wrong w/ De Niro and Streep together in the same movie?  Just watching these two actors in the same movie is worth your time!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This is where it all started for me.  I enjoyed it so much that I've ordered the entire series and 6 tee shirts!  I'm a &#34;brown shirt&#34; now.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie is interesting, informative and provides a look at the intelligence used to find bin Laden.  Persistence and bravery dominate this story!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Maybe these background stories might have been science fiction 15 or so years ago, but now????  I didn't catch this series when it first aired but am really enjoying it now.  I love &#34;Walter.&#34;
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Pleased to have another Rebus novel.  Up to standard. I hope John Rankin keeps writing about him.  Good John Rankiin reading  again
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I've enjoyed this and the first series so much that I ordered all the seasons and three books.  I also got my friend hooked on it!
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I started out reading the books, so I had pictures of the characters in my mind that didn't match. The dwarf was prettier on HBO than in my mind, for example, but overall it is well done. Better getting it this way than paying for HBO!
B003L77FYS|5.0|The relationship between Castle and Det. Beckett is so  adorable.  This show is addictive.  I told my friend and her husband to watch it and now they're hooked too!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Zero Dark Thirty is a more detailed and polished version of Seal Team Six.  No matter how it's told, it's a great story (to say the least).  I don't get why Jessica Chastain lands all the plum roles.  Many other actresses could have done a better job.  However, it's a good film and the content is intense.  I muted the torture screaming.  There was too much emphasis on the efficacy of torture.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|so far it is a good book leaves off from the end of the 4th book hopefully it will continue that way
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good picture, slow in places, don't believe they developed characters to the actual folks they were portraying. Also too long.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Have loved this movie ever since the first time I ever saw it. The up-date to Blu-Ray and 3-D was amazing bringing you that much more into the movie.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|im very happy with my purchase. i have no complaints, came on time no damage movie was great quality just as i expected.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I've resisted reading all this time because of the hype. I was wrong, it's worth the hype. Everyone should read this book. Give it to your kids.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It was a great movie- the story line and the interesting idea of gaming, how characters have feelings and opinions about themselves and the way they have fun interacting.<br /><br />I would recommend it for childrena nd adults.
B005HSL626|3.0|fun game but ad pop ups between each screen are a pain<br />easy to play works well on kindle fire
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great story, not having the commercials is wonderful. Can't get enough!  I can't wait for Season 4.to come out.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Great book. Hard to get into at does, but once started reading couldn't put it down. Love it very much
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have enjoyed every Ken Follett Novel I have rad so far.  This one kind of put a reminder on how horrible Hitler truly was.  Ken Follett is an amazing story teller
B008NMT684|4.0|My 3 year old has a blast putting these puzzles together I didn't mind paying the extra to unlock them all.
B009UZBLSG|2.0|I gave this product a two star because it lacks the basic requirements to function the way it was intended to.<br />The item description in terms of what devices it works with and what special software or TV it works with.<br />Those information are essential to the consumer when buying something.<br />I would recommend anyone trying to buy this item, to contact the seller first and have answered any questions you may have before buying instead of going tru the hassle of having to return item.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Can't wait for season six. I love grandma's line men need to be loved and women need to be wanted
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is such a cute program.  The more you play with it the easier it is to use.  I would recomment to anyone.
1616550414|5.0|Despite of the long section dedicated excluvely to Skyward Sword, this book is amazing. It has a very amount of information about each game's plot, artwork, curiosities, developer's sketchers, etc. The chronology section is great. It is a heaven's gift, a long awaited item for every Zelda fan.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|love dearly for a million reasons ... I keep categories for ministry...cars I like...appointments ...dreams I have... etc. Couldn't live without it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this book, but I hate how psychotic and grim the book ended.  This really isn't my type of read (with all the mental games involved).  I'm more of a light-happy read kind of book-reader.
B004XZR63M|5.0|There is so much information in this book I need to read it again to make sure I remember it all.
B004INHTK4|5.0|I think the problem with most people's perceptions of this book is firstly that they don't understand the dark humour it is functioning within and secondly that they form their options on excerpts rather than the piece as a whole. This book is not a &#34;how to&#34; guide - it's a &#34;think outside your culture&#34; to see the benefits and pitfall of another. This book is a memoir not a biography - a memoir entails memory which is constructed by the writer and from their perspective... It's supposed to be biased. Read this book and expect to laugh - I did - at the crazy antics of this woman, be shocked and appalled, but then consider... Her daughters love and respect her... Not many &#34;westerners&#34; can say the same thing despite all the esteem they lavished on their children. I highly recommend this book
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love this game. My daughter loves this and I downloaded it for her and discovered I liked it myself f.a lot like farmville and minipets
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love this game. One issue is that it won't let me buy necroa. But that's no biggie. Definitely download if you haven't yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best on the market. With all the new updates, there are endless possibilities. New missions around every corner for you to complete and level up.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|This is a great record.  It cannot be more plainly stated.  I realize that there are some disappointed long time fans who do not feel that this record is as good Soundgarden may have seemed in the 1990s.  However, nostalgia can cloud our vision.  I went through a similar ambivalence when Jane's Addiction released \\"Strays\\" in '04.  It seemed something was lost.  And it may very well have been.  However, compared to the mass majority of crap produced by our illustrious corporate overlords this record is amazing.  In many ways I like this record better than Soundgarden in their heyday for the simple reason that it sounds more mature.  Chris Cornell's voice is incredible.  The songs are still thick walls of sound that wash over the ears.  \\"Been Away Too Long\\" opens the record.  Initially it seems a simple and straight forward song atypical to Soundgarden but the layering is solid, the arrangement is surprising, the song picks up incredible momentum, and \\"King Animal\\" never looks backs.  \\"By Crooked Steps\\" starts out with a, choppy groove but the effects on Cornell's voice are incredible and pulls what could easily be a chaotic song into something sublime.  The out of place \\"Halfway There\\" is another one of the highlights and sounds more like solo Cornell tune than a Soundgarden song.  The demo version is even more intriguing.  In all this is a great return from Soundgarden and is undeserving of some of the vicious criticisms it faces from supposed diehard fans.  I recommend the deluxe versions of this album as the demos are excellent takes and feel in no way repetitive.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is very interesting and I loved it! It's very like wanting to know more after you finish each chapter. The first three chapters are a little confusing but once u get pas  them your going to want to read the next book!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed it. It was a fun, easy read but as a number of others have said the ending was weak, but the rest of it made for a good &#34;beach&#34; read.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I THOUGHT THE GRAPHICS WERE COOL! I LIKED RIDING IN THE HOT AIR BALLOON. I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|As a new Kindle Fire user I was looking for an alarm clock to add to the functions it performed.  This one works very well with the Fire.  The Fire can go to sleep while the alarm is set (good when not plugged in to charger), and it still works, although the dimmed display is not available.  You want a night light and illuminated clock, it will do that too, but suggest keeping the Kindle on the charger when doing this so it is fully charged in the morning.  The display brightness is selectable, and if you want more features like multiple alarms to set, or don't like the advertising displayed you can upgrade by buying the full feature version.
B00BHMF578|5.0|There wasn't anything about this movie that I did not like. It had great suspense and was intense throughout the movie. Ben Affleck was definitely at the top of his game when he directed this.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Love the movie, plan to buy it on the day of its release (can't write a more positive review than that, can I?) .... locally to get a better price than Amazon is offering. I came here looking for info on special features to decide which version to focus on ... and found none! Here, from the \\"Lincoln: Official Blu-Ray Website\\" ([...]):  ____________________________________    Disc 1- Blu-ray Feature Film + Bonus  -The Journey to Lincoln  Steven Spielberg and his collaborators discuss the challenges and excitement of bringing this story of a complex and very human president to the screen.    -A Historic Tapestry: Richmond, Virginia  Steven Spielberg and team discuss the historical significance of Richmond, Virginia, and why they chose to shoot the film there.

B001HC8516|5.0|great read and great info! i loved it and it mad me laugh even at myself, def worth the money
B000001EMW|5.0|This is really intense, heart bleeding, cello awesomeness!!!!  Perfect for people like me who are fans of Epica's classical/opera/metal genre.<br /><br />If you're on the fence.......<br />Just buy it.<br />Seriously.
B00362WGW4|5.0|Muy buen packaging, un set para atesorar, todo es una maravilla, realmente quede impresionado, espero poder que otros puedan tenerlo.
B005CAATXG|5.0|I got their single &#34;Make a Move&#34; track first and after several months I caved and bought this whole album.  LOVE it!<br />Although I'm not entirely sure about the content of the lyrics, it seems very clean and hardcore at the same time.  I hope they stick with this genre and lack of vulgar content!<br /><br />(PS- I got the Amazon Auto-Rip version and haven't even needed to use the CD, great convenience and great value!!)
B009FZFONO|5.0|It is my favorite tv show out there. I have never seen anything like it before its awesome.Cant wait for season finale
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I saw the movie first but enjoyed the book even more! I would read other books by Nicholas Sparks without hesitation!!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Non-stop read from beginning to end.  Believable characters in a colorful West Virginia setting.  A plot with many twists and turns.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|It's a brand new way to watch an old favorite. Paramount has converted the 1980s crowd pleaser 'Top Gun' to a viable 3D release. This is not a gimmick or '3D in name only' but a surprisingly solid 3D presentation that suits the movie quite well and looks great, particularly in the film's many aerial training and combat scenes. It's not quite the mesmerizing conversion that is 'Titanic,' but fans nonetheless should be excited to see the film in an always dependable and sometimes breathtaking new 3D format. Paramount's two-disc Blu-ray also offers the film on a traditional 2D-only disc. The package carries over the same soundtrack options and supplements as found on the film's previous Top Gun 2D Blu-ray release. For thoughts on the film, audio, and supplements, click through to that review; this page will focus on the 3D transfer only. New screenshots have also been sourced from the included 2D presentation (NOTE: screenshots are representative of the 2D version of the film, which appears to be the same as the previous 2D-only release and do not reflect the quality of the 3D transfer).
B000002KFJ|5.0|In my opinion this album is the quintessential Black Sabbath with Ozzy Osbourne CD. The music is still very fresh and my 14 year old is going bananas over it too - so something has to be right about it hey.
B002ZG981E|5.0|There is a small, militant camp of malcontents who despise everything Christopher Nolan has ever committed to film, and their numbers only seem to grow as countless critics and the movie-going masses at large declare him to be one of modern cinema's greatest visionaries. They see Memento as pretentious, arthouse drivel; Batman Begins as a serviceable but unspectacular foray into comicbook adaptations; Insomnia as bland and uneventful; The Prestige as an over-scripted mess with three twists too many; and The Dark Knight as an overblown, over-hyped cash-in that doesn't deserve the accolades it's received. To them, Nolan's latest buzz-earner, Inception, is either a dull, confounding, over-plotted misfire or a convoluted, self-important, superficial brain-bender. My apologies if you're one of these disgruntled few... I can't come out and play today. I've long been one of the masses, willingly drinking more and more of Nolan's Kool Aid with each passing film. As far as I'm concerned, Inception not only stands as the pinnacle of a master filmmaker's canon, but as a cerebral masterpiece in its own right; one that's far and away my favorite film of 2010, and a strong contender for my favorite film of all time. And believe me, that isn't the sort of statement I ever make lightly.
B000002KE2|5.0|Their early sound was so fresh and so very different back then. I only discovered Sabbath in 1985, and while I never owned this on vinyl, I thought it was about time it appeared in my CD collection. Money very well spent, any fan of Hard Rock or Heavy Metal must include this album.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It was bound to disappoint. With expectations at an enormous high, a 48fps experiment in tow, and fandom, both literary and cinematic, frothing at the mouth, poised to strike the moment the first film in The Hobbit trilogy showed the slightest sign of weakness, it was bound to disappoint. And yet it shouldn't have. Criticism continues to run the gamut. Too long! Too slow! Too expansive! Like butter scraped over too much bread! Was anyone really that surprised to see Jackson and company indulge a little? Did the decision to stretch two films into three fail to clue anyone into the fact that An Unexpected Journey would be more akin to a Lord of the Rings extended version than a lean, mean theatrical cut? For that matter, are the same people who swear by The Lord of the Rings Extended Editions actually upset with the end result? By some strange, blinding magic: yes, yes and yes.<br /><br />Fortunately, it was only bound to disappoint some fans. There are those among us who chose a different path. Those who were familiar with the quaint, charming tale of &#34;The Hobbit,&#34; enough so to avoid setting Rings-slaying expectations. Who didn't squander our first viewing of An Unexpected Journey by leaping headlong into an entirely new (and arguably distracting) way of watching a film. Who were overjoyed to immerse ourselves in Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth once again, for whatever length of time he saw fit. No, The Hobbit isn't perfect. It isn't a sacred adaptation of Tolkien's text, or even one that rivals any of The Lord of the Rings films. It's a gorgeous, gripping, at-times enthralling return to Middle-Earth, though, with far more to offer the Peter Jackson and J.R.R. Tolkien folds than many are willing or perhaps able to admit.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|This was the first Black Sabbath LP I bought way back in 1985 and I loved it ever since. The sound is just so extreme in comparison to what was &#34;popular&#34; back then, and today it still sounds every bit as extreme as it did back then. A timeless classic.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Peter Pan: a long-awaited addition to Disney's Blu-ray canon that somehow makes my collection feel more whole, more complete. It isn't just a personal favorite either. It's one of Walt Disney's most beloved animated classics, one of the studio's greatest treasures and arguably the best Disney animated feature released in the 1950s. It has survived controversy -- Tiger Lily and the Indians are still considered racially offensive in various circles -- and weathered criticism about the liberties Uncle Walt and his screenwriters took with J.M. Barrie's 1904 play and 1911 children's novel. And yet no censorship has been perpetrated and very little criticism has prevailed. It's a high-flying, swashbuckling adventure in the true spirit of the original and, in many ways, was the first production, on stage or off, to lend a thrillingly palpable sense of magic, grandeur and storybook fantasy to Barrie's text. Even today, some sixty years after its theatrical release, Peter Pan remains a magnificent animated film, as truly timeless as any Disney classic that came before it or come since.
B0076794IO|4.0|It is light reading, not too complicated to follow the plot. Exactly what I was looking for in a vacation read. If you're from Luxembourg, or you've lived in Luxembourg for a while, it's funny to have these flashes down memory lane.
B009L32R5I|4.0|A better singer would make this album 5 stars. I recommend this product to any genesis fan from the Peter Gabriel era.<br /><br />Musicians from other old bands should do projects like this one.
0783231202|5.0|United States historical event everyone should know. Ridding our country of slavery was a complex process and this movie documents one step in the process.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read many of Grisham's novels while this one is not one of my favorites it was a great read. He has a flow to his writing that makes for a quick read and captures your attention.
B00177YA1K|2.0|Great technology, poor relation of script to technology, poor acting (maybe because of poor script). Silly plot. Skip this movie or rent it. I gave my copy away.
B008M87GJK|4.0|The BBC site is attractive and I appreciate that I can customize it.  However, it requires a lot of scrolling to see which stories are available.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a story many of us can relate too. A young love that is torn apart for some reason. The couple who gets a chance to reunite and raise a family. An older couple who has to deal with Alzheimer's but stays true to each other through loss of recognition (by the wife) of a spouse, children, grandchildren and ultimately reality. This movie is a true slice of life story and anyone who got lost in some of the trivia of the plot has totally missed the point of the movie. The Notebook goes down as James Garner's finest movie. Plus, Gena Rowlands did a superb job with a very difficult part.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy playing so much that all my other games are sitting on the sidelines. My family and friends are just as hooked on Mystery Manor. Too bad the Coins and Diamonds cost a pretty penny.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the start of a story that could be the future for our grandchildren, if we let dictators consolidate power. I eagerly await parts two and three which I understand are in the can but not yet released.
B00AGKH6D8|4.0|It was a great recording but it would be nice to hear more solos instead ofjust cool rhythms.  Couple of songs were kind of slow for funk music.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|Great setting, script, actors, editing. Just good fun wrapped around a reasonable set of love stories with good music and parties. Fun to watch over and over.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fairly easy game to play when you have nothing else to do. I play it on my flights to California and Florida
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Great story, music, settings and editing. Also tells of the pressures on major stars and how some of them survive.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|i liked it alot, long movie but kept my interest for sure,,great cinematography, good story,,had me wondering at the end, which story was correct....
B004N6369Y|4.0|Very interesting story about growing up in a hotel.  At times the story was predictable but at the same time it was still enjoyable
B001NZH9GY|5.0|Beautiful feel good movie that is both comical and dramatic. Great to see Lionel Barymore and John Barymore in a movie together. If you like Joan Crawford this is a must see movie as she is very young in this.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good story line. At times there was alittle confusion where he was related to location.  All in all a good book and worth your time
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was awesome.  Not the kind of story I would normally read, but I loved it and it kept me very interested.  The writing and details are really great.  For some that think they would not like a &#34;violent&#34; read- yes there is some violence, but it is very well written and it is not gory in my opinion.  I had to read all three books after reading this one, great story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A wonderful story.  I also saw the movie which was very close to the story.  I think this is one of his best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book and felt so invested in the characters that I had to read the second book.  This is written so well, but be warned it is a cliffhanger---just go ahead and buy book three Mockingjay too.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|After movie was a hit, one feels like going to the origin. Author strts very well but then there is endless tale of what one can eat and how cruel one can be to survive. Doesn't look true that you don't feel ill even for a day with so desparate a diet. Diappointing compared to the movie
B005HSL626|5.0|I first discovered this game on a big screen at a Chuck E. Cheese, of all places.  Simple as it is (all you do is &#34;cut&#34; the fruit with the swipe of your finger while avoiding the fruit bombs) it's a lot of fun and addictive too.  A great game to play when you just want some simple fun and relaxation.
B0092EE5HY|4.0|This was a good book. Loved the way it winds around and surprises you. Wish there were more books written about this character.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Needed this for a trip. My phone battery runs down fast.  Charged this up and it charged my phone twice and partially charged my iPad as a test. It is small about size of my phone and has several adapter<br />Cords but not for new iPad so use the one that came with the iPad. It works and should be a good backup for airports and when out far from nearby plugs.
1401235166|5.0|A nice addition to the Fables story. Wraps up the Northwind story nicely. Story and artwork up the the best of the previous collections.
B00BI5IXL4|3.0|The film NEEDS closed captioning to make the songs understandable.  Much of the singing is completely unintelligible. This takes away from the performance and leaves the viewer wondering what was said.  It also lessens the impact of the story line.  Must be an issue of using actors instead of vocal artists for the movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Slow at the start, but in the end I could not put it down. can not wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|It work's fine my needs in church and I don't get headache from the loud music at church thank you
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's pretty fun, but the social media thing is pretty annoying and kind of limits your progress sometimes. Overall it's a really well done game.
B00A8V3VVG|1.0|Very disappointed!  More movie dialog than music.  We've bought soundtracks before but should have just downloaded individual songs with this one.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Enjoy watching this movie. I don't care how old I get I will always love Disney Movies!! BUY IT!! NOW
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It's amazing and pretty challenge to playing this game. I like this because it gave me  few choices to use control the kart thing. I really like it a lot!!!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Exceeded expectations!  It's subtitled - but don't let that stop you.  You won't find a better story this this year!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie successfully crossed over fantasy with the old Western influence. I'm not talking about Sergio Leone spaghetti wetsern's either - this is the Bloody Nine as William Muney in the Unforgiven. I think Abercrombie is a master, and I think this might be the best book out of all 5 - even The Heroes.  I've owned this for a few months and have read it three times already.  The dialogue is razor sharp, the characters are incredibly well formed - even if you don't like them, you're fascinated as to what happens to them. This book brings in several new, great characters, while some of the best from the past re-emerge as well.<br /><br />You read it - and it leaves you wanting even more from this world. If for nothing else, any fan of this series MUST read this book just to get reacquainted with our old friend Logen Ninefingers.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Many just want to see his face , his expressions acted out on film. If you expected to see his face, you wont.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|And read this series.  Wool is one of the most original and fascinating stories I've ever read.  I've read a lot of dystopia and apocalyptic books, but Hugh Howley was able to do something completely unique and bring a fresh look to the genre.  His writing captures the bleakness and devastation of the future, tempering with the undying hope inherent in mankind.  I never once thought I was reading SciFi/Fantasy.  I was reading a story about people, and everything Howley wrote just seemed natural and fit.  His ability to capture the essence of humanity was what drew me in and squeezed the breath out of me.<br /><br />If you haven't checked out Wool yet, you're lucky, because you have all the books to read one after the other in this Omnibus.  I had to wait for each one to come out. Just get the Omnibus, do yourself a favor, because when you finish one, you won't want to wait to start the next.<br /><br />My first ever 5 star review - very well deserved.  The Wool series is one of the best and most original books I've read.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|i loved it im like wow the best musical in years cant get better than this i plan to buy the sound track
B00785P2QC|5.0|super game it is so addicting I can't stop playing it. I have one problem its the energy thing. change this and I would be so happy
B007EDYN36|4.0|I enjoy reading a biography, especially the rock n roll scene....I am not nor was not ever a Kiss fan, but this was a good read...interesting perspective from the drummer, who is usally the one that is heard from the least, anyways...no matter how good they are!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has followed Kiss or not. Just seeing things through different eyes and souls is always interesting. Its never what you think it is, and for a fan of any band to see how it really is once the encore is over is always an eye opener!!<br /><br />I am happy I read this!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I do like it. plays great on my kindle. Would like some info on how to get frozen blocks that are not connected.<br />All in all fun game to play.
0547848412|5.0|Great book.  Wish I had read it before I saw the movie.  Don't know why I received two books so I gave one to a friend
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever.my dad's high score is 111894!!!alsome ha he is the champ at this game.it is like he own's it!my dad is preety cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!please read this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />love Adi
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its cool awsome. its amazing I wish I was cool gghhjkkjggndgfufngfuffifu fgfhh h b h u bb h h h h
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Just a little too far fetched for my liking. It is as if Grisham ran out of ideas for a story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i did not expect the monkeys to be bigger and it is more difficult but it is touch sensitive other than that it is adicting and awesome
B00B2V66VS|3.0|my kids play this more then me but i like the fact of the different things to challenge you on the game
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Osmos is a great game that is challenging in the later levels and simple to start.  The graphics and music make the game a pleasure to play.  I would recommend it to friends.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was a perfect way to close out the series!  Bane was the perfect villain for Batman,  He was able to get Batman to challenge Batman enough to make him see there wasn't any longevity in continuing to wear the mask.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|A little bit more than just a &#34;scare&#34; movie.  The plot is mostly predictable, but there is enough clever acting and well shot moments to make it worth the price of entry.  Overall an enjoyable film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun app! I am addicted to it and it is so life like I really enjoy it! so awesome! cant stop playing.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book! You won't want to put it down once you start! More love than actual SBDM in this series! I liked it better than 50 Shades of Grey!!
B00BF11STU|4.0|A dozen years since the worst attack on American soil, a back story of what may have lead to the killing of Osama Bin Laden and a meaningful strike against Al Qaeda is presented in &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34;.  The storyline is meticulously woven with broadly reported events and high production values and wrapped in Director Kathryn Bigelow's reportage style of cinematography.  We are present during supposed meetings, black ops and interrogations that will never be de-classifed, to understand what our government has been doing to recover some sense of control over our homeland security, providing us a sense of the anguish and sacrifice made in the struggle.  We get news coverage and clippings from available sources, but this movie gives us a chance to feel like we're peeking behind the curtain.  Even without the focus on the feminine contributions to what's been achieved, this is a gripping and believable film effort.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This one is better than the first in the series! So intense, but actual love. Another great book that you won't want to put down! I cant wait for the third one now!!
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I pre-ordered this as soon as I saw it.  Longtime ABB fan, it was a must for my collection.  I have really been enjoying the music.  Duane had his way of accenting any song he was playing on.  The classic jams are really good, love the old bands with the horns, it just flows.  Such a tragic thing for the music world to lose Duane.  This is a must for any longtime fan, or the new one exploring the music.  The ABB is still making music today, no doubt that Duane would be loving the shows at the Beacon if he were still with us.  Get this box and play it loud.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun game, and as challenging as you want to make it.  Can waste lots of time playing this for sure.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|A must have.  Shop amazon and save money.  I hope they can exspand this app to sreach google if they Amazon does not carry a scanned item.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|A lot of the songs have a style reminiscent of big band music. The songs are all pretty long and I think that's a bonus. Definitely worth checking out. Favorite songs so far are Tunnel Vision and Mirrors.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great show. Full of suspense, even though we knew the ending.  Interesting to see he behind the scene work by the CIA.  Very interesting
B003UESJH4|4.0|Acting is fantastic and the story is great for all ages.  Inspiring to see Mr. Rush and Mr. Firth play roles together.
B002EDH0FE|3.0|Didn't quite live up to the hype...  Glad I didn't waste the time and money to go see it at the theater.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Movie starts off pretty slow and makes you wonder if you made the right choice.  Soon it picks up and gets better and better as it goes along until you are indeed on the edge of your seat!
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|This is simply Suede's best and most consistent work since \\"Coming Up\\", they sound fresh and inspired, both musically and lyrically-- a very moving album that reminds you why you fell in love with this band back in the day in the first place. Perhaps it's true that some of the production/mastering could have been tweaked a bit more carefully, but the quality of the songs here cuts through any of those minor imperfections... If you gave up on the band after \\"Head Music\\" and \\"New Morning\\", you would be making a huge mistake not to give this one a chance... a hidden gem.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|If I would have read the book first I probably wouldn't have looked forward to the movie. What's her name couldn't have won the Academy Award if it were based on her charscter in the book.  And the father...a huge disappointment!  Letters and more letters...The Asian Invasion...It makes me even more aware of the screen writer and what must be done with a concept to turn it into something the public can enjoy.
B0090SI460|5.0|Nice movie, i like ir very much! Specialy in 3d, this movie has a nice adn vibrant colors, when you see in LED and 3d tv's
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I enjoy playing all the Angry Bird games but this one has a lot of different challenges and also a lot of &#34;helps&#34; to get you a higher score. It's fun for all ages!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am never disappointed in an episode of the Walking Dead, it is Just the best series ever, I highly recommend!
B00AAQ7JNA|5.0|Rhianna is a very talented and gifted singer with a natural sense of performing that captivates her audience. She will go far in her career.
B001F3DY9A|3.0|She has hit that point that it seems all she sings about is how bad guys are and how they hurt her. When you look like her and have her talent and money, she will need to learn she needs thicker skin before she will find a quality guy.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|With practice the advice in this book really helps. Some of the things mentioned I never even thought about for casual conversation.
B002WOZKY8|1.0|Justin Bieber is not quality entertainment. If you want real music, you would be better off with Justin Timberlake and most other artists. I would even choose Lady Gaggme over the Bieber.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Good product. works great and is exactly what I wanted. I would suggest that every one buys this product right away.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game.  I even have my younger grandchildren playing it constantly if I let them.  This a fun and challenging.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|and that would be about it!  I'm not quite sure n why this director made this movie.  Yes, it's quite different but if you have ever seen another version of AK this does not even come close.  I love Keira Knightly and Jude law but even with their acting they could not save this movie.  Sure glad I rented instead of purchasing.
B003U53GK8|5.0|I am re-watching the whole series and season 6 and it is much better and more coherent than I remember.
B00138J4QO|5.0|for anyone who is a andy williams fan as i am should pick this cd up as i have & include this in their collection.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|An addictive game, but all I know is that within hours of downloading this app, my fairly new (and therefore not widely used) debit card was shut off for suspicious purchases. When I called to check what happened I learned fraudulent charges had been made using the account connected to this app. Perhaps it's a coincidence, but it seemed fishy to me.
B001NU4CDM|5.0|great album that anybody who is a styx fan shouldnt be without if they like this group they should pick this one up.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Addicting.  I need season 3 now and might have to buy.  Amazon needs to list as free instant video now ;)
1451695195|1.0|This book arrived well packed but it has pen marks in the inside pages. It was sold as &#34;new.&#34; Take your chances.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I've been looking for this movie in DVD and now I found it and, case is in very good condition, plays very good and very good pirce ...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved every page. I can't believe how sad I am, knowing that there is no more to read. The story was great, the characters were real, the pacing was perfect. It is one of the most well written books I've ever read. I can't wait to get into the next Hugh Howey story. Thank you Mr. Howey for a story that all other stories will be compared to for a long time. You have set the bar high.
6304806434|5.0|I've never watched this movie before and it is very good, Plays very good, case very good condition, and very good price...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My favorite game (; loolll nice bunny outfit for the police XD love the characters ! and thanks for letting the app be free (;
B005S39YGU|5.0|Love the characters, dialogue, and story lines of this show.  Going to purchase the next season.  Season 2.  Check it out.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I've used Last Pass software for a long time on my laptop and I recently downloaded it for Kindle. Totally happy with the performance. This little program generates secure passwords for any website and then stores them in encrypted files. when you log back into a site, the program gives you your assigned log in and password. Having been hacked at Facebook and Twitter more than once when I created my own password, I feel much better with this method. the only password you have to store or remember is the master for LastPass.<br /><br />You can make that one as long and varied as you like, put it in a safe place, and feel secure. LastPass also offers a way to create a two-step authorization for the program, and that is about as safe as you can get. Nothing is foolproof, but read the documentation on LastPass website, and you'll see what I'm talking about. You can install free or purchase a subscription for like $12 a year to get additional options, like mobile sync.<br /><br />this program is on my list of essentials for every day computing.
1616614609|5.0|Just wanted to state that I purchased this game while attending PAX East in Boston. I spent $40 on the game and considering it is on sale here I highly recommend purchasing the game.<br /><br />The game is rather complicated considering each player has basicly different rules they have to follow. Corporations tend to play very defensive overall and Runners are very offensive. 3 out of the 4 games I played this weekend I was the Runner, and I enjoyed ever minute of it. My shortest game was 10 minutes long (I lost, my buddy played a rather ingenius trap on me),  and my longest game was almost 2 hours long (first time playing, first 30 minutes was learning the game, I won at the end of the 2 hours.).<br /><br />If you don't mind the game being complicated, it can be really fun. Once you get the hang of things it becomes a very interesting and fun game. The rules aren't hard to learn it just takes a little while to get the hang of them all in how they corrispond to game play.<br /><br />The game is ment to be 2 player but my friend and I are seeing if we can adapt the rules for more then 2 since we would like to try a larger scale game.<br /><br />Again highly recommended.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I usually don't take Angelina Jolie seriously. Most of the movies with her is just a high speed action that runs over good acting - which, I recognize, is not Angelina's forte anyway - and this one was not that different. Just the storyline was a lot more interesting and intriguing than other installments from Angelina. And was not disappointed (much :) )
0547564651|3.0|A good subject but way too tedious for my needs. Paul's ideas make sense but he needs to clean up his presentation for the everyday needs I have.
B00AH69AX0|4.0|Big, big fan of Metallica in their early days.  Loved the first 3 albums.  After Cliff died ddin't know what to expect.  ....And Justice is a very solid album, not up to the standards (in my opinion) of their first 3 albums but very solid.  Last album before they were ruined by Bob Rock.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Didn't see the movie and wanted to read the book first.  Will probably view the movie at some point.  REALLY enjoyed the fast read and story.  Really had no idea of the plot when I bought this - so was very enjoyable.  Definitely recommend it.
B0011Z5IUK|5.0|Remember getting this on cassette back in early 80's and proceeded to wear the tape out.  Rock's greatest band's arguably greatest album.  What else is there to say?  Pick it up, you not regret it.
B0060CV31C|5.0|Disney has another classic in The Emperor's New Groove.  The not so subtle message in this movie is to think about others feelings before you act.  Always a good message for kids to learn.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a movie that deserves to be watched a couple of times. I found myself thinking about this movie days after having watched it.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|This app is very difficult to set up. Nearly impossible to add a printer to your device. This problem exists on Android devices as well.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I do not have this problem with ANY other game on my device (Transformer TF300).  This lack of response to touch makes collecting coins a hassle, and at times &#34;Code Red&#34; mode is nearly impossible.  I do like the game and it can be fun, but the touch responsiveness really takes away from the game.
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|My love of this album doubled when I listened to the surround sound and watched the animation playing out the story.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Clutch goes back to their straight-ahead, rock and roll roots on this one and the results are amazing. Don't think about it: just get it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watching this show is like going to a movie that is so wonderful, I'm sad when it's over. . . accept this ones just keeps going on and on!
B0026ICMLY|1.0|I am extremely disappointed with the product and the description. The product was not new , inside the box was torn and the box has some outside shock
B004PR71JC|5.0|My boys (6 & 4) LOVE this soundtrack (I think they like the music better than the movie) and I love how there are no inapproriate lyrics.  There is a very nice blend of upbeat and mellow songs.  There really is nothing bad I can say about this CD!
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|Not much one can say except listen to it. And then listen to it again. There are some incredible moments here and it's an intensely personal album full of anguish and anger and ultimately hope. It's a fantastic end to the trilogy begun with the incredible &#34;Ever Changing Times&#34; and then &#34;All's Well That End's Well&#34;. If you're a fan of excellent musical compositions and jaw-dropping, beautiful playing, then this is a must have.<br /><br />Steve Lukather is simply one the best there is and &#34;Transitions&#34; is worthy of your time-- time and time again! Make no doubt about that!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|GREAT ARTIST, KEEP UP THE  EXCELLENT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SUPERB ARTIST, ANTICIPATING NEW ALBUM.  GLAD SHE COMPETED ON AMERICAN IDOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!I I  FOLLOW HER MUSIC
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I can't put it down. I Love it. If you like bejeweled you'll like it. I keep going back trying to get 3 stars on each level
B0014DQSG2|5.0|Such a sweet lovely story.. No matter what family always comes first.. LOVE IT<br />Always like watching free spirited Americans in a uptight English class.. enjoyed it a lot..
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I gave Season 3 a five because it continues to tell captivating stories that really develop its characters in unexpected ways.  The first 3 or 4 episodes were very slow, which was frustrating considering how long we'd waited for season 3 to come out, but it picks up further on in the season.
B005K17RU0|5.0|One of the best weather reporting sites I have ever signed on to. I can view the weather in New York and with a click be viewing accurate weather reports back home in Seattle. You have the cabability of pulling up detailed reports or viewing simple temperature and percipitation information. You can also go to live video reports on this same site. If you work outside, like to travel or just interested in the weather you will not find a better weather reporting program.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game. And I have to first mention, that it is not just for kids...lol. I am 40(something) and this is my new fav. game!! I was even surprised to make it to the dark forest!  Actually travelling there the very first time really freaked me out with the amazing graphics, I didn`t know what was gonna happen!  The balloon ride is way cool as well.  Disney has done an excellent job with this game the picture/graphics is just gorgeous! Can`t wait for more places to travel to in the game.  If you like ANY of the Temple Run games~~you will LOVE this one!
B00241YHMU|4.0|I like this movie because one gets to see the wisdom of one who ages backwards. Still the same in some ways as one who ages from birth, yet a whole different wisdom. Benjamin seems to appreciate his middle years and youth more. This movie has a lot of memorable quotes, especially the letter to his daughter.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. It plays perfect and scores pop up after every game giving stats that make the play time more enjoyable. The slight annoyance come from the ad at the beginning of each game. Yet, the game is so good it is worth the 2 clicks to get away from the ad. I highly recommend this game.

As an example, using the framework of experiential realms can be very helpful when designing environments for customer interaction (chapter 2). Understanding the mechanics of theming helps to make otherwise boring products more interesting (chapter 3).  Additionally, understanding how to eliminate sacrifice from customer interactions can be beneficial in creating mutually fulfilling relationships with customers (chapter 5).
B0094K1MH2|3.0|When I watch a movie to the end it has to be ok, otherwise I turn it off. Animation was very good.
1595825045|5.0|I would recommend this book to any die-hard avatar fan who wants to know more about the series and its art, or for anyone who just wants to add to their collection of avatar merchandise. This book was huge, which I wasn't expecting, and it is very in-depth with the information. I haven't yet finished the book, but so far it is phenomenal! I would also recommend buying any avatar books and comics from Amazon because they are fairly overpriced in bookstores, and what's not to love about free super saver shipping? (just be sure to add more avatar merchandise to your cart :P)

0670020745|5.0|I first began reading this when I borrowed it from a friend, but realized I wanted my own copy for future reference. It contains some important explanations of what's going on in our brains, and I love how she extrapolates from the personal to the universal -- plus it's good for any of us in education who can help teens and others understand how their brains work (and how to make them work better).
B00992CF6W|5.0|Were is the clay on survival mode?I love this game the only thing I have to say about it is can there be minecarts and tracks?this game and the game on the Xbox are the only two minecraft games I've played.

B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I fell so in love with the Bondaurant brothers. It was perfect for me and my husband to watch together. It had lots of action and an amazing story line, but had an underlying love story that played out with some of the characters that I could root for. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!!!
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I have really enjoyed the entire series and I am a huge movie fan, i have unfortunately  not had a chance to watch the entire movie yet
B0018OFN4U|5.0|This movie is hilarious. My teenage boys love it. It is not so stupid you can't bear to watch, but it's lame enough that my younger daughter is not scared of the zombies in it.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|One of the best movies ever made in my opion.  Worth buying and so glad it FINALLY came to Blu Ray
B002JIEYL2|5.0|Classic album, Sabbath bloody sabbath(classic riff), A national acrobat and sabbra cadara( check Metallica version on the Garage Inc.)spiral Archittect and Fluff (great Acoustic)
B0044DEAUA|4.0|This item was very easy to pair with my phone.  Have only had the device for three days, so have not had much chance to use it.  It works exactly as described, has simple to understand controls, nice features, all of which seem to work as they should.  Sound quality and loudness will work well in my motor home, which is the reason I purchased it.
B002JIEYLC|5.0|Sounds great just as the original recording. Awsome sound!!. Just as it was recorded and and meant to be enjoyed. Loved the booklet with a histroy backgroung of the album and the band during that period

B002JIEYLM|5.0|Sounds great just as the original recording. Awsome sound!!. Just as it was recorded and and meant to be enjoyed
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I love Scott's writing style as he tells about his rise to ultra-running fame.  As an aspiring vegan myself, his account takes on a very personal tone for me.  I highly recommend this book to any ultrarunner, or someone concerned about athletic or ethical nutrition.

B00A8ECU24|2.0|Game is great and 6 year old loves it. However the cost is ridiculous and linking the account to facebook doesn't work. I had to troubleshoot why the game wouldn't link up to facebook all of a sudden and now I am unable to reinstall it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This show is now my favorite show and everyone go has ever watched it with me has gotten hooked! Great entertainment and I would recommend this show to anyone.
B000VRNCGQ|5.0|Gues I am kind of an Eric Clapton junkie.  This is some classic early Clapton.  This is a some great stuff.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This was a really great book. I could just imagine an old man going on a walk like this. The story doesn't end how you would imagine that it would and has some little surprises. It was a voyage of discovery - of himself and his life. It makes one examine oneself as well. Very enjoyable and highly recommended
0670026603|5.0|I normally do not take the time to write reviews of books. With that said; however, I felt the need to comment on this story.<br /><br />First,I didn't want to read this story. I have friends living happily with SCI's at this level and higher and my boyfriend is not AB. So, I went into the read with some preconceived notions on my part. I expected it to be a sappy love story with inaccuracies regarding the characters and a skewed dynamic. What I read however made me ponder who the author knows.. it felt like she was writing from a personal level, not as an author but rather, a friend or someone close to SCI and addressing some very delicate subjects.. and addressing them with grace, humor and tact.<br /><br />At the beginning, I wanted to rush through the novel.. then suddenly I was invested in it. As the relationships developed and days of the story flew, I wanted to slow it down, scream no, make it stop.. but wasn't that the point? Will's life had slipped out of control and the only thing he had control over was his life, or rather; how to end it and why that decision was made.<br /><br />I am not advocating this ending. I am only asking that as you read, do not judge. It is not possible, unless you are living that situation, but try to put yourself in Will's chair. I know many who are living happy, full lives with SCI but each person is different- as is each SCI. So take the time to invest in the characters. Think before you react.. and keep thinking as this book is currently haunting my mind. I don't like the ending, I wanted to scream, yet... understand that Will needed to control his destiny in the only way he knew how. And he was blessed to have the characters by his side who brought sunshine, humor, laughter, love, and acted as they did.<br /><br />I wish I had the back story to this novel and I also would have liked to have seen the author flesh out some of the characters we met in the SCI chat rooms. These people can be angels in very trying times but timewas of the essence and the book is short :)<br /><br />Tea, kleenex, and no knee jerk reactions, please. Think and invest- then think some more. My mind keeps coming back to two thoughts. Peace (both physical and emotional) and the ability to have control over one thing- when you have no control over many many others.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The beginning of a Sword & Sorcery series of unspecified length. I would class it as a juvenile novel. Eighth grade. The price was tempting, and the basic plot was well handled. I was offended by the entire novel being double spaced. (Make it seem longer?) It greatly impedes reading. The characters spend a large amount of text dithering about what is happening to them.<br /><br />I tended to skip read the book, as reading every word was getting laborious.<br /><br />As I said, it was habit forming, enough that I ordered the next novel. At $2.99, why not?
B007BVOEPI|3.0|Listened to the book on Audible (Amazon's sibling) and found it entertaining but not compelling. Felt the same way about the TV show. Other than the naughty bits (of which there are many) it was a little snore worthy.
B00BNYCFNM|5.0|Big Big Train is a great band that combines some of the best musicianship with engaging and progressive songwriting.  They have always been a great band but with English Electric Part 1 and Part 2 they are taking it to an amazing level.<br /><br />I have been listening to Part 1 for 6 months and have given part 2 many more than the needed 3 spins.  I absolutely love both parts and consider them some of the best of symphonic progressive rock.<br /><br />Many of the songs have threads that weave together and compliment each other and The Permanent Way is currently my favorite song and is the magnum opus that ties all of English Electric together.
0670026638|5.0|Reading this book was a terrific visceral experience. The first part lulled me into several nostalgic trances; the book's second half does not pull any punches in depicting various sorts of violence. I see/feel the book playing with and evoking Japanese popular culture, especially anime, even as it stabs the sexist romance of that genre. WaPo, NYT, and other reviewers did not mention this at all, though. I would really like to see a feminist anime connoisseur write a review of this book too!
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|Some great songs by Neal Morse and the rest of the band.  The best songs are Infinite Fire, The Storm and the Blue Ocean.  All are definited 5 star songs
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best show on television.  I didn't think you could keep such a show suspenseful and exciting for this long based on slow zombies but this show exceeds every expectation.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|A really good movie. Now I see why it recieved so many awards. Liked the special features too. Made me so tense near the end even though we all know how it turs out.
B00005BCK6|5.0|I have always been a fan of Star Trek since I was a kid.  William Shatner  is such a cowboy.  Always doing things his way and explaining to his superiors later.  I often wondered what the big bosses thought of his reports.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|so this film was right up my alley.  Anthony Hopkins lost his &#34;self&#34; in Hitchcock.  Helen Mirren was also very good as his wife.  I enjoyed seeing &#34;Janet Leigh&#34; and &#34;Vera Miles&#34; again and the old Hollywood trappings.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I find this pen too short and skinny as I have arthritis in my hand and this device is sore to use.  Although the features as advertised are the reason I purchased this, it would have been beneficial to know the dimensions when I made the decision to purchase because I wouldn't have shelled out $15+.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|After we watched the home version we went to the theater for the 3D experience. An absolutely amazing story which took us by surprise.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Such an excellent show! Recommend to ALL! Can't wait for the new season to begin! I'll be the first to watch!!!
B00BF11STU|3.0|This got off to a slow start but picked up speed after a specific person was identified.  Our military was amazing.
B001KOFH2G|3.0|I like the series, but the movie did not really do it for me.  Not the greatest movie, but it was entertaining
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss' books are amazing! This is a must read among all of his other books! Such good tips, tricks, and recipes!
1451627297|4.0|If you're a Stephen King fan you'll love this book.  If you've mostly avoided King's works because you don't lean towards horror / fantasy then this could be the one book of his that you might want to try.  It's not horror, and even though it involves time travel it's only a tiny bit science fiction.  Mostly, it's historical fiction.  And having been born in 1952 I remember that world and it's astonishing how perfectly King captures it.<br /><br />The protagonist Jake Epping travels back to before the Kennedy assassination in order to prevent it.  But his portal doesn't take him to 1963, it takes him to 1958, so he has to live a few years in the past. For a man born in 1976 the 1950's are more than just another time; Jake feels like he's living in another universe.  Everything is different, from the food (which wasn't nearly as \\"processed\\" so it tasted much better) to the music to the ethos of small town American life.  Jake doesn't approve of everything he finds, of course, including race relations or the sometimes hypocritical \\"community leaders\\" he encounters.<br /><br />He has to create a new life for himself as George Amberson, get a job, and survive in that distant time until the moment finally arrives for him to complete his \\"mission.\\"  He had no idea what he'd endure when he took the job, but one thing he never imagined would be falling in love.<br /><br />It's a long book and I'll spare you a long review.  Suffice it to say that there's a lot of action.  It has thrills and it has spills and especially as the years go by the feeling of urgency keeps getting stronger.  There are moments of hilarity.  There are moments so poignent that you'll cry.  (Well, I did anyway.)  Then there are the ponderables: of course if Jake succeeds in saving Kennedy from Oswald it'll change the course of history.  But what other changes will take place if, for example, he places a bet on a sports event or affects the career decision of a teenager or simply has a conversation withsomeone that wouldn't have happened if he hadn't gone back in time?  What will the world be like when he returns to the present after mucking around in the past for five whole years?<br /><br />While I haven't read all of King's books I've read a few.  I liked some better than others.  This book I recommend highly.  Stephen King has matured, his writing is approaching what may be his personal zenith, and ultimately I believe this will be regarded as one of his finest works.  If you're not already a fan this might make you into one.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of all time despite the historical inaccuracies. The story, themes, soundtrack and setting are all fantastic. It's purpose is not to be a perfectly historical representation.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|this movie is so funny Pi was good and him and the tiger got to be friends the tiger help him
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is okay. The levels are really easy. I'm  almost at level 30 and it is still easy! Where's the challenge???
0345803485|2.0|Never been a fan of trendy stuff, hence why i just read this. Where do I even begin? Oh yeah, her inner goddess...WHAT IS AN INNER GODDESS?!  I quote &#34;my inner goddess is doing backflips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast&#34; -_- really? Secondly, Anastasia's character is so blank and under developed it amazes me. Based on what I got, she might as well have been a ghost wearing a white cloth with 2 holes for eyes. Don't get e wrong the sex bits weren't so bad at first, but at some point I was like no more sex please!. And yeah, her conscience wasn't wrong for calling her a &#34;ho&#34;. At some point I got so tired of her complaining and whining, after which she would still get into bed with him.  Also I wonder how come she still had a lower lip with all the biting going on. And the sex! It's ok to describe everything but not say the body parts? &#34;And I felt it down there&#34;...where? Your ankle??? &#34;And he touched my 'sex'&#34; -__- And on to Christian, we get it, he was gorgeous with grey eyes and copper hair and grey eyes and oh did I mention grey eyes? And billionaire??? O_o come on. And what was with the &#34; 50 shades of...&#34; And &#34;7 Shades of...&#34; We get it.<br />And finally, I couldn't get the picture of Bella and Edward out of my head! The similarities...unbelievable.<br />I would love for everyone to read this book, IT IS A &#34;MUST&#34; READ.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it because it is very adventurous and very awesome and I specifically love adventure apps and this one is skillful with adventure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to read this series after having watched the film, as I suspected that there was much about the characters that the film could not portray. I was pleased to find this to be correct, that the characters were much more nuanced and complex, and their motivations, in particularly Katniss and Peeta, became more clear. This book was an easy read and kept me engaged from start to finish. I enjoy the social questions that this book poses and it makes you think. Great book and I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Bought this book off of the title and blurb alone. It was a great read. If like Malcolm Gladwell toe books, you'll love this one.
B004089HZ2|3.0|This book was a light hearted look at the tobacco industry, and the great lengths the industry will go to put a positive spin on their products. The ending was a bit anti climactic, but overall I enjoyed the book. Some sexual content, some language.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Great look at a young Rick Moranis and Steve Martin. When Ellen Greene belts out &#34;Suddenly Seymore&#34;, you can't help but get a chill. What a huge voice from out of nowhere!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We absolutely love this DVD collection and can't wait for the next ones to be available. Arrived in great shape and very timely.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I found the book very difficult to get into.  Also the book seem like the author read a whole bunch of books and made up her own by copying other authors.  The book did not make any sense or held my interest at all.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|What can I say? It is a wonderful series and a delight to watch. So glad that we own the series so that we can watch it over and over again. There is so much to see, beautiful costumes, decor and great characters in the series.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The series continues on strong just as expected. Looking forward to season three. I paid the gold price of course.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My kids love this game and they dont get bored with it at all. It keeps them entertained so I can get a little time to myself lol !!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|At first, I didn't like it very much. However, as I read on, I found out that the book is deeper than it seems, so please take your time to dig deep into Chbosky's words. Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: I must add that there is some strong sexual content and other content that might be considered inappropriate (mostly in Part 1). Other than that, I think it is worth it, especially if you are a teenager (you'll feel even more identified). If not, you will for sure remember what being a teenager was like.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is the best horse game that I have ever played.  beauty is so easy to take care of. I love it!!!!!
B00B99KJR0|2.0|This game has a story and detailed graphics wrapped around yet another match 3 game.  I would rather play one with no story and no graphics.  This just wastes a little time between each game.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|What a wonderful bond these two formed!  I like movies based on true stories.  These two men did an excellent job of portraying their characters.<br /><br />NOTE:  The language spoken in this movie is French.  If you don't like subtitles, skip this one.  I didn't mind them because I do speak some French, so I didn't have to READ every word of the subtitles.
B006C1DH92|4.0|I got this for free when Amazon was having a promotion.  I would have chosen the plain fruit ninja if I had the choice.  I didn't so now I have Puss in Boots talking to me.  Still a great game though!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I've seen this movie only once before, when I was quite young.  I'm so glad I purchased the DVD....a testament that you can do anything you put your mind to!
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|I love the art style on this game.  I find myself playing it just to see what other characters will pop up.  As for being a game, it's okay.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Heard nothing but great things about this flick and I absolutely loved it personally.  Only bummer is hot off the heels of what could possibly be the best Bond film ever...they are switching Bonds.  And...Sam Mendes will not do another one he says.  Well, my personal opinion is this is certainly worth a recommendation to essentially anyone.  Has everything you could ask for.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|I really enjoyed looking at this game for the first 10 minutes or so, but after that time I got pretty bored with it.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|Very fun and entertaining sci fi comedy.  I recommend this to anyone, the aliens are bad ass and the kids are hilarious.  This is a great sci fi/horror/comedy flick about a particular block in London where the kids who are usually out causing trouble happen upon some aliens and hilarity and action ensue.  You won't regret checking this one out.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|What else can I say about a white noise app? It's a white noise app that makes white noise. I'm adding in this last part because Amazon requires x number of words.  That's weird...
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I went into this with relatively low expectations considering the metascore of 58 and the fact that they inexplicably have made a relatively short book into a trilogy.  Ultimately after sifting through the critical reviews I found that most of the gripes were with the way Peter Jackson shot the film in 48p as opposed to the standard 24p.  The effect that creates is very soap opera looking, for those who leave motionflow on with their televisions they will not notice a thing.  Personally I hate motionflow and have it disabled on my set, thus resulting in a much more natural and filmlike effect when compared to on which I feel makes it look like video.  Personally do not understand how that changes the film as a whole or why some reviewers felt compelled to bash it for that.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, it is not perfect by any means...but I feel that I can safely say to any LOTR fans that they should enjoy this flick.  I have already watched it twice and expect to watch it a few more times.  Picture quality is outstanding and the surround is equally impressive.  I don't want to give anything away about the movie itself but I feel the action is spread out nicely.  Highly recommended by this LOTR fan!
0345528581|5.0|I have only started using this book for exercise ideas.  I prefer the Big Book of Exercises but I will really check this book out to see if it will help when I travel and do not want to take any equipment.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Hard to find games I alow the kids to play and they loved Temple Run.  Exciting version they enjoy and I do as well.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|not movie material, dispite award winning director and music, artists suffer visual gratitude. best seen live. like watching<br />a concert on film
B00594XOZU|5.0|im 14 female umm single kik me it is  angelforever so im look for nice guys gud looken not over 17 thx u: )
B007L6VR12|5.0|The<br />Best<br />Movie<br />Ever.<br />Have you ever been to church on Sunday when the Boy Scout troop shows up, and the &#34;Scoutmaster,&#34; a grown man, is wearing a uniform, and you're wondering, &#34;Does he sit with friends and have cocktails dressed like that?&#34;<br />If you've ever pondered this notion, Moonrise Kingdom is the movie for you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun to play and a good way to kill time. For those with no life this will fill the bill for now.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I am not sure if I would recommend this book.  She was looking for a way out and used everyone as an excuse for a decision she had already made.  It was just ok.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|This is a disappointment.  The film is so dark for the first 30 minutes it is hard to see what is going on.  The sound is muddled/muffled throughout he film and the music overpowers the dialogue.  If you haven't read The Hobbit, good luck trying to figure out what is going on.  A real waste of time and money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this game is so cool because if you lose than it doesn't remove points or make you restart.
B00008EY7H|5.0|Enjoyed this production very much.  Very much in the spirit of Cirque du Soleil and entertaining from beginning to end..
B009KEN87O|5.0|this is a Fun game that is also challenging for all ages,  all ppl should try this so so so so so so bad
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I bought the book because of the academy awards but was very disappointed. The book could have been written in half the pages.. it was very repetitive and so full of football nonsense that I was getting annoyed every time they did the eagles chant. Maybe it made a better movie but as a book I was glad when it was over.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|A really good review of alternative medicine! Written in a funny way, but always thorough and never patronizing. Recommended for everyone, a skeptic will get a good laugh and users of alternative medicine will learn something useful.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|These books were awesome to read. Real page turners that made you want to just keep reading and root for this poor misunderstood young lady.  Just to find out she wasn't misunderstood it was just that no one took time to know her. A must read for mystery readers.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Delicate emotions/acting and beautiful scenery quietly draws audience deep into the story.<br /><br />After watching this movie very pleasantly, I watched 'Sense and Sensibility' directed by Ang Lee as well, storylines that share something, and another beautiful directing by the director, and it is another movie worth watching, if you liked this one.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|Black Christmas is one of my top five Horror movies of all time. I am a big slasher movie fan. Black Christmas predates Halloween four years. It doesn't really get enough credit for inspiring other horror films. I saw for the first time late at night during a snow storm and I was wowed. I never got bored watching this movie. It had great suspense and great acting. Olivia Hussey stood out to be me as the lead female going opposite the killer. Hussey is not your typical horror movie scream queen. She is different from the iconic Laurie Strode played by Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween. She is different from Amy Steel in Friday the 13th Part Two.  I thought she did a great job.<br />  Margot Kidder is great comic relief and a character you care about. John Saxon who also appeared in A Nightmare on Elm Street appears and does a great job. His character her is likable unlike A Nightmare on Elm Street. Keir Dullea did a great job. He looked really creepy and certainly played it well. All of the actors did a good job. I enjoy this movie especially during the Winter. This is must for any true die hard horror movie fan. I have a lot of horror movie fan friends who haven't seen this one. This is very overlooked classic. Cheers! Have a great day!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I have followed his career through the years in film but never bought any of his music until now.  This is a wonderful edgy rough sound that is very inviting.  My favorite song is Valentine's Day and The Stars are out Tonight.  Some of the musis sounded rough around the edges which I loved.<br /><br />These artists with overblown polished music that you know if they performed live would not sound anything like what the song sounds like. These songs I could picture him singing live with little polish.<br /><br />Glad I gave this a try. Now I will start buying some of his older stuff.<br /><br />Great cd!
B00005NTJM|4.0|What a nice debut - mostly great songs, great arrangements, cool flute with some jazz thrown in for fun.  One of the best they ever did although Aqualung, Thick As A Brick and Stand Up are classics.  Would be a 5-star album without the very tedious \\"Dharama for One\\".  Highly recommended!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is just what you would expect and so much more.It was every detail you would want in a real world account of what it takes to get by on a modern bat field.The story is given to you in short precise doses keeping you wanting more.This book let's you inside the mind of a regular man,no matter branch,and let's you realize that it isn't magic or superhuman powers that make a Seal or a Ranger but the will power we all have as Americans to do what we know and do it the best we can.Bless the families of Mr.Kyle and Littlefield and may their memories live forever in all our hearts as 2 men who put everything they had on the line to try to protect the rest of us from the evils of this world  one round at a time
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|i like this because it is fast and easy to install. this is my frist build and im overall happy.
0071390111|5.0|Great book! Essencial to everyone involved in neurosciences - simple language, great illustrations. It was worth waiting for this new edition!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I blew through this book in 3 days. This was a great follow up to the first book. It brings you further down into the world of casters, which is awesome. The way it is written just kept me reading. Definately suggest this book if you liked Beautiful Creatures.
1451695195|5.0|Gobbled this book right down because the author's near-death experience isn't the most amazing part---it was his perfect credentials for influencing everyone's opinion about that experience!<br /><br />I've visited places such as this neurosurgeon visited during his 7-day coma, and my nearly forty years of studying the *interdimensional* science of Consciousness made it all seem normal and to be expected of someone in his dying situation. What impressed and astonished and delighted me was how PERFECTLY his situation was designed to gain the attention of everyone who has NOT yet come to the awareness that consciousness does not begin or end with the physical brain!<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book. It's quick to read, because the story is so compelling, and the doctor/author has gone to great lengths to explain why this was NOT hallucination (that part of his brain was classified as completely nonfunctional at the time), or any other among a long list of conventional science's debunking explanations for NDEs. His unique experience refutes all of these arguments.<br /><br />The only flaw in the book isn't really a flaw: he can't yet explain how or why these things happened to him. Not to worry, Dr. Alexander! Others have and will. For instance, \\"The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation\\" by Ernest L. Norman offers complete, diagrammed, scientific explanations for the aspects of consciousness that bridge dimensions. This science fully explains how and why he experienced the visions and connections of his NDE, where he went, and perhaps even why he did so.<br /><br />As for why his deceased father didn't come to greet him during his other-side visit--that, too, can be explained. It's in my books, it's in E.L. Norman's books, and one day I'm sure the author will understand, as well.<br /><br />Because of my already-established beliefs, I'd stopped reading about near-death experiences, but I will be recommending this book to everyone who'll listen!
B00942X8PY|4.0|This is an interesting game and for free so why not. Keeps you interested and engaged to play more. Addictive.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Amazingly Hollywood portrayal of a Broadway production.  Rossem and Butler have great voices and do the characters justice.  The Hollywood budget aides in creating elaborate scenery, choosing the ideal cast and allowed for amazing post production editing and mastering.  Aside from the technical aspect, its a great story line if you like classic musicals.
B002WJI63A|4.0|Fast service, got what I paid for.  The picture is what I received. I nothing else to write that I can think of.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so awesome if you like the diary of a wimpy kid books or if you like big nate and want to have a laugh you should get this book so you should really get this book.I vote this book five stars.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very entertaining for all ages.  If you like historical fiction this is for you.  Three generations of my family enjoy watching together.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I'm normally more careful and usually read what permissions an app uses.  I ran scan of TrustGo AV (rated no. 1 mobile AV in latest AV-org roundup) and was shocked when this app appeard in warning list.  Then I took a look at the permissions and it made sense.  Why does this paid app need all these permissions, and for an alarm clock, no less?!  And the fact that, as at least one other reviewer noted, there are ads that come up is inexcusable.  Glad i didn't spend more than the dollar cuz i'm UNINSTALLING.  REally, this app didn't even look that great on Fire anyway.  The numbers weren't nearly big enough for a tablet screen.  (unlike the beautiful and free AdyClock that fits android tablets great in both portrait and landscape)
B000O8OTNC|4.0|By no means should my advice be taken as some expert.lol I just wanted a cheap portable way to keep my knives sharp. Honestly I didn't think it would work but it does!!! I love it. I haven't had it that long so I don't know about the test of time but I have used it on everything from camping knives to kitchen knives and it seems to work great :)
B00899F0G8|5.0|Awesome show! It's really fun and entertaining to watch. I got all of my friends hooked! I can't wait until next season.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|The artist Salvador Dali coined a name for his most important paintings- the masterworks. That title equally applies to the most important Beatles' albums. Following the transitional album 'Help', this was the first of the Beatles' greatest albums.<br /><br />For such an influential work, RS is surprisingly understated. Indeed, for decades it was underrated, because it doesn't have the spiky brilliance of 'Revolver', the shining clarity of 'Sgt. Pepper' or the ground-breaking experimentation of the White Album and 'Abbey Road'. However, in the last few years its stock has risen and in the 2012 Rolling Stone list of the 500 greatest albums it has taken its position in the top 5 along with 'Revolver' and 'Sgt. Pepper'.<br /><br />The reasons why it is such a great album, as with most outstanding works of art, are both simple and complex. Simply, it is a wonderful collection of songs. Although these songs weren't intended for single release (and the group released none of them as singles in the UK, although Capitol released 'Nowhere Man' in the US), at least 8 of the Lennon/McCartney songs were good enough to be singles and the two Harrison songs were also top class. 'Michelle' was released by The Overlanders in the UK and went to #1 and no lesser group than The Hollies released Harrison's 'If I Needed Someone' and had a top 20 hit with it. Subsequently, 'In My Life' was voted in one poll as the best pop song ever recorded. Many of the other songs are very familiar and have had cover versions recorded. These are great songs by songwriters who were getting to their absolute peak.<br /><br />However, The Beatles had recorded albums of great songs before. 'A Hard Day's Night' and 'Help' are full of wonderful songs. Where 'Rubber Soul' is different is in the construction of the album, taking the listener on a journey instead of just listening to a collection of individual tracks. It starts with the overall sound; RS has a distinctive sound which creates a mood for the album. It's a warm, slightly folk/country influenced sound. Even when the subject matter of the lyrics is not cheerful, the sound glows like a log fire, making the listener feel comfortable and cosy. In this it's the opposite of the sharp, acidic sound of 'Revolver', which challenges the listener to understand what the songs are saying.<br /><br />Then there's the progression of songs, creating moods and emotions. It starts with comedy, the jokey 'Drive My Car', complete with punchline, followed by the equally amusing but more sinister 'Norwegian Wood'. Then the mood becomes wistful, with the plaintive 'You Won't See Me' leading to the sad story of the 'Nowhere Man'. What could have been just a lament is redeemed by a spark of hope- if the nowhere man can just get his act together, there's a world out there at his command. The following song, the first of Harrison's, tells him what to do- 'Think For Yourself'. That leads into the upbeat 'The Word' and the romantic 'Michelle'. Things are looking up!<br /><br />Not so fast. Ringo asks the question 'What Goes On' and the answer isn't so cheerful; 'Girl' points out that the object of one's affections can be a handful and 'I'm Looking Through You' shows that disillusionment can easily set in.<br /><br />What better way to get over a sad love affair than by remembering good friends and good times and John's beautiful 'In My Life' does just that. Those good times will be here again, The Beatles tell you, and the key is to 'Wait'. Sure enough, a new love turns up to a cautious but optimistic welcome in 'If I Needed Someone'.<br /><br />I'm bound to say that the final track, 'Run For Your Life' is to my mind the weakest link in the album; it's a good song and well-sung by John, but the lyric is violent and bitter and jarring in the context of what has gone before. If the intention was to shake the listener up, then I guess it succeeds, but I'd have preferred a more upbeat lyric at the end of the album.<br /><br />Both George Harrison's songs are strong additions. Moreover, his singing is better on his own songs, so it's a double bonus. Ringo's song is often dismissed, but I like it; he sings it well, it has a nice hook and Paul's harmonies are superb. Moreover, it fits the mood of the album.<br /><br />With its distinctive cover art, 'Rubber Soul' looks and sounds different to what has gone before. It's more than a collection of songs, it's the first Beatles album which takes you to a place of The Beatles' choosing. A masterwork indeed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Any fan of Masterpiece Theater will love this series.  The characters are marvelous, the sets are authentic, and the lifestyle is something we can only dream of.  More, please.
0061438294|5.0|Great book, I found it very usefull, It was wrote in a way you can understand it and have a lot of very clear examples.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the whole trilogy! First one was my favorite by far but loved them all, was sad when i was finished with them but would definately read them again.
B0009HLD0K|3.0|A good movie but I was didn't remember all of it. So it when it came out, long time ago then bought it on a whim. It is OK, nothing to get excited about, enteraining.
B009VB97EY|3.0|The dancing was execellent, but felt the plot lacked.  Glad I watched it though.  The actors did a good job.
B0002YLC24|4.0|This movie holds up to the test of time, like the first it is an good paced movie that isn't to long and has a lot of good scenes and dialog. If you want to see action this isn't for you, it is a thinking persons movie.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I felt the cartoon version from many years ago followed the book better than this &#34;work&#34;.  He can't even match it up with the trilogy he did 10 years ago.  It will no longer make sense.  The CG was pretty cheesy and overdone as well.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is so close to the old Galaxian or Galaga that its unreal. Very fun,  no crazy permissions, simple video game fun!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is great for anyone retiring, planning to retire, or even planning to visit another country.  Great group of British actors.  Because of the many humorous scenes and the interesting story line, my husband (who only likes action movies) even liked this one.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Was fun to play..got stuck a couple times but that graphics and music makes the time go by faster. Great interaction as well
B00003JA7P|4.0|This album has it all.  I wake up and I listen.  I get ready for bed and I listen.  It keeps me musically honest.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I have just started reading this series. I like magic/fantasy stories that are well written. Terry Goodkind has a strong talent for this type of work. I have a Kindle and so I am aware of all the typos and grammar problems with the series but I am not a stupid person, I can fill in the blanks and read the sentences as they were intended. Having said that, I must say that I have no fingernails left to speak of. The first book of the series Wizards First Rule, almost drove me insane I didn't think it could get any more intense. Then I read Stone of Tears and I was actually in tears half the time. I really didn't see how he was going to get out that Palace of the Prophets. I expected more torture like he endured in the first book. Poor Richard, the man can't seem to get a break. He does what is necessary and always gets kicked in the teeth. Sometimes I like Kahlan be sometimes I want to slap her into next week. And then there is Zedd....poor Richard is out there bungling through all these messes without really knowing how to use his magic and Zedd is anywhere but where he should be ...with Richard. I may have a heart attack before I get through Blood of the Fold. It takes a master of storytelling to do this to his readers. I really love the series, but honestly they are not for the faint of heart.
B00AR9GKJY|5.0|There is really nothing bad to be said about this album. At all. Steven Wilson gave us what is easily his best album ever, which was incredibly well produced. Buy this album. Every song is a hit.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was an interest in read. Not what I expected. Love making in so many different ways. Not your average love story. A fast book to read. Graphic but we'll written. Can't wait to read the next one.
B002OEBMNE|5.0|Slayer hasn't lost their touch over the years. This is an incredibly strong album with a very strong track listing. Not a single bad song on this record.
0525478817|5.0|This book is truly amazeing its not your tipical sappy romance about love struck teeny boppers that makes you wannna barf no its so cool how these two bond over cancer!!!!! They did and it was so wonderfull i litterally laughed a couple of times and even got choked up. You will most definattly love this book!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I wouldn't really spend money on games like these, but i got this one for free and it was been nice to play a few levels to unwind after a busy day.
B00328G4XY|5.0|No better Guitarplayer  ever.  Ground breaking cd.  Timeless.  The last official  studio cd  Hendrix made in his lifetime. BUY IT
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Kept me very engrossed from start to finish. Author has a comfortable way of developing your relationship with the characters. I loved the story and look forward to seeing how the movie compares with my imagination.
160774273X|5.0|I've been increasingly interested in home bread baking and pizza making over the last 5 or so years, and have slowly worked my way through many of the more popular books (Reinhart, Lahey, etc).  An acquaintence who is also a home baker strongly recommended I try Forkish' approach, and brought me a loaf to try.  Needless to say, I was impressed and immediately ordered the book.  This weekend, I had my first free day to try a loaf.  The results ?  Not only the best loaf I personally have ever made, but (amazingly) one of the best breads I've ever had - period.<br /><br />Forkish's methods are certainly not what I would call simple, but certainly can be learned quickly.  I found myself relying on the very helpful videos posted on his website to illustrate the techniques in the book and to make sure I understood his method of mixing, folding and shaping.  Luckily I already had most of the equipment he recommends (I used a 6qt dutch oven which was fine, and had a relatively small 7\\" Brotoform - both worked out fine).  Based on the fantastic results of my somewhat confused first attempt, I'll be running out this week to pick up a 12 QT tub and another Brotoform for rising so I can make a few loaves to bring to Easter dinner this week.<br /><br />If you're interested at all in making homemad bread in the style of rustic European loaves, I highly recommend this book.  I can't wait to try some of the more complex recipes, but the good news is that even if you just make the basic \\"Saturday\\" bread (ready on the same day), you'll have fantastic results.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Fun game for my boys aged 5 &amp; 6 to see these cool dragons, but also a rip off! You have to expand your area to move on and have more dragons, but here's what you are up against : First time I tried to expand it cost 2,000 coins. Then the expanding took so long to download (you can download faster if you use gold, but you have to purchase it, it cannot be earned) so ours never did go through. Tried to expand again and now the cost is 4,000 coins and download never finished. Now to expand its 6,000 coins and they make it so slow that you can never actually do it without &quot;speeding up&quot; your download by using gold that has to be purchased! It's not worth it!!!
B00BF11STU|3.0|The story is important, no argument there, and it is told relativley starkly, with little evidence of over the top embellishments of derring do. Nonetheless, I found it too long, boring in sections, and had scenes that made me grit my teeth because of what I considered poor writing, acting, and directing. And I'm leaving aside discusions of whether the &#34;enhanced interrogation&#34; scenes depicted the correct level of importance in the discovery of bin Laden's compound.<br /><br />Good, but we're I voting, I would not have nominated it for any Academy Award considerations.
B004PGO25O|4.0|Ship it. Simple. No it's not. If you have ever done anything worth doing, then you know about resistance. Their is no magic formula in this book. Just Do the Work.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|I liked the first EP and I was very leery about this disk.  It's fantastic.  This band created a masterful CD.  Recommend whoever would like to hear NIN with a female singer.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|and love this CD. Mirrors and Suite & Tie are my favorite. Can't wait for the 2nd part to come out in the fall
B008OOYALE|4.0|great time killer. kids love showing off their new dragons and have talked me into letting them use my kindle so the can play with each others dragons. so cute and keeps them busy for a few minutes.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|Some of the levels are broken and just retarded fun game but i think they should fix a few of the levels
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Great movie. Adult perspective of kid p.o.v. Creative and fun. Surprising cast who looked like they were having a grand time.
1603429999|4.0|I was given some circular knitting needles am kept putting off using them, So with the hep of the book I am slowly getting there, I will get there in the end
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was written to make everybody think of what would happen when you spend all your lives fighting wars that you and people started  and what future might bring.
B000053VJI|5.0|First I am not from the Dominican Republic but I grew up in a heavily populated Dominican community so i grew up on their culture and i grew up listening to all these songs blasting in bodegas and in cars and anywhere you can think of. This is that good merengue from back in the day. He has some salsa songs too.  If you are a Juan Luis Guerra fan like I am you will love this cd. YOu cannot go wrong with this cd. He is an amazing and very respected Dominican artist and his music is joy and poetry.  There are no longers songs and artists like him nowadays! You want romatic songs on a merengue melody this CD has it too! Este disco es perfecto ordenalo ya! Saludos a todos los Dominicanos aunque yo no lo soy pero tienen un lugar especial en mi corazon!
0525423281|5.0|Dolores Nolan (better known as Lola) is a seventeen year old budding fashion designer. Vowing to never wear the same outfit twice in a calendar year, her clothes are often somewhat eccentric but always an original. Her two dads hate her twenty-two year old on the verge of becoming a rockstar boyfriend, Max. Her birth mother is a fortune telling mess and the Bell twins, Cricket and Calliope, with whom Lola has a feud have just moved back in next door. Senior year is shaping up  nicely... and it hasn't even started yet.<br /><br />Trying to navigate through family issues and wardrobe dilemmas, Lola is just trying to make it though. But Cricket keeps popping up all over the place. In the street, in stores Lola's frequenting - Cricket even turns up at the cinema where Lola works! After what happened two summers before, Lola doesn't know if she can trust him. But feelings become involved and Lola becomes conflicted. Should she choose the hot glamorous older rocker Max or Cricket - the boy next door.<br /><br />I loved Anna and the French Kiss and the main reason I picked up a copy of Lola was because I'd heard there was a guest appearance of Anna and St. Clair. I'm glad I decided to read Lola's story because it's just as adorable and sweet as Anna's French Kiss.<br /><br />Lola is fun. She's quirky and adventurous  It's not just her fashion sense that's colourful. Her family life was such a delightful contrast to that of Anna's - her dads set curfews, rules regarding boyfriends and keep an eye on just who is coming and going from their daughter's bedroom. Her mother is an interesting character who had a very interesting relationship with Lola. I loved how they all interacted with each other - it felt authentic. Lola's own personal conflict was more than just her love life. She becomes confused to whether it's the girl who makes the costumes or the costumes who make the girl.<br /><br />And then there's the boys in Lola's life. Max - whom everyone from her best friend Lindsay to her parents and even her colleagues at the cinema thinks is too old for her. I loved the contrast that he provided for Cricket. Oh Cricket. I have so many adjectives I could use to describe this character (who I absolutely adored) but I think the one that fits best is awkward. He's delightfully awkward. In that way that makes him go from a nerd to geek chic in my eyes. I'm a sucker for romantic gestures and Cricket's conversations and general adorableness was the kind that made my heart feel like it had grown five sizes from reading it. He's just that dorky romantic soul that I love reading about.<br /><br />Anna and St. Clair make a few appearances in this book and whilst it was great to see them again (and that was the main reason why I decided to read this book) there was something about their scenes that felt a little odd to me. It's interesting to see a relationship that blossomed from their point of view to all of a sudden being on the outside looking in. They have certainly matured - both as people and with regards to their relationship. I have to admit that I didn't enjoy reading about their romance as much as I did in their own book but I thought it was a lovely way to tie their story to Lola's.<br /><br />This book was a joy to read. I loved the romance and the characters. The leads were sweet and fun and the supporting characters kept things interesting and the plot moving along. Isla and the Happily Ever After comes out in September and I know for sure that I'll be purchasing a copy.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love the colors and it's function. I used it this weekend. Love the sounds to choose from, and it has music as well if you choose to upgrade which I did but nothing happened. The numbers are large, in blue. It gives you the date and day of the week. The temperature is another great feature. In order to use this clock, you have to keep the Kindle on. I would keep it plugged in order to use this clock. I would recommend it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie does an excellent job of teaching the importance of accepting people for who they really are and not just by the way they look or behave. It also sends a clear message about loving and accepting yourself.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I gave City of Glass 5 stars because it was an excellent closure to my other 2 books, (City of bones and City of Ashes) yet they were able to left enough &#34;lines &#34; open to carry on with the story, I am actually reading now, &#34;City of Fallen Angels&#34; thanks and due the interest that City of Glass created about the story.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Let's start by stating that Justin Timberlake steals the show in this film.  Amy Adams is pretty good too, but Clint?, Somewhat painful to watch.  I always loved the old Clint Eastwood westerns and chafed when people said he was a bad actor.  Then he directs a string of great films in which he doesn't act.  I was proud for him.  He should go back to that.  In this film, he just growls and is ornery, in essence, the exact same character as in Gran Torino.  Time to retire from acting.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I spent the first part of this book with my mouth gaping open! I was blushing to start, but by the end, I was curious to see what would happen next. Quite an unexpected and wonderful surprise.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I really liked this movie and Ethan Hawke did an excellent job in this thriller! The ending was great too...a surprise.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|There was so much action packed into the the pages. I devoured this installment so fast that I had to reread it to make sure I captured it all! :o)
B007REW8DO|5.0|I am so glad I bought this CD. I loved the song &#34;Forever&#34; from breaking Dawn 2 and was immediately drawn in by Christina's voice. Forever isnt on this CD but Jar of Hearts among other fantastic songs make this a very great buy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a wonderful final installment of the trilogy. I didn't want it to end. I would love to visit with these characters again, someday.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app...it works great and one thing I love about it ...is that when u set an alarm it tells u how long u have till it goes off!
B00A77II0U|4.0|Very cool app so far...purchased tonight and have been playing for an hour when I should be asleep already but couldn't stop and wanted more!  The visuals are amazing and storyline is interesting and keeps your attention.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have long been a fan of Sherlock Holmes. This provides the stories I enjoy in one place, as well as material new to me.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I really love this movie, the relationship between Ryan and Tatum was awesome. She was a good child actor, and cute
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|It covered a very sensitive subject.  Many individuals go through a middle age crisis affecting their marriage and this dipected a head on way one individual dealt with the change.
B0019GO5DC|4.0|It is an awesome movie. I liked it as a teenager and I still like it as an adult. The underdog won.
B00001QEE2|4.0|my kids love it and so do I.has a scratch but it playswithout skipping so it is a keeper for sure
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really really think that this is a very good game because it is fun trying not to run into things and I really like on like holidays the cop dresses up for what ever the holiday is that is what I like about this game subway surfers.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Saw the movie. Had to own it. LOVE, Love, LOVED it. Even got my husband to watch it and he liked it. Highly reccommended
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is the best free game I have ever played. It's cool that game is never ending.<br />Definitely a game to download..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was happy there were hints, I needed them. As for all the whining, STOP IT. Almost all of G5 games are this way, I like this form of play before pay. I always read the reviews, it seems that few people can form their own opinion anymore. Even if the game was entirely free, people would still complain ; it's to short, easy, hard, etc.<br />  Well then, enough of my whining, lol, loved the app, &amp; will continue purchases from G5 :)
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|It works well.  It is easy to use.  I have started to use it more and more.  This is a very good app.
0785152458|5.0|can't say much since it was a gift. some will like it others won't......what else can i say? bye bye

B0050DIWFC|4.0|An interesting novel about something that could really happen.  I especially liked the author's development of the individual parents' take on their don's innocence or guild and how they coped with their suspicions.
B0063IH60K|4.0|To play this game, I have to turn my phone data off to avoid constant interruption by obnoxious ads; otherwise okay.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical Grisham.  I found it interesting and fast moving.  This, once again, proves that crime simply does not pay. They always get you....sooner or later!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this!  Wanted to read it before I saw the movie, and I'm glad I did.  Easy quick read, but still a great book.  Would recommend!!! :)
030758836X|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Flynn does a wonderful job of making Nick sympathetic despite his many flaws and the unreliable aspect if his narration. I've read Flynn's other books, but this is certainly her finest.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Skyfall possesses its own distinctive 007 flavor without deviating too far off the 007 course. It's lighter on the overt marketing shots and gadgetry that usual.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a beautiful book! The story and images and dialogue will stay with me a long time, I'm sure. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are such wonderful characters. \\"Life is not a wish granting factory.\\" You're right, John Green, but if I could wish a perfect book, this might just be it.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|I was convinced by the many complaints that I wouldn't enjoy this book. I couldn't have been more wrong. It was a one sitting read because I couldn't put it down. Every supposition is supported by irrefutable facts but more than that I laughed out loud too many times. It's clever witty funny honest and heartfelt.  I shed a tear or two also. Every son and daughter must read this book. Like Oprah I wish I had a couple hundred copies to give to women who have inspired me and to women I want to egg on to Lean In.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A very good read! Hard to put the book down once beginning to read it. Very entertaining and not at all predictable.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We picked this movie for family movie night. We all really liked it. It was a funny and heart warming story about our kids growing up letting them go. My kids laughed out loud many times and have watched it multiple times. Definitely a great choice for the whole family!
B00899F0G8|5.0|Love love love this series!!! My daughter and I are so excited every Tuesday night.  Sad that we had season finale last week but can't wait for new season
B00336C3EY|4.0|This was a great movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon.  The story line made you re-evaluate your life; what your goals were and who in your life was helping support your goals.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie for a date.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Purchased this on a recommendation from a friend.  I found it cumbersome and confusing.  Does not come with a user's guide and is definitely not intuitive.  After much frustration I deleted it and went back to using the stock PDF Reader on the Kindle Fire.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie totally deserved to win Best Picture.  I didn't know much about this historical event and the movie helped put into context the emotions and environment that history books could not.<br /><br />It was filled with action, thrill, emotion, and suspense.  I recommend this movie for anytime.
B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|While this felt more like a high budget mini series than a stand alone movie, it felt like a great visit with old friends for those who loved the Rings Trilogy. Well done and thorough.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We just saw Life of Pi  ,I can see why it won academy awards in cinematography and direction. Ang Lee has done an in credible job ,what a beautiful creation,this film is a real gift.
1455508977|3.0|This book was easy to get through, and the story somewhat engaging. Predictable, but ends the way you want it to end. I usually don't like books like that, but sometimes when it's wrapped up all neat and tidy at the end it leaves you feeling satisfied.<br /><br />The characters are very one-dimensional, but if you happen to have it sitting in your shelf (like I did), go ahead and pick it up.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Loved it took me back to the 80's.Definitely a comedy thrill ride.Tom Cruise was believable as a rock star.Everyone did a great job,Alec Baldwin was hilarious.The singing,dancing everything was worth watching.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A carefully crafted story which holds attention throughout. Well-researched psychological issues woven seamlessly into the tapestry of the tale maintain the suspense to the end
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice fun game, buy rather addictive.  Can't beat it for a free game.  Keep playing and you get more coins as well as better prizes.  Don't spend your prizes on coins, save them for level ups.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|Their music is upbeat, fun, and easy to get into.There is so much talent with this group that their videos alone are worth watching. I recommend anyone to review their other music! Most of their cover songs are so much better than their originals.
