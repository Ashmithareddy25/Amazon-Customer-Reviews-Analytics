1414303394|2.0|I read \\"The Christmas Carol\\" in its original, unabridged text every Christmas season. Outstanding writing and word usage, to say the least. Moving descriptions within a theme that is, well, \\"the theme of our time\\". I unwrapped this CD eagerly and started the CD player. NOT unabridged, I quickly discovered...and much to my disappointment. I'll save it for my grandson as an early experience of this Dicken's work. The experience left me asking: how could they advertise thisd CD as \\"UNABRIDGED\\"? Does anyone have an answer to that? Please?
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Let's face it - this had no chance of beating The Dark Knight.  I'd also have to rate it a tiny bit below the Batman Begins movie.  But still, even as the weakest of the three, it stands very high in movies released in 2012.  If you enjoyed the first two, you'll watch this.  If not, don't bother.
B002C949KE|5.0|The author provides, at times humorous and at times serious, but always insightful, analysis of 'human instincts'. This book DOES NOT teach you to exploit the instinctive behavior for selling your stuff or having your way. What I like about this book is that it promotes and suggests ways of making positive impact on our lives and the society at large - for example, self-control credit card that may make lives of individuals less miserable and profits of banks less obscene. The analysis of when and how market norms vs social norms affect our behavior is intriguing. All in all, this book will be a thrilling read for anyone trying to understand how human instincts work and how they shape our decisions.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar 3D really does shine and shows just how deep a movie in 3D can take the viewer.<br />The thing I really admire about this release is just how tastefully the 3D is pulled off. Their is a great field of depth,with just enough pop out scenes to really dazzle your senses. Their is no doubt that Pandora has never been more alive,than when witnessing it's beauty on the 3D format. If this renaissance of 3D continues,I can't wait to see what film makers bring us next.<br /><br />So what are the drawbacks if any?<br /><br />Well despite how marvelous this movie looks in 3 dimensions their are a few things I think are worthy of nitpicking over.<br />First and foremost is the fact that a few sparse moments of this presentation are still 2D. Their not long shots,mostly close ups of Jake Sully in human form that last no more than a few seconds.<br /><br />The next point may not apply to everyone but I'm still going to throw it out their. While watching this film in 3D I noticed the only color options my tv allows are standard and movie (vizio 42inch). I personally love watching this film in bright colors (Dynamic,vivid). The 3D more than makes up for this however,and I feel the pro's outweigh the cons in this department.<br /><br />The final drawback comes with the PS3 controls. I can't use the square bottom to return to the main menu. Instead I have to press triangle, and open up the bigger menu to return. It's not a big drawback,but a small minor inconvenience.<br /><br />In conclusion, Avatar 3D is I believe,the standard for 3D movies to come. It never tries too hard,nor does it have to in order to hook you in. The only movie, i believe that comes close to being an equal rival is Avengers 3D.
0316228532|5.0|I love it, T<br /><br />The seller personally shipped it fast, and added a note inside, which was very nice.<br />The book is a good read as I just love J.K. Rowling.<br /><br />Great price and in perfect condition, it is a great buy.

B00913DPW2|1.0|The game freezes A LOT!! It is too difficult. Not a good story line. The mini games are tedious and too difficult. I thought I would love this game since I love hidden object mystery games. It was a flop!! Wasted my 1.99. Played the game for a while hoping it would get better. It just kept getting worse. Did not finish it. Very disappointed!! Deleted off my kindle fire!!!
B000NY12CI|4.0|I read this book non-stop.  I had always been fascinated about Islamic culture and wanted to know about it more.

B004SBX112|1.0|This \\"update\\" removed all of the previous years games and ALL of my progress! It actually reverted back to last years version and removed the previous year! Now there are only a few \\"seasons\\" left from this year only. I'm SOooo tired of starting over with horrible, glitchy and failed updates from Amazon. These are only games. It's supposed to be fun! I'm done. I've learned my lesson from Amazon. I don't want the game anymore, I just want my money back.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I remember when this movie was priced over or near $100 dollars and because I had saw it on regular dvd I wondered what the big deal was.Then the price dropped(I bought mine at Fryes for $25 total)and I bought the blu ray 3d version.Man what a TOTAL difference that made.Beautiful colors,great 3d made this a classic that I will show to company & re-watch.The forest is just beautiful!! This movie is affordable now and a must have for any 3D collection !! I see why so many people paid the $100 for it(i can't afford it but I understand),its a one of a kind visual adventure.
B004SBX112|2.0|Once again, an angry birds app for Kindle finally comes out and when it installs it wipes out all your previous scores with no notice. Seasons is also notorious for being a bit too exact to ba able to get that 3rd star, making it more frustrating.

B009WO7NQO|4.0|from THE LOOKS, I think it looks awesome! but... I don't have the game because its all, ooo I don't know... 2.99 ! so... I suggest to &quot;Rovio Entertainment Ltd.&quot;  that they should make a free one for views!<br /><br />  ----Joseph Kozdra reviews
B009NPKTN6|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.  The story is not deep, the acting not perfect, but if you experienced the 80's and the music of that era you should enjoy this.  The singing is excellent.  Keep a lighthearted attitude about it and enjoy!
1423140605|5.0|My 14 year old has read the entire series, and couldn't wait for this newest addition. When she finishes one of the books, she passes it along to me. They have all been well-written, interesting to me as an adult, and age-appropriate.

0307960471|2.0|I have enjoyed the Harry Hole series, but there has been a downward progression in the character presentation, plotting, and detail. This one was really a disappointment. Here, the plot is compressed with one action tic rapidly following another, rather like a fireworks display. I wasn't motivated to keep chasing the action, and found it boring. Harry Hole himself is a superman here, absorbing impossible punishment, holding his fatal wounds together with duct tape without ill effect only to have the wounds miraculously go away. Oh, and he never sleeps for days on end while moving though the days on full thrust. Then there are the annoying wrong details (Cartridges 9x17 vs. 9x18 vs. 9x19) and the impossible details (inhaling air from a glass whiskey bottle whilest underwater). Maybe Nesbo just did the book in a hurry. Really too bad.

B009WO7NQO|2.0|I am a big angry birds fan so at first I thought this app would be for me. I have all of the other angry birds apps and I even have two game guides!! Since I didn't have the cash on me I figured I'd get it for Christmas. That was UNTIL I saw the reveiws. Apparently a lot of people had trouble downloading which is upsetting if you're just paying for a mess up. The app didn't seem that pricy at first since it had HD graphics. However it turns out you're app is only prepaid because you have to buy additional things. The worst thing about it is that other devices get a free version yet we don't. I had the same reaction when I found out I couldn't get the .99 version of &quot;ANGRY BIRDS SPACE&quot;. Once they fix the bugs and make a cheaper version maybe I will rethink my decision. But until ROVIO cleans this up BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!
B0091REZMW|2.0|This game is only free for 15 minutes.  One is required to continue to purchase tokens to play.  It would be great if not for free play being g only 2 minutes a day!
B009WJ2XT6|4.0|I've been reading the negative music  comments. I saw the film tonight at it's san francisco opening. This film is extremely dramatic and exciting, and I believe that the overuse of music cues that \\"remind \\" you that you're watching a Bond movie would do nothing for this film. The occasional familiar cues do drop in...but they underscore a kind of nod to the history, and don't take you out of this compelling film. It's what's making this new series of Bond films so satisfying...they are tougher, and simply stronger than the older films. It's a style that stays in your gut after the film is over...like a good spy film should. So, I think the music holds the film together, and doesn't elbow you with reminders. If you are like me who does like some good groove on the big screen, the piece Shanghai Drive and it's clone Adrenaline will satisfy you. I just bought both. Adrenaline is used in the end titles.<br />The movie was extremely entertaining. The crowd was locked in tight. The intro of a familiar mechanical creature later in the film drew nothing but cheers. Javier Bardem was marvelous as the villain, and the script is excellent. Go have some fun, and stay out of tiny theaters with tiny screens. This is a knockout to look at.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|I rented this through Amazon on demand and the sound quality was horrible. When watching regular TV I have the sound volume set at 14. With this movie I had to set the volume all the way up to 30. Even then we had to lean forward to hear the dialogue. Forget all of the action scenes. They were no louder than a conversation. Surround sound didn't help. This ruined a great movie and turned me off to ever using Amazon to stream again. They still haven't responded to my original complaint I filed weeks ago.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love the game and the newest update has it closer to the PC version, but having to buy a new copy each time really blows. I payed $7 for it on my phone, now I have to pay another $7 to put it on my tablet when they both use the android os and same market...

B009WO7NQO|4.0|if you like star wars get it. its pretty fun. lol. i do have to agree with everyone though, this version is good but it is more about the money this time. 2 worlds, 1 free world coming soon, and the rest u have to buy on top of the $3 you already spent on the game.. :/
B007REV4T8|2.0|Daniel Craig is a marvelous actor. He just shouldn't be playing Bond, who was dark, sophisticated, and all that sort. Craig looks like an East End working class drunkard, no matter how much one might cover him in Tom Ford. In Skyfall, the new \\"tradition\\" of completely impossible to survive cartoon violence continues, which should delight that part of the audience still in need of acne treatments. The villain is more interesting than Bond, but is a little too cutesy for the appropriate level of menace. Hopkins pulled it off as Lecter, our man Javier, who himself mastered the art of menace in No Country for Old Men, comes up rather short here. Spoiler here: The one bright spot of the film is when M is finally knocked off. Dame Dench was more appropriate as M's mother, than M. Hopefully they won't bring her back to life. The original flavor of Bond is dead with the Craig franchise.  The original flavor of the Fleming Novels doesn't even get a chance to breathe. Also, two hours and twenty three minutes of chase, bang, chase, morose reflection, mate, chase, bang, etc.? Oh for the days of Peter Hunt on the cutting room floor. There are some great individual scenes in this movie. All it needs is a more sophisticated plot, more interesting women (as were found in Casino Royale), and some realistic violence. However see it, because we are told in the credits James Bond Will Return anyway, and this fifty year old franchise deserves some respect, even if it is turning into a Tom and Jerry cartoon with chicks and three dimensional pyrotechnics.

B000NI8F5G|5.0|The film:<br />For me, this movie epitomizes the MGM musical: pure, absolute, feel-good fluff, produced by incredibly talented performers. And don't get me wrong, feel-good fluff is not meant to be pejorative. Singin' in the Rain is the type of movie that one can watch multiple times in a row, as an adult, while marveling at Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds' dancing and singing along to the iconic, catchy tunes.<br /><br />The DVD:<br />Even though it says my review is for the instanst video, I also purchased the ten dollar 60th Anniversary two-disc DVD set, and it is an unbelievable value! The documentaries included on the second disc are long (up to 60 minutes!) and infotaining. As a special features junkie, I couldn't really ask for more; in my opinion, the special features included with this ten dollar(!) DVD are a lot more special than the ones included with many of my more expensive two-disc classics.<br /><br />In short, if you haven't seen the movie, watch it! And if you don't own it yet, buy it!

140053271X|4.0|The Nook Simple Touch is a great little e-reader. It's easy to use and displays books well. It handles pdf files better than my husband's Sony T1 reader, which I have been delighted by as I often get review copies of books in pdf format.<br /><br />The built-in WiFi is only used to access the Nook store and sync your digital library between B&N's servers and your reader.<br /><br />The only feature I would like would be a built-in web browser. It would be nice to be able to get on the local library's digital library with my reader directly instead of having to download the files to my computer first.
1400067936|4.0|By Mayur Patel<br /><br />How We Are All Fools of Randomness<br /><br /> This book was not the simplest book I have ever read, but very insightful for the market trader/investor.  I will provide a little insight of my own into the realm of Nassim Taleb. I enjoyed the fact that the author explained concepts of the financial nature in the most basic manner. For a person not to savvy in financial terminology the book was readable, it was actually other topics that the author randomly introduced that was a little harder to read.  The book is about how people, who invest in or trade in the market, fail or succeed due to factors outside of their control. The author brings to light many concepts that people more often than not overlook. The author provides countless examples to break his concepts down into a comprehensible level. One point that is emphasized throughout the book is that most people fall into a trap of luck.<br />Taleb started his book by introducing Solon, a Greek legislator. He began his book with Solon, because of Solon's wisdom, \\"...to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has[guaranteed] continued happiness until the end we may call happy.\\"(Taleb 3). Then the author explained how people could do everything right, but still fail. This was due to a randomness factor. These factors can be a natural disaster, an election, a terrorist attack, etc. People can crunch every number in the world to until their fingers bleed, but still fail. People can have tips and inside knowledge, but still fail. The author stresses this idea of randomness and repetitively intertwines it into the different scenarios presented into this book. The beginning of the book, the concept of randomness was introduced via two characters Nero and John. Taleb shows how randomness affects both characters that are of opposite mindsets. He later tells of how people's decisions are affected by emotions. He demonstrates this by telling of an experiment done, where a person is alleviated from his emotions. The emotion stricken person was not even able to complete the simplest tasks. The author spoke of emotions, because without it people would get nothing accomplished, on the other hand, with emotions, people can act irrationally which leads to bad decisions. The author makes his position on journalist in his field quite clear. Without hesitation, his detestation for journalist simmered throughout the pages. The author does not agree with journalist, because they are people who are inexperienced in the financial field, yet write about it; they fail to understand randomness. Then their idiocracy(yes I know this is made up, but fits the situation so well) is then consumed by their readers, who take the written fallacies to heart, which can lead to inadequate decisions. Next, Taleb speaks of a Monte Carol engine, which I have gathered as something to produce data of scenarios ran a countless amount of times, with random situations passed into the scenarios every time.  The author preferred Monte Carlo methods, because he could care less about the ideas behind mathematics, but only the application. I found this a little intriguing that a person that is so knowledgeable in the financial field, which deals mainly with numbers, does not care for the properties of mathematics. The next topic the author presents is the association of Darwinism and companies. Companies cannot be viewed in the survival of the fittest manner, because the Darwinian ideas cannot and do not accommodate for randomness, which we learn from this book is a big part of the business world. Randomness can be either good or bad, essentially it will all come down to luck. A person will be either lucky or unlucky, but the author explains that eventually it will reverse itself and the unlucky will become lucky and the lucky become unlucky. Taleb introduces manysignificant subject matter experts throughout the book to support his claim of people being fooled by randomness.<br /><br /> I feel as if the author was a bit random himself. The way the text was presented seemed a little unorthodox to me. The author would present a subject, talk about it, provide examples about it, but then the next topic would be totally off on some other tangent, while all in the same chapter. I'm not even sure if everything written in the book could be tied back to randomness in some manner, but that I will go ahead and assume is to be blamed on my inexperience on the subject matter. The structure of the book is one thing I did not agree with. Although, this is the style of writing the author may have intended. I believe the book was well conversed and definitely and eye opener. Taleb did well in explaining complex material in a simplified fashion. I enjoyed all of the examples presented in the book; I felt they gave the book some character. I understand I cannot be considered a person well versed in the financial world, so everything written here completely opinion based. The main piece of knowledge I can confidently say I have gained from this book is that there is nothing that can be done to tame this unforgiving beast that is randomness.<br /><br /> For a book whose topic is of a subject that, I believe, many would consider of a dull nature was quite interesting. The book kept my interest with its comprehensible examples and insightful views. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone that has dealings in the economic world. Actually, I honestly believe this book could just about relate to anyone and everyone, because randomness is part of everyone's lives. I did not ever consider randomness to ever be as big of a factor in life as, I know it is, now. I will take the knowledge gained from reading this book and hopefully put it to good use.

0062082353|5.0|The story is told by Chris and his wife from their points of view.  Its shows that Chris is not the only one dealing with struggles, there are struggles stateside too.  It shows the strength of the SEALs and their families.  At the beginning of the book I started to get restless with how slow the book was moving.  I learned to appreciate this because it tells the whole story of Chris so you know him as a person, not just as a SEAL Sniper.  You become thankful there are men like him watching the back of the troops.  Chris is very honest in this book.  He tells stories about problems with the law, with his marriage, mistakes he makes and losses along the way.  A part of me was sad the book was over but also glad he was back home and out of Iraq. FYI, 100% of the money Chris receives from the book, he forwards to the families of the two guys lost in the book.  What a great American.

0465068367|1.0|This is an important event in world history. As such, it deserves an accurate, rational accounting of what happened.  You won't get that here.  I was assigned this as a research topic in a graduate program.  I had not previously studied to any degree the Pacific theatre of WWII, and knew nothing detailed of these events.  Further, I had no stake personal or otherwise in the outcome of my research.  The same can't remotely be said for Chang.<br /><br />Fortunately, you don't have to get very far into Chang's book before she reveals the dripping bias behind her writing.  Very early on, the author recounts how she got turned onto the topic by \\"Chinese activists\\".  From that point on, Nanking would be an emotionally charged crusade for Chang.  Do you really need to know any more?  Well, if you do, you will read hyperbolic accounts of these events written through the emotionally charged lens of Chang's personal outrage, fed by a steady diet of activism.  Others have addressed the selective captioning of misleading photographs.  What I want to make clear before I continue is that I am not saying there were no atrocities committed by the IJA.  Clearly, there were.  But if one end of the spectrum is that nothing happened, the other extreme is that only the absolute worst case did.  In that regard, Chang's work represents that other extreme.  Having researched the subject personally, in any given situation where there are a range of possible casualty figures, Chang routinely selects the worst possible case.  In assessing situations, Chang always goes with the worst possible rumor or outcome or motive.  Her hatred for the Japanese is palpable, and it renders this book all but useless as an accurate historical account of these events.  Best case, it could represent a sort of timeline and suggest other sources to examine, but you will DEFINITELY want to invest your time in reading some other book for a level-headed account of what happened in Nanking. Chang's book is sensationalized journalism, not good history.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I just really enjoy the show.  I wait for it to come out every year because I don't get the channel.  It's worth the wait.
0385536828|2.0|I thought this would be a story of a clever young spy for MI5. Instead it was a story about a young woman who made decisions at every turn based on misplaced adulations of influential men. I guess the narrator's introduction set up the disappointing career from the beginning, but I did not find the character of Serena Frome at all appealing. The end of the novel does explain why she's portrayed as such a twit, but I still didn't find wading through all the electricity-challenged, polluted 1970s Britain to get there.
B001QFZADA|5.0|This book is an eye opener!  The information conveyed gives hope for the \\"clueless\\" regarding love languages - a way to communicate the fact that one cares.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I like this better then all the standard story lines uptodate. And the directors cut had those great parts missed  in the theater version.
B007SGM084|4.0|I recomend these books to every women. Teach your husbands, boyfriends, partners what you have learned through the pages of these 3 books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave the  book 5 stars because it was like no other book I have read before in a good way I mean I even when I'm done reading the book I read it again and again!!!:)
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Brilliant brillian brilliant went on and bought the soundtrack would definately recommend will watch over and over again again and again
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|ok,  so I buy the game and start playing it after the tenth checkpoint I die and die. this game is fun and hard and I know what you're thinking &quot; oh good a hard game&quot; no. this game is so insanley hard its almost impossable to get passed anything besides the first couple obsticules with out using a slow mo.which I remind you you have a limited supply of * sigh* . good game but really, turn down the difficulty a notch or TWO HUNDRED!!!!!!!!
B001WCN232|4.0|This is a very good album, Star Star censored or otherwise. I would give it five stars were it not for the shameful treatment Richards and Jagger handed to the guitar genius behind the album, Mick Taylor. His slide guitar on Winter and work on 100 Years alone make this album well worthwhile. I have been a Stones fan since 1964 and I hope one day Jagger and Richards will have the balls to give credit to Taylor for making this the great album it truly is. And, to refer to Taylor anytime as \\"strictly a guest\\" as Richards did for the upcoming concerts only shows these old guys still have significant insecurities. For anyone interested in great guitar playing, buy the album.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is not just another big brother story. These books manage to convey such a theme as if you are walking down each level of the silo yourself. Each landing a revealing a new secret, keeping you glued to the book as you put the pieces together. The characters are so human and develop throughout the story as they meet new challenges. I would suggest this book to any reader who likes to think outside the box.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Okay, Rovio did it again. It's amazing! The perfect blend of Angry Birds Space and Star Wars. Plus it has a much better storyline and it's fun to pick out the different parts of the movie in the game. Now all we need is Angry Birds Lord of the Rings with arrows,  swords, magic, and a Sauron piggy...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is the best game ever.l love it. It goes on and on with all the dots.it is good for your brain.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome books. Very well written.  I would highly recommend them. E.L James is an excellent writer. She keeps the reader interested the whole time. Once you start reading them it is hard to stop.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|This set is pretty cool, for the most part.  The movies are awesome, in my opinion, and everything that comes with it is cool, too.  The only issue I have is the packaging.  The book is very cool, but I still can't get over the packaging of the discs.  I'm just not a fan of having to slide the discs out of the slots that they come in.  It's impossible (for me, at least) to get the discs out without putting my fingers on the business end of the disc, which I never like to do.  The issues I have, though, are nowhere near enough for me to not recommend this set.  If you love these movies as much as I do, it's worth the small hassle.
6304712499|4.0|It was pretty great. I remember seeing it as a kid in the 90's and even today its pretty sick to watch.<br />It was a birthday present for my cousin and she loved it too. Now they just need to make a second one or new one for todays era.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. It offers me my local weather with a great deal of detail an accuracy that I can always relay on.
1451662432|5.0|Such an inspirational story of hard work, discipline and a great attitude!<br />Story follows Arnold's life from birth to present and is almost like a road map for success.<br />Worth every cent.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|Purchased this for my younger cousin and it is a very detailed model for a good price. Comes with additional weapons that can be swapped which increases the play value.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo and this app is great!  I run out of credits way too fast but that only keeps me coming back each day to play!
B004QX07G4|3.0|No defined storyline. Thought it would be more about her life with Portia. Less time on pointless stories. But still funny
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very captivating book. It was a great coming of age story. I've recommended it, and enjoyed it very much. It was sad, but that made it more relateable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyable read - now on the second book of the trilogy and anticipating the third. Definately worth the purchase for my Kindle.
B008Y1YKE4|4.0|We purchased this movie the day it came out on DVD and my daughter has enjoyed watching it at least 3 times since.  I think this will become a classic christmas movie that we watch in our home each year just like &#34;The Polar Express.&#34;  I really liked the story it told about family dynamics and the idea that just because someone is expected to fill a role doesn't mean it is best for them or others.  It gives a cute look at christmas today and how Santa would utilize magic and technology to get toys to all the children on Christmas Eve.  I would recommend this movie to others for the holiday season.
B007THA4FI|2.0|the book was boring and difficult to finish. Characters are confusiong and difficult to keep straight. the plot is actually rather dull and nothing that keeps you reading until the end. Several times I put it down not planning to finish it. I hope she tries again in writing another novel.
B005VPRG10|5.0|Product came quickly and in good condition.  My grandson loves it and plays with it a lot.  He is a big fan of Lego prducts
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Characters are well developed and each week just leaves you wanting more. It is very intense to see the characters that you have watched the last three years become zombies and then killed off. I wonder if Carl really shot his mom
0007466064|5.0|Well, what can I say? I've read all books in the saga and even saw 2 HBO serials, which are based on this epic and very well done. I love this saga and my only concern is that this books contain too many secondary characters  and as result it's not easy to follow the events. Still I was very happy that two important women: Lady knight and Lady Catelyn are still alive despite their wounds and hopefully will get some peace which both of them need. Very interesting that kind princess who was able to raise the dragons can't govern her kingdom the way she wants to, despite her popularity and loyal servants. Her Right needs Might, but she can't obtain the<br />powerful friends, because she can't compromise her principals... I am rooting also for John Snow and his two sisters to get back their kingdom and join their younger brothers and mother. Waiting for the next book with a passion!

B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is a blast. BUT IF YOU Plan on getting a Kindle Fire and playing this game on it...DON'T. Kindle fire players DO NOT GET UPDATES, no Special Editions, it's terrible. Just a warning.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie is awesome. i loved the fact that the filmmakers were able to get real navy seals to be in this film. it made the movie more real. i just loved the action and the guy who played the main villian was great. this movie i one of the best war films i've seen in a long time. it's a must see. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0345803485|2.0|Up until recently, I thought I was the only woman on earth who had not read this book, so I bit the bullet and tackled it. I am not sure what all the commotion was about. This is simply a sweet little love story with a lot of sex scenes.  Frankly, I thought it was a bit of a waste of time and I found myself skimming the pages near the end just to get it over with. The book ends in a cliffhanger, but I know enough people who have read the others in the series to know how it all turns out.  I'm done
0525951652|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. The author is a genius in pacing ordinary people in the core of historic events. His knowledge of the everyday lives of both the ordinary and elite is fabulous.

6305511055|5.0|It was very suspenseful.  I enjoyed it.  I love Robert Redford.  I thought the acting was very good. I love the movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not a typical John Grisham book in my opinion.  Has some chapters that are just to boring and long.  I love John Grisham but this is not a normal work for him.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|this is probably what he would have composed for the new Steven Spielberg film.<br /><br />There are a few other - more detailed - reviews already of this film, which doesn't open for another week (as I write this) so I haven't seen the film yet but am basing my review on the CD. Fellow reviewer \\"Keith\\" has detailed each of the 17 tracks on the 59-minute album, so I won't re-hash that either but will refer you to it.<br /><br />Unlike most - if not all - of the previous reviewer, I didn't come to this disc because of John Williams. I like Williams music - and own quite a few of his popular scores - but I often find his music sounds a lot like his earlier pieces. (Don't beat on me Williams's fans. Listening is subjective.). I found this score different, however, and have enjoyed listening to it twice so far.<br /><br />When I first put on the CD I thought I was listening to the kind of noble patriotic score you hear behind network election results or the PBS News Hour. It was majestic. Then I began to hear American folk music in the mix as it progressed. There was a \\"fiddle\\" and a \\"banjo\\"; not what you expect from Williams. (Note that I said \\"fiddle\\", not violin - an instrument Williams used to great advantage for \\"Schindler's List\\" - probably my favorite Williams score. Yes, the French horn comes in later and sounds beautiful. The track titled \\" The Race To The House\\" is definitely one that would fit on folk music radio, and a few others have that \\"Americana\\" touch. Williams occasionally interpolates traditional folk music into the score, just like Copeland did. I had to feel that Copeland's composition; \\"A Lincoln Portrait\\" had some influence on his writing of this score.<br /><br />Nearly all the \\"chapters\\" last about four minutes, while \\"The Petersen House and Finale\\" clocks in at 11 minutes.<br /><br />I'll see how this score integrates in the film when it opens in theaters but, as a stand alone album, I've been enjoying this, somewhat \\"folksy\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I had a Finn and interesting time playing this game.the only problem is that the game slightly pushes you to buy there things. overall I like this game allot.
B0030MKGKY|4.0|A lot of the reviews of this movie focus on whether it's true to life. I frankly comment, although some of their comments seem pretty picky and trivial (e.g., that the soldiers in this movie don't say \\"hooha\\" enough). I'll leave the accuracy questions to the experts. Here, I'll focus on a few issues I had with The Hurt Locker as a MOVIE - which is what it is after all (I mean, does anybody think Apocalypse Now was historically accurate?).<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />The movie really does build tension in a few key moments. Ironically, by not building any of the characters into the \\"star\\" or \\"point of view\\" character, there's a lot more suspense. We don't know if the guy attempting to defuse the bombs will succeed. The movie leverages this to great effect in some places.<br /><br />Just as important, the movie doesn't undermine the tension with a suffocating soundtrack. There actually isn't much of a soundtrack, so the silence really allows the tension to build. The lack of a suffocating soundtrack also reinforces every gust of wind and every click of the ammo cartridge.<br /><br />Along these lines, the movie does a great job emphasizing smaller moments. It certainly isn't just one gunfight after another, constant gunfire. Rather, there are moments when the most important thing is to clean the ammunition before it can be used. Each IED is treated as a very real and serious threat worthy of the film's attention.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />Except for the character several reviewers have called the maverick EOD, none of the characters stand out. All of the soldiers come across as relatively uninteresting, almost cookie-cutter stereotypes of a \\"grunt\\". The EOD perhaps goes to the other extreme of the maverick soldier who takes too many risks, but at least his character was more compelling to follow. He showed a genuine range of emotion and had a far more interesting relationship with the other troops. He has a multidimensional personality full of quirks. I found myself caring about him, but ignoring the rest of the troops.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the pseudo-documentary style of filming. It looks like it was filmed in 48 frames per second. But the movie isn't a documentary and the style just distracts at some points.<br /><br />Overall, 3.5 stars. It's probably the only noteworthy movie about the Iraq War thus far and worth watching for that alone.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore is a truly talented individual.  He has such a unique sound that you will not find anywhere else.  The Heist has songs that are fun to listen to for fun and songs that just make you want to cry.<br />Buy the whole album, it's worth it.
B0061S073A|5.0|Easy install, easy setup. Once configured properly machine will boot in Kids Place with only the apps you allow your child to access.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This movie could have been great. The opening scene made me want to know more about the origins of the alien people. In the end, however, I had more questions than answers. Furthermore, the actors were barely ok and their characters did not like one another with the exception of the anthropologist couple (who, in my opinion, did not fit together). There was a lot of dying going on and to be honest I did not care for any of those who did not make it until the end of the movie, or those who did for that matter. Very disappointing.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not quite finished with it, but have never been disappointed with John Grisham, and I have read most all of his books.
B0036K3OFY|5.0|This movie has one goal. To show you a bad a*$ killing some bad a$@ evil ninjas. In that goal it excels flawlessly. If your looking for a Brave Heart or Shaw Shank Redemption, you know not to look here. The main actor is a Korean Pop superstar and the main supporting actor was the lead star in the B film \\"AVP\\" (alien verses predator).<br /><br />If you want to see a super bloody violent movie, with some  bad ass ninjas then you will love this movie. When I went to see it at the theater I was looking for just that and I love it!
B008MM9630|4.0|So far I love this game. It has only forced close once, since I have reach level 4. I would recommend playing this game and its free. You might have to buy some diamonds, but itbis really inexpensive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So far so good.  Nice pick-up from season two.  I'm really starting to get engaged with the main characters.  Even though a couple got unexpected chomped on and two new members were added, it was a good shake-up.  Not yet sure how I feel about the separate storyline with the two females connecting with Meryl and the community of survivors, although nice to see mad man Meryl back.  It is an interesting take though; we'll have to see how it progresses.  Looking forward to seeing more of the chick with the sword in action.

B0010T0OCY|4.0|Fairly original concept concerning otherworld entities trying to comprehend and integrate the human psyche in order to expand their own intelligence.  Although, it is slightly derivative of both Star Trek: The Next Generation's Borg and the Cenabites from Hellraiser fame and their conquest of human souls.  Kiefer Sutherland is unconvincing as the deranged scientist.

1582406723|5.0|Review:<br /><br />I admit I am a late reader to The Walking Dead comics even though I know nearly everything that has taken place within them. When I saw that Netgalley had The Walking Dead Vol.1 up for review I seized the opportunity to see what the comics were all about. Let me tell you, my experience reliving the events in comic form was every bit as enjoyable as watching it on the show for the very first time. Since I am a huge fan of The Walking Dead I tend to get a little over enthusiastic when describing the series, so please bear with me.<br /><br />The Writing- The events in the comics unfold close to the show but with enough differences that it still leaves you curious which direction it is actually headed.<br /><br />The Characters- I loved seeing more of the character Glenn it was great seeing him treated like an invaluable member to the group rather than just a glorified gopher. The Shane/Lori relationship on the other hand fell flat for me. I didn't think Comic Shane deserved what happened and that whole event felt thrown in just for shock value. I wholeheartedly believe the relationship and how it evolves on the show is much more enjoyable. Speaking of Comic Lori her character almost managed to make me feel sympathetic to her situation upon Rick returning. I certainly don't feel that way towards her in the show so this was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The Zombies- Gory goodness at their best. I really have no complaints how the Zombies were introduced, drawn or behaved in the comics. Credit to both the artist and the writer.<br /><br />No Dixons- I wasn't going to mention this because I knew full well they weren't in the comics but actually reading the events that transpire in the comics without them made me sad. I won't go so far to say don't read the comics because of this after all the story was still good it just definitely was lacking a little something without them.<br /><br />Overall The Walking Dead Vol. 1 is as near perfection as one can expect from a comic. I love these characters nearly every bit as much as their on screen counterparts and can now see why people choose to read the comics in addition to watching the show. The comics for better and worse offer some really great insight to the characters that just can't be portrayed on screen. I highly recommend you pick this up and give it a shot. I will be rating The Walking Dead Vol. 1 Days Gone Bye ★★★★★.<br /><br />*I was provided a copy of this book to review through Netgalley.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I thought it was somewhat &#34;racey,&#34; but the writing was very repetative and predictable after a while, but I kept reading it to see what happened. To me, it did not seem to be a believeable story but I read it because all the girls at work read it and they were enthralled with it. Yes it had some sexy sex in it, but I think there've been better erotic books published prior to this one!

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (American)<br /><br />Let me start by saying this is a review of the American version after having read the book & seen the Swedish version. The storyline in the movies remains the same essentially with differences in casting, sets & closeness to the book. Some are small such as differences in closeness to the book some are larger as in sets & casting.<br /><br />The American version was correct to use Swedish settings but where they lag is in the cleanliness of the sets. This is a personal preference but I prefer the more natural gritty look & feel on the Swedish version. A notable point in the American version's favor is that it is slightly closer to the story as told in the book. The American wins by a nose here, a good example is at the end where the antagonist is dealt with. Neither the Swedish or English gets it correct & it changes your final view of both characters involved but the American is closer to the book here.<br /><br />The real difference is in casting, the Swedish version has it correct in both the case of Mikael Blomkvist & Erika Berger. They look older, like people that have had a long term relationship based on a slightly hedonistic sexual lifestyle. There's a little meat on them from their long years of late night work & odd hour meals plus their casual use of alcohol over the years. It fits the printed news industry. Mikael & Erika's relationship is not based on looks. It is based on their appetite & the fact that Mikael likes strong women that don't wait for a man to initiate sex. If his sexual relations had been based on looks then Lisbeth would never have had a chance with him. The American one is Hollywood American casting. They have a gym rat body as Mikael & a thin Erika which certainly doesn't fit her notable lifestyle. It seems that Hollywood would have us believe that only thin people have good sex & that doesn't fit reality at all. It's a common problem in movies from Tinsel Town. They polish the sets & polish the bodies if at all possible.<br /><br />The part that Rooney Mara took on was a courageous move on her part & she does well with it but that role was owned by Noomi Rapace as well as any role in cinema has ever been owned before. Still, the acting in the American version is very good so I'm really complaining of American tendencies in casting as versus the job done by casting in Sweden.<br /><br />I know that a lot of Americans dislike hearing a foreign language for an entire movie not to mention having to read subtitles & that would qualify as a personal preference. I believe those people are missing some of the world's best cinema & would urge them to view the Swedish version as I believe it is a better experience visually. It is certainly a more dynamic performance by Noomi as Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />I gave the American version 3.5 Amazon stars as opposed to 5 Amazon stars for the Swedish version for the above reasons. The American is surely worth seeing & is surprising, enjoyable & a wonderful mystery / social commentary on Sweden. The book is the best of the lot as it has the pages that detail the statistics on sexual assaults on women. The story after all is about Swedish societal & government lack of care about abuse of women in Sweden & not just Lisbeth Salander's life.<br /><br />The book title was more appropriate being MEN WHO HATE WOMEN, not as dramatic as TGWTDT perhaps, but the movie titles sort of muddle the storyline since they focus our attention on this one woman. I can see where people that only watch American language movies are, in my opinion, better off to watch the American one than skip it & would even say that those who watched the Swedish version only, should see Fincher's remake. I am firmly of the opinion that the Swedish is the best though.possible.

B000JMKNV0|4.0|have not finished reading the book but it is a page turner.  the strangeness of the story stimulates the readers curiosity with no hint of what comes next. society's lack of knowledge about the inner workings of mental institutions raises the mysterious nature of the story. the end is unpredictable unloess you have seen the movie with DiCaprio playing the hero/anti-hero.

1742200206|4.0|Lonely Planet has come a long way since their first title, \\"Across Asia on the Cheap,\\" which was was written and published in the mid 1970s by Tony and Maureen Wheeler. Over the years, their audience has slowly changed from budget-conscious backpackers to be geared to more affluent mainstream travelers, especially since BBC began their acquisition of Lonely Planet about five years ago. Last year, Lonely Planet started their new guidebook format, which has been extended to most of the current editions, including this one. Their presence on the Web is quite strong.<br /><br />For some, Lonely Planet's [[ASIN:1742200206 New York City (City Guide)]] will represent a radical and perhaps unwanted change from the early days. For others, including this reader, it's a better and easier to follow format, an example of a product that has analyzed the competition and made the changes to hold their position as the largest travel guide book publisher in the world, as they claim to be.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />+ Maps; plenty of them, all in color, and placed logically throughout the book<br />+ Large pull-out map in the back; folds out so that it doesn't have to be removed<br />+ Compact size; 5 x 0.9 x 7.8 inches, fits easily in a camera bag or day bag<br />+ Walking tours; short-term visitors will appreciate these<br />+ Restaurant suggestions; better than some of the sites on the 'Net<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />- Incomplete info; some of it is inaccurate<br /><br />New York City is a great place to visit, even if for just a few days or for repeat and long-term visitors. The authors have done a credible job of putting together a usable book that's perhaps best suited for the short-term visitor who is looking for a fast way to capture the highlights of this city and perhaps take a few walking tours during a visit. The 'Plan Your Trip' and 'Explore New York City' sections in the beginning will be useful for first-time visitors, as will the 'New York City's Top 16' chapter in the very beginning. The book offers color coded sections which will make it very easy for the visitor to access.<br /><br />The authors offer suggestions in many prices of where to eat, and most of these are good, and frequently better than many of the shill reviews that one finds on the 'Net today. But there were certain gaps that this part-time resident takes issue with. For example, on page 114 they list the famous Katz's Delicatessen, which was where one of the most memorable scenes from the 1989 film \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" was filmed. For lovers of pastrami on rye, it's worth a visit, but no mention at all is made of the 2nd Avenue Deli on East 33rd Street, which offers even better food and is a true favorite of many locals for years. The listing for the iconic Strand Book Store on page 154, the NYC book-lovers' treasure trove with it's \\"18 miles of books\\" has certain inaccuracies, and there are a few others like this in the book, but it's better to focus on what the book offers instead of what it lacks.<br /><br />This is a well organized 456-page guide, and it's a solid, worthy choice for the first-time visitor, and it has a decent index to help find everything from places to shop, sports & activities, places to eat and more, but there are other titles that should be added to the books that a frequent traveler or local resident may wish to consider. [[ASIN:111802740X Frommer's New York City 2012]] (or its newer version) might be a good addition to this Lonely Planet title for those who plan frequent visits, or for a local resident who wished to expand his or her horizons.<br /><br />New York City is a great place to visit in any season, and the [[ASIN:1742200206 New York City (City Guide)]] is a decent product for out of town visitors with a limited time to spend here. Among the books available here for those planning a trip to NYC, this is a good one if you get past some of the small inaccuracies found here, and that's what the phone or the 'Net is goodfor.  The upgraded Lonely Planet format is quite good, and this one is easily recommended for short-term visitors.<br /><br />11/9/2012for.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|True Grisham in the beginning - he paints a picture of the main character that causes you to admire him, sympathize with him and hope for the best possible outcome for him - and he delivers.  But along the way and in the second half of the book you are jolted by the introduction of new characters that first you like, then you don't, then you feel sorry for them and you begin to doubt the protaganist's motives and character.  Very readable but perhaps more confusion than is plausible.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|There is something special about Wes Anderson films, and Fantastic Mr. Fox definitely has it. Anderson makes fun of human (or animal!) frailties, but leaves us feeling good about ourselves and the world.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What can I say...sometimes it feels like the author did not know how to finish the series, but that does not mean that you will be seduced by Christian Gray any less. That character is the one that makes the whole series worth reading.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I have no idea what was so great about this movie.  The dance scenes got boring and there was absolutely no storyline.  The only bright spot was Matthew McConaughey's performance and given his other performances, this one was not his best.

B007REV4T8|4.0|First, this will not contain spoilers.<br /><br />I decided to go into Skyfall with very little information about the film.  I read very little and stayed away from any sneak peeks unlike the last two films in which I had advanced knowledge of the plot and certain elements.  This way I was able to get a feel of the film on it's own merits as I experienced it vs reconciling it against any preconceived notions.<br /><br />For those who want a short review I found Skyfall to be a good film.  It blends traditional elements with a non-traditional flow.  It's really unlike the majority of the formulaic Bonds and will stand out in the franchise.  The film it shares the most similarities, in my opinion, is Dr. No.  A fitting resemblance considering the 50th Anniversary of that very film.<br /><br />The overall feel of Skyfall is far more modern but matches the pacing and formula of Dr. No.  No always stands out against the franchise as one of the more different films obviously because it was the first and the producers had not found their stride.  Skyfall fits into that mold, bucking the previous trends in the series.  Yes it has it's traditional moments, and I suspect that many fans will be happy that their demands for certain elements previously omitted from Casino and Quantum have been reinserted to the reboot.  These elements will help fans re-introduce themselves to the Bond of old but the very non-traditional pacing of the film will most likely generate a divided response from fans.  I fully expect this film to be received well critically but many traditional fans will dislike it perhaps even more than Quantum of Solace.  I won't hail Skyfall as the best Bond film but it certainly will fit well in the collection and I will be glad to snap up the DVD when it releases later next year.<br /><br />Skyfall is yet another addition to the reboot of Bond and many will find it breaks with some convention.  Unlike Quantum it does not really continue any specific storyline.  Instead it harkens back to the older Bonds where the new villains were stand alone characters but you could certain infer that they were a member of SPECTER or in this case Quantum.  Like Mr. White and Mr. Green in the previous two films, Skyfall features yet another color, Mr. Silver.  Quantum is never named in Skyfall but it is very easy to infer that it's there.  Javier Bardem is perhaps the jewel of this film.  His performance is amazing and his scenes are easily the best in the movie.  His appearance is clearly drawn from Christopher Walken's Max Zorin with the mental derangement really ramped up.  I thoroughly enjoyed Bardem and think he is one of the better villians created in Bond Universe and it's a crime that he ended up with so little screen time.  Much like Dr. No, Silver is largely an offscreen character.  Regardless the film still rewards you as it carries on.<br /><br />The action scenes were well shot and there is some very impressive stunt work at play here.  I was pleased for the most part with the physical stunt work.  There was still elements of CGI but not as heavy as some of the earlier films.  The pacing was a bit different than previous Bonds and it worked for me.  I liked the change ups Mendes threw this time.  The climactic 30 minutes is really unlike any Bond movie ever made before and ironically has more in common with an episode of the A-Team or a certain McCauley Culkin series but in the end it's entertaining.<br /><br />My biggest gripes really fall to the story and plot.  There are really two stories going on in the film.  The primary plot line is a confusing affair.  For much of the film you, as is Bond, are pretty much in the dark about what is going on and then abruptly the plot motivation is crammed down your throat with virtually no follow up.  A lot of viewers in the theater around me were very confused about what was really going on and it was clear Mendes was really leaving a lot up to the audience to piece together or just flatout infer/make up in their own minds.  The second storyline is a substory revolving around Bond/M and his past yet again.  Much like the previous Craig Bond's a lot of little hints are made and it's clear something was going on but they never actually come out with any explanations.  The final act of the film is likewise very ambiguous in this area for reasons I won't get into.  Basically the substory really never gets resolved in any satisfying way and it feels as though Mendes wanted to tease you but leave it up to you to fill the story out yourself.  Not sure how I truly feel about that approach.  The main storyline ends up being a little thin and as such it's clear that the films merits lay in the journey here and not the actual substance.  Again this reminds me of Dr. No in that the journey was more rewarding than the actual story.<br /><br />In the end Skyfall is a successful modern action film on it's own and a worthy addition to the Bond franchise.  It caps off the ambitious Bond reboot trilogy and it closes out an era well.  It will be long debated where Skyfall falls into the series relevance and I am sure it will not be fancied by many but if you are a Bond fan it will entertain you and it will most likely end up in your film collection.
0385535147|1.0|I'm recovering from hip and wrist surgery and wanted a quick read that would hold my attention.  Grisham has had some wonderful books that fit this genre and I hoped this might be one of them.  NOT.  With some work, would probably make a good short story, but paying full price for this off the cuff, predictable \\"novel\\" did nothing to help my recuperation!
B004WJRF6C|1.0|This sounds like it was recorded by a self-indulgent musician in his basement... oh, it was.  Apart from the superb \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", which is still a staple of McCartney's thrilling concerts, and \\"That Would Be Something\\", there is nothing here of substance or interest.

0345803485|1.0|I really don't get the appeal of this book - if you are in to submission/dominance there are loads of this on the market but I don't understand why this is in any way above the rest.  I didn't buy the book I am happpy to say. I would not contribute in cash for this to the author or publishers - it's far too 'so what?' but the rest of you suckers that did - well hey you have only yourselves to blame for wasting your money and joining the media wagon. I must confess however, that I didn't read it all - I really didn't realise it was just another submission novel - once I did - it hit the decks.  Completely ordinary rubbish and really really don't get the media hype.

B0094U0RJQ|4.0|I have only listened to Tempest all the way through about three times, and each time I like it more and expect that to continue, so maybe I'll come back later and add that fifth star. I love the rootsy riffs that are very tastefully laid down on which Dylan embroiders his intricate pattern of words. I never cease to be amazed at the way he has with words, phrases, ideas - the way they come together so that the total is much greater than the sum of its parts. I'm reminded of the reference to him by Joan Baez in \\"Diamonds and Rust,\\" saying, \\"You who are so good with words, and with keeping things vague...\\"<br /><br />I love the sound of his weary old voice, like the way I would expect a voice to sound if you climbed up to a mountain cave to ask a hermit the meaning of life. I just wish I could understand more of what he's saying. I expect that to come as I listen more, hence the additional star I expect to come back here and score. So far my favorite tracks are the last three. \\"Tin Angel\\" is especially spooky and evocative, but again the favorites may change as I get into it more.<br /><br />By the way, I had some trouble downloading the MP3 album. Somehow the last few tracks got lost in moving it to my iTunes. It's probably something I did wrong, but it was frustrating. They're in the cloud player, so I was able to bring them into my iMac at the office and burn a CD, so I've got it all now.<br /><br />Roll on Bob.
B005PK553C|5.0|I really loved this show. The plot is unique compared to most shows I've seen that are about ghosts/the supernatural. It's a great story and I can't wait to see Season 2.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|this is a brilliant film the 3d is awsome I would highly reccommend this if you want a good night in with your friends the extra dvds are great as you can watch the film then go and watch how it was made, get to know the cast and how  the special effects are made, what I also like about this film is that you can have an alternative ending what more can be said you can watch this over and over again and enjoy it every time :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thought Grisham had lost his touch -- but this surprised me.  He is again master of the craft -- stretching you to actually buy into it, despite the improbability of it all. Glorious twists and turns throughout.  A very good read.  Put it on the top of your list. One of his best in a long time.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Once again rovio only comes out with an HD version costing 2.99 while other devices can get a free version. Also if you want another world (it only comes with two) you have to pay an additional 1.99.

B009DH379C|5.0|This is a commanding Queen performance. The footage really captures each band member's enormous contribution to this epic concert. Freddie is in awesome form - his voice, his showmanship, his costume changes, his rapport with the audience, his bit with the flags - just all around undeniably incredible. Brian shines as usual with his tremendously talented playing and energized performance. Roger plays the drums with his intense immediacy and tenacity, thus earning the privilege of (almost) wearing Freddie's crown at the end. John's fierce performance and captivating bass lines add a complete exclamation point to the show. The personal moments with each band member throughout the performance are quite enchanting. The editing and vivid color and lighting of the footage is completely spectacular and does the concert total justice. This is indeed a very special capture of what makes Queen such an amazing, legendary band. Love it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|\\"The Racketeer\\" is another triumpth for one of my favorite authors. Grisham has a way of building characters and holding our interest in a way that is unusual and very entertaining. He is a story-teller extraordinaire, and I won't ruin this great book by talking about specifics. His works vary from marvelous mystery to gut-wrenching laughter, especially when he writes about Ford County, Mississippi. His grasp of legal matters is unsurpassed, having been a successful attorney, but his sense of humor regarding the \\"good ole boys\\" in the South is priceless.

0385535147|4.0|This reviews the Audible.com, audio version of The Racketeer:<br /><br />For those of you who think he never left, let me refer you to \\"The Litigators,\\" which I am sure was ghost written with or by someone else. But this \\"The Racketeer\\" is great.<br /><br />It's great within the genre. It is pure entertainment -- a page turner, the kind of plot you want to believe but almost cannot. By the midpoint, if you haven't figured out the keystone to the whole thing, it's okay, because the unfolding is great fun. Even if you did figure it out, it is fun watching the details fall into place. The pace of the revelations is careful and effective.<br /><br />If I have one criticism, it's Bannister's dealings with Nathan. There is something unnecessary there, and I find the disturbance-level to be a little bit outside the genre. There is an underlying beat of \\"revenge\\" in this story, but really there is no revenge and there is certainly no revenge to be had by Bannister on Nathan. Maybe JG was showing the consequences of a corrupt system -- good guy gets punished and bad boy walks? I don't know. Still, the violence and flip but horrendous treatment of the guy is a tad overboard. I expected a justification for Bannister's treatment of him, but none was there.<br /><br />Except for those portions, the book is a romp -- a smug, high-stakes caper replete with shady characters and likeable bad guys and a pinch of environmentalism added to its appeal. It sort of feels like a 1980s episode of Miami Vice. Cars, boats, and private planes.<br /><br />The narrator nailed the attitude of the main character/narrator. At first, I thought it was going too slow, as others have mentioned, but in time, I fell into the cadence of the reader and found his voice pleasant and appropriate. He attempted no stupid female intonations, and that was a good thing.<br /><br />There are some odd things that don't quite line up for me in the plot. I found Bannister's meeting Vanessa in the prison visiting room a little unlikely. When they get together the first night, they act like long-time lovers. I also find the FBI's stupidity a little too clich&eacute; and convenient. The original deal struck between them and Bannister seemed too sweet, too quick and very unlikely, though I may be wrong and these things may really go that way.<br /><br />The ensemble of characters is interesting but very much kept in the background of Bannister. Of course the woman is gorgeous, but they and some other background people who help facilitate the ordeal are nearly nameless and very forgettable.<br /><br />I guess the takeaways here would be -- trust no one and Robin Hood was not a crook.<br /><br />There is an old Hawaii 5-0 episode where the bad guys hide similar contraband in huge tuna (circa 1968). they move the stuff in the fish.  Made me think about this book.a little unlikely. When they get together the first night, they act like long-time lovers. I also find the FBI's stupidity a little too cliché and convenient.

B0089J29C6|5.0|For movie buffs, historians, teachers or plain film lovers, How To Marry A Millionaire on Blu-Ray is imperative, as part of any serious collection. It is a welcome release, which gives us all an opportunity to analyse and study earlier scope cinematography. I myself wrote an article about this for the Webinsider site. While not an expert, it is relatively easy to put this picture into historical perspective and importance.<br /><br />The film itself is quite pleasant, by the way, a light comedy with hints of social critic. It opens with a delightful orchestral overture, a demo for stereo sounds behind the CinemaScope screen. It is also a reminder why we were involved in this hobby in the first place.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
082300659X|4.0|The drawings reproduced here are impeccably rendered in the academic tradition.  I suppose most of them are works by students of the author, and, gorgeous as they are, it seems as if all of them could have been done by the same artist.  No variance in style, which contributed to the downfall of the neoclassic tradition in the first place, which led to the ridiculous dominance of impressionistic art which haunts bookstore shelves to this day.  The odd size of the book, somewhere between octavo and quarto, hurts the appreciation of the drawings, as some illustrations nearly require a magnifying glass to explore them. I for one would love to see a folio sized book of these and similar drawings.  As far as the text goes, Aristides covered most of it in her earlier book, Classical Atelier Drawing.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham will probably never get the Nobel prize in literature, but he knows better than most other paperback heroes how to write stories that you want to read to the end. This particular book is not his greatest, but certainly among the better half. Yes I have read most of his books... The story is about revenge.
B007EECSFA|3.0|SPOILERS<br /><br /> I am torn when it comes to reviewing this book; on one hand, Kate Morton is an amazing writer; she can evoke images and feelings with beautiful accuracy-she can tap into everything from what a happy chubby baby feels like to be plopped on the ground, to what a teen girl feels about her first love-and not just emotionally, but physically, everything-the same goes for an older woman looking back on her life-and looks.  She can re-create an Australian creekside, to bombed out 1941 London to 2011-As a nurse, though, her portrayal of clueless obnoxious nurses was a bit much-I can assure you, we're a much more sensitive lot than that, and not as clueless either. But overall, I find her writing abilities near magical.<br /><br />  BUT! and it is a big \\"but;\\" Ms. Morton seems to not expect a great deal intellectually from her readers; my kindle was at 31% when I had the plot completely figured out-except for the fate of one character, and that was a happy surprise, I must admit.  But otherwise, I found the clues down-right heavy-handed, from character descriptions and descriptions about appearance that begged you to see the obvious, but the biggest clue, and why I was able to get it so quickly was the determined and almost too frequent mention of eye-color (ta-da!)-through-out the entire book, clues were pounding you over the head to be noticed, and it frankly ruined the book for me.  I will probably try to read another Kate Morton book, but if it is the same heavy-handedness as this one, then I will give up.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Within the past several years, we have developed the technology to create REAL diamonds - compressed heated carbon... (not CZ's), and REAL emeralds, and REAL rubies, and REAL sapphires.  These stones are made, perfectly and flawlessly, in the laboratory.  They are NOT fakes... they are the exact same thing that is mined out of the earth... down to the last molecule.  The only differences between laboratory-created precious gemstones and their earth-mined counterparts, is that the laboratory-created ones are FLAWLESS and they cost less than 5% of what the earth-mined ones cost.<br />WHY would anyone continue to purchase earth-mined, flawed, occluded, outrageously expensive diamonds and gemstones?  It makes no sense at all.  We are funding horrific crimes against our fellow man:  murders, mutilations, torture, rape, dismemberment... all needlessly.<br />And the so called &#34;certified conflict-free&#34; gemstones have been proven time and again to NOT be conflict-free.  That's a lie.  Why pay 20 times as much, for a lesser product, which hurts people... when you can pay 5% or less (often much less than that), for a superior product, which promotes the economy and hurts nobody?  This is a no-brainer.  This movie is a good introduction for those who are unaware of the atrocity of diamond mining in Africa.

1881273156|5.0|This book is an all-time best-selling classic in the field of relationship counseling. The interesting thing however, is that if couples would read this book early-on in their relationship... even before getting married (as my wife and I did)... there might not be so much need for relationship counselors in the first place. The tragic mistake that so many people make, as outlined in this book, is that they try to express love for their mate in a way that is exactly how they would want love expressed to them. The intent is good there, it is after all an attempt to &#34;do unto others as you would have done unto you&#34;. The problem lies not with the intent, but with the execution. For example, if a man appreciates &#34;words of affirmation&#34; from his wife (having his wife say every day that she loves or admires him)... and he reciprocates by offering his wife similar &#34;words of affirmations&#34; ... that may not be the particular &#34;Love Language&#34; that his wife appreciates. She might, for example, more appreciate &#34;Quality Time&#34; (spending time talking with her), or &#34;Acts of Service&#34; (getting that chore list done for here) much more-so that just words. Or... vice-versa... it varies according to the emotional makeup of each individual. The main message here is that in a loving relationship, it is not enough to do unto others as you would have done unto you... one must go beyond that to do unto others as they would prefer that you do unto them... and that requires more understanding and work that just &#34;being nice&#34;.<br />Although this example is not given in the book, I think the best example of this dynamic is a story a pastor once told me about a 75-year old man and woman who had been married for 50 years. Every morning the man lovingly cut off the END piece of a fresh loaf of bread and gave it to his wife, while he took an INTERIOR piece of the bread loaf for himself. After 50 years, the wife could no longer contain her secret resentment, and she yelled &#34;Why do you always give me that crusty END piece, and take a nice soft inside piece for yourself!?&#34; The old man paused a moment, and as tears welled up in his eyes, he said to his wife, &#34;Dear, the end piece is my favorite part. I have been giving the end piece to you all these years because I thought surely it must also be your favorite part.&#34; How very sad. The man had been sacrificing needlessly, out of love, when if the couple had just had better communication, they could have EACH been enjoying their respective favorite parts of the bread loaf, with no need for such sacrifice. Even more sad... all those years of needless resentment festering within the wife, who thought her husband was being selfish, when he was actually being self-sacrificing.<br />The moral of this story: discover what your mate's &#34;love languages&#34; are, and love them how they want to be loved... not how you assume they want to be loved, just because that's how you want to be loved. And as a real though-provoking side-note: if you are not married yet... try to find a mate whose &#34;love languages&#34; are basically the SAME as yours... and then, you can just do what comes naturally, without having to worry about such things very much. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a lasting and loving relationship with their spouse.tment, and she yelled &#34;Why do you always give me that crusty END piece, and take a nice soft inside piece for yourself!?&#34; The old man paused a moment, and as tears welled up in his eyes, he said to his wife, &#34;Dear, the end piece is my favorite part.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I am the type of person who takes weeks or months to read a boom. This one I was done with in 3 days! It was beautiful. Easy to read I could see how someone could get tired of the back and forth but I was dying to know how it would end. Characters were easy to identify with and easy to see it play out in your mind. Definite recommend for a quick love story

B005ZOBZI2|5.0|le Carre books transcend genre, literature that happens to usually be about the intelligence community. le Carre heroes are Quixotic for some kind of redemption, be it love or a cause or both, the life better lived. \\"Single & Single,\\" \\"The Little Drummer Girl,\\" \\"The Russia House,\\" \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" the supporting characters of the Smiley novels come to mind as examples of the classic le Carre heroes. \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" falls into classic le Carre canon, turning its lens to the war on terror. In le Carre's world, the enemy isn't just the antagonist but among so-called allies and colleagues, the dogmatic and myopic, the small-minded, smug, and incurious gate keepers with hidden agendas. The heroes, outsiders of some kind, inquisitive, data-driven, doggedly willing to peel back the onion for an elusive truth that is more liable to crush them than set them free. If you have or have not read a le Carre novel, this is a fine example of one.  This is a review of the audio book, so specific to the narrator, he's a fine voice actor in tone and accent who helped enormously in bringing the characters to life.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|A clever lawyer exploits an opportunity to get out of jail, legally, and also get rich via a convoluted scheme. The problem is that it's too clever by half and the reader isn't going to swallow most of it.<br /><br />Because Malcolm Bannister is a pretty dull and unlikable hero, there has to be some macguffin to keep the reader engaged. In this case, it's an odd amount of small but heavy gold minibars, unmarked and untraceable. Why would anyone mint something like that, without serial numbers or markers? But ok, let's play along.<br /><br />One of the characters gets bribed with them (why not something a lot more convenient like cash?). Inexplicably, he hangs on to these and lives a fairly humble lifestyle that would probably be supported just fine by his 6-figure salary.<br /><br />Then a former hillbilly meth dealer somehow gets a hold of them and apparently only buys a big TV and a rundown bar before burying his fortune. Seriously? A convict gets out, murders for the gold, then decides he wants to work for a living rather than cash in and live like a king?<br /><br />Finally Malcolm gets his paws on them. I won't even try to explain the scheme he hatches, but basically he invests tens of thousands of dollars, and creates a fake company, flies out of the country, acquires drugs and fake passports... just to get the hillbilly out of his shack for a few days and find the gold. Bear in mind he has only some convict's word that it exists. I guess he'd feel awkward just tying the guy up and and pointing a gun at him.<br /><br />Is it a spoiler to tell you that once he's got the gold... nothing else happens and everything goes smoothly?<br /><br />At no point do you feel like the hero is in danger of getting hurt, sent back to prison, or losing his fortune. There are plenty of opportunities for suspense (his partners could betray him, he gets stopped at the airport, his girlfriend screws up or crosses him, a car gets pulled over with a trunkful of gold, the hillbilly figures out he's been duped) but Grisham takes a pass on all of them.<br /><br />Our hero flies into the sunset, free of all legal trouble, and goes to live on a tropical island. The island itself is described in the most cliched way possible, beautiful walks on the beach, and somehow this is more disappointing than the Rube Goldberg plotline. John has the opportunity to showcase his writing talent here, but leaves out any details that would add an air of realism to the setting.<br /><br />This yarn's a yawner.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|I had not read this book before, but my grandson selected it to read for his essay assignment and wanted to discuss the book with me. It's clear why this book has become a classic. In one sense it breaks all the rules of writing and sets itself apart. The author has been true to his own vision and shows the reader the fluidity of the mind of a person who has endured shellshock and has post traumatic stress disorder -- the moving in and out of time in what appear to be alternately flashbacks (the war) and hallucinations (abduction by aliens). It further addresses the horror of the Allied bombing of Dresden, Germany, in World War II -- to our shame. I told my grandson to imagine that someone had just knocked on the door and ordered him to go to war. How would he feel? That's the point of view of this book. A young man is conscripted and sent to war. What does he fear? How does he view the daily life of war? Because Kurt Vonnegut was himself a prisoner in the slaughterhouse converted into a prison, his writing is that more realistic about what he witnessed in Dresden through the eyes of his protagonist. Because of the slipping in and out of time, it can be a bit confusing, especially for a young reader, but one adapts to share this amazing journey of memories and discoveries.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|While it was interesting to see a movie that set the stage for the original Alien movie, it's not like this film adds anything to that film (which is much much better).  While I'm generally a fan of science-fiction movies, and even have an appreciation for 2nd rate sci-fi films, as the film continued it seemed dull to me.  Once the 'aliens' take over the film in the second half, there's really not much question about what's going to happen.
B00A48ECL6|5.0|As much as this incarnation of Sherlock is learning from his Dr. Watson, she, likewise, is learning from him.  In this episode, her mind seems a bit sharper and more engaged in Sherlock's investigation.  In addition, we learn more about this Sherlock's personal life and the lack of connection with his only living parent.  While Watson tracks this down and, later, challenges him to connect with her on a personal level, Sherlock is following the smallest of clues to determine why a plane crash happened and who murdered one of the occupants.<br /><br />I have read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's complete works of Sherlock Holmes and seen most of the BBC rendered Sherlock Holmes series.  I think he would be pleased at the lack of orthodoxy in this adaption and, perhaps, even pleased that his character could be stretched wide and far into the next millenia.  I am particularly pleased at the introduction of Watson as female and the emotions this elicits from Sherlock's character.  Also, a shout out to Aidan Quinn as the mature, trusting and guiding force to Sherlock's schemes.<br /><br />Maybe this won't be as lasting as the original stories but, then, neither is Shakespeare staged as though written in the 20th Century.  Either way, it is a good ride, compelling, and worth a watch.
0399157565|5.0|I devour the new Scarpetta novels every time one is published.  The Bone Bed is just plain terrific.  My only complaint is that the book ended rather abruptly, with a killer whose identity I had no opportunity to figure out, but that is not Cornwell's style.  The real problem with the ending is probably that I was enjoying the book so much I simply didn't want it to end.  An excellent writer.

B00979CS50|4.0|One of the reasons I liked Americana so much was the pleasure of hearing a new Neil Young album with good lyrics, regardless of who wrote them. It's the first time in way too long.<br /><br />What a pity that Psychedelic Pill is mostly back to the flat, overliteral self-mythologising that now dominates his songwriting. \\"Driftin Back\\" is the worst: lines like \\"then the big tech giant came along\\" and \\"I might be a pagan\\" aren't charmingly goofy, they're childishly bad. He needs to start editing this stuff, not just 'trusting the muse'.<br /><br />\\"Ramada Inn\\" is much better, though it's very simple: it could do with more of the novelistic detail he brought to Greendale songs like \\"Carmichael\\" and \\"Bandit\\". But there's no denying the emotional kick of the last verse and chorus. These everyday life story songs have become a good style for Neil in his late career.<br /><br />Of course the thrill of Psychedelic Pill is the music - Neil giving the horse a run in the long paddock. Their loping groove is a pleasure to listen to. Some of these songs are indulgently long: this is Neil's 'Coltrane' album, though Frank, Billy & Ralph are certainly no McCoy, Jimmy & Elvin.<br /><br />There's some great melodies. The chord structures are simple but gorgeous in \\"Ramada Inn\\" and the classic \\"Walk Like a Giant\\". The short country-rock numbers \\"Born in Ontario\\" and \\"Twisted Road\\" are a treat too.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Its not my favorite king story but it was still fun to read I kinds wish there was little more to the story. I do like the fact that the kids out shined the adults in the situation the story was well done. Worth every penny spent on it.
1451638450|5.0|It has been observed that most human males die before reaching maturity.<br /><br />Lord Ivan Xav Vorpatril has nearly managed that several times in his short life. The earliest such occasion occurred about an hour before he was born, during an attempt on the throne of Barrayar in which his mother and father were caught by forces loyal to the pretender. His father died while friends tried to rescue them; his mother managed to escape with them and give birth to Ivan while in hiding afterwards.<br /><br />So, given that early pre-natal conditioning as it were, Ivan has spent most of his life trying to avoid politics or attracting too much attention to himself while attempting to live a comfortable life. Not an easy task for someone potentially in line for the throne, and made even less easy by his manic cousin Miles Vorkosigan, who has an absolute genius for attracting chaos in his wake - and dragging Ivan into it. And it doesn't help that Ivan's determination to avoid living up to all of his potential too visibly is made all the more conspicuous by contrast with the friends and family around him.<br /><br />By age 34, Ivan has managed to work himself into a fairly comfortable position: a taste for good food and drink, comfortable lodgings, and a job as Captain and aide to a high ranking admiral in the Barrayarran armed forces where he serves ably. A certain amount of status, a job challenging enough to be interesting without the headaches of high rank, enough leisure and status to attract a fair number of bedmates on a regular basis, and distance from his mother, who is still waiting for Ivan to get on with his life. True, most of Ivan's old girlfiends seem to have all gotten married. Even his cousin Miles has managed to settle down and start raising a family. And things don't seem to be quite as much fun as they were when he was younger...<br /><br />Nonetheless, despite his efforts to keep a low profile, avoid politics, and romantic commitment, Ivan can't help himself when his sensibilities override his normal caution. He's proved himself able to act swiftly and intelligently when circumstances force it on him, and his proven loyalty to the Emperor (and family connections) have of late earned him some respect - and attention - in his own right. So it's not entirely unexpected that an otherwise routine assignment would be interrupted by a undercover agent of Imperial Security in a tight spot calling on him without warning for help.<br /><br />Nothing too dangerous, nothing too arduous - Byerly Vorrutyer just wants him to see if he can make the acquaintance of a young woman and find out why the dangerous people the agent is trying to corral are so interested in her. Ivan reluctantly agrees. (It doesn't hurt that she's beautiful after all.)<br /><br />Boy meets girl; girl rebuffs boy; boy persists; girl's unexpected female companion stuns boy and the two of them drag him into their apartment and tie him up while they figure out what to do next. It seems Ivan's target is on the run from a rather nasty power struggle, doesn't know if the others in her family have survived, and is about out of options. Tej and her exotic companion Rish are refugees from Jackson's Whole and figure Ivan is an assassin. Ivan manages to convince them of his bona fides by frustrating an attempt to kidnap the two women - while still tied to the chair!<br /><br />And after that, it begins to get really interesting. Ancient secrets, complex familial relationships, deadly adventures, sheer comedy, pathos, romance, Imperial crogglement - Bujold has crafted another richly satisfying tale.<br /><br />Ivan Vorpatril has been in the Vorkosigan saga as long as Miles. He's grown from being a comedic foil and butt of jokes to an interesting character in his own right. (A running gag in the series has been his constant disparagement as \\"Ivan-You-Idiot\\". This time around a character is impressed enough to comment \\"Your mother told me she didn't think you could be anidiot.\\") This novel is Ivan's first full story, and continues the growth that began in [[ASIN:067187845X Memory (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)]] and flowered in [[ASIN:0671578855 A Civil Campaign]] to a satisfying fulfillment.<br /><br />Along the way, we also get some wonderful glimpses of how Miles and his wife Ekaterin are getting along, not to mention Duv Galeni and Delia. And what happens to Imp Sec is worth the price of admission all by itself.

The update is free, but its hard to wait. The tap attacks are awesome. Luke (the tiny red bird) can use a lightsaber and destroy anything. Ben (the bomb bird) can use the force. Han (the yellow bird) can shoot three times and bounce of metal. Chewie ( the big red bird) can do the exact same thing as the normal bird. A rebel pilot ( tiny blue bird) can triple it's self. Leia ( the new pink bird) I think can pull metal. Wait for the update. After though get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B008RTE09S|5.0|I just picked this up at Best Buy.  At first I thought the $26.00 price tag was a little steep for a film with a running time of less than one hour but the video and audio quality are absolutely amazing.  This film benefits from some great bonus HD features, many of the video numbers being extended and tiny bits of additional footage being added.  Unless you count the remix on the \\"LOVE\\" album, this marks the very first time \\"I Am The Walrus\\" is seen and heard in full stereo and in glorious HD which makes the entire package worth the money.  Most Beatles fans are aware that the second half of the album version of that song is in fake stereo.  Some shots, such as the General who talks gibberish, sections of the \\"Spaghetti\\" scene, \\"Bluejay Way\\" and certain other random shots are quite grainy, which is understandable given the 45 year age of the film, but overall it was remastered incredibly well.  The colors are vivid and the picture looks like it was filmed recently.  The songs sound bright and crisp, as does the dialogue.  One scene that sticks out in particular is \\"Fool On The Hill.\\"  In closeups, when Paul is twitching his face, you can see the moistness of his eyeballs, their bright color, their reflection off the camera and every blood vessel.  Great care was taken to make this bluray look stunning.  Definitely worth it for a Beatles fan.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I think this is a poorly written book with a weak storyline.  I was expecting an exciting story of sex, love etc.  I was very disappointed.  The sex scenes made me cringe.  I don't get the hype about this triology.  I made it 80% through the first book hoping to get to the part that made it such a great book. I gave up and wish I hadn't wasted my time.  I have friends who feel the same way.  Read something else. Wish E.L James would refund my money.
0345803493|5.0|The second book of this series didn't disappoint!  Still HOT, HOT, HOT but showing the growth of both charecters & their love.  If you're a prude--don't bother w/ this series!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|In my humble opinion, John's finest.  I felt as if we had agreed to take a trip together, and  he was the driver, and I thought I knew where we were headed, but just when I thought we had arrived, he makes another turn off the main road!  So suspenseful, I could not put this book down, and when I HAD to, I was constantly thinking about the characters. What a wonderful gift we have been given to share these wonderful books by John.  Not a dull page in the whole book.  Have read it twice, have read all of John's books, and look forward to more.  Keep 'em comin'

B0085RQLXK|2.0|Once upon a time there was a kick ass band from Boston named Aerosmith, but sad to say that band no longer exists. I so wanted to love this cd as many other fans did. As you can see by the reviews, this is not a solid effort put forth by the band. So many songs just go nowhere with repeat choruses going on and on and on. I truly found it difficult to get through even my first play of this cd. There are NO classic songs. Sure there are a few decent tracks, it's not all garbage, but after 11 years this cd should have been spectacular. If Tyler went on the Voice to audition these tunes he probably wouldn't even make the cut!  There are 15 tracks, I would say 3 solid songs and the rest just filler. Many folks are saying they don't like the ballads...to me they aren't what brings this rating down. This cd gets only a two star rating because the quality of songs just isn't good.

B008OOYALE|3.0|Got the app to help get points on bakery story, now I'm hooked. However, I am really disappointed by the gold situation. I have received gifted gold from friends, but it does not show up as available. I tried to purchase gold, once again did not reflect in game. I contacted teamlava and they have not fixed the problem or refunded my money. I have tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling, but to no use. Team lava needs to fix this aspect of the game, especially since you need gold to do just about everything. Ugh!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Everyone should read this book. This book holds the key to information that we all can use to tap into the energy that is in the universe. It's the kind of book that you need to own and keep close by to remind yourself of how important our thoughts are on a daily basis. I would highly recommend it to everyone.

0439023513|4.0|I have the Kindle edition.<br /><br />I am the kind of person who will read the end of a book because I just can't stand it, so I read the reviews for this book before I had even read Catching Fire.  I just had to know about Katniss, Peeta and Gale.  What I read didn't keep me from reading the two sequels.<br /><br />****** I try to be vague in the section below and if you've read book 2, then it probably won't be a spoiler at all.******<br /><br />I suppose I had lowered my expectation based on some of the reviews but I was pleasantly surprised when I read the book.  I found Katniss' reactions and actions to be understandable.  She was not some superhero without emotions or without failings.  I love Peeta in the books and was sad that he wasn't more of a physical presence in the first part of the book.  However, even though he wasn't there physically, he was there in Katniss' mind, which meant a lot of thought and soul-searching on her part.<br /><br />There was a lot of talk about fairy tales and people wanting a fairy tale ending and others wanting a more \\"realistic\\" ending.  To me, I found the ending satisfying and I'm a fairy tale ending kind of person.  (I get enough real life tragedy to want to have it hit me in the face all the time in books that I read.)  Does everything end rosy?  No.  Do Katniss, Peeta and Gale end the story free of traumatic scars and memories?  Of course not, and that's where it makes the ending \\"believable.\\"  Does love win out? Read it and see, but I think you'll find the ending in a sunset...
B002SZAU1Y|5.0|This is the one book to make me cry in the first few pages. I love the story of the devoted husband who helps make life easy for his wife after his death by sending her letters each month for the first year of her life as a widow.

B000SEGUDE|3.0|Interesting book, says much about our paths in society and where we could be heading; but jumps back and forth in time, creating a combo of classics and high school reading lists in one book.

0316228532|3.0|It was an interesting peek into the lives of Pagfordians.<br /><br />The characters are complex and cynical and pretty amusing sometimes.<br /><br />Overall i thought it was a pleasurable read, though it does become a little sad in parts.<br /><br />I would recommend it. Besides, who could avoid a JK Rowling novel ??
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Moneyball is a great baseball movie that really isn't about baseball, sure it serves as the backdrop but it's more about Brat Pitt's character Billy Beane and what he had to do to stay competitive in the new era of huge-salary baseball. Based around the book by the same name, it follows Pitt and Jonah Hill (General Manager and Assistant General Manager, respectively) as they try to build a championship baseball team (the Oakland A's) with a payroll that is a fraction of what other big ball clubs are spending.<br /><br />The biggest appeal of this film is the way Pitt and Hill interact. You believe the character's relationship as it goes from employer/employee to mentor/student to friends. It's not a buddy flick, but the two work well off each other, have some humorous moments and some deep conversations about life, risk, and their motives. They are likeable throughout and you begin to root for them without even realizing it, you want them to succeed. Both were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances.<br /><br />Without going into the plot too much, it's interesting to watch the film and see how Pitt sticks to his guns despite massive initial scrutiny from his players, his head coach, and the media. Even Hill begins to question the path they are taking, but Pitt never wavers. Refusing to follow traditional baseball standards is what gets him in hot water...until he starts winning. This is when the film really takes off. The A's manage to start winning with a team of nobodies despite all reasonable expectations of what they would be able to accomplish.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is the pacing and the sometimes muddled screenplay. I for one don't have a problem with the pacing of the film, but can see how some would think it a bit slow especially in the beginning. Also, like most things written by Aaron Sorkin, you are left occasionally saying \\"Wait...what did they just say?\\" Sometimes the dialog is hard to follow,most notably for me when Pitt is trading players in his office on the phone with other GM's. It's a scene where you know what just happened, but aren't sure how you got there.<br /><br />All in all though, except for very minor gripes, this is a fantastic film. Solid acting and directing, a compelling true story, and no unnecessary film cliches like a tacked on love story or people fighting and making up in the last 15 minutes of the film in some grandiose final scene.<br /><br />4 1/2 out of 5.
B00973902K|5.0|Am enjoying this upbeat song on my playlist - fun! I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a catchy melody and dancing!
B008JTK9NW|4.0|I liken this album to a good cup of coffee.  Coffee is not for everyone, but an acquired taste.  At first, I was a little iffy on the album, but being a big P.O.D. fan, I listened to the songs more and more.  Now, I find myself listening to it almost daily.  This album is a good mix of songs with deep meaning and just songs you can enjoy.  Very good album.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's smooth and classic Grisham and yet different enough to make it a pleasure. One never knows where this one is going and the ride he guides is a page turner.  It may not be his best overall tale but it ranks right up there.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Not a bad game.  However, there were times when it would not give you the pieces you needed and you either ran out of time or extras that gave you more chances...could be very frustrating.  But, it was a good time waster if you had time to kill.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is more like a Facebook game that like Oregon Trail.  I was looking forward to more like an Oregon Trail type of game, not Frontierville or whatever it was called on Facebook.  Sometimes it will not let you pick a certain item on the screen and keeps highlighting another object near by.
B00914JWSW|3.0|Honestly, I was disappointed with this production.<br />I expected a higher quality from Barbra.<br />I know now why she did not release this one,previously.<br />However, i still enjoy listening to her.Her voice is still outstanding.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Sunken Condos is the kind of CD that you can put on as background music or listen to with focused attention. For decades now, I've especially loved the chords and chord progressions that Fagen uses in his solo albums and his Steely Dan albums. His vocal style is something you either enjoy or you don't. So whatever your existing opinion is of this vocalist, that's how you'll feel about this CD. This particular album is easy to listen to and to enjoy.

B008CLI3TE|5.0|I have enjoyed many Television shows in my life.  Usually in these shows there is one or two characters that carry the show, the plot is deep enough to keep me watching, and there is something unique about the show that makes it stand out (locale, premise, etc).  With Game of Thrones, you are overwhelmed with all of this.  It is truly amazing just how deep each character is.  The acting is top notch.  The dialogue is full of amazing phrasing and powerful quoteworthy one-liners.  The world of Game of Thrones is as diverse and beautiful as our own, but different in some really key ways to add to its lore.  The Blu-ray version is gorgeous when played on my HDTV and it is full of bonuses that really allow you to further understand the world, its kingdoms, and the falmilies that rule it.<br />All of this would be plenty to make this one of my favorite shows ever.  What's that?  You want more?  Well, did I mention the underlying supernatural elements of the show?<br />While the show in no way relies on its supernatural element to drive it forward, it is everpresent.  The Old Gods are there, dragons, the mysterious White Walkers, and magic (sorcery).  It is the icing on the cake for the show.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest gives me a lot of ideas for fun and ideas for travel. Great tool.  I would recommend it to anyone
B006JD48NM|4.0|Excellent and moving film about the late Ayrton Senna. What makes this film so particularly poignant is the use of real footage and interviews which follow the Formula 1 Champions career right up to his untimely passing. If you do not know much about Ayrton Senna or his career, this is a definite &#34;must have&#34; for any F1 fan. My only wish is that it contained more racing footage and car cam footage of his driving.

1616960922|3.0|This is a pretty good book, but not great.<br /><br />What didn't make this book great, in my opinion, was that (spoiler?) it seemed to be a frankenstein of left over and recycled ideas from Way of Kings Pressed into the Elantris universe. The magic system was entirely too reminiscent of soul-casting from way of Kings. In fact, he mentions that in the Epilogue, although I noticed it early on in the read. However, the fact that Brandon was aware of it doesn't make it any less....disappointing. Maybe he could have just used soul casting and set it in the Way of Kings universe...?<br /><br />I liked the main characters Mai, and Gaotona (although I thought it would have been a good twist that Gaotona was either a Forger, or had been soul forged as the reason for being different than all the other Grands), and there was suspense, action and some heart-warming sentimentality.<br /><br />I would be between 3 and 4 stars on this, but for 10 bucks, get it at the library. It's a good enough read, but not worth the money for it's length and so it gets 3 stars.
0307719219|4.0|It is a great reading, it gives you the answer of why nations fail? with plenty of examples, really prenty.<br />You can see their point of view is totally western, because the inclusive nations are the USA and UK. no other contries achieved incluive institutions. I liked whrn they talked about the gradually inclusive virtuos circle, I thought that was pretty intersenting and very logical. I liked that interpretetion.<br />But I would like that the authors to think about how the USA plays a principal role now in the creation of exclusive institutions in Africa and Latin America.

B007EE4XKI|4.0|David Mack has a talent for writing stories as large as the entire Star Trek universe. His stories are set on a grand scale, threads from disparate parts of the universe are woven together, and new plots form from old stories most people think have long been closed. Persistence of Memory was no exception. Like most of his other works, this one rewards avid followers of Star Trek (both in TV and novel form) while also proving accessible to those who may not know what happened in one thread or another (a lot has happened in the years since official canon went dormant, after all). Cold Equations has the potential to be a great trilogy, almost on par with Star Trek: Destiny, which I imagine will not be paralleled for quite some time anyways.<br /><br />However, I did want to voice a concern about where the novels have been heading. We have seen plenty of the core characters meet their end in ways that bother us but also make watching or reading Star Trek worthwhile. Sisko and Data, to name two, each had a \\"death\\" of sorts at the end of their respective series, and Janeway and, most recently, Kira faced similar fates in the novels. In their place, we've seen many original and interesting characters develop in their own right. Vaughn, Tenmei, Choudhury, Kadohata, Chen, Elfiki, Eden, Shar (and his rather dysfunctional family), all of them were able to find a prominent place in their respective relaunch novels...but only for a time. All of these characters have either died, left the main thread or have been reduced to the status of bit players. And in THEIR place? The characters that left before them (all except Kira, but we all know she's destined to make a return)!<br /><br />I understand that readers feel a need to bring back all the original characters that made Star Trek great, but the recent novels have felt more like a course correction than a truly real development of the Star Trek universe. It suggests to me that what has taken place since the end of the canon isn't nearly as important or as treasured by the fandom, and that seems disappointing to me. Don't get me wrong, this was a great read that I took apart in two days, and I look forward to the rest of the trilogy. I will, however, be dismayed if this series is little more than a device to return things back to the good old days.

B007R3AZNK|5.0|Some friends turned me on to JB a few years ago.  I have seen him live and have most of his CDs and the RAH concert on Blu-Ray.  Until now, Sloe Gin has been my favorite.  This CD is as good.  I was a little hesitant as JB is such a prodigious recorder and some discs are better than others.  His web site offered a couple of videos and a free download and that was enough to convince me to buy this one.  I was not disappointed!  All of the songs are really good.  The songs offer variety while remaining faithful to Joe's style.  If you are reading this, you're probably a fan already.  Buy this.  You won't be sorry!

B00936A2SM|5.0|When three acclaimed musician's musicians get together the result can often be disappointing, but in this case it's nothing short of stellar. Scott Henderson (Tribal Tech, Zawinul Syndicate), Jeff Berlin (Bruford, ABWH, Allan Holdsworth) and Dennis Chambers (McLaughlin, Funkadelic, Santana)is delivering high-octane fusion power trio at it's very best.<br /><br />And not particularily depending on virtuoisty and blistering superfast soloing - although there are plenty of that - but more on great compositions. Mostly Weater Report related with tunes by Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter that are giving a true jazzy treatment exploring the harmonic content as well as providing excellent vehicles for soloing.<br /><br />Together with John Mclaughlin's [[ASIN:B008S847X2 Now Here This]] this is testimony that fusion is very much alive and kicking in 2012, one might even say, it's better than ever!

B009B8YZKS|5.0|I saw this blu-ray for preorder on amazon and I had no idea what it was.  After a little searching I found it on youtube and wound up watching the whole thing. It is an excellent series and I am definitely picking it up on blu-ray.  Great special effects, great acting, just a joy to watch.
0439023483|3.0|Okay, first off, I didn't hate this series.  Far from it.  It was a page turner for me, except for all the war scenes and planning, and by war scenes I mean in the third book.  I usually stay away from war stories as all that stuff puts me to sleep, but I digress.  The first book was great.  The story moved along really well and it was everything a wonderful story should be.  There were of course questions but you feel confident you'll get answers in successive books, which you do, in the most painstakingly written, overly detailed manner imaginable.  Book 2 was hard to get through, it was actually painful at times.<br /><br />----------------------------SPOILERS!!!!----------------------------<br /><br />Something else that was a little hard to swallow was Kat and Peeta.  All those times when Peeta was in her bed and nothing happened?  Seriously?  How many teenagers do you know, Ms. Collins, or people who live in constant fear and worry for that matter?  I know this is a YA book and the characters were young, too, but given what they've been through, even before the games, and given that they were beyond their years as a result of their lives, I think it would have been okay to allow the characters to move forward in a very real sense rather than circle the drain for the entire book.  And besides, most people would make what little time they have left in this world, count.  They just would.  With all the details she included about everything else, every little thing, sometimes inconsequential things, plus all the mind-numbing inclusions of war and politics and all its variables and monsters and the horrors of war, I really think she needed to include at least one love scene between Kat and Peeta SOMEWHERE in book 2.  That would have been an awesome paycheck for our patience and diligence.  It didn't have to be detailed for goodness sake, but it would have cemented our affection for this pairing.  As it is, she takes us only so far caring about Kat's potential loveaffairs with one guy or another but all her feelings are never realized or actualized, so in the end all the flirtation, all the near misses and things said and unsaid just comes off as unconvincing, trite and juvenile.<br /><br />It's fine if Katniss doesn't know who she loves more.  These things SHOULD take time.  You shouldn't jump into a relationship under bad circumstances or \\"just because\\" and they're both great guys and she has an amazing connection to both of them and it really doesn't help that Katniss is emotionally retarded, but Collins dropped the ball on the human nature side of things.  As longwinded as the 2nd book is, it really seems like it's an attempt to fill up space to make room for a 3rd book.  After what happens to Peeta in the 3rd book, I no longer care about Katniss or her romances.  And given that this series was centered around those very things from the very start, that's saying something.<br /><br />The 3rd book -- I just don't know where to start or stop.  Okay, to be fair, Collins really delves into the realism of war and does it really well.  She has a great imagination for all the Capital's crazy weapons and put a lot of work in describing them and what they do in the goriest of details, but after a little while that got tired really fast.  The momentum built up by the previous books is forever lost because so much time is spent on training, healing injuries, and other subplots.  They never get back to building Kat's relationships so she never gets out of the one-dimensional stage.  Nothing about:  The beaus, her mentor, her mother or just figuring out who Katniss herself is.  What does she like to do when she's not hunting, what are her dreams, let's hear some good memories.  She's just always The Girl On Fire and man that old quick, too.  I love girl power and all that and having a healthy image of a girl who's kickass instead of wobbly and silly like Bella Swan who literally falls apart at the slightest of setbacks, but Katniss isthe polar opposite and not necessarily in a good way.  People grow, people mature, people make mistakes and hopefully learn from them.  That's what was missing in Twilight and it's missing here, too.<br /><br />Her life can't always have been bad.  We got one story about how her dad sang, making even the birds stop and that's more or less it.  For a girl who was so upset and devastated over her father's death, we never learn anymore about him.  My dad died when I was 8 and I never quite got over it.  I'm 40 now.  In spite of the fact that I've forgotten so much over the years, there's an awful lot I still remember and cherish...and miss.  I wish I had known him better from a more grown up perspective instead of a little girl one.  I have so many questions only he could answer.  I wish I could tell him so many things and I wish he could have been there for all of my life's ups and downs.  He was my best friend, my Knight, the one person who loved me unconditionally growing up.  Attending my graduations, scaring my beaus, walking me down the aisle, holding my babies - He missed it all.  None of that's ever mentioned in the books.  So when she talks about missing him and how life was hard afterwards, I'm neither convinced nor impressed.<br /><br />Instead, Katniss just gets homicidal.  She's just single-minded and on a single trajectory and that made her one-dimensional to me.  Because grief takes on many forms.<br /><br />Collins spends a huge amount of time making Katniss suffer through half the book without Peeta and when she finally gets him back he's been fractured into a million pieces.  I could say that that was incredibly disappointing and horrifying, but the truth is it was brilliant.  That's exactly the way I imagine it would be and exactly what the Capital is capable of doing to him.  It was incredibly heartbreaking that they couldn't have the homecoming they deserved - that we deserved.  And what's even sadder, is that's the last time you feel any hope forthese two.  After nearly three books, that's the closest we get?  Unsatisfying doesn't begin to cover it.  The rest of the book is cold and calculating.  From there on, he and Gale are slowly pulled away from her and Kat is turned into another person.  Granted that happens in war and the rest of the book is about the war and its atrocities and that's where it goes to hell for me.  The horrors within were so unappetizing I almost stopped reading it several times.  This is a YA book.  12 and 13 year olds will be reading this and it's all melting people, people being chopped up and descriptions of torture in gory detail.  I just don't know what the hell Collins could have been thinking.  It's written well enough, it describes all the horrors of war really well and all that goes with it in a very realistic sense.  I just didn't want to read that.  I didn't want that to take the place of all the storylines we've invested ourselves in for 2+ books.<br /><br />If that's where she was always going to go story-wise, I feel like the first two books completely mislead me and that annoys me more than anything.  I expected a war but I didn't need a play-by-play to such a degree.  It literally took half the book.  I expected a resolution in the love triangle but I thought it would have some kind of definitive declaration of Kat's feelings (as in she FINALLY figures out who she wants) but we don't get that, either.  She mentions love once or twice but she never tells it to them.  It's not until the last chapter that she says anything and when she does it's matter-of-fact.  Something to the effect of \\"we started over again,\\" or something like that.  That's it, that's what we've been waiting all this time for!  That's the whole crescendo, that's what three books and a brutal war with all the losses she's suffered and all that's happened, that's the grand finale.  A half-sentence lukewarm admission of - pshfftsh - who knows.  I don't even know what you'd call it.  No mention of Gale, no mention of her mom, no mention of her mentor.  Just an off-the-cuff mention of being PTSD and getting married and pumping out some kids.  O how romantic.  It's quite literally not anymore touching than what I just wrote.  Katniss speaks so unaffectedly, that I quickly become unaffected, too.  I'm completely at a loss to how to feel about it.  I guess I'm glad for her, I did want her to end up with Peeta, but I wanted to be a witness to it.  Didn't you?  Isn't that why we're here?<br /><br />Extremely anticlimactic and unsatisfying, that about sums it up.  And just so you know, I didn't expect a happily ever after.  I knew there wouldn't be, how could there be?  I expected her to lose half or more of the people she loved.  That happens in war.  I half-expected the possibility of Katniss dying or at least one of her beaus, maybe both.  Imagine my surprise.  Not everyone that comes home from war is so messed up that they stop living.  I know a lot of soldiers and believe me, if it's one thing soldiers know how to do when they come back from their deployments is LIVE.  And lots of it.  As much as they can do or are allowed to do.  Even the ones who are really traumatized by the war seldom stay that way.  It's true, some are so messed up they never come back.  But for the most part, most of them come back bit by bit.  Katniss it seems never does.  I know she says she does at the end, but I'm not convinced, or moved.  I expected more.  I expected a writer of this caliber and imagination, to come up with an end that involved feeling, growth and real affection and inflection, rather than focusing on weapon specs and military procedure.<br /><br />Plus, most of all, I thought we were going to watch Katniss grow into a woman, not just a soldier.  For example, when the proposition of another Hunger Games using the Capital's children is discussed - no one could really blame her for feeling this way, so soon after her sister and all, but this would have been an excellent time for Katniss to search within herself and ask herself, `What Would Peeta Do?' because so many times during the series, although she's brave and smart, she only ever thinks about herself.  And she does so again and this was at the end of the series.  For all she's gone through, Katniss hasn't grown an inch.<br /><br />Maybe Haymitch was right.  She doesn't deserve Peeta.  But I really, really wish Collins had convinced me she does.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This movie is quite different from the trailer, which makes it seem like a comedy... it's not a comedy, although there are some laugh out loud moments.  It's a sweet charming coming of age film about 2 odd kids who find each other and try to run away together.  The set design, the color, the acting all reflect the quirky story.  I highly recommend it if you are looking for a sweet film that will leave you smiling.

B005J7K950|5.0|I loved this version way back when it was on VHS and the soundtrack was being played on the radio. This is very fun to watch, nicely edited with color and (minimal) sound effects. The subtitles help give it a very timeless feel. Brigitte Helm gives one of the most powerful female performances of all time. Recommended for Rock music lovers all over.

0765348276|5.0|I had very few expectations going into Old Man's War. Not because Scalzi has a bad rep, because anyone had said anything but glowing remarks, just because I wasn't personally familiar with the series. I found that the book read ridiculously fast but was truly enjoyable. The first evening, to my also reading wife's dismay, I found myself laughing out loud four or five times. John's wry humor really struck a chord with me.<br /><br />As the characters progressed through the book I find myself in awe along with them and they learned of the technological marvels that they were unaware of existing in the their world. Scalzi takes a couple time-outs to explain faster-than-light travel or how the rifles theoretically work but he never strays so far into hard sci-fi to put anyone off.<br /><br />The story has the option of becoming predictable, repetitive and tiresome. Instead, it remains delightful, interesting and funny. I strongly recommend Old Man's War.

I can attest to the fact that a person can lose several pounds, (25 pounds for me) by eliminating wheat products from his diet.  My DH symptons also cleared up almost immediately.  I do not know if all of the other claims are factual for positive health effects, but for celiac disease it is true.  I got  rather bored reading the same information over and over.  Also the nutritional details got overwhelming.

I found that it was cluttered with too many unnecessary scenes which made it drag on and on.  I'm not really sure why I kept reading .... I must admit I did a lot of skimming through many pages.  I did find the characters well developed and not easily forgotten.  The storyline was interesting, but took way too long developing.  Sorry to say .... rather disappointing.

B008LA7RMK|5.0|THE BEACH BOYS TODAY!, the group's first Capitol album of 1965, is probably their best album (along with the follow-up, SUMMER DAYS (AND SUMMER NIGHTS!!!).  Both titles were originally issued [[ASIN:B00005A1N2 as a \\"two-fer\\"]] in 1990, split into individual CDs in 1994, reappeared as a Canadian import \\"two-fer\\" in 1997, and were remastered and reissued as a \\"two-fer\\" in the USA in 2001.<br /><br />Until now, THE BEACH BOYS TODAY! has only been issued in mono (although Capitol did issue a fake-stereo Duophonic mix in 1965).  This was done at Brian Wilson's insistence; because he preferred mono, only mono tapes were sent to Capitol.  The next Beach Boys album to be issued in stereo was 1968's [[ASIN:B00000DQP2 Friends]].  Some of the TODAY! tracks have been issued in stereo on various compilations over the years, but the new 2012 version contains the entire album in stereo for the first time (except for the spoken-word track, \\"Bull Session With The Big Daddy\\").  Both the mono and stereo mixes are excellent, and there is not a bad track in the lot, from \\"Do You Wanna Dance?\\" to \\"Good To My Baby\\" to \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\" to \\"When I Grow Up (To Be A Man).\\"  I always preferred the album version of \\"Help Me, Ronda\\" to the single version (\\"Rhonda\\"), which probably puts me in the minority of Beach Boys fans.<br /><br />If you have the \\"two-fer,\\" keep it for the bonus material, but this new version is a \\"must-have\\" for the terrific new stereo mix.

1451620829|2.0|I have been a HUGE KISS fan since the beginning so naturally, I bought this knowing that I would question alot of what he says yet hoping that after all these years he'd gotten over some things. Apparently not. I found the book very interesting and really enjoyed different aspects of the book. I found myself feeling bad for Peter through different parts of the book including his childhood, teen years, and dealing with his cancer and other health issues. However, I never found myself feeling sorry for him in anything regarding KISS. He came across as very conceited (he was the best singer in his mind- funny) and was a habitual complainer and whiner. His solo career went nowhere but it wasn't his fault, etc, etc. In fact, nothing ever seemed to be his fault even when he was on drugs. Everybody ELSE held him back in his eyes.<br />He seemed to write the book just as a forum to rip on Paul, Gene, and even Ace. He even told alot of things (if true) that should've stayed out of the book in my opinion. It was pretty sad some of the places he went in regards to his former bandmates.<br />I got the book wanting to hear his story and wanting to like him better. Instead, I read the story of a bitter, bitter man who is no longer one of my childhood heroes. What a disappointment.

This book follows on from story of World War 1 in The Fall of Giants and to World War 11 where the children of the characters in Fall of the Giants are going to war again and how their lives are affected by the political situations in England, USA and Europe.  The book is so engaging and politically factual at the same time weaving a story of family life and love.  A must read.  Love Ken Follett.
B0007KIFGE|5.0|This is one of those movies I've always heard about but just now finally watched it.  Wow!  I should have watched this sooner.  One of the better movies I've seen in quite a while!  Interesting and exciting from the minute it begins till the minute it ends.  Of course through the whole movie you know the guy is going to survive, but getting there is a real thrill ride.  At times his survival seems improbable considering the situaitons, but all in all I would say the movie was done fairly realistically.  I bought the dvd used but after seeing it I'm going to go ahead and get the Blu-Ray.  This is an instant classic to me.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Phantom is an excellently written and acted, powerful and riveting music drama.  I couldn't stop watching it.  It combines the best music with high drama.

I'd recommend it to anyone who wants an<br />entertaining evening.=- Maggie

B001TCHDPS|5.0|We saw \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" so ordered both of Rodriguez's CDs.  We love them both!  His music is so good, and his lyrics are very meaningful and from the heart.  We love his personality and humbleness and how he is able to put his thoughts into words.
B003OBJV5W|4.0|The Bee Gees were, and still are a treasure; their showmanship is unique unto themselves, their vocals on this particular offering are first rate; and there will never be anything like them again in our lifetime.<br /><br />That said, the reason I felt it did not rate 5 stars was that one of the most enjoyable elements of their concerts was the banter between the three brothers, this is missing from the DVD. I watched it when it was originally broadcast; and was hoping those aspects would not end up on the cutting room floor, but to a large extent they were.<br /><br />One of the main reasons for a live concert is to experience the communications between those on stage, and those in the audience. My reason for renting was to see if the DVD release was as enjoyable as it had been when originally broadcast before I made my purchase; the music, the vocals, and quality of recording was spot on, but it seemed the entire DVD offered not much more than live recordings of their greatest hits.<br /><br />I would love to see the concert \\"One for Australia\\" circa 1989 released on DVD; it contains the wit of their humor, and excellent renditions of their songs.<br /><br />All in all it isn't a poor offering; it's just not as good as it could have been.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I've got a 97 explorer. don't want to put money in for a new radio just for an aux input-besides I like the the big buttons(I often wear gloves when driving) of the factory radio. I also don't like wires. This gadget fits the bill perfectly. The shuffle mode could shuffle better (so use ipod or something w headphone jack if that's a prob) and some frequencies might have a whine or hiss; but when you skip around to find a good bandwidth- this thing sounds tits! (I found some this thing can override some lo power station frequencies, and some stations don't broadcast all day and those frequencies are open so try everything) now I want to get some speakers because having my favs encourages me to turn up the vol on road trips. Being ably to use a usb drive saves me the trouble of battery concerns. easy navigation, plug in, tune, play. F'in great. No probs w lighter plug in fitment either, but I do worry if over time that might be the case. I unplug it when leaving the vehicle just so it's out of sight; just hope that action doesn't over stress the joint and plug. I just love having the option to listen to what I want to listen to when driving now - with no commercials or non-news segments!

B0084IG8TM|4.0|The Hunger Games is a movie based on the popular trilogy by Suzanne Collins. This movie is a huge hit and is amazing! The actors and actresses are amazing at doing their part. However, there are some parts where the camera is extremely unsteady (like running with a handheld camera) and might give the viewer a headache or make them nauseous. Also, the story is a little bit off. Like, you never learn Foxface's name. This movie is about two hours long, and since this has another disc with AWESOME special features and it has UV (ultra-violet, it's for viewing movies on the go), this is a great deal for everybody! Please note that this is PG-13, but I would show it to anyone who is not strongly disturbed by the books. :) A little bad language, but that's it. See this movie ASAP!!! It's great!!!
B009VB97EY|1.0|Rent it later for a buck, borrow it from a friend, if you're already paying for premium cable channels it will be on soon, or wait for it to land on free tv, just don't waste your hard-earned money on buying the dvd. The first few minutes of the movie start off well-enough. Mike (our promiscuous, construction worker/roofer played by Channing Tatum) befriends Adam, his new, young, lazy and aimless co-worker (Alex Pettyfer). Mike uses Adam to attract customers to Xquisite (a ladies club). During the course of the night's strip show an emergency creates an opening and inexperienced and underaged Adam is put in the show as a substitute. Easy money keeps him coming back. Meanwhile, Mike wants out of the biz to get into a \\"real biz,\\" namely making \\"cool\\" (weird) furniture. Alas, he is stymied in his efforts to break into an honest living in much the same way that his love interest (Adam's sister, under-acted by Cody Horn, who was only given this role because she is the daughter of a big-time hollywood studio exec). ANYWAY, this movie has a very predictable storyline, very predictable. Anyone with half a brain knows exactly where it's headed. This is true of many movies, but the journey in this one is painful. Soderberg directed this movie, and that is the only reason why some critics gave it a good review. Soderberg has done some very good work, but this is not one worth bragging about. It drags because it's so poorly written, and the acting is so low-key, like everyone is trying so hard to be cool, that the characters seem like they lack interest in their own lives. The ONLY fun thing about this movie is the dance sequences, but the dance sequences total about 8 minutes of the whole movie. That leaves a lot of really boring \\"acting\\" scenes to trudge through. This movie could have been fun, but instead it's DULLSVILLE.

B008EZVNO0|4.0|When I first heard this CD, I thought it was weak and more of the same. But as I listened to it more over the past few weeks, it has grown on me and I see it for the solid, good work it is. It's not a 5-star album (such as Astral Weeks, Moondance, Into the Music, et al.), but it's a really solid collection of songs of a master craftsman.<br /><br />I listened to it as if other great Morrison albums didn't exist, and I realize just how good it is. Because he has written so much other great music, it's easy to dismiss this as more of the same. There are some weak spots, but overall, it's REALLY good. Yes, it has his familiar songwriting stamp throughout, but he's just doing what he does best: producing some really good music with a lot of soul. This is the most cohesive work he has done in years.

B009SQRL4U|5.0|\\"Operation: Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\"... Is beautifully directed by Sarah Smith. She spins out a whole new animated theme of the Christmas scene, headed-up at and coming out of the North Pole.  What's first asked is: Just who is actually in charge up there?  It would be either the current Santa Claus (Jim Broadbent), who comes down through the generations with each Claus portrait hung on the wall, or the up-and-coming, heir-apparent, eldest son, Steve (Hugh Laurie).<br /><br />While the current Santa (usually awaiting a nap) is more of a position-holder up-north, Steve is in complete control with a militarily disciplined style. With the elves, and everything that needs doing, he's hyped for \\"efficiency and productivity\\".  The younger and kinder son, Arthur (James McAvoy), obviously operates from the heart. He's in charge of receiving all the letters to Santa and making sure the children are getting what they need; he believes that Santa is the \\"Greatest Man Ever\\".<br /><br />In a quaint town in England, little apple-cheeked Gwen slips her annual letter to Santa Claus into the post box with the highest of hopes. She begins an opening monologue asking a whole lot of questions about, and of, Santa Claus: \\"Why?\\"-this and \\"Why?\\"-that, including her doubts of whether or not he is even real.  Her friend told her otherwise while Gwen... Still Believes!<br /><br />We see an entirely orchestrated Christmas Eve night enfold... Steve is at the helm and in the complete direction of all 'operations'.  His father is Santa, and he's delivering the toys along with the new, high-tech elves ('1st. Field Elves Battalion'). Steve is choreographing everything behind the scenes, to the most minute of detail.  Upon Santa's return to the North Pole, following so much action, the counts are tallied and everything stands as... \\"Mission Accomplished\\".<br /><br />This is with the one exception. We soon discover, after Santa's family  finishes their Christmas meal around the table, that a child was forgotten.  That child just happens to be Gwen. She didn't receive her toy and she is still fast asleep.  Arthur is deeply disturbed by this, as he is the one who read her letter, and Santa's own father is also as upset with this situation.  Wisecracking Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) is old-school and came before this new, ultra-controlled way of handling Christmas and handling the children. He may be a lot of things, although he genuinely cares and also for Arthur's position as the 'Number Two Son' in the family. He misses the old ways and traditions held throughout his own generation of being the Head Claus.<br /><br />Arthur and Grandsanta join forces and switch back to the old sleigh  (endeared \\"Evie\\") and reindeer team in favor of this new, high-flying, techno-ride that Santa is using now. The two of them, along with an elf friend, take off to find the sleeping, and still believing, Gwen.  The race is on...<br /><br />There is plenty to see in this film with the animation and picture quality vividly done. The Christmas Eve scene at the very beginning is Hyperactive; with the elves in unison performing their tasks, jumping off of suspended ropes that seemingly hang from the sky, skiing all over, and viewing through green-glowing, night vision goggles. The North Pole is so well represented by color, light and hustling and bustling  everywhere. Even the dark blue night skies are blanketed in grand style, with a gorgeous mantle of shimmering stars. A truly happy Christmas movie that we enjoyed immensely!  Merry Arthur Christmas...hild was forgotten.  That child just happens to be Gwen. She didn't receive her toy and she is still fast asleep.

B007REV4T8|4.0|As someone who grew up with the James Bond movies, from Sean Connery up, I love them all.  This one is no exception, but I can also tell you it did not have the same OOMPH as the prior Bond flicks.  It was not Daniel Craig.  I love him as Bond.  It was the actual story line--great but not excellent. The stunts seemed noticeably less than normal, as well as the romance.  Judy Dent returns as \\"M\\".  Her wonderful dry British humor seems to enhance her personality for playing the dry, tough, unemotional head of Intelligence.  (We know the emotions are all there, but well-masked.)<br /><br />The flick begins with an opening chase on motorcycles, across rooftops in Istanbul.  From rooftops, we jump to a racing train.  From a distance another agent watches, as \\"M\\" in London directs her to \\"Take the Shot\\".  The bad guy is carrying a data pack with all the agents' names and pictures, so the steaks are pretty darned high.  As things begin to escalate, there appears to be an attack on the British Secret Service.  We travel to Macau, and later to Scotland in our movie seats.<br /><br />Great film, great actors, including Ralph Fiennes at MI6 Intelligence and veteran great Albert Finney (who does not seem to be mentioned anywhere in the writeups) as the tough old caretaker of Bond's Skyfall estate in Scotland.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I cried.  I am a dog person so this really resonated with me. The spirit of the dog (narrator of story) was believable and loveable.  This was Ultimately a feel good novel.

B009MF56GC|3.0|If you walked into the theater, or view this at home, please do NOT think this movie has any credibility, plausibility, or a plot that you will get deeply into. Just like the action flicks from the 80's and 90's this movie is meant to be overkill and silly, filled with gratuitous violence. If you want fun thats what you get. Seeing the old gang of action people, and some sports legends is pretty cool, but of course it's ludicrous. Blowing away 20 men with one weapon, (remember Commando), cheesy one liners, (remember all of them), and something that resembles a story (few have), is what this film is all about. And it's just that, fun violent over the top fun the whole family (CAN'T) enjoy, but the older folks should. ;o). So there isn't a whole lot to say, though the acting is normal, it's not bad, at least for who's in it. You get what you paid for, loud guns, explosions, ridiculous amounts of blood, body parts flying around, and best of all \\"nearly\\" every action star from the 80's and 90's. Here is the list of \\"important stars\\" and their ages, added up of course. Enjoy. It is pretty cool to see the geriatrics all in one nursing home war!! (Except the guys under 50 of course). They still have it.<br /><br />Stallone-66<br />Statham-45<br />Jet Li-49 (wish he would have been in it more, he had prior obligations they say)<br />Lundgren-55<br />Norris-72--(CHUCK ROCKS)!<br />Crews-44<br />Couture-49<br />Hemsworth-22 He doesn't count, he's a kid!! ;0)<br />Van Damme-52-He seems older.<br />Willis-57-I like Bruce<br />Arnold-65- He wants to reprise his roll as Conan, (I plead the fifth). cough.<br />Grand total age of-------554 YEARS!!! Wow.<br /><br />It's worth one watch, that's about it. I hope after this the OLDER guys retire. Although Stallone's Bullet To The Head looks decent, it seems predictable.

B0085RQLXK|3.0|I've been a fan for years, I love the band (as in I have seen them live over a dozen times in my life)and like pretty much everyone else, I like the \\"old stuff\\". I did hear bits and pieces of the old sound in this album, but found it to be a strange mix of albums like Toys in the Attic and Just Push Play. I really miss the hard hitting guitar and fast pace of songs like Toys and Rats and was never a big fan of songs like Jaded, so for me the whole thing really just didn't work.<br /><br />Again, I love this band, but it really seems to me that since Steven's injury and battle with drugs resurfaced there has been a disconnect that comes through in this album. No one is on the same page anymore. They really need to work out their personal sh!t before going back into a studio, or use some of that aggression towards each other to make a really kick a$$ album like they used to know how to do. The closest they have come in recent years would probably be the song What Kind of Love Are You on, which was only released on the Armageddon soundtrack (which I personally think was a waste of a great song).<br /><br />There are some decent songs on here, but not enough to redeem them. Sorry boys, I love ya, but I want my old Aerosmith back.

0439023513|3.0|After reading the first two books in the \\"Hunger Game\\" series, I was somewhat influenced going into the third by suggestions from friends, that the third was not as good as the first two.  I have heard others say that Suzanne Collins seems to lose steam in a series.  Based on my own opinion I could find some of those comments true, as at times I found the third book very hard to finish.  Sometimes I lost interest, or in some ways just got lost in finding my way.  The third book being totally different from the first two, and having the main characters already established, new ones seem to get lost in the shuffle and story as well!  The author in addition seems to be in confusion at times, and it seems she has a hard time keeping things flowing in order and content.  Still if you are persevering sometimes the rewards are great.  If you hang in there without giving away the ending, I can say if you can make it through some of the muddled content, the last few chapters will bring all the pieces and meaning of the 3 books to a close.  I can only hope that the series of movies to be made will keep up with the quality of the stories to be told.  Once again hang in there as good things come to all who wait and persevere.

193413712X|4.0|Paul Harding's novel is poetry in prose.  It is amazingly well observed and reported, particularly on things in nature.  The challenge is keeping one's bearings, to know what is happening when, but it all rapidly falls into place.  It is not a subject that immediately seduces you, but it manages to etch a life on your mind in  most interesting detail and with restrained emotion.

1742200206|3.0|Lonely Planet New York City has nice color photographs and succint descriptions of NYC highlights such as Central Park, Times Square, and Ellis Island. Music fans should appreciate the inclusion of famous venues like The Village Vanguard and The Blue Note. New York's most famous museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, also recieve mention. However, Frommer's New York City is a more in depth book with more valuable information. In addition, this book contains information that may become outdated, such as the best Broadway shows that are currently playing. While this is interesting, it is subject to change. While the book is not bad, I would recomend Frommer's New York City, as it has more valuable information and ie less likely to become outdated.

B0064Y5U24|1.0|Honestly, I don't see the hype about this commercialzed, over-hyped, overrated, and UNTALENTED slew of hacks that the American mainstream industry passes off to ignorant people as a \\"rock band.\\"<br /><br />There is literally NO edge, angst, depth, creativity, and especially not any real talent involved here, be it vocally, lyrically, or instrumentally. All they talk about is the same stupid, lame, generic trash, including: Sex, relationships, heartbreak, love, and pretty much any of that other tripe that everyone has heard hundreds of times before. YUCK! Make it stop! These guys are by far the biggest disgrace to rock music in the history of rock music itself.<br /><br />These guys SUCK!!! Simply put. Any band that is comprised of musicians who have been playing instruments for no longer than a couple of months can put out a better album than this steaming pile of dung that people like to call \\"music.\\" I cheered when I heard they had rocks thrown at them in Portugal. It was about TIME someone put these hacks in their place, and it would have been better if Chad got a rock in the mouth, so that he could stop singing once and for all, and this garbage \\"band\\" could stop putting out trash.<br /><br />Also, the fans of this band are some of the most clueless drones I've ever met in my life. ALL they can do to \\"defend\\" their talentless saviors is to use the already over-used jealousy card, or say how many records they've sold, how rich they are, how many concerts they've sold out, or pretty much anything else related to their popularity, rather than the actual quality of their \\"music.\\" Yes, they are big and popular, I get it. But what about the actual MUSIC??? Argue me that!!!<br /><br />If you are going to trash me and try to defend your precious saviors NickelHACK, please let me say that I don't care. You will only prove your own stupidity, and not to mention how UNEDUCATED you are about music. NickelHACK are not even real musicians to begin with, and if you support them and this type of generic, corporate-based trash, then we have nothing to talk about. Your opinion means nothing to me, because you don't know good music, and you are just following the hype that's out now, letting the media force-feed you and control you like a robot.<br /><br />Please allow me to return to my Symphony X, Stratovarius, Within Temptation, Rhapsody of Fire, Voyager, Borealis, Kamelot, and many more REAL bands that make REAL music, and who are in it strictly for the ART, and not just for the money.

0785163174|5.0|[[ASIN:0785163174 Avengers vs. X-Men]]<br /><br />First off, I'm not going to try to debate the content and quality of the story in this review because everyone knows that opinions are subjective and unique to the individual.  Myself, I think the low scores given for this item are a bit misplaced. Personally, I would assume that if you're the kind of person who is willing to pay up to $75.00 (retal cost) for a comic that you haven't read or, at least, researched enough to have an idea whether or not you will like it before you buy it, then you've got more money than brains.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I've got stuck with a few stinkers myself, but I never buy anything over $20.00 blind.  That is a rule I try to stick to.<br /><br />That being said,if you are one of the many people that have read some or all of the series and enjoyed what you read enough to want to have it collected in a beautiful hardcover edition...then this was MADE for you! If you are someone who hasn't read any of it, but think that this may be something you would enjoy reading...then do some research...check out some previews...and then if it feels right, get this Hardcover collection before it's gone! This book, at the price that Amazon is offering right now, is a STEAL!  Let's say you were going to buy the issues that this HC collects at the individual cover price (which ranges from $2.99 to $4.99 an issue)and the included digital copy which costs the same per issue as the print copies if you were to download the individual digital issues(you could buy the slightly cheaper digital collected edition for $59.99 on Comixology), means that by buying this edition, you're going to get nearly $200.00 worth of content for less than $50.00!<br /><br />As for the book itself, the art ranges from kinda out there to really great and the story is nothing that hasn't been done before many times, but it was still well done and a very enjoyable read. This book really spoke to that 12 year old little boy inside of me that had always dreamed of seeing what would happen if the biggest heroes in the Marvel Universe THROW DOWN for a good old timey free-for-all!  Needless to say, He was not disappointed! Overall, this was very light, but very fun read for me and a great lead-in for what's to come! (Marvel NOW!)<br /><br />My Final Verdict:  Story - 3 Stars, Art - 4 Stars, Extras - 5 Stars, Value - 5 Stars<br /><br />Overall: 5 out of 5<br /><br />Also, on a side note, I really love the idea of Marvel including free digital copy and I really wish they would do this more often.  This really needs to be the new industry standard for all graphic novels and storyline collecting trades. If it were, I would be more inclined to buy more print books instead of always going digital.ide of me that had always dreamed of seeing what would happen if the biggest heroes in the Marvel Universe THROW DOWN for a good old timey free-for-all!

0439023491|3.0|Bear in mind that these texts are meant for young adults and when one remembers that then they should get a little more slack from adult readers.<br />\\"Catching Fire\\" is a page turner, just as its predecessor was, and there are some really neat ideas that Collins employs, especially in the section of the novel that takes place in the Arena. I won't say more because I don't want to spoil plot points for anyone. When it comes to plotting a book Ms. Collins is quite good at it. She is very weak at characterization though, and for some reason it bothered me more in this novel than it did in \\"The Hunger Games\\".  I really don't know why. I liked the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, in the first book but in this text she annoyed me at times and seemed kind of insipid.<br />I agree with many readers who say this book is weaker than the first, I think it is. However, it is still an easy and enjoyable read and you will tear through it quickly.<br />The ending is very weak, and rather unconvincing, but the plot points must be set up to get into the final book of the trilogy and so I am not as bothered by it as some other readers appear to be.<br />\\"Catching Fire\\" really is in its element when it depicts the many forms that rebellion against authoritarian power can take, and that is a positive message for a disengaged young generation to be inundated with, and I am glad that so many young people seem to be reading these books.<br />As for me, I will certainly read the final installment of the trilogy, and I look forward to the defeat of evil and corruption that I hope it brings.
030758836X|1.0|I heard so many good things about this book and I have to say the author is clever and it is well written.  The perfectionist desires of Amy magnified due to her situation were very well developed and too many people do think a relationship to be good must be perfect.  But overall these people are so unlikable - I did not want to return to the book to spend more time with them.  I did persevere hoping for that murder/suicide ending - but alas - that did not happen.  It is a very popular book - so someone must enjoy this stuff.  I think the author is good - very good - but I don't like her stories just the same.

I have always enjoyed Howe's and Palmer's musical talents and I would have liked to have had these parts more up front in the mix (like the first two albums back in the 80's).  Downes keyboards are good once again.  John Wettton is solid once again as a lead singer and a terrific bass player.

B003MC5N28|5.0|The Giver is a different variety of dystopian fiction, not action packed and full of violence like much of the current crop. Instead, it's a thoughtful, beautifully written story , almost lyrical.<br /><br />It begins with Jonas and his anticipation of the annual December ceremony, where every birthday for the year is celebrated, another way of assuring \\"sameness\\". But this year is special. As a Twelve, this is the year when, after a childhood of evaluation, he will be assigned his role in life by the community elders.<br /><br />The community is not evil or power mad or abusive of its people. Instead, it provides for all of their needs. Everyone is polite and respectful of each other. But something is missing. We follow Jonas as he gradually discovers the flaws in his world and, along with his mentor, The Giver, realizes the need for change.<br /><br />There'll be a tendency to label this YA only or even middle grade, because the main character is twelve. But I think this is a book for all ages. The story is at times touching, tragic, and melancholy, but always told with an understated simplicity that makes what's happening even more moving.<br /><br />The Giver is an emerging classic. I'm surprised I've missed it until now. For lovers of this genre. It won't be the wild ride of The Hunger Games, but it will stay with your long after you're done.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|this game is amazing! and I had so much fun with it! but on the bonus chapter, the part where you usethe glass cutteron the tank, makes it force close every single time! I just want to play the game..... please fix it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy browsing through the entries. Some make me laugh and I have been known to be touched by others. Pinterest has so many different venues to enjoy. I will recommend it to friends.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The characters were made more believeble in this second book and their love for each other is growing as they get to know more about their pasts. It's an intense relationship but it is so nice to see people getting over their problems and fighting to be free of their ghosts. Finding someone to share your journey is a gift that must be cherished.<br />I had a great time reading this book and I can't believe I will have to wait 4 months to get to the next book.<br />Congratulations Ms. Day.
B0092C2X7U|3.0|This game is ok but it is not really worth it. it comes with only 8 levels. and if you want more you have to pay $1.49 to upgrade.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have been following the Scarpetta series for years. Personally I feel the character is getting whiny and full of herself even more than usual. The ending of the book was a dissapointment. It's as if Ms. Cornwell realized she had to wrap it up quickly and was not sure how to do so. It was a stretch. The Canadian murder could have been left completely out and not made a difference in the book, matter of fact it only left me wondering why it was included.

B008I3QZKU|5.0|I think that the general assessment of The Killers' \\"Battle Born\\" has been way too negative and unfair. I think we are in a time when there are very few bands in the classic rock genre who write good songs and release interesting albums. Of course, you can not deny that The Killers, since the group's first two albums, have lost some edge and thus become more mainstream, but the good songwriting is absolutely still there. A comparison with bands that could be put into the same category like Coldplay or The Foo Fighters, The Killers won't fall through in any way through. Or what about yawners like \\"Nickelback\\"?<br /><br />I find it hard to point out really weak numbers; you might, though, find \\"A Matter of Time\\" or \\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" less interesting. On the other hand, it is very easy to find strong new songs that have both durable melodies and powerful vocals by Flowers; wrapped up in well tested rock arrangemets. At random I could bring out \\"Here With Me\\", \\"Fleah and Bone\\", \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\", \\"Runaways,\\" \\"From Here On Out\\" and \\"Battle Born\\".<br /><br />I feel quite confident that this album will go down in history as one of their most successful.

B008RTE08E|4.0|The Beatles have left a legacy within great portions from monumental to experimental.  And it is the latter, which shows in their 1967 BBC Christmas special \\"Magical Mystery Tour and one of the last projects that the band had to fulfill after Manager Brian Epstein's death.  The wackiness of a \\"Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help,\\" unfortunately is lacking in this film, and there appears to be an attempt to recreate the animation but with much eccentricity.  But fans and the Beatle curious may want to keep in mind that the film and the soundtrack came out after the legendary \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\" and yet another transition that was happening not only in the band member's personal and musical lives, but the beginnings of a counter culture and revolution of the 1960s youth.<br /><br />The film shows the members of the Beatles and their cast of unrestrained actors in multicolored scenes that appear not to make sense.  But with the sound of the band's post Pepper production, one can say that the band has progressed with the allotment of songs that are included in the film and the album and British EP that was released there is the that continuity of creativity and experimentation by each member that differentiates the Beatles image and sound apart from the rest of bands and artists that attempted to emulate the band's sound and image.  For fans that have followed the numerous re-releases of the film, this most recent release and re-mastering of \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" lacks a certain quality that previously releases possessed, such as the first re-master that came out over almost 20 years ago - the picture quality had much more clarity. But by far, the soundtrack itself has only improved for this release as well as the additional previously unreleased clips that accompany this release, \\"Your Mother Should Know,\\" the almost student-film like quality for \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and a new cut of \\"Fool on the Hill.\\"  Other surprises include Traffic's \\"Here We Go Around the Mulberry Bush\\" where viewers can see a very young Stevie Winwood.<br /><br />The DVD or Blu-ray will be a nice additional to one's collection, especially for Beatles fans that never grow tired of the band's music in various forms.Mulberry Bush\\" where viewers can see a very young Stevie Winwood.<br /><br />The DVD or Blu-ray will be a nice additional to one's collection, especially for Beatles fans that never grow tired of the band's music in various forms.
B0072OFM28|2.0|Listen, I'm a fan. A big one. I own Season 1 and Gods Of The Arena. There was this continuity, flow and rhythm. You were drawn in and it felt as if you'd known the characters forever. In \\"Vengence\\" they introduce almost a whole new cast. Who are they? Where is the connection? The writers apparently chose to slap us across the face with numerous new story lines so as to shift the focus from the loss of Andy.<br /><br />Liam, God bless him. What is he?...19 years old?? Spartacus appeared to be a man in his 30's! Why would the producers make such an obvious mistake? He may look somewhat like Andy but he could not act like the Spartacus we've come to love and cheer for. I gave Liam 4-5 episodes to grow on me. It just never happened. The remaining cast is brilliant.<br /><br />I am disappointed. I bought the \\"Vengence\\" series to find out what happened after the blood bath in \\"Kill Them All\\". This new season is full of rabbit trails and I found myself lost at times. I really wanted to love this season as much as the first two, but I don't. :( Things pick up around episode 6 but it should not have taken that long to rev things up.<br /><br />I don't regret the purchase. It was worth it to see what happens to everyone else in Spartacus's world.

0446580848|2.0|I am a great fan of Mr. DeMille and have read all of his books, some of them two or three times. What has always fascinated me is his uncanny ability to write in many  different genres, cop stories, travelogues - Up Country&#34; - and simply good mainstream novels like Gatehouse&#34; or Gold Coast&#34; and always combine good writing, action and background. And most books are nicely seasoned with humor.<br /><br />The Panther&#34; to me is quite the opposite: continuous witticism seasoned with almost no story, excepting some action in the final 10% of the book. One could say witticisms interspersed with narrative. And sometimes the witticisms are not only bad but definitely in bad taste.<br /><br />And that the plot and the actions of the protagonists are somewhat (to say the least) improbable also is not to Mr. DeMille`s credit..<br /><br />The reason why I still give the book two stars is due to the fact that what I learned about Islam and the failed state ofYemen was quite interesting. But I could have read this in a textbook without being bothered by 5 to 10 witticisms per chapter.<br /><br />It is really sad that a great writer has to fail like this - and what really pains me is that this is the third time in a row  that this happens to me (I recently gave one star to Larry Niven for his Bowl of Heaven&#34; it and hated  it to Lee Child`s &#34;A Wated Man&#34;  but was too lazy to write a review. Hopefully my list of favorite writers will not continue shrinking -

086571701X|1.0|There is nothing here that an hour with Google can't replace. Her \\"science\\" is lacking at best, and completely false everywhere else. Core issues of the process are given a very biased and cursory treatment. There is however a good bit of time spent trying to lay not so subtle support for her $1,300 packaged \\"system\\" (two tubs and a pump on a T.V. stand).<br /><br />\\"The covers of this book are too far apart.\\"<br />  - Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914)<br /><br />A quick example of the author's depth of wisdom:<br />Her comparisons of artificial lighting choices refer to lumens, which are a unit of measure that is relative to what the human eye can register. Were aquaponics a system for growing or impairing human eyes I suppose this might be useful. Plants \\"see\\" light differently. They use different parts of the spectrum for different things, and this is pretty much completely ignored.<br />She continually refers to the process of water draining and being replaced by new solution provided by a pump, as a process that sucks oxygen into the media. Physics and fluid dynamics be damned.<br />Her contention that magnetic drive pond-type pumps are the obviously superior choice just adds to her credentials as a bloviator of the first order. The multitude of reliable circulating pumps available that are more efficient, longer lasting, more reliable, etc. is but one more example of just how limited her knowledge and/or research on the subject is.<br />On one hand she champions \\"earth friendly\\" practices, while forgiving her own system's and suggested practices that don't even begin to fill the bill. Me thinks her an opportunistic fraud.<br />Her suggestion that her methods will result in a system that never needs cleaning is complete idiocy. The very process that she is supposedly such an authority on, is the very essence of soil creation. As this process occurs, there will be a build up of solids and... oh what's the use. She doesn't have even a basic understanding of 8th grade science, marketing and sales... yes, but science... nope.<br />The differences between chlorine and chloramine are Aquariast 101. This is news to the author. One can be agitated or evaporated off, and the other not.<br /><br />Not much original thought here, much about what others have done or are doing. Were quotes, reprints, and cut and paste commentary from her own Googling endeavors edited out, I've no doubt the book would be reduced to a pamphlet. It literally takes her 70 pages to get to the first real potentially useful bit of information about aquaponics (once past her mindless world view politics and pseudo-science), but unfortunately, even this is nothing original. Save your dough and spend 20 minutes watching You Tube videos.<br />She actually suggested using Twatter as a source for product recommendations... gimme a break!<br /><br />There are lots of people that manage to keep fish alive while growing plants, and also in intensive aquaculture, in spite of their best attempts at killing everything. Where fish in a closed system are concerned, there is no such thing as too clean. Most of the variables that are left dangling in the author's process can and will create stresses for the fish, but using the idiot tolerant tilapia, they have a decent shot at surviving anyway. Do yourselves and your fish a favor and learn how to care for the animals in particular, properly, before you attempt anything more complex<br /><br />Just about anyone can kill enough fish and plants to eventually work this all out, but thinking that this \\"author's\\" extemporaneous ramblings are going to provide a solid basis for avoiding those pitfalls would be a false hope. Take some time to learn about raising and caring for fish, and some plants, individually first. There's plenty of great information on fish keeping and gardening sites to help you accomplish this. You'll doubtless be provided with a broader knowledge base than the person selling this book.<br /><br />I suggest questioning the testimonials and interlocking support offered by others in the so-called aquaponics community. Understand that this is her and another seller of junk cross branding and vouching for one another. Trust your own instincts and intellect. You must be smarter than the average bear to be interested in the subject in the first place, so don't waste your time and money on these wannabe's and sales people trying to separate you from your hard earned dough.ing the testimonials and interlocking support offered by others in the so-called aquaponics community.

B0045INTVA|4.0|This version of Apocalypse Now--Redux--is the one to see, at least as an instant video on Amazon. The picture is brighter, the sound clearer and the pauses fewer than with the original. The original film as seen on instant video is visually dark and murky and both the original and Redux have some instances where the movie stops briefly, but these pauses occur more often with the original. A couple of scenes have been added to Redux and their value can be debated, but this is surely one of the two or three classic Viet Nam films.
B004SBX112|1.0|Just lost version 3.0.1 (and all progress) as it reverted back to 1.3 after an update recommendation on my kindle fire! WTH Rovio and Amazon?<br /><br />BTW, I love the game, especially the added levels that were part of recent updates. But this &quot;update&quot; blows!
B009186JYI|5.0|So very glad to see the release of Peter Whitehead's film \\"Charlie Is My Darling,\\" he is also responsible for Allen Ginsberg's \\"Holy Communion\\" from '65, \\"The Beach Boys In London\\" from '66... shot with the road band while Brian Wilson perfected \\"Smile\\" at home... and \\"Tonight Let's All Make Love In London\\" featuring incredible stage riot footage of The Rolling Stones, Syd Barrett-era footage of The Pink Floyd and other great insights to the legendary mid-'60s \\"Swinging London\\" era.  It should be said that The Rolling Stones, though their career has been very long, have a prime, and \\"Charlie Is My Darling\\" is shot right at the crest of that prime.  Brian Jones is still a healthy, motivating force in the band, and without him, The Rolling Stones lose a ton of dynamics in their recordings.  So it can be said that the first five or six Rolling Stones albums are the hardcore goods, and that \\"Charlie\\" captures the personality of this legendary combo when those first six releases were the focus.  The work they are doing at this stage of the game was the primary inspiration to all of the great American '60s Garage Punk bands later compiled on the \\"Nuggets\\" series of box sets and LPs (along with The Yardbirds, Them, Kinks, Pretty Things and Beatles).  A good indicator of the Rolling Stones' range is the inclusion of the early \\"long\\" song \\"Goin' Home,\\" which soundtracks a montage of the group's road experiences.  The segment in its own way delivers a more realistic version of what The Beatles captured in their first movie \\"A Hard Days Night,\\" or, something more like the Maysles Brothers film of The Beatles first U.S. visit... but with a more proto-psychedelic touch.  \\"Charlie Is My Darling\\" is a rare open book to one of the high points in rock 'n' roll history... it may not appeal to hard rock fans, but that's just it; the original Rolling Stones were an actual rock 'n' roll band, based in a more '40s/'50s R&B thing than predictable '70s \\"rock.\\"  Their music was based in thereal folk blues, but expanding right before your eyes within the context of this film.  - Domenic Priore, author of \\"Riot on Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood\\" (2007 Jawbone Press, London, available on Amazon.com)

B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie is the perfect combination of wit, creativity, and a classic feel. A lively score and divine cinematography bring the film to life. A stunning story of Suzy and Sam.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I love Woody Allen movies, but have to admit that, from around 1980 onwards, it has been a case of hit and miss with his output. Midnight In Paris just reminds you of why you may have loved his movies in the first place. Quaint, charming, cinematic, and brilliantly shot. Also innocently funny, yet with plenty of messages to ponder, some subtle, others less so. I remained captivated for the duration of the film, as did my husband, kids and an elderly uncle. There was enthusiastic applause at the end of the film from everyone.  No dull moments at all in this picture, as your eyes move from one beautiful scene to the next.<br /><br />The concept is sheer genius: a wannabe American writer (played by the marvelous Owen Wilson) finds himself in Paris with his fiancee, dreaming about the magic of the city and its mesmerizing impact on those American literary giants who graced its cobblestone streets in the first half of the 2oth century. Only he isn't really dreaming when midnight rolls around, or is he? There is Ernest Hemmingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and a host of other characters who pop in and out each scene, giving you (and the film's protagonist) a chance to experience the glories of the age. There is ample name dropping, and you have to pay attention to notice that, yes indeed, yet another influential figure has made a cameo appearance... Picasso, Cole Porter, etc. It is a sheer delight, and I will enjoy watching this again and again. More of the same in the future, please, Mr. Allen!!!
0425263916|1.0|I wanted to like this book, as I had enjoyed Bared to You, but felt Sylvia Day really rushed this thru' to get it out while this genre is still hot.  Talk about overdone!  Two things drive me crazy about certain romances--the insane stalker threat guys who have no real motivation or sense of reality and misunderstandings between the lead characters that could be cleared up with one minute of adult conversation.  This book has both.  Come on, Sylvia, do better for the finale.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|Good Movie & understand it is base on true events.  Could have used more depth of characters without all the drama. A short background of each would have been nice.  I brought it to present to my grandchildren. Also the documentary should have been tagged on for viewer's history.

B008NABUU8|4.0|Solid little game.  Runs well on Samsung Galaxy Siii.  Awesome as FAOTD.<br /><br />Some levels require some serious thought for Truck loads.
0345803485|2.0|Like many others who have reviewed this book, I thought I should read it given \\"everyone\\" else was.  I have not quite yet completed the book a few chapters left.  I do have to say, I can't wait until I'm done with it and can say good riddance.  I found myself getting more and more frustrated with the book as it went on between the writing skills of the author, the use of \\"big words\\" sporadically as if the author remembered at that moment Christian and Ana were smart (felt contrived and like the thesaurus was used), and the unrealistic view of it all.<br /><br />This book doesn't really take you an adventure.  The sex scenes are fairly lame given the two main characters are so young.<br /><br />If you love to read, don't waste your time on this one.  Need erotica? Go with an author like Zane or another author that offers a steamier more realistic book.
B0055XCETW|5.0|I bought the season pass in HD to watch on the big screen. It's a great show obviously aimed at high school and college aged females, though I suspect the creators/writers/actors never dreamed that guys would be watching this show as well. Perfect to watch while the show is on break and re-watch episodes while going \\"oh yeah, i remember that.\\" Can't wait for the winter preimer of season 3 to start in January.
1401207529|5.0|Because he's believable. Because he's the most human hero, with flaws and doubts, but he's moral above all.<br /><br />Frank Miller said \\"He's clearly a man with a mission, but it's not one of vengeance. Bruce is not after personal revenge... He's much bigger than that; he's much more noble than that. He wants the world to be a better place, where a young Bruce Wayne would not be a victim. In a way, he's out to make himself unnecessary. Batman is a hero who wished he didn't have to exist.\\"<br /><br />I loved this book! It explores the troubled lives of both Bruce Wayne and Gordon and from the sample script pages it is obvious David Mazzucchelli followed every word in his beautiful drawings. In this story, things are kept realistic and yet extremely entertaining. After reading each page I thought to myself: \\"wow, it fits so well , they've thought of everything!\\"

B005LAIHY0|4.0|Prometheus is a well acted and action packed movie that keeps you on the edge of your set. However, as a avid \\"Alien\\" fan it doesn't provide all the \\"answers\\" that the previews promised. In fact Prometheus offers very view answers to the original questions posed in \\"Alien\\" instead it sets up more questions and a potential sequel. As a stand alone movie it is still very enjoyable and the blu-ray is clear with lots of extras that let you dive into the movie.
B005EGXTHG|2.0|This book had a lot of promise. Potential for a great book. Some good twists and turns but I leave this book wanting a bit more from the story. Hopefully the 3rd will be a lot better.
B00936A0ZW|3.0|Ohhhh no preview? no buy, Sorry in the digital era and no preview? the reason is so important to hear it before buying this album is because before I have had some major disappointing buys with Paul's Music. Why 3 stars?, Well since I haven't hear it I can't give it 5 but also I can't say that is bad either so I wont give it less than that. hopefully I can hear it sometime and see if buy it, but in the mean time please put a preview!!!!!!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Great follow up movie.  This leaves me waiting hard for the 3rd installment.  I always like Jon Favreau, but I think his real talent lies behind the camera.  I hope he stays there for years and continues to entertain us with wonderful film.

B007THA4FI|4.0|The Casual Vacancy was ultimately a very good story. However, I found it very difficult in the beginning because there were so many characters and they all seemed somewhat disconnected. In the middle of the book the plot became very thick and again I had some difficulty with all the people but the story was so interesting that I had a hard time putting it down. The affect of one man's death touched so many people in so many different good and bad ways. I could not give it 5 stars because of the disconnection I felt in the beginning. The last half of the book was the best.

I kept thinking maybe it will get better and it did not. I would not tell anyone to waste their money on this one. I bought this book on the strength of her name and the fact that I loved her Potter series and would be hard pressed to buy any further books she writes till someone else spent the money first and said it was ok. Sorry J K Rowlins but I know you can do better.
0345525558|5.0|I loved this book. Heart-wrenching story about a girl who endured foster care to come out on the other side without the ability to love. Although parts of the story are very unbelievable (I have never known someone to come into such success business-wise without trying.) But if you put those small details aside, it is an amazing, beautiful, and for me, life-changing story.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game and so worth the money.  Good graphics and a nice little story to go with it.  I'm looking forward to Enigmatis 2.

1476715904|5.0|Slammed is the first book in the Slammed series by Colleen Hoover. After her father unexpectedly dies, 18 year old Layken, her little brother, and her mother move to Michigan. Layken immediately meets her new neighbor Will, a hot 21 year old guy that she instantly forms a connection with. Unfortunately, they find out their relationship is forbidden, but how do you stay away from someone you have to see on a daily basis?<br /><br />I mostly read the Paranormal Romance genre, but I have to say that Slammed is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I believe it falls under the new genre called New Adult, and this genre is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Layken is still in high school, but she is 18 and the obstacles she faces are larger than the typical young adult book. She helps to take care of her 9 year old brother Kel, who reminds me so much of my son. He is an endearing boy with quirky habits, and I had a soft spot for him.<br /><br />I fell in love with the love story in this book. It was amazing. I always like books that have a forbidden romance aspect to them, but in this one you could feel the heartbreak and emotions of the characters.<br />It all felt very real and believable. It was intense. The plot was amazing. Underneath the love story, you have this other heartbreaking story playing out and the different emotions mixed in were like a roller coaster ride. I read this book in a day, I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This book has some wonderful secondary characters who you will grow to love. The ending wrapped up nicely, and could actually have been a stand alone book. I'm glad that this is a series though and I will get to read more about these characters. However, I was a little unhappy with the epilogue. I won't say what happens, but the epilogue takes place one year after the main story ends. I wasn't happy about missing out on a whole year, I want to know what happened during that time. I hope the next book has a plot that is just as amazing as this one.

B008D19WBQ|1.0|Could Warner Brothers BE more lame? I am SO not buying this. I was so happy when my email inbox read \\"Friends blu-ray now available\\". Then I looked at the product only to realize it is an inferior product passed on to a new format. I laugh so hard with the DVDs, I really don't want to miss a joke. I can live with the relatively bad image quality of the fist few seasons... When WB retracts from selling an incomplete product, I will be more than happy to lay down the cash for a complete one.

B009157BWU|3.0|I wasn't as impressed with the story as I had expected to be. Photography was fantastic, good story line, but I was a bit disappointed overall.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Movie was good. I did not see the first Avengers movie, so I didn't have any background, but I am familiar with the characters. It was good (although some things were pretty dumb, like Thor falling for the Loki thing in the chamber), but at some points I was sitting on the edge of my seat.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I anxiously awaited this new book and it didn't let me down.  Morton does such a great job of creating memorable characters.  I was sad when the book was over.
1416550550|5.0|I was skeptical at picking up this book to read.  I had never heard of Kate Morton.  My bookclub selected this book, and I am very happy that they did!  A book has not gripped me like this one in a long time.  I found myself hiding from my family to get this book read, and when it was over I was so sad.  I had fallen in love with stories, and most of the characters.<br /><br />This book flips back and forth between the stories of 3 women, from 3 different generations.  There is a mystery to be solved.  How did a little 4 year old girl end up on a ship from London to Australia all by herself with no adult?  This book will grip you from the first page.  There is a garden maze in the sotry with many twists and turns.  This story also has many twists and turns.  Everytime I thought that I had this story figured out the author added another twist.  When I was reading this book I actually felt like I was there with the characters.  I could smell the sea air, and hear the birds chirping.<br /><br />I remember this story for a long time to come.  I highly recommend it!
0525952926|3.0|Neither the first nor the second books in the trilogy feel like they were written by Follett himself. There are inconsistencies between the two volumes, and quite a few editing errors.  Errors that no self respecting editor would tolerate.<br /><br />I will read the last book when it comes out.  Bottom line:  Follett's earlier books were much better.
B0033807C2|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian was a great book if you have read the previous four books. There was suspense, excitement, tragedy, and also a great hope for what is going to come. The next few Heroes of Olympus books were very good as well. Get into them.
B000JQTWPO|5.0|I was familiar with the title but had no idea about the story until I saw it in the free top 100 for kindle and thought 'why not'. I enjoy 19th century literature anyway but even when you remove the social and historical elements this is a fantastic detective story with interesting characters and an ever twisting plot. I have read it twice since my initial download and just bought a hard copy to give my mum for her birthday (as well as recommending it whenever I get a chance).

0425264351|1.0|I never like to be too negative in a review but this book just pissed me off. This is by far one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. I can't grasp why Lee Child became a best selling author, maybe I should try now that I know anyone can do it. I don't know what was worse, his short sentences explaining every detail in starting a car or getting a flashlight from a garage or his horrible unbelievable ex-military Jack Reacher character. I'm sorry but there is no way I see a guy like that dancing around with a cop laughing and giving high fives. The story didn't even carry it. This was truly one of the hardest things to not stop reading because I wanted to finish and not just throw it out.<br />First off, the book could have been about 300 pages shorter and nothing would have been missed. A lot of things I just don't get in here also, a couple of times Reacher is so full of revenge for a death of a loved one that he says that he'll never stop until he kills all who are involved but then turns around and says it's too much for today and I'll rather have sex or go to a bar in a different state for the night and start tomorrow. Yeah, I want that guy to avenge me... And he does this twice.<br />I was looking forward to this because of the new movie coming soon but now I will never read another of Child's books. I'm surprised it has such good ratings. Shame.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This was a fun mystery with lots of twists and turns to keep it moving.  Good dialogue and characterization.  Fun to relate it to “Castle “ TV program .  It was a GOOD READ.

1451695195|1.0|Since this book addresses the Christian beliefs of God, heaven and hell, I feel it appropriate to use the Bible to prove this book is extremely misleading.  This is a good example of what the Bible calls false prophets.  Matthew 24:11 says &#34;Many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.&#34;  He may not realize that he is one but he fits the description.  The most dangerous characteristic false prophets have is that there is always what appears to be a modicum of truth in their teaching.  In this case the existence of God and heaven.  This author was on Fox and Friends Thursday morning, November 8, 2012.  During his interview he answered questions people emailed in as well as from the hosts of Fox and Friends.  Here are some of his answers, which is assumed to be what he learned during his trip to heaven, but that proves his experience was not what he believes.  &#34;God does not punish people for being non-believers; there is no hell.&#34;  His answer about the lack of punishment for non-believers was for a woman whose atheist husband recently passed on.  She asked if God would punish him for his non-belief.  Technically, the answer was correct since non-believers have chosen where they will spend eternity.  Since it was their choice not to believe, they will not spend eternity in heaven.  Proof of this can be found in Matthew 10:33 when Jesus said, &#34;But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.&#34;  As for whether hell exists, hell is mentioned a total of 54 times in the King James Version of the Bible.  Some versions of the Bible use different names for the same place.  It is true though, that God does not punish someone like this.  Instead, God honors their choice.  Unfortunately, there are only two choices and the alternative to heaven is hell. One specific passage of the Bible tells the story of the rich man and the beggar Lazarus (Luke 16;20-25).  Lazarus begged only for the crumbs from the table of the rich man but never got them.  When he died, he went to heaven.  Later, when the rich man died, he went to hell and was able to see the beggar in heaven being comforted.  He cried out for mercy and just a drop of water on his tongue  to quench his fiery thirst but a great divide kept either one from the other.  The rich man was also denied a request to warn his brothers.  He was told that if they wouldn't believe someone who was living (the prophets), they would not believe someone coming back from the dead.<br /><br />This author claims there is no hell, contrary to Jesus' teachings.  He claims an atheist can go to heaven, contrary to Jesus' teaching.  He claims to have gone to heaven when he was a non-believer, as he claims that he wasn't sure that heaven existed before his ordeal took place.  The Bible contradicts this author's claims since he would have known that heaven exists if he was a believer at the time and could not have gone to heaven as a non-believer.  There are various other theological discussions as to why he could not have gone to heaven and come back but I believe what I have presented here is enough to reveal that this book will not give you a good understanding of the truth about heaven.<br /><br />It is encouraging to know that so many people are searching for answers but discouraging to know that many will be led astray by stories such as this.  The term Christian depicts someone who follows the teachings of Jesus, which includes claiming Him as your personal savior.  If this author was saved after his ordeal, that is good news.  However, the Bible also says that you will know the tree by its fruit and if this author was saved, he is ignorant of Biblical truths.<br /><br />I invite this author to reply and begin an honest discussion of his experience.<br /><br />JohnTalmadge<br />Lynchburg, Va.<br />Southern Baptist Deacon
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I really loved the story line, definately exciting and a lot of page turning events through out the book. Although I dont think adults would be fond of it, young adults and teenagers that enjoy the dstyopian genre will be thrilled by the fast pace and unexpected turns and the trilogy. definatey buy it!!!
B009VB97EY|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and well worth a viewing.  You've seen the previews so you know what it's about but it actually has a plot above and beyond the stripping and I really enjoyed it.  I loved the dance scenes, too.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have just recently purchased a 3D TV, a 3D Blu-Ray player along with 5 3D DVD's and I have to tell you I was not very happy with the 3D viewing.

B0085RQLXK|3.0|As a lifetime fan of Aerosmith, it hurts me to write this...<br /><br />This album reminds me of the time I eagerly awaited the arrival of a new restaurant in town.  After months of hearing how good it was going to be, then standing in line for over an hour when they opened, the food was placed in front of me, and.... blah!<br /><br />11 years after the still-born \\"Just Push Play\\", 8 years after the pretty good covers album \\"Honkin' on Bobo\\", and after several years of girly-slapping between Steven and Joe (and a revolting rumor that one William Idol would be the new lead singer!?!!?), finally word came that the 'Smith would be cranking up in full force again.  And the great Jack Douglas would be at the helm.  What could go wrong?<br /><br />Well, plenty.  First of all, Steven and Joe took co-producer credits, instead of letting Douglas run things.  Then the evil Marti Frederiksen was allowed to participate in the project.  Then they scraped the bottom of the barrel for a Diane Warren song (why won't that hack go away?).  Then they invited the lovely, but vocally challenged Carrie Underwood to attempt to sing on a song.<br /><br />For gawd's sakes!!!  They promised us an album that would rival \\"Toys\\" and \\"Rocks\\"!!!  I would have accepted something to rival \\"Pump\\" or \\"Get Your Wings\\".  Instead we get this?<br /><br />Now, I did rate this 3 stars, so I'm not saying it's terrible.  But like that restaurant I was talking about, it ain't what it should have been.  Too many cooks?<br /><br />One nice thing, as has been noted elsewhere, the album cover art is really cool.  If you look closely, you can see many references to past Aerosmith albums.<br /><br />Now on to the songs (Although I have the deluxe version, I'll only rate the songs on the regular CD):<br />1.  LUV XXX - This is a pretty good rocker, if you start it at the :57 mark.  Why have they insisted on these gimmicky openings to their albums ever since \\"Get a Grip\\"?  Why not just kick arse from the get-go, as \\"Pump\\", \\"Toys\\", \\"Done With Mirrors\\", and others did?  Anyway, this one features Julian Lennon (!) on harmony vocals, it and sounds strangely like Stone Temple Pilots to me.  But it's a good tune. +1<br />2.  Oh Yeah - Another good rocker with nice guitars and female backing vox. +1<br />3.  Beautiful - Pseudo-rap and production gimmicks take this one too close to \\"Just Push Play\\" territory.  Still, it's better than just about anything on that stinker.  0<br />4.  Tell Me - Tom Hamilton wrote this schlock!?!?  At least it has pretty good guitars. -1<br />5.  Out Go the Lights - This is the standout track.  A funky groove, great guitar riffs, harmonica, female vox, and filthy lyrics.  This is A-smith.  It combines the 70's vibe with the 80's/90's sound.  If only the whole album was like this. +2<br />6.  Legendary Child - Another one that ventures too close to the \\"JPP\\" sound.  But it's a winner, I suppose. +1<br />7.  What Could Have Been Love - This one was dug up from the litter box.... Don't get me wrong; I love me a good Aerosmith ballad.  But this ain't one of them. -1<br />8.  Street Jesus - I think the audio collage that begins this is supposed to evoke \\"Rats in the Cellar\\".  This song isn't nearly that good, but it's a fine rocker.  Tyler sings really well here.  Hellacious guitars starting at the 3:37 mark.  +1<br />9.  Can't Stop Loving You - Starts off interestingly, kind of like \\"What it Takes\\", then it quickly degenerates into an American Idol duet.  Carrie Underwood is best looked at rather than heard.  Sadly, the band plays pretty well here, but the song stinks.  -1<br />10.  Lover Alot - Even though it's kind of a forced rocker, it works for me.  More filthy lyrics!  The guitars at the end make it cool. +1<br />11.  We All Fall Down - Audio vomit, courtesy of D. Warren.  (I truly believe that Elvis, the Beatles, Dylan, the Stones, or even the Carpenters could not make a good record out of a Diane Warren song) -2<br />12.  Freedom Fighter - Kick-arse rocker.  Joe's voice is raggedier than ever, which is a good thing. +1<br />13.  Closer - Ummmm....Well, it has good harmony vocals.  And pretty good guitars.  0<br />14.  Something - Joe Perry sez, \\"Get the hell out of my way, Scarf-boy, and let me rock!\\" +1<br />15.  Another Last Goodbye - This band has had some hellacious closing ballads on past albums.  This one really tries, but it's horrible.  -1<br /><br />So those are my assessments of the songs.  If you add up my ratings after each song, they equal 3.  So this one gets 3 stars, coincidentally or not.<br /><br />Now, if you have the Deluxe version (or go on Youtube to listen to the extra songs), you'll probably agree that \\"Shakey Ground\\" and \\"Up On a Mountain\\" (vocals by Tom Hamilton!) should have been put on the regular CD.  In fact, if you get rid of \\"What Could Have Been Love\\", \\"Tell Me\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Closer\\", and the abomination that is \\"We All Fall Down\\", and replace them with \\"Shakey Ground\\" and \\"Up On a Mountain\\" on the CD, you'd have a kick-arse album.  In its released form, though, Music From Another Dimension! is only average.... It's weighed down by songs that are only there to sell product.<br /><br />Listening to this album, it's clear that the rhythm section is still tight.  Tyler can still sing and do his \\"rap\\".  Joe and Brad can whip any guitar combo out there.<br /><br />Boys, please give us that totally rocking album you promised before you can't anymore!<br /><br />Oh, and American Idol sux!!!
B005NFJAT4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The Blu Ray version showed alot of scenes that were deleted from my original DVD.  The audio on the Blu Ray is 5.1 Dolby Digital.  To some people, this might not matter but my husband and I have a surround sound set-up in our living room and this Blu Ray was outstanding, just like we were in the middle of all that was happening.  It would help if the audio version was posted on the site when advertising Blu Ray DVDs so as not to disappoint.

B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Ah,rovio come out with a new angry birds related game,this time from the pigs point of view.The point of the game is to build a machine for the pigs made out of any thing you would find in your garage:wood,engine,umbrella,fan, etc. to get the pig to safety.Simple right?Hardly I would go out on a limb and say this game is more challenging than any of the angry birds games combined.And I usually pass the birds games in one or two days but this took me a week to pass one world.So its a mind boggeler at best and some people may not enjoy it because it will get you frustrated and angry.But fun.Its free.go try it.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|This knife is extreme.  It is very well made, remarkably heavy duty, and razor sharp.  It has a 1/4 inch thick blade.  However....it's almost too heavy duty.  After all, it's only got a 5.5 inch blade......so that does limit it's usefullness as a chopper or a batoning knife.  It's not exactly lightweight either.<br />Sheath is very nice, but flops around a little due to the thinness of the belt loop, and the heft of the full tang blade.<br />A very rugged knife for camping or survival.  A regular Ka-Bar USMC style fighting knife with the 7 inch blade is probably a better choice: longer for batoning, and chopping....a bit lighter and easier to sharpen.....with more sheath choices.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I did not see this movie in the theater but I have heard that this was a &#34;prequel&#34; to &#34;Alien&#34;, the original 1979 movie. Watching this, I notice that the technology showcased between the two films were simular in style but the level of advancement in that technology for both stories was about the same to me. So I can not tell if this happened before, after, or during the same time period. For now, I will have to keep any judgement about it being a &#34;prequel&#34; on hold.<br /><br />But, this movie is well worth the purchase, especially on Blu-ray. And, it does well as a 'stand-alone' movie without any association to those other films. &#34;Prometheus&#34; has that Ridley Scott feel to it as you would expect from his previous 'SCI-FI' projects, and the imagery is a 'feast for the eyes'.  The story is suspenseful, shocking, and a little thought-provoking but that is Ridley Scott's 'Modus Operandi'. I can not expect anything less from this director.<br /><br />Yes, this film was not what I expected but I enjoyed 'the ride' none the less.

1609613937|3.0|McDougall presents starch in a \\"new\\" light sorta, and this is sorta good, because the anti-grain \\"paleo\\" dieteers tend to overhate grains, or even carbs in general, tho many of us are genetically \\"adapted\\" to eating grains and legumes. And this is \\"evolution\\"--it never stops, much less at some point when \\"we\\" were species-wise entrenched (or entanlged) in our paleo-ness. Less digressively, McDougall is, IMO, a stubbornist. He had his Big Insight about starch being the Way and Truth back in the 70s and has not really \\"evolved\\" since. A more evolved approach to food, IMO, is that of Joel Fuhrman.  McDougall's strict veganism, along with others, for example the irreparably sanctimonious Neal Barnard, gets kinda icky-- as if veganism is a form of fascism. Eating meat is \\"disgusting\\", says McDougall in a Youtube vidi.<br /><br />Hey, I admit I, me, myself, am a carbo freek, yet unlike McDougall's True Beleevers, I eat alotta nuts. As with walnuts, says McDougall in another Youtube vidi, it was, in bygone eras, \\"natural\\" to eat only a few, since their hard shells (before the great technology of nutcrackers came along) slow you down in your zeal to gobble a million of em. After all, says McDougall, it's only modern technology that allows walnuts and such to be sold shelled ready to eat in any amount we want or can afford. This access to unfettered nuts and seeds, tho, is no more \\"unnatural\\" than our starches--vej and grain-- being  packed,  shipped, and cooked with PETROLEUM. Whether straight from the equator or balmy California, a frozen soul in NYC can enjoy his hot pot of tropical mush (don't add oil, tho, because oil is a \\"processed\\" food) in the middle of a friggin blizard (as I did the other day).<br /><br />These \\" rice diets\\", these mono-diets, are best for FAT SICK peep--if yer trying to \\"reverse\\" a disease, maybe it's a good thing to avoid all oils and fats, or their sources, vegan ones too. This was discovered by Pritikin, Ornish, and a others whose medical specialty was/is heart disease. But I think the peep who need to do that didn't acquire that need because the did NOT eat starch, or because they DID eat a buncha natural nuts and seeds. They probably got sick because they ate garbage for decades. Then, desperately playing catch-up, a simple natural fatless \\"starch\\" diet is nothing less than Deliverence. If yer not sick, and desperate, and may you never be, eat a wider variety of foods than McDougall advocates. Just do it. Take this to the bank: No long-lived peep ANYWHERE avoid fish and/or meat and/or dairy entirely. Tho I am vegan (these days) I remain flexible. We'r not hypocrites just because we'r willing to change!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Enjoyed this book so much I could not put it down though I would say it was a bit repetitive at times especially the sex scenes
B007M6P01O|5.0|As long as your okay with a little goriness, this show is great. Every episode really gets you into it, you'll be genuinely worried for the characters at times. My advice to anyone considering getting into this show... Get a Netflix subscription for one month, and cancel it. 1 month of Netflix is only $8, and to buy the shows on here, you'd need to pay $57. Plus you'd be able to use Netflix for anything else, and even keeping the subscription for 7 months would be cheaper than buying them here. Hope I help some people watch this show for less!

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I love my sonic! The pen end comes off WAY too easily, but it is a kick to walk around the house sonicking everything! My younger friends wore out the UV ink quickly when they wrote all over their arms and faces to go clubbing (some had hash marks indicating they ran into the Silence and some had &#34;Run!&#34; and one even tried to write the whole &#34;Blink&#34; message!) I wish I could get a refill for the UV since I have &#34;secret&#34; messages written all over the house and want a few more hidden messages for my Doctor Who Christmas party.<br />Great light and sound action, decent quality, and just an all around fun toy for kids or adults.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm  amazed this franchise keeps re inventing  itself, with great results.

B003WUYP56|5.0|Lee Smolin does an excellent job of dissecting the enforced dominance of String Theorists since the 1980's. He also makes a very compelling argument for reforming the evaluation and hiring of young independent-minded scientists in the area of theoretical physics. He presents, as well, a cogent and understandable explanation of the fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics, the Standard Model, M Theory and, of course, String Theory. It's a treasure trove of information for an amateur like me.<br /><br />His argument gives rise to the legitimate speculation that perhaps many areas of scientific investigation, funding and personal academic success are impeded or even crippled by institutional rigidity. The NIH's War on Cancer comes to mind.<br /><br />As Slonim emphasizes, in an era that sees diminishing support for basic research, where most scientists look forward to a penurious and insecure career of endless post-docs and part-time teaching in pursuit of the coveted and rare assistant professorship, academia should be careful to include a wide diversity of opinion and avenues of exploration. To quote Niels Bohr: \\"Your idea is crazy, but not crazy enough to be true.\\"
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this game. Daughter lives it too.. Now I can't get her off my phone. Hours if entertainment on those boring doctor and dental visit
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|The premise of this book is intriguing, but like most books of this genre, the ending is pat. It's a good book if you're looking for something entertaining and relatively mindless to read.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Movie was awesome!!  Love the whole ALIEN story including this backstory... been hooked since the original back in '79....cant wait for the sequels!!  Great job Ridley!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Reviewer: Shar P. SLC, UT<br /><br />I randomly came across Wool & didn't know what to expect; it turned out to be the best book I've read in a very long time. The metaphor of the title couldn't be more perfect! A bit of &#34;Hunger Games&#34; meets Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; & then some! I don't give many 5 star reviews, but I would give Wool 10 stars if I could. Hugh Howey is an incredibly gifted & imaginative writer. I devoured this book in a day; I simply could not put it down! The suspense, anticipation & all the unforeseeable twists made every turn of the page a cliff-hanger. I can't wait to read more from Howey! I've told everyone I know to read Wool, it's destined to be a classic.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would give the book high marks. Decades ago I had my own NDE and this book rings true with me. Loved, loved, loved it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the game keeps freezing otherwise good. could get a lot better. other gameloft games don't have this problem. the end!
034580404X|5.0|I am not the type of person to pick up a book. I hate reading, and wanted to see what the hype was with these books. I finished all three books in about three weeks. I wish there were more than three books, but I guess it had to eventually come to an end. Good books to keep your mind entertain.
157421327X|4.0|Great book for a beginner, I love Zentangle and was looking for  a book with more examples. It<br />has some great designs to get you started.
0425263908|5.0|After I was done reading Fifty Shades of Grey I didn't know what else to read. I found this book by accident and I'm so glad I did!!! If you're a Fifty Shades of Grey fan like me you'll have to read this book!!! I'm not much of a book reader, but I was able to finish this book in less than a week. Must read!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the walking dead, the second season get's you ready for what's coming in the third season. Season 2 is just as fun & scary as the first season. The great thing about the second season is that you really get to know the characters more in depth. You feel like your a fly on the wall in each episode. Some great revelations in Season 2.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|My first encounter with one of the new \\"paranormal speculative fiction\\" historical novels was to screech to a halt in a bookstore and threaten to shout bloody murder. The very idea of Queen Victoria slaying werewolves or Abraham Lincoln taking after vampires offends my very historical-based sensibilities. Imagine my surprise therefore to take a chance on this big-screen adaptation of the novel and actually enjoy it.<br /><br />What unfolds over two hours is a movie of more charm than I anticipated, particularly in its delightful depiction of the introduction and courtship of Abe and Mary. Immense changes were made from the novel, which disappoints book fans, but as someone who hasn't read the book, didn't prove problematic. Some of the action scenes are truly jaw-dropping, even if they go in for a touch of the macabre and absurd (one vampire hurtles a horse at Abe, who then promptly rides it in pursuit). The costuming is beautiful, as is the terrific cast, made up of little-known (and some, not so little known) actors. It's an interesting take on \\"alternative history,\\" with style.<br /><br />Reading reviews, particularly from more conservative sources, I anticipated the film to be bloodier than it really was... either the black blood of vampires doesn't seem as gruesome as most R-rated action films or the stylized manner of shooting the piece diminishes it, because it didn't turn my stomach. It's true that there isn't much characterization, and it almost seems clich&eacute;d to turn a champion of the enslaved into a vampire hunter (the metaphor is evident) but it's something different from what we've seen before, and it may (however indirectly) encourage audiences to read up on the real man, who was far more magnificent than this one, if not as downright cool.
0525952926|1.0|HOW VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!<br />  I can not believe that the same author who wrote \\"The Pillars Of The Earth\\" actually wrote this book.  He must have hired a 14 year old to write if for him.  The language is very simplistic and  is condescending to any experienced reader (especially anyone who has been a reader of his previous books).<br />  If I wanted to read a book about World War II in a novel form, I would re-read War and Remembrance by Wouk.
B007REV4T8|4.0|The creators of the latest or modern Bond movies want to explore or expose a different side to James Bond's personality. That is what Skyfall is in part about.<br /><br />But I have a challenge for them: create a Bond girl and put her into the movie from the very first minute and keep her character alive to the very last minute. In my view, the Bond girls enter the movies too quickly or die too quickly and Bond has it easy. I would love to see Bond struggle to keep a Bond girl alive or to save or to interact with one for the duration of an entire full movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a really good book its will keep you on your seats waiting for the next book.  My son loved this book.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book asks if hard work and intelligence is enough to make someone successful or if there is more at play.  The book is comprehensive in its study and is easy to read.  I enjoyed it and found it very interesting.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who loves reading murder mystery/thriller types of stories.  It was like going through a maze with all the twists and turns the book took.
B005IQZB14|3.0|This book was a decent read.  I have to remind myself that this is a person in her 20's and therefore to have patience with her egocentric ramblings.  We read this book for our book club which consists mainly of women over 40 and there seems to be a consensus among us that at times we were all fairly annoyed by the main character.
B008KE3960|5.0|I think this is a fun free exciting fun game and in my veiw that's big coming from a 9 year old girl
B005PW3OS8|1.0|Just plain awful. This movie really sucked. The first twenty minutes was good, but it was all downhill from there.
0307949508|5.0|In \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\\" journalist Mikael Blomkvist is introduced to the misfit computer hacker Lisbeth Salander as she helps him solve the mystery behind a kidnapping that happened in a man's family. Here, it's time for Blomkvist to do everything he can to help Salander is an important time of need. The first book in the Millennium Trilogy laid down some crucial groundwork. This one executed the actions of the characters who know and enjoy following.<br /><br />The story follows how a couple who wrote about sex trafficking in Sweden is murdered and Lisbeth Salander is the one who is framed. She is also being accused of murdering her sexually abusive guardian, Nils Bjurman, and is having the knowledge of engaging in lesbian based activities with Miriam Wu going against her (which is typical tabloid information and should have nothing to do with the case). We begin to learn about Salander's past, how she entered the institution, and her family past, which makes for an exciting story.<br /><br />The previous book, which was excellent, has to do with Salander's talents, actions, and her interactions with society in everyday life. This book has to do with the occurrences in Salander's life that made her the person she is today and how she responds to being put on the spot as she has been. As \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" progresses, it becomes more exciting. It's like you're on a roller coaster, riding through rings of fire. Just incredible what Stieg Larsson could do and continue to build on the theme of men engaging in hateful acts toward women and that has been a recurring theme in Salander's life.<br /><br />If you loved \\"Dragon Tattoo,\\" you're going to really love \\"Played With Fire.\\" If you bought \\"Dragon Tattoo,\\" but didn't buy this one just yet, I have no idea what you're waiting for. This is the grand thrill ride!
B008MM9630|4.0|I like this game.  it still seems to need something more though.  I don't know what that would be, but something.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very good app. i like the extra info it has for voltage etc. worth dowloading for sure. obviously well designed
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book very much! Rick Riordan is one of my all-time favorite authors and I couldn't help but immediately pre-order the book.  I have been waiting for this book to come out for so long and as soon as I got it on my Kindle Keyboard I couldn't put it down for one second. I suggest this book for all ages and would recommend it to any of my friends.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Note: I have not yet seen the film & I have the score as mp3 files.<br /><br />John Williams' score for Lincoln (released in limited theaters yesterday and expanding nationwide November 16) is another sterling addition to Mr. Williams' gallery of excellent scores (Fiddler On The Roof [adapted from Jerry Bock's Tony award-winning score], Superman: The Movie, the STAR WARS & Indiana Jones trilogies [I omit the fourth film because I personally don't like it], Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park; The Lost World & A.I. Artificial Intelligence, to name a few). Mr. Williams has captured the feel of America in the late 19th century when there was a bloody war going on, but an even more intense war was being waged in the hallowed halls of Washington, D.C. Mr. Williams' score evokes the passion, power, hope, sadness, triumph and heart-breaking tragedy that surrounded the 16th president of the United States during this crucial time in American history. I'm certain that Mr. Spielberg does Abraham Lincoln full justice on screen, as Mr. Williams has certainly done so in this magnificent, epic and yet solemn score which evokes fond memories of Schindler's List.<br /><br />One Man Unites Us All. LINCOLN. Rated PG-13. Now in select theaters. Opens everywhere November 16th.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I saw my friend playing this game and wanted to download it.  now the thing wont download.  I know its only a dollar but what a rip off.  do not buy this.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I continue to find new authors via Amazon's self-publishing option, and I picked this one up purely based on the high score and the sheer number of reviews.<br /><br />Mr. Ryan sets an excellent stage very much in the same light as Patrick Rothfuss did where we start off meeting the character, and then the book dwells into the past.  What I liked about this book was that the hero and the supporting cast all had their place.  The book is mainly epic fantasy based in swords/kings etc.  Magic plays a minor role.  It didn't seem that Mr. Ryan fully knew what he wanted to do with his magic system although it did seem he knew he wanted it to be part of the world.  This could change as he releases book 2.  Without giving away too much this book mainly focuses on the hero growing up in the \\"Order\\" with other boys who learn to fight.  It reminded me a lot of Rothfuss' first book.<br /><br />This was one of those books that really had my attention and I found myself looking to go to bed a little early so I could read.  I will admit to bringing my Kindle to work and being a recluse over lunch as I wanted to read a chapter or two.  .<br /><br />There are a few editing mistakes, but I found them to be very minor.  From my side they did not take away from my enjoyment of the book.  Highly recommended!

B008Y1YJZY|1.0|This is the only movie I've bought that wont play on my PS3. After I put the disc in, and as another reviewer points out, I can see a preview, and then the PS3 stops responding. I've reset the PS3, and couldn't get it to play beyond the same spot. As another reviewer had the same issue (though, I'm not sure if it was on the PS3), I am accepting that the product is defective.<br /><br />Update: Tried it on my 3D enabled PC, and it locked up the drive. The green reading light remained on, and I couldn't eject the disc. WARNING: This could damage your computer or other device.<br /><br />AVOID!<br /><br />UPDATE: I watched the DVD version, and it's a pretty solid movie! Definitely not for kids. I will not try the 3D disc in any of my players, though, and will re-iterate, this product (the 3D disc) could cause damage to your hardware! And, yes, the PS3 plays 3D Blu-rays (I have over 20 that work great).<br /><br />Get the non-3D version.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Enjoyed this book even more than the first.  Day does a great job building suspension and enhancing the characters in the second installment. I wanted to read the third book as soon as I was done. This series is addictive.
B008BD9SI8|4.0|Joe has never deluded my expectancies so far and therefore no waste of money in purchasing his books, as usual characters without expectancies and through a cinical world view perform high achievements and pay the real price, no pain no gain for Joe's heroes and sometimes just pain only. This ebook was another non stop reading, almost .... :)

B004SKJTY6|1.0|Unless the movie is 5 minutes long - then this is just a clip. What a tick off. This should just be removed. If I wanted basic plot I would IMDB it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this story. I knew that the book was highly rated, but it far exceeded my expectations. The story was gripping-I couldn't help but keep reading just to figure out the mystery of the silos and see what was going to happen next. The writing is well-crafted as well. Just the right amount of detail, believable characters, powerful emotions, and perfect pacing. I highly recommend it. It's a fascinating story carefully crafted by an extremely talented writer. You won't regret buying it.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|My review is simple! If your not a Twilight fan yet you will be! Part 2 is on the way better hurry and catch up on the story!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Buying 32 blank dual-layer DVDs will cost you about the same as buying this set.<br />Now that's what I call entertainment value!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Normally I wouldn't watch a show that had the words \\"Teen\\" and \\"MTV\\" associated with it because I haven't been a teen in nearly two decades and I haven't watched MTV since they stopped airing actual music videos. But, I watched the first couple episodes of Teen Wolf on Netflix after some friends recommended it and I was hooked! I went through both seasons in about four days of marathon watching, and now I'm impatient for season three.<br /><br />You really can't compare it at all with the cult classic movie, but if you enjoy this show for what it offers -- it totally delivers! It has some sharp writing, fantastic characters and the actors are very talented. I love the romance between Allison and Scott because it really feels like a teenage relationship, albeit complicated by the whole werewolf problem. I love the supporting cast who manage to shine through even bit parts, but my favorite character by far is Stiles. Dylan O'Brien really brings him alive, and the writers have given him a lot of great material to work with. He lights up every scene he is in and totally steals the entire series for me.<br /><br />No TV show is perfect, of course, and this show does have its problems with some heavy handedness, some character portrayals and continuity issues. But, for the most part the show works on a lot of levels. I hate to compare it to any other TV show because it needs to be appreciated for what it has to offer. For instance, it's not as deep or expansive as Buffy was, but if you liked the play of relationships and characters in Buffy, I think you should give this show a shot. I'm so glad I wasn't put off by the name and gave it a try. I'm totally addicted!
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is the most intense movie I've seen in a long time. It was quickly obvious that the stars of the movie were not actors but real people showing what they do as part of their job. That made it much more intense than Avengers, Batman, Spiderman or even the Hollywood productions that try to depict battle scenes. They just fall short from the real practitioners.<br /><br />1. Thank you to all who serve to protect America. 2. Thank you to Bandito Productions for making this movie 3. Thanks to Tom Clancy for whatever part he had, even if it was just lending his name to see that the film was made.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I loved the book, but I went into the movie knowing it was nothing like the book.  I still had high hopes for the movie.  I was really shocked at just how bad this movie was.  I'm really not sure how anyone can give it more than one star.  This was just bad storytelling, bad movie making, bad acting, BAD!  I wish I could get back the two hours of my life that went into watching this garbage.
B009KY0TE4|4.0|Pick up the UK import of this. It has both the original song by Adele along with as an instrumental version.
B00914JWSW|3.0|Didn't think the selections on this looking at the total picture were that good -some were excellent, otherr just so-so.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Imagine if Mel Brooks had made a movie which combined the black hero from \\"Blazing Saddles\\", the goofy Nazis from \\"To Be or Not To Be\\", and the wacky sci-fi technology from \\"Spaceballs.\\" This is the kind of conglomerated comedy to be found in \\"Iron Sky.\\" It is a high-tech satire of World War 2 movies, also offering political satire of modern-day governments. \\"Iron Sky\\" is a unique work both in science fiction and social commentary. There are also subtle gags, such as a hilarious parody of the Hitler internet meme. Of course, the funniest political gag was to have the President of the United States in the form of a certain quitter governor, currently an unimportant news commentator. Such an image is even more chilling than Nazis on the Moon.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A really good read. Have read it twice and probably will again. Another Grisham surprise at the finish. Used the Kindle app on my tablet which was fun too.
B004SBX112|1.0|Another Back To The Future update. However, you won't be able to return to the present and regain the progress you made prior to this update. Thanks again, Amazon and Rovio, for your lack of attention to detail.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Tge only thing i found dusapointing about this book wss that the sequel isn't released yet. Good pace, well contructed story.
0525952926|5.0|John Jakes is my favorite author.  Sadly, I have finished the Kent Family Chronicles and the North and the South trilogy.  Winter of the World is wonderful! Through the lives of its characters in America, England, Russia and Germany, the novel gives a very clear explanation of the political movements that occurred before and during WW II.  What is most fascinating are the lives of the characters and how events influenced their lives during this turbulent period. The backgrounds, goals and the political ascendency of the liberal Williams family in England are one example of this.  Also, life for the von Ulrich family in Nazi Germany during Hitler's rise to power and the regime's crushing defeat reveals the horrors of the time in a way that brings them to life for the reader.  I have always been a student of history, but never have I understood what it was truly like to be a German citizen under Hitler. It's one of those books that you don't want to end. Great book!  Highly recommended!
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Amazing acting with a powerful score. This movie can easily be for everyone not just fans of sci fy and horror.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher can get into more trouble without  even trying in every book he is in.  His writer is well versed in what the army can do.  Its great fun to see him living from day to day  with no place to call his own and with only the clothes on his  back.  For some reason he is always the wanted man.  Read the book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just like Bared to you, this one kept me glued to each page.  I can hardly wait for the release of Entwined with you.  I appreciate the fact that Sylvia Day shows that it's hard work to have a relationship and that there are ups and downs, but if you love that person you will make it work no matter what you run up against.
B007EDYN36|5.0|This is a page-turner; difficult to put down.  This is a good book, with lots of stories and details.  It is a good, easy, fun, read. . .about three times longer than Ace's \\"No Regrets\\" book.  (Interesting all of these Rock Memoirs appearing now, huh?).<br /><br />Is it worth the money?  The time?  Yes and Yes.<br /><br />However, once again, we see a huge amount of mental pathology.  After reading Ace's book, and now Peter's, despite the negativism both share for Paul and Gene, neither really can see how badly they wanted to \\"make it\\" and when they did, they destroyed it by booze, drugs, and alchohol.  Gene and Paul wanted \\"it\\" more than any of them--they managed to turn Kiss into a way of making a living, building their homes, having children, and making a career out of music.  Ace, and now Peter, refuse to see it was their party life-styles that destroyed the dream of Kiss for everybody--and threatened the livlihood of Gene and Paul, too.  Sure, Kiss is still a fragment of itself.  It is half tribute band and half \\"real\\" Kiss.  We agree:  Tommy and Eric didn't pay their dues to \\"create\\" Kiss' fame and fortunte.  But Paul and Gene had no choice.  They wanted sober, clean, players.<br /><br />Now, having said that, we learn of Gene's sexual addiction, poor hygiene, outbreak of shingles, and Paul's psychological counseling.  There is alot of mental pathology when you put make-up on and \\"become\\" somebody else.  It is a true story of alternate personalities for sure.  Interesting, the make-up, as explains Criss, allowed alternate personalities to come through--for all of them.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, a good read, enjoyable; the Kindle edition is well-typed and quality display.  The print edition has many photos, too.<br /><br />In truth, after reading Ace's memoir, and now Peter's, I think Ace and Peter owe Gene and Paul a huge apology for destroying the foundation of their skills, fame, business senses of one of the best rock bands around.  Other bookshave told us that Ace and Peter didn't play on alot of the Kiss records.  Why not?  They were drunk. . .or high. . .or lazy. . .or whatever.  They blamed Gene and Paul.  But Gene and Paul aren't playing clubs and worrying about the rent.  They're making Kiss the band they always wanted:  clean, sober, and run like a business--because, frankly it is a business.  It pays their bills.  It could have paid Peter's and Ace's, too.<br /><br />Peter complains how badly he was \\"screwed-over\\" by Paul and Gene.  The lawyers took \\"his share\\", too.  But Peter does not have the introspection to see that when he filed personal bankruptcy, how many people did he cause to \\"eat it, too.\\"  He wasn't happy about bankruptcy--but with his drugs, booze, and filandering, he, too, was going to bankrupt Kiss--and Paul & Gene would have none of that!  The chapter on Gigi's sarcoma was particularly telling.  We hear more about Peter's breast cancer than her (more deadly, yes...it is) leiomyosarcoma.  Selfish.<br /><br />The book is a great tribute to the pathology and introspection of the band.  I strongly recommend this read for all Kiss fans--but, likely, it was written to help Peter pay off the IRS.  Or SOMEBODY to pay off the IRS.

B0098460O4|3.0|I greatly anticipated the arrival of Jonathan and Charlotte's first cd.  I was most distressed that nothing on the cd was indicative of the great voices that had been shown on the tv show.  While very nice, the cd lacked any punch.  The music overpowered the voices as though the cd had been produced by a non music man.  This could have been so much better.  Next cd hopefully will be better.  Hope they get a new production team.

B008Y1YKE4|4.0|There's really not too much to say about this movie. It was good, and had heart-warming moments, but wasn't great. On Christmas Eve night, Santa Claus and his elves control an ultra-high-tech sleigh called the S-1. Santa's son, Steve is up to be the new Santa next year. The other son, Arthur is an embarrassment that answers children's letters to Santa. When Gwen is forgotten, Arthur decides to take the gift to her himself. With the help of Grand-Santa and an elf that's an expert in wrapping named Bryony, they must deliver the present before dawn, or else. If you want a good heart-warming Christmas movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy ARTHUR CHRISTMAS!!!

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|THE PLOT IS O.K. WHAT REALY STOOD OUT WAS THE HIGH-TECH DIGITAL EFFECTS BOTH VISUALY & SOUND. THE ACTING WAS WELL DONE. BUT I HAVE TO SAY I WAS EXPECTING A MORE EFFECTIVE PLOT. IF ONLY THEY PUT A MORE COMPLEX PLOT, I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THE MOVIE LOTS MORE, I RATED IT A 4 STAR BECAUSE OF THE TECHNICAL THOUGHT THAT IT TOOK TO PRODUCE AND CONCIDERING THE PLOT WAS FOLLOWED EASELY BY MY 6 YEAR OLD SON, I STILL HAVE TO GIVE THE ACTORS CREDIT. I SAID THIS MAY END UP A CLASSIC ONLY BECAUSE OF THE HYPE OF THE PRE-RELEASE & THE SPECIAL EFFECTS.

1400052173|5.0|My copy of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  The book proved to be a mesmerizing story blending science, ethics and human interest.  Rebecca Skloot shows great patience in earning the trust of Henrietta Lacks' family and great respect for her subject.  She remains very non-judgemental and lets the facts speak for themselves, never condemning the people who harvested tissue samples without Lacks' permission or knowledge, never blaming anyone for Lacks' history of repeated sexually transmitted diseases, not even being harsh with the Lacks children's drug abuse or legal problems.  Skloot remains focused on her goal of tracing the story of the amazing HeLa cells and the impact they have had on medicine, bioethics and the donor's family.

B005XOPEOU|4.0|I bought this because I couldn't get the song Paradise out of my head. I still listen to that track more than the others, but I really enjoy the album. I read other reviews that critiqued the mixing and this new more electronic direction the band took with the album. In spite of them, I took a chance and bought the album. I am not disappointed with my decision. Yes, this album feels different than their older work. But...I'm growing and changing as I get older, more secure in my identity, and more comfortable with my ability to take risks. Why should I hold different expectations for one of my favorite bands? I didn't give the album 5 stars, because I'm not in love with every single song. That might change; for now, I still really like this offering. You should definitely buy this album if:<br />1.You just love Coldplay and would buy any of their stuff.<br />2.You love Chris Martin's voice,his piano, and the harmonies of the entire band.<br />3.You're curious to follow the development of the band over time.<br />4.You've been haunted by one or more of the songs on the album.<br /><br />Those were my reasons, and as I said, I wasn't disappointed.
B009XY97VC|5.0|If you are a TSFH fan you will want to buy this for sure. Tim@fastlanemovies sums up a good portion of my thoughts.

B00015N56U|5.0|The film talks about truth in our society! With the reelection of U.S president with faulty record and no achivement whatsoever - we must ask ourselves is U.S.A the only country reellecting someone who have let down a nation? Because it's not...<br /><br />The film is a great mirror to the book which I read in early 90's by Orwell and a mirror  to a society we livein now. Because the 'telescreens'  are now anywhere, and probably in form of pc and t.v...Orwell said WW II has influenced  him towrite this novel, and maybe you could see why...With  also the<br />character description of Mao, nowadays Chave and back in the 40's-Hitler. George Orwell had them inspiring him to write this novel (also because of dominant parties those leaders must uphold \\"for the benefit of many\\")which makes it very  well spoken of in intellectual circles and political parties(especially anarchists). Orwell made no love  with this world but he presented our leader-the media.  as sustainable and how it feeds our minds.<br />It''s complex film for those who haven't read the book, but it's never too late to read the novel :)<br /><br />George Orwell's life affected his way of writing 1984 and other books. He stands in the same line with Albert Camus and Aldous Huxley, for me, because the 3 have written about social reform and one novel that fits '1984' is Animal Farm too... But Orwell had a way of capturing his audience by giving real life facts and reference to a future we are now part of!<br /><br />Very recommended film, and not a DVD you can put in shelf with other DVD. you'll have to see it numerous times. You'll get much more than just a film for the dollars spent on it.

Well now it's off to goodwill to get rid of this dud.
0553386794|4.0|Yes, the books are long...very long indeed.  I am currently reading book 3, endless battles, deception, intrigue and general carnage.  Lots of people dying left and right.  The author is no respecter of persons, he is going to kill off characters large and small, whether you formed an attachment to them or not. Unfortunately, I accidentally saw some spoilers which make me unhappy, however, this is Mr. Martin's tale and not mine.  These books keep me guessing and I find that an irresistible pull - the books are dang near impossible to put down.  At the moment, I don't care how many volumes the author plans on generating to finish the story.  Should there be an end?  Love the world the author has created.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Headhunters is a Norwegian thriller that follows headhunter Roger Brown as he attempts to steal an extremely valuable painting from ex-mercenary Clas; Clas then uses his mercenary skills to hunt Roger in an epic game of cat-and-mouse. Of course, the story is a lot deeper than that, but I'd rather not spoil this excellent film.<br /><br />The story packs in plenty of thrills and twists to keep the audience at the edge of their seats and gasping in awe; the film also uses immersive dialogue to keep the audience fully engaged. There are many thrilling scenes in this film; my favorite is the sequence in the cabin where Roger must hide in an outhouse, which is packed with thrills and disgusts. (You can probably guess, but I won't spoil the reason.) The ending of the film was great and twisted. There is a lot of violence in the film and some vicious gore effects. It's beautifully shot, as well. The acting was also amazing; I haven't seen many Norwegian films so I didn't recognize most of the actors, but I plan on watching more after this phenomenal film. I also enjoyed the music.<br /><br />Overall, Headhunters is a brilliant crime thriller. It's thoroughly entertaining and captivating; I couldn't look away and refused to take any breaks. As of 11/10/12, this film is available on Netflix Steaming and Amazon Prime Instant Video, but a purchase is also highly recommended.<br /><br />This film has strong violence and gore. There are also multiple scenes of full male and female nudity, and a few sex scenes.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was written by a doctor who had a NDE and was in a comma for 7 days with only a 90% change of survival. This book should awaken the minds and hearts of the professional and scientific communities. Although this book goes into deep detail of how the brain works and how the meningitis was distroying his brain he survived and recovered 100%. There is a very real scientific challenge here and the proof of heaven is believeable. I highly recommend reading this book to those especially that only see things that can be convinced scientifically. There is a heaven.

B001JIHGO0|5.0|As a fan of action/adventure films, I truly enjoyed this movie. Anyone who likes films that include adventure, action, history, numerous characters, subplots, and some humor will no doubt enjoy Van Helsing.<br /><br />The plot is revealed summarily as this: Van Helsing must go to Transylvania and destroy Dracula, at the instigation of the Vatican in Rome. By doing so, he will aid the family of the Valerious in their entrance to Heaven. Dracula was not destroyed by any of the Valerious, so generations of them are apparently all waiting together at the Gate of St Peter. They currently are stuck there in limbo until Dracula is destroyed and the curse is lifted. There are only two of the Valerious left, so time and aggression are paramount to the mission. Van Helsing arrives to find that his work will not be so simple, as the people there have found that traditional techniques of destroying vampires does not work on the famed Dracula who, once again, is the main target. Only by a secret method, never before known and discovered by the Latin-fluent Friar Carl, will work to eliminate Dracula.<br /><br />Many classic creatures of legend occupy the screen throughout the film. Frankenstein, Igor, Dracula, Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, werewolves, vampires, and a host of wonderful medieval-like characters provide a wonderful array of interesting and thoughtful figures and personalities which many will like. The main part of the film is set in Transylvania, at the turn of the 19th century. The mise-en-scene of the film is simply fantastic, given the central subject of monster-hunting in Europe during the late Enlightenment Period. The sense of foreboding and darkness throughout the entire film is never absent. (Think of Tim Burton's 1989 \\"Batman\\" film or his 1999 \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" interpretation. It is quite the same in this film, although this work was directed by Stephen Sommers of \\"The Mummy\\" fame.) It seems that there is always danger lurking around every corner for Van Helsing and his friends. And if not at risk of being murdered by the local peasantry, then the danger comes at the expense of the fierce monsters whom he is hunting. I also loved the way that humor was mixed in with the theme of adventure, action, and monster-hunting. Hugh Jackman (Van Helsing) and David Wenham (Friar Carl; Mr Wenham was also Faramir in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" 2 and 3) are a wonderfully entertaining and comical duo, and are well-remembered long after the film. Add in the colorful and unique Kate Beckinsale, and the duo becomes an even more fun and interesting trio. The main villain of Dracula, played by Richard Boxburgh, is absolutely cool. His performance was downright awesome and memorable. He had a fun mix of anger, ambition, humor, and class. Indeed, he is quite the conflicted monster!<br /><br />Van Helsing and his friends go on monster hunts and adventures, fighting with state-of-the-art weaponry and inventive techniques for ridding the world of monsters. And the CGI is stunning and amazing, and in and of itself could make for an interesting watch. Everything about this film is excellent.<br /><br />Watch \\"Van Helsing\\" for a great time, especially around the Halloween season. Get your friends together, and hold on for a great and fun adventure!friends.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|When I first started the book, I thought how could this possibly be over 300 pages.  It seemed the author would have to do a lot of long drawn out scenarios.  I was very wrong, this book is riveting.  Once the premise is laid out, I could not put this book down.  For anyone who enjoys twists and turns and legal thrillers, this book is excellent.  Very well written, too.

Some parts drag but the characters continue their story line.  I wish it would have been more detailed about their relationship and interactions.  I feel the author tried to avoid this story to be like \\"Fifty\\" toooo hard.  I enjoyed the first and hope the next will be written in that format.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan, so when I got a ps3 that can play blurays I had to get this set. First off the box that houses the movies has a well designed and artistic look that is pleasing to the eye. Secondly it comes with all six movies and as a bonus 3 discs filled with bonus and extra content. Now for the important part the movie quality. The quality as far as picture is really good, in some areas though the quality drops mostly when there is heavy cgi like in episode 1 the cgi stands out and is noticeable. Other than that the picture quality is awesome. The audio quality is amazing in all movies. I watched using 7.1 surround sound that is what I would recommend. I would recommend this to any movie fan or collector and especially Star Wars fans that don't mind the prequels.

B0090SI42Y|4.0|Rza bit off more than he could chew.  This movie shouldn't have been written AND directed AND scored AND starring Rza.  However, the movie was still loads of fun and Rza has definitely proven that he has great cinematic vision.  Expect many filmmaking imperfections, but enjoy the fun ride.<br /><br />Thaddeus (director Rza) is a gifted blacksmith whose talents are contracted by local warring clans.  He is pure of heart and wants nothing more than to purchase the freedom of his courtesan wife Lady Silk (Jamie Chung) from the brothel madame Blossom (Lucy Liu basically reprising her Kill Bill role).<br /><br />Thaddeus becomes mixed up in a plot to steal a large shipment of gold.  The main villain is Silver Lion (Byron Mann), who betrays the Lion clan leader with the help of Bronze Lion (Cung Le; Dragon Eyes).  Zen Yi (Rick Yune; Ninja Assassin), the son of the murdered clan leader, sets out to stop Silver Lion with his armor of retractable blades.  Also in the mix is Jack Knife (Russel Crowe), the most interesting and charismatice character (outside of combat) with an interesting taste for bachelor party shenanigans (i.e., Asian call girls, liquor and opium).<br /><br />The fighting in the movie was a mixed bag that will largely disappoint martial arts movie fans.  As the oddly bewigged lion clansman, Cung Le was sadly under-utilized.  He never gets to looks good or show off.  Not even in his finale fight against Lucy Liu.  The choreography presents a mix of very cool and very silly kung fu combat maneuvers.  Sadly, by and large the action is filmed way too close-up.  For me, the combat highlights should all be credited to Bautista's Brass Body.  He seemed to have the coolest scenes, obviously the coolest F/X because of his ability, and some of the most fun choreography that was filmed so that we could actually see it.<br /><br />Despite my complaints about much of the action, the kung fu theater feel was maintained undeniably well.  Rza captured that tone perfectly.  There was also a festive display of spewy-fun gore.<br /><br />The dialogue is dreadfully dry (except for Crowe's delivery).  Rza, God bless him for trying, can't act or effectively narrate.  His character was not only understated, but lacked the lines to justify his purpose.  It seems that Rza was going for a mood-driven film with stylized combat like Bunraku or The Warrior's Way.  I could see his goal, but his meant-to-be-poetic blacksmith character was clearly the weak link in synthesizing this quasi-arthouse-ful conceptual grace.  Rza tries to use a Shaolin Temple training flashback to corroborate Thaddeus' focus and combat ability.  Still, I found him to have zero combat credibility when facing Iron Body--a character who actually earned my respect on screen.<br /><br />The score (also by Rza) was cool during the first scene (a fight scene).  But I noticed less effective use of music later in the movie.  I'm not hating, it was a neat score.  But this was disappointing as I expected to have some awesomely rap-scored fight scenes, but some of them had combat volume drowning out the music, rendering it ineffective even at times that louder music would be appropriate.<br /><br />Director Rza--of the Wu Tang Clan--was always a devout fan of Hong Kong cinema's kung fu theater.  While his direction is clearly fledgling and his scoring ability nothing to his own rapping talent, his passion for classic kung fu movies manifested the greatest strength of this film: the kung fu theater \\"feel\\" of it all.  His excellent theatrical homage includes some classic kung fu movie components such as the iron body (brass body in the movie) focus style, techniques that are named after characters (e.g., the Gemini stance), the betrayal of one's master and the revenge that follows, the house of mirrors fight (which was unfortunately brief), traps and poison darts, fighters exploding from the ground in ambush and semi-flying combat maneuvers.  Perhaps the most fun was when all of the brothel whores turn out to be ninja-savvy combat-chic assassins.  Rza also covered the bases of kung fu weaponry, including bladed fans, bladed sleeve extensions, chain-fighting, various blades and good-old kung fu.<br /><br />This movie shouldn't have been written AND directed AND scored AND starring Rza.  However, the movie was still loads of fun and Rza has definitely proven that he has great cinematic vision.  I'd like to see him collaborate with more experienced film makers before attempting another solo venture like this.  But I am so glad that I got to see it anyway, imperfections and all.  This was a good debut considering his complete lack of experience since yet more experienced hands have failed to produce such entertainment time and time again.thel whores turn out to be ninja-savvy combat-chic assassins.

B007B5EDEG|3.0|I found this unsatisfying, which is unsurprising given the series is incomplete: the author estimates there are still another two books to go.  In order to follow the story it would be handy to have a better map of Westeros and Essos - I used [...] but found no detailed map of Essos online - since the maps on the eBook version are tiny, hard to use and hard to go to (locations 5 through 9).  Clothing printed with the line \\"you know nothing, Jon Snow\\" can be found online at [...] .  Reading this requires great attention to the detailed web of interconnected relationships of a cast of hundreds of characters.  The lists of the many houses is unwieldy and inadequate, so to respect the narrative flow you are on your own working out why so-and-so behaves in a certain way towards one person whilst despising another who is closely related.  At this point I regret the five weeks of my life spent reading that I will never get back.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|well written and at time gripping story told from two points of view which cleverly fill in all background needed by reader to put together what is going on as action occurs and what took place in past.  The characters are well-developed and the historical aspects seem well researched.  A sad commentary on the US slave history
0525953728|4.0|This book reminds me very much of a mindless action movie.  The cast of characters includes the requisite macho seals, the paper-pushing bureaucrats, the hard-nosed-but-secretly-vulnerable female CIA operative, and the practical-joker with his trite and often-juvenile sense of humor.  Super-charged shoot-em-up sequences?  Check.  A plot that is big on action, but short on details?  Check.  Sex-toy and bra jokes for the pubescent boys in the audience?  Check.  Military technology for the geeks?  Check.  If it was fiction, it would be trite and dumb.  What saves the book, and makes it worth a read, is that it's not fiction...it's real...it's history...and with that come a few nods to reality.<br /><br />For one thing, these fellows (and they are *all* fellows) train, and train hard.  In my opinion, the most interesting part of the book was learning how the Seals trained for the Usama bin Laden (UbL) mission. For weeks they practiced raiding a full-scale model of the compound, preparing for contingencies, and developing back-up plans.<br /><br />For another thing, the author acknowledges several times during the book that in spite of all the training...and in spite of the supreme physical fitness and extraordinary bravery of the Seals...there is still an inevitable component of dumb luck that plays into every mission - including the UbL mission.  Upon several occasions, the author and his fellow Seals end up owing their lives to mistakes, or simple good fortune.  These doses of reality, coupled with the fact that the names in the book are the names of real, recognizable people, make the book interesting.<br /><br />I feel that a book review should focus on the book - not the author, but in my closing paragraph, I'll comment that I felt that the author took great pains not to disclose any confidential information that might compromise national security.  There's been a lot of controversy over the publication of this book, and perhaps the author has broken promises thathe made to the government and his fellow soldiers.  However reprehensible that may seem to some, he has not done any actual damage to our security.  I will also say that the author (and his fellow Seals and soldiers) are all unbelievable people - brave, fiercely loyal to one another and this country, and driven beyond belief.  I am humbled by the sacrifices they make.  On the other hand, I am unimpressed with the author's dismissive attitude towards government in general, and President Obama specifically.  He gives very little credit to the managers of the operations who made the UbL raid successful, and pouts about Obama taking some credit for the success of the mission.<br /><br />This isn't a good book per se.  But it's enjoyable, and I found it compelling.

The characters are well developed and the story is woven around the events leading up to and through WW II.  I highly recommend it and look forward to the final book of the trilogy.

0385366752|4.0|On the 5th anniversary of Nick and Amy Dunne, Amy goes missing, the house shows signs of a struggle and Nick is not being totally being dishonest with the police.  As each day passes with Amy's disappearance more and more evidence appears suggesting that Nick has killed his wife - but Nick insist he is innocent.  Written in 2 POV, Amy's through her diary and of Nick as he follows his wife's anniversary treasure hunt  - of which all have double meaning.  Gillian Flynn had written quite the psychological thriller, a story that paints quite the picture - of a toxic and dishonest marriage, a story that is full of twist and turns and at times rather disturbing.  Just when you think you have figured it out, you turn the page and hit in the face a big OMG.  While I wasn't total enamored with the ending it was certainly chilling.<br /><br />This was an audiobook and was very well done.  Amy was read by Julia Whelan who portrayed Amy as the perfect psychopath wife and Nick was read Kirby Heyborne.

B009KHDT0C|2.0|I watched this movie in Theaters when it came out because I thought it would be funny based on the trailer. Remember how the trailer had 2 or 3 jokes, so did the movie. It literally had 3 jokes. When I was watching it with friends, I fell asleep about halfway through and woke up during the scene [SPOILER ALERT] where the little girl (don't remember her name) turned into a werewolf or something. When I was watching that, I wasn't sure what was going on. Basically, this movie is a mess. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|We have a remarkable new author in Anthony Ryan.  In Raven's Shadow Book One: Blood Song, his display of well-honed prose bespeaks a prodigious talent more in line with a seasoned, best-selling author than a self-published author.  What most impresses me is the exceptional fluidity of his narrative; others have commented on this, and you really will feel the tug to read on into the wee hours, but I believe this owes more to the unique design of his narrative rather than simply a breakneck string of hooks compelling you to read on.  Instead of building the story on a series of neatly arranged chapters that march the story forward chronologically, the story is an amalgam of flashbacks, flash forwards, even dream sequences, each tied together so seamlessly as to almost appear to be one chapter.<br /><br />Far from making the narrative ponderous or confusing, this flagrant disregard for strictly chronological story-telling in fact seems to nullify time, giving the sense that the actual story takes place outside of time.  This becomes a marvelously inventive device, especially when contrasted with the point of view of a key character who happens to be a historian; obsessed with the time and place of events, he hears the story, yet clearly does not hear the whole story.  But we do, and I am amazed at how quickly the narrative voice quiets to the point where the story is no longer being told, but is found to be happening around us.  Sure, there are echoes of The Name of the Wind here, but this device has been used by many authors in the past with varying success, and, at least in the case of Rothfuss' epic, not nearly as self-consciously.  In addition, the story's flagrant disregard for time is also virulently contagious; you will find yourself flagrantly disregarding much of your own while reading this book.<br /><br />Still, there is something more that keeps you reading, as if the connective tissue within Ryan's prose is somehow stronger and more elastic than most.  I can't remember when I last read a book that so quickly and completely earned, not just my willing suspension of disbelief, but my trust.  This says a lot about the authority and maturity of the author, and I can only say this guy strikes me as the perfect poster-child for the successful, self-published author.  I believe we have a major new writer here, and I look forward to more of his work.

B00065MDS6|4.0|I had this in the late 70's  (as well as all the other KC albums up to that time), and hearing it again 30+ years later really reminds me of that time (innocence, confusion, madness, discovery all rolled into one). I'm struck with how different it is from all other KC albums, and how it is really music of such a different time and place now. What is this music even? Surely not rock n' roll, and not like anything being done today. It is lyrical, and pastoral and simultaneously haunting and edgy with no concern for commercial success. Ah, what an era that was...(yet that mix of lyrical and edgy has always been KC's domain).<br /><br />It's hard for me to compare this with other KC albums or eras (this being the apex of the first era), as it is so unlike [[ASIN:B00065MDSQ Red 30th Anniversary Edition Remastered]] or [[ASIN:B00064WSNW Discipline]] or [[ASIN:B00065MDTK Thrak]]. My personal preference is probably KC in 1974 (around when I discovered them), but there is much to like in all their recordings. But I find there is never an album that is all great ([[ASIN:B00064WSOG Usa: 30th Anniversary Edition]] and, okay, maybe Red, Discipline and Thrak excepted...), at least there are no albums that were the same. But this range and inconsistency is what I also admire and like about them. It makes it more real.<br /><br />Lizard is perhaps the most obscure recording they ever did with odd, moody lyrics (Peter Sinfield) and vocals (bassist Gordon Haskell, but also delightfully Jon Anderson on the title track), symphonic arrangements with prominent horns and piano, and throughout the unmistakeable (menacing to beatific) riffs of Fripp, and signature KC time signatures. The extended jazzy instrumental composition of the title track makes it worth having, but the whole thing is still pretty consistent in it's off-kilter sound and mood. It's an album created with disparate elements, even unwilling performers, and perhaps unrealized compositional ambition, but such is the nature of KC, creativity and art in general.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad to revisit it, and can recommend it to any fan of that era of British rock, or of creative playful music of any era in general.... For the dedicated KC fan it's not to be missed, of course.of KC, creativity and art in general.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad to revisit it, and can recommend it to any fan of that era of British rock, or of creative playful music of any era in general....

0978545095|5.0|The production qualities alone would make this the best book on Vivian Maier, but it is the insights into this reclusive artist that set it apart.  Her images, of course, are the definitive record of her interests and the log of her travels, but the authors also found people who knew her long ago when she was a child in France.  They even found some of the individuals in the United States who had Maier as their nanny.  The authors also did genealogical research to learn what they could about her family.  In years to come, as we get to see more and more of her images, our curiosity will deepen.  We wiil be grateful that Cahan and Williams have given us a head start in understanding this unique photographer, along with a selection of her stunning images.

B004HW7JH4|3.0|'Mad Men' Season Five (2012) represents the AMC period drama in steep decline, though the program is generally so much better than most scripted television today that the current season is still mildly entertaining.<br /><br />The main problem with Season Five is that  it no longer seems like a pointed and narrowly-focused window into America's recent past.<br /><br />Where the first several seasons seemed to have so much to say about late 50s and early-to-mid 60s America, with Season Five, 'Mad Men' often becomes a parody of itself; and the show almost went off the rails completely in the second season, when, in campy episode 24, 'The Jet Set' (written by creator Matthew Weiner), protagonist, anti-hero and sociopath Don Draper (Jon Hamm), while traveling to California on business, is taken up by a band of wealthy, sex-loving, and intinerant Europeans who treat him like a lesser second coming of Steve Reeves.<br /><br />Season Five is full of bad ideas, such as having the shapely and beautiful Betty Francis (January Jones), Don's ex-wife, spontaneously gaining an excessive amount of weight and attending what are often shown to be humiliating Weight Watchers classes with her fellow Westchester housewives. Though it first seems that Betty's weight gain may be due to cancer, her doctor shortly informs her that such weight gain is merely a part of \\"middle age.\\"<br /><br />The scene in which the dieting Betty walks into her dark and isolated kitchen and guzzles pressurized Ready Whip out of the can before spitting it into the sink is a conspicuous example of the sort of weak and cliched writing that rears its head throughout Season Five. The viewer can only imagine how Jones must have reacted when she first learned of the direction in which her character was being taken.<br /><br />Season Five further becomes a parody when Roger (John Slattery) and his shrewish second wife, Jane (Peyton List) take LSD with posh friends at a party. Though the two scenes involved are clever and humorous, ultimately, it is scenes like these which cheapen the show and underscore its decline.<br /><br />Another, and far more important, script flummox in Season Five is Don's unilateral firing of CFO Lane Pryce, who has embezzled a relatively small amount of money, which he intended to return to the company coffers within two weeks. Though it is indeed Don's signature Lane has forged, it is simply unbelievable, on every level, that Don would fire Lane immediately, and that Lane would not insist on a meeting of the company's partners (of which he is one). Since testicle-free company patriarch Bertram Cooper had some knowledge of the check in question, it is even more unbelievable that Don would act as he does.<br /><br />Finally, it's not credible that Lane, who is a married man and father, would commit suicide rather admit his crime and beg for the mercy of his other partners, for whom he has made great sacrifices of a financial nature in the past.<br /><br />However, 'Mad Men' Season Five proverbially 'jumps the shark' when it asks its audience to believe that liberal former copywriter and general oddball Paul Kinsey (Michael Gladis) would become a toga-wearing, shaven-headed member of the Hare Krishna movement. All of these scenes, which are badly written and executed to an almost unbelievable degree, and which also involve Kinsey's former co-worker and sometime friend Harry Crane (Rich Sommer), simply sink the season once and finally. Scenes such as these fully telescope to the audience that Weiner and company simply have nothing left to say, and are thus grasping wildly at straws.<br /><br />After the Hare Krishna scenes, we know how 'Mad Men' will eventually end: with a stoned, unshaven, and utterly dissolute Don Draper naked in a California hot tub, with long hair and a headband, mumbling 'Radar Love' under his breath. Not with a Bang, but a Whimper.<br /><br />Another pointless, daytime soap opera-like plot development: newlyweds and new parents Joan Harris (Joan Holloway) and Dr. Greg Harris (Sam Page) separate and begin divorce proceedings because Greg has decided to take a second tour of duty in Viet Nam.<br /><br />Season Five of 'Mad Men' has some good moments (such as Peter and Trudy's Saturday night dinner party and Don and Megan's Howard Johnson's adventure), but feels largely thin and flaccid as a whole. It is no longer the riveting (if highly manipulative) drama it once was.  Scenarios like that in which the mature Canadian mother of Don's third wife Megan (Jessica Pare) performs oral coitus on Roger, in semipublic and within hours of meeting him, are ludicrous.   It's as if the producers and writers simply can't think up enough degrading acts for these characters to engage in, most of whom are shown to be highly flawed and anti-Semitic, racist, sexist, sociopathic, hypersexual, adulterous, morally and ethically vacant, alcoholic, emotionally shallow, chronically dissatisfied, greedy, callow and so on. They're even litterers.<br /><br />Weiner has said the show will run seven seasons and no more, though that decision may have changed. Whether 'Mad Men' can regain its sense of purpose remains to be seen; Don certainly does some tricky maneuvering on the water skis here.an Harris (Joan Holloway) and Dr. Greg Harris (Sam Page) separate and begin divorce proceedings because Greg has decided to take a second tour of duty in Viet Nam.<br /><br />Season Five of 'Mad Men' has some good moments (such as Peter and Trudy's Saturday night dinner party and Don and Megan's Howard Johnson's adventure), but feels largely thin and flaccid as a whole.

B0096I9UTE|5.0|Kylie's \\"Abbey Road Sessions\\" presents sixteen of her hit recordings in a rearranged - restructured fashion, giving the songs a refreshingly new sound. When I first heard about this album,I thought it was going to sound like many of the other typical \\"unplugged\\" albums that are out today. However I was pleasantly suprised. This album is EXCELLENT!! All of the songs have been restructured and a variety of styles are abundant throughout this album, making the listening experience throughly engaging. Listening to this CD makes you think of being in an intimate jazz club at (perhaps) 2 am. (maybe somewhere in Paris),watching Kylie giving a mellow \\"stripped down\\" (sometimes orchestrated)performance of some of her hit records.<br /><br />The book bounded Deluxe Edition has the same number of tracks as the Standard Edition. Given the fact that the Japanese Edition of the album contains the extra bonus track \\"In My Arms\\" and the Australian Edition contains the bonus track \\"Wow\\",it would have been nice had the Deluxe Edition included BOTH of these bonus tracks on all releases around the world. (You can hear the \\"Wow\\" bonus track on Youtube. Just type in Kylie Minogue Abbey Road Sessions Bonus Track.)<br /><br />Kylie Minogue is an artist who has definitely stood the test of time. Her large output of singles, albums, and videos demonstrate that she is an \\"ever evolving artist\\" who strives to keep her fans captivated with her music.<br />Kylie's \\"Abbey Road Sessions\\" is a jem of an album, incorporating a variety of styles to 16 of her hit recordings. I heartily recommend this album for your listening pleasure.

0875428940|5.0|This has been my favorite deck since I first came across it many years ago.  I would also recommend the artist's excellent book that explains her intentions behind the images.<br /><br />The artist is a practicing Wiccan, but this is not a Wiccan theme deck, although several images are clearly influenced by that religious tradition.  The minor arcana are faithful copies of the Rider-Waite-Smith images, although far better drawn in terms of composition, coloring, and draftsmanship.  Another improvement is that the figures' facial expressions are much clearer than in the RWS; the emotional factor is more easily accessible.  Some may prefer the vagueness of the RWS faces, but I find the cards' meanings enhanced by the clear expressions.  For example, the Seven of Swords really looks like he's stealing the weapons.  The Five of Pentacles is startling in its contrast between the miserable beggars and the brightly-lit window of the building behind them.  Yet this presentation doesn't force the reader into a particular interpretation.  In the book, Wood provides examples of different interpretations of this last card:  maybe the people in the building won't let the beggars in.  Maybe it's a university, and they don't want to go in because they're not ready to learn.  The presentation allows for a variety of readings while avoiding ambiguity.<br /><br />It's in the major arcana that the artist's particular religious sensibilities are apparent.  The Magician, with his deer antler headdress, is more a Wiccan priest than simply a master of the elements or a mountebank.  This image may have been more appropriate as the Heirophant, but on that card, the artist depicts a mainstream priest more negatively.  This is a departure from convention, as the Heirophant is usually a positive card.  In this deck, it contrasts with the Magician.<br /><br />The traditional card order had Justice as number 8 and Strength as number 11.  Arthur Edward Waite changed centuries of tradition by exchanging them, inadvertently influencing the large number of decks that followed.  In [[ASIN:B007D00MOE Pictorial Key to the Tarot]], he says he made the change for his own personal reasons that could not be of interest to anyone else.  Unfortunately, because of the influence the RWS deck has had, the reasons are of interest, at least to me.  Wood offers the only explanation I have heard that makes sense.  She proposes a visual reason - the Strength card has a lemniscate over the figure's head, and since a lemniscate resembles the number 8 on its side, the card is appropriately assigned to that number.  Justice, on the other hand, depicts a balance, and since the number 11 is visually balanced, it's appropriate to that card as well.  Plus, 11 on its side is an equal sign, another symbol of justice.<br /><br />Other changes include the Hanged Man hanging of his own choice, with his leg hooked over a branch, rather than being tied to the tree.  Temperance is juggling three balls rather than pouring water from one container to another.  The Devil card lacks a Devil figure, since Wicca does not recognize the existence of the Devil.  Instead, a man and woman are desperately trying to drag a chest full of gold and jewels out of a dark tunnel, but cannot since it's chained to the wall.  Although the chains are not shown in their entirety, tracing their lines out would create an inverted pentacle.  The idea of self-imposed limitations is clearly communicated.  The other card with a hidden pentacle is the five of wands - the sticks brandished by the five figures are not touching each other, but their orientations correspond to the lines of a pentacle.<br /><br />The Judgment card shows a woman rising, phoenix-like, from a flaming cauldron, a departure from the more overtly Christian image of an angel summoning the dead from their graves.  Nevertheless, the idea is the same.<br /><br />Another departure is the Wheel of Fortune, which shows a woman in different emotional states,from ecstatic joy to profound sorrow.  The traditional image of a person bound to the wheel implies helpless subjugation to chance events.  Wood's card implies that it is not the events that are determinative, but our reaction to them.  I don't completely agree with this, and would have preferred some combination of the two.  Overall, it's the weakest card in the deck.<br /><br />The deck is the typical size; the backs show a reversible Celtic knotwork pattern in green and white.<br /><br />In the years since its original publication, this deck's popularity attests to its appeal outside the Wiccan community.  It's informed by the artist's religious beliefs without being bound by them.  It's a testament to the artist's integrity that she has not \\"updated\\" the deck to capitalize on its popularity.  Anyone interested in Tarot owes it to themselves to give this deck serious consideration.itional image of a person bound to the wheel implies helpless subjugation to chance events.

B004SBX112|3.0|Would love to know what's going on with the app. I've had all 3 seasons updates and tonight it did an &quot;update&quot; that reset the entire app to when it first rolled out.

B00919V32K|4.0|Frank Zappa's \\"The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life\\" was recorded on his last rock group tour in 1988. The '88 tour is also documented on \\"Broadway The Hard Way\\" and \\"Make A Jazz Noise Here\\", as well as a few odd tracks sprinkled throughout the \\"You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore\\" series. This release is probably the most accessible of the three, especially those who haven't completely memorized every note of Frank's monstrous catalog. This one features a few bizarre cover tunes (\\"Ring Of Fire\\", \\"Purple Haze\\", \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\") as well as a few nods to some of Zappa's better known material, like \\"Mr. Green Genes\\", \\"Who Needs The Peace Corps?\\", \\"Cosmic Debris\\", \\"Florentine Pogen\\", \\"Andy\\", \\"Inca Roads\\" and \\"Sofa\\"...ALL executed brilliantly on stage without overdubs. There is, however, a whole bunch of edits from one concert to another. If Frank liked the guitar solo from a song from one night, the first verse from a different night and another section from another night, he'd splice it all together and you wouldn't know unless you read the liner notes carefully. He may have even gotten a bit carried away with this process with the 1988 material(One song on the \\"Broadway The Hard Way\\" album is rumored to have 14 different edits). This album also rubs a particular current event (at the time) into the ground, with its' many references to the evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who was under investigation for soliciting a prostitute. \\"Penguin In Bondage\\", \\"Trouble Every Day\\" and \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bert\\" all have their lyrics changed to poke fun at Mr. Swaggart's illicit affair. For me, \\"Best Band\\" ranks high on my list of favorite live FZ albums. But now the 2012 remaster has gone back to the second album cover design. The first version had a live shot of the band in that blue bordered black square. The second had no picture. The third was the best design, which featured a cartoonish drawing by Cal Schenkel. I guess the Zappa Family Trust has new issues with Cal? They replaced his cover for \\"Does Humor Belong In Music\\" as well. If you buy this 2 CD set, you probably won't be disappointed unless you don't like Zappa's music. The band is tight, and I really adore Frank's lead guitar work on this one. Especially on \\"Heavy Duty Judy\\", the opening number.w issues with Cal? They replaced his cover for \\"Does Humor Belong In Music\\" as well.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I've read all the negative reviews concerning the G930. I can't say I've experienced any of them.<br /><br />I will address the two major issues I've come across before moving on:<br /><br />\\"White Noise\\" - Many people complain about static or white noise in the background. The only background noise I hear is while the device is connecting or if the \\"Sidetone\\" volume adjuster is too high. The Sidetone adjustment determines the amount of real-time feedback produced by the mic (also known as microphone monitoring).<br /><br />\\"Noise Cancellation\\" - Several people have moaned and groaned about the non-existent noise cancellation. I'm a heavy Team Speak user. Under their voice detection tab, there's a graph which shows mic input levels. Every headset I've owned has picked up 10-30dB of noise (background / static / mic gain). While testing the G930, the meter remains dead flat. As in, there's no heavy background noise getting picked up. The noise cancellation does exist and thus far, the microphone has proved to be better then my Turtle Beach X12's.<br /><br />The headset is fairly comfortable. I wear glasses and have larger ears. Yet, my ears fit perfectly and are completely surrounded.The sound quality isn't too shabby, although if you're a Turtle Beach fan, you'll notice that the lower frequencies are lacking. Luckily there's an equalizer included with the Logitech software.<br /><br />The range, battery life, and side buttons are great features. I especially love the red LED light located on the microphone which indicates whether or not the mic is muted. There's nothing worse then forgetting to mute your microphone, only to rip a loud one or cuss out your roommate. That little red light is amazing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good quality sound (Bass is lacking, but can be adjusted with included software)<br />Comfortable (Even with glasses and dumbo ears)<br />Price (If you nabbed it while @ $94)<br />Red LED Mic mute indicator<br />Rechargeable (I hate buying batteries)<br />Microphone Monitoring (Aka, Slidetone, can be adjusted with included software)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Auto shut-off due to inactivity (As far as I know, I can't disable this or extend the 10min window).<br /><br />I look forward to the next model.
B0000009SM|5.0|This is one Zappa album that I never get tired of. It's to the point, no filler. Lots of bang for the 43 minutes or so it takes to enjoy this. Every track is a classic in my book. There's very little, if any smut here. Those who bought this expecting explicit lyrics will find this one radio friendly (although radio was rarely ever friendly to Frank). I love FZ's '70's output the most, and this is one of the highlights of that decade.
0525953728|3.0|This is an insightful read.  I gave it to my son, husband and his friend. The feedback was mixed.  Some really liked it while others did not.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Haven't finished the book yet, but it's one of those that you just don't want to put down!  I find myself wanting to pick it up even when I should be doing other things.  A group of teachers from my school suggested it but I didn't think I'd like it, so put off getting it. I'm so glad I changed my mind!  With much of it taking place in the 1950s, it's bringing back memories...some good...some not so good.  The plot keeps you guessing and totally engaged.  Can't wait to see how it ends.  Highly recommend it.

1451695187|5.0|Years ago, when neurologists and other doctors and scientists began explaining away the NDE as a confabulation of the brain, I said to my spouse \\"I cannot wait until a neurologist has an NDE.\\"  At last, this has happened.<br /><br />I commend Dr. Alexander's bravery in telling his story in all its detail, a very difficult thing to do with an experience that is fundamentally ineffable, and while knowing that many of his colleagues would be dismissive.  I hope that Dr. Alexander's current focus will bring the synthesis of science and spirituality that he so ardently desires.<br /><br />This book is informative and uplifting, and should be in every hospice library.  Carry on, Dr. Alexander.
1609611543|5.0|It is heartening to see the publication of so many books exploding the baloney of the lipid theory and the high carb diet.  Dr Davis neatly sums most of them up for us but what a shame that most doctors will not read it.  Mine blames the obesity epidemic on gluttony!  Most of the people over 55 in this little town where I live, in South Africa, are on one statin or another and when my GP prescribed this stuff for both my wife and I some seven years ago, I decided to do some research on it before we actually started swallowing the pills.  We never did take it and proceeded to sail our catamaran on a trans world voyage.<br /><br />Now 75, I am appalled by the indiscriminate prescribing of this medicine (?) and the universal belief in the evils of saturate fats and the goodness of wholegrain breads etc.  Trying to explain to friends the folly of their ways is pointless because \\"you are not a doctor etc.\\"  Maybe not but I have been studying the subject for all those years and my wife and I are both healthy, look younger than our years  and would like to help the lumpy lot around us but it would be easier to fly with one arm!<br /><br />We have not yet completely eliminated wheat from our diet but have cut right down. We do not crave wheat products and not being able to source some of the alternatives here makes doing so really difficult.

B0002Y4TM4|4.0|This album was a landmark for this band. They produced it with an advance from fans that forwarded their money with only the promise of their names being mentioned in the original deluxe release of this album. This gave Marillion free reign over what to do with the music and how to produce the album. For years you could hear a corporate influence in their music that would try to pull them in a more commercial direction. It wasn't pervasive, but still audible at times. Here, they calculatingly took the money that fans gave them, produced a fine album and refined the music to create something that was both ethically and commercially pleasing. This album produced 2 top ten hits. No small feat considering that Marillion are not a top-forty band and never have been. I applaud them for the bravado they showed in the making of this album and the gaining of their independence.<br /><br />This album walks the line between art-rock and Britpop with grace. Most of the songs are very good. The only ones that I am not very fond of are Angelina and Fantastic Place. Those songs are not bad, they are just not as good as the others. Of the others, NEVERLAND, DON'T HURT YOURSELF (Top ten in England), INVISIBLE MAN and the MARBLES suite are all some of their best material. The MARBLES sections give the album a sense of conceptual grandeur without the album being intended as a concept piece.<br /><br />This is not the best album they've ever produced but the mentioned songs are incredible; true gems and Marillion classics. This is a great place to start a Marillion collection or to check out this Neo-prog underground legend. Highly recommended.

B009KHBDUU|3.0|I was aware of the existence of the soap opera \\"Dark Shadows\\", but didn't know much about it beyond the fact that my mother used to love to watch it. Based on the commercials I expected this to be a comedic parody of the show, but it turns out that it's not sure what it wants to be. Certainly there are funny moments, but the cast mainly plays it straight. There are multiple plot lines started, seemingly forgotten for awhile, and then brought back in at the end. In the end it's another one of those if-you-watched-the-trailer-you've-seen-the-best-bits movies. It's not a bad movie, but it's not the laugh riot the trailers would have you think either.

In fact, I laughed so much that I had forgotten that there was blood and goor at all. I don't want to spoil the movie. Tucker & Dale are just not quite what they seem. This film holds up with multiple viewings as well. You won't be disappointed.
0393061310|5.0|Our ancestral hunter-gatherers had ventured long journey in pursuit of foods. Thinking of the fact our ancestors had created languages, religions, works and laws in the process of their settlement, we are struck with awe to them. Why had certain continents succeeded in establishing civilization earlier and economically outnumbered other areas would be an ultimate question when we looked back the human history. There would be some hidden hints for sustainability of our world and important factors for our future success, which would be also applicable to the modern business world. Jared Diamond views geographical superiority helped in great degree to their dominance and displacing original species. He reinforces his thoughts with various scientific investigations such as meteorology, geography, geology, ethnology, zoology, botany, molecular biology and genetic engineering etc. His field work experience in New Guinea soundly substantiated his theory.<br /><br />A Japanese translated version of this book has been a long-seller among incoming freshmen who want to go over the subject systematically. The number of countries where world history is incorporated into a curriculum is said to be not so many. Japan is one of few countries in which high school students can study this subject. However, average Japanese students think of world history course as secondly to English and mathematics. World history means piled facts of the rise and fall of old nations for them. They are obliged to memorize important events and great persons in charge mechanically to prepare for university entrance examinations of their choice. They are not accustomed to read a book of history written with a certain concept. May be by this background, this book together with \\"a world history\\" by W.H.Mcnill have popularities among university students.<br /><br />He explains domestication and innovation spread out differently in speed between the continents of the east-west axis and the north-south axis. This explanation seems to be unique at first however quite understandable. During the evolution we surely have lost traditional knowledge about biological characteristics, distribution and potential uses and have became mere supermarket shoppers fully dependent on domesticated plants and animals. His indication of week point to men of today stirs uneasiness about our survivability in the unsecured era. The optimal fragmentation principle introduced in this book would be receptive to the business world. Industries and companies are struggling to find suitable size in organization, sales and share for the spur of the innovation. This book certainly gives us a hint for this.<br /><br />The chapter attracted my interest mostly is naturally his consideration about the origin of Japanese people. Relations with Korea, China and Russia become strained recently. As he says, if we cannot find better way to settle the territory issue, it bodes ill for the future of not only East Asia but also the whole world. The other important fact we should not forget is Japan belongs to geographically advantaged areas, though we have scarce natural resources of our needs. We should not commit ecological suicide by destroying this gift on us.This explanation seems to be unique at first however quite understandable.

B008BQL77K|5.0|I love this series. Harvey Specter is still the big shot. The hard nosed lawyer, who really has bought into the whole lifestyle of being the successful, senior partner... but he can be unpredictable. Harvey is known to be the master of the calculated risk and it's that part of his reputation that comes back to haunt him in the second series. Its part of his charm and his success and now could be part of his downfall. The clever, cunning Daniel Pearson returns to Pearson Hardman on a mission to regain control of the firm and the people that stand in his way; Jessica, Harvey and even Donna, had better watch out. Great series, I didn't think they could improve on series one, but they have.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I bought this product even though it had mixed reviews with more negative reviews than positive. It does allow you to play Kinect games closer to your TV as advertised. However, player tracking with the Zoom on your Kinect is horrendous. Putting the zoom on the Kinect made games frustrating, and navigation on the Xbox menu difficult. I tried calibrating the Kinect several times with the Zoom on the Kinect and with the Zoom off the Kinect. No matter what I tried the Kinect with the Zoom attached just wouldn't track people as well as the Kinect did without it. If you have a small area for your Kinect, do yourself a favor and buy a $6 TV mount for your Kinect. Having the Kinect on top of your TV in a smaller room will give you better much better gaming experience.

1451627297|4.0|Any of you who, like me, have been devoted fans of King's work, will enjoy this jaunt through time. I know it will be more harshly reviewed by those who appreciate King's horror fiction but for those who love his books due to their ability to transport one into a completely different world, this is a dream come true. That is what I have always enjoyed about Stephen King: his scenarios, no matter how far-fetched, come across as believable with characters to whom one can relate. I dove right in and, as with most of his other novels, was sad when I finished it. That, I suppose, is the best complement I could bestow upon an author. I think Mr. King is still not properly recognized. Which is better- reading some piece of crap that people call &#34;high literature&#34; or being completely absorbed into a book that keeps your attention as if you were watching a film. In this age of digital media with many people who cannot enjoy a book due to their incredibly short attention spans, this is literature that is easily accessible to all, and being that it is historical fiction...you just may learn something as well. Go forth and read; you will not regret it.

0451232852|4.0|Absent the inclusion of unnecessary titillating sex scenes, which often trivialized the importance of this work of historic fiction, this is a riveting tale which examines the forces leading up to World War One, including the background and often incidental reasons for each country's entrance into that war, and introduces very briefly, the beginning of Adolph Hitler's influence on Germany which is sure to be covered in book two of this series, \\"Winter of the World\\".<br />This book thoroughly highlights the often foolish reasons that politicians use to enter into conflict and examines the negative results of that stupidity on lifestyles, coupled with the more horrible waste of human life. The picture painted, of this historic time is highly descriptive and informative with the people from each country, complete with characterizations of their lifestyles and mores, defined carefully and accurately.<br />On this audio, the reader's ability with accents and tone is exceptional and each character, when speaking, is very clearly identifiable and authentic. I think, therefore, that listening to this book, rather than reading it, might be a more exciting experience. You will feel like you are hearing the people directly involved or perhaps you might even feel like a voyeur listening into their conversations and observing their experiences.<br />The thoughts and behavior of the people together with an exploration of their separate cultures, in England, Russia, France, America and Germany, are underscored and the standards that separated the classes and their values were clearly drawn and exhibited by the main characters in the way they interacted with each other. The poor, as well as the rich, had their own class system with each group victimizing the group beneath them. The wealthy exploited the poor, the aristocrats abused the commoners, the more experienced workers preyed on those with less experience. Often, victims of these times were merely chattel, property, treated as barely human and extremely dispensable. The injustices of the time were widespread and often unrestrained.<br />The women often compromised their values either to survive or because they were in love and when abused by irresponsible men, who took advantage of their neediness, ignorance and naïveté, these women were left to survive on their own, suffer the consequences of unwanted pregnancies, without help, which was almost an impossibility, and were forced to continue to live in a decadent lifestyle, perpetuating their underclass and spawning children who were doomed to an impoverished existence. The times seemed to encourage a pattern of behavior which emphasized the enjoyment and than exoneration of a pattern of illicit behavior. I wondered often if the means was used to justify the ends no matter how unjust the process.<br />The thread that runs through and connects the characters of this book is often that of those fallen women who have been taken advantage of by arrogant and selfish men who then gave little thought to their behavior and its consequences. The often incestuous way the characters connect can stretch the imagination, but it does work to sew the story into a finished product.<br />The quiet anti-Semitic attitude of the times is developed in almost subtle ways, hinting at it, so the reader is not aware of the negative images portrayed until it is upon them.<br />The book is very long, 24 segments in the audio and just under 1000 pages in the hard copy. It does require some endurance since it can get tedious.<br />The main characters come from the working poor in Wales, the aristocracy in England, the upper classes of Russia and the wealthy of America. The unexpected intersection of these character's lives and the clash of their cultures develops this story. It was definitely a time of change and great danger for the world and one is left deciding whether or not any of it was worth it. Were any of the goals they were trying to accomplish, achieved? Was the death and destruction worth the prideful need of the leaders of each country? Was anything learned from the awful experiences? One has to wonder if mankind is capable of peaceful, honest negotiation and/or unselfish participation in any event. History would suggest, perhaps not.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|Honestly, I purchased it because the movie looked interesting.  Still haven't seen the movie, but the book is excellent.  Abrupt storyline changes and an overall unpredictable pace and timbre kept me alert to the characters movements even during what may be described as slow periods in the book.  Neat overall concept too.

B0085RQLXK|2.0|Two, maybe mediocre songs on this outing. I thought, like everyone else, that the return of Jack Douglas would PUMP the boys up.  Wrong.  Either Joe or Steven really drove this disaster train off the cliff.  I can't stand to even listen to it.  It is hard to get through all 15 tracks.  Some of the best stuff is the narrator at the beginning and end of the CD. Man, I had high hopes, but what a let down.  Steven and Paul Stanley have been feuding about their relative worth as aging rock stars.  Kiss and Paul (with their Monster CD) win this round.  Don't get me started on the cartoonish like cover art.  Man, this is bad.  Gone are the brilliance of Toys in the Attic, and other works of art like Pump.  Even Just Push Play was good.  Bobo was alright, catchy tunes.  But this has no redeemable value.  I will spin it a few more times, maybe.  Then it is off to the dust bin. Save $10, skip this one.
B003ASLJO0|4.0|This movie has so many facets it is hard for me to describe.  It needs to be watched more than one time.
0316056871|5.0|I have been an amazon customer for years and have never been compelled to write a review before this one. Tina Fey does what she does best in this piece by making us laugh and reminding us to enjoy life. I bought the book and later got the audio book which I found to be even more entertaining, read by Ms. Fey herself. I have and will continue to recommend this book to family and friends a like. It's well worth the read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I pre-ordered this title when I heard it was written by a respected Neurologist who had held, previous to his own \\"Near-death experience (NDE),\\" to the standard line that consciousness is a product of brain function. When I was finally able to read it, I was happy to find, first of all, that this was written in a very non-technical accessable fashion...in fact it reads a bit like a novel, as he recounts his experience while in coma resulting from severe bacterial menengitis. Much is about the experience of his friends and family, which he obviously had to piece together after hearing their stories after his recovery. A lot of it (an almost tedious amount of it, in fact) is about how dire his situation was while in coma to demonstrate how unlikely it was that he was able to fully recover, and how unlikely, from the conventional medical point of view, he should have any conscious experience whatever while in coma. And the experience itself is quite remarkable, and fairly unique among NDE experiences; a uniqueness he addresses as attributable to his circumstances (I would tend to agree). He relates a lot of personal information about his life and how meaningful his experience has been in resolving his deep personal issues. He also reflects in various ways about the experience, as his on-going effort to process what happened to him, I think. By the end of his account, just when you think he has told all, he reveals a starling little twist that really does approach the claim of \\"proof\\" in the title.<br /><br />Now, I have been an avid follower of NDE research ever since Raymond Moody's seminal \\"Life After Life,\\" and found the account by Eben Alexander especially compelling because of his strict orientation as a scientist and neurologist. As such he was in a unique position to evaluate his experience, and came away utterly convinced that consciousness is definitely not a product of brain function, but exists independent of the brain and body; the complete opposite of whathe believed prior to his experience. Previously he believed that the death of the brain meant the end of consciousness, but his experience taught him otherwise. One thing I should point out, though, is since he was in a coma, and not in a state of clinical death, that this experience should not be described as a \\"near-death\\" experience in the classical sense. I think that the fact he was not technically dead would account for the differences between his experiece and the experiences of those who technically \\"died\\" and rescusitated (this is just my non-expert opinion, though). Nevertheless, I find his account very compelling as his brain was, although not technically dead, virtually non-functional during his experience, and so invalidates any medical explanation to account for it. And Eben Alexander is certainly a qualified expert to determine this, which seems to be in accord with his central reason for writing this account.<br /><br />I have read some criticisms where the reviewer felt Dr. Alexander did not provide enough detail about his \\"heavenly\\" experience. However, his purpose here, it seems, is not to have written a kind of travel log, or tell-all about the afterlife, but to show how and why his experience changes everything about what he formerly believed. All in all, I found this to be a very compelling read, well worth the readers time if interested in this sort of thing. Highly recommended.
B003IDMUTK|5.0|Another great book by John Grisham easy to read and kept me interested all the way through - looking forward to starting another one immediately
B008ASLK8A|5.0|As much as liked the classic series (from Grenada studios with Jeremy Brett as Holmes) the Guy Ritchie versions are cleverly concocted and quite nail biting. Even though you know what will happen at the end, still it is fascinating (to me) when it challenges your preconceived notions regarding how to reach there. The cast is stellar and the acting is tight - overall a great enjoyment!!
B007REV4T8|4.0|Some beautiful photography, good performances, and real stunts help to make this newest Bond film worth watching.  But it's not quite up to the top Bond entries because of stale and overused plot contrivances in which the otherwise interesting villian uses computers and hacking as his weapons of choice.  The best Bonds set standards rather than follows them and frankly computer hacking is lazy scriptwriting.  Still, kudos must be given to the sheer flair in which many of the sequences are delivered, particularly the scenes in Shanghai and Scotland.  There are also a number of homages to other Bond films that are fun to spot.  Recommended surely, because it's so well made, but the sum of its parts are better than the whole.
0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis was blessed to have some colorful characters as anchors to his tale. Otherwise even someone with his gifts would have had a hard time creating such an entertaining story from financial turmoil. Some understanding of finance, investments and the housing market is certainly helpful for readers, but not essential. As near-term history, the general story will be painfully familiar to many.<br /><br />The disgusting part is that what happened is even worse than I thought. I had heard Lewis in interviews and read enough articles. Even so, yikes when it is spelled out at book length. There is plenty of blame to be passed around, as well as colossal stupidity, fraud and greed. Fortunately, Lewis has some good guys to soften the blow.<br /><br />The book's modest length is appropriate as enough to digest, and without padding. He didn't need to drill into more explanations of derivatives and the markets, or his broader audience would have been at risk. An excellent read and a fast pace.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great book, any sci-fi fan will want to read.  Especially the whole setup of how soldiers are recruited and trained.  The series does start to drag a little bit later, but this first book is an easy fast read and lots of fun.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Never watch The Titanic again. Toss your copy of Pride and Prejudice.Cuz THIS is true romance--heartbreaking and sweet and beautiful and terrible and sometimes leaving you so confused and asking WHY, all mixed up into what is Wuthering Heights. It's like.....a romance but NOT a romance. Oh, I can't really explain. Just read it. It isn't flowery or fake, just....amazing. Nothing (except perhaps Gone with the Wind) can compare.
0062060562|5.0|Listened to this as an audio book.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, there are plot holes.  Also I guessed the main twist quite early.<br />BUT, but, but... the plot REALLY grabbed me.<br />It's great when you are looking forward to getting in the car to listen to the next bit!<br />Of the audiobooks I've listened to, this is the best for that to date.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Doesn't change your life or anything, but its fun and well worth the price. (free)<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I'd like to edit my initial review, this game does change your life. I have it on my kindle (thats where it started) and then on my phone for when I was on the go. Fun and challenging idle time killer. I was visiting some family, and my parents saw me playing and started taking turns. My girlfriend played it a little, and now it is on her phone too both for her use and for her niece who loves the 5x5 and 6x6 games, so now her sister has it on her phone too. Fun game and so simple (but frustrating sometimes, you sometimes need to just skip the level and come back in a different mind set)

B002R5V7MG|5.0|I bought this DVD a year ago, and have just finished listening to it for the umpteenth time.  And since I have my computer in front of me, I want to share the absolute joy and passion that Dudamel's performance on Mahler's First inspires.  The conductor, the orchestra and -- yes, them too -- the technicians/artists who made the video have done a fantastic job of bringing this epic work to life.  Have seen many performances of this symphony over the years, I can't get enough of watching this version performed -- the video work brings you absolutely up close and inside the orchestra, close witness to the consummate professionalism of all the musicians.  This is IMHO a great work of video/musical art.

0143120530|4.0|First person forays into \\"unseen\\" worlds are often a mixed bag. While David Foster Wallace was a master of participant observation in his essays, I am baffled by how Andrew Blum continues to get assignments (and now skip his essays and articles completely). When stretched to book length, these forays often fall flat, either because there is not enough material (Orchid Thief), a poorly thought out narrative arc (Psychopath Test), or some combination of the two (Tubes).<br /><br />Foer gets the balance right. In taking us deep into the world of competitive memory tests, he takes his time with the people he meets, giving us fully realized characters rather than thumbnails to admire or mock (which would probably have been easy to do with Tony Buzan). He paints clear pictures of the venues and the nature of the competition without attempting to make things more meaningful or deeper than they actually are. He gives us historical and biological anecdotes to fill out the story rather than to showcase his erudition. And his first person telling is natural and lean, without excessive musing.<br /><br />And he gives us the right amount of information about memory palaces and other mnemonic devices. Early in the book, he challenges the reader to attempt to remember a list of random items by placing them in graphic, obscene, or filthy situations in a house we know well. Weeks after reading the list, I can still remember most of it (pickled garlic, cottage cheese, salmon, six bottles of wine, three pairs of socks, a hula hoop, scuba mask, email Sandy, a Paul Newman movie, a director's chair), suggesting we all have the capacity to improve our memory. This also soften's the author's achievement of winning the American memory championship. Make no mistake, he is probably smarter than your average bear and he put in the hours. But by showing us the secrets to his success, the book grounds him and makes the story of how he did it both more accessible and more fun.
0385737955|4.0|The Maze Runner by James Dashner 4 of 5 stars<br /><br />Thomas wakes up inside a metal box moving up a shaft. He doesn't know where he is, how he got there; he doesn't remember anything but his name. When the pulley finishes pulling his box upward, he discovers he's arrived in a small community of teen boys who are just trying to survive.<br /><br />When he arrives, he learns that they are all prevented from leaving by a gigantic maze filled with hideous creatures outside of the stone walls that surround their community.<br /><br />His appearance is the beginning of the end of the small groups way of life and, as things become more and more dire, Tom is forced to come up with a plan to save them all.<br /><br />I stole the physical copy of The Maze Runner from my sister's personal library in a desperate search for something to read - and finished the book in half a day. The plot is so fast-paced and filled with suspense, there was no way I could have put it down.<br /><br />I did have some moments where the language that Tom thought in didn't sound very YA, but I guess that was because Tom was supposed to be exceptionally intelligent.<br /><br />------SPOILERS------<br /><br />First let me give a disclaimer. I'm a total wimp and a softy when it comes to tear jerking scenes. The first time I watched Bambi, I cried. And I was an adult at the time. So keep that in mind when I explain my lack of connection to the characters.<br /><br />I found it hard to connect to any of the other characters in the book. I was able to connect a little bit with Tom, but not at all with Teresa or Chucky - and I should have been able to.  I'm not certain if it was because the focus was on the action in the novel or the pace of the plot, but I still should have felt something when Chucky died. Instead, I felt - nothing. Nothing at all.<br /><br />The book was really good - the plot was enjoyable and moved along, but when I got to the end and realized there was going to be a sequel - with, most likely, the same amount of dark, dreariness that this book had - I didn't feel excited. I felt drained.<br /><br />That was just my reaction though - and says nothing for the writing in The Maze Runner. It was good. Good enough that I might read it again in a year or so if I had nothing else on my shelf.most likely, the same amount of dark, dreariness that this book had - I didn't feel excited.

On their one decent song, the volume is so compressed (all the same loudness no matter what) I have to manually turn the volume up and down to make it sound normal.

B008OJ291W|5.0|Jeff Lynne is at his vocal best, even at 63 years of age... Totally re-recorded hits from the 70's and 80's have a fresh new sound, but eerily similar.<br />If you are a fan, this is a must have!
0143119680|1.0|Interesting story but too padded out with trivialities. - I got up. I got dressed. I drank tea. I ate bacon and eggs, etc. etc. - I also found the main characters unlikable. They were both entirely self-involved, immature (despite Matthew being 1,500 years old), and lacking in any kind of insight into their own behavior. They both behaved like spoiled, self-indulged teen-agers rebelling against their unreasonable parents because they are \\"in love.\\" This doesn't make a particularly compelling story. Plus - if a man treated me like Matthew treats Diana, I would give him a swift kick in the behind, then dump him. A woman in her mid-thirties should not tolerate being treated like a 3 year old.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|Donald Fagen and his new sidekick Michael Leonhart have produced a funky jazz/pop album closer to \\"The Nightfly\\" than Donald's last two solo efforts. Leonhart plays drums under the name of Earl Cooke (with an E) Jr and bass under the a.k.a. of Harlan Post of the Boston Post family (I suppose). Bare with me for a look at the tracks:<br /><br />\\"Slinky Thing\\" always makes me chuckle and the hook is brilliant. Joe Martin on acoustic bass lays down a great funky bass line and this is a great opener.<br /><br />\\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\" is certainly the opposite of most love lost songs, no one looks at the world quite the way Donald does.<br /><br />\\"Memorabilia\\": begs the question: \\"Who the hell is Louis Dakine and what is in the front of his backroom.\\" The chorus gets a little old after awhile but the music is just pure funk jazz.<br /><br />\\"Weather In My Head\\": is one of the best songs Donald has written in a long time and guitar player Jon Herington joins the long list of great guitar solos on Fagen/Dan LP's. I've long given up on the weather in my head, its always cloudy.<br /><br />\\"The New Breed\\": is kind of \\"What a Shame About Me\\" part two. Love the organ work on this one. \\"Out of The Ghetto\\" is a cover of a Issac Hayes song from 1978, it is given a funky kind of George Duke treatment. Always good for a laugh to picture Donald with the Ghetto mama in the tune.<br /><br />\\"Miss Marlene\\" makes me ask the questions: Is there really someone named Charlie Pillow and How does Donald think of this stuff? \\"Sometimes on a league night, I catch her scent again. Her hand guiding my hand, We drop the seven-ten.\\" Would have fit right in on \\"Everything Must Go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Good Stuff\\": Love the groove on this one and the production is perfect. \\"There is a special satisfaction, When a job comes off so right, Better break out the good stuff, The boss wants to party all night\\" is classic hook.<br /><br />\\"Planet D'Rhonda\\": congratulations to Donald for still having \\"MonkeyTime\\" 24/7. The song doesn't seem to have the energy required for that task but then that's nit picking. A little less funky than the rest of the CD but the guitar work of Kurt Rosenwinkel is worth a listen, it's SMOOTH.<br /><br />Summary: Some real good songs on here and some that are not quite as good but there is nothing bad, that's for sure. The production is good but sometimes too good if that makes any sense. The fact that basically Donald and Michael played most of the instruments eliminates some of the jazz aspects and lowers it one star for me. All in all a good effort and one that I am glad to own. Give it a listen and \\"Break out the Good Stuff.\\"

B0084IG7KC|1.0|I was looking forward to getting the combo pack.  Ultra Violet is not a regular digital copy.  Even if I could get an app to place on my IPAD, IPHONE or Computer - it defeats the purpose.  You must have great internet access.  Well - my IPAD is wifi only - so when I am using it in an area without wifi, no possible way to watch that \\"digital\\" copy (there is someway to download - but if you read the fine print on their website, it is not exactly what they say it will be), I refuse to use up my data plan to stream a video I purchased for my phone, and when I visit my parents - because they live in a more rural area, they have to use a verizon data stick that does not stream well (which means that streaming videos pause and stop, as well as using up the data plan to the limit).  Stupid, stupid move.  As much as I loved this movie, I refuse to buy any video that has the Ultra Violet (which by the way for everyone who has ITunes - it does not work with it).  I am seeing this new Ultra Violet a lot now, and not at all happy with it.  Any production company that uses this instead of of a regular download or does not give a regular way to download that can play through Itunes will lose my business. (and from the comments in blogs and reviews I have seen online - you are going to be losing a lot of business).  Please create a combo pack that does not cost people money everytime they want to watch their digital copy (data plans are expensive!).

0553381687|5.0|I love fantasy, so anything that even smacks of fantasy is something I'll read. That being said, I have to say this is one of my favorites. I love the epic nature of the story and the world itself and I absolutely fell in love with the characters (who doesn't love Lord Stark?). The plot is tricky, so you have to pay attention. Even the smallest detail can come back to haunt you, if not in this book, in one of the others. But since I love complex plots, I loved this as well.<br /><br />I can only think of two things that readers could honestly object to. First, beloved characters die. Yes, they die. And they don't come back. It might be a fantasy, but they're still not coming back. Get used to it. Second, it's an epic in the true sense of the word. The story doesn't end with this book. It's not anywhere close to being wrapped up. You really have to read all the books to make sense of the convoluted plot. So if you have a short attention span, look elsewhere for your entertainment.<br /><br />If neither of these things bother you, then this is certainly a book you should read.
B007XH6BPG|1.0|Chris Squire is one of my favorite bass players.  Perhaps I set myself up for this, but this cd is a disappointment from start to finish.  There is very little of Chris, the songs are dull and uninteresting, and I could not find one song I liked even one bit.
0345803485|2.0|I originally read this book because everyone was reading it and then telling how great it was and that I absolutely should be reading it. Do I did. And I was so disappointed. How did this become a bestseller?<br /><br />Before I describe what's wrong with it, let me be clear. I like erotica. I read erotica on a fairly regular basis. Maybe not as much as I read fantasy and crime fiction, but I still read it. And this book is not a very good example of erotica in its prime.<br /><br />Let's start with my personal pet peeve: seriously bad writing. Not just a little off. The writing is bad. The dialogue is ridiculous. Definately not a quality example of literature.<br /><br />And the characters? Grey is definately not very well developed and his wealth is not adequately explained (didn't you know everyone who drops out of college goes on to make millions before they hit thirty). But I can forgive that. It's fiction, after all, and writers are certainly allowed to create fantasical characters. I can't forgive Anastasia Steele as a character. This woman who just graduated college is no more emotionally mature than a 15-year-old girl. And is anyone else bothered by how quickly she goes from blushing virgin to considering (and sort of becoming) Christian's sub? Seriously, it's ridiculous. Especially for a girl who can't seem to stop blushing.<br /><br />How about the sex scenes? We are talking about erotica, after all. Well, the first one wasn't bad. She's attracted to him, he's attracted to her. So the first sex scene of the book. It's not exactly well written, but I suppose it does the job. But the rest? Never mind. They're silly. I really expected more given what I knew of the book in advance. It was sad to be so disappointed.<br /><br />But the worst thing about the book? There really is a story that is screaming to be told. You can almost hearing it crying out as you turn the pages. But the author apparently couldn't hear it. Or mayb she elected to ignore it. Either way, it's a sad thing.

B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie is not the best movie I've ever watched, but if you're looking for something kind of fun and suspenseful without being too scary this is the movie for you. Unless you're a person who gets scared quite easily, then maybe you should think about something else... It is history with a twist, but it's not the whole story. It reminds me of a book turned into a movie, except there's no way they could put everything into the movie. I'm a bit of a history buff and I wanted to see more about before and after the Civil War. It also would have been more realistic if they'd included more about succession and the reasons behind it besides slavery but I don't think realistic was what they were shooting for. I enjoyed it enough that I would happily watch it again if the opportunity arose, but I don't know that I'll go out and purchase it anytime soon.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I believe that are very few books that touch our lives books that stay with you for the rest of your life even though it been years since book have read the book. I read the in sixth grade it opened my eyes to a new way to look at the world. This book to me shows that there is no perfect world that something is always missing and we should never let go of our emotions good and bad ones. They are what make us human. This book often comes to my mind when my life is going the way I want it to. It reminds me that that we as humans aren't perfect and we must be careful and grateful for live we live. The world is changing I am not sure where its headed bad or good but this book has given me hope and taught me to be grateful for everything.

B009NPKTN6|5.0|Absolutely hilarious! Baldwin outdid himself!! One of the most entertaining films I have ever seen!! I think they all<br />did an excellent job and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Was<br />not crazy about Baldwin until this movie came out. Did get to<br />see him in a whole new light.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is by far my favorite book of Stephen King!  Usually don't read his books more than once...this one I will!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I have used many backpacks to carry my laptop for work. This one is by far the best one I have ever owned. It has lota of compartments and my 17 inch Dell with extra large battery fits easily with room to spare.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|We needed another version and this one meet the bill. Thanks for keeping all of us entertained! Now to conquer it!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|PROMETHEUS IS A MUST SEE SCIENCE FICTION EXPERIENCE FULL OF BEAUTY ... DANGER AND QUESTIONS . THE SETS IN THIS MOVIE ARE AMAZING . THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE FLAWLESS . THE SOUND EFFECTS EDITING SHOULD WIN AN OSCAR ! THE MAIN 2 CHARACTERS ELIZABETH SHAW AND DAVID ARE UNFORGETTABLE AS ARE SOME INTENSE SCENES . I WATCH THIS MOVIE TIME AND TIME AGAIN AS I DID WITH THE FIRST 2 ALIEN MOVIES .THIS ONE IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THOSE MOVIES WHILE SHARING SOME OF THEIR DNA ... BUT AWE INSPIRING JUST THE SAME .
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|When this season began, I was a little worried. It seemed like they had packed SO much into the first season (and I honestly right up until the end had thought that they were only meaning for it to be a one-time thing!) that I really wasn't sure they were going to pull it off. The first episode or two were slower moving, but it was only to set some groundwork again to give a good base for some awesome action. Anyone who says otherwise spoke too soon! -- My sister and I live long-distance and literally call each other EVERY week to discuss it, which isn't something we would do about any other television show. It plays with your emotions! Great evening drama. (And that is what it is, an evening drama, so don't expect anything different!)
B001UW58WW|5.0|I love this cd.  I even have my third graders listening to him and they enjoy his music and always want more.
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|i like this game but i dont think its worth the price... i would suggest if its free... but since you have to pay..i do not suggest this game.. and i saw same app in the google play and it was free.. just sayin..
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Very good story about “after“. Held my attention to the end but honestly, the ending left me a little bit wanting.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|WE LOVED THIS MOVIE AND ALL OF THE BOURNE MOVIES. WE, THE PUBLIC FAMILY VIEWERS NEED MORE EXCELLENT MOVIES THAT OMIT NUDITY, SEXUAL IMORALITY, VULGER WORDS AND THE LIKE.<br /><br />WE CAN ENCOURAGE EVERYONE WE KNOW TO WATCH THIS SERIES, WITHOUT BEING EMBARRASSED BY ITS CONTENT, WHEN SOMEONE GETS OFFENDED.
1438819404|3.0|Not really what I hoped for. I was looking for one with pictures besides just their faces that you can find at any store and since it didn't show any inside pics on line I had to take a wild guess. Not really what I hoped for. Thinking I will probaby take it back to the store and hopefully trade for what I really want.
B004CA2HVE|5.0|The album was great. Anything he puts out turns to gold (or platinum depending on who you talk to). Recommend
B0053O89WY|5.0|I got the package very quickly after ordering. I enjoyed watching all my favorite episodes again without commercial interruption! Quality is great!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This phone cover cracked on the first time to put it on the cell phone.  We called LifeProof Co. and they said the serial number was a rip-off number and to only order directly from them and not from Amazon for this item.  They said they had many complaints all with the same serial number given.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I really wasn't sure that the movie would be anything like the book, but was pleasantly surprised.  It was a little short I thought and some of the subtle parts of the book were not fully developed.  I look forward to the next one.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Love the game but the ads at the beginning of each game are terrible and ruin the fun. I gave the same game from MobilityWare on my iPhone with no ads and love it. Kindle needs a pay app for this game with no ads.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Im not sure about this season yet.  But I liked that I was able to watch it through Amazon since I missed the first episode of season 2.
0446580848|5.0|John Corey meets Paul Brenner.<br />If you like witty irony, biting sarcasm and Arab racism you will enjoy Nelson DeMille's The Panther:  I do, so I did.  I must admit, in The Panther Mr. DeMille is a wee bit over the top in his satirical writing.  Still, in many respects for some of us it is most refreshing.  The truth usually is.  The plot of The Panther is the standard us versus the terrorists thriller only with a lot more background in how our anti-terrorism forces actually work.  This is not an action thriller but more of a cerebral read.  So if shoot-`em-up-bang,-bang is your cup of tea you will be let down with The Panther.  Don't get me wrong, there is definitely some very good action just not a whole lot.<br />One of the highlights of this DeMille book is the meeting of protagonists John Corey and Paul Brenner ( Up Country and The General's Daughter).  It is a match made in heaven as the two sarcastic investigators work extremely well together, each trying to outdo the other in the satirical department.  Most of the book is devoted to Yemen's people, geography and culture as Corey and Brenner hunt for the infamous American turned al Qaeda terrorist known as the Panther.  As I have been to Yemen I thoroughly enjoyed and completely agreed with Corey's assessment of Yemen.  It is a rather desolate, hard-to-take throwback to the 8th century Muslim country of dubious reputation.  Actually, Mr. DeMille did a pretty good Yemen travelogue, and I agree with his vivid descriptions:  Great place to read about, deadly place to visit.  Best seen from the aircraft's window on takeoff.<br />Excellent character development:  A DeMille trademark.  Looking forward to another John Corey-Paul Brenner novel.<br />Some graphic violence and language but all germane to the story.  No gratuitous sex.<br />I like Nelson DeMille and I particularly like his satirical writing style, so knowing that his sarcasm may turn off some readers I still must give this novel a hearty recommend at5 stars.  It is a big read (625 pages) and would be great for the holidays as a gift or a keeper.  Looking forward to seeing John Corey and/or Paul Brenner in a future DeMille novel.  Enjoy.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|i am very pleased with my purchase of downton abbey season 1 and 2 ..it came very fast and it came in perfect shape.
B006VC3LES|5.0|One of my top ten favorite films, Polanski and the spot-on cast made one for the ages with this one...and I was really knocked out at how good the new HD version looked.  Really wonderful to see a film of this age look like it was shot yesterday...<br /><br />Now I just want &#34;The Last Picture Show&#34; to get the same treatment, and I'll be happy :)
B009D8RJR2|5.0|WOW!  The Fifth Witness by Michael Connelly is about a woman on trial for murder.  She is charged with killing a man who is the head of the company that was suing to foreclose on her home.  This is a fantastic story!  I listened to the audio book and LOVED IT!  The trial was very interesting and got my attention and held it.  The ending blew me away.  You have got to read (or listen) to this--it's a must read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|so fun to play, several choices of deals to choose<br />I like the auto play, and the choice to use an auto complete feature, nice challenge game.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Just like all the other Van albums, just love it.  He is a poet that puts music to his words.  Hope he keeps making music.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This should be made in to a movie!  One of his best and one not to be able to put down until through reading!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Rating: 4.75<br /><br />Salmon Fishing In Yemen is a delightful movie.  Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt have wonderful chemistry together and Ewan is wonderful as a staid government worker caught up in his every day life and a marriage where neither party is particularly happy or appreciated.  Then along comes a sheik with an improbably idea, to build a river in Yeman where salmon could live and provide a living for his people.  The title makes this sound like a comedy but it's really more of a tale of one man coming back to life and learning to dream once more.  The cinema photography is wonderful.  I loved the scene of the Scottish Highlands.  The character of the Yemeni sheik is charismatically played by Amy Waked, a man going against the tradition of his people to find a new path for economic survival.  Emily Blunt also gives us a wonderful portrait of a woman torn between two men, her fiance at war and the repressed man she is working with.  Terrific understated performances are the measure of this movie, directed by Lasse Hallstrom.<br /><br />There is something for everyone to love here.  A very civilized and lovely romance, a movie about fly fishing and the needs of salmon to live and thrive, a bit of espionage against the project and so much more.  I think this is one you will find yourself watching over and over.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|Getting new music from Van Morrison is like a great visit from an old friend. I've listened to the album many times now and I enjoy every song. Van puts a little of his life in every song and although my life is nothing like his, I can relate to much of what he sings about. I love the sound of his music. I look forward to his next musical visit.<br /><br />Obviously I am not a music critic, so I won't even try to give you a song by song critique. I wouldn't know what to say.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008EZVNO0 Born To Sing: No Plan B]]
0099560437|5.0|This book is totally awesome.  Trust me, you'll love it.  One or two minor things bugged me a bit, but great for a first book, and still a 5+ star book.  Even my wife loved it, and she's not a sci-fi fan.
0765316994|5.0|Why are you reading a review?  Just buy the book.  Read that. It's great!<br /><br />Hmm, I couldn't just post that first line. Amazon wouldn't let me. Amazon says I have to use at least 20 words describing my experience with this item.  And repeated words don't count.<br /><br />Fine.<br /><br />If you love Star Trek, you'll like this book.  If you've enjoyed Scalzi's other books, like Old Man's War or Agent to the Stars, then you'll most likely enjoy this book.<br /><br />And if self-referential meta sort of things that are funny appeal to you, you'll like this book.<br /><br />So there.  Go get it.<br /><br />I used some words more than once.  I hope Amazon doesn't mind.
B002RZZIXK|4.0|I'm a fan of William Boyd and this book is fairly typical Boyd.  A good twist in the tale, great characterisation, and well crafted writing make this a great book to while away the hours.  Recommended.
B0086700CM|4.0|There's some minor glitches in the response time but besides that it is great. No freezing and no incessant ads.
B007T99ENE|2.0|I've read a lot of Ian McEwan - my 2 favourites being Enduring Love and Atonement.  I felt this was a bit like \\"writing by numbers\\" - it felt formulaic and a bit like he knocked it out to keep his publisher off his back.  Whilst I realise the book is set during a certain time in England when women were first entering the workforce, I really felt that the characterisation of the female characters were stereotypical, however I can also appreciate this may be to work in with the plot device.  I didn't love it and I felt like he wasn't really trying that hard.  Frankly Serena Frome is a rather annoying, underwhelming character and I could have lived without her!
B000ZECQ08|3.0|Love these Movies Ive been holding out for this Disc at a decent Price & am so glad to own it WE have a 2 year old so havent got a chance to watch it but will soon hopfully As per the Movie I think it was seriously lacking just like so many of the Movies in this Series
B009WO7NQO|1.0|What the heck Rovio?!? You started with great 99&cent; games and now, horrid $2-3 games? I mean, do you want to lose customers?
1439153663|1.0|Being unable to finish this very badly written novel I can't say much other than that the subject matter deserves to be taken seriously & should not be made into a parody by bad disjointed writing. In the hands of an accomplished writer this story could have been something to applaud. I feel sure there is a story in there somewhere; it's just buried under a burden of words that I was unable to decipher. This book is flat, emotionless & detached & most definitely not `Literature\\".<br />As a lover of Historical Fiction it was a huge disappointment.
B001L5VYFI|5.0|Wore this out on vinyl in the '70s.  Gotta love digital<br />for wear resistance or I'd wear it out again.
0307744434|1.0|Everything I wanted to say has already been said about this book, but I'm compelled to add my voice because I hate it when over-blown hype encourages people to buy rubbish.  I thought the premise of a circus that opens only at night was intriguing, but I couldn't get past 90 pages because if after that much you have no idea where the story is going it's obviously not going anywhere & is a waste of time. This book is a waste of paper.<br />Although, the cover is very imaginative, that's why I was able to give it 1 star.
0985081821|5.0|I'm always skeptical when I sit down to read another vampire/supernatural book, wondering if will it be any different from the ones I have read previously.  The Forever Girl was not only different, it was one of a kind.<br /><br />In this book you will read about familiar creatures, like Strigoi, and will be introduced to a new breed, the Cruor.  Wiccan beliefs are also included, along with some mixed breeds that make for an exciting twist.<br /><br />The Forever Girl is out of the ordinary, and I enjoyed reading it immensely.  The companion novel, Her Sweetest Downfall is also remarkable.  Should you decide to read both, which I hope you do, I must recommend, that you read Her Sweetest Downfall first.  Why?  Without revealing to much, Her Sweetest Downfall has some interesting insights and characters you need to know prior to reading The Forever Girl.  Enough said.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton has done a superb job of making The Forever Girls Series authentic, with characters that seize you from the moment of their introduction to the very last page.  I very much look forward to reading more from the series in the future, confident, each book to be even more riveting than the last.<br /><br />As always, I like to include a few of my favorite quotes from my favorite character in the book, Adrian.<br /><br />\\"You're funny when your angry.\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't test my patience.  I'm offering you an out.\\"<br /><br />\\"I was unaware the woods belonged to you alone.  Is there anywhere else I shouldn't already be when you get there, in the event you might continue with your accusations?\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't wish to be done with you.\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addicting!  It teases you by making you run out of coins and they regenerate slowly.  I find myself checking all day for coins so I can use them.  Fun!
1451627289|5.0|I got this for my father as he is a big King fan. I ended up reading half of it first. Ten I had to buy it of kindle to finish it off. Great read. One of the best time travel stories ever written.
B008VBYN80|2.0|This was a good game while i could play it wich was right after i downloaded it but when i tried to play it the next day it would'nt play
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I loved the movie. I really did. It's what made me get the book. But the book shows you how it all really went down. A fascinating insight, not just into the business of baseball and Billy Beane, but into how baseball really is run. An exciting and important read for any baseball fan.
1936891026|5.0|I find what Pressfield has to say about professionalism and resistance to be invaluable - sobering, reassuring and highly motivating. However, the War of Art is not just for creative types. The book about inner resistance, how to recognize it and how to do battle with it. It is a book for warriors, whether you are an artist, athlete, or any professional who is serious about becoming a master in your domain.<br /><br />I definitely plan to read the sequel. Thank you J Michael Dolan (the blog) for recommending Pressfield's books.
0811879631|5.0|The artists at Pixar have made so many amazing movies over the years that it is easy to forget the hundreds of artists who make millions of artworks in the process of making a film. In most cases, we would never get to see the production art for a movie, but one of the great things about Pixar is that when they put something together, they do it right. This book is no exception. If you love Pixar, you'll love this book.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This man writes like no other! His wit and humor injected into telling the story, at times, actually makes me laugh out loud. His books make me feel like I am right there listening and watching the entire story. This book also gave me great insight into the world of politics and life in the Middle East.
1848566190|5.0|More like a poster book than a great insight into his works. Oeuvre was a better book in my opinion as it showed more of the artists insights and process in making the memorable posters he is best known for. But, don't get me wrong, this is a very good book of artworks, but that is pretty much all you're getting with this one. Just the art. Which is beautiful, of course.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have always been a Grisham fan, could not wait for him to pen another book.  In my opinion, A Time To Kill will always be his best-written book, but this book comes close.  I definitely did not see the end coming, and most of the time I can tell.  This is definitely a page turning; don't want to put down book.<br /><br />Malcolm Bannister is a lawyer sent to prison for becoming innocently tangled in a money-laundering scheme.  He is sentenced to jail for ten years, where he works in the library and assists other inmates.  It is here Malcolm crosses path with an inmate who has detailed information about the death of a Federal Judge.  Malcolm will use this information to forge a plea bargain.  However, with Mr. John Grisham, all is not exactly what it seems.  The information given to the FBI by Malcolm is not true, and it will have the FBI in a tailspin.  This is where the twists and turns begin.  Mr. Grisham weaves the different characters into plot with ease.  You want to know why they are brought into the story, but you just can't seem to figure out what Malcolm's agenda is.  Keep reading it does have a very good ending. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />This book has all the Grisham trademark of the ins and outs of the courtroom.  The behind scenes deal of corrupt lawyers and judges.  The victimization of the innocent, (I want to believe Malcolm was innocent); and an ending that ties the characters together and solidify the plot.  So, if you have been a disappointed Grisham fan, pick up this book.  Curl up on your favorite chair with your favorite throw, or wherever your favorite reading place is, hang up a \\"Do Not Disturb\\" sign and lose yourself in Grisham's land! Happy reading!
B00340ESIS|5.0|Not only did this book make my own writing better, but it taught me why I don't like some movies. You know when you see a movie and you're like &#34;it's a good movie with an interesting idea but something just didn't sit right with me&#34;? This book makes you realize what wasn't sitting right. It's all about structure and pacing. This book will enlighten you in the ways of recognizing proper film structure and teaching you how to tame it for your own screenplays. Note: this is for people who want to have audiences see their films, not for Indy, hipster writers who want to make something original (unwatchable).
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!! Wish there was a fourth book. I'm looking forward to reading it again. Best read ever.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Want to show friends the best performance in the history of popular music? Just show them Queen at Live Aid. I don't care what sort of music they like, no one will live up to that set. Ever. Aside from that, I have stuck this on and watched it all the way through a couple of times since I bought it, but mostly it's great for putting on during a party. The music is great and varied. I wish I was old enough to have been there.
B000000WFF|4.0|was good, brings back memories of when the group was together and biggest thing out. love the spice girls. hope they do a reunion
0857685570|5.0|If you are trying to decide between this and any other book on Drew Struzan and his art, look no further. This is the one you want. This has the posters, the artworks, the process behind making them, and personal stories from Struzan himself. I own many books on movie poster art, and on Struzan as well, and this is the one you want.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Youversion is great. I like the different translations. It has hundreds of bible reading plans. I like having off-line versions that I can read anywhere. Some translations have Jesus words in red..
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Inspiring, spiritually uplifting, left me wanting more. Loved the way he linked conscious thought with spirituality. His story was very touching
B009329ZF2|5.0|The movie battleship is a fun, loud and fast moving action movie.  If you like science fiction, handsome heroes, seriously sexy ladies, great rock sound tracks... you will like this movie.<br /><br />As an age 'fifty plus' kid, I always enjoy seeing old guys kick butt and deliver the cool 'one liners'... this movie has a group of WW2 vets on a retired battleship showing the young Navy guys and gals how to 'get er done'.<br /><br />It's my kind of movie when a double amputee says he is about to break his steel leg off in someone's ass... too funny.<br /><br />If you are a Transformer movie fan you will love it.  However, if you thought the 'English Patient' and the 'Notebook' were the best movies ever... you will want to avoid Battleship.
B002PNF8HK|4.0|Pretty good movie based on the game. Has some similarities to the actual videogame. Although it's not really that scary.<br />I'd give it a recommendation :)
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Interesting stories chopped in half and shuffled. Makes the reader work a little. I would rather read a story straight through but this style is fashionable now. Author is good, but I think he is saving his best work for later.
B003WC5EQI|3.0|I love period pieces. I started out with high hopes based on the great reviews but I really struggled with it. The acting isn't the best. Parts of it just didn't seem realistic. Tess's whole life is just one long tragic incident after another. I hated the ending, terrible. The whole series left me feeling utterly depressed.
B000005ZFN|5.0|This is a very complex and hard to understand piece. I found it very touching at a deep emotional level. I also understand that many others do not share my opinion. It is strange and unusual even for Jethro Tull but it is also a masterpiece. There is no way for others to tell you whether you will connect to it. I refuse to insult those who do not like it because it is just a matter of taste not intelligence or sophistication. I suggest you listen to it once and then decide if you want to buy it.<br /><br />I got it decades ago because I was a Jethro Tull fan. Right then I knew this is something Recently after some 20 years I listened to it again and it hit me as hard as it did 20 years ago. I do not pretend to really understand it nor do I know if there is a single meaning to get. Maybe it is meant to stir feelings and thought within so that we reach our own meaning.<br /><br />Anyway plenty of others have given detailed description of the content. So I will suffice to say if it works for you then you will get a profound experience well worth the time. If not then you spent 45 minutes and a few dollars.

1609611543|1.0|Really disappointed in this book - it is simply a repackaging of a non carbohydrate diet - complete sham and I feel ripped off.  If you understand a no carbohydrate diet - there is nothing new in here.  I feel the author is just being cute and trying to make money on a very old idea.  It's just Aitkins with a new spin
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Fleetwood Mac, what else can I say. All their classic hits in 2 CD set. Great price & quick shipping. Altough a few songs on this master piece was originally done, pre Buckingham &Nicks, they are redone live. 3 U.K. artist & 2 American Artist playing as one. Would give it 10 stars if allowed.

0767840135|5.0|I have never seen or heard of Cirque Du Soleil before a friend at work handed me a video and said I need to watch it.  2 days later I returned the video and said I had to watch it three times because I liked it so much.  I was hooked on Cirque Du Soleil: Quidam and wanted to get a copy of my own.  Researched on computer and discovered there were more.  Within 2 weeks I have purchased and received eight of their videos and watched them all repeatedly.  Absolutely amazing to think what kind of shape a person has to be in to perform like that on cue, to music, and repeat it each performance scheduled.  Each video has left me with a good feeling afterwards.  I am told that seeing them live is something you won't forget, and well worth the money.  Reminds me of my childhood-Rough and Tumble, Inventive, and Daring.  The girl's voice in Quidam is amazing, as well as the stunts and every other bit of the performance.  Amazing, Wonderful, and Poignant are the only way to express my feelings.  Very well done!  And surprising to find out how long ago this video was released and that it was still available.  I will always treasure these videos.  If you've seen them, you know what I mean, if you haven't, you need to!
B00A2H9L2E|4.0|While overall the movie will give fans who aren't expecting much what they mostly came to see, the usual scares/gore/effects but while it revolves around the game franchise Silent Hill like with the first movie this one has at most about 20% of the story of the game itself.  While you'll have the main character Heather and a few others it deviates from the game itself for about 80% of the movie, that wouldn't be bad if the story was stronger to go along with that choice but sadly it wasn't.  It's not horrible but it does feel mostly to much like a generic horror slasher flick with no real substance, but again it feel like they made the movie to try and wrangle in the fans of the game series more then anything else.  The effects are very nice and the cast played their roles decently enough so really no complaints on that part. Still at the end if you're looking to kill time and keep the expectations low you'll be entertained by the movie but if you expect to much all you'll get is annoyed.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Excellent work by Lewis, who makes the book less about baseball and more about working smart before you work hard.

B0092MKFIY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this album. Every song had an enjoyable aspect to it. I was intrigued by the fun melodies that made you wanna dance until you ran out of breath. The first track on this album was \\"Radioactive\\" I think that was the perfect song to start out this explosive compilation of music. It got my heart pumping on the first chorus. I recommend this album to those of you who like action packed tunes with beats that are to die for.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  You can spend hours playing.  It is difficult enough that you have to think but not so hard that you give up in frustration.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and addictive for sure you will find yourself stuck in this app without a doubt lol if u want a good time waster this a must have!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i liked it. its good for passing time but you run out of coins fast! you have to sell you prides in order to get more
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love things that are easy. Twitter is very easy to use and this app makes it a one step process.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|As a foundation book for a trilogy this was a good down payment. I bought the Kindle edition and am glad I did.<br /><br />It turned out I had bought the book earlier and then when I realized I had bought it a second time I looked for a way to get a refund but there was no mechanism. So I have double the pleasure of ownership.<br /><br />Then I realized I have an archive full of Kindle books and would like to share them with friends but I need to research how to do that.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, but at the same time it left a lot of<br /> questions unanswered.  One hopes they will be addressed in the sequel (they left it<br /> wide open for on or more.  It was really great in IMAX, and still very good on a regular screen.  I got the d/l from apple when it was available and watched it a few times on my home tv from my laptop before it came out on DVD.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Excellent for young adults.Really entertaining & easy reading. If you have ever been in love, it is easy to identify with the situations and feelings the characters confront.  The author has the ability of making you feel what the characters are feeling. I would have preferred  a slightly different ending, but  I am sure you won't be dissapointed if you like romantic novels.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Well twenty words are required.  It was a great movie.  A little slow moving but very good altogether.  I saw it a couple times in the theater and have watched at least 10 times at home.
1439152802|3.0|Kate Morton always tells a well-written, interesting story, weaving the past with the present. But, in The Secret Keeper it took an incredibly long time for the reader to become fully engaged. In fact, I had to read more than half of the book before the novel became so engrossing that I could not put it down. It was obviously well-researched, but at times, the story was difficult to return to because it went into excruciating detail for far too long. The failure to edit, stunted the character development and interfered with the reader's intimate connection with the story and the characters. The ending, however, was brilliant.<br /><br />I am a fan of Kate Morton. She is one of my favorite authors and never ceases to amaze me with the intricate tales that she creates and shares. I will read anything that she writes. For a real treat, pick up a copy of Forgotten Garden.
0525953728|4.0|Interesting book.  A few things questionable.  The things that I am sure raised eyebrows among members of the general public is shooting people when they were asleep in earlier raids and shooting OBL when he was unarmed and wounded.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I used to work in NYC at ground zero, and I am very glad they shot the bastard.  But earlier chapters talk about how they were frustrated that they would go on raids and capture people and they would get released.  So then they started going on raids and if the people were sleeping and there was a gun in the room, they would consider them armed and dangerous and shoot them in their sleep.  Granted these guys were almost certainly bad guys, but it seems un-American to shoot people in their sleep.
B004SBX112|1.0|so I was almost done and I updated it a day ago and it took away two seasons and deleted my progress so now there is four worlds and no progress
B008OOYALE|4.0|this is a great game. only complain is the economy is a little ridiculous. takes ten thousand coins to clear a tree? some dragons afe super expensive too. fun to play though.
B003MC5N28|3.0|Lately, I've been reading best sellers from the past and that's why I read \\"The Giver\\".  I wasn't crazy about it.  It left out too many details (didn't explain how it all came to be, for example).  I'm finding that just because books make the best seller list, doesn't mean they're very good.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I learned Chess in August this year and I played this app on my sisters kindle. Now I got my own kindle and this app is great.

B007QUUIEA|5.0|This book has open my eyes to a completely new way of looking at the world, and society in general. I would recommend it to anyone, especially teenagers who are struggling to find a place for themselves.
B009VB97EY|4.0|This movie was smart, funny, sophisticated and geared towards men AND women alike. It was well written, directed and the cast was the perfect combination. I would recommend this movie to all over the age of 17 years of age.

B009HV2JT8|5.0|I really loved this movie. It was unique and original apart from other vampire films out there. I disagree with the critics who didn't give this film a better rating. The special effects were cool and I really love period films. Watch it, you'll love it!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Guess I've finally grown weary of John Corey's banter. Makes it a bit difficult to enjoy the story. Just sayin'.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I have to say that I LOVED this movie.  Its definitely going to become a Christmas Classic in my house right alongside \\"Home Alone\\" 1 & 2, \\"Eloise at Christmastime\\" and \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\\"<br /><br />This movie mixes magic with technology, showing how Santa has had to evolve with the generations to keep up with a growing society.  It answers all those questions kids ask like \\"How can he visit every house around the world in one night?\\"<br /><br />Loved it!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|My early assessment was that this was a silly book.  I suffer from a compulsive disorder that mandates that I must finish any book I start.  This explains why I read enough to conclude that it is not a silly book, it is in fact a rather charming book that isn't for everybody, or more specifically, not for every age group.  Were I between ages 16-20 I'd probably have given it five stars.  Were I between 20 and 25, four stars.  Older than 30?  There are more rewarding  books you should be reading.  If I owned a book store this book would probably be on the Young Adult shelf.
B00846REIS|1.0|I bought this kindle book because I just finished 50 Shades of Grey, loved it,  and was hoping for something similar. we I defiantly got something similar. The book really didn't have any worthy differences in the story line. When you read all the reviews pay attention to the ones that say this book is basically plagiarism. I was let down. I kept reading thinking the story would improve or some twist would happen... nope. I don't think the characters are even developed well. Basically they are two messed up people who are hot for each other from day one and have a lot of sex. Doesn't go must deeper than that. I wouldn't suggest waiting the 9.99 on it. I would much rather just read all of the 50 shades books again.  I didn't really enjoy reading the book. It didn't seem to flow well and there wasn't a whole lot going on...
B000ERU6EE|5.0|Forget the \\"black metal\\" of the mall crowd. REMEMBER one of the gods of true black metal: Mayhem. This album is raw yet melodic, dark and atmospheric. If you are a long time fan of original black metal or want to explore the past, then De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is mandatory.
0345505387|1.0|This purchase was my fault. I did see the word &#34;graphic&#34; novel, but didn't really stop to think that meant comic book. Just not my taste. I recycled it sonit wasn't a complete waste!
B00004TH83|5.0|I bought this CD because of Adagio.  However, I was extremely happy to find a good variety of styles. The drama of Agagio. The ballads. One song that has a slight country twist. A dance song.<br /><br />Some of my favorites (in order):<br />Agagio<br />You're Not From Here<br />Broken Vow<br />I Will Love Again (dance)<br /><br />I know others have said she sounds like Celine Dion. Maybe a small bit, however, she does have her own voice and I really enjoy her more than Celine.
1612183956|3.0|First, it was a pretty entertaining read.  However, about a fifth of the way into the novel, I started to have a sense of deja vu.  I couldn't quite place it though, so I kept reading. About a third of the way through, it hit me - this is a remake of \\"The Prisoner\\".  If you combine the British \\"The Prisoner\\" TV series with the 2009 American miniseries remake of \\"The Prisoner\\", you can account for about 80 to 85% of the plot.  But with more butt-kicking and action scenes since the British secret agent in the 1960s version has been replaced with an American federal agent along the lines of an Ethan Hunt or Jason Bourne.<br /><br />However, I found the explanation in the novel to be more satisfying than the one given in the 2009 miniseries. The decision he made at the end actually makes sense in the world context of the novel compared to when he makes the same decision in the 2009 miniseries (Yes, the stories are THAT similar).<br /><br />I kept waiting for giant inflated ball thing to make an appearance, but it didn't.
B004SBX112|3.0|i just did an update for seasons and it wiped all my episodes out i now only have the original episodes fix and i will give u a 5 star rating

B00005N6KG|5.0|I've used this type of headphones for at least 3 years now, and I love them!  I have small ears, so earbud headphones  hurt my ears.  These earphones go in the ears, but are not too large.  As other reviews mention, I did have a pair go bad on me, this was after maybe a year of use.  I mainly wear these while exercising.  I made sure to order 3 pairs of these after my first pair went out, I want to have backups on hand.  Really great headphones for the price.
B002ZG97LK|3.0|I liked the first one the best. Enjoyed seeing julianne in this one. Not a bad movie but needed a little more of something.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everyone was talking about this book so I had to read it for myself.  I am glad i did.  Couldn;t put it down.  Sexual scenes were outrageous.  You never forget your first love and she couldn't.  She was perfect for him  New to love and he taught her everything.  I had to finish the series and I just wish there was more of Grey to read.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|I am usually a gmail person but I had this legacy hotmail account that I use as a back up to my normal email application.

So far so good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading 50 shades grey, I wanted to see what would happen between the two.  Finished boo within one day.  I skippe over many sexual parts in the book. Didn't interest me.  I like Grey  I knew there was more to him than just sexuall domination.  I knew he loved her by the way he treated her.  She rocked.  She looked beyond the wealth and saw the man.  She didn't forget her morals and he couldnt push her around no matter how much she loved him

B000GBEWHA|5.0|I bought this to review because my niece and nephew had the leads in their school play so I wanted to be up on the rolls.<br />I would definetly recommend watching this one!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I made it 4 stars because I don't like angry birds as much as my sisters. Our whole family loves Star wars we own all the movies and if you love star wars GET IT! its worth the money great gameplay and graphics and the birds are so cute! and Luke skywalker even has a lightsaber after a few levels. so get it please its worth the money.
B009439HEY|5.0|How good were GENESIS indeedy..and not surprising Hackets best release.full marks to his choice of material and full marks to the guests that do this justice.That 70s period of genesis was so fresh and unique.Prog fans are familiar with these classics but i worry that some wouldve been turned off by the 80s phil collins led era and perhaps missed this marvellous period of the prog genre.i miss genesis everyday.

B001G5ZNDM|3.0|The Vinyl + CD may at first appear to be a rather good deal, but unfortunately, after purchasing both \\"Maiden Voyage\\" by Herbie Hancock and Art Blakey's \\"Moanin,\\" (both in this format) I have found the vinyl quality for both rather unsatisfactory. Blue Note Records is a subsidiary of Capitol Records, and I have encountered similar problems with Capitol's other new releases of older albums. The new albums come with small scratches on them, smears, and there is generally too much popping noise while listening to these newer pressings. Additionally, I have had similar experiences with some of Columbia's newer pressings like Miles Davis' \\"Bitches Brew\\" and even a few Impulse records, although not quite as many bad records as Capitol's vinyls. I would therefore recommend buying just the CD, and look for older pressings of these fine albums either from the Amazon market place, Discogs, or retail record stores that specialize in used records.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I loved this comics. Even though its only the first comic I plan to continue and read them all. It's completely different from the Mac tv series but good if now better love it.

I have to force close.<br />Amazon needs to work on bug fixes or show how to roll back update so I can have a working app again.<br />I used to buy a lot of books thru kindle, but will not buy any more until this is fixed since I can't read them anyway.<br /><br />Come on Amazon, fix this so I can read what I've already paid for!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the bomb!

B009OYSFDM|4.0|When this was announced, I was expecting it to be, at best, terrible.  So far I have been pleasently surprised at both the scripts, and the acting.  The storyline so far has been interesting, and I like the way that they are slowly revealing his origin story week to week, and not all at once in the first episode or two.  It is too early in the series to say this is a great series, but so far it is well worth the time spent watching.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is awsome. Some of the levels are hard. You just have to use your head to think before you build. I love it!
B009SQRL4U|2.0|If you're looking for a good, joyful, touching movie, something that you can sit all the way from the beginning to the end (like The Polar Express), DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!! This one does not bring anything special or new or fun or mysterious or exciting like in many previous one. Moreover, the plot is loose, simple and even absurd.(so absurd that even my 8-year-old sister cried to leave the cinema) It's about the adventure to deliver a gift to a girl, the only one that the delivery system missed. But the adventure was so predictable and boring. I couldn't figure out why the director not think of anything more creative or interesting for the adventure. The plot also ruins the image of Santa Claus by portraying the fight for power in the Santa family. In addition to such bad plot, the expressions of characters are boring. It's like we have seen it a million times before. The same old song. I really hate the main character, quite clumsy and stupid. Maybe my most favorite character is the Grand Santa, who had a Gollum-like look and some fun quotes. But all in all, the characters also have nothing special. If you compare this one to other previous Xmas movies (like the Polar Express, the Christmas Carols), you'll find great differences in every aspect. Or in other words, it can't be compared to the masterpiece Polar Express. I went to the cinema happy and excited, I left the cinema totally disappointed.

B007REV4T8|4.0|Skyfall is the 23rd film in the series which also marks the 50th anniversary of the longest running franchise in cinematic history.  Starring Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Albert Finney, this one brings us full circle on the spy we know so much yet so little about.<br /><br />On the trail of a stolen hard drive containing the rosters of every known undercover and covert NATO operative embedded around the world, Bond and a new agent- Eve- pursue the thief.  In the process Bond is wounded and presumed dead.  Taking advantage of the opportunity, Bond quietly disappears (and they never explain how he survived, btw), only to return when learning of a terrorist attack on MI6 headquarters.  Like any good spy, M is haunted by her past; someone who both knows her secrets and how MI6 operates is determined to make her pay for her sins.  But after so much wear and tear- physically and emotionally- is our man still up to the job?<br /><br />The backdrop to all this poses questions about the viability and consequences of lone agents operating in the field in today's political climate- the very environment which gives rise to both the villain's and Bond's own story arcs.  These two share a bond only someone in their position can ever understand.  It's good to see the angst from the books making its way into the movies.<br /><br />Many previously unexplored elements of the Bond universe are touched upon here; best of all is a revealing glimpse into his past- which is where the film gets its name from.  The word association scene from the teaser is a good piece of storytelling via foreshadowing, its meaning becoming clear in the movie's final act.<br /><br />At over two hours long it definitely could've used some trimming, but hey- it's Bond.  Skyfall's script is clever, its dialogue witty, its scenery elegant, its action brutal and its angst relevant to the characters and these modern times.  And there are several nods to the past that'll definitely make you smile: can you say Ejector Seat?  I knew that you could.<br /><br />Without giving it all away, this is the film that officially and completely reboots the franchise.  If you're one of those who thought certain elements were missing from the first two Daniel Craig films, your faith will be restored with this one.  Even the opening sequence is a gorgeous return to form, definitely invoking the classic styles of the late Maurice Binder.<br /><br />As a lifelong James Bond fan, Skyfall makes a welcome addition to the franchise.  Old friends, new faces, different challenges, same old James.  Who can ask for more?l definitely make you smile: can you say Ejector Seat?

1616614609|4.0|Netrunner is a card game for 2 people. It plays in an asymmetrical manner, meaning each person plays a different way with slightly different rules and effects depending on if they are the corporation or the runner.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the corporation builds itself up by placing agendas on the field as servers, and guarding the servers with ice (defensive firewalls) until they can score that agenda. Runners build up their power, and make runs (or attack) the corporations servers, trying to steal agendas to score. On the surface it seems like a simple concept, but after playing a few games you realize that there is more strategy involved than you initially expected; I imagine that people who rate this game poorly haven't played enough to realize this, and chalk it up to being a luck based game. While I concede that any card game has a bit of luck involved in what you're dealt, I compare this to something like Magic The Gathering. Ever wonder why it's the same group of people who sit at the finals each year? As with this game, there's a lot of strategy in being able to play the hand you're dealt.<br /><br />The game recommends playing your first several games with 2 specific decks. And while I'm sure that they are balanced to play well together, and cover many situations, I found that overall the corporation didn't feel as powerful as the runner. It always felt like the corporation was on defense, and the runner was in control of the game. Even on games where the corporation won, it was due more to the runner making a mistake, then on any active part of the corporation player. The game is also heavily skewed to having a good opening hand. As the corporation, if you don't start with any ice, the runner can almost immediately make runs against your hand or your deck. In one game, I had scored more than half the points needed to win by the end of my 3rd turn. Likewise, if the runner doesn't draw any programs, they will be unable to break through the simplest of ice programs the corporation has to defend itself. The rules state that each player may take 1 mulligan (or redraw), but then must keep the hand they have, but I'm not sure that incorporating a house rule similar to other card games(where you can mulligan any number of times, keeping 1 less card in hand each time you do) wouldn't be more fair to balance out potential poor starting hands.<br /><br />During my first few games with my brother-in-law, we had to Google the effects of several cards, as their text wasn't clear or easily understood. Add to that the sheer number of keywords and abilities available, and it can make for a very steep learning curve. You *will* be making extensive use of the 36 page rulebook during your first several games.<br /><br />The physical quality of the game pieces is good, but like any card based game (Dominion, 7 Wonders, etc) if you play often you will want to invest in some card sleeves to protect the game. Fantasy Flight makes sleeves that fit this perfectly ([[ASIN:1589945158 Clear Sleeves: Standard Card Game Pack]]), and you will need 6 of the \\"grey\\" or \\"standard\\" sleeves to fully sleeve up the starting decks (2.5\\" X 3.5\\"). And while the base game comes with everything that 2 people need to play (3 runner decks, 4 corporation decks, and many neutral cards for both sides), Fantasy Flight Games will be releasing monthly update packs that will add to the scope and depth of the game.programs the corporation has to defend itself.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Engaging fast paced tale of an African American lawyer unjustly caught up in an overzealous prosecutorial sweep.  He uses his legal savvy and charm to outsmart a biased and corrupt system engineering a just outcome for his own case as well setting a trap for perpetrators in a murderer investigation gone awry. It is hard to put down. Heartily recommended.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season 2 is good. It's twisted and creepy. So far, it's not as good as season 1, but if you liked season 1 you'll like season 2. It's interesting how they completely moved away from the house. I thought the house would be the constant. Once again, the sets are amazing, the make-up is amazing and the story sucks you in. Highly recommend.
B001DHE9KG|4.0|I quite enjoyed this production of La Boheme.  It was lavish and even a bit over the top - which only adds to the drama and the glorious music.  No, it's not as good as being there in person.  But it is plenty good enough to keep me happy until I can get to another live performance.  The parts of Rudulpho and Mimi were very well done, as was Musetta.  The quality of the recording is significantly better than some of the other operas I have on DVD.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really have enjoyed a return to Grisham books after a short time away and this was no exception.  It was more of an escape than recent ones,like The Confession and The Innocent Man, but being so made it an easy, fast read.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I have barely started this book (maybe 100 pages read) but so far it doesn't come up to other books written by N.Demille. Hope it picks up because right now it is boring.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I like this Kindle Fire Case.  I like the elastic strap that holds the case closed.  I also like the way you can stand it up.  I have only had this for a little over a month but the case seems to be durable and I think it will hold up well.  It holds the Kindle Fire securely.  The only draw back is that I wish there was a pocket where you could store ear buds or some other small things. However I am well pleased with it.
