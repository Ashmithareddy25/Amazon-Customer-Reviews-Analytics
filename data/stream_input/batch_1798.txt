B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the middle book of the Hunger Games.  I honestly didn't think I would like the Hunger Games series, but I found the characters so likable and especially Gale and Peeta.  These were fast reads and I couldn't wait to get to the last book.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Awesome---whenever I need to unwind and laugh a lot, Modern Family is right there!!  The episodes just keep getting better!
B006671NPM|5.0|I dreamt about a scene in this movie (Harry's body being carried back to the school). The movie outdid my dream.<br />And the 3D effects are not intrusive in home video (Epson Pro-Cinema 6010)- and I thought the 3D in the theater WAS intrusive.<br />Very satisfying conclusion to the series.<br />Except for that one scene...(fill in YOUR favorite scene to hate) this has been a wonderful collection of films<br />Thank you everyone!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child's character is a big guy who cares about small stuff and is willing to help the underdog. He has the same investigative skills as Arkady Renko-Martin Cruz Smith's soulful detective and maybe even Harry Bosch. They all set it right for others and often at the expense of their own hearts. Reacher is a wanderer with one set of clothes and a bus ticket. As an ex-military policeman, he's seen it all except for the next adventure! There are 16 Reacher novels! That's good news!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent book, I read this with a book club and it was a hit with everyone.  The suspense was good and I didn't suspect the ending until late in the book.
B008VBYN80|5.0|wow this is a cool game!!!! I love the fighting part the best at least you are still able to see your men fight.
B005GSVFBE|5.0|Wow...it really works in 3D...and the guys who did it still seem like a nice bunch of people. The supplements are very interesting fleshing out things I had heard about early &#34;problems&#34; with Disney.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this and would tell any boy, ages 12-50 to read it! It was such an original, un-putdownable, boy adventure. The pictures were possitively creepy, and just perfect! It was one of those things where, as a writer, I was slapping my forehead thinking, 'why couldn't I have thought of this?' It's brilliant!<br /><br />Some women may not like a male pov--but me personally, as long as it's well written and fast paced, I'm happy. This story was those things, and the voice--oh how great!! At one point I had to google the author. I was dying to know if it was a male who wrote this male pov, or if it was a female who'd absolutely perfected the male thoughts. And it was a guy! Ha.<br /><br />Go, read it. Now.
1582701709|5.0|This book is really terrific and  makes a great gift to those seeking fulfillment in their lives.  I highly recommended this book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun! i have to plan it out but my 5yr old grandson does it right almost the first time  great brain teaser.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Enjoyed this one. I think they ask for too many app permissions. Are they really all necessary? Otherwise played well.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I think I was the last person on earth to read these books. So it will come as no surprise that I loved them.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This app makes it possible to search your Kindle Fire HD for files in an easy and efficient manner. It allowed me to download, and find, files to fix the lack of a flash plugin for the HD.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was good.. but not as great as I thought it would be like... should also be much much longer
B0098VXBIA|2.0|It had a few slow spots and some over the top bad acting . My time would have been better spent watching the weather channel.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I loved the sci-fi elements in this story. And truth be told, I thought this would be more predictable, since I do know the Cinderella story, but there was nothing predictable about this story--at all!! There were a few of the original elements that were twisted into something fun and new. And so, when I came to those parts, it was neat to see the way the writer changed it up. But I'd say 95% of this story is completely original so I never knew what was going to happen! It was so refreshing.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next one!!
6304143184|5.0|Classic and wonderful piece of Sci Fi film.  Am glad to have it in my<br />personal library of films and recommend to everyone.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|Eclectic comedy, Jack Nicholson is just a classic.  This movie is one funny scene after another, it kept me laughing all the way through it!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|the movie was adorable and quirky if a bit predictable but I think it would have been more enjoyable if I had been able to watch it all in one go. It stuttered, backed up stopped for ten minutes and came back on after a low quality loading bar and then near the end just sat there frozen for a minute before starting again at a point ten minutes prior to where it had frozen up. Streaming movies have been out a long time guys, it shouldn't be that bad.

B0053TMP24|5.0|Very cool book. Lots of humor. Lots of action.<br />Classic rick riordan book. I would reccomend this book to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The majority of the criticism for this book is for the assumption that it is poorly written. Honestly, just read it to enjoy. Don't tear it apart literally or scan it for errors in syntax. Simply put, the book is just something to read that may spark the imagination or give you an activity to look forward to after an otherwise hectic day. Try not to be so critical. Sure if the precision writers who are giving the negative critique were the authors, then fine in that situation expect something superbly written, and hopefully without a single error, corny or dull moment. But for those of us who can use our imagination, the shortcomings of this book definitely don't outweigh the overall gist and captivation of the love story.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lots of twists and turns and I liked the way the book was wrote. Different than most. It's worth  the read and I would recommend it.
B009F1ZYQK|2.0|I really don't know the reason why Iron Maiden decided releasing all their vinyl albums in picture disc, but I'm sure it is a bad choice.<br /><br />The sound quality of all picture discs is very, very low. They should read these comments here at Amazon and change their minds replacing this concept to black vinyl 180g that is the best audio medium in the world. Black vinyl 180g, or  coloured ones, even transparent ones, are incomparable in reproducing audio information. Until there, I decided not buying this picture disc edition.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Great shipping and loved that I could watch it online while it arrived! I love this movie and now I can finally watch whenever

B007J4T2G8|5.0|These were the funniest books ever.  No one talks like that and depending what state you are in, if found out you just might land in jail with a label.  I found these books a page turner and quite entertaining.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|My husband has a huge collection of records and has been begging for a turntable for the past two years. I checked around online and this was the best that I was able to afford and I tell you it's been great.
0786962984|4.0|I also played the old '80s version, and this is a good rendition of it. It's just as fun for two players as it is for more, and it is super-simple to learn. The build quality is mostly good, but the individual player tokens and the cards are a little sub-par. That said, the price is low, and the build quality of the board and the rest of the tokens are great - what you might expect from your average Eurogame. Also, the play (for two players, anyway) is quite quick, so it's easy to play when you don't want to get heavily involved. Our first 2-player game was roughly 30-45 minutes, and we've had games as little as 15-20 minutes.<br /><br />Taking the above at face value, however, the rules could use some more clarity.  There are some situations that are simply missing from the rules, perhaps requiring a little errata.  For example, there is a card called Crystal Ball that allows you to peek into a room in advance to see what monster and treasure are there, at the cost of not moving that turn.  If you're a Wizard, you need to return to the Great Hall occasionally in order to recharge your spells, waiting one turn without moving each time.  Technically, you could \\"not move or attack\\" by recharging your spells, thus also peeking into a room for each spell you recharge.  The rules do not state that this isn't okay, but is this an accidental omission or an intentional decision?  This means that the Wizard could spend a few turns wandering around and attacking, then teleport back to the Great Hall and sit there recharging spells while also plotting and planning their next few moves, knowing exactly which rooms to go and attack, clear them out, then teleport back to the Great Hall and repeat.  One might argue that this also means that you are giving other players time to catch up... but that's already present in the Wizard's normal recharge process, so that doesn't change.<br /><br />Another rule requiring a little clarity is the Teleport spell for Wizards.  (It seems that most of the confusion is around Wizards, doesn't it?)  Teleport states that you can move instantly from one chamber (that's \\"chamber\\", not \\"room\\", and this matters) to another chamber instantly... so long as the destination chamber is in the same Level or on a Level next to the current chamber.  However, the Great Hall is a chamber that is technically next to Level 6.  It seems a little too easy to simply pop back and forth between the Great Hall and Level 6... but the rules seem to indicate that this is okay.<br /><br />One other rule (again about Wizards!) is that you can seemingly stand just outside a room, fire a spell into that room, and risk nothing because the monster won't chase you or leave the room.  This mechanic seems very unbelievable (setting aside the fantasy aspect of the game, of course), as any sentient creature that can see someone shooting a fireball at it is going to want to do something about it.  (Especially, say, an Evil Wizard?)  But no, the rules say you are somehow safe by standing outside the room, so plink away, cowardly Wizard!<br /><br />To sum up, it's a fun game, great for young or old, new players of fantasy boardgames or seasoned players looking for a little mindless hack'n slash, and is decent build quality.  The rules are generally easy to follow, but could use a little clarity here and there, costing this review one star.  I'll change the rating to five stars if Wizards of the Coast publishes some errata to update these points.<br /><br />One thing Wizards has also done is release some variant rules that add value to the game, such as the ability to roll dice instead of just moving 5 spaces each turn (which can become tedious) or a cooperative play option.  Those rules may be found here: [...]ost of the confusion is around Wizards, doesn't it?)

B009439HEY|4.0|Although the music is superb and I am a huge Genesis and Hackett fan who ever was the amateur who tracked this CD set should be FIRED !<br /><br />clearly after all the love and care that went into recording these treasured songs someone didn't even have the courtesy to LISTEN to it on CD before they released it....<br /><br />Huge gaps in 3 spots....just terrible tracking on the CD's that will really be annoying to many of you fans.........seriously a bad error.....<br /><br />but the music is wonderful !<br /><br />time for a CD recall !!!

0545265355|5.0|it arrived sooner then expected. Its a gift for my wife she loved the movie and she likes to read im assuming she will enjoy these. If not i will. I don't read often but will be a year for the sequel to the movie so maybe ill read these instead.
B0015YFOHY|5.0|Dead Can Dance - Into The Labrynth , 1993 SACD<br /><br />  Over the past 10 years I have been slowly re-building my Dead Can Dance discography but after reading all the stunning reviews about \\"Into the Labryth SACD\\" I had to swing a copy....and all I can say is wow........this version eclipses the redbook CD by a long shot.  This may in fact be the best sounding recording I have in my entire collection......it is just that good.  Typical of DCD's music the songs are hypnotic and hugely addictive with some awesome worlds instrumentation.<br /><br />  Dead Can Dance is the genius of the musical partnership between Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry.  They have written tons of music together and all their albums are excellent with each one bringing in different elements.  They are a band that you will never grow tired of or stop listening to...really !<br /><br />  This album is a real eclectic mix of Eastern ,  Middle East and Celtic horror Soundscapes told thru the haunting voice of Brendan Perry and the versatile voice of Lisa Gerrard.  This album plays more like a movie soundtrack than it does an album of music !<br /><br />  I also recently picked up Lisa Gerrard's solo album \\"The Silver Tree\\" which I cant stop playing.<br /><br />  Simply Brilliant !

B003VWW23M|5.0|Moon Safari - Blomljud (2008)<br /><br />Blomljud (Swedish for \\"sound of flowers\\") was the second album released by this uniquely harmonic progressive 5 piece band Moon Safrari.  Sweden has produced some of my fav prog bands...Kaipa, Flower Kings, Anglagaard, Anekdoten etc....and now please add Moon Safari to this list.  Moon Safari blend pretty much everything into a very original sound....imagine the 70's symphonic stye of like Genesis with the neo prog keyboards and guitars of perhaps IQ and the alternative pop of maybe ELBOW or Coldplay and then blend in the vocal harmonies of maybe Yes and you have this band.  I love this album ...it is pure musical genius to me.  What really separates this band from the others is clearly the symphonic and harmonic aura of lead vocalist ....Simon Åkesson.  For those who remember Starcastle in many ways I think you can draw similarities minus the vocal copy of Jon Anderson.  But this album is as poppy as it is progressive and will appeal to fans of pop and prog at the same time...My daughter (12) came up into my music room  last night as I was playing this album and said \\"wow Daddy...these guys can really sing\\".  That says it all.....

B008FOB124|5.0|Dead Can Dance - Anastasis (2012)<br /><br />  We are the children of the sun......emotes Brendan Perry to open Anastasis......and what an opening !  After years Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard have come back together to release a new Dead Can Dance album.  I have been a huge fan of this band for a long time and was shocked to hear the news of a reunion album.<br />  No question that there is something magical when these two get together........I don't think DCD break any new ground that they haven't explored before on this album but who can argue with new songs from an old friend!<br />  What you are treated to is another excellent album full of tones, moods, themes and instrumentation that will leave you imagining!  DCD's music is somewhere between Eastern modal and North American Native chant and middle east themes.  As always they use a wide range of instrumentation and tons of varied hand percussion .  But most importantly Anastasis is another exploration into sound..  Lisa Gerard's ethereal vocals along with the contrasting deep stoic breaths of Brendan Perry make this another amazing addition to the Dead Can Dance discography.<br />  I highly recommend this album to anyone is loves to sit and listen to full albums.....and doesn't mind getting a bit scared in the dark !!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Second and Third books just get better and better. The first book doesn't even compare to the 2nd and 3rd. I've already started the trilogy over! Loved it!

B000065TNV|5.0|Sonny Rollins - Way Out West SACD<br /><br />I will admit that I was shocked to see that there are THREE version of \\"Way Out West\\" on SACD.....Analogue Productions, Japan SHM and this one on Fantasy (Hong Kong). Gee there are about 5 million albums I'd love on SACD and yet there are 3 separate versions of this one alone.......kinda crazy....<br />Anywho.......let me just say that I am big fan of Sonny Rollins and think that \\"Way Out West\\" is one of his great albums! I was a bit unsure if I should really own another version of this but with all the great reviews I decided to give it a try...and I am soooooo glad I did.<br /><br />I can not compare this version to the Japan or APO SACD releases but can say that I think this one is very good. The quality of the mix is actually quite amazing with great instrument separation and superb clear sound. This recording is warmer and smoother than the RBCD Remaster on Impulse I own and some of Rollins' sax feels like he is right in your living room playing beside you!<br /><br />On \\"come, gone\\" at the end there is some wild sax stereo panning going on (the 2 channel mix) and right at the end it is almost like Sonny turns and faces you as the listener.....it was almost like he had his back turned and then at the end shifted around......never heard anything quite like that before and dont recall that on the RBCD.<br /><br />I love the distinct drumming with such clarity in the left speaker while Rollings cherps away on the far right...while the bass is mid-left channel. This is really a fun recording and the great depth and stereo effects makes this SACD a real winner.<br /><br />The recording engineer was Roy DuNann who I think did a great job on the SACD mastering.

B005M4K94G|5.0|Santana - Caravanserai (1972), Mobile Fidelity SACD Remaster<br /><br />For me this IS the Santana album ! 1972's Caravanserai is the prefect mix of Latin American, Rock, Jazz, Fusion and Progressive Rock elements. Joining Carlos is Gregg Rolie (Journey), guitar legend Neal Schon, bassist Doug Raunch and the great drumming of Mike Shrieve who really excels on this album !<br /><br />And what a great job MoFi did on this SACD remaster. The instrumentation is nice and clean and feels perfect in presentation for my ears. The vocals, guitars, bass, keys and percussion are well balanced across the depths of this recording. This album is also better played at slightly elevated volume levels too where the musical prowess feels more alive and accentuated.<br /><br />I also really noticed the sonic separation of the hand percussion on this recording and some of the backing vocals where a few times i actually looked behind me as I listened to this recording.<br /><br />This album is a gem and I have never heard it sound sooooo good....

B0066W1AZK|5.0|Thy app shoppe has provided a sweet free chess game. Chess is hard to get wrong especially when its free! I've read the lower reviews and let me just tell you- those people are nuts. &#34;I can't castle&#34;; sometimes on the street playing the homeless guys, i can't castle there either. In fact sometimes they wanna do en passant, whatever right. &#34;Bugs&#34; again, playing guys on the street waiting for the bus or whatever, you're dealing with real live arthropods! and talk about a buggy game, when was the last theyou played a human? Playing you're brother in law- now that's a glitch! &#34;won't let me move my piece&#34; thats because its an illegal move there Bobby, did you check your King? Oh another piece can capture him? ya you can only move a select few pieces now.....<br />Bottom line is, you like chess, wanna play chess, then play it, oh look here is a free way to do that! You won't gain much if anything by dropping 5 bucks on a chess app.
B0056K4VZ4|5.0|Keb Mo , Mobile Fidelity 1994, SACD<br /><br />  I first heard Kevin Moore aka Keb'Mo' a number of years ago and was immediately drawn to his playing and his creativity....Keb is way more than just a R&B artist.  Keb Mo is a blues guitarist and vocalist who draws heavily on this debut album on the approach and work of blues legend Robert Johnson who clearly had a major influence on his music.  What makes Keb Mo stand out for me on this album is his integration of callsic blues with soul and folk genres and all wrapped around his own sense and interpretation of his music.<br />  The folks at Mobile Fidelity have done a great job in remastering and presenting Keb MO's debut album is glorious SACD emitting great clarity and tones.

Soldier Of Love: 5/10 I always thought this was an awkward R&B song. Weird electronic production.<br />3. Morning Bird: 8/10<br />4. Babyfather: 7.5/10<br />5. Long Hard Road: 7/10 Indistinct but not annoying like \\"Soldier...\\"<br />6. Be That Easy: 7.5/10<br />7. Bring Me Home: 6/10 Didn't stick out as I listened.<br />8. In Another Time: 9/10 Seems like this is as classic as Sade is going to get on this 2010 disc. I feel the melancholy in the lyrics and especially jazzy production values here.<br />9.

B004A8ZWWO|4.0|The Tower Heist got average review ( like most of Ben Stiller's movies), but in my opinion, it was great.  It had a nice plot, great photography, and I have watched it more then once because its fun. I liked the cast of characters and Eddie Murphy played his role well. Alan Alda is not usually the bad guy, but he did a good job as one in the movie. The ending was sort of silly, but it was exactly what you would want happen in a Robin Hood type of movie. Rob from the rich guy, who was really scummy liar, and give back to the poor who were robbed of what was rightfully theirs,

B009ERK1T0|5.0|This album is another gem. They keep growing musically but still have some heavy songs that please their old fans. Chino's voice is what captured my attention the most. He has proven to be a limitless frontman. Stephen guitar sound full and pronounced more than ever. The album was good the first listen but as listdn to it more and more it gets so much bdtter with each listen so many layers. A definite must have in your collection of great rock/alternative/metal.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app needs some work. I really don't care of the layout. You can't really pick out the people who you would like to see your posts if you choose to change who sees a particular post. It's more meant for just checking facebook. You can't play most of the games that you would play on facebook. And chatting with friends isn't easy either. You can't really change the settings or availability either. I'm not too excited about this app but it is free so I guess I can't complain too much. Just wanted to point out the flaws as to not let people be disappointed with what they expected it to be.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not the best of the trilogy. What started out fun and exotic turned into the &#34;same old love story&#34;. If you love fairtail happy endings this is the book for you.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are pretty cool. takes me back in the day. others are ridiculously stupid n not worth playing.
B006LSZECO|1.0|One of the worst written and developed or lack thereof stories,laced with crudeness that doesn't fit. Very simple. Hard to believe the \\"good\\" reviews. A total waste of money and time. Giving this book one star is more than generous.Wouldn't even make a good \\"made for TV movie\\".
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am looking for any help I can get as I go gluten-free and this book is great.  I discovered that I'm losing weight quickly and easily for the first time in my life.  Amazing!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Exciting, thrilling, filled with passion and desire. It was nonstop excitement, I couldn't put the book down. This is a definite 5 star!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I absolutly love the game. But I got really far in the game but it made me start over again. And i am not happy about it and
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout. I suggest having two different sets of weights on hand. I have 5 lbs and 8 lbs. One thing I recommend is adding in extra cardio with this workout. This is great for toning and keeping the heartrate up, but you definitely need more cardio. You must have a good diet plan in place as well. Track your calories, watch your sugar intake and eat extra protein since you're building up your muscles.<br /><br />Don't do what I did. I'm in relatively good shape and day 1 I did level 1. Day 2 I skipped level 1 and went to level 2. I suggest waiting until level 1 starts to seem a little easy before switch to level 2.<br /><br />Good luck!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Great music from The Black Keys. They never fail to impress. I highly recommend their stuff, you won't regret it!
B00526ZKYS|5.0|The authors ideas are so amazing you want to read more and more. I can't wait for the third book to come out!
B007SGM084|5.0|Was a very good purchase.  This is one that keeps you coming back for more, very hard to put down!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an app that is easy and fun at the earlier stages - great as a warm up or to work with kids.  However, the later stages can be challenging for everyone!
B007T99ENE|2.0|I hate writing this review because I have so enjoyed all of Ian McEwan's previous novels, but Sweet Tooth was anything but. A spy story with no action and little intrigue, the story crept along at a snail's pace to a conclusion both contrived and disappointing. Sorry, Ian, it just doesn't work.
B006RUJST6|4.0|This was a fun story. Kept me interested throughout. It could use a little more excitement, but overall a cute story.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Easy to setup...just connect and everything works perfectly. Cable is long and thick. I used this cable to connect my laptop to external harddrives across the room...works great and data copying speed is also good. It also works if you want to use a wireless mouse/wireless keyboard. However, it doesn't have a power supply, so you can't charge your ipod from across the room.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The Pather is way too long and too many stupid comments throughout the book.  The book could have been written with the pages
B00902MCVY|5.0|Not radio-rock by any measure; this is a true metal symphony, filled with variation and surprises and demonstrating unbridled passion. Thank you Jari for not allowing anyone to place limits on you. The music does something for me. That's all there is to say. I will be awaiting part II.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the story. The author tells two sides and it has some very interesting twists and turns. This is a great mystery!
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because of all the hype it was getting. It was a very difficult read. I didn't really like the characters and after I struggled through the entire book, I kept asking myself, \\"did I miss the plot?\\" I don't mind sex in a book (although I wouldn't exactly call what transpired in this book \\"sex\\", filled as it was with bondage and abuse) but it was VERY repetitive and it seemed that there was no other reason for the book to have been written. This was disappointing and for me, a complete waste of time, as I need more than sex for the sake of sex to find meaning in a book.  I do not think the book was a romance, as some have called it, and I don't think it was well written. I am an avid reader, and I like fiction, mystery, crime, romance, horror, detective and historical novels, to name a few. But I will not pursue this series.
0307277887|5.0|I bought this for my friend for his birthday. He loves the plot of the book and plans on getting more of the series.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I haven't spent a ton of time with this app yet, but I've had a blast so far!  Easy to follow and sounds great
B005MMJ84K|5.0|So exciting, I couldn't put it down. The author creates a whole new world. Very interesting concept where the world ends up.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer  I enjoyed it very much. i am a true fan of John Grisham. One of his  best!! Recommend Highly.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Watched this movie to please my better half and wound up loving it.  Great actors and compelling story I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me guessing till the very end! Excellently written and a fascinating story line. I highly recommend this great book!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This one is not as good as the first but is better than the third. Author keeps you wanting more.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love playing this version of Spider, except for the ads in between games it would be perfect. I would recommend it.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This was the first and only book I've read cover to cover without putting down. I think I finished this book in 6-8 hours or something like that. Of course, I was enthralled with the marketing of my own book. An excellent read with some good tips which I employed the same day after reading it. There are a couple of concepts though which are a little suspect, the main one being that its the blog that will drive traffic to one's site to advertise for the book. I've since read his blog and I was not that impressed. I'm sure he would say that I'm not in his target demographic, but I think it's an honest assessment. Still, it is an excellent idea and ONE piece of a puzzle that should be employed. His other ideas are also excellent. Many common sense ideas and worth the read and the buy.
0307888681|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but I'm not really looking forward to seeing it on the big screen with Brad Pitt. The movie seems to have nothing to do with the book; I feel like they just purchased the rights to the book so that they could have the title; which doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not quite what I expected but a good read<br />Ending was unexpected - glad not totally predictable<br />Read if you enjoyed the others
B00A8ECU24|5.0|wooot this game is win for all the broneys... its like farmville but with the best kind of poneys I absolutely love it.
0765367351|5.0|This was interesting read. You dive into the creation of Rapture and the mind of Andrew Ryan. It's not a hard read but nonetheless a must read.
1400049628|5.0|Max Brooks is a great author when it comes to the &#34;preparedness&#34; side of the zombie apocalypse! This book was a good read and I would recommend it!
0062124293|5.0|I loved this book!  It really got me thinking about feminism as I know it.  It's a thinking book that at points had me laughing so hard I cried (in public, on a plane).  I would recommend this book for basically anyone.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor is outstanding. I had the previous 940 black edition and this makes the speed seem slow! Fantastic shipping speed and I would recommend this product to everyone.
B0086700CM|5.0|best version yet love the demon monkeys hope there is new updates to make it even better needed three words
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is so fun I went to hell about 20 times its pretty hard and pretty low but a lot eaisier than it seems especially with iron pickaxe
B009X01D9U|5.0|I just received my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 as a gift and I absolutely love it.  In regards to the protective cover I wanted to go a little 'kooky' so with the color I picked orange (who woulda thunk) and it is great.  The quality is superior inside and out.  The Kindle snaps into place so it is secure and swivels if I want it to stand vertical.  Overall, well worth the money.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Haven't read such a descriptive novel in quite some time SK NAILED this one!! Highly recomend reading this novel. It's a hard one to  put down.
B003U69IX6|3.0|Good family movie if you've seen everything else. The movie does not have any slow periods and tends to keep your interest throughout the movie.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Literally the best gaming headset I have used, Very durable! Exactly what I wanted at a great price and shipped in a timely manner. What else could you ask for.
B003NX76BM|4.0|I love dogs, I am very interested in special training, I love romance, and I love mystery/suspense - all this and more were in this book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|totally addictive and fun. I'm very much enjoying playing and the dragons are different and fun and breeding different dragons for specific spawn is neat.
B008B68IEA|5.0|I recommend this ice bed to any monster high collector.  Perfect addition for your monster high collection.  Very cute!!!! Little girls will love this!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham  is back. It was a book I didn't want to put down yet had to because I didn't want the characters  to lose their objectivity. I sometimes feared greed taking over love.It may have gotten a little long at the end. But I found it to be an excellent read and hope his next one comes out soon.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|My title is biased. I think this is the greatest sci-fi I have ever seen. I am 30 years old and for the first time in my life I felt like I was 10 again while watching John Carter. I think it was 100% the best the movie could be and it will be a shame to cinema if they do not make a sequel. I DO NOT care about the box office sales or the horrible word of mouth from cirtics with horrible taste.<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie at least twice you should never review this movie. Mood effects how you intake a movie. Wake up with a fresh mind and turn this flick on and if you do not like it then obviously you are crazy (jk).<br /><br />Every time I see a shooting star I will be \\"wishing for a john carter sequel\\".
B008NW67E0|4.0|We have probably listened to this cd 20 times already. It is just that good. I would prefer if they didn't feel the need to use the f-word but it is easy enough just to skip that song.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|2:45 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Horrible movie, just like the last batsman movie. Even the fight scenes looked stupid. Don't waste your money.
0345803485|5.0|best book ever and never a dull moment, once you open this book it will be hard to put it down,,,love it !
0061711292|2.0|Our Ms. Jean Brodie believes she has been betrayed but lacks even the tiniest bit of self-awareness needed to see that she was the betrayer.She has betrayed the trust her students have in her. She is cruel,manipulative,backstabbing and absolutely convinced of the rightness of her beliefs. This is a woman who manipulates a student into having sex with a married man. Are we supposed to think she is enlightened because she rebels at traditional education?  Who,in 1938,is a Hitler sympathizer?<br />From a literary standpoint,it seems as though it was written by an amateur-professional writer. I expected more.If it was not so short I would give it one star.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I LOVED the Harry Potter books and the movies (especially this last one) did not disappoint. Happy to have the complete set now!
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|Don't waste your time or money. This is a slow and boring movie. Not worth th $20.00 I just wasted.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|If you are a comic fan who enjoyed all the recent hero movies from Iron Man to Captain America, this movie does not disappoint. It is fun and action and everything you'd expect from a great comic adventure and the actors all mixed well together.
B0098460O4|5.0|Love them...hope they continue singing together and as solos.  Simon Cowell knows what greatness is.<br />Lovely gift for old and young.
B0053O89Z6|4.0|We've really enjoyed watching this program. Looking forward to finally knowing who the mom is! Pretty sure Neil Patrick Harris is the best actor!
B008CP92ZO|2.0|This is one of those movies that seems like a great idea on paper, but mostly winds up making predictable and easy jokes. It leans on so many things we've seen before that it just left a bland taste in my mouth. It's nothing personal, as all the actors involved are mostly top notch, there's just no meat on this bone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of those books you don't want to end. Thank God there's more coming. Howey's character development is brilliant. His ability to put the reader in the scene literally left me gasping for air on one occasion and my heart racing in another. If you're looking for the next great science fiction writer, read this book.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|love this game great on kindle fun playing with freinds and its fast great better than yahtzee love it!!!<br />a must have on kindle fire
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book really gives the true meaning of time and it opens your eyes to what matter  most. Time isn't about being measured its about being lived. Recommend to anyone.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|(Mostly) satisfying conclusion to the Nolan Batman trilogy. Yes, there are some continuity problems, and a few minor character flaws, but all in all a must-see for even the casual Batman fan.
B0031RS7EK|5.0|Real...  I was an army medic and never one of those &#34;insane f**kers&#34;, but I have always admired their total commitment. To read the thoughts and get inside the head of an ex-SAS operative ... WOW!
1595141715|4.0|the book was thrilling and amazingly written. i do reccomed this book to anyone who likes books that will leave you guessing.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Would be nice  if the news feed worked. I decided to delete after only one day. Guess I'll just have to keep using my phone &amp; computer.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|I really enjoyed American Horror Story 1.  I was hooked from the beginning.<br />I found American 2 very disjointed. It was too horrific.
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|All of her albums are amazing, but this one has so much soul it blows ones mind into little firewood.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just like world war 1  in fall of giants, this book made you feel what it was like to be a part of world war 2 from the perspective of so many different cultures. American, German, Russian, English, Welsh, and french were weaved together in a captivating story that I couldn't put down. I really felt like I was experiencing history, not just reading about it. Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors, and this one was on par with any of his other novels I have read. I strongly recommend it.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book!  Enzo is a wonderful dog and Denny is a great guy.  There is so much of value here it is hard to detail it all.  I loved the way the story reflected my philosophy on goal setting and perseverance as the way to success.  I bought a paperback version for my son, who I know will enjoy it for all that as well as the references to professional car racing.  All in all, a really great read!
B0068LYEHA|3.0|I got this for a beach read, and it was a perfect beach read, however uneven it was. The book alternates from moments that had my holding my sides with laughter, grabbing anyone near to share the paragraph to parts that I skimmed wholesale because they dragged a little. Still, I'd recommend it. It's funny and insightful.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|the movie thing was so cool I play the game every day . they need to make a batman and wizard of oz.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Permissions required are out of control. Why need access to the camera? This is disconcerting and game developers need to curb this trend.
156865314X|5.0|I ordered this large print book for my 87 year old grandmother... She loves to read but her eyes are not that good anymore.. She loved the large print...
B00913P6G0|5.0|This is not an album. This is a story. A book. A good one. Buy this album and listen to the story. Great beats as well.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm a teacher and heard a district bought this for all of their kids, that's why I read it.  It was a great book.  It would work well as a mentor text in the middle schools.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is wonderful.  Thank you so much for providing this for free.  I find myself using it quite often.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I was a Big fan of Ken Follett already.  If you liked Pillars Of The Earth you will love this.  I got this after the second book came out - read right through this one and had to start the next right away!  It is a great read and the history I learned was a great bonus
B0000669JL|5.0|I love Bob Marley's music and by all accounts he was an outstanding musician and a good man. I bought this CD after watching  Kevin Macdonald's Biopic and continue to enjoy the lyrics, reggae rhythms, authentic Jamaican twang - and pervasive sense of hope and redemption.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great app! I love puzzles, and this is definitely a great app to pass the time. I highly reccommend it! :-)
B009HELT3C|4.0|i was somewhat hesitant to watch this movie, however i am glad that i did so. It was funny and then the fast pace. Exactly what I would expect from a man in black movie. I would put this on our with the first and second one.  Definitely worth watching.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Read the first book before this one to get into the story.  While this is an amazing read on its own it is even better in sequence!  Can't wait for book 3!!
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I have always been a ghost rider fan. Though not like the comic,It's just fun for me to see &#34;him&#34; on screen.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I LOVE THIS APP SOOOOOO MUCH!!!! there are some limitations though. For instance, when I first got it, I noticed that when I clicked on the Color menu, I couldn't get back to the other menus without resetting the whole thing. Found that out though! I have a kindle fire, and so  the way you get back is you press the main menu button and then hit the back button.it then keeps your current settings but allows you to access all the menus again. and one more thing! you cant save!!! GAH!<br />so I guess I'll just have to take a picture with my camera... so this is for people who love just to do something mezmirizing to fill their time. And this time, the stars really do revolve around you!!!!!
B001U0HAYS|5.0|I like this movie, always have, its not action packed or fast paced but a good story with good acting. My wife actually found this slow and boring for her, just shows how we have changed our ways of watching things, in the day this was considered quite chilling in its tale of misdeeds by government agency's. A good story well directed by sydney pollack, good acting by robert redford, faye dunaway and max von sydow who is the assassin but you never feel bad for him just understanding to his position.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is very very fun maker I think it's notch I might be wrong but any way I want u to update minecraft 3 more time at least or more plea pretty plea
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This has proven to be one of the greatest series onTV. I hope that it continues to be so! it's just supernatural
B000VNMMQG|5.0|We knew little about Wilber Wilberforce  and the role he played in abolishing the slave trade in England.  We will listen to the hymn &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; with new understanding.  We share this movie with our grandchildren to educate them to situations and a period of history they've known little about.
B0025WG4SS|5.0|The Turtles have alway been a great group  Their music is timeless and upbeat. Can't knock that  I love it
B008B68IV8|5.0|Ghoulia is one of my favorite characters in Monster High.  This is easily my favorite doll of hers, esp. in basic slim box releases!  Compared to Abbey and Draculaura - the other slim boxed girls in this line - she's the best dressed, and most fashion forward, from head to toe.<br /><br />Her simple hoodie-dress is given a little ghoulish style with a spine and ribcage design down the front.  Some people have complained about the increased \\"gore-ish\\" designs on Ghoulia's recent releases, but I think it's cutely done.  Scaris Ghoulia has one of the best hairstyles on any doll I've seen yet.  The lack of a stand isn't a huge deal for me, since I'm a collector who leaves the dolls in their boxes.<br /><br />If you love Ghoulia, she's a must own.  But I definitely wouldn't pay more than list price for her, or any of the other basics in the Scaris line.  If you can't buy her via Amazon, then search the local stores.  They're out there, don't let the scalpers discourage you from getting a deal!
B008B68IUY|5.0|The love the detail in detail.  I wish the paint had a sparkle, but the intricate detailing in the artwork is great.  The love the gear shift and dual cupholders.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|Really enjoyed the filming style of this movie and would like to see more movies shot in this format. The picture quality is extremely crisp and am looking forward to the sequel
B00A77II0U|5.0|good graphics and interesting plot.<br />I liked the complexity of the hidden objects. wish it had been longer but good value for the price.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I could write and write, but there is not much that I could add that has not already been said.  This is simply the best Stephen King book to date.  I would love to see this made into a TV series as opposed to the limits of a movie or mini series.
B008B68J2G|5.0|The cart, the chair, he bench, the everything is so pretty.  The colors they are painted are bod and not dull.  Love it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I no longer have to carry a bible with me to church or bible study.  I can simply pull up this app and have it quickly find the scripture I'm searching for without having to fumble around like I typically do.  A big bonus is, it'll read it to you via it's audio function, so if you can't see the words on the screen [and it's hard for me with my little Android phone to see all this without my reading glasses].  I can simply slip on the single ear-piece and nobody knows I'm not reading it with my eyes, but listening to it with my ears.
B004LX0D36|4.0|I always love the vicious innocence with which Jane Austen tears her characters apart, and Sense and Sensibility is a prime example. Her brutally sarcastic observations of the British upper class reduce her antagonists to sniveling school children who cry and grovel and simper their way through life behind a thin veil of dignity, a veil gleefully ripped open by Austen.<br /><br />From her opinions of parents:<br />\\"...a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow anything...\\"<br /><br />to the value of children:<br />\\"On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of others.\\"<br /><br />Austen constructs a tantalising slaughterhouse of a book, inside which she adorns her hooks with a dazzling array of conceited, deceitful and shameless characters, few of whom escape her witty blade. All this however is not to say the novel is bereft of heart. As the title suggests, the central theme is the conflict and reconciliation between heart and mind, exemplified respectively in Marianne and Elinor, both of whom are endearing characters in their own ways, despite their flaws. It is this respect, no matter how faint, that Austen shows her characters that elevates the story above a satirical denunciation of her society and allows the reader to lose themselves in her narrative and become attached to her players.<br /><br />The overall flaw for me, were the happy endings handed out like charity flyers, though the fact that everybody gets one - from her most hated of villains to the most saintly of maidens, somewhat tempers the sacchariferousness. Sense and Sensibility was an utter pleasure to read - and surprisingly enjoyable when read side by side with Game of Thrones Book 3 - A Storm of Swords. When the clumsy fantasy writing made me cringe too much I could switch back to the succulent eloquence of Austen, and when sitting around in parlours reading the subtext behind eyebrow lifts became a little tedious, I could flip back to sex and bloodshed. Unfortunately due to the size differences in the books, I was only 44% of the way into Game of Thrones when I finished Sense and Sensibility and was forced to endure another six hundred pages of undiluted lumbering nerd prose.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|the best app ever so happy to have got this app got my app store running more fast than ever I love It get it it is such a good app
B007L6VR6M|4.0|I have every movie Wes Anderson had directed, so I had to own this! I saw it twice in theaters with two very different groups of friends. One groupe loved it as much as I did, and the other groupe hated it.. Oh well.... It's not as good as 'Life Aquatic' but its better than 'The Darjeeling Limited'..
B0026MOVO6|5.0|Ok, full disclosure, I am and always will be a Whitney Houston fan.  This album was so underrated.  I thought about purchasing when it was released but never quite got around to it.  Every track is one I have come to enjoy.  I bought it for songs like It's not right..but it's ok, My Love and Heartbreak Hotel that earned radio play but I have come to enjoy the others as well.  This album has a near constant rotation in my car's CD player and my heart.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is a unique puzzle game, that really requires a lot of thought. It is very challenging but solvable, and that's what makes it fun. The graphics are simple but good, and the game is easy to learn how to play with thorough tutorials. It is definitely one of my favorite games on my kindle fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great second book.  If<br />this doesn't remind you of<br />the struggle for freedom<br />nothing will.  Great for all ages.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|great observations on the human condition, macabre but frighteningly still believable.<br />don't read it in bed with your partner though
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a nice relaxing game. one that I don't mind letting my kids play. it's fun and is great for in the car. I do wish however that it would quit restarting from the beginning. it's both frustrating and sad when my kids start crying because they just earned the bunny and then they loose it. but try again they do.lol thank goodness its just a game.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This is a good One direction book among others has personal and correct info on the boys and won't disappoint.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Addictive, hard to stop. Unlike the first book, it's only part of a story... have to read the next one.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|My son is a huge fan of angry birds and wanted this for awhile.  Once he finally got it, he played with it for a few minutes (tops) and hasn't touched it since.  The pieces are made very poorly and it's tough to stack them.  The game is inteded to make it tough to knock the pieces down...instead; it is almost impossible to get them to stand up right.<br /><br />He liked the concept of the game though so we went to the dollar store and got a cheap slingshot, dug up some old wooden blocks and he sets those up and knocks them down instead and has a great time!<br /><br />This toy is not worth getting at any price (even free).  Don't waste your time or money.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|Had I given this a single one-star rating, nobody would read my review thinking that I'm just a Disney-hater...but there's more to it than that.  True, the scene animation and voice characterizations are stellar.  But make no mistake, this is a HORROR MOVIE packaged as a PG children's movie.  Disney doesn't care one bit about all those children aged 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? etc who were dragged into the theater by their unwitting parent and exposed to some of the most horrific and startling images imaginable.  Why is Hollywood so hell-bent on hastening our children's transition from innocence to trauma-survivor??!!!  I can say that with some credibility as I am a therapist with trauma survivors...and there is such a thing as cumulative trauma.  This movie should have been rated at least PG-13, but Disney accomplished what they set out to do in creating a stunningly haunting adaptation.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I played a little bit of Halo 3 on my brother's Xbox but never got into it. The series Red Vs. Blue was what started my interest, but I didn't stop there. I got Halo: The Fall of Reach on my kindle fire and finished the book in six days. I was blown away to say the least. I can't wait to start the next book. Good work Eric Nylund, you've made a fan of me.

B00ADYYY50|4.0|I didn't like it at first, but then I watched a few videos about wiz talking about each song and what they mean more then just the obvious, and I listened to it again to see if I would start to like it and I did. It's a decent album BUT, I still wish he made things like prince of the city and kush & oj, but, then again, if he kept rapping the \\"i go hard persona\\" now, it would be weird because thats not what he is living right now, hes talking about what is going on in his life right now, and thats money, weed, partying, and amber. So, yes a lot of its about money but, its still talking about whats s going on in his life.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I would never even begin to parent the way Amy Chua did but this story was excellent. She made me re-think the Western culture and conclude that we need a balance between her style and ours. Her transparency about the whole family was wonderful; I hope her husband is okay with it! The writing was excellent. I would love to read a sequel and know how she and the girls are doing now.
1476719071|1.0|COMPLETE TRASH. Glorifies phyiscal abuse, mental abuse, co-dependence, drinking, smoking, and more. I am ashamed that a book like this would be published, encouraging young women to stay with an abusive, controlling boy/man. Completely sickening. Also, what planet is this author from?? The 19-year old kids are supposed to be in college, yet classes are barely mentioned. I guess that's because the kids are too busy flying to Vegas, being served everywhere they go, fighting the mob, drinking shots to the point of poisoning, partying all night, generoulsy partaking nightly in their own supply of whisky because it will help you sleep, and mistaking hot sex for love. Please. This is such a depressing book, where not even one character emerges as strong and healthy. They are all weak, controlling, complete emotional disasters. Exactly what we work so hard to nurture our kids NOT to be. Gives every hard-working college student an undeserved bad name. Note to the author: I feel sorry for your kids; they are going to have no guidance in reality from their childish, immature mother who thinks that this is what college-age students are all about/want to read. Sheesh! Get a clue, and get a brain while you're at it. You obviously don't have much of one now.

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Following her traditional multi-perspective style, this is a very good book...but, I'd put it in the middle of her collection.  It deals with teen suicide, teen incarceration, the impact of strained family relationships, and courtroom strategies...all of which she turns into compelling reading.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|These kinds of serious movies rarely make it into public consciousness. They're too deep and candid for the herd of shallow people who would rather see car chases and special effects. Especially if you have ever been a teacher, student, parent, or child...this movie will get to you.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I love all of the tracks on this EP.  It is amazing to hear all that they are able to do with just their voices.  I have listened to the songs over and over again just to hear all the little details.  My only complaint is that there are only six songs since this is just an EP.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|First off, ultraviolet is an amazing format.  Is it itunes? No its not.  UV (Ultraviolet) work with all my Blu ray players, all my phones, PS3, XBOX 360, Ipod touch, and a lot more than itunes does.  I have purchased a lot on itunes.  However, I kept running out of disk space, because I love moves, and have hundreds of them on my hard drive. With this movie, all I have to do is input a code online and the movie can be streamed in all the rooms in my house. With itunes, I can watch it on my laptop and PC or MAC, and can only stream through Apple TV.  UV works with about any Blu Ray player and was formed by about 100 different companies.<br /><br />The movie/disks, its amazing too.  Full of features and a great movie.  I don't need to go into detail because many other reviewers have.  If you liked the first two.  Its safe to say you will like this one too.<br /><br />btw... The first two batman movies I bought didn't come with itunes, and UV wasn't around then.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|I have always enjoyed Ken Follett's work and Fall of Giants is no exception.  I like the way Follett brings history to life through the lives of his characters. I had no more than a cursory idea of the early 1900s and what brought us to, and through ,WWI  until I read this book.<br />My only &#34;criticism&#34; is that I was not motivated to read it all in one sitting, but I love thick books , long stories when I care  about the characters and that is what this book is.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Although I have never really been a fan of musicals, I absolutely fell in love with rent after my girlfriend took me to go see the musical live. Although the movie is set in the 1980's the musical version I had seen portrays Roger to be more of a 90's grunge rocker modeled after Kurt Cobain. It really peaked my interest to see the differences in how the musical I saw portrayed characters differently. The movie version has an outstanding cast such as Rosario Dawson and Ty Diggs. If you're a Rent fanatic this is a must have. However, if you are a general fan of musical you will also enjoy this movie

B000002OOY|5.0|In 1993, once again Steven Spielberg managed to dazzle and excite audiences with his vision of Michael Crichton's 'Jurassic Park'; the story of a wildlife preserve that housed animals extinct for 65 million years - and the disaster that befell it as the park's security system broke down, the prehistoric creatures broke out, and terror followed those invited to a preview of the park. Spielberg's amazing effort here would not have been complete without the exciting, brilliant score of the legendary John Williams, who had collaborated with Spielberg on such masterpieces as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Jaws', and 'E.T; The Extra-Terrestrial'.<br /><br />Williams creates a score that emphasizes the enormous, grandiose scheme of Jurassic Park and its inhabitants; a trumpet fanfare is used to portray the helicopter's landing at a landing pad near a massive, 100+ foot waterfall. He uses a string motif that creates a sense of amazement as Drs. Grant & Sattler get their first glimpse of the park's residents - a huge Brachiosaurus. A theme of despair, using strings & woodwinds, is prevalent when Ellie & Robert Muldoon are searching for Alan Grant and the others & discover the pitiful remains of lawyer Gennaro (who had been killed by the Tyrannosaurus); a panicked flute/clarinet motif depicts Ellie Sattler's desperate run to the electrical compound through Velociraptor-patrolled jungle terrain. The theme appears again as Sattler begins her run back towards the compound where Hammond and the others are holed up. French horns & trumpets punctuate a despairing string cue as the survivors climb over the skeletons of the Tyrannosaur & Brontosaur, only to find themselves threatened by the 2 Velociraptors who have been pursuing them. The end title depicted a somewhat melancholy take on a 4-note theme heard throughout the film; this was one I took to be either Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) theme or the theme for Jurassic Park itself. The only complaint I have is that the Tyrannosaurus chase cue was missing.<br /><br />Once again, John Williams has shown why he is the undisputed master of the soundtrack. This is a worthy addition to any collection.s chase cue was missing.<br /><br />Once again, John Williams has shown why he is the undisputed master of the soundtrack.

B000FC1MM8|3.0|I like Harry, because I have a lot of respect for the police and know that they are shackled by bureaucracy that oftentimes makes no sense and is hurtful.  That being said there are rules that have to be followed and society would not be a pleasant place if everyone ran they way they wanted.  Sometimes you have to follow the rules and let the chips fall where they may.  Harry needs to accept this.  It's time.

0062183591|5.0|I was required to read this book as a student in Carlow University Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics course on Forensic Research and Analysis.  Please feel free to view the homepage with the following provided link. [...]    Although, it was required reading material for the course, I could not put the book down.  In this course we are learning how to implement the scientific method into fraud investigations to rely on evidence and not opinions, assumptions, theories, or hunches.  His book was a wonderful tool to use in the course to provide practical, clear, concise examples of applying this method into investigations.  I loved the mixture of humor and the clear, concise explanations of the various experiments conducted.  I was only required to read approximately 3 chapters; however, I read the whole book; it was addictive.  As a result of reading the book, I have a different outlook on cheating and dishonesty due to Ariely's \\"fudge factor\\" conclusion, which is we cheat just enough so that we can still see ourselves as honest and good people.  Who would have thought that we mere humans reason, measure and rationalize our levels of cheating and dishonesty by our own comfort measures.  Sadly, my children are not happy with my enjoyment of this book because I am doing my own versions of his experiments on my children. One such experiment I conducted was my version of his \\"Coke vs. Money\\" experiment except I used \\"Pizza vs. Money\\".  The result of my experiment, the money was ignored and the pizza was gone.  After interrogating my children, they did not see taking the pizza as stealing, but the money was viewed as stealing; matching his results of his experiment.  They are now slightly paranoid whenever I have \\"kid\\" appealing food in the house, checking to see if it is another experiment.  Unfortunately for them, I am not done. I am having too much fun discovering the level of cheating of my \\"angelic\\" children.    While most of his experiments were conducted with college students in controlled conditions, it would have been an interesting contrast to see if these same conclusions would be reached with different participants in different environments, such as workplace settings to provide more outcome comparables for his readers.  However, this book will be very instrumental in my pursuits in the field of Forensic Accounting, because I now am more aware of not relying on my hunches or assumptions when investigating or researching incidents, but will rely on the conclusions resulted from applying the scientific method to investigations.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Just as good as the virtual city's with stories. but in this you follow goals and build your ultimate city fantasy. you build it up and maintain it. I recommend this to all you ros k the Vegas or dragon story or just fans of games like this.

Why is there even a limit to this since the digital movies have to go through the UltraViolet and Flixter services to even be watched.  Seems like a needless limitation.

B008LZHA3G|3.0|I love Dylan, I'm a child of the 60s after all, but his voice is getting so raspy that it's painful to listen to at times. The music is great and some of the songs are fine but I found the Titanic song interminable and musically uninteresting. BTW, one of my favorite Dylan tunes, Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands, is even longer but much more enthralling.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Decent way to waste time. I wish extra puzzles were less expensive though, perhaps a bunch for $5 instead of $1 each.

B000000WHC|4.0|The late great Gary Moore was a rock guitarist than a blues guitarist, hence I'd say this CD is more rock/blues. I think he's underrated as a singer but there is no underestimating his guitar playing abilities -- they are first rate. He can play lightening quick but also knows how to milk some fine tones out of his guitar. If you like Walter Trout, you'll like this one too.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|Terrific at graphically telling me status of battery. I especially like its verbal notifications about the charge level, soft tone and voice, and flexible settings. I can even select nighttime silence period so charge level warnings don't wake people up though I'd like to be able to adjust the hours of silence. Another drawback is it estimates how long the battery charge level will last while using the Fire HD for functions it doesn't have. On the other hand it gives capacity estimate for functions the HD can do.<br />Weirdly it gives the temperature, I guess of the battery though there's no explanation of what optimal temp would be. I'm not even sure that the Fire HD can measure the temperature of anything.<br />Lastly the app can \\"calibrate\\" with \\"the community\\" your Fire under categories of \\"music,\\" \\"movies,\\" and \\"Internet.\\" These \\"tests\\" take many minutes and I have no idea what they are really testing or calibrating. Beats me. But I nevertheless quite like this colorful program and recommend it for pure fooling-around-technical-looking-computer-geeking. Like getting a chemistry set in middle school felt; all those test tubes and bottles of colored stuff including cobalt. Not sure what to do with it but it is still very cool.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am a person who needs a book to grab me immediatly or I move on. Gillian Flynn is an amazing author. I really enjoyed her raw, in your face characters. She grabs you with topics that were shocking and made me constantly say \\"who done it\\" It talked about Death, and sex and abuse, but didnt go overboard and slam it in your face and go all fifty shades on you.  I seriously could not put this book down. The only thing I would say negative is, after reading this and Sharp Objects she focuses on female characters and female villians. If she soon comes out with another book I hope its not the same ol' story. I enjoy being shocked and surprised when the story finally unfolds. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a short murder mystery where you can not help but absolulty love the main characters!~
0439023521|5.0|So, I'm over 30 and &#34;The hunger game&#34; is considered to be a youth novel, But I just couldn't stop reading this book (while 'Twilight' and I didn't really connect). The suspense, the plot, the characters, the unexpected turns, the depth and sincerity are all so compelling. I highly recommend The Hunger Games.
0345803493|1.0|I forced myself thru this book, skipped most of it and rolled my eyes like I was a teenager. The first one was in your face raunchy, sometimes exciting but mainly just In your face crude. Then the 2nd one was like, waiting for a story that never happened.Even when it was supossed to be exciting, the Ex Girlfriend came into the story. This could have gone so many ways but it was like...ummm...thats it? Ok that was kind of a suspence. Then the rest of the book goes, Ok, we get it the sex is great. The 3rd book..My god! no one needs to be that obsessed and rich and posessive. Its not healthy to be this way, \\"Your mine\\" \\"Im yours\\" \\"Your mine\\" \\"I'm yours, lets have sex\\" Its like the author just tried as hard as she could be be a nasty as possible and so many people ate this up. I dont get it. I waited for Christian to be im-perfect or have a personality or be daring. but it never happened. It told you he was a dark person but never really became dark. Who cares that you use toys? I bet a lot of people use toys and dont freak out when you touch their chest. That part of the story could have gone better also, it makes you wonder why he doesnt like to be touched...you winder and wonder then its like. Um ok. Shocking!! Not really.  Seriously, I only read the books to say I read the books and now I cant because the Freed book was so bad I cant even force myself to start it.

B0052SF6CM|5.0|Buy this CD, or MP3 album. Every song is top notch! I really like &#34;Drinking from the Bottle&#34; because the radio doesn't play it often. And if you listen closely, you could hear Tinie Tempah's signature &#34;YEA!&#34; and &#34;Whoo&#34; after the verse &#34;I could pay everything that's on you.&#34; Anyways, buy this album if you like mainstream EDM. Calvin Harris is amazing at creating music with intense beat-breaks.

B00ADQPB50|5.0|This season is much different than the last, as far as story line. Still crazy and twisted, but they took it to the next level. The first few episodes were a bit confusing, but if you pay attention, it,s all coming together nicely. If you don't like crazy, gore, and disturbing things, DON'T watch. If you do, the this IS the show for you. It's demented, twisted, wild characters, a lot of crazy things you could see from asylums from around 1960. Things were much different then, and we mostly tried to hide the crazy people from society. Anyway, I love the show, can't wait to finish out the season, and see what next season brings!

B009WO7NQO|2.0|My kids were SO excited for this game. First time I ever bought a &#34;premium&#34; edition instead of a free one, because they were so excited for it. WHAT A MISTAKE. They beat all the levels on the game in a couple of hours! There's only a few that are &#34;free&#34; in the game I PAID FOR!!!! You have to pay for additional levels. Also the game is not even complete. An update is coming soon. An update in a brand new game? Wait till it is complete then release it. I will never get a paid version of any other rovio game. The free ones are better than this ripoff. One positive note, what game there is is cute, and kids did enjoy all two hours of play.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|A Wanted Man is the latest entry in Lee Child's incredible Jack Reacher series. Instead of being a thrilling piece of literature it comes off as a convoluted story filled with too many plot twists and over complicated story points.<br /><br />It starts off simple enough as it picks right were \\"Worth Dying For\\" left off with Reacher looking to catch a ride to Virginia to meet up with Susan, the voice on the phone that he spoke to in \\"61 Hours\\". He gets picked up by a group of people in a car and while all seems well, he quickly realizes that not everything is as it seems.<br /><br />The story changes genre's maybe half a dozen times throughout the story. First its about a kidnapping, then its an international incident, then its about a rescue mission then a covert operation and finally it becomes a revenge mission. The twists get so overdone in the book that it becomes frustrating to read and by the time you are two thirds of the way through the book it no longer remotely resembles the story that began. Its incredibly convoluted and overdone and to me its definitely one of the weaker Reacher novels I have read.<br /><br />Plus Childs' use of cliffhangers to end his chapters becomes ridiculous. He has a lot of chapters in the book, some very small, and it feels like each one of them has to end with a misdirecting cliffhanger that leads to eye rolling when you read the next chapter.  It becomes laughable after a certain point because most of them wind up being an outright lie by Childs or some kind of deception to get you to go \\"wtf\\" and get you to read on only to have it be not at all what Childs was describing. Case in point, late in the novel, Reacher comes face to face with a character. The last line of the chapter is Reacher saying that he is standing in front of a character who has already died in the novel. You start to freak out and turn the page. You read the next chapter and the very first line is Reacher saying that it actually isn't that character. That happens about 100 times in A Wanted Man and it makes you want to throw your book across the room.<br /><br />Its not all bad though. Even being one of the weaker novels I've read its still pretty good. It introduces a great sidekick, a female FBI agent named Sorenson who is working the midnight shift when she gets the call about a dead body found inside of a warehouse that eventually leads her to Reacher. It takes a while for Reacher to get physical this time around, but when he does this time it feels especially good while your reading it. Reacher gives them the hard goodbye and he does it in some of the more entertaining situations I have seen from him. Childs also writes great humor for Reacher. He is always doing risk assessment of situations in his head throughout the book (throughout the series) and he intentionally puts others in danger in order to minimize the risk to himself. Their is a point when Reacher is with Sorenson and another agent and they are going to rush into a house where they think the bad guys are. Reacher calculates in his head that the most dangerous place to enter would be to go in through the front door. Without hesitating he announces he is going in through the back door and lets Sorenson go in through the front door.<br /><br />Reacher is a great character and I love how Childs has created this walking, talking nomadic incarnation of true justice. He is almost like a karmic Terminator who only cares about making sure that people who do wrong get what they deserve. When Reacher is on the case, justice is always served whether in the courts or on the streets. Thats why I love the characters. Even though I consider this to be a lesser entry in the series it still gets 3 stars.pens about 100 times in A Wanted Man and it makes you want to throw your book across the room.<br /><br />Its not all bad though.

The whole premise just sucks you in: a treasure hunt in a Matrix-like game that references almost everything in 80's pop culture. I was sold from paragraph three onward when it quotes Ghostbusters. Buy this book; it doesn't disappoint.

0393061310|5.0|&#34;History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among  peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.&#34;<br /><br />What do Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Francisco Pizarro have in common? Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it's no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.<br /><br />In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?<br /><br />Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to &#34;an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable&#34; (p. 408).<br /><br />To Diamond's great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.<br /><br />As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).<br /><br />&#34;Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia's having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.&#34; (p. 163).<br /><br />Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.<br /><br />&#34;The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia's Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world's 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.&#34; (p. 139).<br /><br />Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.<br /><br />To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.<br /><br />In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.<br /><br />The Invisible Ally<br /><br />For all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of humanhistory: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.<br /><br />In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.<br /><br />As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br /><br />One of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist, hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.<br /><br />I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. This makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.creases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure.

B0099116AY|5.0|I took my mom and sister to see this.  Purposely put my sister between me and my mom (I had read it was more drama than comedy. And I had heard about the theater scene). Within 5 minutes I was choking up.  Don't get me wrong, there are times of absolute hilarity, the audience was roaring with laughter at a lot of scenes.  However, it just struck me as a more realistic portrayal of life. Honest.  Everyone's hopes, dreams, wishes.....and the inevitable feeling of those dreams drifting away.  But then resulting in a journey of acceptance and love. For me it was an emotional kick in the gut. Maybe that's just me.  But this film made me a blubbering idiot.  If you have parents that are getting up there in age, and you are feeling this creeping up on yourself as well, fair warning. Do not let this film bypass you. Meryl Streep tore at my heart. Amazing, seemingly effortless work by her. Yes, her again.  For those who criticize her work as being too, for lack of a better word, \\"studied\\" or \\"educated\\", you can throw that out the window with this. Just her facial expressions killed me, no words, just an everyday person's feelings flowing across her face. So realistic.  Tommy Lee Jones---hilarious, heartbreaking, a performance that was every bit as realistic.  He was awesome.  Even though I had tears running down my face practically the entire time, I'm getting this DVD.  Can't wait to see it again---but in the privacy of my own home---where no one can see me balling my eyes out.  I'm a wuss.  Rating: A

She's send back to her home town of Wind Gap from Chicago by her boss to cover the murder of one little girl and the disappearance of another girl for the newspaper at which she works. Camille spent some time in a mental hospital after her cutting was discovered, which all stems from her seriously dysfunctional childhood. Now back under her mother's roof, she realizes there is a whole lot more wrong in Wind Gap than she ever imagined.<br /><br />`Sharp Objects' sucks you in quickly and by the end, you are dazed and shocked by the events within. I read this book in one sitting and I was amazed at how deftly Ms. Flynn captured not only the soul of a small town, but the deeper chasms of mental illness and brought the characters to startling life against a seemingly bucolic setting. `Sharp Objects' makes you wonder if you really know anyone at all...<br /><br />Ms. Flynn has written a scarily realistic, wickedly twisted, and psychologically terrifying first novel in `Sharp Objects'.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Snow White and the Huntsman combines a rarity of high caliber acting, special effects and animation.  Charlize Theron renders a spectacular performance throughout.  Kristen Steward also delivers a quality performance.  Bob Hoskins, as always, portrays an excellent character performance.  The movie is engaging, suspenseful and well scripted.  Special effects and animation are also well-done, but do not detract from the live acting.  I rented this, re-watched it and then purchased it.

0451205766|5.0|In our age, there could be found two economies in a nation: one that runs with public sanction and the other that runs underground. Both these economies have their own dons who run these economies and who influence the environment of their respective economies. How these economies got created is a matter of research, and whether the underground economies can ever be curbed is a matter of debate. What the book does is, it beautifully, logically brings forth both the economies at close quarters and allows their values to interact.<br /><br />I read the book long time back and the only characters i remember from the book are Don Corleone and Michael. The reason i remember them is because of their diametrically opposite economies they abide in. It seems, Mario Puzo had a rather pessimistic point of view of the economies that run with public sanction, because in the end Michael joins the underground economy. I personally do not share Mario's pessimism. However, i would still give it highest rating i could because- the characters were aptly portrayed, the writing style is lucid, the plot is engrossing, and more importantly because Mario brings forth various social malice such as pedophilia (remember the angel child in the lobby?)<br /><br />Apart from the ephemeral pleasure derived from reading a good novel, social malice, such as mentioned above, that propagate in broad daylight should make a reader think whether there is any difference in an underground Mafia economy and an \\"overground\\" economy. Because, in both the economies the only parameter that counts is money. If it is the money that defines values in both the economies, then what is difference in these two economies In this regard, i feel \\"The Godfather\\" would outlive its age as every age would have to face the social malice and the hypocrisy Mario has so effectively depicted.<br /><br />Pravin Ashok Sarode<br />[[ASIN:B008F4TOKK Once upon a time in the land of Jasmine Revolution and some short stories]]
B00129H7VS|5.0|I wanted it for a long time. The picture is very clear and the sound is great. My family realy enjoy it!<br />The case is wonderful!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app makes facebook fun and easy. Stay in touch with your friends and family at the tip of your  finger tips.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|You can't go wrong with anything Garth Brookes.  It was nice to have all of his hits in one 2 disc collection
B008CRC506|5.0|I loved the whole season from the start to the end. It has excellent acting and singers. Katharine McPhee was just great. She should have won American Idol but she has won even more by getting this show.  Anjelica Huston was outstanding in her part. Debra Messing was the best Actor in the whole show, she has been great. I hope she sings more in the next season. Megan Hilty was a wonderful surprise as an actress and an actor. I never had seen her before but I know she was in Wicked and other Musicals but she was very exciting to watch to see what she would do next, and did it well. ALL the actors were so good. I understand they have fired many of the other actors and the writer for the next season but I know it will be better and more music I understand. Thanks Steven Spielberg for Producing this show great idea.<br />The Original music was so good. This was about Marilyn Monroe the Musical and when they got it done I wish it was a real musical because I would love to watch it live. They did an excellent job putting it all together.<br />I cant wait until the next season and hope it goes on forever. There has never ben anything like it.<br />It is going to be difficult to match the first season but I hear it will be better from reading about it. I give it 5+ stars for the originality and the Music as well as the acting. Of coarse the story too. Thanks for the show.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Nothing like the movie.  I enjoyed all of the twist and turns.  I never knew Holmes was so brilliant until I read this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Omg this is such a great game! I cant stop playing it!!You should get it!!Even all of my family plays it!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a really funny story about a quirky 100-year old man who manages to get into some riotous situations. It's also a humorous romp through history.<br />I've recommended this to several others who have also enjoyed it.<br />Plus, it's a demonstration that if a publisher sells eBooks at a reasonable price more people would buy them. Otherwise I would have purchased a paperback and just loaned it to others.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Wanted to like it. Hated it! Top notch acting but boring and ridiculous. Put together like a suspense thriller but ended up being an artsy blah.
B000001BZT|5.0|Love this and every other Steve Earle album. A classic. Sometimes gritty, sometimes beautiful. Never get tired of Copperhead Road.
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|Super sharp picture unlike when I first watched them on tv.  Now with a big flat screen and now in HD.  Great story and average to high replay value.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille can't write books fast enough to satisfy my hunger for them.  Great character in John Corey, he could go on and on with it and I'd never get bored.  Funny wit but so smart.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|It came professionally packaged and looks quite durable.  I was excited that the cable length was some 18 feet, reducing requirement for wireless transmitter/receiver when doing on-camera interviews<br /><br />Connected it to the Tascam DR-40 after making all necessary settings on the Tascam.  All the sound that could come out was switching the mic on/off or blowing directly into it.  Otherwise, no voice could be heard.  Tried it on a laptop & PC.  I had to shout to hear anything.<br /><br />I thought the supplied LR-44 battery was dead.  Got a new one, but the same story prevailed.  Sadly, cost of returning it is not worth the cost of acquiring it.
B001FZ0A2C|5.0|Great record.  I'm becoming a huge Husker Du fan, 25 years after the fact.  Guess better late than never.  Vinyl sound prestine!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|One of the best Batman movies I've seen along with an Academy Award winning cast. The ending was especially good!
0393064476|5.0|An important book for anyone who wants to know more about historical change yet very readable. One of the year's best books. Many new ideas about European history
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Don't miss out on this story.  You are steered towards the ending which doesn't leave you wanting. I recommend this to Grisham fans and those who have not read him.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I'm really glad I decided to buy the whole album. It comes in a cardboard case but I don't have any complaints.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I was looking for a game of solitaire, and finally came across this one after purchasing a few others that weren't as good.  What I like about this game is that it gives you choices for themes and game play.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's great and it works! I love how it tells me how many hours away the alarm is because I can calculate how many hours of sleep, studying, exercise, etc. I've been doing.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I was greatly disappointed in the language content of this movie especially after preparing myself for a good family story.
B007SSDS24|4.0|Very entertaining, makes you think of what would happen in these kids [people] shoes in the situation they are in, scary at parts and lots of entertainment - keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B002BWP49C|5.0|My DVD arrived quickly and in great condition! The wording on the DVD box was in both French and English which was a little unusual but the movie itself was in English.  I have no complaints and I recommend this seller.
B000ID37RM|5.0|The movie and the book are wonderful, a true story and Gregory Peck gives the movie the right touch of being a true father, an honest man, a very good lawyer and peace [fairness to all].<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who either enjoys a very good 'history/heritage' type of quality and also who enjoys the actor Gregory Peck.<br /><br />a Must See for all ages to learn about the time when the black people and women had no rights at all.  All White men ruled the time period.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As an avid reader and self-proclaimed book connoisseur, I was a bit skeptical but decided to purchase this book after reading several stellar reviews on dreamindemon.com -which happens to be the best crimeentertainment blog I've come across and I believe that Howey was at one point a writer for the morbid and often hilarious site. This book is outstanding, the characters of this book have an amazing depth to them even though you only know some for a short time and combined with the intense and thought provoking plot, it's almost impossible to put down.  Hugh Howey is truly a master of his craft; this book is one of the best I've read and I strongly encourage anyone looking at this to give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My sons won't get off playing this game.  It's a true babysitter.  Keeps them playing together it was a great buy Thanks a bunch!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I love this game! I have played it many times and it is still challenging. the premium version is the best.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Well, this was the App of the Day and looked pretty good so I ordered it. Tried to open it in the appstore on my Droid and it just sat there \\"downloading\\" for about 2 days then it disappeared altogether never to be found again. Guess it really is in the Lost City.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|One of the all-time greats! This movie is great, especially for the over-50 group. Good acting (does it get better than Maggie Smith and Judi Densch?  There's hope in this world after all.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great story, follows book wonderfully!  Love that this story does not follow a predictable road.  Exciting, fantastic, suspenseful and thrilling!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I read all of Nelson Demille's books. I like the John Corey character especially in The Lion  and Wild Fire. I thought he was up to his usual smart mouth comments that make me laugh, but I didn't like the plot. I found myself getting bored and it wasn't the page turner that Demille  usually writes.I found the book long and boring in some parts. Ofcourse John Corey comes through in the end. It was just okay.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Wonderful game.  I got this game to see what all the fuss about Angry Birds was about, now I see.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's not the best written work; but the plot and the flow of the books make up for the lack of quality. Would definitely read it again.
1616614609|5.0|This is now my go to competitive one on one card game.  It blows Magic the Gathering out of the water and best of all it's an LCG.  It'll expand every month and it's super cheap to stay current with.
0307593525|5.0|I gave this book set as a gift to a friend that does a lot of cooking. He loves the set.
B0091REZMW|4.0|They don't give you as many things to find in your quests as they do in the Facebook app but I still enjoy playing it while waiting for appointments.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great story lines.  Really enjoy the continuity from generation to generation and the interrelationships among members of different families.  The characters are well developed, interesting and exciting.  Also a lot of interesting history.  Compares well to Ken Follett's other epic novels, &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and &#34;World Without End&#34;.  Look forward to the third book of the trilogy.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|just watch the price. I got them pretty cheap thru amazon and in great cond. It was worth it! So go ahead and get them too!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The story continues with amazing imagination! You think nothing more horrible can happen than what Katniss & Peeta went thru  and then they have the Quell.great story
B003ZSJ212|4.0|just in blu-ray format. Maybe one day, &#34;they&#34; will add the 70's movies with the &#34;updated&#34; ones. One can only hope! Go ahead and get them before they add &#34;Disney&#34; to it, it'll be a item soon
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know where to begin on how to review. I absolutely love it. This series is definitely going to be on my guilty pleasures list.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|If you like Sci-fi/space movies, you should like this.  I wont get into the details, like others have posted and reviwed. I'm sure you're not reading this one just to see if I liked it or not. I recommend, always, put the movie in the cart, and keep an eye on the price..you'll get a good deal, even if its a buck or two
B005Q1W10A|5.0|In this DVD of season 2 you see more from the characters you know... lots of new developments, and nobody's happy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game. It makes you think and its fun. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thought not quite as on the edge of my seat as some of Grisham's works, The Racketeer kept me guessing right up to the end.
1451675046|5.0|This book has become one of my favorites, it really gave me some &#34;wow, so that's how it works!&#34; moments.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Continuing his trilogy, we meet people we have met before and some new ones intertwined; and we review history as we thought we knew it.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I started watching this show when it premired on tv. And I have hated having to wait a whole year before the sweason is avalible on Netflix, becuase I dont have this chanel on my tv. And now I can watch the newest episwodes without going threw major withdrawls!
0140620516|5.0|very cool book. was actua;l;ly enjoyable to read and follow along. thank u guys very much 4 the cool book
067144901X|5.0|I loved this story as I read it to my children and now I have the opportunity to read it to my great niece and it still makes me smile!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Got this on a sale for $20, no brainer.  Theatrical and collector's cuts of the films with tons of extras.  Alien in blu-ray...amazing.  Ridley Scott is a genius.
0689835604|4.0|A cute story for a little child.  The baby laughs as we read the story to her.  The kids like to lift the flap as we read.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Keeps you wanting  more!!! One of the best series I have seen in a long time. Five stars for sure!!!
0805047905|5.0|As a teacher, Brown Bear, Brown Bear... is a classic that all children read by the 1st grade if not before.  Why not start the kids out with a great board book!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It is the greatest trilogy ever, enough said. Nolan's Batman series is a great cinematic masterpiece, enjoy it. Batman trilogy rises above the rest. Can't wait to watch this endlessly.
0525953728|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I learned a lot that I was not aware of and found it so intriguing.  I would rather get the &#34;real&#34; info from someone who was there than from the so-call &#34;media&#34; who no one can believe anymore.  I am also glad that the proceeds are going to a very good cause.  Hooyah!!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Wonderful story, beautiful scenery, great actors. Made me emotional and got me thinking. I loved it. It's a must see movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the only problem I have with it is that in creative mode you cant use Tnt its pros out weigh the cons one of my most used games
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am very happy that I downloaded this game. It is so much fun; keeps me busy at the doctors office. :)
B004KAB43I|5.0|Working with this seller was great.  I was a little dissapointed that my book had a different cover than the one displayed but it was still the correct book and arrived in a timely manner.
B00197U13Y|5.0|This album is an awesome example of sonic gorgeousness. Listening to it on vinyl completely transcends anything you can imagine!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very nice game! Keeps me busy for hours at a time. Don't know what I'd do with out it.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|An OK story. I didn't know it would be so light on the mystery and too heavy on an instant romance. The characters have possibilities for further development. The old ladies have great potential. I think this author has the ability to develop more complex and lengthier plots. Most mystery fans don't mind some romance but if that was paramount, we'd read romances, not mysteries. Still, all in all it was a decent read. If they get more complex, I will probably read more.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read. Couldn't put the book down.<br />Quick, easy, and entertaining for all ages.<br />Looking forward for Catching Fire movie.
B00742F4W6|4.0|The set is over all pretty good the best part is the video collection they could have done better with the cds like put all of the remixs in this set but the ones they have in here are really good picks. It also comes with a photo book and a cross with the rammstein logo if you can get this edition it is worth it
B001UW58WW|5.0|David Garrett has a mastery of the violin that few people have ever attained.  His blend of classical violin with contemporary music is fresh and wonderful to listen to.  I am a fan!
034547581X|5.0|I received this item before Christmas, and the person loved the gift.<br />Great job!  I recommend this to anyone who want's this book!
B0037QGS0A|4.0|Always a fan of Amanda Seyfried!!  Interesting plot and not something that I would have expected but enjoyable none the less.  Movie also has one of the hottest R rated scenes of all movies today.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I rated this book because I like it and it has many big words I need to know. I like everything in it.
B0026S1XD2|5.0|Awesome musician.  Mike Oldfield brings energy and creativity to rock like few artists are capable of doing.  What a great albume.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|Like some of the other reviewers I don't quite understand where all of the great rankings are coming from on this one. I found this book just about useless if you actually want to learn how to cook.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|What can I say, ABBA is the number 1 pop band of all times.  This disc set gives you ALL of their studio albums in one nice neat package.  Who could ask for anything more?
1449410243|5.0|This is something that every cat and non cat owner can find Hilarius i recommend to every one to buy a copy
B008YJFDQK|5.0|I'm a huge Ben Harper fan, so having his favorite slow songs in one compilation is a treat. It's nice knowing if we agree on certain songs or not -- and we mostly do. This is perfect for either a long time fan like myself, who has way too many albums to sift through to find that &#34;perfect&#34; song, or even someone who really doesn't know him well, but is a fan of low-key songs.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We love The Big Bang Theory and always order each  season's episodes as they come out. We never get tired of the humor.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Give me a chance to read it!!  So far, almost half way through it is almost as good as Rebus in his prime.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I was not prepared for the emotional punch of this film. Cinema has the ability to reach beyond the surface of the human mind. Yes, there are wolves. There are plane crashes... fire, snow, and blood. But there is so much more.<br />If you like Malicks work... or even Refns \\"Drive\\" you will love this film. Get it on baby blu and enjoy the day.
B007HACDLK|5.0|By way of disclosure I am an unabashed Vince Flynn fan and have read every one of the Mitch Rapp series.  As has been the case in the entire series the character development and the pacing are top notch.  Every time I read one in this series I wonder how much is fiction and how much is what happens in the dark world of the CIA.  If you haven't read one of Flynn's books do yourself a favor and try one - you'll like it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Great game, but almost unusable because of how the ads are displayed on the kindle fire. I had to remove it from my device.
B0000W3N7K|4.0|A good album with some early work (whic was their best).  Worth the purchase if you get it for a good price.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|This is by far the worst Transformers movie that I have ever seen.  I am glad I did not see this movie in the theaters nor bought this stupid movie.  The scenes are so discombobulated and do not flow well together at all.  The only one thing that could have deemed this movie is absent namely: Megan Fox vs. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.  I keep watching this movie hoping it will get better but so far it is still awful.  No more Michael Bay Transformer movies.  I think the only way to redeem the Transformer name is to return to an animated movie.  I recommend everyone to watch the animated Transformer movie and the original tv series released in the 80's.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Almost finished reading this book # 3. Sure makes you wonder about what poeple are capable of doing. It is fiction and scary entertainment.
B0027BVMSY|3.0|Casino Royale was better. I equate Bond with classy action, nice car, leading woman. none of these were in Quantum of Solace. I heard Skyfall is better than QofS.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has a huge imagination with a huge helping of shock and awe. This is a very entertaining book that keeps you wondering even at the end.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Fast read, It kept my attention. Had watched HBO series and still found it entertaining and engrossing. Recommend it heartily.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Again this is a thriller beyond the end of the book. This story twists, turns and hits you with surprise after surpise. Enjoy!!
B009CPES4I|4.0|How much of a challange it is to grow old and still hold on to what we love most in life!
1419705849|5.0|I really enjoyed this book but I hate the way Amazon reduces its UK taxes. Step up and pay what you owe Amazon.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This is really easy to use, I wanted something to crop the pictures in the kindle fire and this app does it quickly and gives you more to play with. Worth the cost.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|They shoud have indicate that this book doesn't display propery for kindle touch.<br />I had to returned it!! What a dissapointing for amazon kindle management
B001543L92|5.0|It arrived before the expected date. I loved. I was afraid that it stoped in the custum house, here in Brazil, but it didn't, so I'm happy :D
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i'llthis app works really well. i really like the solving math problems they really help me wake up in the morning Me wake
B00004THAY|5.0|Been wanted to get this for awhile, it is a gift, but I am sure the person will enjoy it. Thanks for ariving on time.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Talk about momma bear for real.  Great story to watch together for mom & daughter.  Teen years are so hard to get through...this movie really speaks to that relationship and the strain it can go through.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Believe it or not, my expectations were astronomical and Christopher Nolan exceeded them. I went into this movie expecting a phenomenal film and what I got was the conclusion to a trilogy that I can only compare to the likes of Lord of the Rings (LOTR) and the original 3 Star Wars (SW). Although, not even reletively similar in how the movies play (compared to LOTR and SW), the dark knight trilogy is one of the best 3 trilogies of all time. I consider the 3rd Godfather reason enough to put the Godfather trilogy 4th by a considerable margin compared to the three I just referenced. In terms of all three movies being one complete story, The best trilogy(s) of all time are as followed:<br /><br />1) Lord of the Rings<br />2) Batman/Dark Knight (Nolan)<br />3) Star War's<br />4) Godfather<br />5) Bourne, Indiana Jones, Terminaor, pirates, etc... (most are more than a trilogy now).<br /><br />Obviously, the above list is exponentially subjective but I feel as it accurately depicts at least by a rough estimate, the top choices for any individual to  create their own list, and in their own order.<br /><br />Anyway's The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is such a must-see film, I won't get into any detail whatsoever about any of the movie. Based on my favorite movies, you can decide if your taste is like mine at all; then make the determination on whether you want to see TDKR. I am not a great critic, as I found zero flaw's in the movie but I do love movies... a lot. So basically, I like all Leonardo movies after titanic, Christopher Nolan is the favorite Director (due to Memento, Inception, The Prestige). I am also a huge Martin Scorsese fan (obviously, every movie he's ever done btw) and David Fincher as well (Fight Club, Dragon Tattoo, The Game, Social Network, Seven, and many, many more) I like the Iron Man movies more than every other superhero movie besides TDKR. Big time Shawshank fan, huge The Town fan, loved Enemy of the State (and most of Will Smith's stuff). I like QuentonTarantino and think his upcoming Danjo Unchained is going to be awesome. Not a huge Matrix fan which is strange with my other movie preferences. Obviously the whole Hanibal Lector series, I'm a big fan of Green Street Hooligans, big fan of Robert DeNiro and most of the stuff he's been in too. I am a comedy fan but more a fan of a bad*** movie like TDKR. To give a more specific preference, I give The Departed the nod for my favorite movie of all-time. TDKR is up there, - top 10. I actually put both, The Dark Knight (TDK) and TDKR in my top 10 movies ever made. Only other movie series on that kind of level is The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is my first review of a movie... ever. So I essesntially just listed my preferences for a good movie, and TDKR certainly fits that mold.  I highly reccommend TDKR to anyone, but certainly someone who has taste for any of the forementioned films on my &#34;preference list&#34;. Well, I don't know if this will help you but I gave it my best shot. If you read this, good for you... now you know what kind of movie's I like and got a good reccommendation for a great film. If you stopped reading after the first few sentences, also great... move on, do big things, im outta hereeeeee. watch TDKR!!!!!!!!
B00656C6KK|5.0|The CD was great. Her voice is timeless.  I so wish she would do something so we could SEE her.  What a wonderful woman she is.
B001UJE97K|5.0|purchased this for my son he was excited to receive it very promptly.  he has gotten a great deal of use out of it
B00479SVBU|5.0|excellent product, great sounds. convenient to put usb, sd card in. but when i connect this to my itouch and cellphone, the sound is not great. probably directly connect to car audio will get better sounds.
B000W74EQC|5.0|this DVD finished my collection and I was pleased to have it.  Loved all the movies and would recommend them to all

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was very good !! I cried a lot , the things that happened to her will change the way you think altogether . If only certain people did their jobs accurately they could have helped her ???  I would  definitely recommend this one !!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved the history in the story line.  Could not put the book down. Strongly recommend book to other avid readers!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Es una buena opción para Kindle, además tiene la función de reproducir varios tipos de archivo multimedia, Yo lo utilizo por ejemplo para escuchar música que tengo en Sugarsync.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is really exciting and different. I watched the first 2 seasons in a weekend. Make sure you have a strong stomach.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie with fun characters.  Good for my boys ages 9 and up.  Relax and have a great movie night with the whole family.
B001I45UFC|5.0|the chronicles of narnia is my all time favorite book. In the story four children edmund susan peter and lucy are sent away to the country because of world war two. They are sent to live with an old professer and his mean maid. The house is huge and while exploring lucy find a wardrobe that is the start of an adenture.
B00005OM4N|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN U SAY HERE.........U GOTTA LOVEEEEEEEEEE HER AND HER SONGS I KNOW I DO HAHA =) SPEARS, SPEARS, SPEARS.....HAHA
B001GMH8SI|5.0|THIS FILM IS WHAT LIFE SHOULD BE ABOUT. I BELIEVE THIS GUY AND HIS ACTIONS SPEAK VOLUMES. I WISH THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD WATCH THIS AND BELIEVE. NOT A WASTE OF TIME TO WATCH OR MONEY TO BUY! BEAUTIFUL…
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|I loved this movie! It keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />I just didn't like the fact the streaming kept cutting out right at the good parts of the movie.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|A must have in your collection! The blu-ray quality is the best way to view this masterpiece! I recomend this and I recomend Amazon!
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Oh how this woman can SING!!! We need many more recordings of this stellar star and they can't come fast enough.
B007SGM084|4.0|i bought all 3 at once so there would be no lag in reading.  Enjoyed the book. Realistically could of been 1 book but i understand there is more money to be made when split into 3.  The twist was good.  Overall, I did enjoy the book.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I didn't find this book to be masterfully written or the different stories elaborately woven.  I was forcing myself to finish because it was too late to turn back.  Toward the end, I thought maybe it would pay off because somehow, the stories would come together and reveal something.  That didn't happen.  This might be one of those rare cases where the movie might be better than the book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|moved a little slow at start, but picked up then. not as good as last book.john grisham always comes thru tho.
B00A2H9NZY|5.0|Well done! Can't wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray! I am so glad that I got to see this movie on the big screen.  It didn't stay in the theaters very long.  Too bad for that since it was a beautiful, inspiring, humorous, emotional (a few tears) and well done movie about surfing and relationships. If you only like coastal northern California's beautiful scenery and wave action that would be enough to enjoy this movie. Add the real life story line of a father-son mentorship of Frosty Hesson and Jay Moriarity and this become so much more. My friends and family loved this movie.  Gerard Butler did a fantastic job in portraying Frosty and braved huge waves to show audiences the powerful, dangerous side of surfing.....he almost drowned during the filming. This movie deserves multiple viewings and will make a great gift.  Hope the DVD has a lot of extras attached!<br /><br />March 4, 2013........Well it is a few months later and I finally received the Bluray! Absolute blown away with the photography, sound and extraordinary effort in making this movie.  The Incredible extra features have made this movie even better than watching it the first time!
B001E5CH0G|5.0|In terms of nontraditional, deranged holiday classics, \\"Elf\\" is right at the top of a very short list (\\"Bad Santa\\" also makes the list, though you should definitely keep your children as far away as possible from THAT one!). Will Ferrell is at his best here, and James Caan is right there with him. Zoey Deshcanel's performance is likewise stellar, and perhaps the best of her career. The story, while being utterly absurd, also does a remarkably fine job of capturing the magic of the Christmas spirit, and this is definitely a \\"feel good\\" movie. And the absurdity of the plot is by no means a detriment- it is, in fact, what makes \\"Elf\\" so unique and so very, very amusing.<br /><br />I can guarantee you one thing- you have not enjoyed a proper, 21st century Christmas, if you have not yet watched a man who is six feet tall prancing about in tights and pointy shoes, eating marshmallows and sugary sweets at all hours, declaring that \\"smiling is his favorite\\".
B005UDD1R6|4.0|When I first got my kindle fire, I was fretting about how to watch my personal videos. luckily someone had mentioned this app and so I downloaded it. i was able to watch my first movie on it last night. it was WALL-E, and it was great picture quality and everything. i am still trying to figure out volume issues...not sure if its based on the video quality or not. Either way, i love this app.
0061733199|5.0|I've recently taken an interest in wanting to learn about overnight hiking trips, and as a requirement i need to learn about surviving in the wilds and being able to rescue myself. This book has been highly rated thus far so I decided to give it a try. I do not regret it! The color illustrations are extremely helpful to me, being a very visual learning person and artist. It doesn't overwork anything it teaches and just keeps things short, sweet and to the point. Very helpful. I haven;t finished reading the whole thing yet, but what i have read so far has been extremely helpful. I recommend it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|best game on the market. can't wait for the next one. one downside , I've beat every level with perfection but others have higher rankings than have I, very irksome.
0634022296|5.0|If you want to sing and play all your Beatles favorites this is the song book for you.  Easy to read chords and words...hours and hours of fun!!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Sony used to make this model, only collapsible.  If these headphones could fold up I would give it 6 stars.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|I bought this product after researching other similar products from DragonFly and turtlebeach and finally ended up buying this. I am happy with this product. The best thing about Fiio7 is that its not an amplifier only for products connected to your computer. I regularly use this amplifier for my car audio too. The BASS is great. You would surely see a difference in the audio quality along with good BASS and amplification. I would recommend this product to anyone who watches videos/movies using their headphones and would love to get a home theater effect. I use this amplifier with my Sennheiser HD 280 pro to get premium sound experience.
B009P5K4HK|5.0|These is some of her early performances and those of us who adore her can compare the original versions to songs on Black to Black. The sadness of Amy Winehouse's untimely death is truly a tragedy for those of us who adore her voice and talent.
B003XX2PD6|5.0|just to say this is a terrific sound. fresh and confident. i am adding more words to conform to product review requirements.<br /><br />Ed Askew
0062183591|4.0|I recently had the pleasure of reading this book as part of my graduate studies as a student in the Carlow University Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics program while enrolled in the course \\"Forensic Research and Analysis.[...]<br /><br />As a member of the law enforcement community, this book provided me with some \\"outside the box\\" views on how and when an individual may engage in cheating, fraud or deception. The author highlighted various experiments that showed how individuals who cheat will follow through with their actions on a solo level, with a partner, and while working in a group atmosphere.  These experiments have provided me with additional tools that I will use while interviewing suspects involved in fraudulent activity.<br /><br />The author's ability to address the topic of cheating by detailing the outcomes of his studies through a direct approach assisted in eliminating any weaknesses in his presentation of the subject matter. This allows the reader the opportunity to apply the topics to their field of study and/or current profession.<br /><br />I have been investigating fraudulent crimes and financial crimes for over ten years and the concepts and theories presented by Dan Ariely provide a foundation for anyone entering the world of fraud and forensics. The author supplies the reader with easy to understand ideas and explanations that can be expanded upon as an entry-level person in the field of white collar crimes applies them to real life investigations.
0345529057|5.0|This book has everything you would like to see in a fantasy book.  Without wanting to spoiling anything, I would simply say don't fall in love with the characters, though Martin does everything to make you want to.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I did not get a chance to see this show when it was near my location, very glad they recorded a show for BR release.  This is one if not my favorite concert BR or DVD that I have and I have many.<br /><br />The band is tight, the picture is beautiful and the sound is amazing.<br /><br />Do not miss this release!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a marathon type DVD - you won't want to leave the tv until you finish it.  Can't wait for the next 3 version.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn and Mitch Rapp just keep getting better. Can't wait for the next episode, hopefully it won't be a year.
1449410243|5.0|I purchased this book for a friend's birthday.  She adopted a shelter cat recently.  The title of the book caught my eye and it was perfect for her.  Very clever and funny pictures and writing!  She enjoyed the book very much.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Challenging to get a good landing but the controls and display are a good interface. I haven't gotten very far but I would recommend this.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|I liked the song and listen to this cd sometimes. I like the song about treating me like a stranger or something.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Addicting game for a while but there are just so many levels I started to play some other things. This is a neat change up from something like Sudoku and you'll have plenty of puzzle levels to keep you busy.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|This is one of the best games out there.  It's very well thought out, perfectly mimicking the Yahtzee games I played as kid.  Dice is such a traditional, fun game, but this app brings it to a whole new level.  I've been playing with all of my Facebook friends and they are now just as addicted as me!
B0090YHSFC|3.0|Silly little game, works fine but glad I got it on the free app of the day, wouldn't be happy if I had paid for it.
031620157X|5.0|This book was wonderful and I adore Chris Colfer's writing style. Perfect for all ages. While parts of the story may not be very original, it's still intriguing for those who love fairy tales like I do.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|It is a great backpack for junior or senior university student. It has a professional look and enough room for everything a student need to move around while at university. It is also a comfortable bag for travel.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|This book gives me a chance to expand my viewpoint and translate the facts from various kinds of perspectives eventually enables me to get a bird eye over things.
1451695187|4.0|I found this story compelling. The shared science behind brain function were helpful to understand the writer's experience, and not overwhelming for the lay person. The personal impact on loved ones devastated by the sudden onset of an unexpected coma keeps the reader grounded and the story moving forward. The spiritual experiences were fascinating but left you wanting more. My only caution is that this is a very fast read, and I wished it were a longer story. Perhaps we will hear more from Dr. Alexander at a later date.
B0084I9QI2|4.0|This album brings back wonderful memories of the late 1980's when music was real and fun and MJ was unstoppable. My favs are \\"I Just Cant Stop Loving You\\", Another Part Of Me\\" and \\"Liberian Girl\\". The outtakes are fantastic, especially \\"Song Groove\\", \\"Free\\" and \\"StreetWalker\\". I dont know how these songs did not make the original album, they would have been massive hits i believe.[[ASIN:1448922070 The Joy of Magic]]
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Great quality and shipped fast. I would highly rec this to anyone who enjoys movies and especially blu ray dvd
B0034CNSFU|5.0|This is the most intriguing and magical musician I have ever seen and heard. Timeless classics in this collection. \\"All Along The Watchtower\\", \\"Little Wing\\", \\"Manic Depression\\", all breathtaking guitar driven sonic gems. Jimi Hendrix is the best thing ever!!![[ASIN:1448922070 The Joy of Magic]]
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love this game. Play it every day on my kindle and my phone. I would recommend this game to anyone who can play.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Just wanted to let people know that Godzilla on 'Some Enchanted Evening' is a totally different version than the original.  Much shorter, and doesn't have the spoken intro.  FYI.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Solid end to a good series.  If you liked the other two you'll probably like this one.  It is fairly long, but worth it.
0375703861|5.0|When \\"White Teeth\\" was published, it got a lot of buzz about taking on race, immigration, religion, politics, etc.  Sounded like a drag, to be honest.<br /><br />But after reading \\"On Beauty,\\" which was less popular (but I loved)I decided to give White Teeth a try.  It turned out to be a fast read with an abundance of fleshed out characters (although some remain rather one dimensional) and the \\"Themes\\" of racism, assimilation, etc, don't hit you over the head with an \\"ASSIMILATION IS BAD\\" message.  If I have any quibble, it's that the white characters are never developed.<br /><br />Well, not the only quibble.  The ending is a mild let down, and the epilogue should really have just been edited out, but it is still a five star book that made me laugh, made me think, and totally made me care about the characters. After I read it, I gave it to a friend and we are still talking about it.<br /><br />Finally, I hope I don't get banned for this, but this book had human Muslim characters in it, one of whom (Alsana) is hilarious and another who is all too human, that I really felt for.  This is the first time I have ever been able to relate to a Muslim.  I feel like I really had my mind broadened, eyes opened, etc.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a really fun game. but sometimes hard or other times easy. get this game tou will like it!!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book and the sensitive side of King Richard displayed in this book. Thought that the ending was quite lovely and very powerful since it was tied to real life history. Made me appreciate that in the United States we have the freedom to choose and marry whom we love. Grateful NOT to be a Kingmaker's daughter, but I did relate to the character as in making sacrifices for family.
B00005TT77|4.0|This has some songs that could have used a bit of a different arrangement or perhaps the artist didn't match the song very well.. but overall, some really great renditions of GREAT Beatles tunes.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|Easy use for Toddler. My niece enjoys this app while on trips to kill the time, such as plane rides or long car rides (of course with assistance).
B000056HE9|5.0|Most who appreciate the timeless charm of earlier decades have caught up with the more well known holiday classics and are discovering hidden gems like this one.  The subject film seems to catch on more and more as the years go along.  The exceptional cast are a delight in their respective roles, down to the game taxi driver.  Contrary to one misguided biographer, Ms. Young turned in a flawless performance as the gentle, weary wife of an ambitious man.  One of the welcome features of this production is its soft and gentle tone. There are many memorable, old fashioned scenes worthy of an annual revisit.  It charms the heart as it weaves its timeless tale of transformation for some weary life travelers who have misplaced the joy of earlier times. The true meaning of Christmas is all over the unfolding of this lovely fantasy.  Yes, fantasy, but we do like those at Christmastime especially.  Cynics may disagree, but they usually do.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I think this album is exceptional. Alicia Keys contines to impress me and keep me as one of her biggest supports. This album shows her growth as a woman, as a mother, as a wife and her fearlessness inspires me to go after everything I want. BUY this albumn you won't regret it.
0440178002|5.0|This is an extremely enjoyable historical novel -- much more so than I expected. I've traveled frequently to Japan and learned a small bit of Japanese, and I enjoyed it a lot. There are some minor cultural details I could quibble with, but it has more insight into Japan than any other novel I've read, and considering that it was written 40 years ago, it is amazing. And a great story.<br /><br />I won't go into the plot since you should read it for yourself, and other reviews detail it if you're interested. Here's the minimum version: an Englishman becomes stranded in Japan during one of the most tumultuous and interesting periods of (real) Japanese history. Clavell does a great job of weaving the fictional narrative into the larger historical context. It's not as detailed historically as, say, McCullough's Rome series (e.g., [[ASIN:0061582417 The First Man in Rome]]). But it is informative as well as entertaining and provides interesting insight into what was happening in Japan and between Japan and the West.<br /><br />The main issue is this: it's over 1100 pages long (in paperback) so when are you going to read it?  I'd suggest taking it along on an international trip. I recently had a six hour flight where it kept me interested the whole way. And then you can read a bit more each day when you're jet-lagged in the morning or evening. The number of characters is manageable and changes slowly (unlike, say, War and Peace where you have to keep track of all of them) -- so once you start, it will be easy to continue.<br /><br />My only criticism is that it has quite a few episodes that are essentially quite similar (so-and-so has a surprise attack on so-and-so, and there is a lot of bloodshed but much honor). But the action is good and there is plenty of other intrigue, plot, drama, and history intertwined brilliantly to overlook that flaw. Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy Solitaire by MobilityWare.  Great way to unwind at night.  We play it often.  Enjoy the challenge. It shows how long to win and number of moves and keeps track of best score.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Witty, entertaining and brilliant! I think this is an extremely well done adaptation of the classic stories. The production values are supurb and the stories are riviting.
1451673442|5.0|If you have already read the Sacret and the Power, it is time to read this. You will like this and help you more.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very interesting historical novel with great character development.  Just re-read Fall of Giants before starting on book 2 of the Century Trilogy- I enjoyed it just as much this time.
B0087ZG7PW|4.0|It arrived and I would recommend this to any Hitchcock fan! We are very satisfied!This movie is a classic too!!
0316069434|5.0|Michael Connelly is a treasure. This latest addition to the Harry Bosch series is outstanding and ranks among his best. Bosch is chasing down a \\"cold case\\" from the '92 LA riots. In typical Bosch fashion, he has managed to piss everyone off in his singular pursuit of the truth. Well drawn characters, solid plot lines (including his relationship with Maddie, his 16 year old daughter) and page turning excitement. Buy it, read it, ENJOY!!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I like all her books.  The twists and turns are hilarious.  She does a good job of keeping my interest by being entertaining and funny.
0156027321|4.0|I became interested in reading this book when I saw previews for the movie. I found the book to be very well written but it did not capture me as seems to have others (based on the volume of positive reviews). I think this one of those novels that grabs you on a spiritual (meaning of the spirit not in the religious sense) level or it does not. I was hoping for more.
B004Z4LZ7E|5.0|it´s everything i could expect,,, there isn´t any kind of great surprise in there, like &#34;wooow&#34; but, the images wort it.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Amazingly different to her previous books. A quite long story about the different inhabitants of a small English village. There is much detail about the emotions of each person, particularly the adolescents and about the relationships they have with each other and their parents.
B00943SQCI|5.0|Johnny Depp is at the top of his form in this movie.  The plot is very good, acting excellent, the female leads gorgeous, and the cinematography very well done.  Watch it!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|A bit predictable -( I assume she is going to love him so much he changes his ways), but titivating. Didn't make me rush to get the other two in the series.
B0010T0OCY|4.0|The plot in this movie is complex enough that a viewer will not follow it unless he/she stays very involved.  Plan to actively watch the movie to get it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent Read, was bought to read over the holidays but I could not wait.<br /><br />Highly recommend to buy this year
B009VB7QQA|3.0|I was not as enamored with this movie as my wife and daughter.  They enjoyed it, but I never really got into it.  There are some superb reviews of the movie already on Amazon, but  I'd rather have waited until this was on free TV
B008MEM24S|4.0|better than wheres my water.  l<br />There are a lot of challenging puzzles.  athe animmation keeps it fun to play
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The plot in this movie is far too contrived, but given the actors, sets and effects, who cares?  It's a great movie for entertainment value, if a bit hard to get the 'Suspension of disbelief'.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I had been skeptical about this movie. The first two are really good and I was skeptical of number 3. I was surprised and pleased that they worked hard to do a good movie and not just milk it. Five Stars
B009KHCRVO|2.0|For some reason I expected more from this movie.  It's difficult to explain my dissatisfaction without giving away much of the plot.  I suggest waiting until it is on free TV.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|The 2nd best of all vacation movie. This one is nuts. Should be seen every Christmas. Uncle Eddy at his best.
B003SI05PG|3.0|My grandson loves this movie.  I get distracted and end up reading during the movie.  Buy it for the kid in you, or your kids.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Great book for ages 10-14 I really liked it very very very much I would reread it a a million times
B004V8W54Q|4.0|Early Jonathan Pryce is fun to watch, and this unusual movie is highly rated as one of the best scifi movies ever.  At a minimum it is a must watch movie.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is a really good game, but it keeps kicking me out and won't load. please fix this problem and it will be a five star game for me.
1433524627|5.0|After having this Bible for a year and toting it around regularly, it is still in great shape.  The binding started out a little stiff, but it has loosened up perfectly.  It has informative study notes for each verse.  The print size is a little small for those who do not have good vision, but otherwise, it is not an issue.<br /><br />For anyone wanting to dig deeper into Scripture, I recommend this Bible.  Plus it looks and feels great.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I was looking for this app for the last 20 years of my life.  When I found it, it filled the most basic necessity that had never been resolved: the ability to know what song your are listening to.  Perfect.  I am an engineer, and not exactly sure how they accomplish this.
B0083EW97W|4.0|Good CD so far. Have not had a ton of time to listen to it but what I have heard so far, I like!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille keeps me spellbound in this one.<br /><br />I have read every one of his books, never unsatisfied with any of them
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is an excellent television drama. I think it is very well written and the acting is exceptional. Great storyline; chilling suspense and plot twists abound.
0345529057|5.0|I actually purchased this as a gift for my sister because I love this series of books so much.  I highly recommend it!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I don't understand why Amazon Instant Video does not have a video app to play movies on Android Jelly Bean.

B000L212HW|4.0|Was an awesome movie,Matthew Mconehey at his best before all the chick flicks! Christian Bale was great as one of his first few movies!
0446547573|5.0|I Loved this book, I could not put it down onced I started reading it--which is usually what happens when I begin a Nicholas Sparks novel! But this one, hands down was the best. He was so detailed and specific, his writing of the characters and scenes were different somehow though I can't point my finger on it. I felt like I was 'Katie\\" I felt her emotions, all of them. I don't want to say too much, but I will say you will not regret picking up this book. Read it, it is a must read.
B008JEJVXG|5.0|All I can say is WOW here! I can't stop listening to this album. One of the best of the year for sure. It reminds me of some of the best stuff from the 80's, but in an updated way. Dreamy, goose-bump inducing tunes with poetic lyrics that actually seem relevant and relatable. \\"Through the Grass\\" is my favorite, but they're all awesome.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Thanks for this wonderful app.  It is something I can carry with me every where.  I love the portability that it allows me
0441172717|5.0|There has always been writings of science fiction, but the novel Dune, by Frank Herbert, sets a new standards. Dune does more than create a fantastic feudalistic universe, Herbert uses his characters to express key aspects of humans. The novel starts with a young boy, Paul, the son of a strong-willed Duke, who is about to move to a dangerous new planet. Along with this stress Paul has been visited by an old woman called a Reverend Mother who tests if he is a \\"real\\" human by seeing if he had control of his mind. After this quick but significant trial Paul is told that he is to become a great prophet (who can see the past through his ancestry and predict the future). The novel consists of his evolution from this boy pondering the aspects of human nature and what is means to be human to a leader with foresight in a world of chaos.<br /><br /> Herbert does a great job of emphasising human behavior through the characters that value power, greed, honor and just water. The men plotting against Paul's father want to claim the emperor's place by killing Paul's father. Paul's father is a leader of men. He inspires intense honor and loyalty with his commanders and servants. The indigenous population of Dune called the Fremen who live in the desert value water more than anything else because there so little on the planet. Herbert comments on extremists by emphasizing the pure focus the Fremen have on water and how the religious dream of their planet maintaining a water cycle is enough for the Fremen to give up their lives. He also brings in the philosophy of harsh conditions create the strongest people, by having the feared warriors of the emperor come from a once prosperous planet turned into a slave planet, for the purpose of breeding superior warriors.<br /><br /> Sometimes when reading this book the reader might feel that they are receiving a psychology lecture instead of an actual story. Especially in the beginning when Paul is receiving lessons from his mentors. \\"A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.\\" Also Paul, when he has the need to put aside his emotions to think clearly, has several insights into how to overcome emotion, \\"Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. ... Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\\" These mini quotes of wisdom can sometimes make the story seem to be prolonged by the time Herbert spends integrating them with his story.<br /><br /> Even though this book has a lot of philosophy it contains a mystical world much like the captivating epic Star Wars. Dune, however, came before Star Wars. Dune could be argued to be the novel that set the standard for current science fiction pieces. Dune uses its futuristic world to predict like Paul does, the future our own world could become. Dune is realistic, though, in that people act rationally and many aspects of the futuristic culture are explained with principles known today. Herbert uses rational thinking when he explains the purpose of his many imaginative mechanism, which he takes the time to explain rather than leaving the reader confused.<br /><br />Dune is appealing because even though it is futuristic, it is based off of basic systems of society. The Political structure is based off of a feudalistic kingdom with rulers and subjects but instead of having countries to rule and fight over, Herbert has planets. Herbert chooses to have the main struggle between these kingdoms to be over a simple spice (with the bonus of cognitive properties), instead of some futuristic object. In this way Dune has a deep connection to medieval and basic human nature.<br /><br />  The book though can be hard to follow because of its sudden rush into the world of reason and political warfare. Herbert relates these tensions by writing from the perspective of several characters, including the antagonist. Also the sudden jumps intime can be annoying because Herbert will suddenly skip ahead in the story because Paul has an insight on how things are going to turn out, and then that insight suddenly happens. This could leave the reader feeling gypped out of storyline.<br /><br /> Overall this is a novel that everyone with a taste for imaginative and ingenious writing should read and appreciate as a classic that is the heart of modern science fiction.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Personally I like the way the author constructs the stories where the hero is fighting and winning against the insiders with the big ego's as well as weeding out the threats from outside America.  I guess it appeals to the quiet underdog in me.................I like it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVED season 1 & 2 :-)  Really look forward to season 3 :-) It is really amazing how this series keeps you wanting to keep watching it!
B005LAII8A|5.0|A mediocre execution of the movie's premise still would have resulted in a pretty cool movie.  A man hunt against the future version of the main character's self?  Awesome.  But the strength of the movie is not that it's about a guy trying to outsmart himself, the two characters are actually very different, though definitely and recognizably the same man.  Basically, both the young and old version are clearly Joe, but you can see the development and changes that have taken place in old Joe, and they make sense.  So it's more than a man hunt against themselves, it's about them trying to figure each other out.<br /><br />  The movie also had a lot more \\"slow\\" parts than I expected, and that's what really made the movie.  There was a lot of depth that I didn't expect, and it actually left me asking myself ethical questions.<br /><br />  Pierce Gagnon is the best 5 year old actor you will ever see.  Most kids can pull off the cute, funny kid, but he pulled off an actual important character.  He displayed so much as a child actor.  Unreal.  His performance alone makes the movie worth watching.<br /><br />  If you were hoping for an action packed, sci-fi thriller, you may be a bit disappointed.  But if you expect a well done, extremely well acted movie with its fair share of action and sci-fi elements, this is for you.
B00511PTWM|5.0|lovin it this item was just what i needed . see that i  only have one outlet in my car.. i needed the the swivel and longgated adapterbecause the lighter is resessed under my dash..  very pleased
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best season so far! I dont have cable anymore but I had to spend money on this. Totally worth it!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This film is very well made, well paced, just very well thought out, and very well crafted toward what it wants to be.<br />It reminds me a lot of those big tentpole movies of the thirties and fourties. Hundreds of Extras, big overarching storyline, hero on a journey for self-redemption, it's just very classic in that regard.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend giving this one a rental, you will not be disappointed in my opinion.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is the album that started it all! It pretty much changed the way we listen to Hard Rock/Heavy Metal today. Recorded in 1977 and released in 1978, this album still sounds as fresh as the day it came out. Ask any Van Halen fan on what their favorite album is by them, and I guarantee that most of them will say Van Halen 1. Definitely one of the greatest rock albums of all time! A must-buy from any hard rocker! \m/
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I swear the only song I've ever heard from Ellie Goulding was 'lights' and loved it, still I was a little hesitant to buy an entire album without ever have listened to her other songs. I regret NOTHING, this album is amazing, I love every one of her songs here. Her voice can do amazing things, definitely a recommend to EVERYONE, i say try it, listen to her through youtube and you'll see how amazing this album is.

B005AERS74|4.0|I am a huge fan of Maroon 5, while I wasn't in love with all their songs on this album I didn't hate any of them. And some of them you just have to listen to a couple times and you end up hooked anyways. If you usually enjoy their music this is a must have
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I am happy to have it on BluRay so I can watch it in full 1080p.
B00973DDN2|4.0|I never was an actual fan of the killers, I enjoyed some of their music but didn't really listen to them. When I saw the album so cheap I previewed each and every song to see if it was worth it, and I must say it has been. Although not my typical kind of music to listen the songs have definitely been repeated on my ipod probably one too many times. I'd say give it a chance, it might surprise you the way it did me
B000WS4PCO|5.0|Hello!!!<br />&#34;This is the music of my youth&#34;<br />With this band I was practically a kid and grew.<br />Be the most beautiful feelings in me, and bring me back to the carefree past.<br />In addition to being a cult band and every song is a hit,<br />Needless to say or describe anything more about 'U2' band.<br />Best Regards<br />Nikola.M

B0081JPTCQ|5.0|this is a really nice app, its got a lot of different types of notebook/planner pages to choose from, and the expressions are really cute too. i find this app very handy :)
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Too repetitive and didn't care if I finished it or not. It reall wasn't a story and jumped around the globe to to many people for interviews. Only  a few parts had any real tension.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This by far had to be one of the most action packed episodes I had seen from the show.  The ending leaves you wanting more as it is a bit of a cliffhanger, but all in all one of the best Walking Dead episodes to date.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Love their music.  I have many of their CD's and waiting for the future releases. They have a nice diversity in songs.
B002IYEQR4|4.0|Great edition. It doesn't include the spanish audio track, but it's great anyway. I Love the movie and also te extras.
B009EP3DJM|4.0|When Ke$ha was still somewhat new on the scene, I received a lot of flack for supporting an artist whom so many were quick to write off as just another drunken party girl desperate for her 15 minutes. Now, I admit I love my share of mindless pop music anyway, but what made her stand out for me was her incredible knack for writing strong, catchy hooks and incorporating clever, intricate wordplay. And however silly the finished product might be, you never got the feeling that she wasn't in on the joke, unlike so many other popular artists who shall remain nameless. I don't throw around the word genius very often, but as pop music goes, she really is. Needless to say, I was very much looking forward to her new album, Warrior.<br /><br />Truth be told it's kind of a difficult album to rate, because while she has no doubt matured as a person and as a musical artist (see next paragraph), on the surface a large portion of it just isn't as catchy as I would have expected, and as I said above that's one of the things I can usually count on in a Ke$ha record. When the single Die Young was released to radio, it never really elevated beyond \\"just okay\\" to me, and still hasn't. The message is good, of course, but it ultimately felt like a half-hearted reworking of We R Who R from her last CD. Unfortunately, I'd say a good half the album is comprised of tracks that left me feeling the same way - not bad necessarily, but nothing you'd likely be caught singing along to, and only just distinctive enough to vaguely remind you of something else she'd done before. Not that there aren't some classic Ke$ha gems to be found here; Thinking of You is a really good \\"up yours\\" kind of song that would make your grandmother's hair stand on end, and All That Matters is a welcome throwback to 90's dance in the vein of Real McCoy or Ace of Base. Her duet with Iggy Pop, called Dirty Love, puts her in full rocker mode and is actually quite impressive considering it doesn't even break three minutes. Still, even the tracks I do enjoy in the moment have yet to really solidify themselves in my brain the way Tik-Tok or Take it Off did upon first listen a couple years ago.<br /><br />However, if you dig a little deeper and look beyond the obvious lack of Top 40 potential, you might be surprised to find that where the record really shines is in its ballads. \\"Introspective\\" isn't a word that comes up a lot in relation to Ke$ha, but songs like Wonderland paint a poignant picture of a successful young woman remembering her roots, while Love Into the Light is a forward-looking electro ballad bordering on ethereal. Absolutely phenomenal. Past Lives deserves honorable mention here as well, though my favorite song on the album has to be Last Goodbye; the acoustic structure is not only an unexpected direction for her to take, but really accentuates her vocal range and abilities. Play this one for any of her detractors and you'll have them eating their words, guaranteed.<br /><br />So, like I said, taken as a whole Warrior is pretty tricky to form a definitive opinion about. Many of the elements I loved about her earlier releases are downplayed this time around, but at the same time she took so many new risks that paid off and you just can't help but appreciate her as an evolving artist. She wears a lot of hats and dabbles in a lot of styles this time around, but a common theme of self-acceptance and enjoying life runs throughout without ever pandering to or victimizing her audience a la Lady Gaga. (Before anyone goes off, I adore Gaga and her efforts at equality awareness. But it often seems she's bent solely on gaining sympathy for her problems rather than solving them. Just an observation.) In fact, in a weird way, even though I don't love as many individual tracks as I do on her past CDs, Warrior still somehow comes off as the better overall album. I still don't think it's the most mainstream or hook-heavy brand of pop music you'll hear - you really need to LISTEN to it rather than let it play mindlessly in the background at some party - but the way she manages to be fun, silly, bold, gross, witty, thoughtful, meloncholy, sarcastic, and inspirational all at the same time is indeed a feat to behold.ather than let it play mindlessly in the background at some party - but the way she manages to be fun, silly, bold, gross, witty, thoughtful, meloncholy, sarcastic, and inspirational all at the same time is indeed a feat to behold.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Talk about life imitating art. I've been involved lately in doing a private art project inspired by jazz musicians. And this album was something that ended up in the CD player as I was doing this. Having known Lee Ritenour for many years primarily as a member of George Duke's band and his famous session work,it was only recently I began exploring some of his solo recordings from his GRP years. Lee's guitar playing possesses what I'd call a quit fire. He's not exactly a flamboyant and loud player. At the same time there's a good reason for that. He seems to keep his playing style rather subdued in volume to draw the focus into his main asset as a musician: his instrumental fluidity,legendary level of technique and of course his ability to interpret and reinterpret melodies. Over the years,of course he's played with many different musicians from all over the spectrum of jazz.  Needless to say,his musical and likely personal closeness with all of them results in a situation where he could (and would) easily call upon them for a session. Well I am sure not all of them are here on this. But a good many are.<br /><br />  The opener \\"The Village\\" features ex boss George Duke and Stanley Clarke,along with David Weckl for a recording that centers right into the rhythm section for some hard and exploratory jazz funk. A version of Herbie Hancock's \\"Fat Albert Rotunda\\" with Patrice Rushen and Marcus Miller,as well as the trio oriented \\"July\\" all zero in on the steady,tight groove. On \\"River Man\\" he brings in Dave Grusin and Will Kennedy for a haunting rendition of \\"River Man\\",a very jazz standard type take on the Nick Cave song sung by non other than Kurt Elling in his equally haunted manner. Most of the rest of the albums songs such as \\"800 Street By Feet\\",his own \\"LA By Bike\\" and \\"Rose Petals\\" concentrate on strong,rhythmic jazz-rock fusion type numbers with a good deal of emphasis on improvisational jazz playing. On his take of Chick Corea's \\"Children's Song\\" and \\"Spam-Boo-Limbo\\" even the instrumentation itself seems to bounce and dance as the Latin side of Lee,one of the key elemtns in his sound from the outset,really takes presidents. \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\" is the closest song on this album to a rock song featuring the vocalist Zamajobe.<br /><br />  \\"Dolphin's Don't Dance\\" is one of the most powerful numbers on the album,sound very much like the type of song early Weather Report would do representing the earliest days of the fusion genre. Of course with Alan Pasqua and Peter Erksine on board one could say it essentially IS a Weather Report number of sorts-minus,of course the incomperable late Joe Zawinul. The album ends with Punta Del Soul,again featuring the winners of Lee's 6 String Theory competition for this year on a vibrant Latin funk/fusion number. Rhythm is the key phrase in everything on this album. The guitar,keyboards,bass lines,even the melodies themselves consistently place all their emphasis on the rhythm of the songs. Of course these are the rhythm section. At the same time,all of these qualities come together to make this one of Lee Ritenour's most consistently funk oriented recordings in quite a long time. All musicians,from well known's to unknowns,come through on top of their game instrumentally and every one of these songs,though coming from often very different ends of the jazz,fusion and funk spectrum will likely be extremely strong and involving for the person listening to it.imbo\\" even the instrumentation itself seems to bounce and dance as the Latin side of Lee,one of the key elemtns in his sound from the outset,really takes presidents. \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\" is the closest song on this album to a rock song featuring the vocalist Zamajobe.<br /><br />  \\"Dolphin's Don't Dance\\" is one of the most powerful numbers on the album,sound very much like the type of song early Weather Report would do representing the earliest days of the fusion genre.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great alarm app with many different options and it works well with my kindle fire... now I wake up with a great playlist of songs that begin quietly so I can wake up gently. I need that in the morning!
B005ETA5K2|2.0|The unit does not pick up signals nearly as well as the Wi Fi units that I already use on two other systems.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Outstanding book.  Could not put it down.  Mitch Rapp is a great character and I really enjoy the nonstop action.
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|It was neat reading band learning about the beasts. I really enjoyed the written in notes. They were pretty cute hands funny.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|After two months, the adapter became very unstable. I had to constantly wiggle it around so that the connection between the HDTV and my mac would stay intact. After a while, the adapter just stopped working altogether. Not worth the money. Just buy a generic brand.
B000FC0V3E|2.0|Not one of his best. I found the book very limited and not very interesting. The main character is constantly rejected by a rather flighty woman he is in love with although he is prepared to rescue her from various unsuitable liaisons.
B005T87QCI|4.0|fun game but gets boring after a while and no zues or atom and there's different bots than in the movie
B0083GR6Y6|2.0|The Grey was unrealistic, underwhelming.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone...and I am usually a fan of Liam Neeson movies.  This was a miss.
B00AE2J93I|5.0|This movie is very smart and funny, great writing that gives life to a story that has been told many times. Great for anyone really, old and young will love this one.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|Supertramp Live in Paris is by far the best material that I have seen of this great Band. Acknoledging<br />that this concert is from the 70's, the quality of the film and the audio were above my expectations. Recommend<br />this DVD for all music fans of one of the best music periods known up to now.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A very suspenseful book that makes you want to keep reading on, and a very happy ending that leaves you smiling
1579128955|5.0|Absolutely brilliant and very informative. You might also like [[ASIN:B008CPTBY6 Atoms, Space, Time and Other Cool Stuff]] which deals with the Periodic Table and Atomic Structure in a non-threatening easy to understand way.
1451695195|5.0|I bought this book for my husband. He needs solid proof to believe in anything.<br />He could not put it down. With highly educated people or over educated people, they over think issues.<br />This was a logical path to the after life and God for him.
B000ID1J40|5.0|This movie has an allstar cast, even in the minor roles. The plotting is intricate, charactoers are quirky. It has all the elements of a great movie.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Amazon makes it really difficult to learn to use this Kindle by not including a user's manual.  There are differences between this and the first edition and a print reference would be helpful.  A simple problem like, How do you raiise the keyboard when using Netflix? has occurred for me and it would be great to have a reference to go to.  Books on the Kindle don't seem to help since I have to move from screen to screen to get the answers I am looking for.  This has been my problem with both editions.<br />The Fire HD is light, slim and has great video and sound, its access to mega libraries is outstannding.  I like it but not its user manual (Isn't one).
B008N5UX9M|4.0|It's not a metal album folks, so get over it.  It has obvious influences from UFO, The Who, Thin Lizzy, and it is a good one.  Give it a listen.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I like to listen to some of the \\"new\\" music out there.  I do not fit the intended demographics, but I like most of the songs on this CD.
0385535147|5.0|I would recommend this new book by John Grisham.  If you love lawyer stories, this is up to Grisham's usual style and skill.  A wonderful read!!
B00006RAKP|5.0|I wanted a collection of Elton John's hits and this CD seems to contain them all.  At least my favorite EJ songs for my \\"old days\\" collection.  All in their original release style.  Recommended if you need a collection of his greatest songs, without buying them individually.
B001I45UFC|5.0|We are reading this to our children! They are really enjoying it. Our son 4 years old asks most nights to read it some more!!
B00006IM9Q|5.0|I am not a big Blondie fan, but remember all the group's hit songs.  Wanted a CD with their greatest hits for my \\"old days\\" collection, and this CD fits that bill.
B009LY72LQ|4.0|These dolls and the creative ideas that spawned them are great! The big problem trying to buy one on Amazon, or any other place, is that you don't know what version you will be getting and there is no way to verify this. Amazon has these \\"2 doll\\" and parts sets listed, with photos that show them coming with 2 complete doll body torsos and enough parts to make 2 complete dolls (except only 1 wig), BUT they ALSO have the identical doll sets listed, and at the SAME PRICE, but the photos SHOW ONLY ONE BODY TORSO coming in the set! This is VERY CONFUSING, because all the Amazon descriptions say they comes with \\"2 BODY TORSOS\\". I called Amazon for clarification and even AMAZON DIDN'T KNOW which was correct!<br /><br />  When Mattel first came out with these dolls, they DID come with the 2 body torsos, BUT Mattel got cheap and decided to take away one body, so that you would have to give them more money in order to have 2 complete dolls (and the set has only come with one wig from day one! How cheap can you be, Mattel?). The problem here is Mattel. These same items, with 2 torsos or with 1, have the same identification numbers, so there is no way, other than looking at the actual item when it comes to you, to be sure which set you are getting. I have a good friend who works for Mattel and she told me about this. Since I needed at least one set with 2 dolls for a Christmas gift, I had no choice other than to order 2 different, 2 doll sets, and hope that one of the sets is from the older stock, that came with 2 body torsos. I will have to return the one with only one body, (2 kids and 3 dolls don't work out), that is \\"IF\\" either one of them comes with only 1. At this stage of the game, both could come with 2 torsos, or both with one or one of each. Who knows? Makes it hard to do your shopping when you don't know exactly how many you will be getting, until their arrival! This is just a WARNING to be cautious when buying these dolls from anyone!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the alternating chapters and was kept entertained until the end of this book.  Good evil charactor development and well worth reading.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My grandson plays more than I do but he can't seem to put it down. He just loves the cool stuff you can do
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book needs to be read in one sitting or you will be completely confused about who is who and have to start again.
B008LG6SXS|5.0|Easy navigation, great content like photos and maps, and the best prices for booking anywhere in the world! Highly recommend.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT YOU NEVER HEARD OF AND TAKE A CHANCE ON BASED ON THE AMAZON DESCRIPTION AND REVIEWS.  THE STORY SOUNDED INTERESTING, A MIX OF SF,HORROR AND HISTORICAL DRAMA.  A SPACESHIP CRASHES ON EARTH OF 700AD NEAR A VIKING TOWN.<br />THE ONLY SURVIVOR OF THE SHIP IS CAUGHT BY THE VIKINGS WHO THINK HE IS GUILTY OF A<br />MASSACRE OF A NEIGHBORING VILLAGE.  THEY FIND OUT IT'S NOT HIM BUT A CREATURE THAT ARRIVED WITH HIM.  THEN THINGS GET INTERESTING!<br /><br />THE FILM IS WELL ACTED BY A GOOD CAST INCLUDING JIM CAVIEZEL,JOHN HURT AND SOFIA MYLES. THE PICTURE IS BEAUTIFULLY FILMED AND THERE IS A REALLY INTERESTING MONSTER.  THE STORY HANGS TOGETHER WELL AND THE FILM FROM BEGINNING TO END IS VASTLY ENTERTAINING.<br /><br />I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE SEVERAL TIMES NOW ON CABLE.  EVERYONE I KNOW WHO SEES IT IS IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS MOVIE. IT LOOKS LIKE A MAJOR PRODUCTION. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT DIDN'T BECOME MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE THEATERS.  ITS A DVD HIT.<br /><br />YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE. BUY IT.

B000002AGN|5.0|The great artist that was may have left us but his genius remains forever. Irreplaceable! We will never see his like again
B001KZG99A|5.0|I saw the movie just recently, and I have to say, it is the best one I have seen yet. Good effects, storyline, everything is perfect and there are funny moments ever so often.

0547884591|5.0|I'm a long-time fan of Tim Ferriss, ever since I read The 4 Hour Work week. The 4 Hour Chef is a continuation of Ferriss' life's work- lifestyle design generally, and how to hack every task/goal to accomplish it faster and better, specifically.<br /><br />Ferriss is not for everyone- dude is OBSESSED and FOCUSED- and I find that many of his teachings require the same in the student. Also, just because he teaches you how to acquire skills FAST doesn't mean he teaches you to acquire them EASY.<br /><br />But, if you are willing to be OBSESSED and FOCUSED, and work HARD for what you want, Ferriss will show you the path. And this is really a special thing.<br /><br />Finally, I have both the kindle and hardcover versions of this book. The hardcover book is beautiful- whoever did the creative on it is a masterworker.

B0091TGWYE|4.0|The one I purchased was faulty. I placed a negative review here and to my surprise was contacted by the Snugg company via email. They apologized for the problem and replaced the defective iPhone 5 case with a new one at no additional charge. It is rare when a company goes to such lengths to assure customer satisfaction. The replacement securely fits my iPhone 5 perfectly and the elastic pull strap works very smoothly. Highly-recommended.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved the way this book is written. It was a joy to read. Her take on the different creature races was interesting. Of course the ending was disappointing as it leaves you hanging and makes it where you will want to get the next book.
1435106342|2.0|I got an old edition, not the Newest one shown in the picture. It was sticky and dirty. Had to sell it to a friend who didn't mind that.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Anyone who is into law and politics should enjoy the details of this book. Relates pretty much to the present!  Even those interested in the family life of the Lincolns should love this book. Great detail. Great research! Who knew that Lincoln was such a  entertainer with his down-to-earth funny stories or that his boys were such &#34;hellions&#34; in the White House?  Also, the movie, &#34;Lincoln&#34;, is a must-see and relates to this book very well!

I feel once a game is completed another should come available immediately...<br /> It keeps the player playing!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen is a legend, so it should come as no surprise that this latest work is sheer genius, but it goes an important step further. While he's taken us with him through so much of his life over the years, this time he's sharing some incredibly thoughtful verses about what it means to see the future through the eyes of an older man. Love, remorse, humor, playful teasing, death, celebration, politics...all look quite different at this stage, and the deep and often provocative meanings that Cohen is known for become even more sublime. Don't pass up seeing this man in concert (he sounds even better in person) and certainly don't miss the brilliance of this CD. Welcome Back Mr. Cohen. We've been waiting for you and celebrate your return. The sophistication of your writing remains treasured. Well done.
B00111YM5G|5.0|I was surprised how good this was. Makes you think about things and has a bit of a shocker at the end. VERY well done.
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|So many reasons to watch this movie...<br />Random thoughts:<br />Damaged people making their way through life as best they can...the rage oozing from Tom Hardy's pores...he barely speaks, but is totally amazing...the loyalty of Joel Edgerton...the Rocky-like story line......and damn, Nick Nolte can still act.<br />Women will be drawn to the character dynamics.  Don't be put off by the MMA.<br />Men will LOVE the MMA action.<br />well-worth your time.

Keep in mind it is the free app of the day, but if I had come across this app prior to that I would not be satisfied with having made said purchase. But that is one of the many issues I had with this app game. I am not going to pretend that I know the ins and outs of software and permissions, and every potential hazzard that it entails. But I know for a fact that many apps and games have never been installed on my Android phone or Kindle Fire because of the crazy permissions that have no relation to any aspect of said game or app.<br /><br />For example, the permissons for [[ASIN:B0096CDG0O Dice With Buddies]] are as follows:<br /><br />Read only access to phone state.<br />Get notified that the operating system has finished booting.<br />Send SMS messages.<br />Open network sockets.<br />Write to external storage.<br />Access information about Wi-Fi networks.<br />Access coarse (e.g., Cell-ID, WiFi) location.<br />Read the user's contacts data.<br />Access information about networks.<br /><br />I know app developers need to make money, but having intrusive requirements are a drawback to potential business. Yes word of mouth is quite strong, but so is that of the customer. Why is it necessary to read my contacts and send SMS messages to them? For a dice game at that? Besides the crazy gall of it all, are you going to pay for the texts as well? That is a resounding no for a game people have already paid for. Again, you do not need to be a professional when it comes to realizing what from what is sketchy, and if you are a fan of games similar to Yahtzee this would probably be a game directly up your alley; however, all of this ridiculous permissons for such a simplified game is exorbitant regardless for the free charge of the day.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|The story is twisted and complicated and hopeful and redemptive.  The acting is terrific.  I've been going through a Mads Mikkelsen moment....he commands the screen no matter what movie he's in.  Soooooo worth your time.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This is a wonderful historical period series.  I love the way the characters develop and the rich and lush setting is beautifully filmed. It's addicting.
B007Q476KU|5.0|Bawled my eyes out.  Wonderful story about the bond between a boy - man and his horse.  Beautiful cinematography.  The whole package.  AWESOME.
0525953728|5.0|Judging from all the different accounts regarding the UBL mission, this appears to be the most first-hand, most detailed, and least politically charged.  God bless the men who do this type of work.  I read it in one 8 hour sitting and could not put it down.  I dind't have any finger nails left after finishing the book.  Make it a movie NOW!
B00914JWSW|5.0|I am like many on here a follower of good singers and Barbra is no exception, I saw her on her London tour in 1994 and again in the noughties and wondered if it would be much cop. The latter concert was a little disappointing after her concert of the the 90s in London, but this, THIS cd of her back catalogue I'd reminiscent of the Just for the Record Cd of all her ages, coalescing all her genres and timescales.<br />I can't fault this, every track is a selected winner,and highlights the fact there are few singers of our last twenty years or more who will have the longevity of this soulful singer
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Stunning color and detail. If you love nature, have kids, and have a blueray player, THIS IS THE BOX SET TO PURCHASE.  I can't believe that the DVD set would even come close to the spectacular display experienced on an HD television.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|Wow.  I thoroughly disliked this movie.  I suppose it was even more disappointing after The Dark Knight.  In my opinion, this was a long, tediously boring film that had Batman in it very little overall. The only interesting character who had any significant development and decent screen time was Catwoman.  I recommend that anyone interested in this movie rent it before buying.  I wish I had.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|It's not a moving, patriotic military themed film.  But it is an action-packed, military-themed sci-fi thriller.  As long as you aren't a Surface Warfare Officer in the United States Navy, you will probably enjoy the action pace and climactic sequences.  If you are a SWO, then probably rent it rather than own it.  You will be frustrated with the technical innaccuracies potrayed in the way that a surface ship and the Navy as a whole operates.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I knew all the songs and I enjoyed it ; especially the song with Don Johnson. Sinatra was great also!!!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Get the tissues - If you have a heart, this ones a tear jerker - One of my all time favorite Black & White Films<br />As a Public Health Nurse in Eastern North Carolina in the 1970's,  this was the way of life in many Migrant Camps. Sad, sad situations and living conditions...<br />Wonder if it occurs today ???
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Amazing & Brilliant - Plus will touch your heart - Who among us  are the true ones who are &#34;less than&#34; ?<br />The question of who is smart & who &#34;is not&#34;  - What is intelligence ?<br />What constitutes  a true &#34;heart&#34; ?<br />One of my all time favorites since I was a small child & at 60 years old it is still an all time favorite with me, my friends & my family !!
B003UESJFG|5.0|Love this movie.  Great fun, and good acting... even from Will Ferrel and Brad Pitt.  My little girls love it even more than I do.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|An enjoyable read, though lighter and less profound than I thought.  Very neat concepts and story lines though, especially as I enjoy any reading material involving time &#34;travel&#34;.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I lovd the first two books.  They really kept your interest.  Besides the sexual content, it is really a love story about how two people so different could make it work.  I thought E L James dropped the ball on the third book.  The story just faded.
B001226I7Y|5.0|If you even mildly like Neil Young, Live Rust is the quintessential album for you. Unlike many others, Neil Young and Crazy Horse often sound better live then they do in studio. Every song on this album is a Neil Young classic, so you can't go wrong.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This movie was better than broadway !!!<br />I loved it and teh characters were terrific, love it<br />package arrived on time and will purchase again
B009Z8HPYM|4.0|Unlike many of the geriatrics who are still making the rounds on the tour curcuit, Neil Young isn't mailing it in. Seriously, if you have always been a Neil Young fan there are several tunes on this album which you will listen to over and over. I also saw him in concert in support of Pill, and he is...the man.
B005LAII94|5.0|What an exciting movie,Salma was amazing . Just terrific, not what I expected<br />Arrived on time and will do business again
B008AK8FHM|5.0|With a lot of interest I read this book by Dr.Alexander.Of course this is a question everybody asks itself,only there is no  proof that this is what really happened, altough there are certain things that do not line up if this experience was other then the one presented.I would really love to believe that the experience of Dr.Alexander is true.It makes dying so much more easy to accept.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Arrived quickly, product in mint shape!  Giving as a gift and the person will love it, especially the specialty addition!
B001KQZ7I8|4.0|Very thought provoking book.  Helps to<br /> give meaning to why people act the way they do and for you to understand and give meaning to, your life.
B002APU580|5.0|Awesome. A very very cool story . The movie is extremely well done. The message is very wholesome and kid friendly. No violence, no foul language, no sensuality. Timeless story. All the acting is world class. Pretty true to the book. And agian, a very hopeful and edifying movie about contirition, bearing with one another, devotion, and family values. I would watch it  a million times and would even watch it without my wife.
1442300051|4.0|Michael Lewis takes a look at the wall street game of  sub-prime loan bond securities though the story of people who saw the train wreck  about to happen. The big wall street banks were making such huge profits from the securities  derived from sub-prime loans, they  ignored the risks involved.  The main characters in the book are not the big time bankers and bond traders that put these deals together but,  a few outsiders that could see that the house of cards would surely collapse when home prices began to fall and bet against them. There are no heroes in this book. Bond traders and the financial firms that profited  from their dealings come off as no better than a pack of pirates and liars.
B00130UFY2|5.0|Awesome. Every bourne movie is incredible but this is one of my favorites. Lots of action. Minimal sensuality, not a ton of bad language, but some pretty intense violence. But overall a great portrayal of someone fighting for their life in a situation in which it is necessary. Promotes bravery, courage, tenacity and shows the deplorability of duplicitousness, and deception.
076531178X|5.0|I first heard the name of Brandon Sanderson when he was chosen to finish a series called Wheel of Time. Am i glad that Harriet picked him, After reading his 1st Wheel of Time book i ran out and bought the Mistborn trilogy. It is an amazing book that you will enjoy reading. A great magic system, great plot and unique but believable characters. Highly recommended! Can not go wrong with this Series.
1607066017|5.0|I know following up on Y: The Last Man would be hard, but Vaughan has captured my interest quickly with this first volume of SAGA. The mix of fantasy and scifi perfectly blended, and the romance at the heart of it utterly believable even if they characters have wings and horns. Can't wait to read more.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I was excited to see Firefly given the overwhelmingly positive reviews about the show. 14 episodes later, I can say I enjoyed the show, but don't quite buy into the hype.<br /><br />Firefly is unabashedly a Western in space, which is both a weakness and a strength. On the positive side, this gives Serenity a hard edge with a nuanced sense of morality. The characters live in a moral grey zone and the show never forces use to draw sharp black or white lines around the crew. Each individual makes his or her own decisions and none are perfect. Some of their actions might shock modern viewers, but the show also does remind viewers that life in the fringes is hard. This is a recipe for rich character development.<br /><br />However, Firefly carries the Western motif a bit too far. It's not just a mix between Western and sci-fi genres, but actually a Western that takes place in space. The show reeks of being a Western, from the 19th century-style firearms, clothes, frequent shootouts, and even banjo theme music. If not for the spaceship, viewers could be forgiven for forgetting that the show takes place in 2517, not 1817. At times the heavy-handedness undermined the show's attempts at world-building, making the entire show less believable and less engrossing.<br /><br />Overall, Firefly is definitely worth a try for sci-fi fans - IF the idea of a Space Western sounds appealing. However, it certainly doesn't reach the greatness of Star Trek or even Battlestar Galactica for world-building and interesting plots.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|You know that moment when the reporter tells Virginia that there is a Santa Claus, because it's the belief in goodness and love and togetherness that matters, not what the other kids in the playground are saying? That's where this movie lives- in that time when you know that nothing bad will ever happen to you because of the guardians out there, be they religious, mythical or familial, between you and the monsters.<br /><br />Jack's adventure is nothing particularly new, and I found Chris Pine's voiceover a little jarring at first because he has such a deep voice for such a young creature, but that changes through the story as they add a little darkness to him. Also, this movie is NOT scary, and if your kid is scared by it you should probably expose him or her to more than they're being exposed to now. Just as Pine's voice grew on me, I came to love the multiculturalism represented by the other voices.  The fact that the guardians are not all American makes the story a little more universal.<br /><br />My favorite touch? Definitely the elves.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I watched the TV series [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly]]. I admit I liked it, but didn't become a hardcore fan. I was looking forward to [[ASIN:B000I9TY4G Serenity]], the movie I thought would wrap up many of the TV show's loose ends. Unfortunately, the movie seems to have suffered in the hands of \\"Hollywood\\".<br /><br />Where the TV show [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly]] focused on low-key character development, [[ASIN:B000I9TY4G Serenity]] is nearly indistinguishable from most big-budget sci-fi/action flicks. The film focuses on one of the more villains from the show: the Reavers, a group of space zombies. At least in the TV show, when we didn't ever actually see the Reavers, our imagination could fill in the blanks and thus magnify the horror. On screen, they're just B-movie zombies. A good portion of the movie features fight scenes between the crew and Reavers that go on way too long. Not what I expected from such a character-driven sci-fi franchise.<br /><br />I remember watching the TV show thinking that there are so many possibilities for River and the only way they could mess up the mystery surrounding her character would be to reveal that she was part of a secret weapons program. And, sadly, in Serenity the Alliance experiments on River are revealed to be a part of a secret weapons program. So, River was trained to be a super-soldier. As if that isn't the oldest sci-fi cliche in the book! Utterly disappointing. River was such an interesting character that I'd really hoped for something more exciting from her character.<br /><br />Finally, there were several pointless deaths of some of the principal characters. I won't spoil it by revealing who dies, but none of their deaths were particularly memorable or did much to drive the story along. Several other characters fall by the wayside, including the Companion Inara Serra, who rejoins Serenity briefly but doesn't do much after that. The ensemble that worked so well on TV often became the Nathan Fillion show on the big screen.<br /><br />Overall, I just got the sense that Universal thought Serenity would do better by appealing to teenage boys and throwing in a lot of battle scenes. It's a shame because there's a lot that I like about the movie. The production values, special effects, and acting are all much better than anything seen in the TV show. There's a gem of an interesting philosophical idea when the Firefly crew uncovers the mystery, but it's thrown out there in a heavy-handed way for a few moments before going back to more fight scenes. Given that there probably won't ever be another Firefly movie, this is a somewhat lackluster end for the franchise.<br /><br />Overall, 2.5 stars<br /><br />UPDATE (2/21/13): I rewatched the movie again and think I was a bit too harsh. While I don't think the movie lives up to the glory of the original show, nor is it a bomb. In fact, it does explore several subtle philosophical themes about government control over society and the many aspects of faith. I could have done with fewer Reavers and more characters, but I also appreciate that the Reavers play a more central role to the story than \\"just\\" mindless ghouls.<br /><br />Overall: 3.5, rounded down to 3 stars.reen.<br /><br />Overall, I just got the sense that Universal thought Serenity would do better by appealing to teenage boys and throwing in a lot of battle scenes.

1451695195|1.0|I ordered this book because I read an article about it. I wanted to read about a doctor's experience when he supposedly went to Heaven and back. As many of us wish, I was hoping his experience would prove that there is more to our existence than our feeble bodies and minds. Unfortunately, the author proved nothing, although he repeatedly stated that few people would understand his adventure. The events he reported about his near death experience are little more than what most people who have had NDEs report, although he claimed to be unique and to have gone much farther into Heaven. The actual story of his &#34;trip&#34; takes up only a few pages of the book. The majority of the rest of the book contains his theories and inappropriate analogies about why we should take his brief story seriously. I do believe there is something more to us, rather than the chemical soup that many scientists say we are. Most feel that consciousness is merely a chemical reaction, and a NDE is the same. After reading some of the many positive reviews about this book, I thought it would reveal more than every other story I've read. It didn't. Alexander seems to think that because his neocortex was not responding and the only spark of life was registered in his brain stem that that meant he was indeed out of his body and off in Heaven. I recall reading a well documented story about a boy whose entire brain was not responding. Not only was his neocortex offline, but there was no electrical activity whatsoever throughout his brain, including the brain stem. He was considered a vegetable, and after a few months his parents decided to pull the plug on the equipment that kept him alive. They did, and he woke up. No brain damage. And he had heard everything spoken in the room. So Alexander's experience was not so special. Perhaps sometimes, it seems, the brain takes a rest or plays tricks on us. I don't know how else to explain the boy's recovery. But as far as Alexander is concerned, his medical issues confound us, but his story, and I emphasize &#34;story,&#34; does not prove the existence of Heaven, angels, or God. What a shame. I wanted to believe.l issues confound us, but his story, and I emphasize &#34;story,&#34; does not prove the existence of Heaven, angels, or God. What a shame. I wanted to believe.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|One of the best shows I've watched in years. When a friend recommended this, I wasn't sure I'd like it. Now that I've seen several episodes, I love it!
B0047E9TRA|5.0|The beginning of it all. What girl who's felt left out and picked on hasn't wished for payback like this, but watch what you wish for, Karma bites back! Sissy Spacek, John Travolta etc.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love Rio. I love all Angry Birds! Please keep adding upgrades to each series....keeps it interesting and I can play for hours!

B005LAJ212|5.0|got hooked with this series from the 1st show.  Can't wait till season 2 makes it to DVD for sale!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The hunger games trilogy definitely lives up to its hype. The best series I've ever read; even rivaling the Harry potter and twilight series.
B0043C29GE|5.0|Great CD!  Can listen to this over and over, and not get tired of it! Will look into more Michael Buble music.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|love comic books and comic book movies...great cast of characters.....just plain fun to watch....dont expect intellectual value...just enjoy the flick
0877180121|5.0|This item is a Christmas gift and it hasn't been given yet!  The quality of the product is good and it arrived in good shape.
B0058YPL66|5.0|THIS IS A CLASSIC SHOW!!!  NOTHING LIKE IT!  I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH SEASON 2 IN ITS ENTIRETY!!!  THE STORY LINE IS SO INTRIGUING!  IT KEEPS ME WANTING MORE!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Of most of the Solitaire games I've tried, this one seems to have better graphics and easier to use.  Thanks for the improvements.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|There has never been a Whitney Houston cd that I didn't love.  This one is no different.  Her voice is classic and the lyrics are beautiful.  She makes me feel every song!  I love you Nippy!  RIP MY LOVE!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Slightly different from the iPad version but I like the game well enough.  I like the layout of ge rooms that you can see which is not the case on the iPad version.  I'm not a fan of the whole room being dark but that adds to the mystery and challenge of the game.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|While I enjoyed the book and have read others in the Corey series, I am getting more than a little annoyed at the sarcasm of the main character. DeMIlle is simply trying too hard to inject inane comments from Corey. Let him be a serious, independent detective with a sarcastic streak rather than the opposite.
1401937519|5.0|A friend gave it to me to read while I was sick. It caused me to wonder why I brought on this sickness. I am<br />not afraid at all of crossing over.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Halfway through, Season 3 is much better than Season 2... more action, less soap opera drama, the acting seems better
B00000JCOV|5.0|I grew up as a Hip-Hop head. Listened more to R&B and Soul music. However, I have sinced ventured into a lot of genres of music. Slipknot is in my collection. While this is not for everyone. This is NOT garbage/junk as some people proclaim it to be. There is genuine raw emotion and energy involved behind this music. While I can't always listen to this music, day in, day out. There is a quality that has to be appreciated. There is art behind to it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really like this book. It was the bomb.<br /><br />It was awesome.<br />I really remember what I read. My book is the best of all of the books
B00003CXD5|5.0|One of Humphrey Bogart's best movies.  I had to watch it a few times to really get all the nuances, but once I did I really enjoyed all the banter and good acting.  This movie is a really good movie to watch if you're looking for a night in.  Get a pizza or some Chinese takeout, sit back and enjoy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The Spider Solitare game is my go to game when I need to unwind.  It's easy to use, fast and keeps me challenged.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I like the Maxell button/coin cells the best. The tolerances with the batteries are very tight.  I have a Mazda and the key fob needs one of these about every year.  The Sony batteries don't &#34;quite fit&#34; in the little holder inside the fob.  The Maxells fit perfectly, and last a long time.  I would highly recommend these batteries.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Too New Age for me where is Jesus? This book is lacking in reference to Jesus and providing a need to understand and accept Christ to be saved.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great movie that addresses issues that people face toward the end of life with uplifting humor.<br />The dvd arrived on time and as described. Would recommend to anyone.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I really enjoyed the Last Man and how interesting Flynn makes the action story. It only took me 2 days to read and for me that's a big deal! I couldn't put it down.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I normally dont listen to the hype - but this movie really wasn't as good as the other two batman movies. Bane sounded like an old man, there were relatively cheesy plot twists, and it just seemed they were too rushed when making it. It was very high quality streaming from Amazon, and the movie was entertaining - but good? No... not really.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Spoiler Alert ...? Spoler Alert  Spoiler Alert , Dont read this if your still have not seen this MOVIE.....?  I really loved this one Daniel Craig is awesome and he is still going to make another two Bond Movies.....? Shame they Replaced Q and dont have John Cleese anymore and I am still shocked/Sad that they killed of M Judy Dench she was trully amazing as M.....? Guess the Age...? Still great Story telling , great Action , somehow I was expecting  Sean Connery to show up in the last 20 - 30 min....??????  I give it 5 Stars WHY not making BOND in 3D next time......? even more livelike......? Would be soo cool...?
B009B1UZ4K|5.0|Kylie's voice on this album is absolutely gorgeous!  I purchased the vinyl version and the sound is stunning on this format. Also the booklet is beautiful and the full size of the record sleeve. The vinyl version also comes with a no frills CD version of the album.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Spoiler Alert at the end......? I bought this just for Fun and of course I like Sean Bean too....? But It took me nearly three Month befor I startet to watch....? Never had the right mood to start...? Finally I convinced myself lets watch one episode first......? Right from the opening Sound/Music and the first scene I was Blown away and really addicted.......?  Needless to say the whole first Season took me only three Days......? Go get it and be Surprised.....? But I was angry they really killed of Sean Bean.....? But I got over it because all the other Actors are Amazing/ Convincing too.....? I really like the little Guy....? BTW the Music is Amazing Im thinking of getting it....
B009HELT3C|3.0|Good movie but not much action as expected. Could have been better with some more action scenes. Found it little slow.
B00A12Z264|4.0|I chose this rating after listening the cd about 4 or 5 times in fact l im listening to it right now i t just cant stop. Christina doesn't let any one down on this album she has powerful songs that are very typical Christina and she also surprises us with a duet with a legendary country singer this cd has a little of everything in it
1449410243|5.0|More awesome sauce from The Oatmeal but this time it's cats and it's personal!  Seriously though, this is a fun read full of laugh out loud comic strips.    If you are a fan of The Oatmeal and want to support the author, BUY THIS BOOK!    If you have never heard of The Oatmeal, visit his website: [...] , read some comics, laugh out loud, and then come back here and BUY THIS BOOK!
B008EZVNFE|4.0|I am not going to go into a thorough review of this album, but let me say that I love 80% of it...  The other 20% is decent, but does not maintain consistency or flow with the better tracks.  It is obvious that the recording engineers knew what they were doing, because of the tremendous depth and detail in the audio quality.  Also, I should give kudos to the bassist, especially as it relates to track 8 on the CD, which happens to be my favorite segment of the whole album. The title of track 8 is Elusive and was written by Scott Matthews. Lianne's interpretation of Elusive is nothing short of breathtaking.  Overall, I am happy to have this in my collection!
B0083EM24C|5.0|I was first drawn to Passion Pit by its song &#34;Sleepyhead&#34; and completely hooked with &#34;Moth's Wings&#34; causing me to buy their first full length album, &#34;Manners&#34;.  Of course, when heard they had a new album, I had to buy it.  This new album did not disappoint.  For those who are already into Passion Pit, you already know some of their songs are quite unique and may take a couple listens to digest and eventually grow on you but this one has several that grab onto you right away.  My personal favorite (and you may of already heard it on the radio) is the opening song, &#34;Take a Walk&#34; which really hits home with me as it is about things going wrong and blowing off steam/getting away for a moment.  Anyway, if you are a Passion Pit fan or just want to try something new or unique,  I would recommend you giving this album a shot.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I really enjoyed this story, I originally bought it for my grandchildren and have them see it with me but I really enjoyed this little girl which reminded my of me and marriage. She made me laugh and cry and my grandchildren did not know why I was acting like that. I highly recommand this video, a lot of action.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Although my wife and I both have solitaire on our computers and play them a lot, having it on the Kindle means we can play it anytime, anywhere.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|my daughter and i had a blast putting these on the walls.... her room now looks like a lil girls room
B007UWBQEU|4.0|Carrie has done it again with this album. In my opinion, she has the best female voice in the world. Sounds great on the Kindle. The sale price was a steal from Amazon.
1419702238|4.0|this is a gift for grandson  so i can not comment on the item itself just hope he will like it
6301978137|4.0|I've always enjoyed all the Conan movies.  It is nice that there is one with a  woman instead of a man as the hero.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin continues to do it again, and deliver a beautifully written drama of the characters we have grown to know and love. And if you didn't love them before, you will either hate them even more and surprise yourself with your adoration of them.  Old characters, new characters, and supernatural events you couldn't have imagined at all will keep you frantically turning the pages through this thrill of a novel. Also, Martin will kill people off in a heartbeat, because he's an amazing author and will never deliver a predictable solution to the mess this game of thrones has made.  My absolute FAVORITE of the series, Storm of Swords, will continue to help your obsession with Westeros, and spark your interest even further.
B008D19WBQ|3.0|My husband and i love friends! we watch it everynight, our dvd series was well used and starting to skip so we decided it a<br />was time to upgrade. This boxed set was a great deal. We were a little disappointed that the episodes werent the extended versions we had grown to love on our dvd series. That is my one only complaint on this boxed series, they should have left the exteneded episodes,, did they think that loyal viewers wouldnt notice??
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|I and all of the folks that I am around listen to this album and LOVE it. I'm 65 yrs old and have all of Adam's music and videos and this album plays all the time in my SUV and at my job and on my Kindle Fire and on my computer. All of the teenagers and twenty year olds in my life LOVE this album and of course, LOVE Adam. Can't wait to see and hear what he writes and performs on his next album. Wish the critics would listen closer to the words and music of this album. We, the audience. do. Love and acceptance to and for ALL.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|All you can really say is that it calculates when you need it to.  FYI - There are ads appear when using.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a good moody cd. I absolutely adore her voice and this album is the same, powerful voice and catchy, yet moody lyrics. Buy it and you wont be sorry.
0689835604|5.0|The book is super cute and is in great condition and my niece will love it.  It is not your typical book and that is what I like about it.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Works perfectly. At the time of this writing you will need to sideload the io.vov.vitamo plug-in by downloading it separately. The link that's given for the download in the app, itself, is down temporarily. I ended up buying the pro version for the few extra features and to support the author who did, in my opinion, a very fine job. Don't know what the other viewers are fussing about. Works great on my Kindle Fire 7\\" (2nd gen).
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Perfect for the Kindle Fire HD screen. No smudges.  Works great. I just bought two Kindle Fire HD (1 for wife - 1 for me) which was my first tablet purchase.  Didn't have much of a clue of finger vs stylus, so I purchased three different brands of stylus, just to be sure. They were the same or of a greater price.  IMO the finger is best for reading, the stylus is best for all other tablet use. This stylus beats the other sylus I bought hands down.  How so?  Comes with 5mm, 6mm and 7mm size tip ends. I like the 6mm, wife likes the 7mm and we both like the 5mm for some puzzle games.  Has a great feel when in use.  The other two stylus had just one tip.  I'll be buying more of these to have on hand with my next Amazon purchase. Highly recommend. . December 6, 2015 Wow! It's now three years later and this stylus just keeps on going and gets lots of use.
0307887960|3.0|Just another diet book.  Just as any other diet book, if you follow it you will lose the weight.  Doing more research on the diet as with other fad diets you are giving up something that you need and when you start eating all the other things that is not a part of this diet the weight comes back on.
B001NFNFF8|5.0|I am very much a fan of Tommy Lee Jones.  Have been for years.  He can do no wrong.  I love his character in just about all of his movies.  This was a great movie and the plot was excellent.
0060574216|4.0|I bought this book for reference material.  I really want more informaton about men and how they think and I heard that this is the book.
B000XVSU9O|5.0|Been reading and watching videos on NDEs for several years and this is by far the best book I've read.  Buying used copies to give away.  Everyone needs to know that death is not to be feared but the best day of their life!  She doesn't go on and on about her life but instead goes straight to the nde in detail.  You will learn!
B0091LS07E|4.0|I like Alicia Keyes and all of her music.  I can tell she is in love with this CD.  Nice CD
0375413405|5.0|This is great for learning how to cook! It gives you the basics and one you master those, making your own variations based on these concepts is easy.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A must have for the holiday season. Great story for parents and children. Wonderfully made.  The book is a must have too.
1469226405|2.0|I get that this is an homage to gothic novels, I really do. In light of this, I was prepared to overlook the constant gloomy descriptions, the numerous clichés, and the overused \\"introduce a mystery and immediately move on to introduce another mystery while leaving the reader hanging\\" technique. Having said all that, there really is no excuse for packing so much extraneous material in your novel that you bog down the plot, or for making caricatures out of your characters as opposed to actual life-like people. But mostly what bothered me about this book is that I read over 500 pages only to be told exactly what the outcome was going to be long before the reveal. This means that what should have been the most riveting part of the book simply got skimmed, since it added absolutely nothing to the plot, the character development, or my understanding/enjoyment of the novel. Truly wanted to enjoy this book, now I'm just glad it's over and I can move on to something else.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|I have always liked many of Clarkson's tunes, but this CD is A-one on every song!!  It's a more mature sound from her. It's always great to see a new young artist grow in their music and not stay stuck in the mode that continues to only attract the young ones!  This is definitely worth checking out!!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Not what I was expecting. Lost interest and put<br />It down. May try again. Was looking for the action implied<br />By the movie trailers.
0756688701|5.0|My son has had this book for a few months now and it NEVER gets old. He is 2 and loves to look through the pages and find the cars that he has, and then let me know the ones he wants (which can be kind of expensive LOL)....<br /><br />The book has a lot of information about each car, and tells you if they are rare or not. It gives you a background for all the characters, and can really keep your kids busy....<br /><br />This is the 2nd one we purchased, this time it's a gift :)
0545265355|5.0|Very strong social context. Very well written. The language itself is very simple and easy to read almost on any reading level, but the context is not simple at all.
B000Q67876|4.0|i would of gave this blu-ray 5 stars if it werent for the packaging. i got mine in the mail a couple of hours ago and found that the case that held the blu-ray was damaged. :[ its still an amazing movie. im just sad that i got mine damaged, hopefully everyone else will have better luck.
0765317389|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading really good books, both intelligent and fast paced. Card's Ender series and Shadow series are unique among all science fiction books in that he writes about children and family relationships, not just of lonely (adult) male heroes as most of other SCI-FI writers do.<br /><br />I also find the author himself being honest, courageous, sharp, and conservative enough. I certainly share the same values.<br /><br />The latest Ender in Exile is also very good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|5 stars because the writing is excellent, the characters are well developed, the story line is fascinating and the zombies are creepy.  The only complaint I would have is the CGI is tacky.  Takes away from the raw story.  But I'm hooked and I'm not a TV watcher at all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this on my Kindle. After all the hype, and several friends' recommendations, I was just expecting more. I liked it, but wasn't wowed. I really didn't like any of the characters, and when that happens it's always sort of a struggle.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This is reassuring \\"Aha!\\" material, and yet it resonates where we've long suspected was the boring truth.  Just as weight loss has no healthy shortcuts, but relies on the dependable disciplines of good nutrition and exercise with rest, so does financial health. A must-read for anyone ready to take a fresh look at the virtues of frugality, saving and living happily below one's means as the vehicle to wealth.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much I immediately got the sequel and preorder the third one. All I can say is wow and where is this man.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Movie is enjoyable if you are able to suspend your disbelief in a few areas. Homage is paid to the original boardgame, and it actually works in the movie.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it and play it all the time! a great app for everyone!! Ads are a problem though but it rox overall
B001Y8WAJ6|5.0|One of my favorite Saxon cd's. I saw them in concert when this cd first came out and it still rocks today.
B006LXQID8|5.0|This is my favourite French flick of all time! I really love it because it's great for practising my French and it is SO MUCH fun! I would highly recommend this movie!
1419705849|5.0|I actually like to read these books after my son reads it.  They're very entertaining.  I know all kids will like it!
B005QPGHQU|5.0|I love evanescence any, but this album by far the best!I highly recommend, if you love amy lee, this album is for you!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Ten  minutes into the movie I knew I had to get it for my 13-year-old granddaughter. It was a great story, entertainingly told, wiith awesome graphics.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Didn't know how they were going to put Lincoln and vampires together but they did and it was fun to watch.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This was a great tie-up to the MIB series. Loved the K character as a young man--well played, for sure.
B001BANK32|4.0|I'm only about 3/4 of the way through, but so far this book has been nothing short of awesome.  King does a great job of bringing us into the minds of the main characters and has been raising and lowering the tension throughout the novel so far.  Definitely recommended.
B001O53BK6|4.0|Wow.  What a movie.  It's a great reminder that you are never to old to do what you love. Wow
B007EECSFA|5.0|Midway in the book I thought perhaps I wasn't going to like this as well as her other books, then the story twisted again and I was pleasantly surprised to find it is another great one by Kate Morton.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Honestly, I love this game. It's very easy at first, then it becomes a fun challenge that kills time. I recommend it for anyone who is bored on a car trip, or bored during a flight.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I have always been a big Papa Roach fan and just like all their other CD's they do not disappoint. Every song and beat and guitar riff on it is well done. Would recommend this  for any Papa Roach fan.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|addiction comes in many forms, across all ages, for many different reasons - a riveting portrayal of descent and destruction
B00127RAJY|3.0|I tried this for a week and finally couldn't take it anymore, I had such severe shin splints that I had to stop doing it altogether. I stopped for a week and tried to go back but had the same problem again. I've not picked it back up unfortunately because I'm afraid the same thing is going to start happening again. Instead of using this I just went and got a gym membership and lost 45 pounds that way. I loved the video the first several days and you really do feel it especially in your tummy but my goodness the pain in my shins was awful. I purchased this to help me lose baby weight and tone my stomach. I used two cans of white beans instead of weights. My 4 year old saw me doing it and went in the kitchen to grab her own campbell soup cans and did some of the exercise too. She thought it was fun. You will sweat for sure! I had my husband rip this onto his computer and stream it though the apple tv so I could do it on any of our tv's in the house while the baby slept. I have not tried level 2 or 3 out of fear for my shins which I honestly do not feel need a workout. It's my butt and tummy that need the work!
B005HJU7HA|4.0|one of the gems of free books - hours of pleasure, waiting for my next holiday to be able to savour this
B0057R5XRG|5.0|The packaging is good and sturdy, and I always like the digital copy. The Blu-Ray &#34;conversion&#34; is well done with great sound and a crisp picture.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is one of the few albums I have pre-ordered, and it was definitely worth it.  The music is different enough from &#34;Sigh No More&#34; for it to easily stand out (and it did take me a couple of listens to get used to it) but it is still very much Mumford and Sons.  The special edition is well worth the extra money-  the extra three tracks are all strong and are some of my favorites, especially &#34;For Those Below.&#34;  Highly recommend this album.
0316228532|5.0|Listening to an audio version of this book, I realized that i can only do it in the complete privacy of my car! Compelling, brilliant and shuddering at times. Sometimes i will ask myself: how does she know and how could she write in such a precision and pointedly about each character and the complexity of their interactions. Myself, being in Andrew's shoes very long time ago, it literally shocked me - the exact detail and the similarity of situations. I thought that it was all behind me and all forgotten......it took my breath away.....
B008RV5K5E|4.0|So it doesn't measure up to the graphic novel. But then, other than the Watchmen novel, what other story really could? They removed the first-person narration by Bruce. So the visual grittiness and darkness is lacking a little. So they lengthened it into two volumes instead of one. So Peter Weller isn't the right voice.<br /><br />Regardless...I was skeptical based on the reviews on here but when I continued watching I couldn't help but be pulled in to the story and actually be riveted by it. It's not as earth-moving or seminal as the graphic novel but the source material was written twenty plus years ago and rewrote and repainted the Batman mystique. We've had the 1989 Batman and the Nan trilogy so it's unfair to expect similar impact from this medium. But it's still a decently enjoyable animated film. Looking fwd to volume 2
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I started watching this series on a whim and could not get enough of it.  As you watch, the episodes get better and better as well as the seasons.  The cast is superb.  Love it!
B009YJEKJK|5.0|Great album, wonderful Christmas songs. And the price is just right for downloading songs for this Christmas season. Thank you.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Only in a foreign country do they get away with these kinds of stunts. Non-Stop urban combat and martial arts.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|When you open the app it only shows the first 10 or so state's etc....After that they are just blue boxes. This needs fixed!!!! VERY ANNOYING
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I thought by spending over $50 on this case I would be getting a good product, but I guess not! Ive dropped it a couple of times and since most of it is made of plastic it has cracked in several places making it no longer waterproof!<br />I would not recommend this product to anyone who wants a high quality waterproof iphone case!
B0015AARJI|1.0|Control is not original. Control is pirated. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! you sold me a poor quality product. sold me a poor quality product
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was my favorite Kate Morton book so far.  I have read two others and this was was less predictable and kept you going to the very end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this on netflix and ever since then I could not stop watching it.but I am to lazy to write alot about it.lol
0425263908|5.0|If you thought Fifty Shades was a good you must read Bared To You.  I really think Bared To You is much better.  Can't wait to read the next sequel Reflected In You.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've been reading this book at the same time as I'm reading Ray Kurzweil's book on how to create a mind. What is so interesting about Eben's book is his insistence, based on his experiences while he was in a coma, that the mind and consciousness is not dependent on the brain. Skeptics will still argue that his experiences arose from a recovering brain as he emerged from his coma. However, the vividness and profundity of these experiences do not correlate with a brain that has been badly damaged by meningitis. Further, the experiences suggest an afterlife that is even more real than the one we experience in this life. So, while humanity may build a non-biological intelligence that exceeds the abilities of the physical brain, it may still be missing that special ingredient that allows humans to go beyond life in a physical body.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf has become one of my favorite Christmas movies ever and is a MUST watch every year. Me and my family will watch this movie every Christmas season probably for the next 40 years, love it!
1451695195|2.0|Very clinical with  not enough emphasis on the journey into the afterlife. It reads as if it were written by a doctor
B003SNKBXW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have read many of Perez-Reverte's novels and liked every one. This one has all the things I love in fiction: old books. book lovers, the occult, mystery. Because there are two different story lines intertwining, separating, coming back together again, it is a bit disconcerting at first but eventually you catch on. Perez-Reverte is a true bibliophile with an encyclopedic knowledge of printing, history, book making and, especially, The Three Musketeers. How he manages to bring together that particular book with the occult (summoning of the devil) is the real mystery. This is one of those books that keeps you up until the wee hours because you just can't wait to see how everything comes together.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved reading the 50 Shades of Gray Trilogy, and the final book definitely didn't disappoint! It was probably my favorite of the 3.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I cannot get it to work on either my SAmsung Galaxy tablet and my iPad!!! Everytime I go to download my book, I keep getting we don't recognize a valid kindle reading app on this device. This eventhough I uninstall and reinstall. Yet in Amazon, my devices are shown and registered.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Stray Souls has a great storyline and is scary at times. I loved the graphics and it always kept your attention ! This is a must if you like hidden object games, it has plenty of them ! There is a bonus game afterwards and so worth the money !
B008NABUU8|5.0|I like the zoom detail, it's very helpful. You must pay about $2 to unlock unlimited building materials, but I think it's worth it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's a great game to play when you want to get your mind off things. There are a variety of game themes that you can play, some are easy and there are ones that are not so easy.  I recommend it for all ages !
B0083P1QUM|4.0|You can never go wrong with a Scarpetta Novel.  I love the writing style and know that it will lead to other stories.  It was a bit of a stretch for the bone bed for the story line but worked in the end.
B00913DPW2|5.0|The Haunt definitely kept your attention ! There were surprises in the game that made me jump and gave me goosebumps !  I love a good challenge and this was definitely it !
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The writing kept you involved but didn't like the idea of bad guys getting away with such a grand scam.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|First time reading this and loved it. I've always l loved the movie, so I thought I should read the book.
B008Z9L94O|2.0|The packaging is exquisite.  Beautiful artwork and interesting liner notes from Billy Corgan.  But this is about the music.  I have waited to get this album on vinyl for years, and I hate to tell everyone that the quality of this (my) vinyl is horrible.  I have only listened to half the tracks but can confirm that Zero, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Here Is No Why, (An Ode to No One), and X.Y.U. all appear to have weird clicks and skips in the tracks.  From my listen, it seems that quieter songs such as Thirty-Three and Stumbline play fine.  Never experienced anything like this.<br /><br />Hope everyone has better luck, but back to the iPod for me I guess.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Great read for the 30+ gamer, and something about i need to write more words silly system makes sillly rewiew
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This was a great movie to watch and I will recommend this to everyone I know.<br /><br />Look like it would be good<br /><br />Keep up the good work, package was great and received movie on time
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was a different role then I am used to seeing George in.<br />It'll make you laugh and make you cry.  Not at all what I expected.  Hope you enjoy
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Not done with the whole edition but will likely finish it.  This is more of a mystery than an action packed sci-fi adventure.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book had me so hooked (I read it in one week) I thought it was going to be the same with this one. This one took me longer because I was getting bored with the same thing, sex, sex sex (yes some people may find that interesting) but it was the same descriptions over and over again it got me tired. I only finished it because I wanted to keep learning on the plot of the story. Which by the way is just a story, this would NEVER happen in real life.
B004EPYZT4|2.0|I'm not terribly familiar with the Conan series, although I know the basic plot and some of the characters. I can see why people enjoy the stories and the original film; they had a fantasy charm that was larger than life and provided some fun and memorable moments. That makes it all the more puzzling why this reboot exists, although with the state Hollywood is in these days I guess I'm not surprised. In short: this film is great for a laugh but serves little purpose beyond that. The characters are one-dimensional and completely uninteresting, meaning that it's hard to feel any connection to them. A majority of the players serve no purpose and by the end you'll probably forget who's who or lose your ability to care.<br /><br />The story itself is simplistic and the action sequences serve no real purpose other than to keep the viewer interested. I can't recall a single battle or fight that got me emotionally invested or felt like it had any bearing on the plot. Each one was the same thing: Conan yells and randomly charges in, a mediocre battle with shaky-cam editing ensues, and then it's off to the next one. There are some gory deaths along the way that aim to be creative but fall flat. Like the battles, they feel unnecessary and grow old rather quickly.<br /><br />However, it's the CGI that stands out. Not because it's superb but due to it being painfully bad. Granted, most CGI is noticeable to the human eye and often has trouble seamlessly blending into a film. Here it's just laughable and far to obvious. The original looked gritty and at least gave you the impression that it was a living, breathing world. Modern technology, as great as it may be, has ruined a lot of this effect and this movie is a prime example of what happens when you take a big budget and put spectacle over story. The pacing, effects, and characters are just awful. The film attempts to be epic and instead reeks of having too many haphazard elements thrown together without fleshing any of them out.<br /><br />I started laughing within the first ten seconds and that continued for the entire duration. My wife and I enjoy having bad movie nights once in a while and this film certainly fits the bill. It's terrible but at least fun enough to laugh at as mindless entertainment, hence the two star rating. Just watch it on Netflix and save the room on your shelf for something worthwhile..<br /><br />I started laughing within the first ten seconds and that continued for the entire duration.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book so fast (one week, which is really fast for me) because it had me completely hooked.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Excellent movie. I have enjoyed the Nolan/ Bale films as much as the Tim Burton version of the first Batman. This is saying a lot as I still enjoy the Michael Keaton batman. After Michael Keaton hung up the cape the films went downhill fast. They became campy again and didn't have the dark tone that is important for Batman. I was really excited when Batman Begins came out. It was an awesome way to bring back the Dark Knight. It really put him back to his roots again. I really hope that whoever picks up the torch to make more Batman films really does their homework and is a fan of comics and Batman. It's really hard to do an excellent super hero movie without that mindset. The only complaint I have against The Dark Knight Rises is the sound quality of the dialogue. I don't know if it's just me or not, but in the Theater as well as watching it at home I had a really hard time understanding the dialogue between the characters. Especially Bane. I could make it out enough to follow the action but it was really difficult. Awesome movie other than that. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|First book was really good and interesting, read it in one week. The second one started to get me bored with the same sex drama and the unrealistic plot the main characters. This third book I havent even finished reading! Enough with the same sex scenes, I actually skipped reading them and it's been a month and still havent finished the book. Big disappointment.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is an amazing novel. It's set in Maycomb County, Alabama, and is the story of Jean Louise \\"Scout\\", who is seven years old at the beginning of the story. Her brother Jem is a few years older than her and her father Atticus is a lawyer. To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Scout's adventures, also of a pivotal trial between Tom Robinson, a black man, and the Ewells, a \\"white trash\\" family. Atticus is defending Tom Robinson, causing much controversy, and much taunting for his children. Also that year, Jem and Scout begin a long fascination with the mysterious Boo Radley, who is supposedly crazy, and is shut up in the house.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely one of my favorite novels. The subject matter is really gripping and I love the writing. Scout narrates in an amazing voice; very compelling. Much like Margaret Mitchell, Harper Lee is a Southern writer, and only wrote one novel (though she is still alive). I wish she wrote more.<br /><br />One of my favorite sequences is probably the trial. Atticus is so brilliant; he builds up a big case for Tom Robinson, and yet racial prejudice prevails, despite the fact that there was no concrete evidence that Tom committed the crime. It's really sad, but one of the most riveting parts of the novel. Even if, like me, you knew what was going to happen, you still couldn't put the book down. And for Scout and particularly Jem, who are so sure that Tom will be acquitted, it's a huge blow.<br /><br />I love the characters as well; Scout is inquisitive and fearless, and I like Atticus a lot too. To Kill a Mockingbird is an amazing American classic, and I would highly recommend it. I love everything about this novel, from the setting, to the subject matter, to the characters, to the writing.<br /><br />My blog is located at novareviews.blogspot.com. You can read all of my reviews there.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|Corey and the crew keep it up on their latest installment. Lots of hard rocking and smart lyrics and the addition of a few more personal moments (Taciturn) makes the album pretty well rounded. I would recommend.
B009JBZH54|5.0|As opposed to some other reviews, I had all the correct discs thankfully.  Excited to watch them but this review is simply for the packaging, features, and price.  3 blu rays plus 2 special feature discs and a cinema art book (which is really cool) all for $27, not bad at all.  I'm sure they will put out another trilogy at some point but as long as the movie qualities are great, this set will do just fine for me as a lover of this trilogy.  Great service from amazon as always.  Excited to watch the films and will update on quality.
B00A993UWM|5.0|One word to describe this record. HOT! This record is full of fun, should have been released over the summer. Love Ya girl. Lets party...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very well written.  You came to either love or hate the characters.  Yes a bit violent, but all comes together in the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Daughter is truly enjoying the ebook. thank you.  I will definetly order from this seller in the future. Thank you
B003O86FMW|4.0|Story carried on from the first book just like it never ended.  Found this one even more interesting, and at the end started the last one immediately.  Lots of action, romance, and suspence.
0525478817|5.0|This book opened my eyes about kids with cancer. I never wanted to think about it before, but this book insists! These characters are perfecly created in the author's mind, and then presented to the rest of us as a gift, so we can also empathize with their view, their parent's viewpoints, their friends (some didn't support or stick with them as they'd promised) and their disappointments. John Green has an compassion for these sick kids with a short life expectance, and he knows how to write about it so his readers can gain the most from their story. I'm going to read everything John Green has written. He is a unique Young Adult author.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Honestly i love these books and read them as soon as they come out. I wasn't crazy about the story line with Mitch in this one, but not enough to lose a review star.  And his line towards the beginning when that woman asks him if he thinks she's stupid?  Priceless.
0812992784|5.0|My son went to see Rusdie speak on one occasion when he was at the University of Iowa. I bought him this book as a gift, and he enjoyed the entire read.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Not going to review the movie, everyone knows it is perfect.<br />The picture is phenomenal, crisp, clear and flawless. The special features are great, especially about the restoration.<br /><br />A must have for a blu-ray collection.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Upon hearing Angry Birds was tackling Star Wars in their own unique way I was very excited. I knew they would handle the beloved property very well incorporating their own brand of humor into the gameplay. This is exemplified by Angry Birds makeovers of iconic ships like the X-Wing, Tie-Fighter, and Death Star. The gameplay is just as much fun as you'd expect from Angry Birds and then some. When you give an angry bird a lightsaber fun is sure to be had!

B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Some things to remember: there is no proof brain exercise programs work, and some &quot;exercises&quot; popular in such programs (such as sudoku) are absolutely entertainment. Brain studies show intensive training in specialist fields over many years can expand the brain. This is not the program you want for this.<br /><br />As entertainment, it is excellent. As warm-up exercises for mental quizzes, it is good.
0824835921|5.0|I guess everyone has already said this, but I love this system. This is a system that works best for those that have learned well in the past from mnemonics, songs, and other 'association' strategies. If you remember PEMDAS better as the actual mathmetical words, rather than the cutesy rhyme your teacher taught you, this book doesn`t make sense for you. However, I am a wordsy person, and this system really helped me to see the connections in building kanji, almost like root words and prefixes and suffixes being combined in the English language. It really opened up a difficult subject for me. It could work if you are learning sentence structures in a traditional Japanese course at the same time, but I think it is more logical to learn vocabulary and then learn how to utilize it. If you think about it, children first learn words, then learn sentences. It is just the way most humans think. (If you were the kid that waited until they were four to say anything, then spouted all these complex sentences, this system probably isn`t your bag.) But if you are like me, you`ll want to go through all of the remembering the kanji series, (I`m pretty sure the advanced ones eventually go into pronunciation, but that`s just a guess) then step into sentence structure. I tried a traditional course before, but got horribly lost in weird sentence structures. I am starting fresh and clean with this book, and am excited by how much more progress I`ve made in a few months than 2 hopeless years in a classroom!
B006O7XOOW|1.0|I could not force my one year old to play with this. She took a look then seen it really does nothing, and went to play with the puppy ride on. That's all  have to say. It does nothing. They get annoyed with having to chase after the balls cause they don't stay in the side trays, they tend to fall on the floor and roll away. So yeah, boring toy. But then again my kids have ipod at 1 and 2, they learn more from them. My 2 year old can count to 22 between our guidance and awesome ABC mouse learning apps...

3836528347|5.0|Within the slipcase lurk two stunning, oversize hardback collections of Mad Men era adverts. By my count, the teal '50s volume which features a perfectly-suited male on the cover, runs to 320 pages. The orange '60s volume, featuring an impeccably dressed female, clocks in at 400 pages, including the index for both volumes. The contents for both volumes is in the first book, with a brief (3 page) preface by editor Jim Heimann, \\"Mad for Ads\\" in English, German, and French. There's also a four page intro. by Steven Heller in three languages called \\"Advertising in the 'Fifties: The Age of Affluence\\". The orange volume includes a four page piece by Heller, \\"So, What's the Big Idea?\\" The endpapers on the first volume give a brief advertising timeline from 1945-1959, with the second volume picking up at 1960-1970. In between the 13.5 X 10\\" covers are nothing but color drenched, full page ads from these two decades.<br /><br />So what's the problem? There isn't one, unless you already bought the numerous other Taschen volumes of ads from these decades. Even if you did (as I did), you may want this deluxe edition, if only for the presentation. The All American Ads volumes were even thicker than these hardbacks-- the '50s volume running over 900 pages [[ASIN:3822811580 All-American Ads of the 50s]]. There were also smaller, hardback editions in a series called The Golden Age of Advertising which were reprinted by Barnes and Noble, which I think are called Turtlebacks for some reason, but which tend to come up as \\"unknown binding\\" on Amazon. The '60s volume is about 350 pages [[ASIN:076079099X The 60s: The Golden Age of Advertising]]. Some of these ads also showed up in the series of pocket-sized books in the Taschen Icons line.<br /><br />Mid-Century Ads collects representative samples from Heimann's enormous ad stock from the '50s and '60s, but Taschen also put out books on other decades of advertising. Arguably, this is yet another attempt to cash in on the success of Mad Men, but as media critic Marshall McLuhan noted in the 'sixties, the artists of the day were all working on Madison Avenue. These two volumes, and the variations referred to above provide an endlessly fascinating introduction to two very different decades, and the allure of their inimitable style.en, but as media critic Marshall McLuhan noted in the 'sixties, the artists of the day were all working on Madison Avenue.

B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Ordered this for two HP printers.  HP wanted crazy amounts of money for their 'approved' memory, specs were identical and price was way less than HP.  Worked perfectly in both printers.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Heard Somebody like you track on the radio (best song this year  by any artist, by far), had to listen to more tracks from Gotye and found a few more that I really liked in this CD
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a great an afforable way of owing the series and don't have to find another place to store it with the rest of my already crowded dvd collection.  Its even available before being released at the stores too.  The picture quality was awesome, no delays of buffering and streaming what so ever.
B0053O89WY|5.0|While I have read other reviews from previous seasons that criticized the addition of more female castmates, I think the continued presence of Dr. Bernadette Rostenkowski and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler serves to add more levels of comedy and fun to the show. Mayim Bialik as Amy is especially entertaining, as a quirky mirror in behavior to Sheldon.  The Big Bang Theory continues to be one of our very favorite shows, and the DVDs we own are viewed over and over again.
B008BU70HW|5.0|An ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE for all Downton Abbey Fans.  This would make an excellent Christmas present!  Quick!  Before they are all gone.  This is an amazingly detailed book.  Not only is it beautifully presented .... think coffee table book..... the contents are just fantastic.  There is narrative, there is &#34;scrapbooking&#34; with pictures of things of the era, there is character analysis, it is just a great great book.  Do they have Emmy's for books?????  I give this TEN stars!

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I'm watching all of them with my mom. I think we've made it to season 4 or 5 so far. Her previous boyfriend didn't like the show and now we get to watch it with no peanut gallery or commentary.

B008K8X0IS|1.0|I gave it a star rating. The reason why is that the case was damaged. The plastic that holds the dvd was broke. One of the plastic cases could no longer hold in the dvd.

1451695195|5.0|In today's world of electronic interconnectedness, it's amazing how some ideas seem to go `Viral' and others don't. I kept hearing about this book from several avenues.  It was as if the Universe were saying, pay close attention, just as it did years ago when I kept hearing `[[ASIN:0976420066 A Course in Miracles-Original Edition]]' mentioned over and over or last year when I learned of [[ASIN:1401937519 Dying To Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing]]. It appears that this is another one of those `wake up calls' from [y/our] BEING.  And so it is!<br /><br />The most significant facets of this Near Death Experience [NDE] are:<br /><br />*  The person who experienced it was a skeptical neurosurgeon scientist.<br />*  The CORTEX of his brain was not functioning yet he experienced crystal clear clarity.<br />*  He had a complete and total recovery from E. coli meningitis, which is a medical miracle.<br /><br />We may have seen television shows regarding NDE's which often begin with phenomenal claims of other worldly experiences and end with a scientific de-bunking using medical science of the brain to prove it was `all in their head.' The evidence the scientists present is offered in an effort to show that there IS no `scientific proof' that these experiences were anywhere but in the physical brain. This is exactly how Eben [Dr. Alexander] thought until his own first-hand experience of an NDE.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander writes: \\"The more I read of the \\"scientific\\" explanations of what NDE's are, the more I was shocked by their transparent flimsiness. And yet I also knew with chagrin that they were exactly the ones that the old \\"me\\" would have pointed to vaguely if someone had asked me to \\"explain\\" what an NDE is.\\"<br /><br />You may have see Dr. Alexander on Oprah, NBC, ABC, Fox, Cover of Newsweek etc. Why is he out there is such a big way? He answers that question himself:<br /><br /> \\"Without recovering that memory of our larger connectedness, and of the unconditional love of our Creator, we will always feel lost here on earth.\\" P.171<br /><br />Dr. Eben Alexander, husband, father, neurosurgeon  contracted the extremely rare condition of E. coli meningitis completely out of the blue. Only 1 in 10 Million people will do the same. He made a full recovery one month after lying in a coma, near death, for seven days. This book is his best attempt at trying to share an experience which was truly beyond words.<br /><br />As the book progresses, his story becomes an exquisite tapestry.  The experiences of his family and friends and doctors in the hospital, dealing with this grave E coli infection, are interwoven with a recounting of Eden's experience as a consciousness, with no connection to the past, in a `place' where words could never do it justice.<br /><br />Even though it kept the attention of the reader by the vacillating between the solid world that we know and the ephemeral albeit Real world that Eben was experiencing, it wasn't until toward the end of the book that I found myself grabbing for the tissues.<br /><br />There is a part of Eben's life that I have not mentioned and it has everything to do with the message he received and more importantly the Being who brought the message to him. Now I leave that mystery of WHO that was for you to discover, dear reader, although the message itself is for all to know and to remember.<br /><br />\\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.\\"<br />\\"You have nothing to fear.\\"<br />\\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\\"<br /><br />~ Reja Janaki Joy Green<br />  Omaha, NEnd of the unconditional love of our Creator, we will always feel lost here on earth.\\" P.171<br /><br />Dr. Eben Alexander, husband, father, neurosurgeon  contracted the extremely rare condition of E. coli meningitis completely out of the blue.

B0012TWRAO|5.0|This base mount is a great product.  I have three of the ball mounts, a handheld GPS holder and a quick release strut from RAM mount. I can move my GPS from bikes to boat.  It is easy to remove the GPS.  The zinc coated may not be the best choice for high salt humidity, but only time will tell.  After one year on bike in Florida no issues.  Popping the GPS in and out of the holder made me nervious at first but, this stuff is rugged, and the plastic GPS holder has held up well.  All nice products I recommend them.
0441013597|4.0|It's widely considered to be the best science fiction book ever written.  While I mostly agree with these most enthusiastic reviews, I believe that Dune has a few small points that detract from the overall work.  I believe that Frank Herbert crafted a work that has (and will continue to) influence science fiction dramatically.<br /> The book begins as the ancient House of Atreides is preparing to leave their longtime home of Caladan, for the desert planet Arrakis.  The majority of humanity belongs to a variety of major and minor houses and their constituent populations on their planets.  The governing figure is the Emperor Shaddam IV.  There are other forces in play, such as the mysterious Bene Gesserit (a secretive cult of women with special mental powers, whose goal is to ensure the genetic diversity of humanity), the Fremen (a mysterious civilization of desert-dwellers, who seek to revitalize Arrakis), and the many plots between the various houses and the emperor.  The House Harkonnen plots with the emperor to eliminate the House Atreides (ridding the emperor of a potential opponent, and ridding the Harkonnens of their centuries-old feud).  The Duke Leto Atreides is assassinated, and his son, Paul, flees to the deepest desert, where he joins the Fremen, and leads them in an assault against the forces of the emperor and the Harkonnens on Arrakis.<br /> Obviously, this book was received well, sparking one of the largest fanbases for a book.  The book has many sequels (as well as a few prequels), that create what has become the \\"Duniverse.\\"  This massive community has influenced science fiction since the \\"new wave\\" of sci-fi, and many famous works have connections to it, such as the Star Wars saga and Lord of the Rings.<br /> Possibly one of the greatest reasons for the appeal of the novel is that it doesn't fit with other traditional types of science fiction.  Most sci-fi books feature civilizations based off of technology much more advanced or much less advanced than ours.  Whereas most of the technology in Dune is more advanced that what we have, at the same time, it is less advanced (due to the fact that advanced computing is banned.  Computational skills are taught to a select group of \\"Mentats\\").  This odd paradox draws fans into the book, much like a Penrose triangle draws the interest of mathematicians.<br /> As good as the novel is, it has its flaws.  There are many points where the book skips decades in between chapters, leaving the reader confused and disoriented until they realize that several years have passed.  Herbert also describes psychic events as Paul gazes into the future to look upon the oncoming war, or when he looks within himself into the \\"dark place where no woman can look.\\"  These parts, as interesting as they are, are also problem sections.  Herbert does his best to describe these mystic powers, but, more often than not, the descriptions end up confusing the reader, leaving them to guess feebly at what is really happening.  And, possibly the most annoying, is the ending.  The book builds to a massive climax as the Fremen prepare for their final assault on the emperor and the Harkonnens, and the book reaches a most abrupt ending, which leaves the reader wondering why it took so long to get from the climax of the novel to this unsatisfying end.<br /> For the most part, I do agree with the wide-eyed fans and critics who regard this novel as the best sci-fi novel ever; nevertheless I hold a few small reservations on certain parts of the book.  I believe that Herbert created possibly the most important works of science fiction (rivaling famous works such as The Forbidden Planet) and its influence will continue to be felt in future works for years to come.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first two. It became redundant and the author kept repeating herself....if I read &#34;stop biting your lip&#34; or &#34;Mr. Grey/ Mrs. Grey&#34; one more time I am going to literally scream! I get it....

B009VB9VKY|2.0|I was so excited to see this movie, until I actually watched it.  I was not impressed with the movie at all, and not about not having enough nudity because that is not what I was looking for.  I was just not liking the entire plot of the movie I really liked Channing Tatum in 21 Jump street and was expecting more.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Saw this exact one in best buy for $99.99, Amazon had it for $66.00, no brainer purchased from Amazon and had product in 2 days. It fits my Dell 17.3 laptop.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|When I got the movie in the mail I thought it was new because it had a clear wrap over it, but when I played it for the first time last night in the DVD player for the second half of the movie it was skipping. The second half probably took 10 minutes. I am very upset, that I had paid for it and got this result. When I took the disc out to clean it, there are deep scuffs right in the inner ring, where the movie plays.<br />I love harry potter, and this movie is great for the final ending BUT this product was scratched, and I would not buy from this company again. I bought this product on the 25th, so shipping was acceptably, but not the fastest

B007THA4FI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I have seen all of the Harry Potter movies but never read the books, perhaps that is why it was so easy for me to love this book!  Its very well written, nothing left to the imagination, and it leaves you wanting more.  Kudos to JK and I hope she continues on with her adult book writing.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very good read.  Not only a good John Corey story but so much interesting culture along with mid-easten living and expectations from people visiting and woking there.  Research was also very mind blowing sometimes.  Thoroughly enyoyed/
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this book in 24 hours flat...and not because it was short, because it definitely isn't.  It's JUST THAT good.  There is no disputing that what Dr Alexander experienced was real and was not a hallucination.  This book eased any fear I have of passing on, and reassured me that I will see my loved ones again!  Get this book now, you won't regret it!
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Led Zeppelin as strong as ever. I've had the package a week now and have watched it three times so far.  Robert Plant's voice is amazing after all these years, Jimmy Paige as passionate as ever, John Paul Jones glues it all together and Jason Bonham completely lived up to his father's legacy. In my opinion it is the best DVD of a rock group I have ever seen,  you can actually watch it without getting dizzy from all the camera moves and angles trying to be artistic!  Loved every minute of it!

B003XRDYX2|4.0|\\"Hey, Peter Paul, help me out tonight will you? Jenny's cousin Joslyn is in town. Lynette promised her she could go with us to the Oleo Coffeehouse tonight and she needs a date. She is supposed to be nice and since she is from New York City she knows all about the folk scene there and about all the latest folk singers and poems and stuff,\\" Jeff Murphy quick- talked (the only way he knew) over the phone to his high school friend Peter Paul Markin. Peter was intrigued by this prospect for he had over the previous several months got caught up in the emerging 1962 folk wave then splashing through young America so he said sure.<br /><br />Peter Paul, as was his way in those days around girls (and around his more intellectual friends) dug into his pile of folk music, folk records and folk newsletters in order to be able to carry on a civil conversation with Joslyn that night. He was especially nervous that he know every arcane fact in the folk world to impress a New York City girl who had actually been to Mecca, the Village, his idea of folk chic. Funny, he thought to himself,  a year or so before he used to laugh at what he called \\"beats,\\" guys with beards, bad hair, bad breathe, baggy pants and brown flannel shirts when he took his midnight swings through Harvard Square.<br /><br />He was strictly a rock and roll man, or maybe a little, be-bop blues as they filtered out of Mister Lee's Blues Hour from Chicago on the radio on Sundays night when the wind was right. One Sunday he was trying to get that station (always a fickle proposition on his transistor radio) when he heard this gravelly-voiced guy singing something out of some old mountain hollows or something like that, a song called Come All You Fair And Tender Ladies. They guy singing it, whom he later found out was Dave Von Ronk from Brooklyn, sounded like some latter day Jehovah calling his flock home. Peter Paul was hooked and listened to the whole show. He didn't remember all the names of the songs or performersbut the next day he went to Charlie's Records over in Adamsville Center and picked up what that shop considered folk, some Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie stuff and he was double-hooked.<br /><br />That date night he went with Jeff, Lynette and Joslyn and had a good time. Although she was indeed as nice as advertised she had a problem, a Peter Paul eyes problem. She was way too knowledgeable about the folk scene for Peter. At one point he was sitting there in silence as she went on and on about the Village. Mostly what she said was that a new wave was coming, we, meaning us, the kids then, were ready to bust out and make a newer world and folk music would be the cement that united us. Powerful stuff.<br /><br />She said that a young guy, a young guy hanging around the bars and coffeehouses, places like Geddes Folk City, was writing up a storm, a storm to make a storm. She asked Peter Paul if he had heard Bob Dylan `s latest Blowin' In The Wind that was becoming a national anthem for the youth who wanted to change the world  and change it now. Peter Paul blushed, blushed crimson red or redder maybe. He had never heard of Bob Dylan. Next day though he was at Charlie's.

0061122416|2.0|This is a simple story that seems to have been written as a child's book. The story and characters are never well developed. I can't imagine how it has sold so many copies.
B004H83IG4|5.0|I found this movie extremely engaging, thrilling and mesmerising in so many ways.  I was in awe firstly with the script writers as they kept you on the edge of your seat as to where the situation  would take you from scene to scene. Secondly I was in awe of the actors Ryan Gosling, Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella who were so wonderful in their characterisations of these very complex individuals, mind you we are now talking about extremely masterful stars that have been so immensely credible in all genres that they have acted in the past, particularly Frank Langella.  Thirdly that this story was taken from hundreds of pages of transcrips from a real crime file and re-written so masterfully to capture one's immagination and leaving the viewer at the end of this movie with so many ideas that could have changed these sad peoples lives.  As mere humans we all get roads to travel and not all the times do we chose the best one, with a brighter ending to our life, in a way our life is shaped with the past that we have endured that makes us chose what is right in our minds and sometimes turns out so horribly wrong.<br /><br /> Basically I do agree with the previous people who previewed this movie and I don't want to repeat what they have already written but I must add that having  seen this DVD tonight, I could not wait to sit down and write about it while it still played on my mind and so I am definitely sure that you will feel the same way as this movie (or true story that it was) will haunt you and saddened you with the character that Ryan Gosling portrays.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for making this DVD available to stir our emotions and feelings and to be grateful that most of us are lucky enough to have simpler roads to travel on.<br />Sophia Bastas
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this book, made me cry, and laugh, up until the ending I would have given it a full five stars but the ending was done so quickly, it was more of a feeling of \\"bam it's done\\". Otherwise loved the tension between the hero/heroine which is what I look for in a book.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|It wasn't as good as the previous movies. It was lacking something... Maybe I'm just over the whole vampire thing.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|If you would like to imagine that the evil southerner confederate soldiers were vampires, then here is your movie.  Just another movie being made to divide the country like Machete and Django.  I know its just a movie, and it doens't offend me even though I live in the South.  I just know how many dumb sheeple we have living in this country that their thoughts are so easily swayed by any thing they see.  I'm just saying that a movie taken out of partial historical context twisted with obvious fiction, could lead some young person to subtle prejudice against Southerners in the future.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Thanks for the fast delivery and the great quality. I would do business again and would recommend friends or anyone for that matter to do business with you.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Simply put, it's been my favorite movie ever!! I'm not really a fan-boy, but judging by the success of this flick, you definitely don't have to be in order to enjoy this movie. Highly recommend!!!<br /><br />And people, for any movie that you've gained some sort of enjoyment from, please consider buying it at some point rather than pirating it. I know the economy is tight (blah blah blah), but that is how the big-wigs at the movie studios know what to make. If a movie flops at the theaters, and then again during its DVD release, it probably won't have a sequel...
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I had a hard time keeping an interest in the book. And felt he needed to discuss more about what he saw in heaven.
B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|I wish it was a better album. To me, this album lacks any of the pizazz or character of her other albums. It kinda seems like it was rushed to market.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona is just so good and she still has it!  One of her better CDs.  Very happy with the purchase!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Entertaining, thought provoking and very, very twisted.  This book challenges the dynamics of marriage, family, the media and the legal system. I loved the approach of varying the perspective of the storyteller, and the insights that brings to the reader.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone who enjoys reading because it hits on so many cylinders and levels. A great read!
B005P59ANS|5.0|Bought this as a gift item in June 2011 - it really is a good product and protects your phone superbly
B005NJU8PA|5.0|First this is one of the most beautifully published books I have, it is a wonder of modern publishing.  That aside, this information is non-stop revolutionary thinking, often like drinking from a firehose.  You will be referring to this massive tome over and over.  I have.  While this will teach you to become a VERY excellent cook in record time, it will also teach you literally dozens if not hundreds of other things as well from shooting hoops to survival knives to learning multiple languages.  It is foremost a brilliant treatise on how to become a world class learner and an expert in anything you choose in record time, enjoying all the benefits.  I love this book!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What's not to love about the walking dead? Lots of zombies, great plot, Daryl & Rick, and no more annoying Lori!
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This is my favorite version of this movie!  That little girl is adorable!  One for me & one for a gift!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Worth the wait to see.I like Sci-Fi alot and this is right up my alley.If you not seen yet DO,you won't regret it!!!!!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I really like this puzzle for toddlers.  My 3 year old grandson enjoys this game so much & is able to do it without any help. He loves the popping bubbles when he gets the puzzle right.  When I visit him, he asks for my Kindle first thing because he wants to play &#34;trains&#34;.  I recommend it for anyone with small children.
0307720950|5.0|Outstanding overview; written in a historical perspective and almost reads like literary non-fiction -- well that might be a stretch.<br /><br />Well worth reading and having on your bookshelf.  This book is intersting and perfect for the casual reader but oddly I think it would do well in a classroom setting also.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have read MANY fantasy books and this, by far, is my favorite!!!  As soon as I finished, I started over again.  It's mind blowing to me that this author could not get this book published b/4 now.  GREAT READ!!!!  Cannot wait for the next one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down! It is addicting! Never a dull moment! I could read it again and again!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Not the best book I've ever read. It was merely okay. Would not recommend it to my friends as a must read.
B007N31YFW|5.0|If the Monkees were reincarnated in Sweden (with actual musical talent), and decided they wanted to best the Beatle's \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" with a 21st century art flick/music video with a plot.....you might get something like \\"Sound of Noise\\". If Stomp and Blue Man Group stumbled onto onto a police thriller movie set in Stockholm....you might get something like \\"Sound of Noise\\". What fun! What great music! I wish I could see them in person....but this video (and the special features) is the next best thing.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Whoever had the presence of mind to create this collection - Thank You.  I didn't know how I was ever going to collect this music.<br /><br />Update: I had initially downloaded this to my ipod, then ordered cd's.  After receiving two cd's (one for a gift for someone else), I'm sad about the quality of the recordings.  Several of the pieces have background \\"hiss\\" that is very annoying.  I opened the gift cd to see if it was the same.  It isn't as bad but there are at least two badly hissing pieces.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I'm returning the worst one, sadly.
B009AVCAJ4|3.0|So the review is for the Blu-Ray. If your reading this you know this movie is a classic anime so I won't say much about that. It's still a great movie I'm happy to have on a Blu-Ray but.....and it's a big BUT for me. Only in 4x3 presentation which means not in widescreen so if you have a HDTV you'll be watching with vertical black bars on the sides. The visuals are improved over the DVD (I own that as well) but man I wish they could have updated to a true widescreen for 20 bucks I can't help but feel let down. Also no special features! So I rated this 3 stars not for the movie but the presentation. If you don't own this yet this is the best version out there but if you have it already on DVD only purchase if your a big fan.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|This cable was just what I was looking for. It works great, and is made of quality materials. I was very pleased with this purchase.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great set. Loved being able to show others, and they all agreed the show should have continued! The movie was also a good find. Decent delivery time and in excellent, brand new condition.
B008V59AFW|4.0|[revised]<br />I purchased the stand-alone 24-bit/48 kHz download elsewhere, but even after a coupon code that product was the same price as this box.  So, as long as the download coupon for the 24-bit version is included with this product, it seems like a good deal.  My comments will only be about the quality of the 2012 remastering, since I don't find any good information about that elsewhere.  I have owned the following versions of this album for points of comparison:<br /><br />1986 Geffin cassette - not worth mentioning, EXCEPT for one funny thing.  When I finally replaced my cassette with the CD version, the goal was to get rid of some muddiness and an almost tape-dragging sound, especially evident on \\"Red Rain.\\"  Guess what?  That subjective slight dragginess is in the mastering, not the cassette: it's a feature, not a bug.  It initially results from choices about a \\"watery\\" keyboard effect used on the album (we know it, we love it); combined with Tony Levin's frettless bass, which is just higher in pitch than I expect from a bass and so that sliding around hits the same register as the keyboards; the digital \\"kapow\\" effect at the beginning, which I take to be a slow-motion backwards drum-hit; and the overall layering of many instruments.  It's just an overall effect of lack of clarity , still present in the 24-bit 2012 mastering.  It probably never was a problem with my cassette, but it primed me to hear my tape as dragging as that watery keyboard and growly vocal styling continued throughout side A.  I mention it in case this is happening to you on your CD copy: don't expect it to change, because it's just the way \\"Red Rain\\" is.<br /><br />1980s CD - The 2012 engineer says the goal of the 2012 remaster was to get back to the original, but with slightly better equipment.  That's what has happened.  I definitely hear more detail than on the original CD.  Both the 2002 and 2012 versions sound generationally better than the original CD.  If you've ever had thechance to hear masterings from two different generations of source tapes (e.g., first-gen tapes compiled in the studio versus the production master they make by copying that studio master), you know what I'm talking about.  The mastering is ok: it's airy, good sound stage, and all the instruments are clear.  But that's all.  The bass is \\"there,\\" perfectly listenable, but there's no punch anywhere.  It's a bit flat.  The original CD has the full dynamic range, but is a little puny by comparison to the newer masterings.  This CD, btw, was the last time \\"In Your Eyes\\" would be at track 5 (aka side B, track 1).  The original CD and the 2012 CD should be similar in dynamics but with more heft on the new version as noted below.<br /><br />2002 remastered CD - It's good.  I tend to prefer it to the original CD.  In 2002, as now, one goal of typical remasterings was to make the music sound \\"better\\" meaning \\"louder\\" on lower-end systems owned by most people, like I-pods or all-in-one stereos or jam boxes.  This involves compressing the audio (reducing the dynamic range between loud and soft) so that all the instruments can all push the loudness envelope.  They also added more trebble and bass to the original master. The result on this album isn't over the top (many more recent remasters or new releases give me a head ache, they're so compressed and boomy).  The result makes the music a little darker and in fact subjectively narrows the sound stage slightly because the mid-ranges responsible for that airy breadth are lowered in service to more bass and trebble.  Tony Levin's bass is louder, but not more defined because the added umph is courtesy of EQ.  Honestly, though, if you have this CD, don't expect a significantly different experience from the 2012 version unless you're on a seriously good sound system.  Finally, the 2002 CD is much louder than either the 1986 or 2012 versions, for the reasons noted above.<br /><br />2012 remaster - Reduce the amount of compression fora more natural overall sound and allow significantly more definition, thanks to newer transfer equipment.  Note, I'm listening to the 24-bit version; however, in my experience bit depth is a much less important variable than mastering in determining the final sound.  Let's start with the fact that Tony Levin is the solo instrumentalist on this album.  The 2012 mastering gives him his full glory for the first time.  My attention is attracted to details, both in the bass and elsewhere, I have never noticed before in 25 years of listening to the album.  The bass solos are gripping.  Consider that a very foregrounded bass will have to be taken back a bit during compression to level out other instruments; now, though, the bass is unrestrained and no other instruments suffer as a result.  All the instruments have more weight than ever before, and are positioned very solidly in a nice wide sound stage.  My second listen, combined with more comparisons with the other two CDs, made me much more impressed with this new mastering.  Dynamic range is critical if you have a really good stereo (e.g., an integrated amp and the rest, an \\"audiophile\\" system).  I don't know if it's as audible on lower-end systems, which really do benefit from the artificial punch of EQ and compression.  Side-by-side, you can hear that the 2002 master has been artificially punched up.  The 2012 master is more pleasant and involving.  For example, the very quiet \\"don't give up\\" chant at the end of that track, which was boosted on the 2002 disc, here becomes very quiet yet perfectly clear underneath the front-and-center, decisive bass groove.  But it's only in a side-by-side comparison that these differences stick out.  The 2002 choices weren't bad ones.<br /><br />So, if you have a very good system, you may here significant enhancements in the new remaster.  If you have an average or economy sound system, or if you're not positively glued to your speakers/headphones listening to every nuance, the fact is that this album was done pretty well in both its earlier incarnations already.  Although I was afraid I was being ripped off when I hit the button, I'm actually quite glad of the purchase.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not at all what i was expecting..in a very good way! Very intelligently written. So many twists and turns, i Couldnt put it down!
0812974786|5.0|This was one of the most powerfully moving (or enlightening)books I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book and the message it sent; it really does not matter what faith you follow, so long as it is meaningful to you. It's also about finding your own path and following what you believe in. Siddhartha was beautifully written (that may not be entirely credited to the author, but the translator), filled with eloquent words. This is a real masterpiece of writing, very nearly a perfect book. It evoked so much emotion from me, admiration, anger, disgust, and contentment, among so many others. There was only one slow spot, in the beginning and in the middle, I absolutely hated the main character but he did redeem himself.<br /><br />All in all, I absolutely loved this book and I believe that everyone needs to read this boo some time in their life
B0010SKSTO|4.0|I've read several books on human behavior, body language, and sociology, and i have to say this was a great book. Very informative with enough anecdotes to keep you totally interested
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I don't read many books over more than once, but I have read this book 4 times and will read it again in the future.<br />Love the way the characters talk and the story.<br />-If you like this book check out \\"Tales from Watership Down\\" as well.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp showing his experience, cunning, and determination not seen to this degree in previous books.  Strongly recommend this book.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This headset here is by far the best headset i have ever owned in my life. I have owned the x11's, the x31's and the dpx21's. Some people say they are overpriced, which is true but you get what you pay for. Here is some cons and pros about this headset.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Booming bass<br />Great highs and Mids<br />No crackles or pops<br />Good Battery life<br />Easy to charge<br />Can use at school to listen to music with bluetooth.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Pricy<br />Short range, barely can make it 25 feet and it looses connection<br />Cant hook up to my pc.<br /><br />These are way better than the 3 other turtle beaches i have had. If you got the moolah to afford these then go for it. Some ppl say its not 7.1. Honestly I dont hear a diffrence between 7.1 and 5.1. I think its just preference.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Lots of fun.... I wish there was a way you can log in with a password so it can be accessed on any device.

0525958002|2.0|At 40 yrs. old I am still a huge fan of 80's hair bands and their music, including Duran Duran.  In fact, I just saw them in concert twice over the last year during their most recent tour and their performance was awesome!  They're still on top of their game!  Anyway, aside from their music, I really didn't know anything else about the band, so I was thrilled to hear that John had released a memoir.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed.  I found the book to be very boring and quite bland, and not because John didn't \\"throw anyone under the bus\\" or invade peoples' privacy, but because he presented himself as completely flat and one-dimensional...never once throughout the entire book did he exude any passion, depth of character, emotion, etc. about himself, his life, or the influential people who helped shape his existance.  I mean, how does one describe his rise to stardom, his mind-blowing rock-star career, his closest confidants, his bandmates, his daughter, his wife, his parents, etc., completely devoid of emotion and without any in-depth explanation???  Literally the reader doesn't know what any of this is like for John, only just that it existed in a chronological fashion.<br /><br />Sadly, the book is completely unengaging and doesn't read like a memoir at all, but more like a dry, factual, unbiased non-fiction book that one would use for a research project.  In my opinion, the most interesting parts were the ones that talked about his (as well as Duran Duran's) musical inspirations and how they personally collaborated with many of them.<br /><br />Furthermore, I was actually kind of appalled at the way he ended the book, paying tribute to all of the other members in the band, except for Andy.  This sounds silly, but reading that line felt like a sucker-punch...especially when throughout the book, John continuously mentioned how everyone in the band always considered themselves as equal partners (even splitting income 5 ways), since it was the combined efforts of ALL of them that contributed to the band's incredible success.  He also doesn't mention why Andy decided to leave the band in the mid-2000's, simply that he did.  Unless this man has done something absolutely unforgivable to John and/or his loved ones, I thought the lack of acknowledgment was a pretty class-less move.  After all, John and the band most likely wouldn't be where they are today, if it wasn't for the combined talents of each and every one of them.<br /><br />I have since moved on to Andy's book to see if I can satisfy my curiosity there...<br /><br />However, I will continue to enjoy Duran Duran's music everytime they tour ;o) !

1934030597|5.0|Well written, easy to follow, and even funny.  Be warned, this is not for the guy who can't even change his tire because it's way more advanced than that.  It already saved me money in preventative maintenance tips, and if I'd owned it a year ago it would have saved me way WAY more than it costs when I allowed my chain to stretch to far and ruin my rear sprocket.  Every serious mountain biker should own this book.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|We love Toy Story and Toy Story 3.  For some reason we had not seen this one yet.  We watched this while at Disney World in Orlando and LOVED it!  It was by far my favorite of the 3.  Ham is hilarious and the new characters are great!

B00A2XU9IS|5.0|I'm so glad I purchased this app for my kids. I wanted a fun advent calendar and this one is perfect.<br /><br />I installed it on my phone and my Fire, so both of my children could have their own and it looks great on both devices. Each day has a little rhyme and then a small activity to complete. The activities are simple enough that my 3 year old doesn't get frustrated, but interesting enough that my 6 year old doesn't get bored. Best of all, they won't let you accidentally (or impatiently!) open days ahead of time. Each one &rdquo;unlocks&rdquo; on that day.<br /><br />All in all, a great app, especially for .99!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Nice game with many levels to choose from and the game sounds are not bad.  Would be good for all ages.
B0099092QU|4.0|Do yourself a favor Slash fans. If you buy it from Amazon.co.uk it only costs £37 including shipping which is about $55 sooo much cheaper than the U.S site!! I have no idea why.<br />My husband is going to be super excited as this is not easy to get hold of over here. He already loved the Apocalyptic Love album and the live show in NY, so this is just going to enhance the whole experience.<br />Just thought I should pass this money saving tip on. Enjoy!

B009LRE040|5.0|Christopher Nolan really did it with the Batman trilogy. I haven't seen any movies that were as good as these, and even the last of the three movies was strong compared to many other third movies. The casting was up to par with the movie's predecessor, with Tom Hardy playing &#34;Bane&#34;, the masked mercenary. The emotion of this film was probably more striking than that of the last one simply because it's a different side of Bruce Wayne that we've never seen. Even though the Joker's (Heath Ledger) mind games were enough to dazzle audiences, Bane's brutality and mental prowess prove to be more than a match for the Joker's psychotic &#34;plan&#34;. This film has that re-watchability factor that allows viewers to enjoy it multiple times without fail, and proves that the more you watch it, the more you will come to appreciate how Nolan has rejuvenated Batman since Tim Burton.
B005PK553C|4.0|I really enjoyed this series, it was a great mix of suspense, and story telling.<br />I'm not a gore fan, and there was a little of this, that's the only reason it didn't get 5 stars.

B005OCHOZS|4.0|UPDATE: 12/11/12  While I still love this book...I've downgraded it to 4 stars instead of 5 after finishing....The Reason...I have the kindle edition and after reading 76% of the Kindle edition...the book ends! The last 24% of the Kindle edition is a running bibliography, a somewhat haphazard footnote list, and an index to the recipes...which are already given within the text.  Overall this is still a great book but the way the kindle edition is presented can be improved.<br /><br />I am in the middle of the book right now but this is a 5 star...no 6 star book. Presented in everyday language with great easy recipes mixed in. Makes a meat eater want to try becoming a vegan!.  I always liked listening to Scott Jurek talk....great now that I get to spend so much time with his book, listening to all his inner thoughts.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Favorite action heros, especially Chuck Norris. Enough action and and comedy that makes for a very entertaining 2 hours of watching.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod could sing nursery ditties and make them sound wonderful.  I have many Christmas albums but he's my all time favorite!
B005K17RU0|5.0|What more can you ask for?  This app gives you reliable weather information, literally at your fingertips.  Easily get the weather from any location and conveniently saves your last location.  Highly recommended.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Great CD whether you enjoy disco, a terrific artist or simply enfoy Donna Summer!  You will thoroughly enjoy it and probably find yourself &#34;dancing to the music!&#34;
B001706I5I|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my granddaughters so that they would have something to watch when they come to visit their grandfather.
B0019C6ETE|5.0|Interesting, fast moving intrigue makes this book fun to read.  Well written and exciting because it is based on a true story.
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosby's White Christmas has to be the best music around for the Christmas season and if you have the CD in your Christmas music selection, you need to get it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Because say you have to go to work  and you sleep in a lot and you want to set alarm that's your app.

0786962984|5.0|Fun for the whole family. The instructions seems complicated but once you play it a few times it is easy to figure out. My 6 year old loves playing it and now considers herself a dungeon master.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Engaging and entertaining! I loved being able to pick it up and play for 2 minutes or 2 hours! Save anytime!
0061124958|5.0|My God Daughter is only 4 and learning to read. This book may be a bit advanced for her, but I bought it so her parents can read it to her, giving them quality time with her. Families should do more of this!
B00466HN72|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie along with my two years old, it has a catching tune to it, recommend to have it in your collection for long trips in the car to keep the peace ;)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is my favorite book by far. It was like I was watching a movie rather than reading a book. It has fought me so many lessons and helped me find myself in a way nothing else could. It has spoken to me like no other book has. I highly recommend this book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|We all love this game. Love how they used the Star Wars characters. My son loves the light sabers. Works well on my phone and kindle.
0312567448|4.0|I'll be honest, I got this book as a result of the first \\"Sex and the City\\" movie.  Although the Love Letters of Great Men that Big read to Carrie was a ficticious book, the idea of a book containing a collection of love letters from great men in our history was a very romantic concept.  So I searched on Amazon and found this book.  There's nothing surprising about the book.  It is what it states to be.  It's a nice cute book to my bookshelf of cute book of paperbacks. :)
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like this game. There are different tasks to complete and different things to get. I like building the cars. It has become very addictive.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Big fan of P!nk.  Got this album only really liking 2 songs on it.  Most of the songs have grown on me now.  Many different styles of music, but all with the P!nk flair.<br /><br />Love the music and the digital book was a nice personal touch.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was very enjoyable reading. It was suspenseful.  You never knew what was going to happen next.  Although the first book did not have a very good ending, each book left you wondering what was going to happen in the next.  It had a very good ending!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is really fun. It also occupies you. I thought it would be dumb but its really cool. I LIKE.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It was a great app. And I enjoy every minute of it. I will recommend it to all my friends and famiy.
0374275637|5.0|The first half is better than the second, but it's all worth reading. It reads like a field guide to modern psychology.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Fascinating journal of both inner and outer journeys of a young woman who feels lost on many levels but who finds herself while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  It was an enormous challenge for her, and a grueling hike for anyone, let alone a beginner.  It's a wonderful story of inner strength, determination, and the growth that perserverance in the face of seemingly unsurmountable odds can bring.  Loved it!
0062202081|1.0|i had to buy this for a gift for a birthday present, otherwise i wouldn't pay for a book about this guys life,
B008JF8O9M|5.0|I use this app on my Fire, printing over WIFI to a Canon printer connected to a Mac in another part of the house. Works very well. I printed documents and web pages using PrintBot.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to use, great radar feature, I use this app daily and it works very well. I love it!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a movie to watch more than once!  Filled with great actors, memorable lines and well-drawn characters.  While it may be geared to an older audience, it is still a joy.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I'm basically a meat and potatoes southern guy.  Explaining how to fool people into eating liver is not my cup of tea. I don't eat organs - never have and never will.  Also the survival training chapter seemed a bit of a stretch for a cook book.  His use of foul language didn't bother me, but may put off others.  I have very many cook books, but this will not be a favorite.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Nothing bad to say about this movie, except that I'd hoped they would do the entire story.  Granted that would make for a fairly long film but having the whole story together would be worth it.<br /><br />See this one!
B005KELW26|5.0|This case is lightweight, thin and fits my Kindle Fire perfectly! It has a black velvet inside with purple threading which is beautiful! Love it!!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was one of the best games I have ever played! Soundtrack and graphics were very impressive and I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline. Hoping to see more games of this quality soon. This is a rare find!
B00000DOYR|5.0|A classic CD in terrific condition at a fair price. What else could one ask for? Not for the faint of heart.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great price for all 8 movies! Received the movies in excellent condition. Harry Potter fan a must have! Love them. Makes a great stocking stuffer.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Great duo and a great collection.  Thanks Amazon for an amazing selection of mp3 downloads.  The Cloud drive makes our collection a snap to hear and protect.
B005SZAEYO|1.0|I could barely make it through the first episode. Not scary and I didn't care about the characters or what happened.  More of a freaky show like Twin Peaks than a scary show.  Also too much man behind and in case you are wondering I am a woman.  It doesn't make the show better, its like its just there to try and be racy.  Boring not racy, 15 other shows have done it before you.  Not to mention the plot was ridiculous and too much soap opera type drama.  The wife being upset about an affair, him trying to get her to forgive him, blah blah blah.  I really wanted to like this since I am a scary movie super fan, but alas this just wasn't the show for me.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Like many others, I absolutely love the NCIS program.  The great thing about it is the interactions between the primary characters, and how as each season progresses the characters and their interactions deepen and evolve.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I'm pathetic but enjoy the challenge. I will need to practice many more hours to play real piano music -the end
1469984202|5.0|I don't ever write reviews. Ever. If you think this is my first review, well you're right.<br /><br />I just finished the series last night.<br /><br />I wanted to wait until the very end to give this series a fair and honest review. However, upon finishing the last page of this series of books, I realized all too late that I had completely wasted my time...because these books are brilliantly fantastic starting from the very first chapter!<br /><br />\\"What's so great about these books,\\" you ask?<br /><br />\\"Stop asking stupid questions and go read them,\\" I answer...politely.<br /><br />However, if you INSIST on knowing, some of my favorite aspects of this scifipentasterpiece (scifi + penta + masterpiece) were it's writing style, strikingly accurate ways of portraying the minds and moods of people put in the situations and the creativity and scope of the story.<br /><br />How good were they? They were so good that colleagues at work were legitimately convinced I was high because my eyes were ridiculously bloodshot, as I had only squeezed in three hours of sleep due to these accursed and beautiful works. The last time this happened was when I read Lord of the Rings in 11th grade. Just like how I was transported to Middle Earth every time I read LOTR, every time I opened these pages I was in the silo myself.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this book has made some of the other novels I've read recently feel like they were a huge waste of time. Thanks a lot Mr. Howey.<br /><br />Lovingly and sincerely,<br /><br />Me, your dedicated new fan.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a period soap opera type series but with good actors.  There are so many different stories going on, I couldn't stop watching once I started.
B005LJETYI|4.0|Good pitch, good ending, short & cool story. Simple writing, quite a lot of emotion, the &#34;OH LOOK WE HAVE MECHA&#34; side of the story is not overwhelming.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I bought this for my little sister who just loves Big Bang Theory. It arrived pretty fast and the package was perfect with the exception of a little dent on the top right corner.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Absolutely could not put this book down. If you're on the fence, just go for it. You won't regret buying this.
B001FEAA3C|4.0|Even though this is the Mp3 version of that classic concert or concerts,you can still feel the energy coming off David Bryne.Because lets face it,the  Talking Heads  are nothing without David that was showed in the one song the Tom Tom Club played in the album, it was lifeless.But when David came out with the big suit,things picked up again.But David is not as good without Frantz,Weymouth,or Harrison.The evidence shows in his solo career which is nothing compared to his TH days.But this album is a must have for anyone with a good ear and sense of life.This is kinda like a studio version, by that i mean the crowd noise is mostly blocked out,his supporting singers arent as audible,and you can hear Davids voice twice,one in echo and the other one on stage.But STOP Making Sense provided rythyms to songs that were better than the studio version by fa,for example ,Burning Down the House,Take me to the River,and Girlfriend is Better.All in all,this is a MUST HAVE FOR ANY MUSIC FAN!
044654759X|3.0|Is it just me, or is this book extremely similar to the film 'Sleeping with the Enemy'?<br /><br />As a big Sparks fan, I purchased this book on pre-order. When I read it, I enjoyed it, even if the style is slightly unusual for Sparks. Yet, I could not shake the niggling reeling of deja-vu.<br /><br />This week there was a re-run of Sleeping with the Enemy, with Julia Roberts. And it hit me then...the great similarities right down to abusive husband wanting things done in a certain way.<br /><br />I first saw this film twenty years ago, a long time before Sparks wrote this...<br />Funny...
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So shittily written. The sex scenes are obviously the most carefully constructed part of the piece. There is no actual ending, it just ends. Waste of time and money.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|ORDERED AS STOCKING STUFFER FOR MY SON. HE HAS ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE, BUT WANTED A ENGLISH DUBBED VERSION. I JUST KNOW HES GOING TO LOVE IT...
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|The most talented singer songwriter to come out of American Idol.  His humility and good manners should carry him far.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I hate to see the series end! I read all four books and saw all five movies! I never thught I would like vampires.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I downloaded this app and loved it the graphics are very good. The story line was decent, the game made you think, but wasn't so hard that you couldn't figure it out, all in all it was a great app, I highly recommend it.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  I was a big fan of Norah's work on Danger Mouse's &#34;Rome&#34; album, and this has a similar feel.  Dark yet beautiful.<br />What amazes me about Norah Jones is her ability to be flexible, change, experiment while keeping her natural beauty.  Her voice is pitch perfect and her fans will love listening to her.<br /><br />Warning: this is not a jazz cd.  this is a darker, more emotional record.  but perhaps one of her best to date.
B009MF56GC|3.0|This movie stretches &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; credibility way too far. There were battle scenes where our heroes are about to be eliminated by the armies of bad guys, when all of a sudden a hero who had been quickly introduced earlier comes form out of the blue to save the day. The heroes always outrun the machine gun bullets, while the bad guys die like lemmings. A high point of the film are the inside jokes, and fun the stars poke at each other. The film is enjoyable to watch, but you have to disregard logic too often.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|This movie really got to me. It's my favorite leonardo movie and everyone needs to see it. Leonardo is a cop sent to search the island for a missing girl who seemingly escaped her cell without opening the door. From there he questions some o te most violent inmates bout her disappearance. But noone knows anything. From there the plot changes to flashbacks of his life this movie is very good and keeps u on ur toes one to watch many times to really capture what's going on in the island.
B008518MOW|4.0|The high point for me in this film is Josh Brolin's amazing impression of Tommy Lee jones as a young man. The computer generated effect are amazing -- from alien effects to a terrific sequence where New York city goes back in time to prehistoric eras and back to the early 70s -- all in an instant. The effects are capped off by a shuttle launch sequence that that was equal to, and possibly surpassed &#34;Apollo 13.&#34; The dialog in places gets a little touchy-feely, and seems to go on for a bit too long in spots. Men in Black fans will not be disappointed in this one.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|perfect box set, i'm a fan of the movies but even if i were not the box set the collection is awesome, even friend who see this product told me how cool it is.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Little bit hard to understand the configuration , but sound experience very good with excellent quality and long life battery
B0015AARJI|1.0|The controller itself is very well-designed, but you might want to buy new. I bought mine used, and have had to take it apart multiple times trying to get the R1 and R2 triggers working properly. R1 was stuck down, which made it totally useless. R2 still doesn't work correctly, there is a spring that keeps the proper resistance on it, but that piece is defective on mine so it has a \\"hair trigger.\\" If you so much as tap it, you're dropping accidental grenades on Call of Duty.    These controllers also have an issue with a pad inside that wears down over time, causing them to malfunction and generate random button presses. It can be fixed with a little electrical tape, but you have to know what you're doing.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am hooked on this game, which says a lot because I normally don't have the attention span for games. The music gets to be a bit annoying, but adjusting the volume fixes that. My son always wants to watch me &#34;run from the monkeys&#34; and I think he'll have the game figured out before long.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Are there 2 versions out by Lego?  A regular size and this very, very small one--it seems ridicules to pay that kind of money for this mini version.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I did love the story that Fifty Shades of Grey presented.  Christian is a wildly successful man of business whose past has left him damaged and because of this he endulges in a BDSM lifestyle where he is a dominant.  Anastasia is a very intelligent but naive young woman who has never been interested in a man until Christian Grey.  She willingly goes into his lifestyle as his submissive so she can be with him.<br />The love story itself was wonderful.  It tugged at my heart and I found myself truly wanting them to be together.  The emotion was there also and I found myself smiling when they were happy and heartbroken when they weren't.  Of course, I will say this.  Unlike Twilight, this book is not for underage people.  Still, it is a love story.<br />The only problem I had with the book is that it had some places that dragged.  Still, I do believe you should give this book a try.  It is a wonderful love story but it also the story of a man who is trying to pull himself from the darkness but doesn't know how.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|If you're used to facebook version<br />it's just OK...better than NOT being<br />able to play.<br />it's a variety anyway. enjoy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked the trilogy so much that I read it twice!  It is a fast read and holds your interest from beginning to end.
0525953728|5.0|Great read on learning the inner workings of the military and all of the red tape they have to go through to defend our freedom. very well written.
1401301010|5.0|Great book. It is hard to believe some of the stories in this book are true. Anthony Kiedis has lived a very interesting life. This book was hard to put down.
0385512058|5.0|This book is an easy read and insightful to how to properly network and make the most out of connections with people.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I opted to purchase a Macally G-S350SUA that doesn't have Firewire800...lower price, plus I could experiment on my firewire camera connecting to my MacBook Pro that has FW800. Worked like a charm to connect hard drive or camera. Good fit in available port where other adapters I read about were too large.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I loved this movie. It's one of those that I can watch over and over again without getting tired of. The execution and plot seems very well thought out and I love the humor.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|My childhood favorite book comes alive with the wonderful interpretation Anne Hathaway gives it.  I'm re-enchanted!<br />It is like having a bedtime story read to you in real time.  Love it.

These are, all four, great enjoyable movies.  I would rate them in this order: Last Crusade, Raiders, Crystal Skull/Temple of Doom (a tie).  Unlike &#34;reviewers&#34; who dislike the fourth movie, I am happy to have all the movies in one place.  And the price, $39.99, is unbeatable.  I'm a lazy reviewer.  If you want the detailed, technical review, go to xxx-xxx.xxx.  (Amazon doesn't allow external urls.  Suffice it to say, the name of the media format,  BLU-RAY, is the name of the site.)<br /><br />The packaging isn't the best.  I would rate it 3 out of five stars.  If you are careful, you shouldn't have any problems.  I would suggest getting a good 5 disc holder and putting the movies in there.  Do a search here on Amazon for EMPTY BLU-RAY CASES.  You should find something you like.<br /><br />Overall: This is the best version of these movies currently available.  At a reasonable price, you shouldn't be disappointed with this set.hould find something you like.<br /><br />Overall: This is the best version of these movies currently available.

B009AMALGM|2.0|Let me start by saying I am a fan of the first three Paranormal Activity movies, especially part three. I was excited to sit down and watch part four but soon after I was bored and waiting an waiting an waiting.....the activity is at an all time low this go round and takes so long to get to,than once you get there its not all that great.<br /><br />There we're things in the film I didn't understand mainly about Hunter and the ending......I guess the Hunter issue would be considered a plot hole and the ending would be considered.....stupid. Now that I think about it the daughter was a blonde so that could be why the events at the end played out as they did! (Note: I have nothing against blondes)<br /><br />For me \\"[[ASIN:B006P0FD4W Paranormal Activity 3]]\\" was the best in the series and had the most an best activity of the bunch in my opinion. It feels like they went from flying high with PA3 to an engine stale resulting in a fiery crash an burn which is PA4.....for me it was that bad. The only thing I liked in the whole film was the use of the Xbox360 Kinect, other than that there was nothing about \\"Paranormal Activity 4\\" I liked.<br /><br />Hands down the biggest disappointment in the whole Paranormal Activity series.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|You want to be focused on your video recording and not fiddling with getting this piece of junk to balance.
B001CQONKY|5.0|I would buy this in a new york min.<br /><br />as always well acted plot was on the edge and left you wanting more
B00062PN6I|3.0|I did need an economical set that could be used in an emergency and this product fits the description. Would I use them on a regular basis...no. They will however keep you going until a better set can be obtained. Just have to put up with a little muddiness, that's all.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|My wife and I love the song about losing your girlfriend. Look forward to hearing the rest. Train has always been on of our favorite bands.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great read, Chris Kyle tells it like it is, not like the bunch of crap you usually see on TV.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Well its been a few weeks and I love this thing. Still have not beat the epic. I beat the regular after like 5 hours. it was fun. I stillplay with both of them, but the Epic gets more play time, specially becauseof the difficulty. This is awesome for anyone who works a desk job, that needs to release some stress and focus on something else besides work, this will make you focus intently on it, Great fun for all ages,
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app. play every night before bed. nice and simple format. I have only played random deal. could not be better.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|A very funny movie. A litle raunchy which I enjoy honestly. I would definatley say its an improvment from the last 21 jump street movie. Definatley a laugh out loud comedy
B000VBJEEG|3.0|But maybe too silly for those much older than that.. I remember that it had the usual high &#34;Pixar&#34; level of detail and quality of animation but don't think most people would enjoy repeated viewings.
1439196834|5.0|This product lists every play Barney has ever named (and some he hasn't) and describes them the exact way he does. This product is well worthit if you enjoy the humour in the show, and appreciate the novelty value.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy this game. My only complaint would be in regards to an in-app purchase. I paid for acorns and coins and my totals have yet to reflect such.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Not much into the HALO world up to now....but this live action movie...was awesome. Wasn't prepared for it. Great story!!
B004DNWPY4|5.0|In general: Married, but just once and still married, drive old Cadillac OR F150 pickup, live BELOW their means, own their own local business, and don't flaunt it.<br /><br />This is how real millionaires live, and how they got that way.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I haven't read for pleasure in quite some time, and this was the book I decided to do it with.  I saw the first season on HBO first, and that is why I decided to read the book too.  Just like any book when compared to the movie/TV it is nice to see many of the holes left in the movie being filled in by the book.  I had a hard time with the many new titles and terms brought up in the book, but imagine that is normal with this type of genre.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Add this to 'the Millionaire Next Door' and you have a couple of good books on the philosophy of financial success.<br /><br />The basics are (1) live below your means, (2) education is expensive, but not having it costs much more, (3) make your investments work for you, (4) if it makes money it is an investment, if not, it is an expense in the real world. (no matter what the tax man or accountant tells you).<br /><br />It is NOT a 'how to' book, but read it, learn the philosophy about money and move on.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There's a lot going on within this site.  I even heard on the news this morning &#34;wanted&#34; pictures are being posted and assisting local law enforcement in catching bad guys!  This is a fun site for recipes, style, crafts, and just all kinds of things.  Love, love, love it!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|What happens when you give the guy who brought you Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Firefly $200 million to make a movie? Pure magic.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The series is just great, and this set was very reasonably priced.  The fun is getting it in a couple of days if you are Prime!!!!  (There's a lot to be said for instant gratification!)  Good buy!
B005S9EJ14|3.0|The cast is great and I love stories that take place in India, but it wasn't quite as amusing as I expected.  I'll still  keep it in my collection and probably watch it again.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a terrific app, and I use it nightly.  (There is a paid version of this app, but this one is free and I find absolutely nothing wrong with it.)  There are multiple soothing sounds offered, and while I have preferences of course, the sounds are beautifully done and very realistic.  I do not notice breaks or undue pauses in the loop, and I am not aware of any abnormal sounds or interference.  This app has the capability of of allowing more than one sound to be played at a time, and it is great to mix them.  It has a timer, an alarm, a way to save your favorites, and it couldn't be better!  And it's free!!!
0547884591|5.0|This book is incredible - it is also very high level.  I honestly think the 1 and 2 star reviewers here \\"just don't get it\\".  It's not about cooking - heck, it's barely even about the various topics that permeate the book (though you can pick up some amazing skills throughout).  This book is about very sophisticated learning methodologies.  It is somewhat hard to explain, but here is my best go of it:<br /><br />The greatest value in this piece is not to try and learn WHAT Tim is teaching in this book - try to understand HOW Tim learned these skills himself.  He even says in the subtitle of his book \\"The simple guide to...LEARNING ANYTHING\\".  It truly is a brilliant examination of how to acquire knowledge and skills rapidly.<br /><br />Now, beyond the high level stuff, there is also some REALLY fun skills and experiments in the book.  Skin a deer, make fire-by-friction, etc.<br /><br />All I can say is: read this book.  Delight in the details, take in the bigger concepts, and learn some cool stuff. Do it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|As a mom of three, I watch alot of kids movies. Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is one that I don't mind watching again and again. I love the colorful scenes and the fun songs. My kids (5 and 3) loved it in the movie theater and were just as excited to watch it a second time when I got the dvd in the mail. We sing &#34;Let It Grow&#34; all the time. :)

B005NJU8PA|3.0|I never bought any of Tim's books before but I had read his blog once in a while and appreciate his ability to write captivating stories.<br /><br />From this book you will be introduced to basic cooking skills and recipes that should have you motivated to cook. The cooking section of this book gets the job down by creating a reference guide to world tastes that do not require 40 different herbs and spices makes cooking more accessible.<br /><br />In his usual fashion he goes after cutting time and money out as a barrier to entry for new stay at home chefs. He does a good job at that but it is also where he loses me.<br /><br />He packed in way too much off-topic chapters into this one book. The first two sections, Meta-Learning and Domestic, compliment each other well but once I got to Wild I felt like I was in a completely different book and I was getting tired of reading the book. I felt the last two sections, Wild and Professional, could have been a supplementary book or an add-on for later.<br /><br />In all fairness the reader does not have to read the last two sections to get value from this book and can go back to reference the last two chapters when they are ready to dive into the world of Ferriss, whose style fits well into the blog but gets a bit tired in a book, after spending some time away.<br /><br />Good reference book for basics and I am glad to have read it even though it displays poorly on the kindle ink readers because it is formatted with color guides and tables that are only valuable on a tablet.
1454901276|4.0|This is a murder mystery set on an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. Fin Macleod, a policeman just returning to work after the tragic death of his son, is sent back to his isolated home town, a place he feels he has escaped, to help investigate a brutal murder that seems to mirror the one he had been investigating in Edinburgh. The investigation forces him to meet with former friends and lovers and to remember and confront a great many things about his former home and events there that he would have preferred to leave to the past. This is a well written novel about the regrets and joys of trying to go home again. Anyone of a certain age will sympathize with the main character as he examines the regrets and mistakes of his life, as well as the ways, both fair and unfair, that he is seen by others. My only problem with the book is that it seemed to carry with it a deep and unrelenting fog of sadness. Don't read this book on a dreary day; read it on a sunny day in summer so that you can walk outside and let the gloom blow away on the breeze.
B0094AYT36|2.0|As an experience vinyl lover, I had high expectations on this one... I've heard the album before, but since it was THAT good, I just HAD to get myself a vinyl copy. The price was rather high. If most vinyls even gatefolds are around 18 to 25$, this particular one was well over the 33+ shipping.    It turned out that despite the vinyl was sealed, inside the disc was put loose without a soft polytheen sleeve. The vinyl disc had multiple severe scratches and stains...but what shocked me the most was the quality of sound! It was horrible!!! Loud annoying clicks and bumps, no lows on the bass, no depth, just the middles... WTF IS THIS S***????

1423140605|5.0|My daughters and I love this series.  It's well written and the plot is engaging.  I was worried that because the author had reached the end of his Percy Jackson series, he realized he needed a quick (meaning low quality) replacement to keep readers buying his books.  I am more than pleased; I don't think the writing has fallen off at all and in fact, I think this series is actually better than the Percy Jackson series.  It's a great series that features strong characters, both boys and girls.  I highly recommend it.
B007HLIUN4|5.0|There are numerous excellent reviews of this book in leading magazines like the New York Times and the New York Review of Books, which is a testament to the calibre of this book and also the reason why I won't try to cover ground that is already well-covered by other reviewers. Iwill just say that there are three reasons why you should read this book.<br /><br />1. It offers a thought-provoking thesis about why some countries are poor and have remained poor for many decades (but also why some countries, initially the UK, then Western Europe and the US, and more recently Japan, Korea and some others in Asia, have been able to find a path to sustained 'prosperity'). In short, Acemoglu and Robinson argue that political and economic institutions are what matter (but not, eg, culture or geography).<br /><br />2. Along the way, the book provides fascinating vignettes from throughout history (from ancient Rome to the great plague in Europe to the Mayas to the English revolution to the Kingdom of Kongo) that are well worth reading even if you are not always convinced about the broader thesis.<br /><br />3. Everybody else is reading it, and you don't want to caught out in the dinner party conversations do you?!
0307454541|4.0|The crime committed is extremely disgusting and so is the criminal, and it is hard to think things so gruesome happen at all. I do not think that, though sexual assault is common, one so gruesome is even remotely part of human nature.<br /><br />However, other than that it is a good book. Didn't like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo getting raped, but it *is\\" the reality that children, particularly girls, in care do get raped and abused sexually; so it is better to have the reality out in the open to discuss rather than brush it under the carpet. The author uses the initial injustices done to Slandeer as a justification for later infringement or law for personal gain.<br /><br />The character formation of the girl is good, and Bomkwist is weaker, but okay; but the other characters are bland.<br /><br />Contrary to some of the readers here I really liked the first part of the book, the relationship with Dragan and Salander's work at his company etc. I thought this part was crucial to the rapid development of Salander's character.<br /><br />I managed to guess at the very chapter introducing Vangar's mission and the suspects who the culprit would be.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I got the shipment long before the due date and brand new as well. A great series in a nice case. Exactly, if not better than what I had expected.
0345536886|4.0|While this is not really a mystery per se (it has no murder or any other crime in it), it is definitely engaging legal drama in the civil litigation arena.  What struck me most and made it a very entertaining read is the humour - the loveable (almost Dickensian) character Wally, the ambulance chasing pet dog AC, and the loud secretary Rochelle, paired with an occasional secondary character like DeeAnna, makes a colourful ensemble of characters that litters the pages with hilarious situations and laugh out loud humour.  The plot and the character casting is superb, but the narrative and the prose is what I call \\"utilitarian.\\" I guess this is not supposed to be literary fiction.  John Grisham pulls of a nice, very satisfying ending in this one.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|&#34;Chef&#34; is an excellent guide to good cooking.  All aspects of this science are explored, everything from setting a table to garnishing food for a a fancy fest.  His instructions on prepping for a four-person dinner are invaluable.  Just in case you don't find his approach interesting, his language should truly pepper you with surprises.<br /><br />Bruce Goyette<br />Townsend, Mass.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is so hilarious...<br />Crashing your character is sometimes more enjoyable than completing the level.<br />Keep making more games!
B004AHNIGM|4.0|Wha? What happened to Gregg Allman's voice?<br /><br />That was my first thought when I heard Low Country Blues.  Then, I read the reviews here and realized that what happened was the style T-Bone Burnett used to record it, the T-Bone Burnett signature style. My pal told me it had to do with taking out the midrange, and now I think that's it.  So, if you're looking to hear vintage Gregg Allman, go elsewhere.  There is definitely some element of richness amputated out of his voice on this recording. He sounds flat, kinda like an old man.<br /><br />That said, the collection is masterful and rich in its own right.  All but one of the tunes are covers of mostly old blues.  One of my favorites is the plaintive \\"Please Accept My Love,\\" but it's right up there with \\"Floating Bridge\\" and \\"Just Another Rider.\\"  I cringe and get a little pissed off when I hear the \\"gun in your face\\" line in \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\" which kind of ruins it for me, but it's a classic and it is what it is.<br /><br />Frankly, for years, to me, The Allman Brothers were: 1. the band that Duane Allman was in, 2. the Eat a Peach Album, and Gregg was Duane's little brother who married Cher.  In 1973, my Floridian boyfriend, a Duane Allman fan, asked me to take his picture in his tie-dyed tank top in front of \\"Number One Duane\\" Avenue in a nearby city in Northern California. I still have that picture of his hippy-haired face smiling out from under the name of his guitar hero.  He had great memories of seeing the Allman Brothers many times when they were doing countless free concerts throughout the South, around 1970.  I imagine I'd seen them at the Fillmore West, but as they say, if you can remember the sixties and early seventies, you probably weren't THERE.<br /><br />So, I'm a born-again fan. I'm going through the Allman oeuvre, and I realize now that it was Gregg's voice that compelled me to listen, over and over again, to songs like Melissa and Midnight Rider.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to hearhow Gregg Allman sounds today (in T-Bone Burnett's studio, at any rate), this is a great find.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I didn't think I'd like this guy as much, with him being an Idol winner, but I'm a huge DMB fan and Phillip Phillips has a similar voice. I've found the album is really great, though. Definitely surprised I enjoyed it as much as I have!
