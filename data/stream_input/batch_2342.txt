B0090P98Z4|4.0|Although somewhat of a clumsy way of navigation the graphics are great! Selecting tools is somewhat sufficient but could be easier for tablets
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|It was not only very entertaining, it has a great story line with a message of accepting others for what they have to offer!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|my daughter loves this series so we ordered it at a great price and it arrived on time and in brand new packaging
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I could not put the tablet down. A must buy if you are a fan of the walking dead story! If you are new to walking dead, read the comic first and then watch the show . Its also a good way to catch up too.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Seen the movie, decided to read the books and see if they were as good. And they are I would recommend them to everyone that would like reading.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Fun way to pass the time makes me giggle as its goes hitting seagulls and crashing into stuff wish coins built up faster but other than that quite enjoyable experience
0452289963|5.0|This book was a requested gift and the recipient appreciated it.  I have not read it and prefer different genres.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|From the very beginning of the book, I knew this was going to be a page turner.  I never expected all the twists and turns that Erin was going to experience.  Then, at the end of the book I was totally surprised at the chain of events.  I highly recommended this book.  It is a love story full of suspense, despair and ultimately, happiness.<br />BJA (Florida)
1401929281|4.0|This book could have more details.  There are advanced books about the same topic, though.  Good introduction although you could just go ahead and buy the advanced book right away.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Riveting, exciting, excellent storyline.  Julian Fellows has done it again in season 3.  I do hope it continues to S4.  Can hardly wait.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|great old sci-fi from early 70's I believe. the story holds up even though this is pre-star wars effects, etc.
B0095R64AO|4.0|The actors were very good. The story was more drama than comedy. Or a more serious comedy. We enjoy Jason Segel however and thus enjoyed the movie.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|classic escape from new York in high definition. one of my favorite movies of kurt Russell. this one comes with both dvd and Blu-ray versions which is nice to have, but nicer to see the Blu-ray with all it's detail.

B00BOXZAG6|1.0|I have found this item to be rated as a missleading advert, header suggests 3D + 2D Bluray and DVD combo included, box only indicates Bluray + DVD
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|A DEFINENTLY AWESOME MOVIE, DEFENTLY A TEAR JERKER.. MUST BUY THIS MOVIE, I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE IT. :):) GOOD.
B00321GTJU|5.0|The movie was superb! Very beautifully photographed, expertly narrated and beneficial to any upper level science class.<br />I recommend it and the entire series through Amazon!
B00338QELU|4.0|You have a feeling that you know how it will end but getting there is done so masterfully that you appreciate the writer's skill.
B00003CXXS|5.0|DVD arrived in perfect condition and the movie is very educational. I showed it to my 10th grade Biology classes and the students learned a lot from the movie!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|The whole approach using &#34;live&#34; singing adds to the dramatic effect and makes the performances outstanding. The huge spread of the action is overwhelming.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The beginning was a bit slow but the second half of the book was great. The story line was not what I expected, pleasantly surprised!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Concentrated time period piece with great screenplay, cinematography, direction and superb acting. A must see film production. well worth the time and price.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. Every week I am bummed when it is over and can't wait for the new show. It is nice to be able to purchase them on amazon and get through a whole season without having to wait week to week for the next episode.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Had a good time. Not too many hidden object puzzles. Good mini puzzles. Would like to see hints for mini puzzles, not just a skip option.
0345531957|5.0|I am not finished with it yet but it is a great story.  I strongly recommend it.  It came very fast also
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is fun to see if you can outwit the game.  Makes you have to think and use your brain.  I like (and need!) brain exercises.  I'm still learning all of the ins-and-outs and how it works, but so far it's fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it lets u feed and take care of your horse. u can compete in horse compition. u can even even buy knew horses.take note that u can change the name of your horse and character.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Not really expensive and the kids enjoyed it. They don't always play with it, but here and there they do. I'd prefer it over the actual game because it has them be a little creative  on how to set up their own level. There are other sets that you can put them all together and it just adds to their fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An amazing game I love everything about it I love the new save me keys I want them to come out with more<br />Of the citys
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting easy read. Reader gets to hear events and plots from both characters leading to the demise of their marriage.
B0091REZMW|5.0|no matter how far you get you won't finish this game. Really worth it. I've been playing everyday and I need friends and away to get diamonds.
6305718954|4.0|I had seen this movie before and liked it enough to buy.Would not recommend for younger children maybe too scary.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Marked is a very good start for this series. Its about Zoey who get marked by a vampire but not bitten. She gets marked with a tattoo and it becomes very intresting the mythlolgy of vampires stays the same but changes ever so slightly. The characters are diverse and you can identitfy with anyone of the main cgaracters. Zoey is on a long journey to become a vampire and this just amps it up and it only gets better after.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Such a good movie.Love it when one mother tells her daughter considering divorce that &#34;it is her that will be found&#34;.
0765325950|5.0|I read the first one and was hooked on the series. I now have all 14 books. They were all good including A Memory of Light.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony and all were great; Lady Gaga was unbelievable! Had no idea she could belt out a number like that. Queen Letefa (sp) wasn't half bad either!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very compelling and loved how the characters came came together.  If you like historical war novels this is a great one.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Very enjoyable. Take it for what it is...fiction. I could not see where any opsec was compromised. This is one of the best &#34;who dun it&#34; movies I have seen in some time. K. Bigalow and J. Chastain should have received an acadamy award.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|A great challenging match 3 game. Really enjoyed it. Recommend this one for match 3 lovers. Just started playing and already addicted.
B007REV4T8|4.0|THis is a very gritty, hard hitting Bond. J. Bardem play a very good role albeit wierd. I enjoyed the train scene.
B004159Y98|5.0|Almost every song on this cd is worth the price.  Its not often that I can listen to every song and not want to skip as it comes around.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is an extremely tough camping tool with a blade that runs through the handle. The pommel will act as a hammer. This is up for any job other than surgery
B000ICXQXI|5.0|This is classic Hitchcock.  My daughter had never seen it but loves the genre of criminal minds.  We sat and watched it, my watching her as much as the movie, to see how effective this movie can still be in our present society.  In her words, &#34;creepy!&#34;.  Although the death scenes may have been a bit unorthodox, the emotional setting, camera angles and brilliant job by Mr. Perkins still makes this movie stand out as one of the greatest of our time.  Any movie that can still be scary and creepy after 50 years is truly in a catagorie with few others.
B005LAIGYQ|3.0|Weak in spots and the plot is predictable. I prefered Zero Dark Thirty better. It's worth having in the collection.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved it.......the book is full of twists and turns.  I was hooked after the first page.  Just shows evil can be anyone
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Very happy with the movie! It arrived just in time for Easter!  I would highly recommend this movie to the family!
B002TJLEY6|5.0|This book goes far beyond my expectations. It is enlightening, fascinating.<br />I will recommend it to all of my friends.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome, it's the best game I've ever played on my fire.<br />If you like this game you'll love the PC version. Love this game and can't wait till the next update is out.<br />  -MR. COOL
0553378384|5.0|I love this book.  It gives such clear information and it is easy to understand.  It is a go-to book for me --- full of pertinent information.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to gain more insight into astrology.
B0082SU98U|5.0|This book was the sweetest thing, all about a little orphan girl who spreads gladness and cheer to a unhappy town. I rate this 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who enjoys beautiful stories.<br />Enjoy, and keep playing the game!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|While I'm still amazed at the special effects in all of Peter Jackson's movies, in too many places this movie felt like a patchwork quilt of the LOTR trilogy.
B007REV4T8|5.0|What can you say about James Bond/Daniel Craig?  Terrific performance and movie.  Fast paced.  Some incredible stunts (not unusual, of course, for Double 007!).  Loved the background of James Bond's youth and his family manor.  Judi Dench was superb as usual and her demise was unexpected, but somehow fitting in keeping with the movie's plot.  Ralph Fiennes was a hoot and fit right into his character.  Albert Finney gave a right-good performance as Skyfall's caretaker.  He was believable, looked and acted comfortable and down-to-earth - and had some funny lines  to boot!  Another keeper!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It is not ms word but it is not for a computer. In addition, it is free so it is a good thing to allow you to make notes etc when needed.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Oh my, I want to live in Hobbit Land!  &#34;Lived Up To and Beyond My Expectations.&#34;  Peter Jackson is a genius;  the actors perfectly cast; the sets utterly stupendous; the make-up absolutely the best; the costumes unbelievably created and the villians are what you love to hate!  SEE THIS MOVIE - It's what a movie should be:  Incredibly Fascinating.  If you think you've got problems, get a load of what Hobbits have to put up with!  (I think I was a Hobbit in another life - I'm not crazy about their feet - but I LOVE their houses and villages!!)
B009DH372Y|5.0|Remember Queen from this time frame...loved the video...got my husband to be a fan, too.  and we certainly aren't in the young group.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Oh, Boy.  What a fascinating take on Abraham Lincoln.  Shrewd, humorous, political savvy up the wazoo, and kind, sensitive, considerate and tough all in one tall, lanky personage that gave our country more than we could have ever thanked him properly for.  An interesting take on Mary Tood Lincoln and for this interrpretation, Sally Field did some fine acting.  The battle scenes were horrific, the losses suffered on each side dreadful and explicitly emphasized why &#34;War is Waste&#34;.  The shifting around in the scenes was a bit irritating at first, but as things proceeded, you were drawn into each scene as each character was filled in and shown who they were and how they felt on the events of the time.  Daniel-Day Lewis gave a fine performance.  Tommy Lee Jones performed the crafy, political savvy rustic coot to perfection.  Steven Spielberg? Another &#34;Bravo!  Bravo!&#34;
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Does everything I need it to do! Glad that I got it. The layout is better than other readers, and it works great on my kindle.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Unbelievable. Eye Opening. A must read. It changed my way of looking at what I eat forever. Thank you Robert Kenner for publishing this book.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I waited a long time for the last movie in the saga to be done (Part 1 & 2) before I would buy just the Part 1.  My patience paid off by getting both Parts 1 & 2 and very reasonable rates compared to other places.  The picture quality is awesome.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Picked it up during Spring Break and finished it in about 4 reading sessions in a day and a half (aka, couldn't put it down).<br /><br />I liked it so much I read the whole thing on my phone's Kindle App!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Live these books. His humor is still dry but I would love to see this one into a movie. Sandra Bullock as Neagley.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book in the Hunger Games trilogy does not disappoint. Just as good as the first in the series if not better.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The way this is written will make it hard for some to read. But I enjoyed the interview style and the mixture of actual historic facts with fiction.
B0013ND30M|5.0|this movie is my classic favorite movie and couldn't wait to show my daughter and when i bought it wow it was amazing looked better than years ago.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Nice pace to the movie but equally good dialogue and interaction between characters.  I don;t go for action movies but this one is much, much more.  James is stellar.  Don;t think because he's surrounded by &#34;big&#34; Hollywood actors he won't hold hi own, because he does so much more, scene after scene, after scene!  I don't care who you originally watched the movie to see.  You will remember James McAvoy!
0345529057|5.0|After seeing the show first,playing the terrible game on 360 and waiting for season 3 to start, I ordered these books to bridge the gaps. The screen play did not differ really too much from what I have read so far, but this is something I am currently reding. Minor things change for tv, but I remember certain lines from the tv show as I am reading them. Great book and series.
075669812X|5.0|my son likes this book very much<br />it is very good and full of pictures<br />my son likes pictures and explanations about caracters
B00B69UQEO|5.0|DM does it again!!  Interesting programing, sounds and beats.  The ability to make even mundane words feel meaningful and important.
0062127241|4.0|The title apropos for the content of this book.  For all us Who fans who searched for the meaning behind the lyrics its all here for the reader.  Excellent read and very enlightening.
0811877485|3.0|I guess I didn't realize these wouldn't stick to my textured walls. We have an old house with old texturing and these stickers won't stick to them at all. :(
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love having the Complete Series.  No comurcials. I can watch it anytime, I want.  This Series is very good, I wish there were more on TV like this.  They came on time when expected and in very good condition.  Thanks.
1416550550|3.0|This story contains a wicked queen, a beautiful, but sickly princes, a poor man who is a gifted artist.  This man, practically a pauper, marries the beautiful, frail princess.  The couple are very much in love, but the princess becomes despondent because she wants a baby.  Her mother, the wicked queen, worries about the health of the beautiful princess.  Her daughter is too frail and sickly for childbirth.  Then a fairy brings the couple a baby girl.  The princess is enraptued with the little girl.  Rose is happy, smiles again.  There are two wicked, evil men who it would be best never to meet.  These two signify danger.  The book is set along the spectacular, beautiful coast of Cornwall.  There is a beautiful, hidden garden that is hard to find, hard to get to.    The story is told by three characters, all ladies.  It begins in 1900, goes into 1913, 1975, ends in 2005.  Eliza, one of the ladies, and her twin brother Sammy, are products of a Dickens childhood.  Her mother had died leaving the twins alone.  She was a beautiful woman from a wealthy family who ran away with a young sailer.  Both were very much in love.  He drowned at sea.  She had her twins, Eliza and Sammy, then died when these two were about twelve.  The small family lived in a tiny rundown attic in the poor, slovenly section of London.  The landlord and landlady took advantace of these kids and worked them hard, keeping them working constantly.  They threatened to throw them out in the street.  Eliza was told to fear her mothers' family, told there would be a bad man looking for her.  The young girl was told to be afraid, very afraid.    The story begins in London 1913.  A four year old girl is left aboard a ship sailing for Australia.  The child is told to be very quiet, not tell her name or give any information.  Her only possession is a small suitcase containing a book of fairytales.  She has some money which a woman steals from her.  The ship docks.  Noone comes for this child.  Time passes.  The child is adopted into a family of girls.  Then the shock.  When she is grown and her adoptive mother has died, her father tells her she is adopted.  Nell, that's what she is named, has forgotten about her past life.    The story carries on to Nells' granddaughter Cassandra.  Cassandra has spent time with her grandmother since she was ten.  Her grandmother is her guardian, her mother left grandma to bring up her daughter.  She is an indifferent mom.    Nell has always wondered who she is or where she belongs in this world.  She leaves Australia to find herself.  She goes to Cornwall and inquires about what has happened many years ago.  The people she speaks to are very interesting.  She buys a house in Cornwall which contains the \\"Forgotten Garden.\\"  The book of fairytales has led her to Cornwall, to this house.  So she buys it intending to move here.  But it doesn't work out.  She has her granddaughter.  Cassandra, after her grandmother dies feels she must find out why her grandmother went to Cornwall and bought this particular house.  Why did Grandma do this?  Cassandra is curious and interviews many of the same people her grandmother talked to now grown older.  And she now owns the house with the \\"Forgotten Garden.\\"    This is a bad man who must be feared.  He has kidnapped Eliza and brought her to the home of her wealthy but wicked uncle and her aunt the wicked queen who wants this child far away from her family.  The couple dislikes or even hate each other;  the father of the  beautiful princess dislikes her.  Eliza is full of life when Rose is so sickly and must always be careful of her health.    This book reminds me so much of books written by many English people.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|From the opening track High Wire to The mob rules... Legendary covers of some Legendary Artists. I can't say I have ever heard anyone do Covers with the same intensity. Adrenaline Mob are the real deal.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|The Iron Lady is the story of Margaret Thatcher, England's first (and only) female prime minister. She broke the glass ceiling in a male-minated world to become one of the most influential women in history, holding office longer than any other PM in the 20th century.  Told through a series of flashbacks long after she left office (and while suffering from dementia), viewers unfamiliar with Thatcher get the opportunity to experience her entry into politics, rise to power, and ultimate ousting from office by members of her own political party. While I was excited about learning more about a woman who I knew little about initially, I was a bit disappointed that they chose to diminish her story by including the dementia as a major plot device (and I really hate the use of flashbacks to move a story along); I would have preferred a straight bio-pic of her accomplishments and impact on the political process. Chameleon Meryl Streep vanishes into the role, embodying Thatcher from her dialet to the Betty Croker hairstyle.
B000A0K2JO|4.0|Does exactly what it is supposed to do. I would like it to be a little bit smaller, but I've never seen any smaller USB to PS/2 adapters, and this price for this one is great.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|If you would have told me that Jen from \\"Dawson's Creek\\" would someday morph into Marilyn Monroe, I would have laughed.  Michelle Williams literally disappears into the iconic role, portraying the actress during the filming of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\"  as she battelsd her insecuriteis while attempting to branch into a more dramatic role starring opposite Sir Lawrence Olivier.  Kenneth Brannagh, whose own career has so many comparisons to Olivier, portrays the actor/director who is less than enthusiastic to have the starlet on the set with all her drama. The story revolves around the relationship that developed between Colin Clark, a smitten aristocrat turned directors assitant and the starlet when he is assigned to be watch over her during the tense production.<br /><br />Great casting, with a veritable who's who of British thespians, including Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi, it is an entertaining look at a brief period in the tumultuous life of one of the worlds most famous and fragile actresses.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I went into this movie not expecting much but I quickly got into it. I felt that the little girl in the racing game was annoying at first but by the end I loved her and was rooting for her.
0385344333|4.0|I've read every Jack Reacher book and they're all good in my opinion.  But with any writer, some are bound to be better than others and I can understand why some fans were disappointed in \\"A Wanted Man.\\"  Not one guy or bunch of guys needed tuning up by Jack in this one.  A couple guys came close but thought better of it seeing Jack's busted nose and probably wondering what the other guy looked like.  Reacher only throws one punch in the whole book.  Still, I enjoyed it and it was an interesting story, albeit a more cerebral one than is typical Jack Reacher.  And there is certainly plenty of action toward the end with a slew of guys that need whacking getting summarily whacked by Jack.<br /><br />Don't pass it up on the negative reviews.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|This movie had a lot of the same issues that &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; had in my opinion. Bruce Wayne is too old to continue fighting crime. The brutal combat he is able to endure in this movie is totally unrealistic and I didn't really care for the movie as a whole however...<br /><br />This movie is a perfect setup to the second movie which I rate 5 stars. It's still a bit unrealistic but I enjoyed it so much more. You have to watch this one to really fully understand everything that's going on in the second one, which is WAY worth it.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|The only thing wrong with this movie is that it is over too soon.  Perhaps it should have been made into a &#34;series.&#34;  The story line and the directing were superb.
0345535421|5.0|I just can't get enough of these books. I have read the 5 in the series at least 3 times and am anxiously awaiting the next. I lost this one somewhere and had to replace it.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Couldn't fault this CD. You know what you are going to get from Mr Hayward and in the absence of new Moody Blues material, this is a must for all Moody fans.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book very interesting. I, myself, am a Family Nurse Practitioner. We are taught to only \\"believe\\" the things that are tangible and reproducible (science) but Dr. Alexander was given a rare glimpse at something wonderful, magnificent, and unexplainable. Love his story!
B00005NKW3|5.0|Of course I love it. Who doesn't? This movie IS Christmas. The movie was in fine condition when I received it and I'm still enjoying it. A Christmas time &#34;must have!&#34;

6301647734|5.0|If you've never seen &#34;Harvey&#34; DO get it. Hysterical!  Watch the actress who plays his sister closely. Her facial expressions alone will crack you UP! A classic with STAYING power!  Jimmy Stewart is a DOLL in this one! LOVE!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a very moving story. Few people love their country more than this hero.  Once past chapter 5, this book becomes totally addictive.
6300215717|5.0|I love this movie. The ending it rather sad but that's ok. The movie makes up for that. Order for a nice rainy day to snuggle in and watch that gorgeous Gregory Peck woo sweet Miss Hepburn. Note: When he puts his hand in the mouth of the carving in the cave, it wasn't rehearsed for him to SCREAM. Her reaction is genuine. ;)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I honestly like this game. It's pretty cool if you're looking for a game to play. It's not unsolvable, but there's definitely a challenge.
0788812807|5.0|Another purchase for the grandkids. LOVE to show them movies from when I was a child. The movie was in perfect condition and the kids adore it. Thanks!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This incredible series has a riveting story line, great acting, fabulous costumes and its all around beautifully well put together. Certainly worth seeing.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The first volume is almost a prolong. The story is compelling and well paced. The next 2 & 1/2 are like the beginning of a novel developing, but feel slow. The last book and a half bring an excellent story to completion. Don't read Wool in the volumes, read whole the omnibus at one time, or you'll quit and not realize what you're missing.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|If  you read nothing else this year read this book. I cried openly throughout. I suffered not only for James but for all the children in this fact-based story. You will count your own blessings when you finish.
B00BJNHACS|5.0|They did a great job with this game.  It's easy to learn but tough to master. The controls are really responsive as well.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a good game and had a great story line. I wish there were more levels and more mini games but overall this was a fun game and it is worth the time
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone, it's a very good funny movie that most married couples could watch together and enjoy.
B005LQ6UE8|4.0|This was a very exciting account of an escape by several inmates of the Soviet Gulag during WWII. before Hitler invaded Russia. The book was actually dictated to the person who wrote it down by Rawicz, who had been a Polish military officer prior to his capture by the Russians on trumped up spy charges (he had the misfortune of growing up close to the Russian border). The first part of the book describes his capture and the first of his long marches to the gulag, partly by mechanized transport and partly on foot in the dead of winter. The second part describes his calculated escape on foot during the dead of winter, in heavy snow, his long walk with his companions to the Russian border (acquiring a young girl refugee in the process), and his continued grueling experiences walking across Mongolia, China, The Gobi Desert,Tibet and thence into India. By then, half of the escapees and the young girl had died of thirst, hunger and exposure. The book ends with Rawicz being rescued by the British in India.<br /><br />This was a very exciting book to read, although the nature of the prose is not very sophisticated. Its value is in the story, however. I found myself frustrated with Rawicz's and his companions in their choice of route, which led to disaster for half the group. So paranoid were these escapees that they did not fully realize that they were essentially safe once outside Russia (this was when China was still not Communist and an ally of the US). As a result they bypassed the safety of a small caravan which undoubtedly would have led them to a sizable Chinese city, and chose to march across the most horrendously difficult terrain imaginable. Although Rawicz had no idea that Hitler had turned on Russia during his flight,  Instead the fugeatives spent another year walking  and suffering across unbelievable terrain. I was disappointed that he did not elaborate on his reactions upon being rescued and on his eventual sanctuary in Britain where he met his wife (his original wife and children died in the war by the time of his capture). That alone could have made a wonderful story. Still, it is a story highly worth reading.inal wife and children died in the war by the time of his capture). That alone could have made a wonderful story. Still, it is a story highly worth reading.
B005ES1FBQ|5.0|I wear a 9.5 womens regular shoe so Crocs are always fun for me to decide what size to buy. Some run large, some run small. These happen to run smaller than many of the other crocs I have. I ordered a 9, and they came in short. My toes rubbed the ends and I hate that feeling so I gritted my teeth for a couple days and now they're very comfortable. I wanted these because I have developed a terrific case of plantar fasciitis after a winter of flat boots. These are doing a very good job of helping me to heal from that! Plus they're cute.. for Crocs. Sometimes they're so ugly they're adorable. Right? Ha... anyway, I don't care what my feet look like if they're not hurting. That's what happens when you get older, you realize cute feet don't matter.
B00026WU64|5.0|It seems kind of strange, reviewing a Bob Dylan album fifty years after it was released. In those 50 subsequent years, Bob has been dissected, sliced, and diced to the point that I wonder if anything fresh can written about him, and certainly nothing more can I add.<br /><br />So why am I writing a review that doesn't need to be written? I've followed Bob's career off and on since the 60s. My first \\"new\\" Dylan album that I purchased was Blood On The Tracks. I was 16 years old. I bought some others over the years. But with the waning of the CD format, back catalog Dylan CDs are popping up everywhere. My collection of Bob Dylan CDs has exploded, and hence I will be sharing my thoughts on each CD.<br /><br />What I like about Freewheelin' is that Bob is staying somewhat within the framework of folk, but he's already pushing against the boundaries. I like to listen to this when I want \\"folkie Bob\\" and its the lyrics that grab my attention. Songs like Hard Rain, Masters of War, Don't Think Twice, and Girl From The North Country are lyrically genius and remain classics to this day.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I don't need to say much about this book except that it is the foundation for everything.  Do you want to raise your consciousness and be happier, the do the exercises in this book.  And the real point is that the book is a 28 day program to magic in your life.
0763644765|5.0|Our toddler loves this book.  Big colorful pages, a funny story involving potty's, a dog and a cat.  And in the end, triumph.  What more could you ask for?  We read this daily.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I LOVE this game! I just wish the full version wasn't so much... I went through all the levels in just a few days and want more!!! It will probably be my next game purchase... I just don't like spending more than a few dollars on games.
B009AMALGM|1.0|Rinse. Lather. Repeat.<br /><br />Ho hum. Nothing new. Can we just end this series already?  This is just getting ridiculous.  I think they need to have a final, all out battle film that is NOT \\"found footage\\" but rather a full narrative.  No more cut from camera to camera to camera. No more menacing coven women(and it hasn't escaped my notice that they are made to look like feminist academics), no more Katie Featherston having her big moment in the final few minutes.<br /><br />I just want one big final culmination followed by a merciful \\"The End.\\"
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I ordered this as an Easter basket gift. It was VERY well received. I like that it has a DVD for current use, as well as a Blu-ray so it won't be obsolete as fast.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Fun watching for anyone who likes pop sci-fi like Star Trek TNG or Babylon 5.  Great follow on to Stargate SG1.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The story got off to a slow beginning but made up for it fast! I won't go in to details but if you enjoyed the first book you will be impressed with the second! Enjoy!
1476734941|4.0|I read the book and the fast diet has been working for me. I like how simple it is, but would have liked more recipe ideas for low cal meals.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is a GREAT movie for families to watch.  Men & Women alike.  Men are featured to step up and be Men of God and to take responsibility but it is also the faithful women behind them that helps them to be ALL that they can be!!  LOVE THIS MOVIE
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I downloaded it for Kindle Fire in June 2012 & so far I don't have any complaints!  It works well for viewing documents etc.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have a Apo for minecraft pocket edition for my kindle and I love it but they need to have a lite version. That would be awesome.
B006GKHE6G|1.0|this isnt a good game!! ittl take all ur money!!i downloded 5 games and it took all my money and till noe it still wont download! !! dont get
155890641X|5.0|I know it's VHS, but I also know it can be transferred to a DVD format. My earliest childhood memory was reading, and watching this classic of classics. I knew it MUST be in my video collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is filled with action and romance. I started reading it out of curiosity and couldn't put it down! Finished it in one day. Can't wait to read the next one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I literally could not put this book down.  I read it in one day (until I had to put it down because I was sobbing uncontrollably!)  It was 3 days before I could re-open the book and read the last few pages.  Beautifully crafted story of unconditional love and the strange twists and turns of life.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|I think this app gets borring after playing over and over and over especially without Wi-Fi  but l can not delete it either because my mom and dad would get mad at me
B00B7Y0206|1.0|but to do anything else, rate, download, ect..... you have to sign in to your google account and then give then access.  NOT, that is crazy.  I am not giving any one or company I dont know access to my email or personal accounts.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Great dancing, great music. (As I recall, Cousin Brucie chose the songs.) Probably the best movie Patrick Swayze ever made.
B004SIP71M|5.0|After seeing this at the movies, later on Cable, I want to see it and share it with my family and friends. The title alone is enough to tease you into watching it! And ------- Amazon has it available at such a great price! (What did we ever do before this company came into our life?)
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I think everyone should watch this movie. It seems strange to me that Madonna, who has made so many bad films would not have been recognized more for this film which is a real gem!!!
0802473156|5.0|Great Book. It was very enlightening. I highly recommedn others read also. I enjoyed it. Be blessed all of you.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|i loved the game but when i get to hammerhead it earases my all my game data. Fix this flaw and ill love the game.
B004CURZFC|5.0|this has been one of my all time favorites , if any one wants a heart lifting moment in their life then watch this movie .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The way Nicholas Sparks wrote this book was so vivid and detailed. Seeing what was going  on was easy, it was amazing.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|If you love Jimi you will love this,some of the same stuff,some new but still Hendrix,I could listen to him anytime
B00632HWOG|3.0|I have used YAHOO mail for years.  However, someone got my contact list and sent spam out to everyone.  I changed my password more than once in a month and the same thing kept happening.  I still have Yahoo mail but I only use it for stuff that is not priority mail.  I changed to another mail service for my friends and family communications.
0525478817|3.0|it's ok but maybe for a younger audience than I am (age 65).... too much like real life medical stories
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I just got done watching this on demand through my Cable provider. I actually will admit to watching it twice because I'm having a Lazy Sunday!<br /><br />This is just an awesome documentary looking at one of the most legendary recording studios in music. If you are a fan of rock music that was made in the 70's, 80's, 90's...you'll enjoy this quite a bit. It's worth the $5 or $6, and I will likely buy it on DVD or download it at some point as well.<br /><br />The documentary looks at the beginning of the studio, the first bands to record there and big albums. Interviews with tons of well known music artists and producers are mixed with Sound City employees sharing their memories of working at the studio.<br /><br />It also shows the change, either good or bad, between old-school tape recording and the shift in the music industry to using digital production and computer programs like Pro Tools to produce records quicker and cheaper. The documentary, not surprisingly, tries to make the point that the old way was better, but really, that's subjective.<br /><br />The final part shows Dave Grohl purchasing the Neve mixing console (what made artists come to Sound City) when Sound City went out of business in 2011. It follows the move and hook-up of the equipment in his own studio and the creation of new music on the same recording console by a number of artists who recorded at Sound City in the past.<br /><br />This is the first film that I've felt moved to purchase and view right away in years (I'm not really into movies much) and I highly recommend it to music fans of the period of time between the 1970's and 1990's.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is not your typical match 3 game. If is much more challenging with multiple levels creating hours of enjoyment.
B008KZVNLC|5.0|Again I enjoyed this series as it is English drama it can be dramatic but that is the enjoyment of watching period pieces
0743270754|5.0|I've read many historical biographies and I thought I knew a lot about Lincoln and this era.  I learned so much!  You can tell the amazing amount of research she devoted to this project, frequently quoting her primary sources.  Her writing is so insightful, with not only reporting of the events, but her analysis is very clear.  It reads almost like fiction and is an accessible but scholarly work.
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|This is cute.  Enjoyed this book from the library, super quick.  Laughed at Maddie balancing on tiny little things, and the patient look on her face.
0345525558|4.0|I liked the correlation between the meaning of flowers and the emotions of the people .... a new way to communicate one's thoughts .
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Love the game except for the free buck system that doesnt pay out and the lack of resonse when there is an issue.Complain and they take you off the free  buckram option.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good profuct. It also changes a place over the earth every month. Each time this happens an exclusive character and board is realsed. You may be able to have fun with different characters boards and money.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Bought from amazon end nov 12. Started watching recently, (mar/apr12), as i had bought other stuff at the same time. 2nd disc was untouched until i put it in machine. Scratched, damaged, i am stuck with it as Amazon policy is valid until end January 2013. 2 months should be fine but when a disc is messed up, and never used, what can you do. Amazon should do the right thing.<br /><br />Update May 20th: Amazon sent a new set of discs when I complained, despite refund period expiring. Kudos to Amazon customer service. This is why I tell people who are looking for stuff \\"just amazon it\\" as in search on amazon.<br /><br />Great show, which was never an issue. It was always a BD issue - damaged disc.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Best show I've watched in a long time!  It makes me want to keep watching one episode after another!  Awesome!
0812973992|5.0|It is a book.<br />It has words.<br />Words I could read.<br /><br />It was as I expected.<br /><br />Now I am just using up extra characters so that I can click submit.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I will be the first to say that The Hobbit and LOTR movies are not my style....that being said, I watch them because my husband is a fan and after watching this movie I fell in love with the story. I even purchased the book so I could understand all the history that is mentioned. This movie was well made. I loved the music and the characters were all entertaining and chosen perfectly.
B007NG93CK|5.0|love Kathy Reichs, cant wait for the next book.  can never put it down. Once you start you cant stop
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had me so rattled.  I couldn't decide if I liked the husband, if I blamed him, and then I couldn't decide if I liked the wife, or if I blamed HER.  There were so many twists and turns, stupid moves, etc. that it became difficult to like either one of them.  I HATED the ending.  Several of my friends have read it too, and we all agreed on that point.  I'm intrigued to read her other books but after this emotional roller coaster I'm not sure if I have the stomach for it.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This a romantic fairy tale which exposes evil in the early 19th century  in France. Those evils exist today; Poverty, child abuse, excessive riches, the law's indifference to suffering and the blind enforcement of unjust law. Hugo was a socialist and radical who thought revolution not a bad thing to shake up those in power. He did not object to profit and the creation of wealth but wealth should  be shared equitably not<br />equally.The real crime was poverty and the degradation of human beings particularly women and children.He viewed the prison as monstrous. If you read Les Miserables get a volume newly translated with an ample preface, footnotes. The .99 cent version was most probably translated in the 19 th century and contains many words not found in a dictionary. Hugo needed a good editor he is highly repetitive in addition to a veryhigh degree of digression some of which is interesting and some baffling with reference to obscure personages both historical and mythic.<br /><br />Jean Valjean truly a saint who bears guilt for really nothing in a word he feels guilt when society should bear the onus for his poverty and degradation. Hugo is clearly a believer and he has created two characters Vajean and the Bishop who turns him toward the light as saints and martyrs.<br /><br />Jabert is pictured as a pitiless functionary enforcing the law against all. Faced with realization that Valjean saved his life he is confronted the<br />will of the law and the higher will of God with his command of forgiveness and mercy. This conflict isintolerable to Jabert and leads to his suicide when confronted with convict turned saint. This book will live on particularly it's glorious plot which has fathered numerous films and of course the musical which captures the essence of the book.
B00A83075M|5.0|Wow, I bought this movie because a friend of mine really wanted to see it. I do NOT regret it I loved it, it was intriguing and cute and funny. Will definitely be one that I watch over and over again.
B00ANGICRE|3.0|Very white bread. Hunt was awesome, Macy was great, Hawkes was good. The rest was just meh, only ok not great.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is my first automatic watch. The price worked out great for my first venture . I changed the band to a classier leather band. The watch looks good and has been keeping great time. I will probably invest in a watch winder as i do not wear it daily. I will buy another Seiko 5.
B008B68IUY|5.0|My granddaughters needed a Monster High vehicle and by looking at this picture I never thought they could fit their dolls in here. WOW! When I opened the box from the mail was I ever surprised! They can fit four dolls in here. I'm sure they know how big it is but I had never seen one, I was afraid to order it. Grandmothers, don't be afraid! It is worth every penny and the price is really very good anyway.
B00BG08FKK|1.0|If I'm buying a so called deluxe edition of a movie soundtrack then it better have all of the songs from the movie on it.<br /><br />After listening to various versions of the musical for years I could get past the fact that they took out the \\"I broke a window pane\\" line. I also got over my disappointment of thinking the Master Of The House song was going to be awesome, it wasn't.<br /><br />I cannot get over the fact that I paid more money for something that was supposed to be better and they hacked the songs. I am most disappointed, no, ANGRY, that they hacked half of the first dang song in the movie ! Are you kidding me ? ! I put it in my stereo all giddy and happy to listen to it and then what I was supposed to hear wasn't there !<br /><br />There is an address on the back of the crappy paper case, which I already accidentally ripped, and I intend to send a very sternly written letter to all the douchebags that are sitting back laughing with with my money in their pockets. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE PIRATE MUSIC ! Stop pulling crap like this !
B007V2UGPE|4.0|great game i must have fun for hours cool power up cant wait for the next game i like all the power ups
0307887898|3.0|Face it folks, if you are a fan of self help/business books, there is really no ground breaking new methods that you will learn from this or really any new self help book.  Being that I have read a bit on the topic of lean manufacturing, this book served as an amazing reminder of things I forgot.<br /><br />PROS<br />I loved how Eric Reis applied many of the lean concepts into his tech start up.<br />I also loved the examples of other companies and how they've evolved through their application of the concepts<br /><br />CONS<br />The first 2/3 of the books is filled with tons of great stuff, the last third is sooooooooooooooo boring and mostly fluff.<br /><br />However, if you are a business owner, future business owner, or someone who wants to rise to the top, I would definitely recommend the book... but don't worry if you can't finish it... the meat of the book is definitely not at the end!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|just hated the ending.  Was looking for more and now whating for the next to come out on DVD.  When does it plan on coming
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|game very fun tutorial is clearly shown but lower prices for gems and coins but still deserves 5 star rating
B00BF11STU|2.0|This was very, very slow in at least the first hour.  Almost documentary.  Could have been better.  I was disappointed.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Am sooo happy I found this among other CDs that I had been searching for.  Interestingly, his family is releasing music found lately in old archives not produced when he was alive.  There is another recent new release but I forget the title.
B0087EVHVW|4.0|My first unit to use in a new pc.  I will over clock it to see how it works at higher settings but so far runs a little better than the AMD chip I used to run. I am sure it runs quieter and not as hot.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This movie is awesome. The entire true concept is upon taking the red pill, (A very strong robo cough gel) He disconnects from the reality, the prison that is the matrix.<br /><br />Robitussin is a dissociative and contains a chemical DXM, that can give you out of body experiences, also allow you to feel and hear secret frequencies inaudible to the normal ear, and yes, allows you to disconnect from this reality, upon waking up, you realize that you are a prisoner and a slave to this system. Upon coming down and returning to your body, you find yourself again, a prisoner in the matrix.<br /><br />But it sure is one heaven of a ride for those 8 hours on 4th plateau! 5 STARS! I recommend this movie with some robo cough gels, 2 or 3 bottles of them. Have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003EYVXXW|3.0|This is an OK movie.  I enjoy finding movies that I can watch over and over and this is not one of those.  Not so much as a really history story but again it is an ok movie
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Even though her newer books have taken a complicated, psycho, third person, story, they are still good. I would like to see less complicated personal analysis and mire medical examiner discourse, but that is the author's new style.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|James Bond - the way it should be!  Like the original James Bond and not the cartoon of the 80's!
B0045HCJ8U|5.0|I watch this a couple of times a month, as I do not use TV and it reminds me of home in old New Orleans.  It is loaded with great acting and I even had to watch it in college as an assignment due to the remarkable production techniques and superb acting.  Of course Marlon Brandon is super fine and hot to watch, even for 1951 standards of cinematography.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love Kim the new girl and I like Frank is so my brother is really good and my sister's good to and me to and I have to say I love this game
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Thank you Ms Cain for this amazing book. I would give 10 stars of possible! I am an introvert. I have always experienced life from the outside looking in at the others who seemed more socially adept. It took the words of a teacher to help me realize that introspection was a wonderful thing. This book crystallized the introvert experience better than I could imagine. Cain shows that there is tremendous power in staying true to your quiet self.<br />I have already recommended this book to numerous people and will continue to recommend it to others. My hope it's that this becomes required reading for people in leadership: teachers, principals, CEOs and managers, just to name a few.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun game. slow at times. over all.... good fun game for the whole family!! my kids even play it.
0062200909|5.0|Arrived on time and in great shape. Exactly what I was looking for, couldn't have asked for better. Blah Blah.
B0043UB1LA|2.0|This movie was a big disappointment, I really like both the stars, movie really wasn't up to my liking at all.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I know every scene and line in this movie and nothing has ever made me laugh so much in my whole life!!
B0000028WD|4.0|It is mostly a tribute to Bob by other performers. Only three songs done by Bob. Some of the songs were not done well by the artists,but that is true most of the time.
B00846REIS|5.0|This series makes you feel like you are sitting right there. It's very captivating. I am on pins and needles awaiting the third book! Come on June!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is another great time waster with out a lot of noise, and flashy graphics.<br />I also like that you can turn off the timer, altho, it is only for statistics for the online poles, (which.. whatever..)<br />Far easier to play on the kindle fire, as the zooming is bigger.. but works find on my S3.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Arrived on time and in great shape. Exactly what I was looking for, couldn't have asked for better. Blah Blah.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this.  Ender wiggins is one those characters that you love.  A boy hero.  Sad but great at the same time.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|My kids cannot get enough of this movie. Long after Christmas, they regularly watch it. The hopping eggs were a huge hit at Easter. Fun little something extra.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I like this game a lot. Action packed not too hard and easy to catch on to. Occupies time when I am standing in line at the store nor whatever. Good game. Good game. Good game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game needs different scenarios.I enjoy playing this game. It causes me to really get into it as it speeds up. Oh and thanks for the blue keys they come in handy
030758836X|4.0|It's not hard to flip through this thriller quickly.  Nice twists and turns.  Looking forward to the big screen rendition.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Arrived on time and in great shape. Exactly what I was looking for, couldn't have asked for better. Blah Blah.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As, always,. Baldacci came through with a novel to hold the reader spellbound to the end.  Always looking forward to the next one.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I liked the old layout better. I'm not sure why there was a need to change it. If the app developers desire another update then I suggest going back to what it was because it was easier to read.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Very good fast-paced game. I get frustrated having to either stop playing, buy hearts,or ask people for them.If they were to remove the heart factor, this game would probably be one of my top five favorites.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|As long as you avoid the in game purchases its great. All the mission are doable even without spending money
0767824571|5.0|My sisters and I love these Monty Python classics- this is, of course, our favorite! The film itself is obviously on a budget and not very advanced, but still hilarious! I'm sure I've memorized all the lines, but it still makes me laugh just as much as the first time I saw it! A great addition to my movie collection!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Arrived on time and in great shape. Exactly what I was looking for, couldn't have asked for better. Blah Blah.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Bought this for my Mother-in-law who is from Canada.  She loves the royal family and she loved this movie.  I enjoyed it very much too
B000002GYR|5.0|This was the first Tom Waits album I ever heard way back when. I became an instant fan and have stayed a fan throughout the years. This album is full of Tom Waits classics. If you are already a Tom Waits fan you need this album, if you don't know Waits this album will get you hooked.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It really is a good book, dated but good.  I might have enjoyed it even more had I read it as a child.  Chances are I wont read it again, but I would recommend it.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Nice collection... I own the Jimi Hendrix collection. It was a nice addition. I recommend it to all Jimi Hendrix fans. It is worth.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love, love it!  I received this in time to get caught up on season two prior to the new season starting on March 31st - it was awesome!
B009O07NDY|5.0|Arrived on time and in great shape. Exactly what I was looking for, couldn't have asked for better. Blah Blah.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|There is just something that draws me towards the Eagles. I haven't figured out wheather its the music or the lyrics. I just gotta have them. Excellant set. A must have for the early collector
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|2013 is a great year for music. What can I say?<br />A lot of albums I've been waiting, seemingly ages for, are finally arriving.<br />This is one of those albums I've been just dying for.<br />The North Borders is a fantastic follow up to Black Sands. The album that made me fall in love with Bonobo.<br />Every song is spot on, and unique. I feel with the mellow jams, he could have kept going on with this formula for ages, simply incorporating different singers and different instruments.<br />The biggest pro, I'd say, is the bass. It seems like a lot of artists lately just don't know how to utilize a good old bass guitar the way Bonobo does.<br />I don't really have a con, but I would have liked to see Triana back in this album. None of the singers, or songs, really have that insane heart melting sound that could be found in songs from Black sands like &#34;The Keeper&#34; But that's OK I guess. It's still a better album and a vast majority of artist put out.<br />Best experienced as an album, rather than song by song. So buy the whole thing!
B0064O927I|1.0|I've worn this watch for less than two months and the strap broke. I didn't manhandle the watch so it just seems like a bad product to me.
0375812024|3.0|This is a thin paperback book that tells the story of a visit to the airport.  In traditional Scarry fashion, it features chaotic, detailed illustrations with lots of objects/people labeled.  It shows children how the airport works and teaches airport-related vocabulary.  Of course, it includes many fantastical and ridiculous elements as well, which is what makes Scarry's books so much fun.  Children just soak these books up... yes, there is a storyline, but there is so much to look at and talk about that it's not really the focus of the book.  I love how my 2-year-old accepts the most absurd elements of the book (for example, the mustard blimp) with wide-eyed sincerity.  It makes for an entertaining time for both parent and child.<br /><br />Like other Scarry books, this one has thin, cheap paper pages, which makes it less durable.<br /><br />The reason I took away two stars is that the book we received is printed in such a way that the left- and right-hand pages of each spread are misaligned, often by more than an inch.  It doesn't detract from my son's enjoyment of the book, but it's not the quality I would expect.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|fun, but it gets a big too campy for me compared to the first one.  plus, the bit with the 'sea plane' is a complete farce.  Nice to see all of them together, but I think the script COULD have been better.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i like this battery app. it's much easier to check battery life rather than having to go to the menu options.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I have purchased at least 8 of these DVD's. I love it so much that 7 of them have been gifts. The lasor and light show is superb
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this as a birthday present for my sister. She loves it! Came as described, unopened, and arrived at my house on time.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|I am not a huge fan of Bon Jovi, but I bought this cd. And did no mistake. It arrived rather fast, by the way. Here you have music for easy listening. There are a few very good songs. Very nice singning on Amen. A must have for soft rock-hard/n/heavy fans.
B00BVVA138|5.0|Another awesome album from the best metal band out there, Kill Switch! This is a must have if you dig metal with great lyrics!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This DVD/CD is the best, and I don't always say that!  You look into the private world of Adele when watching the DVD, and what a spectacular place - The Royal Albert Hall.  Adele's heartfelt introduction to her best friend; her sad, melancholy and at times funny reflections on the songs and why she wrote them are all perfectly good reasons to watch the DVD.  If you just like Adele, you will love her music after this encounter.  Sit back, relax and be prepared to be entertained!  The CD has all Adele's hit songs and more. One incredible voice.  Only disappointment was that the CD is not a complete version of the concert.  I would have enjoyed to hear Adele's commentary to go along with the tunes...  Excellent buy, and proud to have it in my collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this sequel was great, all my friends like it so i decided to try, and loved it too. just fun
B00AGKH6D8|4.0|It seems like any cd that has Joe Bonamassa on it I must have it. I have not studied the music yet but I'm sure it will be a success
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I completely agree that this book was stale, slow, and uneventful compared to the third books dramatic and fast paced twister of events.  But just like Clash of Kings this book is a filler for events and characters who are being moved into play for the sixth instalment of the series.  I believe that when that comes out, people will see the book differently and possibly appreciate it more.  Besides the comparison to the third book this book definitely is decent read and meaningful even though we cannot see it yet.
0988936410|4.0|So far I am about 47% through the book. I am in love with how right off the bat you get sucked into the world of Everville where you meet The Fron, Them and The Keepers. I love Owens character and how he just wants to do his best to help Everville as best as he can. I love the story. Great story telling from Mr. Huff. I cannot wait to finish the book and start on the next one (when its available of course)
1476719071|5.0|So when I started this book I was a little hesitant.  I had built it up so much in my head I was worried I wasn't going to like it.  I was sooooo relived when I instantly fell in love with it.  I truly loved this story, inside and out.  :)<br /><br />Travis Maddox.  Oh, Travis.  We all have our favorite bad boys, and Travis just jumped into my top five.  I loved him to pieces and hated him to the core all at the same time... it was amazing.  Abby was snarky and made silly choices at times, but I loved her too.  I know a lot of other reviews I've read really hate on Abby... but I thought she was very realistic, totally relatable, and because of all of that, she was likable to me.  She faced some pretty tough struggles in her childhood that she was running from... and I give her a lot of credit for taking the steps on her own to better her life.  And her BFF America was right there by her side.  This group was intense, strong and all true friends.  I really enjoyed them all.<br /><br />Emma did a great job as narrator.  As Abby, she was exactly how I pictured her.  The emotions and reactions were spot on.  At times I felt like her Travis was a little too wimpy for how I pictured him... but I guess Travis had to show his softer side sometimes.  ;)<br /><br />I would say if you haven't read this book yet, and you like new adult contemps even just a little bit, you should definitely read it.  I have Walking Disaster waiting patiently on my Kindle right now, and I will be reading it asap.  What a great book!
0064409422|5.0|The book was about 5 dollars under retail and it was perfect. The same copy I read as a little girl. My son is enjoying it now as a child. Thanks for allowing the lion the witch and the wardrobe continue on another generation at a reasonable price!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Although ive only used this on 2 of my knives so far, it did the job I wanted and did exactly what i needed it to do. I cannot speak yet for the life of  this product as of course I have only used it twice. Very simple to use though even for someone like me who had to read the instructions. I really needed a sharpener for a pocket knife I use all the time (no serrations just a straight blade) that was very dull after cutting up some cardboard. It sharpened this knife very well and thats all I could ask for. The sharpener does have a tool to sharpen serrations and other things like that but I have not used that yet as I just purchased another knife that hasnt needed sharpening yet. For the price its a great tool to have if you have even one knife you use as nothing is worse than a dull knife when you really need one!

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is my second Jillian DVD and I echo other reviews regarding the intensity of the workout in a 20 minute window - it is great.  I have never had knee problems and these workouts are very hard on the knees.  Even being careful with form, something went 'pop' doing simple jumping jacks a few days in!  Am sure the knee was stressed from unusual activity...<br /><br />Also, silly note, but:  This DVD has a menu at the beginning.  Our DVD player remote is long gone so I could not navigate to play the workout....ended up watching it in YouTube.
B0039PPW60|4.0|I love this mixer. It has worked flawlessly over the past two years in my DJ rack and I could not have asked for a better mixer. I wish the sound coming in from the USB had its own line on the panel. As it sits the USB line in is not adjustable. Thats why it only got 4/5 stars.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"Its real, Six. You can't get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. It's the fake happily ever after that should piss you off.\\"<br /><br />Summery:<br /><br />After spending many years being home schooled Sky is able to go to a public school only to find out that her best friend is going to a different school for a couple of months leaving her to fend for herself in a new school. Since her best friend seems to have a reputation her peers make assumptions and end up giving her a hard time.<br /><br />Dean Holder has a bit of a reputation himself and when he meets Sky he knows there is something familiar about her he just can't figure it out.<br /><br />After meeting Dean old memories of her past start to resurface, memories she didn't want coming back to her. Sky knows that Dean is hiding some and won't stop questioning him till he tells her what he knows. The secrets he seems to know will change her life forever revealing a past that was better left forgotten.<br /><br />\\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when t's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at. It's my favorite thing because I know if i ever get lost of lonely or scared, I just have to look up and it'll be there no matter what... and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I found this book beautiful, intense, uplifting, and heartbreaking. This book was well written, funny at times and also serious. This book is is about coping with a harsh tragedy?(I'm trying to find the word and couldn't think of anything but tragedy) and learning to find peace afterwards. When I was reading this book I found so much to highlight such great quote in this book, thank goodness for the kindle I would probably have a hard time reading a book as amazing as this and not be able to highlight some of the quotes  in it.<br /><br />This book has got me from start. While reading I instantly liked Sky and knew there was something about her that I knew wasn't right. I enjoyed reading how Sky's and Holder's relationship develops and see how her amazing first kiss that wasn't a kiss turn out.<br /><br />\\"Not everything is going to go my way and not everyone gets a happily ever after. Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend!ing how Sky's and Holder's relationship develops and see how her amazing first kiss that wasn't a kiss turn out.<br /><br />\\"Not everything is going to go my way and not everyone gets a happily ever after.

The book is a real story and is written very interesting and simple.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love playing this game. Even my two year old can play and have fun. We play together and we have so much fun she gets mad when we have to stop. The only thing that would make it better is if we could get money easier so we could up grade faster. Ohh and if the gold coins where not so hard to find or cost so much money.
B005LAII62|5.0|From the makers of &#34;Coraline&#34; comes another amazing feat in stop animation.  Watching the &#34;How They Made It&#34; featurette will really bring into focus how hard these people work.  The story itself is fun, dark and oddly endearing- any fans of Neil Gaiman's work will love it.  I also think the themes of bullying, prejudice and ignorance will hit home with anyone.  But if also shows the power of love, friendship, humor and standing up for what's right.  A very, very enjoyable movie for (almost) the whole family!  (Normally I'd say no younger than 6, but my 4 year old niece DID wander in and sit down and that kid not even blink when the zombies showed up.  All she said was &#34;Don't hide under the bed!  They'll find you- duh!&#34;  Ha!!)
B004XVN1T4|5.0|I loved reading this book and have become a big Ken Follett fan. I was really sorry to see this book end! I do an annual cycling trip (self supported) through Asia leaving the US in January when it's cold and come home end of April when it's warm. I always load up my Kindle with enough books to get me through the trip. I've about read all of the Ken Follett novels but found this one quite by mistake and downloaded it. I like his style of writing and the methodology he uses to weave characters and events. Cannot say enough about Ken Follett novels and he as a write. Highly recommend this book.

B00BESJYAY|4.0|The beautiful scenes of beaches and incredible waves were well done.  The story was inspirational for want to be surfers who love to surf.  The story was also well done depicting how the character of one boy-young man allowed his dream to come true regardless of his homelike, parental support and peer pressure.  Our family was surprised by the ending.  Nevertheless, a well done movie on surfing.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|Crank up the volume, warm up the pipes and let the music begin!  Sure to be a &#34;cult classic&#34;, this movie is just flat out fun.  Not the strongest story line ever written (seriously- why was the a story line with her radio station boss even IN the movie?), but a fun time nonetheless!  Mostly I found myself shouting &#34;shut up and sing!!&#34;  A Capella as a genre is brilliant because it truly shows that the quality of any song is in the arrangement.  (I mean, they made a Miley Cyrus song sound GOOD.  WHAT?)  I have watched this probably 4 times so far with various friends, and it just gets better each time.  The soundtrack is a fun ride too- check it out!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|So I recently just got a kindle and I got this game it is fun while getting the blades and backgrounds after getting all of them my big goal is to keep trying to get a higher &#34;highest score&#34; which keeps me busy! :D

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|So much happens this season, I can't even begin to say what it is without saying any spoilers. All I will say is this: There are many new exciting things that happen to Mary, Edith, Anna, Bates, Thomas, Lady and Lord Crawley and the rest of the gang that one will be left surprised unless they have seen it already when it was being shown on PBS in the States.
1567184855|4.0|This book is a nice read and corroborates the information from Dr. Weiss and others leading experts in the field.  I am a firm believer that death is not the end of active conscious existence.  We do not just die and end in a dormant state awaiting a resurrection, nor do we only live one lifetime and die with no hope as the popular worldly belief goes.  So every over indulgence is justified by saying:  &#34;We only live once&#34;, therefore we may as well live it up and have fun.  I am however skeptical of some of the inferences made by Dr. Newton.  He does not just stick to the facts, but also makes many speculative guesses based on his subjects answers to his probing questions.  The times when he does not receive a satisfactory answer, the blame is always leveled on the soul's overseer that is assumed as blocking thought transmissions.  I feel he has pushed the reincarnation knowledge very far ahead without enough evidence to support some of his conclusions.  There is alot more research needed in this field and I hope that those reading his book realize that many of his conjectures need further study before we can give it full creedence.  Otherwise this book is well worth the time to read with an open mind.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a wonderful app to have.... if you are looking for an alarm clock this is great quality... if you have the first edition called alarm clock I would strongly recommend the upgrade...
B008LH4YYC|3.0|but it does it really slowly. My Kindle Fire HD is brand new so it hasn't had time to be slowed down much by a lot of downloads. This app will kill tasks as promised, and it does it quickly and easily. Just push a button, POOF, done. However, clearing the cache is a bit of a pain. It worked great for weeks then all of a sudden, it began taking a long time to load the cache info. Like, 5 minutes long before I can even see how much I have to delete. It just keeps saying \\"Loading....\\". Sometimes I walk away and grab a snack and come back to \\"Loading...\\". Another snack, \\"Loading...\\" My waistline can't afford to keep using this app. Trying to find a suitable alternative.<br />Kimberly
B0054X3FQO|5.0|Very uplifting, great to keep as a daily reminder to stay positive and not let the little things get you down.
B005GIS23I|4.0|This was a fun show to watch...but the language was really unnecessary.  The anti-christian/anti-god bit was a little over the top as well, but not unexpected out of this duo.  Key to this one...realize it is there and just have fun with it.  It's only a movie.
1250012570|5.0|Short and Sweet:<br />A sometimes sweet, sometimes painful story about first love between two 'real' and quirky characters. Eleanor and Park contains many complex elements, including the power of a person's inside qualities to transform their outside attractiveness. This is high school love in all of its awkwardness and anxiety.<br /><br />To Elaborate....<br />Guys, I have to tell you that this one is outside of what I normally read. I don't often read realistic fiction, but I'm really glad I gave Eleanor & Park a chance. Both of these characters reminded me of how it truly is in high school. It is 'I wish I didn't have to take the bus home with those jerks' awful at times. It is surviving the mean kids and if you're lucky finding someone who is cool with you being 'you.'<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell didn't write pretty characters here. He wrote human, flawed, naive, and sometimes startlingly wise characters. As far as family life, we see both ends of the spectrum here. Eleanor's is broken and full of anxiety and ugliness. Park, however, has a supportive home. This comes into play in the end of the book in a really beautifully heartbreaking way.<br /><br />Just a really solid book. I hope they make this into a movie. Reminded me a a little of the quirky, heartfelt tone of the movie Juno. I really, really liked this one. :)

B006GECE9Y|3.0|But it's the only Android browser I can download for the Micro Cruz.  The browser that came with the unit kicks me out of about every other website.  Anything affiliated with Google.  Because of some algorithm problem.  Which, since Velocity has moved on to more sophisticated tablets, they have no intention of resolving in the Micro Cruz.  You see, this little tablet is kinda android and kinda not.  I wanted the Foxfire, the Opera, and the Chrome but no go.  BUT ...I love the Velocity Micro Cruz.  For $50, it's all most people will ever need.  More on that when I actually review the Velocity Micro Cruz.

B00AHDXTIK|1.0|This thing is beefy. Love the extended lightning plug end, very easy to install and remove. Really has a quality feel and properly charges all of our iDevices, up to and including the latest generation iPads.<br /><br />12/23/2013 Edit! Buyer beware. Just bought my second one of these. The first one (reviewed above) has been working fine for many, many months now, the one I just received doesn't work at all and, sure enough, iPod is misspelled on the packaging. Another reviewer noticed this or else I wouldn't have. The packaging is that good of a fake. Just returned from Best Buy to look at how those are labeled, and yes, iPod is spelled correctly.<br /><br />So, the ones being sold through Amazon by \\"Quality Choices\\" are fakes. Avoid at all costs.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|it was a gift, the 3 dvd set was amazing, it was a good price, prompt delivery. not complaints. it is a dvd.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I must admit a preference for this genre so when the review were mixed my hopes plummeted.  I decided to give it a chance and I am really glad I have!  When movies try to take on comic books most of the time the results are over the top effects with little to no character depth and growth.  With this being a series, the characters develop more thoroughly and are shown struggling with issues that span the season so you understand the characters and like them a lot more than perhaps some movie counterparts.<br />I concur with another reviewer who commented this is a darker series and if the viewer is hoping to see lighter moments and witty banter this is not the show for you.

B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Honestly?  That doesn't matter!  It also screams &#34;It's the '70's,&#34; which was when it came out, but that doesn't matter either!<br /><br />Logan's Run is an excellent telling about the price of living in one particular Eutopia, and if the thread that's the price of living there (which you didn't have a choice in, hence, dissidence,) is pulled, then it's a whole, brand new world.  But in any event, the old one will be gone for good.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it for you.  There are other reviews if you want to know who's involved and what happens.  But this one sets you to thinking.  Aside from Star Wars (which this film was unlucky enough to precede by less than a year,) I can't think of that many 70's sci-fi flicks that are still around, let alone went on to put on DVD, and let alone for as low budget as sci-fi was made for the time this was released.  (I think all the production money must have gone to convincing Michael York to play.  ;-)  I noticed that his career was another victim of Star Wars.)

Don't get me wrong, EVERYONE in this movie is great, but NOBODY else could have played the leading role.  One of my favorites of all time.  Watch this movie and you will NOT be disappointed!
B001TH16DI|5.0|All-time favorite movie series.<br /><br />What a wonderful idea! All six original cast movies on Blu-Ray. Great series and a great price.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Excellent movie with recognized cast and a great story line, it is funny, original, and it would make you enjoy yourself. Highly recommended!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. However, the delivery via Amazon streaming was poor. It kept buffering in key moments in the movie. This has happened before. It does not happen with Netflix or Charter on Demand.
B0082SU98U|4.0|This simple little story caused me to think about my attitude each day. Do I only see the negative in life, or am I happy for what God has given me. A sweet story that makes you happy.
B007M45PMU|4.0|This is my first exposure to the Lumineers, and I really enjoyed most of this album.<br />It was worth my money to get it.
B001I45UFC|5.0|As a Christian minister I see more in this than just a great story for children, but in that latter respect it stands on its own.  I've long been a fan of short works...and this is a book that is attainable in a relatively small period of time.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|Movie was blurred  wanted the DVD..ordered the digital by mistake.<br />Would like the DVD instead of the digital.  What do i need to do to switch this.<br />Thanks.
0316228532|5.0|With The Casual Vacancy, J. K. Rowling has proven that not only can she give voice to The Boy Who Lived, but also to the myriad denizens of Pagford. Rowling deftly weaves between characters, helping the reader understand their usually misguided and often malevolent actions. I greatly enjoyed this book, even though it was strange reading some of the mildly graphic descriptions and vulgar dialogue. These are not two things that normally upset me, but as a long-time Harry Potter fan, it was strange to read them from the woman who wrote the books that I grew up with. If you enjoyed the narration style of the Harry Potter books, or you like small town politics, I strongly recommend this book. If you were mainly a fan of the content of the HP books, you may be disappointed.
B007SGM084|2.0|I read the &#34;Fifty Shades Trilogy&#34; and kept waiting for the characters to develop, where I at least cared for them, it never did; the plot was also very thin and weak. There were parts in the story-line that were so repetitive, that it became boring. The sex scenes were also repetitive and boring and I would skip over them in search of a story or a reason to care about the characters...they were the only things in this story not to come.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Great story and acting.  Everyone of the actors are perfect for their roles.  Picture is great, as is sound.  I'd forgotten how much I love a great romantic story.  Hell, I started crying about one-third of the way into this flick and was completely in tears by the end.  Great romantic flicks don't come this way very often.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent story…can't help but root for Pat…and in the end, it turns out fantastic and low key…just so very endearing
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run is a game to play to past the time or to just have fun! I think it is much better then temple run the original
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is a lot . Of fun for me and I'm ten so yay it is a lot of fun and the good thing is that it is free
B004G606K8|5.0|I look forward to sharing this series with my own child, and watching her imagination spark as the story unfolds.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album along with his previous ones, does not disappoint. It has something on it for everyone, a little r&b, a few ballads, a little Latin flair, a little new age, and a whole lotta soul. It seems like each album improves and I can't wait for the next one to come out in September!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this games is very cool I love it so much it makes me wish I had my own horse. I love it!!!
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I love this album. From start to finish it's a flawless album. Every song is fantastic, and i never skip over any of them. My only regret with this album is I didn't discover it sooner.

B00AW0KHMY|5.0|This has both the original movie and the extended edition! There is extra footage at the beginning of the movie and while they are on their honeymoon! Also some little extras added throughout!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this album and there's nothing i regret about buying it. I love it. Definitely in my top 5 favorite albums of all time. If you buy it you won't be disappointed.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very fun and entertaining with lots of puzzles and riddles. Kept me and my wife entertained for hours. Looking forward to many more sequels.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I loved this movie. The main charactor in the movie is Robert Patinson. He is such a great actor. This is the fourth movie in the Twilight Saga. There is constant action in the movie so it keeps you on the front of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves movies with a lot of action and a differnt kind of love story.
0545265355|5.0|Bought these for a friend! The case they came in was great and the books were all a good size. Easy to read the font size!

160094048X|5.0|I am in love with this cookbook!    Although I'm not vegan, I enjoy these recipes 1) because they are interesting, flavorful, and creative, 2)you never have to worry about if you have enough eggs, butter, etc, and 3) they just taste so good!    I live in high altitude and find that these recipes work surprisingly well at high elevations with little or no modifications.    The downsides are: 1) the cookbook will require some obscure ingredients at times, but once you outfit your pantry with a few vegan baking staples, its not much of an issue. 2) Many recipes call for too much oil, or at least more than I'm willing to put in.  I cut down the oil quantities by 1/4 to 1/2 of the amount in the recipes and enjoy a mildly healthier cookie.    I highly recommend this cookbook!  I love making these cookies, bringing them to work, and sneaking in the comment, when their mouth is full and they're enjoying the cookie, \\"Oh, did I mention they are vegan?\\"  Lots of fun!  I also recommend checking out the author's blog: \\"The Post Punk Kitchen\\" [...]
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I would recommend all the books by Lee Childs with Jack Reacher.  If you saw the Tom Cruise movie  &#34;Reacher&#34; I would warn you that Jack is 6'2&#34; tall and 225lbs.  Could cause you a visual disconnect.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|While I'm not happy about Firefly not being continued and this movie wasn't what I would've chosen for an ending for the Firefly series, it still is a good movie. Not going to the theater good, but good enough to own at home.
B008M87GJK|5.0|The app makes reading material, and navigating the BBC an enriched experience.<br />It far more user friendly, than visiting the websites.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This was a nice feel good movie.  The story was enjoyable and I would watch it again. Made me smile.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This came in good shape and in a timely manner.  I haven't watched it yet, but if you like the movie I am thinking you will like the show.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Movie was fast moving and kept me interested.  Showed we suffer results from our choices even if the outcome was positive.
B0016CXCTC|1.0|When this album was first released I decided to take a wait and see attitude. after hearing the brilliant 'Omega' and 'XXX. I thought this would be a worthwhile purchase. Boy was I wrong. Heralded as a 'triumphant return' this comes of as the worst attempt at 80's pop ever.Several of the albums with John Payne actually dwarf this sadly misguided effort. Glad Asia are back in form but they are out of shape here.
0439023513|1.0|I wish there was some way for me to get the several hours I spent reading this book back, it was just a boring, sad pathetic attempt to finish what started out as a wonderful trilogy without putting too much effort into it. Hunger Games was outstanding, and Catching Fire had much to recommend it. This book had none of that. By the end, I just really wanted Katniss to climb a tree, a tall building or some other tall structure and thankfully end it all. I thoroughly hated her by halfway through this book, and couldn't have cared less what happened to her. Do something stupid. Get hurt. Be in the hospital. Whine a lot. be drugged and dream horrible dreams. Repeat, ad nauseum. I am a parent of a war vet, and anyone who thinks this is an accurate portrayal of PTSD is sadly mistaken.
B00BF11STU|4.0|It was a great story but too much of the story was told in scenes that were too dark to see anything.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have recently discovered Gillian Flynn and the twists in this tale live up to her writing style.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great read with plenty of well written turns!
B000SEI230|5.0|This book is amazing! My favorite book so far! It's so sweet and I finished this book in one day I couldn't stop!
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Opens with Ravi sitar music - excellent choice. Eric Clapton did a great job assembling the musicians who play on the most appropriate George songs. I have a feeling he was able to work some of Georges recorded guitar in some of the songs. JeffLynne, Tom Petty, Paul, and Ringo are all fantastic. It's one of the best things I have purchased on this site. --- Rich

B00A0SKFLG|4.0|The action was here in this movie but I found the plot a little wanting.  Worth the rental but prepare to be underwhelmed.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|What a great idea surrounding the behind-the-scenes lives of arcade game characters. John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman make the characters loveable and real, or maybe just really loveable, and the animation is so fun!

1607066017|5.0|I'm not reviewing this comic, because I'm not a super Comic geek and don't know a lot about comics. I will say it's well written and is one of the best comics out right now I am reading. I know it's one of the most favored in the comic community. This came in mint condition. I received it in a timely manner.

B000M5AJQI|5.0|This is a remake of the original Infernal Affairs. It basically takes the original's novel plot and puts an American spin on it.<br /><br />I found it more enjoyable than the original. The original is fine, but this one doesn't take itself too seriously and is more fun as a result. Jack Nicholson is delightfully devilish, while Alec Baldwin brings in some 30 Rock to the show. It actually takes some inspiration from the real life Whitey Bulger as well as the FBI agent who was his \\"man on the inside.\\"<br /><br />Recommended.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was nowhere near as good as the book but it was fine. Really looking forward to the next movie and hoping it meets our expectations a little better...we'll see.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm going to be honest, at first I didn't want to read it. I thought this was just going to be another Logan's Run, which I love, but I've read a lot of books like those. I would recommend these three books to anyone!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We went to the movies and seen this  and couldn't wait for it to be released on DVD. This is a type of movie you can watch again and again and also have a question and answer time with your kids afterwards.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I actually lambasted my friend for buying this when it came out because what I had heard so far didn't grab me at all. Low and behold, once I had heard it a number of times and let it sink in I slowly came around. In fact, at this point I consider it the finest album they have produced in a number of years. I can't really compare it to any previous album because it has its own, fully cohesive sound without erasing the overall unique sound DM has. If you are into DM for nostalgia but don't really love the genre they hail from then it may not be to your liking. If you are a fan of the band and overall genre then it should be right up your alley. It does take time to sink in though, which is a tall order for present day slice and dice, passive ipod listeners.<br /><br />Key tracks for me were<br /><br />Heaven<br />Secret To The End<br />Should Be Higher<br />Alone<br />Goodbye

0321356683|5.0|Absolutely the best book on Java I have ever come across. Everything I hoped for from one of Java's creators. A slow, careful reading interspersed with plenty of time for reflection is the best way to read Effective Java.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another good book about Jack None Reacher. The story line kept you moving along but some of the gun battles are a little too Hollywood
B00428LIXO|5.0|This toy reminds me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit or Disney's Toon Town - it is very cute and makes adorable noises when hit. The colors are nice and the faces on the hammer ends are cheerful. I bought this for a long road-trip - every time my son started to really lose it, I produced a new small toy for him to explore. Five toys later we had survived a 12 hour road-trip! This was one of my son's favorites and I definitely recommend it!
1400069181|4.0|This is the story of TOMS shoes, and how he donates a pair of shoes for each pair of shoes he sells. As a result, he creates a good life for himself and his employees, and does a huge amount of good for others in the world. I found the book to be refreshing, and motivating. Our current business model that says that you must increase the ROI by X amount a year, always growing, no matter what, needs a huge overhaul. That old model taught by business schools is why we outsources most of our jobs, production, etc. to India and China. It is time to read this little book, and think of a way to create a better world- a world where jobs matter, and where doing good for others who have little really matters. And it feels really good to run a business with compassion and care.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Oh what a twist!!! I feel for peeta. I still have hope for him and katniss. I can't wait to start book three!

1451648537|5.0|This is such a great book! You feel like you know something about many of the facets that made up Steve Jobs after reading the book.

B00BS7G1H0|5.0|There's a fine line between familiarity and understanding.  None know this better than fans of Mike Patton, whose work lends a sense of incredulity regardless of the projects of which he's a part.  Best known for having been a frontman of the band Faith No More, considered by many to be the progenitor of the rap metal (or nu-metal) subgenre, Patton's continued and furthermore developed his craft in niche-market bands like Mr. Bungle, Fantômas, and most recently the Native American-leaning Tomahawk, never reluctant to vary his instrumental interests or zany vocal savvy.  A genius to some and a pure nutcase to others, Patton's prolific nature and incredible talent is impossible to deny.  But a rare occurrence, even for Patton's catalog, is the scoring of a film, for which The Place Beyond the Pines writer/director Derek Cianfrance hired him in 2012.  A longtime fan of Patton's, Cianfrance had always hoped he'd had a chance to work with the musical visionary, and capitalized upon it to score the film he'd written after 2010's Blue Valentine.<br /><br />Not knowing what to expect is perhaps the best quality of Mike Patton's music.  Be it psychotic vocal tendencies, mixed musicianship, or uncharacteristic structure, Patton's execution always thrusts forth confusion along with an easily identifiable recognition of buried genius, and his score for The Place Beyond the Pines is no exception.  Patton is only responsible for half of the album, however, whereas the latter half is filled with no less effective songs from artists originating hundreds of years into the past.  But whereas most scores whose songs are seen as muted counterparts to the titular composer's music, The Place Beyond the Pines wraps both Patton's music as well as the other eclectic selections into a strongly cohesive, monumental album that will leave the listener mentally and emotionally drained.<br /><br />Patton's creations begin with \\"Schenectady,\\" an immediately oppressive track whose soft, beautiful, female choral chanting backed by almost detuned string work and carefully picked electric guitar most definitely reflect Cliff Martinez's Contagion.  In spite of the leadoff track's melody and awestruck fairness, Patton establishes a groundwork of hapless emotional implosion that flows forward with the entire album.  This feeling branches into \\"Family Trees,\\" whose angelic choir continues at a higher octave while ushering in a sense of calming beauty, before slightly reverberated electric guitar and low-octave piano begin to steer the track's sound into a threatening din.  \\"Bromance,\\" an early favorite, reintroduces the casual, almost telltale motes of guitar from the first track before a gentle piano-driven version of its theme is keyed over short issues of strings, bringing to mind the horrifying beauty of Akira Yamaoka's \\"Forest\\" from Silent Hill 2.  A harpsichord-like melody permeates \\"Forest of Conscience\\" before developing into a jarring but somehow soothing synth backdrop, with slow waves of organic and seemingly electronic piano wash in along with loops of sound effects mocking the chirps of crickets.<br /><br />\\"Beyond the Pines\\" is built solely upon female choral vocals, but later incorporates loops of twinkling guitar melodies prefacing the return of the main Pines theme.  The cold contents of \\"Misremembering\\" follow, splaying out echoing single notes of hollowed bass upon skittish layers of string work, before producing chords of acoustic guitar tracing a pattern of short synth bursts and coils of strings.  \\"Sonday\\" is irrefutably potent, with its emotive and depressing cello passages somehow hollowed out and topped with strangely resonating bells and chimes, producing a scathing track that writhes within the listener's psyche like a mental virus.  \\"The Snow Angel\\" soon presents a window to a robust instrumental meeting of low- and high-octave piano before folding in alien electronic effects and staccato-like slices of reverb, and \\"Handsome Luke\\" acts as a filtered punch in the gut with its electric guitar, female chants, and painful reverb effects toppling over a roiling, staggering, and fiercely affecting din, bringing to mind similar musical cacophony of the more forceful moments from Mark Snow's The X-Files.<br /><br />With The Cryin' Shames' 1966 hit \\"Please Stay,\\" a Burt Bacarach cover, Patton's compositional work comes to an end but still manages to influence the remainder of the score's contemporary musical selections.  \\"Please Stay\\" therefore feels profusely deep in spite of its simplicity, as the sharp juxtaposition of its docile nature really drives a cavernous, empty resonance to the listener.  The 17th century Renaissance composition \\"Miserere Mei\\" follows, but is a 1998 interpretation of the Allegri classic by Russian composer Vladimir Ivanoff; its utterly beautiful male and female chanting and sorrowful horns bring a classical and deeply chilling vibe to the album.  Estonian composer Arvo P&auml;rt's \\"Fratres for Strings and Percussion\\" then enters, a track of orchestral minimalism that exemplifies the more silent and ambient work on James Newton Howard's The Village while adding a certain dose of reluctant charm and a cloak of charisma.  In a strange twist, but keeping with the enigmatic feel of the Pines album, Ennio Morricone's \\"Ninna Nanna Per Adulteri\\" is thrown in unapologetically, with its clockwork-like twitches of bells and chimes dancing with an oddly-repeating female vocal melody.  American indie folk artist Bon Iver caps the soundtrack with \\"The Wolves (Act I and II),\\" an immensely powerful track that drives home the reticent solace implied by the score's profound beauty, as singer Justin Vernon's high-octave vocals reflect nostalgia and joy delivered through passages of deeply touching folk structure.<br /><br />The music presented on The Place Beyond the Pines is ridiculously powerful, be it the score from Mike Patton or the other song selections that at least on paper might seem unexpected.  Words simply don't do the score or soundtrack justice, as it robs the listener of conflict, instills emptiness and depression, and stabs with shards of hope in its wake.

B004EPZ06G|2.0|The Hangover Part II for whatever reason, is *not* funny like the first one is.  This is 100% proof that if you try to recreate what made the original so great without putting any writing effort into making the sequel funny or interesting and basically just copy what's already been done, the results will completely fall flat.<br /><br />The Hangover Part II is a colossal disappointment.  One missed attempt at humor after another, including an adorable but unfunny and overused monkey, and the search for a friend that's eventually found in a location not *nearly* as compelling or interesting as in the first film.  Plus an overall noticeable rushed feeling to the writing that eventually severely hurts this one.  Let's not even mention the overbearing nude scenes that only spark a reaction of unbelievable shock and feeling grossed out.<br /><br />A movie that easily could've been exciting had the writing not been so darn unforgivably weak.  Obviously an attempt to cash in on the brief Hangover craze a couple years ago, this movie isn't worth recommdending.
B008602KQI|3.0|For adults who are indifferent to trendy books and movies - I write this review to let you know this is a decent film. The violence is  intentional and serves the plot. The themes are akin to the anti-Totalitarian tales you read in high school with some Dungeons & Dragons/reality show connventions exploited to give the fight against opression a modern twist. Watchable, but not life-changingly powerful.

B001TH16DI|4.0|The first two films that I have watched are really nice transfers and I am very pleased. I'm not in it for the content so much (who hasn't seen these films a hundred times each at this point - well I mean II through V) The Captains Summit disc is really nice, I enjoyed that discussion very much. So far, a nice boxed set of the original series films.<br /><br />I apparently got a bad disc III though. Star Trek III - The Search for Spock doesn't work in my (brand new) Sony Blu-ray player. I'm hoping for an easier solution than returning the whole set for a new one, The disc doesn't appear damaged so I don't know what the problem would be.<br /><br />Gave 4 starts for meets expectations, with the exception of the bad third disc. Amazon what's the easiest method for getting customer support on a single disc problem like this?
B009AMANH4|5.0|The movie makes you feel like you where there. It also shows that politics were even more heated back then.

B000002KB8|5.0|This is their first album and the album that brought a new hard dark sound to rock, Ilove Sabbath, they are great and this is a GREAT album. LONG LIVE SABBATH.
B002GHHHPQ|3.0|For anyone who is into aviation history, or World War II, this is a very entertaining film with great aerial combat and some of the best footage of B-17's ever filmed.  It also does a great job of showing the dangers of the 8th Airforce's daylight bombing raids and just how tough the Flying Fortress was as an aircraft.  Having said that though the historical accuracy of the plot leaves a lot to be desired.  Yes there really is a B-17 named Memphis Belle (she's currently under restoration), and yes it's crew was celebrated as the first to complete their tour of duty.  In real life the Memphis Belle's 25th and final mission was far less dramatic.  The real crew actually flew 29 missions, 25 of which were in the Belle, and their final mission was over Kiel, not Bremen.  Additionally the characters in the movie are just composites of various arch-types, and bare no resemblance to their real life counterparts (even the names are different).<br /><br />I'd give the movie four stars, but my DVD has subtitles that cannot be turned off.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I'm a big fan of the tv show and while reading this book I could just see the characters and the environments.  Great read.
B007N31ZKQ|5.0|Again, my DVD player's software isn't updated for Blue Ray, for this movie, but luckily it had a regular version included so I was able to properly celebrate the Big Lebowsi's 25th anniversay.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finally, the answers to all the questions that build in your head while reading the first two books of this trilogy, even through most of this final book!  Each book keeps one coming back to find out what happens to Katniss, the girl on fire. However,  I wish the story had not been broken up into three books. That was to me, very frustrating.  But the author did find a way to make you want to go on to the next book. Some of the storyline from Catching Fire & Mockingjay could have been combined.  Sorry to see they're doing the same thing with the movies, but then that just makes more money fire everyone concerned.  I just recently saw The Hunger Games for the first time. If I hadn't read the books, I really don't think I'd want to see the sequel.

B0083SBJXS|4.0|A Critical Look at Marvel's, The Avengers<br /> Well, that successfully, enthusiastic partnership of Marvel and Disney have done it again--creating, yet, another delightful installment to their series of Marvel tributes. We have learned to expect, from this team, a certain quality of showmanship and audience satisfaction.  Yet, at times, we are left with a sense of want in the area of epic suspense (i.e., a greater emphasis towards the character/audience bond; often found in earlier classics, such as, Spartacus and Ben Hur). Although, when compared to DC's franchise of comic book movies, Marvel studios seem to be in the business of creating Hollywood masterpieces, in the line of Gone with the Wind and Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments.<br /> Marvel's, The Avengers is a smorgasbord of well-known and beloved characters all coming together to meet a common goal. Of course this common goal is the same goal of every comic book movie, trying to save the world from the antagonist that has threatened all with world cataclysm. Joss Whedon's avenging creation doesn't disappoint, with the eclectic cast of characters, from Robert Downey jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, and Chris Evans as Captain America, the characters are all well cast, as they are in their character's original Marvel motion picture baseline. Although The Avengers doesn't give an in-depth look into the history of each character, it doesn't shy away from detail to draw you in to the story. Running a full 2 ½ hours this movie doesn't feel like it's over as soon as you sat down to watch it, at the same time you don't find yourself continuously checking your watch either. I would highly recommend being well versed in the particular Marvel characters and their back stories before sitting down to watch The Avengers, as this movie is based around Thor's brother Loki, and his attempt to take over the Earth. Without a solid foundation of these characters, the reasons why Loki is back after being defeated in Thor, is not very clear. This movie is written in a way that expects the audience to be familiar with each one of these well-known and favored characters and it does not take the time to teach and instruct the viewers the details of these characters lives, (as the movie could have ended up a good six hours). So if you're in a situation of familiarity of the characters and their stories, prepare to be drawn in to an action packed, thrill ride, alongside your familiar Marvel characters, interlaced with humor and suspense. Marvel comics have always superseded DC comics, by way of humor and real life situations (retaining a sense of realism while at the same time creating a world of sci-fi and fantasy); opposed to DC's campy, unproportionate silliness, (DC constantly attempting to increase the darkness of its characters in hopes of holding an appeal to the masses). Along with that, the situational humor, accompanied by its while timed delivery of quips (this is where Downey's Iron Man shines), is surely in line with Marvel's preceding \\"Origins\\" movies that have blown up at the box office in the previous seasons.<br /> With its sci-fi epic storyline and all-star cast, it's no wonder that The Avengers has ended up the third highest grossing film of all-time. Although we are always able to find areas of improvement and personal suggestions after seeing almost any motion picture, Joss Whedon's creation of The Avengers is certainly a movie I will see again.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|Since my husband died I have struggled to sleep.  Leaving the tv on helped sometimes but at others was just an irritant.  I can alter this to fit my moods and the volume for lighter needs days.  Love the variety of sounds.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I saw in 2012 (and really, one of the best I've ever seen!) There was so much thought and detail put in to developing the characters in this film; I felt as if I knew a little bit of a background about each one of them while the story progressed. All of the actors were amazing and perfectly cast for the roles they played in this exciting, funny, shoot-em-up tale of freedom, friendship, and vengence.<br /><br />Right off the bat I feel as though Django and Dr. Shultz connected and worked very well with each other. Waltz was very cheeky and funny throughout, and Jaime Foxx played the character of a vengeful and brave slave very well. As the movie progressed you could see a strong bond beginning to form between the two characters, which I loved to watch unfold.<br /><br />And even though the overall undertone of this film is meant to be serious, there were so many parts that I found myself cracking up. Quentin did a very good job at meshing everything together in terms of storyline and humor. (The part with the men in hoods made us laugh so hard in the movie theater that my eyes were watering).<br /><br />Don't listen to the bad reviews of this film!! Everyone is making a huge deal about how this movie promotes racism, but c'mon people, the movie is about slavery! Of course there's going to be a main character who is black that finds joy in killing white people, you know, the race of people who have beat him and enslaved him for his entire life... Even though I realize where some people would find the content of this movie offensive, I just find it ridiculous that anyone would even make the racism a valid argument. And despite Django being glad to kill white people in this movie, we also see him freed by a white man, and become his very good friend.<br /><br />So overall I found this movie very entertaining, funny, and cringe-worthy. It is filled with drama and plenty of gorey shoot-out scenes for those who are into that sort of thing. If you're looking for a movie that strays from the norm of today's films, this is the one for you! Very unique and worth the three hour run time.ing.

B000PKX2KA|1.0|Don't buy this if your host PC uses Windows 7. I purchased this from Mp3Car Store to map out my offroad trips to my Windows 7 (64-bit) laptop and only causes Blue Screen of Death crashes.<br /><br />As soon as I load Google Earth to map in GPS> Real Time, I get a blue screen of death. I tried using the drivers that come on the CD. Tried uninstalling them, and then let Windows search for the correct drivers, but it still caused my computer to crash. I tried some of the other suggested fixes via Device Manager, such as switching the flow to hardware and reducing the receive and transmit buffers to 1, but my laptop still crashed and I get an DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL BSOD computer crash. After Googling around, it seems this is a common issue with GlobalSat Bu-353 devices (Google: GlobalSat Bu-353 Windows 7), where you will come across hundreds of threads about how their drivers aren't compatible with Vista/Windows 7. I wish I would of known that this device was not compatible with Windows 7 and Google Earth before purchasing. Now I'm out $25. Buyers beware!

B000X1T7MS|5.0|The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam is $9.99 for the kindle. This book was published in 2005. That's before we elected a Muslim president. It's too bad the electorate didn't read this book before the 2008 election. Sadly, American's awareness of what Islam really means hasn't improved one bit since this book was published.<br /><br />Islam is not just about religion. Islam is religion and politics all rolled into one dogma, and that dogma is focused on nothing less than world domination. That sounds pretty simplistic, but read this book, and get some understanding of what Islam means from the perspective of the Qur'an. If you can still sleep peacefully at night, you weren't paying attention.<br /><br />This book is a hard hitting, clear description of what Islam has accomplished through the ages. The descriptions of the crusades, and the Muslim conquests that preceded them, make it clear that it's not Christians, Jews, or any other group that persecute Muslims. It's the other way around. True Muslims don't consider any other people to be their equal. All of humanity is divided into Muslims and unbelievers, and unbelievers don't count for much except to pay taxes to Muslims or be slaves. The Qur'an endorses lying to, breaking promises to, and killing non-believers. It's only a sin to lie and cheat and kill other Muslims. This is a scary book, but very well documented and completely believable. Very highly recommended.

She talks about experiments , but explains about it in one page and not telling \\"What you me want me to do\\"?.<br /><br />Her writing style is the worst I have ever seen, and very very short on \\"technique\\".  Avoid this book at all cost.

B00BM9WM2C|4.0|A pleasent surprise...  I was worried about this album and what direction BJ would take it.  You never can tell because he likes to go in experimental directions suddenly sometimes.  However overall the album has much more of an old school BJ Rock vibe that I havent heard too much of since the Have a Nice Day album.  I think the What about Now album is definitely quality and well put together and Jon and the crew seem to be as sharp as ever.  I even thought the Sambora bonus track was pretty decent.  It usually takes me about 4-5 listens before I can give a thumbs up or down but I liked this album on the first listen which doesnt happen so much for me nowadays..  If your a BJ fan definitely give it a shot even if you havent liked the last couple albums!

B00817ZRRU|4.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" sounds more like a kung-fu movie than a Swedish thriller.<br /><br />But a Swedish thriller it is. And while posthumous debuts rarely get the attention they deserve -- or any attention, really -- the first novel of the late Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy starts slow, and slowly winds itself up into a tight knot of unique mystery and thriller elements. Just give it a few chapters to unfold.<br /><br />Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive named Wennerstr&ouml;m. Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece. She vanished forty years ago from the family's isolated island, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found.<br /><br />It's a pretty cold case, and not a very inviting one. But when Vanger offers Mikael rewards he cannot refuse -- evidence on the villainous Wennerstr&ouml;m -- he finds himself facing the bizarre, sinister Vanger family with few leads to go on. Then he meets Lisbeth Salander, an eccentric, abused computer hacker who serves as his counterpoint. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.<br /><br />Posthumous debuts are a rarity -- publishers always want a series, sequels, publicity signings, and books headed by \\"By the Author Of...\\" You don't get any of that if the person is dead. So it's a sign of how amazing \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is that Larsson's uniquely mystery-thriller has received such attention across the world.<br /><br />And Larsson's book is a unique blend of old and new -- he takes the Agatha Christie aesthetic of a locked-room murder with a dozen suspects, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"<br /><br />And though his prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, a certain brand of understated passion shines through Larsson's thriller story. It's the kind that feels the need to express itself even though it takes place in fiction. The only problem with the book is that Larsson pays undue attention to the whole Mikael-against-the-exec story. Not interesting, compared to the mystery.<br /><br />But Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple -- he's so world-weary and demoralized that he seems to care about nothing, while Salander is a mass of hurts and quirks. While she sometimes seems cartoonish, she's also a vibrant little character with enough strength and power to lash back at attackers. The supporting characters are far darker fare, including a loopy Nazi weirdo.<br /><br />Take the works of Agatha Christie and smother them in a disillusioned, morally-bankrupt noir world -- and you'll have something like \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\" A hard read, but leaves you wondering what the next two books have in store.hed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"<br /><br />And though his prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, a certain brand of understated passion shines through Larsson's thriller story.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I play a lot of games ranging from flight sims to strategy/resource to MMOGs.  I bought this gameboard because I was developing wrist pain from using the numberpad and arrow-key array on my keyboard.  Instant cure.  The G13 has an ergonomic sloped handrest that your carpel tunnel will appreciate.<br /><br />My wrist problem solved, I began to experiment with the G13 and was delighted to discover that I could easily program it to let me use the same keys for similar functions in each game.  No more ALT+S or CTRL+ALT+X.  The G13 allows you to  easily program multi-key commands so that they can be assigned to a single key on the G13.  The Gameboard also automatically recognizes a game and automatically switches to the configuration you set for that game.  It is very easy to use, and you're a gamer you will figure it out in three minutes without cracking the manual.

B0090XJJTQ|4.0|Like everyone else in the world, I instantly went cross-eyed at the idea of Guy Ritchie making a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br /><br />Sure enough, this is not your dad's Sherlock. Or your grandpa's either. \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is a thoroughly eccentric take on the legendary detective -- energetic, action-packed and clever, with more than a hint of steampunk and black magic. It gets kind of silly at times, but Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law keep the story going strong.<br /><br />As the story opens, a young woman is about to be sacrificed in a black magic ritual by the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). However, Sherlock Holmes (Downey) and Watson (Law) thwart him just in time for the police to arrive. Three months later, Blackwood is executed -- but not before he tells Holmes that three more people will die, and the world will change.<br /><br />But then his tomb is broken open... from the inside. And at the same time, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) tries to hire Holmes to track down a man who is then found dead in Blackwood's tomb. As Holmes tries to unravel this case, he discovers the existence of a strange upper-crust magical cult, who are slowly being killed off by Blackwood's mysterious powers. Has Sherlock Holmes run up against supernatural forces he cannot explain or fight?<br /><br />This is not an adaptation of one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories -- this is more a movie that takes the IDEA of Sherlock Holmes and applies it to a big, bombastic, quirky action movie. Ritchie directs the movie with a sharp, kinetic style, and he keeps things from getting too stuffy with lots of fight scenes (including Holmes mapping out every fight in his head before throwing a punch).<br /><br />His steampunky vision of London has a lot of dark, dripping corners, and Ritchie happily trots Sherlock and Watson down into them -- river boats, Parliament's basement, and grimy rituals down in some catacombs. The movie's biggest problem is that the action sometimes gets silly, such as the massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.<br /><br />But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (\\"No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!\\"). This is definitely a movie that loves Holmes at his most eccentric.<br /><br />The main reason this works so well is because of Downey. He is probably one of the best actors of our age, and he gives Sherlock a bright-eyed, quirky, almost manic energy, as well as a touch of Asperger's (he literally CANNOT understand why Watson would want to get married and retire from crimefighting). You can truly believe that this guy has a brain like a supercomputer.<br /><br />Law also gives an excellent performance as a young, vital Watson who seems to have a love-hate relationship with Holmes -- they're best friends, but Holmes' eccentricities are driving him nuts. Rachel McAdams gives a solid performance as Holmes' lady thief ex-girlfriend, and Mark Strong is wonderfully, sonorously sinister as the villain, who may or may not be a sorcerer.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" isn't actually based on any Sherlock Holmes stories, but Guy Ritchie's sharp-edged direction and Downey's quirky performance make it a fun experience. Just try to swallow the sillier action scenes.e massive fight at the shipyard in which Holmes and Watson almost get run over by a ship.<br /><br />But he balances out all the action with plenty of funny moments (Holmes repeatedly paralyzing poor Gladstone) and witty dialogue (\\"No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not!\\").

B005SQ3AI0|5.0|I was only familiar with a few cuts recorded by Dinah Washington when I ordered this collection, and I'm very glad that I bought it.  Her voice is distinctive: full, mellow, yet somehow still hard-edged in a way that both contrasts with and compliments the  competent but conventional musical arrangements that accompany her singing.  Her phrasing reveals her gospel, blues, and jazz roots.<br /><br />\\"September in the Rain\\" is a standout track, perhaps the best version ever recorded by anyone, but there are no throw-away cuts in this collection.  An enriching delight and a bargain, this is a silver dollar on the sidewalk waiting to be picked up.

B0073TBYTC|5.0|The late Stieg Larsson centered his Millennium Trilogy around cruelty towards women -- and the second of the trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" is a tightly wound thriller that is almost as good as the first. It lacks some of the raw, wild, dark energy, but it tangles together some razor-sharp social commentary (sex trafficking) with a plot centering on Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />A year after \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\\" Millennium magazine has a new reporter -- Dag Svensson and his girlfriend Mia are doing reports/books on sex trafficking and prostitution. At the same time, Lisbeth Salander has returned to Stockholm, and is cybereavesdropping on Mikael and Millennium -- only to discover an all-too-familiar name in Mia's sex trafficking report. Zala.<br /><br />Then Mikael finds both of them shot dead in their apartment, and Nils Bjurman -- the cruel \\"guardian\\" who raped Lisbeth -- has also been murdered.<br /><br />Lisbeth is the only suspect. But Mikael firmly believes she didn't do it -- especially since a hostile blond giant is going around beating up anyone (a trainer, a casual girlfriend) who might know Lisbeth's whereabouts. As Lisbeth goes on her own dark mission, she tells Mikael that he should look for someone named \\"Zala\\" -- but it turns out this mystery man has ties to Lisbeth's own dark past.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander was something of a mystery in \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" -- we knew she was troubled, a brilliant hacker, and had been in a psych ward. But \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" rips away all that mystery and shows us where Lisbeth Salander came from, and how she became a lonely, punky avenging angel. It's pretty nasty, and it ends on a cliffhanger (for crying out loud!).<br /><br />The biggest problem with this story is Larsson's story feels more scattered and hard to follow. But his style is still brilliant -- gritty and grimy, with lots of unpolished fighting, bloody violence, and some moments of sweetness (Lisbeth visiting her elderly ex-guardian). The most disturbing parts are undeniably the glimpses of Lisbeth's past, as well as the brutal descriptions of the sex trade (a man raping a girl to \\"train\\" her).<br /><br />And it's all wound around more unpleasant aspects of modern Swedish society, centering on cruelty towards women -- sex trafficking in a modern country, and the evil \\"Zala's\\" ability to get away with anything he wanted.<br /><br />And while Mikael is still a major force in this book, the spotlight is on Lisbeth, especially since Larsson sketches out a backstory for her (including a brain-damaged mother, her boxing skills, a twin sister, and so on). She's all half-healed hurts, wildcat energy and avenging dark angel mentality -- and there's something weirdly hypnotic about a character so completely outside the lines of \\"normal\\" society.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" doesn't have the spark of the first book, but it still has an electric brilliance and scathing social exploration. Just be sure to have the third book on hand by the time you finish.iting her elderly ex-guardian).

B0026J8LHM|5.0|This album is bar none my favorite of theirs. Each of these songs could stand on its own as an epic in any other album, but they chose to put them all into one album and it ties together greatly. The count of tuscany is by far my favorite dream theater song due to the composition and the story. That song alone is enough to make me love the album, but they are all great songs. If you like dream theater, James Labrie's voice, or just melodic prog metal, this is a must have for your collection.

B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I am actually surprised to find myself having to admit that I found this dramatized, detailed cinematic version of one of the great musicals of the later twentieth century to be virtually unwatchable.<br /><br />No, there was nothing wrong with it, per se. The performances are powerful, the look and feel detailed and dramatically sharp. Had it been done as an adaptation of the original Victor Hugo novel rather than the musical, I would probably have considered it a major dramatic accomplishment. The sheer power of it would have been startling.<br /><br />But somewhere along the path of converting the stage musical to this screen version, the entire soul and point of the original was completely tossed away, seemingly without a second thought, and what remains is a disquieting combination of the grimmest \\"reality\\" video imaginable and a strange, fumbling amature night by seasoned professional performers. Even Hugh Jackman, himself an experienced musical stage performer, seems to toss away his understanding of why a story is in musical form and the vast differences between telling a story with merely dialogue, and telling it with music and melody.<br /><br />That is really the primary question that seems to have been ignored in this film adaptation: Why tell a story in musical form instead of through acted, spoken dialogue?<br /><br />As an actor, with extensive experience in film, tv and staged musicals, the answer that gets drummed into you is that the author's intent is to have the emotional force and power carried primarily through the melody, harmony, orchestral arrangement and lyrics of the music instead of the actual performance.<br /><br />But there is another consideration that most people don't think about. Musicals are almost always written with the intention that they be performed live from a stage in front of a physically present audience. This means that each note and lyric must be performed with a certain minimum level of technical proficiency and clearenough to be understood at the very back of the theatre. The performer, no matter how emotionally involved in the moment, must make their primary job the skillful performance of the notes, rhythm, timing and mood of the song, over and above whatever emotions that performer might be experiencing as they sing it. The author almost never intends for their melody and lyrics to be lost and unintelligable beneath the blubbering noises of a performer totally drowned in a wave of emotion.<br /><br />In other words, the intent of writing a musical is for the sweeping, overpowering emotional impact to be borne by the songs themselves, not in the performance.<br /><br />But there is yet one more element that impacts this production. Les Miserables is not, strictly speaking, a musical. It is an opera. There is very little dialogue (considerably more than in the original staged version), with most of the exposition being communicated through sections, not of spoken dialogue, but of musical resetitive. Even those sections are intended by the author to be sung with a main focus on technical musical proficiency, rather than being \\"acted\\".<br /><br />The ultimate result in this version of Les Miz is that some of the key, emotionally most powerful musical moments are utterly wrecked because the actors are \\"acting\\" the songs rather than \\"singing\\" them. One glaring example is Fontine's heartbreaking \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", where the major climax resolution of the final motif (\\"I had a dream my life would so different from this hell I'm living\\") doesn't soar on that quick burst of agonized notes that stab straight through the heart. Instead it is replaced by a sobbing blubber of muttered words that kill that musical moment. Another is Hugh Jackman's Act One epiphany, after stealing from the priest, when he at last devotes himself to serving goodness and God. Jackman also dissolves into a wailing, sloppy mess of words, entirely wrecking the music which was originally intended to carry thatemotional moment.<br /><br />It appears the actors based their performances on being in the intimate, close-up environment of film rather than the strict, cooperative, technically proficient media of a musical.<br /><br />And considering the actions involved, the pain, horror, and depressing nature of the story and environment in which it is set, the entire production becomes grim almost beyond belief. If they'd concentrated instead on attempting to sing the songs properly, serving the music rather than working entirely against it, it might have made those emotionally devastating moments more palatable. As it is, by the time Jackman's Valjean confesses in open court in order to prevent the miscarriage of justice of letting an innocent man take the fall on his behalf, the entire piece has all the emotional richness of watching an unending documentary of Holocaust footage. It crams the \\"misery\\" into such high gear it becomes difficult to continue watching.<br /><br />The same thing happened to a somewhat lesser extent with the film version of Stephen Sondheim's \\"Sweeney Todd\\", where the actors were allowed, or perhaps deliberately encouraged, to \\"act\\" rather than \\"sing\\" the songs, rendering the songs superfluous.<br /><br />This is a continuing problem when attempting to take something created to be performed in a strict, stylized, highly defined standard such as a musical performed on a stage before a live audience, and convert it to the highly intimate environment of film. The two don't mesh well. If you focus on doing the songs properly, as intended, the result on film looks somewhat stilted. If you focus instead on the \\"acting\\" of the emotionally powerful moments, the music never meshes with the performance, sounding almost like an added and almost interfering background.<br /><br />In this case it turns what could have been a sweeping, grand and powerful musical statement about mankind's pain and hopes into a bit of a sloppy mess of noise and sound and overblownperformances that never entirely gel.<br /><br />I won't be attempting to watch this again any time soon. Instead I will pull out the Les Miserables concert performance of the entire score, where the entire point of doing the story as a musical is vibrantly presented as it was intended. that version allows the heart to soar with the music, not shift uncomfortably while watching a seemingly endless and pointless barrage of human suffering.

B008KOTNVA|4.0|Very good high quality set of precision drivers here. Contrary to what some people have said, I have not noticed any of the tips stripping away and the magnets in mine are still where they should be and have not become undone.<br /><br />Comes with a wide array of bits, more than I will ever need but knowing that they are there is an added bonus, so you won't be caught off guard.<br /><br />Two little niggles for me:<br /><br />1: The case could have been made a bit more sturdy, with a hard plastic mold inside, instead of the thin stuff you get.<br /><br />2. The driver itself is a bit long. Your fingers do have to stretch to reach the rubber grips, and even so the rubber grips don't really offer any grip. They should re-think that and probably make a driver V2, maybe with full rubber coating and a little shorter so you can really get your entire hand working.<br /><br />Other than that, I love this set, never let me down yet, and has already paid back for itself.

B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I have no idea why this was an academy award nominated movie. The reason must be the reverence many have for Lincoln as a major figure in American history and the anti-slavery issue/message. The dialogue was tedious and preachy nearly in every line spoken by Lincoln in this film. I wish I had spent my money and time watching something else. If Lincon was actually like this portrayal, it is very hard for me to understand why he was portrayed as so popular.  This was an anachronistic interpretation of Lincoln. The portrayal is of congress as a doing nothing body, divided along strict party/ideological lines opposed to a President who is only trying to do what is \\"the right thing to do.\\" A president who uses 'speeches' or talking to folks as his style of leadership. This has way too much flavor of what is going on here now in American politics.  This film seems bent on pushing certain current political views, rather than telling the truth or providing an accurate film portrait of the man in history.
B000002J6F|5.0|Lately, I have been buying a lot of music on CD from Amazon to make the time pass as I write reports.  Amazing amazing music. T-Rex Electric Warrior, Humble Pie, Tres Hombres from ZZ Top, early Fleetwood Mac, Joe Walsh's solo stuff.  But only one album is above the others, as good as the above are:  Stephen Stills Manassas.  The playing is hard edged, clear.  The songwriting intricate.  Country influenced blues, latin percussion, steel guitar, subtle, strong.  Chris Hillman and Steve Stills alone are stars, but what about Dallas Taylor on drums for excellence.  Al Perkins, Joe Lala, Paul Harris and Fuzzy Samuels each accomplished in their own right.  This should have been a band like The Band, together for a long enough time to do more.  But we have this, and that ain't bad.
1400069807|4.0|If you have read Michael Pollan's books on how to eat better, or even Barbara Kingsolver's books ... then this subject is not new to you. If you're just starting out on the journey to eating healthy, this book is interesting and informative. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this ... it writes like an interesting essay on how these giant corporations manage to take control of our food supply.<br /><br />This is not a preachy book by any means. This is an investigative piece and extremely well-written as Moss investigates why these three things are keeping Americans hooked and leading them down a pathway that our ancestors haven't faced ... Salt, Sugar and Fat. They are the biggest culprits in the rising health concerns that Americans are facing. Heart disease and obesity are on the rise, as well as diabetes. If you look at the food labels, you would see different kinds of ingredients listed and Moss set out to investigate just exactly what they were and even managed to interview former CEOs of the corporations that control the majority of our food supply.<br /><br />It is a fascinating read especially when you read about the scientific experiments in creating food products that will stay on the shelf for a long period of time. Moss also provides some historical tidbits as to how this all got started. It started with cereal. Then it progresses onto how sugar became the staple of our diet and so on. It is really a fascinating read if you are interested in science and psychology. It is also disturbing when one realizes just how manipulative the corporations are in placing these items on the grocery shelves, right at eye-level, just to keep boosting the sales.<br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the three ingredients that are not so healthy for our diets, this book is for you. If you are already knowledgeable, then this book might be more of a repeat of what others have been saying for years. I have been working on eating a lot less processed foods for years and this book only confirms what I already know. However, it is still a fascinating and informative read for me personally.<br /><br />4/8/13
B004BLTNL6|4.0|As an Art History minor, I've taken particular note of how rape is portrayed in all mediums. Blue Velvet remains one of my favorite films as does A Clockwork Orange. I thought that those films had pretty gruesome rape scenes, but this film takes the cake. Often I was unable to watch. If a loved one has ever told you that they were once abused, assaulted, etc. I'm sure that you've had some revenge fantasies. Imagine what the victim must think. This film delves exactly into that.

B008602KQI|3.0|I thought the acting was good, but I don't like the idea of kids killing each other.  I know its a movie, but its just not my thing.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|It is a shame A list actors take advantage of their reputation to make trash. I can only assume they do this for their own amusement. I would give this negative stars if it were an option. Don't waste your time or money and don't assume just because an actor(s) has made hit movies in the past that it means anything at all.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great app gives me all the information i am looking for.  was hard to get use to the new format all the info was there you just had to look for it.  but still great app.  can have several cites to choose from saved i just really like it
0810983915|5.0|My 11 year old son has finally found some books to keep him interested in reading.  With all the TV and video games out there, and as much as we limit them, he just thinks reading is too boring. Well these books have helped change that view!  Thank you for wring such great books that kids can relate to.
055357342X|3.0|No spoilers here, just the comment that if HBO stays true to the storyline the way it was written in the book, it should be interesting to see how many fans still like the show at the end of Season 3?<br /><br />I purchased all 5 books on audio from Amazon, I am not sure I can invest the time to listen to books 4 & 5. I really don't like most of the characters who have managed NOT to die yet,and if I start to like them even a little, or maybe just  respect them, I am sure they will get killed off too in books 4 and 5. So I have to ask myself, do I want listen and find out what happens, or just wait and watch HBO instead because they will probably \\"dress the story\\" up a little better and make it more palatable?
B008DVJMAW|5.0|no idea why I had not heard them before but they are awesome! you will not regret this purchase.  wow
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is a must see movie. The story turned out to be something totally unexpected. I love this movie and plan on watching it several more times in the near future !!!! :-)

0307454568|5.0|This is a fine ending to the \\"Millenium\\" trilogy. You should read the series in order of publication, i.e. [[ASIN:0307949486 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Book 1 of the Millennium Trilogy)]], and [[ASIN:0307949508 The Girl Who Played with Fire: Book 2 of the Millennium Trilogy]]. While further evolving the character of Lisbeth Salandar, this novel also introduces the surprising behind-the-scenes entity responsible for much of the violence in the trilogy. Since this was planned as a ten book series, you may find seeming loose ends or budding new storylines that seem to be left hanging. The tragic sudden death of the author after completing the trilogy (and leaving a partially completed book 4), leaves the question of further stories up in the air until rights issues are resolved.
0783114893|5.0|i always have to leave long reviews so here it is liked thwe movie it was pretty cool thank you very much

B0000AFX64|5.0|loed it this movie was so really cool had not seen it in a long time thank you very much
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This is a good calculator to use if you just want the basic functions.  I was looking for something that was more versitile so I downloaded a scientific calculator instead.  This is still a pretty good download.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game worth the money.  it was very challenging. and the graphics were great.  Can't wait for the next game. Hope it's just as challenging.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this app I like 2 jam out to music while I play but it can get lame and  boring sometimes and I really don't like the updates they r so annoying they happen like 24/7 this app is not the best<br /> the best app in the world is draw something
B00797MB0O|1.0|I'm not one to write reviews like this. I'm not one to critique movies. I don't like when people leave spoilers.<br />BUT DON'T BOTHER WATCHING THIS MOVIE.<br />It is awkwardly bad. Beyond words. I can't describe it.<br />Charlize Theron is a great actress. She has awards to prove it. I almost wonder if she knew when filming that this movie would be so bad. I hope it's just bad post-production or something.<br />Absolutely terrible movie.<br />Wasn't even worth my Prime subscription free viewing. I want a $3.99 credit on my Prime account for this movie.<br />Terrible.<br />Should have trusted the other reviewer's comments. Shoulda. Wish I could do 0 stars.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Before reading this book, I can say that I already knew what  Heaven was and was secure in the fact that I will someday be there. This book brings comfort to those that question Heavens existence.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Terrific movie. Staggering beautiful images and stunning camera work. Great story with real depth. Has religious overtones which may make it somewhat objectionable to some but overall, a great film.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is a great three in one movie collection.  It is bound to be a classic.  I really like Nolan's style
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This show is awesome. Mind blowing in every episode. Incredible quality of production and fascinating shots of nature like you'll never see elsewhere.

B0087YYHZU|5.0|Regarded by many critics to be one of the ten best movies ever made and the greatest musical of all time, Singing in the Rain, brings to the screen seamless dance choreography and some of the most memorable songs ever incorporated into a musical.<br /><br />Begins with the hero, played by Gene Kelly, attending a Hollywood premier accompanied by his side-kick and in answering a question put forth by the announcer, providing a rather distorted and glorified account of his career.<br /><br />Then, proceeds to a love triangle between the leading actress who constantly co-stars with him in silent movies, who being infatuated with him, feels that he belongs to her despite the fact that he doesn't share her feelings, and that of a relatively unknown performer with bit parts whom he finds himself unaccountable attracted to, and, resultant of this, finding ways to introduce her into the lime light of the acting profession.<br /><br />This, ironically, comes to fruition through a bumbling mistake in synchronizing the visual and audio elements of him film after the studio attempts to make a talkie and attempting to rectify the problem without much success, thereby, deciding to turn it into a musical, which given the fact that Kelly's leading actress has the voice of a hyena, prompts the studio to use the unknown as a voice-over which, eventually, comes to be known to the public, thereby, launching her career.<br /><br />One of the best musicals ever made hands down.

0783225733|5.0|My nine year old loves this movie!  He hasn't had it that long and has watched it 3 times.  He says that if he can find a good book, this might be his choice for reading fair next year!

B006ZS81GG|5.0|Lana Del Rey is the best singer/songwriter I have ever encountered since I discovered a love for music in my early teenage years. I listen to a variety of music ranging from Imagine Dragons, Poets of the Fall, and Nightwish to Bette Midler, Enya, and First Aid Kit.<br /><br />My ever-evolving taste in music was intrigued the first time I accidentally heard a preview of \\"Video Games\\" during a late-2011 Amazon.com search and resulted in my purchasing the song for a closer look.<br /><br />I wanted to hear more. I learned Lana had released one other song: \\"Blue Jeans.\\" It was brilliant--it challenged my musical preferences and ensured I would await the release of her first full album with overwhelming anticipation.<br /><br />Then came \\"Born to Die.\\" If you haven't listened to the song, it should be first experienced with the official music video. By the time I heard the words \\"Come and take a walk on the wild side,\\" I was blown away by Lana's vocal range and style.<br /><br />\\"When can I purchase the entire album???\\"<br /><br />The album finally became available and I was instantly in love with tracks \\"National Anthem\\" and \\"Summertime Sadness.\\" More recently, I have come to appreciate \\"Million Dollar Man\\" and \\"Lucky Ones.\\" I tend to get caught up in a swirl of pseudo-vintage splendor every time I start to play this record--because, as all of Lana's fans know, one does not simply listen to one Lana Del Rey song.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|I actually threw this movie away after watching it. I couldn't think of any friend who would like it, or any library or donation site that would appreciate such a wanton waste of time and so yes I tossed it. I thought several people did a great job of expressing the reasons why the movie totally failed, but I just had to add my one star rating, in the hopes of saving some poor fool $7.99 or whatever it is priced at now.
141694737X|5.0|This book is one of the all time favorites self-picked by baby to be read over and over.  Baby loves to lift the flaps to see the animals hiding behind.  Very durable book - the lift the flaps aren't flimsy (tearable) like many I have seen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|HAPPY HUNGER GAMES AND MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR. This book is the best. I'm about to read the next one...and the next one. If u ask me what the best book I read was I would say hunger games!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Despite the poor reviews form the major critics, John Carter was still a fantastic movie, and deserving of a few sequels. Just give the audience who does not know Captain Jack Carter some kind of emotional tie to the character please?!?! For me it was the major lacking piece of the movie content.  For my kids, not knowing who John Carter was, the movie did not reach them at an emotional level which would have endeared the character(s) to them.<br /><br />For the rest of us, we could get past that, and the mixing up of the books and story lines.  Not all Star Trek movies are good...  but we still keep making them, and they are getting better.  Lets do the same for John Carter and make Edgar Rice Burroughs proud.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love it, however, once you start it's hard to stop. I'm only on Classic right now and know eventually I'll be giving my brain a great workout.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game, totally addicting, however I don't like the fact that you have to like it's product on Facebook to get rewards
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|All the songs sound very much alike.  It did not do his magnificent voice justice.  Hope the next album contains more of his usual style.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|This game is just another bejeweled game, nothing that exciting. They taking a concept of the round the world in 80 days every day is other boring Bejeweled game.<br /><br />I have a Nexus 4 an every so often in the game the touchscreen doesn't work. I have to put my phone the opposite way for the touch screen to work. I'm surprised they haven't came out with a patchon this issue.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Great fictional account of William Wallace! A little bit of comedy, some fighting and a great tale. Nothing else needed to make a good movie!

B001TNGOXY|5.0|Love this story so well written, and no it's not dated just a story that you can believe in and want to keep on watching right to the very end after that you feel, yes! I would like to watch this again later on, what more could you want from a great movie?. Barbara. Australia.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I have always loved this artist. I have several of his cds and I love them all!!! This one included
B004X4QW42|5.0|I don't know where the lower stars are coming from, but as a martial arts film conneusseur AND as a practitioner, I found this film enticing and the fight scenes well done. I've never heard of this series before. So, my first exposure was this one (part 2), which I streamed last night. I liked it enough to order the 4th DVD in the series.<br /><br />Other reviews state that the main character was also in Jet Li's Heroes. Again, that film was pure art and artistry. In this film, you feel like you are back in the period, and you easily attach to its characters. And, the martial arts choreography was moving.<br /><br />If you enjoy good martial arts films with real plots, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Thanks for creating this film and the series.<br />I look forward to the next chapter.<br /><br />~~
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The alarm lets me pick my favourite song as a wake-up tone. It can also makes several alarms at once. Great for busy people
B000N2HBSO|5.0|There really isn't much to put  here except that it is a must read  for history buffs everywhere. Goodwin pays extraordinary attention to detail and the result is one of the most exhaustive works on Lincoln to this day.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|This is a heart-warming comedy that everyone can relate to in one way or another. For a story about the Holocaust, there is an overwhelming amount of love.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is an unbelievable piece of truth, that one must take the time to digest. Years of being trapped must be broken down and if you are ready to BE enlightened, your teacher has arrived!
B004G5Z0DW|1.0|My granddaughter was tremendously disappointed when the movie would not play on our DVR on Easter afternoon. I had no idea there even was such a thing as play zones. I will not order more movies from Amazon unless this seller makes it right for me.

B008OOYALE|5.0|Oh my God. I love this game . It's so much fun. And adopting those cutie, adorable, and happy game. It's so much fun.
0307960471|4.0|Jo Nesbo's next addition to the Harry Hole series is an excellent whodunit. Harry returns to Oslo to help his ex-lover Rakel. Her son, Oleg, is accused of murdering his friend over drugs. The book is a wild ride through the Oslo drug culture, and police corruption. Many, many interesting elements to a plot that keeps you guessing until the very end. This book is very dark. If Harry gets beaten up anymore I am afraid their won't be enough pieces to put back together. Nesbo is not quite in Michael Connelly and Laura Lippman's league but he is pretty darn good.
B00AU2B0DE|2.0|To kiddie and a poor singing voice. The only thing that saves this is the Musical instruments and the end!

B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love my Marware case. It fits perfectly on my kindle and it was affordable. It is so convenient and keeps my kindle from getting scratched up.
B007EW9ISM|3.0|I watched the YouTube review on 10 Best Stylus for the IPAD. I bought 2.  This is one. It is as you see bulky. I use it for some games. I don't like it for writing.  I have arthritis in my hands so I prefer the larger hold but this is heavy and I drop it alot.  I'm not crazy about it but I'm keeping it.  Granddaughter likes it.  It is responsive only at the very tip, so I'm sure why it is so heavy.  Weight lifting for the fingers I guess.
B00B671W6W|4.0|I love Anthrax, and have always been a big fan of their cover songs!  From Parasite, Love Her All I Can, and She, to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Cowboy Song.  Unfortunately, I feel like this EP is kind of a mixed bag.<br /><br />I think the song choices and performances on Anthem, Smokin', Keep On Running, and Big Eyes are amazing!!  The whole band sounds killer - particularly Joey!  These are not easy songs to pull off vocally, and he sounds great!  The harmony vocals on Smokin' are spot on as well.  I think the production on the EP also sounds great.<br /><br />There are, in my opinion, a couple of weak spots on a short CD.  I thought TNT was a weak choice by AC/DC.  I understand the song's a classic, but I for one, don't really need to hear it again!  It would be like them doing a cover of Rock n Roll All Nite.  Something a little more under the radar like Touch Too Much, Walk All Over You, Shoot To Thrill, Shot Down in Flames, etc... would have been much better!  I also feel the same way about Jailbreak, though I'm not quite as sick of this song.<br /><br />I also didn't really need Crawl +  Crawl Remix.  Most Anthrax fans probably bought Worship Music and already have Crawl, and to me remixes are completely unnecessary!<br /><br />Anyhoo, I give it four stars for four killer covers, and skip all the others!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Would be better if it had more levels but for a game that you can just pick up and play it is very good
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Two months ago I'd never heard of this guy.  What a wonderful surprize was in my immediate future.  With only one exception my favorite song on this album is the one I am currently listening to at the moment.  Joe has a very expressive voice which can easily carry a wide range of emotions and it works really great in this acoustical venue.  I believe the general consensus is that he is a genius on the guitar and I heartily agree.  The collection of fine musicians on this album are excellently highlighted on the down home ho-down blues of Athens to Athens and I like his acoustical Slow Train much better than the electric version.  Since his music is new to me, I was delighted by some of the surprizing turns which a number of the songs take.  They demonstrate a thorough knowledge of what makes great music both on the technical and gut level.  It is abundantly clear on a lot of these selections that these very good musicians are having a lot of fun.  When I played the album for my wife she called the album emotional aerobics and she nailed it.  This makes two live concert recordings which left me grieving that I wasn't there.  I would trade a dozen experiences of my number two for having been at the Vienna Opera House on that particular evening.  I am seriously considering going to Corpus Christi in November to see him there since he doesn't seem to be coming to Dallas on this coming tour.  I'm no groupy and don't plan to start anything new but seeing him live would absolutely have to be a great experience.  Hope he will come here on his next tour and I'd be even happier if he would do another unplugged show here.

B004WMKXWM|1.0|Good luck with Amazon's instant video service.  I've tried it a couple of times now and it sucks.  Download was very slow. Amazon provides no option for getting a refund on video. Netflix's works much better.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Very bittersweet, but very good, would recommend to anyone who loves Nicholas sparks books. only cried a little at the end.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Courtroom dramas are a genre that I like.  I was a very fast read and kept my interest till the last page.
B008OOYALE|5.0|You should totally get this app it is free and fun and all the other storm8 games are free and you get to complete missions and stuff... A definite great game for little kids.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Good luck with Amazon's instant video service.  I've tried it a couple of times now and it sucks.  After paying for this movie I was unable to download it.  Amazon provides no option for getting a refund on video. Netflix's works much better.

1439102813|5.0|I enjoyed reading Still Alice and the insight from a person suffering from this horrible disease....some things I had never thought about!  Recommend to anyone diagnosed or caring for someone.
B008LC8TJI|3.0|There are a few songs that I really liked on this album, namely the singles that were radio released. Unfortunately the &#34;payphone&#34; explicit album version turns not just explicit, but brash. The radio edit should have been included on the CD. I recommend if you like Maroon 5 as I do, just buy the singles MP3 style to save money and only get the better songs from this project.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Great action, kept a steady flow of activity. A fast easy read I had a hard time putting down. Good book
B007REV4YI|1.0|I am going to start renting movies before I buy them.  This was the worst James Bond movie ever made. Rent the movie if you must see it from redbox first.  that way you are only out $1.20
B003P93HJO|5.0|Solti's famous 1977 performance with Price, Baker, and the Chicago Symphony and Chorus remastered and released on single CD - it doesn't get better than this. Highly Recommended! P.S. Why are 37 reviews on this page all for DIFFERENT recordings - not Solti's. This is so frustrating!
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|good graphics!! really a fun no - brainer way to waste some time.  I enjoy simple matching games.<br />I tryto relax in the pm
B008133MDK|5.0|This is by far one of the most compelling shows I have every watched.  The shows are movie length about 1hour and a half per episode.  thats probably why there is only 3 per season.  I would love more episodes that is the only downside.  Other than that.. it is a great watch.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I am very disappointed that for some reason it stopped working. I deleted it, and tried to download again to start over but it won't download. Not sure why. Hopefully I can get it to download again because we love it!

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|He loves this game! He likes that he is the shark and gets to eat people and other fish. Keep in mind though, he is going to be 13, I would not recommend for young children because it shows the blood in the water.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this story!  Can't wait to see the movie.  Not so sure how important it was to bring in the supernatural Jo, though.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I was about to throw in the towel without even telling my husband, because he is to busy with work and furthering his education.  We have been married for 25+ years and that is to much time invested in just throwing in the towel when you still love someone.  So without him reading this book I plan to implement what I have learned and hopefully with the knowledge from this book and the guidance of God our marriage will not only be saved but be blessed and we again can be a blessing to others in our life.
B00006674X|5.0|Change Of Habit is a good film. More than the usual Elvis fllm. Great co-stars with Jane Eliot, Mary Tyler Moore, Barbara McNair, Darlene Love and The Blossoms, and a bit by the hilarious Doro Merande. Elvis as a doctor actually works well.
B005HSL626|3.0|Fruit Ninja is a.very good game with some great modes and challenges but has a problem once you unlock every sword and background. Now every time I try to get in it goes to the loading screen then goes back to my carousel. Now I can't get in. So please fix that otherwise ok.

B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|When it comes to athletes turned actors, I define the spectrum as The Rock at one end (very good, lots of charisma) and Hulk Hogan/Jessee Ventura at the other (can't act their way out of a wet paper bag). Carano falls somewhere in between. She definitely does not have the charisma of The Rock, and in this movie is very raw. You can tell that the script was written with that in mind. She is not good at conveying emotion. While she does have potential, and if she keeps at it and gets training, can probably be OK, her performance here is best described as wooden. You could not tell the difference between any emotional state. She was the same serious, angry, horny, and scared. She is basically there to look pretty and fight. And she does that well.<br /><br />There is a good backing ensemble cast that you can tell was put in place to support that fact that Carano was green. Unfortunately the script was such that they even the A list actors in the cast could do much. All that said, if you are in to action movies, and can handle a so so script and marginal acting ability from the lead role, this can be enjoyable. It does not take itself too seriously, and is just the right length. If you are a casual fan of action movies though, you may not like this one.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, doubly so because it was something I could share with my family. It was original and loosely based on life and there was no telling between the lies and the truth. Great movie.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|A wonderful adaptation of the 1986 graphic novel...my only wish is that the animation more closely followed Frank Miller's graphic style...aside from that...no real complaints.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This was a terrific collection of his music. Not only with the Allman Brothers but Delaney and Bonnie as well as Derek and the Dominoes were excellent.
B009CGAUW6|4.0|I have fond memories of this game from my childhood in the late 70s/early 80s.  It is fun, easy and family friendly.  It is not a complicated D&D style game - just a simple fight monsters with dice rolling and grab the treasure (or trap!). I still have the old game set and introduced it to my son when he was around 8 years old.  It was an instant favorite for him.  Since then we introduced the game to relatives and his friends (ages elementary to college).  He is now 12 and his friends request to play the game when they come over.  Also keep in mind that you will get even more out of it if you dramatize the game a little. For instance, if you fight the \\"Blue Dragon\\", \\"Purple Worm\\" or \\"Black Pudding\\" or any other monster that lurks in the Dungeon - talk in a deep slow voice to make it sound epic.  The kids will love it.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|This brings back so many memories....Now we're beginning to get our kids involved with GNR. My youngest will rock out and sway right along with Axel. Hilarious to watch!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I have read this series in Hardback, but as my kindle gets more use these days, I will continue to download some of my favorites in e format.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fun game. It was worth the price for the full version. I enjoyed it. G5 has lots of fun games to play.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Once I finally received the DVD, I was thrilled to get it.  I love Downton Abbey and  can't for the next season.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its great. Fun to play. Challenging. Must make strategic moves and be creative. Enjoy the missions and daily events and letters you must collect. Also play with friends via facebook.
B000UD08HW|4.0|I have had this blue ray for over a year now and it is awesome! Gilmore is one of the best guitar and vocalist out! I have been to the Australian pink Floyd show and last night the British pink Floyd show. As far as this goes its a great set of songs. The only issue I have is the video quality. Its very grainy. That is the only reason for me giving the four stars. The sound and songs are great!!
B00003BDXG|3.0|I thought the idea was good and I actually wrote a paper for psychology class on the movie. I have mixed feelings Bout the movie and found it to be a little weird to be honest.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have a number of knives for various purposes that get used a lot, from work around the yard, in my engineering work, and as pocket knives. While I take care of them often, they do get less sharp than I'd like on occasion. In the past, I've used various sharpening stones (including diamond) to bring the edges back to razor sharpness, a sometimes tedious (but relaxing) process. This sharpener, for all of $8, seemed like something I could check out. The PP1 has three sharpening tools: a carbide sharpener, a ceramic sharpener, and a conical rod (for serrated blades).<br /><br />The carbide portion is designed for blade edges that are truly dull or have nicks in them; I used this on an old hunting knife (1930's design) I have been trying to rehabilitate. With only a half-dozen strokes, it let me remove all but the most minor imperfections on the edge, including some rust pits. A final touch-up with the ceramic sharpener provided a nice clean and sharp edge.<br /><br />The ceramic sharpener is really designed for final touch-ups and re-sharpening. Because anything other than a really sharp knife is anathema to me, I was really curious as to how well the PP1 would work. Well, it works pretty darned well. My main pocket carry is an original Kershaw Chive that gets daily use. Using the ceramic sharpener brought the edge back from pretty sharp to razor sharp with only 5 strokes. I had similar results with my Benchmade Griptillian, an old Swiss Army knife (1970's style), and a much cheaper plastic-handle Kershaw.<br /><br />The conical sharpener, which folds into the sharpener body, is designed for serrated blade segments and also seems to work well, but takes a little more care in use. The several knives I have with serrated blades seem to have slightly different angles and depths to the serrations, meaning you need to pay attention when sharpening. The sharpener also is relatively thin, and is thinner than the serration openings on my knives. Again, it means paying some attention when using it. It does work well, however, especially for small touch-ups. It also does a good job at removing any small burrs created during conventional sharpening.<br /><br />The sharpener body itself is fairly small, made mostly of plastic, and could easily be a daily pocket carry. It has a lanyard hole at one end and a thumb depression on each side to make it easy to hold right or left handed. The two sharpeners can be replaced (I haven't tried that yet) by removing two screws. The knife blade can be stroked from either side of the two main sharpeners with the same results, and each sharpener is clearly labeled on both sides. The sharpeners work especially well on knives with curved blades such as my Chive, which has a back-curve portion of the blade near the handle; it's a tough area to sharpen with a whetstone, but easy with the PP1.<br /><br />While inexpensive, the PP1 is a good alternative to using a whetstone, and has several advantages over that method, especially for smaller knives. Glad I bought it.
0634022296|5.0|This book is great for learning Beatles tunes quickly and accurately. It is more helpful I would think, to a rhythm guitarist, as you only get the chords, and although you can usually figure out the little lead parts from the chord progression, it is in no way indicated here. But this why it's called a chord book.<br /><br />Anyways, this book contains pretty much every song The Beatles released. They are listed alphabetical, but I almost wished that they had grouped songs from the same album together in chronological fashion. But, its easy enough to mark off the pages of the particular songs you want to play.<br /><br />I bought the book to practice guitar with (I am a bass player) and I have found the Beatles are great to sit down, learn some different chords, and commit them to memory by playing along with the albums. The accuracy is astounding sometimes, where you always thought you were hearing Am in &#34;I Will&#34;, its really A7, which you can hear if you look for it.  Also The Beatles were known to play tuned down a half or whole step sometimes, and to speed up or slow down recordings a bit, so in the beginning of each song, it is indicated if you need a capo, or if the song is detuned. Very helpful for playing along to the recordings.<br /><br />The lyrics are included, and so this book can help you practice singing and playing at the same time, which is one of the harder aspects of guitar playing, after simply mastering the instrument.<br /><br />The drawback of this book is that it is bound like a regular book, with a glued spine. This is OK, but with almost 200 pages, you will need to either really work the spine, or get some clips to hold the pages back on a stand. If this book were spiral bound, there'd be no problem. I guess the best work around is just to photocopy your selections first.<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars for how great a resource it is, because you can get the complete sheet music (with chord diagrams) for more money, but if you don't read music, you're paying for a lot of work that in the end is useless to you. Just having the chord diagrams here is enough for me.n't read music, you're paying for a lot of work that in the end is useless to you. Just having the chord diagrams here is enough for me.
B0042LIDPM|5.0|Bought this as a bday gift for someone. They were floored and went on and on about it for days.
1401324649|2.0|This book is just too silly for my liking.  A real spoof, but just not my thing.<br />The storyline is outrageous and at no time believable.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|First of all, I really enjoy Scalzi's works. His humor comes through and the story lines generally are very good and well-plotted, with no &#34;deux ex machina&#34; moments. Having said that, I was truly unprepared for the direction this book takes.<br /><br />The crew of the UU starship Intrepid are getting killed off at an unusual rate while on &#34;away&#34; teams, especially the junior officers (the &#34;Redshirts&#34;). Then Ensign Dahl, a little more observant than your normal Redshirt, gets assigned to the Intrepid and quickly figures out that &#34;something isn't right.&#34; As he gets other crewmembers around to his point of view, he figures out what might be happening and comes up with a plan. Unfortunately, I can't say much more without giving away the story, other than saying that time-travel and black holes are involved, but Scalzi develops it really well, keeps the humor up throughout, and ties up everything nicely with the three codas at the back of the book.<br /><br />Well done Mr. Scalzi, well done. Now, about that sequel to &#34;The Android's Dream&#34; ....
B005GSVFBE|5.0|I remember when Toy Story originally came. It was a game changer at the time. No one else did anything like it. The graphics, the animation, the detail. Everything looked so real. I couldn't believe that I was watching a cartoon. Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, and the entire cast provide some of the greatest voices to the classic movie. I think I have purchased Toy Story on every medium that it's been on. I still have the VHS copy, I have multiple versions of the DVD. When I saw that there was a digital copy of it, I knew I had to have it.<br /><br />The digital copy offers two versions. You may get it through iTunes or you may get a copy to watch in Windows Media Player. I chose to have my copy go through iTunes. This means that I can watch the movie on any of my &#34;i&#34; devices including my iPhone, iPad, and AppleTV. I love that I can play it on my AppleTV. It makes the watching experience so much easier. I don't have to worry about getting a disc out, loading it in the player, and possibly scratching it. It's always ready for me to watch whenever I want.<br /><br />The quality of the digital copy is excellent. It looks like it is somewhere between DVD and Blu-ray quality. I highly recommend getting a digital copy and choosing the iTunes version if you have the means to do so. It can go on any &#34;i&#34; device and it travels easily. Kids can watch it in the car.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The wonderful handling of a subject so wrought with opinion and controversy is beautifully orchestrated during this wonderful novel.  The characters are genuine, likeable and complex.  I laughed and cried throughout the book and was left thinking about so many issues that were examined through the novel's action. How much of our destiny is determined by birth, upbringing and situation? Do we control the smallness or largeness of the lives we choose? Can we really be our own change agents and step out of comfort zones we believed we desired? What about expectations from our families; how much of life develops around those? If you are considering this book, read it!  Great book club choice too.  I would also recommend it to mature teens.
B005I2YL4G|5.0|This is my running my NAS system. It has been going great for the past couple months. The NAS is always on and is active quite a bit. This thing has kept up without missing a beat. I couldn't be happier with the purchase, I have more than enough power that I can't really see an upgrade happening for quite some time. I would recommend this to anyone contemplating a NAS build.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's exactly like having a real horse and I have always wanted a horse so I love this game so much just awesome.You get to take care of your own virtual animal.
B005GSVFB4|5.0|My wife and I love the animated Pixar movies and Toy Story 2 is no exception. Buzz, Woody, and the whole gang bring everything that the first movie had many years before it. It brings laughter and tears to anyone that watches it. The four-disc combo has everything.<br /><br />**Spoiler**<br />The back-story of Jessie with Emily and how kids grow up but the toys never do really reaches deep inside you. It makes you look back at how you treated your toys and what they are doing now. You never fully understand the changes you go through as you grow up, and Toy Story 2 makes you truly look back.<br />**Ending Spoler**<br /><br />I love watching the digital version on my AppleTV. Having the Blu-ray and DVD copies are great, but having digital versions make the watching experience so much easier. There are options to get the iTunes version or a Windows Media Player version. I have the iTunes version and that makes it so I can watch the movie at anytime in any place I want. The movie can go with me on my iPhone and iPad. I can also re-download the digital copy from iTunes if happen to lose it.  The quality of the digital copies are very somewhere between DVD and Blu-ray.<br /><br />I highly recommend Toy Story 2 to not only kids but to adults too. Pixar does an excellent job relating their movies to kids AND adults.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This is a real eye opener and life changer!  Took me from a stressful life to cloud nine! Best investment.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh! Hugh! Hugh!  I have to say that on reading the description of your book, I was intrigued .  I love  sci-fi.  It<br />Is  hard to find good material however .  I bought three other books from the group that yours was in and none of them were very good!  I was about to give up when I started reading your amazing book!!!  This is a fresh idea, the characters are well developed and believable.  I would recommend this book to everyone who wants a great read!!!!  Thanks!!! Can not wait for  the next  one!!!!

B00000JNO2|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd.... one of the greatest bands ever.  Not only was their music inspiring, &#34;All I can do is write about it&#34;, but their real life story is mesmerizing.  This album doesn't have any main stream hits, but the songs are better because you've never heard them on the radio.  If you are new or old to Skynyrd, get this album!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Saw this at the dollar movie house today. Originally watched it in back to back during the week it opened at the cineplex. With each showing, the movie get better. A copy of the shooting script is available free online and is fascinating to follow. Even though I knew it was coming the second and third I saw the movie, the scene where Django says this final goodbye to Schultz remains gut wrenching.<br />Don't know what the SFX magicians did to the torch fire in the KKK scene, but the effect is a work of art.<br />The scene of the plantation workers with rifles streaming onto the mansion's mezzanine firing barrages at Django flashed me back to the final scene of Butch Cassidy.<br />As it turns out, Leo D really did cut his hand and just kept on with the scene.<br /><br />Django is a classic that with endure for many, many, years.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Watch it every week...think it is one of the better comedy shows that have been on tv in a long time
0321544080|5.0|This is, in my opinion, a little advanced for a beginner, but for intermediate and more advanced photographers it is a virtual gold mine of useful information. No elaborate & often times meaningless theories, just good solid information written in a humorious style
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is so challenging.  it starts off easy but gradually gets harder. you will really enjoy this app. you will not put this game down.
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|I am 54 years old and I fell \\"In Love\\" with the first Bruno Mars CD I loved every song on it. So when I heard about a new Bruno Mars CD coming out I pre ordered it just knowing that I would love this one as well. I was shocked it was a total let down for me. The songs were dirty, weird and not one of the songs could I honestly say I enjoyed listening too.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|I bet this is a very good app; but sadly I'm not able to get it because of geographical restrictions. Please fix it. Thank you very much in advance.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Very fun adventure game.  Levels are not too long and good for short plays. Great graphics and cool music.  For free, definitely worth the price.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I like the game but nowhere did it say when you downloaded it that it was a trial version.  This was disappointing to find out.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a fun and relaxing little game. I've only been playing a few days but I keep going back to it which is always a good sign.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is such a great movie with a standout cast.  The interplay between the British visitors and their \\"India\\" experience is wonderful to watch.  The colors and scenes of India are amazing as well as the scenes between children and various members of the cast.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, Dev Patel and the rest of this superb group of actors.  A must see!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've been using Arctic Silver for years, and it's the only thermal compound I use. Whether I'm building a new system, or upgrading an old one, Arctic Silver has never let me down. My CPU temperatures are always a few degrees cooler when replacing the standard thermal paste or thermal pads that most PC and CPU manufacturers use. I even sometimes use it on my GPU cards too to keep them cool. I highly recommend it. If you're a novice on applying thermal compound, I highly recommend you go to Arctic Silver's website and read the excellent instructions on doing it correctly.

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I've really enjoyed this game on my A700.  It is highly addictive and can be very challenging.  Even after full completion, the various arcade mode play can be randomized so that even the most challenging level can be repeated with a unique solution.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I like adventure and Greek  stuff it's not everyday  you run into monsters ,giants,and demigods I hope other people like this book my friend Ashley  read all the Rick  Riordan's books.
1609611543|5.0|This is a great book!!<br /><br />Dr. William Davis has some very good information on why our modern-day hybrid wheat has very little in commone with the  wheat from centuries ago, or even the wheat our grandparents ate during the first half of the 20th century.  He explains how so many of our present day diseases are due to eating today's hybrid wheat, and how our diet if full of it.  He explains why the government endorsed diet high in whole grains, expecially wheat, is not a healthy diet, but is making us sick.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, enough that I'm considering buying more copies of it to give as presents to friends and relatives.
B005LAIII0|5.0|what a wonderful story. has to be added to any serious movie collectors collection. everything you've heard about the movie is true.<br />was not prepared for the ending tho. this is a multiple viewing movie and can't wait to watch it again. loved the special features section about how this movie was planned and plotted out. was almost like going to film school for free.<br />wonder how it will look on a 3D tv.....hmnn,Santa?
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Purchased this as a wedding gift for my bride and surprised her as we drove to our cabin in the smokey mountains.  She would tell you it was the best wedding gift we got.  She has watched these entire 10 seasons many times over.  If these every break, I will by more.

B009LRE040|5.0|I love these versions of Batman, because it shows the true dark avenger.  The man torn with pain feeling he has to fix what he didn't break.  Memories drives him forward to do what is right.
B00ATSS73U|4.0|Darlene habeen and still is my favourite Christian singer and I enjoyed listening to most of this Cd.<br />I think she has some previous work that I like better but maybe I am getting older?<br />Victor's Crown is the best piece [as far as I am concerned].
B0058WFO06|4.0|Not conforming to the main stream Steven<br />Wilson performs his own music his own way. Not all song make it though.
B005H9B44A|5.0|It was great to watch this movie because I saw the avengers and didn't see this one first.  Great acting as if from another planet and not knowing customs.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|It's exactly what I was expecting. It's a box set with all three movies in the box. Essentially you're buying all 3 blu-ray dvds in one box. That's exactly what you're gonna get
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|If you were a fan of Prog-Rock and the bands of the late 70's early 80's you will be happy to know that Steven Wilson has carried on the tradition. You can never go wrong with a Hammond C-3, Fender Rhoads, and a Mellotron.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Much better than the last, although it would be nice to start closing some stories before opening new ones. The characters that we love are now scattered and their stories don't seem to move along.  I am hooked, however, and now I want my next fix.
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|Not worth wasting your time to see this video.  The media really hipped this movie to much, as they do most of the time.

0790742780|5.0|This movie is awesome!  It should be re-released for today's frustrating times.<br />I purchased this movie after having a personal melt-down and going for therapy<br />and mentioning that I felt &#34;like Michael Douglas in Falling Down&#34;.  She knew<br />what I was talking about!  It's an eye-opener, if you've never seen it, that deals<br />with the everyday b.s. we all deal with and how one ordinary man just broke<br />down one day.  EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|This was a great movie!  I have the other parts and wanted to add this one to my collection as well. This extended addition is just getting you ready and prepared for Part II.

B0052GACNM|5.0|This is a great product and im glad i can search down and buy things like this with confidence of online purchasing.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|My interest began with the HBO series, but being an avid reader, I had to read the book too. To me, the books make the shows so much better and fill in gaps not explained.<br />Either way, I have enjoyed Book One and look forward to #2 (though season 3 just began on HBO). Back to burning the midnight oil.

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|The endings seem to be to hurried and too many impossible escapes and rescues. I dont think jack would have ever made it to rescue the downed pilot. You can tell someone else is helping with the story line. I have now become a Vince Flynn fan. I will keep reading though.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|What a great show! Love the idea behind it and the setting. The story lines are awesome and the characters well played. You'll love to hate them, and will be cheering for the bad guy to make it alive!<br />A must see!

B0091REZMW|5.0|Not the most exciting hidden objects game I've played and it is irritating that I have to wait for energy to recharge.  I'm not sure how you get crystals except to purchase them and I'm not going to pay money for them.<br /><br />Update 8/27/13<br /><br />I am now totally hooked or maybe I should say addicted to this game.  Now that I'm at a higher level I rarely have to wait for recharge because I have charms to accelerate recharge and I also have several collections that will add experience. The recharging of diamonds is still a problem and I will confess that I have given in a few times and purchased diamonds when my friends weren't able to help me get out of a stuck situation.  I understand the developer needing to support the game but there really should be a way to earn diamonds. My only other complaint is that the game frequently force closes at the worst possible times.  Very aggravating.<br /><br />Another update<br /><br />I just bought a new Kindle, updating from the 1st Fire to the new 8\\" HD. I am having to start the game completely over losing my 300+ friends (most important because I have wonderful friends). I have not called support yet so hopefully this can be resolved through the cloud or something.  But so far love my new Kindle!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wow...where do I start with this review?  This book has gotten a lot of people talking about how bad/good it is.  I'm going to just come out and say it:  I really loved this book.  It did exactly what the author intended and that is to suck me right into the story and feel and experience everything that Abby was feeling.  So many emotional upheavals and I was right there for all of them.  I laughed, I cried, I got scared, and pissed off.  That's why I am giving this book 5 stars.  HOWEVER...I will agree with a lot of other reviewers out there that for real life, this is not a healthy relationship nor is it a good role model for young men & women.  Yes, the story ends up with what you think is a happily ever after, but come on...married at 19, in Vegas, and with \\"Mrs. Maddox\\" tattooed on her body (not knocking tattoos, I have a couple myself).  Does anyone really think that this relationship is going to go the distance?  Thinking of downloading Walking Disaster now to see this story from Travis' point of view.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|In a multi-hero film it is tough to do justice to each character. Yet, to the delight of movie lovers, Joss Whedon proves himself to be a superhero as he pulls off the impossible with fun, humor and unbelievable action in \\"The Avengers\\". This movie shows how you have to work as a team to get the job done. If you don't, then everything falls apart.<br /> The SHIELD director Nick Fury manages to assemble six superheroes when Loki threatens to destroy the Earth. Sadly, strong personalities don't make a good team and the superheroes fight with one another. It is only when everything seems lost, that the superheroes realize that alone they might be lost, confused souls, but together they become something they never thought they could become, the invincible Avengers.<br /> The film is so engaging that despite some flaws, you choose to ignore these. It is witty, smart and funny, with enough comic-book humor and elements of delight for everyone from somebody that's six years old all the way up to someone who's in their eighties. These are all the characters that we grew up loving, just in a different environment. If you don't know any of these heroes, its pretty easy to catch on and learn what their special powers are.<br /> So, everything you can imagine in a film with multiple superheroes is there. Great action, good costumes, witty writing, good subplots and most of all, the superheroes we've known for years fighting with or against one another is there in the film. I believe they could have thrown some different super heroes in that people knew more about, but I guess if they would have put Superman in it; then he would of handled the situation by himself. Some of the heroes I had never heard about, but when I started watching it I could pull out basic information on them.<br /> Not one character was given extra attention while giving enough time to establish the characters of the two who don't have a separate film yet, Black Widow and Hawk Eye. \\"The Avengers\\" was a surprising example of too much being put in one film, yet it worked out in the end. The length is just perfect; it didn't cut short or drag-on. Any shorter and it would not have done justice to the characters and any longer would have made it boring.<br /> Yet, you do miss a few elements while other things happen in the film. Thor just comes from nowhere and it doesn't give him a proper introduction. The Hulk, who so far we learned couldn't control his anger, in the climax of the movie he's friendly and helping everyone out. A little on how he got there, would have been better.<br /> The Avengers, is a watershed film because it is a new concept. It is the combination of multiple films; Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America. This also opens the door for future films. My guess is that there will be many sequels, where they bring in new superheroes to team up with or fight against.<br /> I see the main theme of this film to be brotherhood, what it is to work together for a common goal. A message for real life could be behind the movie idea, that our governments could do the same with the world. For even in real life, planet Earth is in desperate need of saving with no superheroes in sight.  Everybody wants change, but nobody wants to work together to get it.<br /> If you want to watch a movie about superheroes teaming up to same the world, then this is the movie for you.  The graphics and digital effects were futuristic. The film did a great job reflecting the characters the audience used to read about in comic-books. They threw a little bit of comedy in there, but all together it was an action-packed movie.

076421120X|5.0|Do you long for more of God's presence? Do you ache to see Him at work in your life? Do you desire His peace and rest? Renowned worship leader Darlene Zschech invites you to gather with her around the Word of God. Born out of her own yearnings that she poured onto the pages of journals, these meditations and Scriptures reveal Jesus and speak of His finished work-how He tenderly cares for you and wants you to know Him.<br />Honest, raw, and beautifully written, these devotions will inspire your journey and encourage you in every season. Come, sit at the feet of our Lord, be strengthened in your weakness, embrace His love for you, and breathe in His peace.<br /><br />Revealing Jesus:  A 365-Day Devotional is an absolutely beautiful hardback devotional book.  The Scriptures presented each day do not skip around haphazardly, but cover portions in the same book of the Bible for a number of days allowing the reader to grasp the whole counsel of God's Word in context.<br /><br />From Darlene's introduction to the devotional:<br /><br />  \\"Revealing Jesus came about after many conversations with friends and even more conversations with God...asking about the finished work of Christ and what victory the Bible declares is available to us in Jesus' name.  To say that I am desperate for the power of the cross and the power of the blood of Jesus to be worked out in greater measure in my life is an understatement.  His presence beckons me...So I pray you are fueled for service as you read, and that your hearts yearn for more of Jesus as you worship Him with every fiber of your being.\\"

B005HJU7HA|4.0|I hesitated between giving 3 and 4 stars here. I read this as a boy and remember loving them; but today ( age 67) they seem surprisingly flat, lacking in depth and detail. Of course each story is brief; they were published as episodes in a magazine after all. I had anticipated much more richness. They are almost more like comic strips, too brief, too formulaic.<br />No doubt my image was also colored by memories of the many Sherlocks from TV. Basil Rathbone is more my image; but Doyle's Sherlock is smaller. Rather than the commanding genius, Holmes' frailty and limitations are more prominent. His thinness, his thin fingers, his obsessiveness, his utter dependence on mental stimulation and the praise of others.<br />Of course this in some ways makes him more interesting; I am still in the process of reading the stories, and enjoying them. But at this point I don't know whether I will lose interest, or whether there will be enough development, enough surprises, or perhaps a growing fondness for the man, that I will continue.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|Average film, there are otehr films out there similar to this. Other ideas to the film or plays could have been added to it.
B003PJ6UHA|2.0|I keep hoping for the break-through book which will offer a genuine unification of physics and spirituality without doing violence to either, and I'm still waiting. Berman's explanation of perceptual consciousness was excellent, right on, and I started to get excited; but as he started to get into the quantum physics, he started to make some major philosophical blunders that I could not ignore (much as I wanted to). Basically he jumps from the (correct) idea that our actual experienced perceptions are manufactured in our brains, to the idea that reality as a whole is created there. That might be OK If he had addressed the problem of inter subjectivity at all (the fact that two different people can agree on what they see, but he didn't.  (Schrodinger suggests that there is only one consciousness, which appears to offer a way of dealing with that issue, but Berman just ignores it). Then he goes on to say some quite silly things about quantum physics, and lost me completely. Too bad, as his basic premise--that we need a radically new view of reality--I thoroughly buy. But Berman is not the one to bring it. We need someone who is enlightened (in the Buddhist sense), a neuroscientist, and a physicist; I'm trying, but I don't think I have enough time left.<br /><br />Pet peeve: for God's sake, if you are going to talk about quantum physics, be sure you know what you are talking about!!

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I'd heard quite a bit about this book before I started it, and to be honest, I was a bit concerned since the concept is downright gruesome.  However, I was quite surprised by the telling of this story.  I believe it's the innocent narration of five-year-old Jack that makes the whole thing bearable.  Room is one of the most interesting, intriguing books I've read this year.<br />The hero of the story (alongside young Jack that is), is his mother.  Because of her love and her extreme bravery, Ma makes this a story of triumph instead of hardship.  I greatly admired this young woman.  Her imagination and patience was far greater than anything I could have shown in such circumstances.<br />The author does a terrific job of capturing the thoughts and language of a five-year-old.  Especially a five-year-old who has been imprisoned his whole life.  Jack made me look at many things I take for granted in a new way.  He had a great amount of insight.<br />The person I disliked the most was Jack's grandmother who never was able to empathize (or even sympathize) with Jack and his mother.  She really annoyed me.  Not only did she not understand what Jack and his mother had been through, she didn't even seem to realize that Jack was only five years old.<br />I highly recommend this strange, compelling book.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|What can I say? You are either a fan or you are not. I have perused the graphic comic that the show is based on and I still like the direction the show is going... in season three I do have a problem that the undead tension has become secondary to the story- the actual zombies are just some kind of nuisance to be swatted like flies; earlier episodes had this sinister foreboding that was absolutely terrifying, and what we have now is just the politics of the living people... but really it is just as frightening.<br />Hanging on to humanity, the sense of what is right and wrong, defines this season.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I found this film to be similar in tone and execution to the original trilogy. The original trilogy was indeed a bit before my time, but I have seen them all several times.  A lot of fans were upset by this film and found it to be a little too far fetched. To those people I ask, have you seen the original three? I think so many of these fan boys have memories associated with the original films that they view them with the rose shaded glasses of nostalgia, and as such, no film will live up to their expectations. Having no real nostalgic connection to the original trilogy, I went into this movie without any nostalgia and fully expecting it to live up to the mystical and fictional aspects of the original trilogy and I was not disappointed. It is of course implausible, and the fridge nuking is a little much, but it is certainly isn't worthy of the criticism given to it by long time fans.  In fact Rotten Tomatoes has it as a certified fresh film. This movie is entertaining, and I don't know what more could be, or ever was asked of the Indiana Jones films.

0956721591|5.0|This is a classic book, an endearing story, presented in bilingual format for learners of French. Because of the excellent and fairly literal translation, the book is suitable for relative beginners and intermediate students alike.<br /><br />The audio recordings are clear and well-paced. The CD is an MP3 CD, and won't play on an old-fashioned regular CD-player, but are ideal for copying to an iPod, smartphone, laptop etc.<br /><br />Most interesting is the unique layout of the texts, that make following along in both languages together effortless.. a great idea. This saves a lot of searching around in the translation when you aren't sure of the meaning of a particular phrase or word, and makes study much more pleasurable.

B00BSBY38A|5.0|I finally read the book as the movie was going into general release, mostly to get up to date with the tide of interest I expected it to generate. After reading it, I found myself resisting seeing the movie because I couldn't imagine how it could be realized, including that I thought if they were faithful to the story it would be both gory and grim. With the awards it won and consistently strong word of mouth from people I trust, I decided to watch. I found myself with time last weekend and ordered it and was blown away. Incredibly beautiful, with saturated, lush, better-than-the-real-thing colors for both the land and sea shots. Because it captures both the spirit and faithfully tells the story it is one of the best adaptations of a novel I've ever seen. Because of the emphasis placed on an alternative path for the story, I even understood the novel in a different and deeper way. The experience stayed with me all the next day. Stunning!

0060090367|2.0|For spring break I wanted to dive into some light reading, so I ordered the first four books of Marian Keyes' Walsh Family series, each of which features one of five sisters raised in semi-wacky Dublin household by a pair of loving but somewhat eccentric parents. Watermelon also happens to be Keyes' first published novel -- published in Ireland in 1995 -- and it shows, including the breezy talent which made her a superstar of chick-lit, the shallowness of character common in that genre which she has successfully overcome, and a first-timer's fuzzy repetitiveness that leads to too-long books. The story features the eldest sister, Claire, who lives in London and opens on the day she gives birth to her first child, a daughter who whose father announces in the the delivery room that he's leaving Claire for another woman. Baby in tow, Claire heads home to Dublin, where her parents and sisters help her take care of her infant as she adjusts to life as an abandoned wife. In this novel the general Walsh family concerns are all very superficial: what's on the telly, what everyone's wearing, which man is Mr. Right? Obviously, Claire has some deeper concerns, but she spends most of the book obsessing over a younger man with a mystery who has entered her life. That overall superficiality and the fact that this book was published almost two decades ago are the main reasons this novel does not stand the test of time: the world has moved on, and so has Keyes' writing. Her 21st century novels featuring multiple viewpoint characters, such as This Charming Man and The Rest of the Story, are far superior and worth reading.

I strongly and highly recommend it.<br /><br />Evermore is stable, been around for a while and is so successful that it is safe to depend on it. Five Stars!
0060090383|3.0|Seven years after introducing the Walsh sisters in Watermelon, Marian Keyes in 2002 returned to the family with Rachel's Holiday, a much stronger novel but one that still shows significant flaws. Rachel is the middle sister, a 20-something living in New York with her best friend, obsessing about finding the right boyfriend with the right look, and succumbing to lure of alcohol, cocaine and prescription medication. After she turns up with a freshly-pumped stomach in an emergency room, her family whisks her back to Ireland for rehab. Although Rachel resists her diagnosis of addict, she agrees to sign in to the rehab of choice for Irish rock stars, figuring it will be glam and spa-like experience but finds out the hard way that treatment is no holiday. In this outing, Keyes has settled into her Walsh structure -- intercutting a now story focusing on the current crisis with a then story depicting the events leading up to the incident that kicks off the plot. Unfortunately, Rachel's then story of her descent into addiction is banal and uninteresting, and I found myself skipping those chapters. Pre-stomach pumping, Rachel is shallow young woman obsessed with trivialities and watching her crash and burn again and again is boring. Far more interesting is Keyes' depiction of the treatment regimen she undergoes and her fellow addicts and the myriad problems which led to their addiction. Keyes leavens the darker now story with her trademark humor but never pretends that Rachel's predicament isn't very serious. This turn to a more serious theme is what saved Keyes' career when chick-lit itself crashed and burned.

0312430000|4.0|My local library filed this as a book on health care, and a good deal of the discussion has to do with surgical and other medical issues, and hence some descriptions may be a tad unpleasant for some readers.  But the essential point is a good one, that in a complicated procedure it's possible to eliminate some very basic mistakes by instituting a checklist.  For me Dr. Gawande's most surprising point was that an effective system also enables lower-ranking people to point out trouble, which I know from my own professional pursuits to be particularly beneficial.  There are some passages that readers outside that professional community will want to skip over, but this is nonetheless a very worthwhile read.
0062103377|5.0|I purchased this book for some one that loves Bobby SInger. He loves this book. It came quickly. He said it was a good read for fans of Supernatural.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really nice update character really cool colors and great graphics very smooth I think love the keys and surviving the police looks funny
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|My daughter loves this and plays with it often.<br /><br />Its hard to go wrong with Legos, and it is good to<br />see animal related kits in addition to the science<br />and mechanical stuff...
0375869026|5.0|I purchased this book for two young teacher friends to help build their classroom libraries, and it was an excellent choice. Wonder is beautifully written for kids pre to early teens in their real world setting, and shows how different is just that - different, and there is goodness to be found in all if you take a moment to look. The book does not take the bully issue to task, but rather shows a kind act can open so many doors for all involved. I, as an adult, enjoyed reading it and think it would make an impression on any young mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This js an amazing game! I reccomend this to everyone who has enough time to plsy itbacause its ADDICTING!!!!! :D
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a good disturbing read but I didn't feel it was as good as the author's Gone Girl. It was an intriguing psychological mystery into the murders of 2 young girls of the characters home town. And this main character Camille certainly had her fair share of issues. There are a lot of drugs, sex and promiscuous young girls in the story. I now certainly understand the books description of WICKED above her hipbone...GIRL across her heart...NASTY on her kneecap.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is fun and I can play it all day. Me and my sister bet each other for the higher score.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book is fun, simple and easy to read. Even given that it is not as predictable as you would think. I would rate it at about an 8th level.  It could have been a little better edited.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and I have a serious crush on Jack Frost if I may say so myself.  I know kids will love this movie too so I plan to take it to summer camp with me and share it with my campers!  I think this is great for anyone who has any sort of fun in them.
B00B8PMWJI|5.0|In the past years there has been a lack of originality in the horror film genre. The ABDs of Death proves that there are still original and great film directors out there. I would not recommend this for kids but for adults who are fans of horror. this will definitely satisfy your senses. With so many different stories been projected there is something for everyone to enjoy.
B000OBYLVO|4.0|Just cute.  Would watch it again.  Could relate to many of the events personally.  Not a tear jerker.  Some tender moments.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Intense movie. Worthy of being Best Picture. In 3D, some of the scenes were astounding! I would definately recommend it.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Totally awesome book of greatness and awesomeness blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good book, great story told by a great man. Might jump around a little, but still an easy read. Thank you, each and every service member. R. I. P. Chris Kyle.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I very much enjoyed watching the first season (so far).  Oliver is a complicated character and Stephen Amell does a great job portraying him.  I am really rooting for him to save the city and have a happy life.
B007V65R54|4.0|To my admittedly untrained eye, Silver does a great job explaining probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian thinking. He presents the material clearly, and with numerous helpful examples. The real hat trick is that Silver manages to be very entertaining at the same time.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book,and would recommend it to anyone interested in probability, Bayesian thinking, or the limitations of our ability to predict and perceive reality.<br /><br />So, why not 5 stars?<br />I lack the confidence to rate anything perfect.<br />So:<br />Repent, ye frequentists, and ask Bayesian thinking into your lives!
0756697875|1.0|I am very disapointed because the lego batman minifigure was not included in the package.<br />That was the main reason why I have decided to buy this visual dictionary and now he did not have the minifigure.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Excellent story! Exceptional detail with good twists! A very good psychological thriller guaranteed to give you a few nightmares!  Addictive!
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|You feel like you are at the Concert instaed of watching a Historal event in spring of 1973. The largest audience in History to watch a performer was The King of Rock n' Roll ELVIS!!! Trim & Slim and Takin' Care of Business!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|OK, Mojang, Minecraft is my FAVORITE game ever, but Pocket Edition needs WAY more updates.  I have Minecraft on the PC and I play it every day, but Pocket Edition barely has any good stuff.  You can't even get Redstone or activate TNT.  You can't make any Redstone machines.  You can make a portal to the nether, but it's not the nether.  The nether in Pocket Edition is just a small room made out of obsidian, with about three zombie pigmen.  You can't use flint and steel, you can't make buckets, and you can't get Redstone or make anything Redstone related.  That's the stuff I'm most disappointed about.  I rated it half because I love Minecraft, but not Minecraft Pocket Edition.  I'd recommend Minecraft for the PC, but not Pocket Edition.
B00062PN6I|4.0|would have have it 5 stars but the ear cushion fell off on one side but it was pretty easy to put back on.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|That says it all. Thank God for the Stones. Nothing better. Never will be. Every song on these cd's is a classic
B004PAHZMC|3.0|My son loves legos and star wars so this was an easy pick.  The zippers are on both sides so it can be used as a mat.  He doesn't use it that way though.  He uses the carry case for storage and taking legos with him to Grandma's house.  The case is a little flimsy but works.  No other issues other than it doesn't hold a ton of legos.
0345529057|5.0|It's really wonderful, I love the quality of these books. it's really great. I recommend it to everyone. THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|A great match 3 game. Some levels are really hard but I am having fun trying for 3 stars. I have been playing for a couple of weeks and the entertainment value has not diminished at all.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I paid for this app for my Kindle fire. I have seen other apps where you can point it to the sky where you are, and it maps out in virtual sky where constallations are, where the sun and moon are, etc. This DOES NOT DO THAT at all.  In fact standing outside my house, sattelite cannot locate me.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I would like to say a lot about this movie but unfortunately rule #1 you cant talk about fight club.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is for lightning fast gamers.  On a tablet, you better have the touch screen set at super sensitive, or you are dying pretty quickly.
B001AXKXBW|5.0|This cd is an epic masterpiece from start to finish, a story told in song. This is Prog-rock at its finest.
0345803485|2.0|I bought this book due to all he hype. I found the writing to be amateur. I agree with everyone else that this book lacked a plot. I will not be purchasing the remaining two books.
0307913090|4.0|I saw the first episode of \\"Games of Thrones\\" on TV, and it left me cold.  So I tried to read the book, and couldn't get into it.  My last effort was the audiobook, and I LOVED it!  The descriptions of this new world and the colorful characters that inhabited it became my favorite guilty pleasure.  Best of all, it was brought to life by a very talented actor.<br /><br />That's the way I felt for the first 17 discs of the book (about 2/3's of it).  Then the violence came.  The detail that the author put into landscapes, clothing, and personalities, he put into gruesome torture and death.  With a film, I can close my eyes.  With a book, I can skip a few paragraphs.  But with an audio book, there's nothing I could do except listen.  That's why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5.<br /><br />I think I'll see enjoy the rest of the saga on TV.
B000002IZ4|5.0|This is a great CD - classic STP  - the best band!  Hard ass rock and roll as it was meant to be!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Mr Hall is superb  and supporting cast excellant.Writers leave you hanging anticipating nexr episode.<br /><br />Outstanding cable series I will hate to see go away.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|This is a great listen - great to have on when you're home fiddling about - the scenery is so gorgeous it makes you want to go find Eddie in Hawaii and live happily ever after :)
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|Madeleine channels Ray Charles. Interesting idea indeed, but for me it works. I fell in love with Madeleine's voice the moment I heard \\"Careless Love\\" and she remains one of two singers that can draw me to Barnes & Noble on new release day, Carly Simon being the other. Her music selection has floated here and there over the years but the voice remains absolutely the same. As does the presentation style, a fact that will turn some off and which may explain the presence of reviews ranging from one to five stars with several at each level.<br /><br />Madeleine isn't Ray Charles but she does her own thing with \\"Take These Chains...\\" and the other selections; she sure as heck isn't The Everley Brothers but she manages to make \\"Bye Bye, Love\\" sound like jazz instead of pop. If her style is low key and lacking in flash her voice is always clear and, to me at least, always pleasant. To be corny and steal a line from one of the Ray tracks \\"I Can't Stop Lovin' Her\\".<br /><br />There are times that I \\"guarantee\\" that a reader will like a given album or book but I'd be a fool to do that here. Madeleine is one of those girls that you either like or you don't. I have all of Madeleine's CDs including the wonderful but hard to find one with William Galison. If you're like me you already own this and I'm preaching to the choir. If you can't stand her, I disagree but I understand. But if you're in between and are curious I have some advice...do not start with \\"The Blue Room\\". Get \\"Careless Love\\", probably still the easiest disc to find and the closest to classic jazz, and go from there. If you fall in love like I did, great. If you're totally turned off, OK. But you MAY find yourself at any point in between. Two, three, or four stars...<br /><br />That's just Madeleine...
B000MNP2K8|5.0|This was a Christmas present for a friend since I already bought this DVD some time ago since he does not like Daniel Craig as 007 I wanted him to watch it so he can realize he's wrong.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This takes the cake.  Best read in ages.  Do yourself a favor this year at the beach. I loved it.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This was also a Christmas Present for a friend of mine who thinks Daniel Craig is too &#34;homely&#34; to be James Bond. (What's 007 supposed to look like?)
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This film expand our knowledge of dwarves and wizards, and connect the two books (Hobbit and LOTR) in the same universe. 3D version is not so awesome, but is nice.
1609611543|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews, I have to believe a lot of those people that didn't find this helpful is because they either don't understand it or don't want to implement necessary dietary changes to see this work.<br /><br />I've been slowly getting toward organics, cutting out processed foods, and trying to get healthier overall (including working out 3-4 days a week) - yet despite all these positive changes, I'm not losing weight like I thought. (I have about 90lbs to lose in total)  and now I know WHY!<br /><br />I've known the dangers of GMO wheat, corn, soy - but didn't realize wheat lurks in *SO MANY* other places.<br /><br />If you're having any problems with weight, allergies, abdominal distress.... give this book a try.<br /><br />I've just started implementing these principles - once I get further into it I'll post a follow-up review to let you know my progress!
B002WYH5N2|5.0|This is my new favorite movie.  The most wonderful love story.  It's a classic that will meet all your expectations.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This is a sturdy, yet light and comfortable backpack! I would strongly recommend this to anyone. Holds everything I need and more.
B002M9WW30|5.0|There isn't really much that needs saying about this. Rocky is one of my favorite movie franchises ever and now it's on Bluray. Win/Win
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app bcuz it is easy to use and it can be accessed from any device!  And you cannot beat free!
B00A85EMVK|5.0|An excellent choice to remaster this movie in 3D. The fighter jets pop out of the screen, makes this movie seem new all over again.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|I love her and I was so glad I found her she is so beautiful I could not believe it was so hard to find her.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is awesome because it shows what to expect for the week and what to expect the day is supposed to be like :)

0307383415|2.0|Makes me wonder if 2012 was the last presidential election the US will have? Couldn't really tell who his real fahter is!
B004S3X9ZS|5.0|One of my favourite albums by far. Amazing. Metronomy is a skilled and awesome band.  They are my favourite band.
B0082PQ8KQ|5.0|Should be a requirement in schools everywhere. Words can't describe how valuable a read this book would be to the world!  A vivid account of the most important person in medical research!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent reading great story ready to get on to the next book keep employees coming and keep them going  purely enjoyable
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Purchased as gift for someone else who is loves this type of music.  He listens to it every day especially when he is traveling. A great gift to buy for someone and great music to buy for yourself if you love the blues.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a sad funny comedy and this is a great book out of all the books I read this year
B002VXGW2E|5.0|This is a wonderfully good movie that is based on fact.  The biggest problem is the hunger that you will have for French food after about 30 minutes.  It is a love story, a story of the realities of life in a big city and also internationally, it is a story about a love of food, and a story that crosses generations (although it is NOT for children, there is some adult language that is used, for the most part, quite appropriately).<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Actually, this DVD was a birthday gift for my best friend.  But I have seen this production and the movie is gorgeous.  My favorite part is the time-lapse photography that shows the garden coming back to life.  I have read the book and this version of the movie seems to capture the spirit of the book the best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome minecraft pocket addition is the best game I have ever played and it is extremely worth it to buy it and it is a good price for it
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|I used to watch this movie when I was younger with my grandfather on a Sunday movie show that aired here in Chicago called &#34;Family Classics&#34; hosted by Frazier Thomas who was also the host of the telesvision show &#34;Garfield and Friends&#34;.  This movie always started the new fall season of Family Classics and I looked forward to watching it.  I now own this movie on blu-ray and I am looking forward to watching it in that format.  This was also a birthday present for my firend.
8498382378|3.0|TODO BIEN SIN COMPLICACIONES COMPLETO Y NUEVO EMPACADO....... . . . . . . . . . . . .
B00B23O96A|3.0|I was very excited to hear new music and have been a huge long time fan but, this is a little slow ,uninspiring and some songs are pretty crummy. I kept thinking, oh the next song will be better, but it wasn't. I will keep it because it's Clapton but I don't expect to listen to it often--maybe as I age it will grow on me??? It was kind of a bummer.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I like the easy to read teen books. This one is like a good story that keeps you interested and i am not a reader reader so you have to hold my interest in order for me to keep reading and this one certainly does. Get it and enjoy before you go watch the movie because you know the book will be better.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|These Pendergast novels are great.  What a fantastic main character! The other characters are interesting as well.  More, more more!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|I like this movie a lot. The kids had seen it at the movies and loved it the second time too. I would buy this if the price was right for sure.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was the best, longest adventure I've experienced, although it took me over a year to complete. I look forward to the next one.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Liked the action in the book...it moved along and there were moments I didn't want to put it down. I LIKE COUNTER TERRORISM and how CIA problems are solved...and I like Vince Flynn's method of writing.
B008FC4WA4|4.0|Sharp and Funny as usual. Too short though. Felt like wanting more.Great characters. Would love to see them more at lenght.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the best game ever. It is very fun and has a lot of animals from all of the ice age movies. I love this game you should try it and see what you think.
B005K17RU0|2.0|liked the old version better. only keeping this one because I don't like weatherbug. hard to just take a quick look at the current temp.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|There is something very authentic about the author's voice in this unique tale.  I loved it. The juxtaposition of the ordinary against the peculiar moves the story along.  It's a quick read, entertaining and, at times, quite thought-provoking.
B004478GNI|3.0|i got this set on sale a while back...i see that it's currently listed at around $40 and that is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />maybe that's because of low stock or some other factor, but that price is outrageous for this little set.<br /><br />this is the only recent star wars set that i've scrapped for parts for MOC's.<br /><br />the design is nice, but it's small for the price and compared with some other StarWars spaceships, its looks small and unremarkable.<br /><br />at its current price, only buy if you're a serious collector...otherwise wait for the Summer 2013 lineup that has some sweet looking sets.
0307951529|2.0|I would have been really upset if I would have had to pay for this book, thankfully I borrowed.  Took a class on Marketing 101 at the local Chamber of Commerce, and it is quite the same.  Find your passion/discover a need, target your market, \\"hustle\\" and make connections, work hard and deliver, obtain reward.  First, there is no list of ideas on what you can spend your money on to make it grow in this book.  Second, there is nothing new here.  What gets me is how many people keep falling for the same things, wasting time reading the same types of books over and over again.  We want to believe creating \\"information\\" leads to success.  Write e-books.  Blog.  Sit quietly and tap away at a computer.  None of these things are tangible or particularly unique, and there is a reason why there are only a few bloggers/e-authors that do phenominally well, vs. the tens of thousands that don't produce enough to eat.  There are only so many ways to produce fresh ideas - and this is again - just another rehashing.  I'm not going to say it was time wasted.  I am going to say that you only have to read one of these types of books.  If you have already read this type of book in the recent past - it's time to stop reading and to act on your hobby/passion.  Reading these books only makes them money, not you.
0345529057|5.0|Quite possibly some of the best written books in our generation. A must read. You cannot put the books down.<br /><br />On the last book now and still loving it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son and i just could not put this down.  Highly entertaining and addicting.  A must have for anyone in the tri-state area.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|The new graphics are nice. I think the shark is easier to control and definitely stays alive longer since the other sharks don't eat your fish. In fact, it is a little too easy now. You used to have to work for your fish but now just swim near, open your mouth and fish are sucked in like it's a shark vacuum. People will actually come back to the waterline to be eaten. It is all a little too easy but it is fun.<br /><br />I do like the coins and upgrades. Changing sharks to reach new areas is a nice bonus.
B00BVMXBVG|4.0|NO SPOILERS:<br /><br />BBC America hit a home run with \\"Copper\\" and had a strong showing with \\"Ripper\\".  Both were historical period pieces.  Orphan Black wraps a mystery around cloning.  The BBC is going a long way towards making a claim to be at top in the program originality department<br /><br />So far the casting pool doesn't appear to overly deep with Tatiana Maslany doing all the heavy lifting as Sarah Manning and her clones Elizabeth Childs/Alison Hendrix/Katja Obinger/Cosima<br /><br />Before I cast judgment on the writing I would like to see a few more episodes and plot direction.  However, so far I like the direction.  There are some comic lines worked in with the serious nature of the mystery (hence the comment by Beth's BF on her attire)<br /><br />As for Tatiana Maslany, I was a fan before Orphan Black.  I thought that she actually carried Mark Harmon with her portrayal of contract killer Clara Rinkle in the telemovie of John Sandford's \\"Certain Prey\\"<br /><br />I generally like to watch a few more episodes before I submit a review and Orphan Black is subject to an upgrade (or downgrade) depending on how the series progresses.  However, I wanted to come out early with a recommendation to at the very least give the show (and Tatiana Maslany) a chance
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game that grows as you play. The only down side is it grows slowly unless you are willing to pay extra.
B0058W74UY|1.0|This app failed to play any of the flash games I have on my device - it just shows a black screen. However it does come with AirPush, which is adware that distributes your personal information (phone #, email, and which apps you install) to advertisers.<br /><br />Also, just to be clear, this app is not intended to add flash support to your internet browser. It is only for playing .swf files stored on your device, e.g. files that you received in an email or transferred from your PC.<br /><br />I wish I had read the reviews before downloading. Oh well, at least its free.
B005LAII44|4.0|I GREW UP TO GI JOE, SO I WAS VERY CRITICAL OF BOTH FILMS, BUT I REALIZED ITS A NEW TAKE ON GI JOE FOR THE KIDS OF THIS GENERATION, SO YOU TAKE IT FOR WHAT ITS WORTH, I THOUGHT THE 1ST ONE WAS OK BECAUSE OF STORM SHADOW, GEN. HAWK & SNAKE EYES, BUT GI JOE RETALIATION IS FAR BETTER, ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT FLINT SHOULD OUT RANK ROADBLOCK LIKE IN THE SERIES, THE BLACK LEADERS OF GI JOE WERE STALKER & ALPINE, BUT ITS COOL, THE MOVIE WAS GREAT FUN, I REALLY ENJOYED COBRA COMMANDER, WHO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE VILLIANS NEXT TO DR. DOOM, SKELETOR, DOC OCK, GEN. WARHAWK, DARKSIED & MING, I JUST WISH DESTRO HAD'NT OF GOT BLOWN UP IN THE PRISON BREAK, THAT I COULD'NT UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE HE IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF HOW COBRA MANUFACTURE'S THEIR WEAPONRY,BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS, THE PLOT WAS DECENT BUT SCATTERED, I ENJOYED THE FIGHT SCENES, DEWAYNE \\"THE ROCK\\" JOHNSON WAS GOOD AS ROADBLOCK, OH, & TO THE CRITIC WHO SAID DEWAYNE \\"THE ROCK\\" JOHNSON IS WHITE, YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT RACE, THE ROCK'S DAD IS BLACK & HIS MOM IS SOMOAN & SHE LOOKS BLACK ALSO, LIKE MOST SOMOAN'S DO, ME & THE ROCK HAVE THE SAME SKIN COMPLEXION, & I'M BLACK, BUT ANYWAY, MOST OF THE CASTING WAS COOL & IF YOUR A KID WHO DOES'NT KNOW ABOUT GI JOE, YOU'LL LOVE IT, BUT IF YOU GREW UP TO IT IN THE 80S & EARLY 90S, YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Don't pay attention to the name of the cd.  It's fantastic music from a real talent.  I'd buy this for friends, relatives, and anyone needing a pick me up.

0802473156|5.0|The bottom line is all couples have good times & bad times. This short book gives simple practical advice on how to meet the challenges you will face in your relationships. Sometimes we are mean to our spouse/partner/S.O. This book gives examples on how to correct your own behavior and how to deal with the behavior of the ones we love but can not control. Some of the advice may not be for everyone but it is clear who the advice is intended for. We all really have 5 Love Languages, perhaps a combination of more than one but after reading this you will learn how to communicate better with your loved one. Highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun!!! I recommend this game to all ages it is better than one with more than multiple different playing opptions.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|a great way to save your docs.,your secrets, well ANYTHING!!! I highly recomend this app to everyone!!!<br />You should toatly get this!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The age range at my house of 8 is 6-45.<br />Everyone loved it. Good plot, clean, funny, drama, suspense, romance, it's got it all.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I'm an American history fan who loves Lincoln, but I find Spielberg and Lewis's interpretation of Lincoln to be sadly lacking. Perhaps they should have paid more attention in school and to the facts.
B002APU580|5.0|I never read Jane Austin's book, but after seeing the movie, I will definitely do so.  Keira was perfect for the role & the other cast members were very memorable.
0385349947|5.0|Having read and heard all of the hoo-hah in the media regarding this book, I was a bit skeptical. However, when I saw Sheryl Sandberg interviewed on CBS, her manner and way of speaking to the subject of the book really drew me in. So I purchased the book and dove in head first.<br /><br />I must say that many of the people who &#34;reviewed&#34; the book or spoke negatively about it must not have actually read all the way through the book. Some of the larger complaints about Sheryl's story were:<br />1. How can she be speaking to all women when most women do not have the luxury of her resources?<br />2. Not every woman wants to be COO (or CEO, etc.) so how does this apply? (Sheryl is COO of Facebook)<br /><br />Sheryl clearly addresses these two chief compaints early and often. In fact what she says is that she KNOWS that not all women are as fortunate financially as she and her husband, &#34;leaning in&#34; can occur in any industry, at any level. It can also occur at home, in the PTA, and in any other charitable endeavours that one is engaged in.<br /><br />In addition, the author is quick to share her own &#34;mea culpas&#34; as well as those of other women she knows and has worked with. This helps to illustrate the broad based nature of what she describes as women's &#34;failings&#34; to lean into their careers, their relationships, and their lives. It is certainly not that we are failures, but rather that if we want to continue to see change in the workplace (and at home, and in our volunteer work) we need to BE the change that we want to SEE. We do need to sit at the table we are invited to, and when we are not invited, perhaps we need to invite ourselves.<br /><br />Having been in business for many years, I can absolutely see the validity of what Sheryl presents here, and am sorry to admit that there have been times where I wished I had &#34;leaned in&#34; earlier and more often. I unfortuantely also see quite clearly that when women exhibit certain characteristics, we are looked down upon because &#34;good girls don't...(fill in the blank)&#34;. I have experienced this myself as a woman with opinions that I am not shy to express. Thankfully, I have also learned through trial and (much) error to temper myself, to try to remain relentlessly pleasant, and to play the game. The sooner we realize that business is a game, and that there are written and unwritten rules of engagement, the sooner we as women are more likely to win and continue to move ahead as far as we would like.<br /><br />I am recommending this to most of the women I work with, to the women who are my close friends, and to my sisters and neices. I would say that before you experience &#34;contempt prior to investigation&#34; buy the book and read it for yourself.
0525478817|5.0|Disclaimer: This review may contain a few spoilers. The biggest spoiler is acknowledged as \\"SPOILER ALERT.\\"<br /><br />Hazel is a sixteen year old girl who has terminal cancer. Even though she is sick, and has to walk around with an oxygen tank, she doesn't let the cancer define her. Since she was homeschooled, Hazel has already taken, and passed, the GED and is enrolled in college literature classes. Hazel's favorite book is An Imperial Affliction, by Peter Van Houten, and loves to read poetry, but not write it.<br /><br />Lacking a social life, besides attending college classes, Hazel's parents urge her to go to a cancer support group held at a local church. At the support group, she meets Augustus, former high school basketball player whose cancer is in remission. Gus, as he is so often called, is attending a meeting with his friend, Isaac, who is about to have eye surgery, which will result in blindness.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus form a bond that can only be found within a true friendship. They read each other's favorite books, play video games together, and speak to each other in metaphors. Although Hazel has more than friendship feelings for Gus, she is scared to get close to him because she doesn't want to hurt him with her illness. Gus, on the other hand, has been hurt before and is willing to take the risk because he cares so deeply about Hazel. Together, they laugh, cry, and fill each other's lives with companionship.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is devastatingly beautiful. Even though cancer is as far from a funny subject as it can get, John Green makes it seem as if it's just another fact of life, and makes jokes that don't seem awkward or insensitive. The true love and friendship found within the characters of this novel are a rare find. I have read many fictional books about cancer, but this one is different, this one is special. Cancer is scary: for those who have it, had it, or watched someone struggle through it. John Green paints a real picture, he doesn't sugar-coat it. Not only was he able to create such an exceptional story-line for Hazel and Augustus, he was also able to put a story within a story by incorporating An Imperial Affliction, by Peter Van Houten, into so many aspects of this book.<br /><br />An Imperial Affliction, Hazel's favorite book, is not a real book; I know this because I googled it. In the made-up novel, Anna, the main character, is diagnosed with a rare blood disease. Her mother meets a Dutch man who says that he can help Anna with a special cancer treatment. Not only does he promise to help Anna, but her mother also falls in love with him. The novel ends in the middle of the sentence, leaving the reader (especially Hazel) angry and confused.<br /><br />Hazel considers Peter Van Houten one of her best friends, even though they have never met, because she thinks he knows what death is like, even though he hasn't died yet. I love how Hazel is so invested in this story and its characters.  I also love that Augustus begins to share her passion for the story and together they try to find out what happens to Anna's mother, the man her mother loves, and Anna's hamster. I'm not going to lie, I am kind of disappointed that I can't read this novel, it sounds so inspirational.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: My favorite part of  The Fault in Our Stars is when Hazel and Gus go to Amsterdam together, with the use of his wish,  to meet Peter Van Houten, but I hate that he is a rude, old man. I love that they go on a date and drink champagne and are able to experience young love the way it's meant to be experienced. I also love that they visit the Anne Frank House, a place on my bucket list, where they share their first kiss.<br /><br />Just as Hazel was upset with the ending of the An Imperial Affliction, I was also upset with the ending of The Fault in Our Stars. I don't know what it is with me lately, but books have been pissing me off when they end. Just like Hazel, I want more.I was also (and still am) upset about the ending of The Diary of Anne Frank (yes, I knew she was going to die, but I didn't know it was going to just END.) But, as I have come to learn, if a book leaves you wanting more, then the author must have done a good job (except in Anne Frank's case, it just wasn't her fault, and I'm sure she wishes she could have given us more.) John Green did better than good when he wrote The Fault in Our Stars, he did great.I was also (and still am) upset about the ending of The Diary of Anne Frank (yes, I knew she was going to die, but I didn't know it was going to just END.)

B00AFROVQC|2.0|I can't believe anyone compared this to Lord of the Rings or any other classic Fantasy literature.  It may have the basis for an engaging story, but the writing is poor and simplistic.  The narrative is contradictory in numerous places.  I do not recommend this book

B00B2166BS|5.0|This is a solid cable and it makes charging your nexus 10 more of a breeze. Does it actually charge my nexus 10 faster? I would say yes although I havent truly tested that point, it is barely a noticeable change. But as far as being an easier way to charge the nexus - of that there is no doubt.

B009G78EE2|5.0|To be honest I bought this cuz of the song we all should know by now - Thrift shop. Also, the price point was hard to pass up. I listened to the whole album and I feel pretty comfortable vouching for it. This guy really is talented, has a lot to say, and doesnt curse every other word like most others. Check it out! For $4, it was easy to give this unsigned artist a chance.

B0094WK9EC|5.0|Great beat, and mixed well, Absolutely love it,  Sounds great on my JBL system turned up, I can feel the music!
B000000OU0|4.0|Well, its not the Eagles as you might remember them, but still quite good.  Its mostly solo work performed as a group and rework of old classics.  But the acoustic version of Hotel California might be worth the price on its own.  While I miss the electric guitar solos, this live performance and the acoustic accompaniment seem to just fit.  While I will probably listen to the originals more often, this album will likely get a listen now and again and I am glad its in my collection.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I had long ago completely given up on Hollywood; they have shown me, through their insistence on releasing nothing but remakes and sequels (whose only appeal is that they have sacrificed any semblance of acting or directing for bigger explosions; more over-the-top stunts; less believable plots and an endless supply of here today, gone tomorrow, flash-in-the-pan, fifteen-minutes-of-fame hotties and hunks), that Hollywood has completely run out of any new ideas.  I cannot remember the last time I thought anyone in Hollywood made something important (it was probably &#34;Big Fish&#34;).<br /><br />Where then does one look if one craves substance?  Well, the only place to find believable writing, inspired acting and directing which will not insult our intelligence is on premium cable: HBO, Starz and Showtime.<br /><br />With that in mind, Game of Thrones is easily the greatest production in film or television in existence today (so great in fact, I recently saw an episode of &#34;Around the Horn&#34; that was Game of Thrones-themed).<br /><br />To create true greatness, one should start by locating existing greatness: George R. R. Martin's &#34;Song of Ice and Fire&#34; series.  In this case, the author has already created a fantasy world (which although it includes dragons and some magic is still believable) and a cast of memorable characters, every one of whom is important in an unfolding timeline of earth-shattering events, brought about by an endless webs of lies, schemes and secret alliances.  All we must do then is to avoid screwing up what so many already love is show reverence for the work in our writing and casting.<br /><br />Next, we should surround ourselves with actors of merit, not simply pretty faces or chiseled abs.  The most notable of these is our lead:  Sean Bean, who is so perfect as Ned Stark it is as though the author had been imagining him as he wrote his novels.  Peter Dinklage as Tyrion is also at the top of the list (although this is revealed more in season two), giving a performance that truly embodies the duality of the character: the libertine and the genius politician.<br /><br />Finally, once we have assembled the players, we must allow them to do what they do best; and if there is substance in the work, it will shine through in their performances.<br /><br />We do not demean our audience.  When we are faithful and allow greatness to shine, we enrich all who experience it; we restore hope and trust to an industry that has betrayed us so many times for something so fleeting as money and fame.<br /><br />True greatness, like true beauty, endures.ore in season two), giving a performance that truly embodies the duality of the character: the libertine and the genius politician.<br /><br />Finally, once we have assembled the players, we must allow them to do what they do best; and if there is substance in the work, it will shine through in their performances.<br /><br />We do not demean our audience.

B000002H4C|4.0|I am still enjoying this selection. I saw this movie, thus heard the soundtrack back in 1985, but saw it again in January 2013. My only regret is that i spent that many years with out it in my collection.

B007HC3LHS|3.0|This book started off very very slowly, I even considered not finishing it. It wasn't until a little bit more than half way through that the plot really began to develop and the story became more exciting. It was an easy read, it was pretty exciting and interesting at times, but it's definitely not one of the best books I've ever read.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|Really great music from series one a must have for Doctor Who fans. Exciting music and inspiring.  Great CD to get.
1607053888|5.0|I actually found this book at Joann's instead of the other dozen or two books I have purchased through Amazon. They are great books but I really, really love this one!!! I am a beginner and have no clue what I am doing. The purses are very modern and trendy. They range from shoulder bags to clutches and wristlets and market bags. The variety was different, not the same style or two with different fabric.  What I truly loved about this book were the pictures!!! I started a purse from another book and was stumped as to what I was supposed to do next or if I even had anything right up to where I was.  This book doesn't have picture drawings but photographs at the major parts that I needed. Comparing similar bags and their photographs told me I wasn't too far off....seeing is is the first purse I ever attempted to make and my only other experience with sewing was a beginner's class and I made an envelope pillow!!! Wish I had found this book first out of all my sewing books!!! I hope this author has more books!!!!
0142419400|5.0|I think Stephanie Perkins just became one my favorite authors. Anna and the French Kiss was nothing short of amazing. I didn't want to put the book down and when I absolutely had to, I became aggravated and vile... Sorry kids.<br />Anna and the French Kiss is hard to summarize because the plot is simple: Anna is sent to Paris to attend her senior year at a boarding school. She is upset to be ripped away from her friends back home and made to live in a place where she doesn't even speak the language, no matter how beautiful Paris is. She is relieved when she is befriended immediately by her dorm neighbor, Meredith, and accepted by Mer's group of friends. It isn't Meredith or the others who truly make her feel as if she belongs, but Etienne St. Clare; a beautiful boy with an acute British accent.<br />The only problem is St. Clare is in a serious relationship with Ellie, and he's been with her for over a year. Anna is determined to not fall for Etienne... or at least pretend she feels nothing for the gorgeous boy who makes her laugh and who is fastly becoming her very best friend.<br />There are really no words I can say to convey how wonderful this book is. I loved it! I want to reread it! I am having a hard time reading another book because Anna and Etienne's story is that EPIC for me. I can't wait to read Lola and the Boy Next Door because I am convinced that Stephanie Perkins is incapable of creating anything less than brilliant.

1476719071|4.0|I actually really liked Beautiful Disaster. The synopsis intrigued me and, despite some of the ratings this book recieved due to unprofessional behavior on the authors part, I couldn't allow the drama of it all to deter me from reading a book that I knew I would like, if not love. The characters were well-rounded, though ridiculous at times. Abby and Travis' relationship seemed real to me. Travis has major issues, but there are many younger adults who are messed up, who do not know how to deal with their feelings and have jealousy issues. However, Travis acted borderline psychotic and I felt as if Abby enabled his behavior more times than not, which did nothing for Travis' growth.<br />I took a star away for all the freaking pet names and the shortening of names and the overuse of names in general. I found myself skipping the freaking names just so I could take the characters seriously. Note to the author: when you are speaking to someone, you do not end or start every other sentence with their name, do you? Trav, Mare, Shep, Pidge... Pidgeon? I thought that was a cute name at first, but it should have been a term of endearment used only in intimate scenes, in my opinion. I found myself sighing in relief the few times, I think it was two, that Travis actually used Abby's name... that is just backwards. Haha<br />And, I also have to point out that most men, \\"most\\" being the operative word, are too prideful to back down from another man just because he is a fighter and will most-likley obliterate them. I found it comical that every single guy Travis turned his death glare on backed down. That would never happen. In the real world he'd have been jumped by all those frat boys he intimidated.<br />Overall, Beautiful Disaster was a good read. It kept me up at night and my thoughts were intertwined within the pages even when I wasn't reading. I am a lover of chaos (only in my books) and Beautiful Disaster had plenty of it, hence the title. I am looking forward to reading other titles by this author.<br />UPDATE<br />Okay, so I researched a bit and found out why this author, Jamie McGuire, has such a bad reputation. I still stick with my original rating because I truly did enjoy Beautiful Disaster. It's like saying you didn't enjoy natural Born Killers because it promoted bad behavior. Haha! As I mentioned earlier to a Goodreads friend, I truly hope that Ms. McGuire has learned her lesson regarding responding to negative reviews and the professionalism of an author. I also hope that this book no longer is viewed as YA, but New Adult.<br />However, everyone is human and makes mistakes. There are authors out there that make the mistake of becoming involved in conversations with reviewers who didn't care for their work and the outcome is never good. I totally thought that Abby and Travis' relationship set a bad example for young girls, but I am not a young girl and I enjoyed all the dysfunction. I am not sure what that says about me, but at least I am honest. I also have an 11 year old daughter and would never allow her to read this book until she was mature enough, like 18.<br />If girls read this and think Travis is the kind of boy they would like to date, it isn't the author that has put that thought into their heads, but their current lifestyle and circumstance. I wasn't attracted to Travis' character in the least, but I felt for him and wanted him to mellow out and get some help; his behavior and his and Abby's frienship is what made me read on.ther titles by this author.<br />UPDATE<br />Okay, so I researched a bit and found out why this author, Jamie McGuire, has such a bad reputation.

0143038583|5.0|In Part II of The Omnivore's Dilemma book, Michael Pollan takes a look at world geographical history with regards to the foods societies choose to eat.  He is on a mission to find out, from planting a seed on a farm, to the actual growth, the steps of production and delivery.  Today, as world societies choose to confront what supermarkets and fast food chains options are provided to us the consumer, most realize the impact of the food choices which affect their overall health, the environment, and possibly changing the way choices are made for daily meals. The Omnivore's Dilemma is an eye opening, thought provoking exploration of the dimensions of eating and the choices of Industrial Foods, Organic Foods, and finally the old-fashioned way of hunting, gathering, and gardening.<br />According to The Penguin Press (2006), \\"Early in the afternoon on the first day of summer, Michael Pollan found himself sitting in the middle of an impossibly green pasture on \\"Polyface Farm\\", in the Shenandoah Valley, resting.\\" (p. 125).  This is the location that Pollan chose to do his 7-day research, and experience first-hand the foods we eat, where they come from, and how they are grown. Pollan contacted a man by the name of Joel Salatin to work for seven days on his farm and this book reveals lessons learned, and most importantly, Pollan has a new appreciation for organically grown foods, farmers and their work load concerning farmland. What is organic anyway?  \\"The word organic has proved to be one of the most powerful words in the supermarket, without any help form the government.  Farmers and consumers working together in this way have built an 11 billion dollar industry that is now the fastest growing sector of the food economy.  We don't follow the food you buy back to the farm; we rely on certifiers and label writers.\\" (The Penguin Press.  2006. p. 138). Organic examples include raw milk, grass-fed beef, pastured chicken and eggs, wild pork, local vegetables, raw-milk cow cheeses, and homemade breads. Common questions to ask if you want to know if the food you buy is organic include:<br />* How do you raise your animals?<br />* Are your cows grass-fed? Do you practice rotational grazing? How often do they get moved?<br />* What do you feed your animals? Is all your feed GMO-free?<br />* Milk - Do you pasteurize? Do you give the cows any grains?<br />* Are your egg-layers free range? Are they in a portable house on pasture, or a stationary house? What do you feed them? How often do you move the portable house?<br />* Are your broilers on pasture? Do you process them yourself or take them somewhere? What do you feed them? How often do you move them?<br />I enjoyed the author's narrative strategy as he traces four meals back to their history.<br />He concludes each section: quite interestingly summing up his experiences for all three different parts of his book:<br />1.  Sitting down to a meal at McDonalds (Part I).<br />2.  At home with his family sharing a meal from whole foods (Part II).<br />3.  In a revolutionary \\"beyond Organic\\" farm in Virginia, a meal prepared (Part III).<br />All three parts are written in a clear, informative prose, entertaining each of the readers with his senses, adventuress and comedy tone of voice. In the end of reading part II, I felt that he wanted to convince all of the readers the reality of choosing to change the way we eat but also educating ourselves to the reality of what we choose to buy for our health.<br />Mr. Pollan paints us all a picture of the reality of eating organic chosen foods or the multi- billion dollar unhealthy food like McDonalds for our health in Part II.  Pollan treated his own family to an industrial organic meal using items bought entirely from his local Whole Foods from the \\"free range\\" chicken from Petaluma Farms (Rosie), vegetables marketed by Cal-Organic, organic asparagus flown in from Argentina, salad mix from Earthbound Farms, and a dessert consisting of organic vanilla ice cream and organic berries imported from Mexico.<br />As Pollan closes his mission he attempts to make comparisons between his industrial organic meal and the same meal had it been conventionally grown or raised. Although Federal regulations do not make health distinctions between industrial organic foods and conventional foods, there is growing scientific research that suggests that some organic foods have higher nutritional values than their conventional equivalents.  When it comes to produce, organic food is safe for the environment, since synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides are not used. And yet, as Mr. Pollan points out, the amount of fossil fuel used to get a meal from the farm to his kitchen is comparable to the amount for a conventional meal, since the vast majority of the energy footprint is due to the processing and shipping of the food. In the end as a consumer of McDonald's choice of eating those who do will now contemplate and actually start to care about their food's taste, health and environmental cost.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Pollan, M.

0307474259|5.0|After reading this book, I frankly do not feel that calling it a \\"revelation\\" is exaggerating. It WAS a revelation--a complete shattering of my previous understanding of what made people fat. I found out about the book by listening to Gary be interviewed on the podcast Skeptically Speaking (I think)...and feeling like what he was saying simply couldn't be true. I went ahead and bought the book totally expecting to find massive errors, cherry picked data, fictitious finding, and pure anecdotes presented as fact. Boy was I wrong....What Gary has done with this book is extraordinary. He has meticulously exposed the 2 big lies at the heart of current nutritional standards and thinking: that \\"calories in - calories out\\" explains excess fat accumulation and fat loss, and secondly that the consumption of fats (especially saturated) makes us fat and causes heart disease. These two pernicious myths have resulted in nutritional guidelines and widespread beliefs about what constitutes a \\"healthy diet\\" among the population at large that have proven to be abject failures. In fact, metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, cancer and a host of other diseases began to explode at the very same time that the authorities convinced everyone that a healthy diet was extremely low in fat, low in meat, and high in carbohydrates and sugar (so-called \\"heart healthy\\" whole grains, etc.)<br /><br />I would suggest the reader to read the book twice, and re-read chapters several times in order to break through from the brain-washing we've all grown up with--because at times the truths that Gary lays out in this superbly well-researched book will be subconsciously fought by the years of non-reality based propaganda that is so ingrained in our brains. By the end however, it will be so clear that everything we've ever been told has been wrong and more importantly has been the cause of countless deaths and misery for so many millions of people who have been led to believe that they are fat because they are weak-willed gluttons who are lazy. Obesity is not a disorder of the mind. Obesity is a disorder of the biological processes regulate fat accumulation, and said processes are entirely controlled by hormones in our body--with insulin being THE main driving force in both fat accumulation and in fat loss.<br /><br />Gary has started a revolution--if the low carb craze of 10 years ago had been accompanied by this book and the efforts to fight the bad science peddled by nutritionists and by a myriad of incompetent scientists and allies of the cause, we may not be talking about it as just another fad. This time around the pushback that has began starting with Gary's New York Times Magazine piece \\"What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie,\\" \\"Good Calories Bad Calories,\\" \\"Why We Get Fat,\\" Dr. Robert Lustig's (scientifically based) war on sugar, and the founding of The Nutrition Science Initiative is the sort of pushback that will finally break us free of the outright criminal nutritional advice that brainwashed an entire country into getting fatter than ever before all the while making us believe we were eating the healthiest way possible. It may take many many more years to destroy the conventional widsom on nutrition once and for all--but for the first time in a long time the forces pushing back hard against it are not giving up and are gaining momentum. Start by buying this book and having your eyes be opened--and should you be in need of losing weight, to finally get a science-based answer as to why you ended up overweight and a near-fullproof way of fighting it that does not involve semi-starvation and useless (if not) counterproductive hours spent at the gym.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I like this game a lot the pony problem is that it goes way to fast and that is why I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game - it's a great way to pass the time, and the missions add a little challenge.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Arcade classic that gets you hooked and available whenever you need it on your phone. Lengthy and challenging the father you get
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I wish the series had continued.<br /><br />The movie answered a lot of questions that had developed throughout the series.<br /><br />It is worth seeing if you like sci-fi or Nathan Fillion

B004SIP9RO|5.0|I just love this movie. It shows that chasing your dreams can be made into something realistic. I watched it with my dad and I have to say, he was very silent through out the movie. And that was a god thing. HE liked it so it gets an awesome 5 stars.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is awesome you should count on me so give it a five star rating. Please take my word for it and give it a five star or four star rating please.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Wife loved seeing the move again, didn't even realize it was free for Prime members. Not sure why there is a minimum amount of words required for a review, so I am writing this.
B00456PKG4|5.0|Watched this movie 4x. I wish there's a sequel. Jake Gyllenhaal is soo sexy and a good actor. I wish he would do more of this.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|A fan of historical dramas, I rented this based on the four star rating after I watched the trailer and saw the rave reviews from critics.<br /><br />I won't pretend to be some sort of industry expert, but something went really wrong making this film, or maybe it was in editing this film. Disappointed in every way possible. Maybe it tried to cover too much history and lost much of it's integrity along the way. Fragmented is how it felt.<br /><br />I had to watch many scenes over as I had no idea who was who, or who was doing what with whom or to whom. Mass confusion. The dialogue just seemed to go on and on without any point or closure. Often I could not decipher the words being spoken, many of the actors seem to mumble the last half their sentences. No outstanding performances by any actor or actress. They were not bad performances, I'm just saying 'not outstanding'.<br /><br />My best guess: this is a film for those who are big civil war buffs and that's fine.
B009AMANBA|4.0|\\"Lincoln\\" is a very fine film.  It is well acted and directed, the music serves the film well, the cinematography and the locations are excellent, and the source material is first rate.<br />But the title is misleading, since the film is not about the life of the 16th president of the United States of America, nor is it an overview of his presidency, but about the fight for the passing of the 13th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<br />It is interesting that this film comes out at this moment in time, when traditional marriage between a man and a woman is under attack, and the proponents of same-sex marriage want to redefine the concept of marriage.  It seems to me that it isn't serendipity, but a well calculated plan to equate the just fight for equality under the law regardless of ethnicity with the the fight for the re-definition of marriage, under the guise of discrimination of homosexuals in their pursuit of happiness.  If that was the intention of \\"Lincoln\\", then it is an intellectually dishonest masterpiece.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|If I could have given this three and a half, I would have. I have been turned off of comedies for a few years now; they just aren't funny any more, and what's more, they imply that most people have the intelligence of a chimp and are bowled over by bathroom humor (no pun intended). This movie, at least, had a plot, enjoyable music, and talent. I had to overlook the burrito-throwing and the vomit &#34;humor&#34;, but for the most part the movie was entertaining and I think for the music alone it was worth watching.
B004NDVK1I|5.0|Rory Gallagher was a remarkable musician & this album is an excellent representation of his music.  Gave the album to my brother and he loved it.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|I've only used the charger a couple of times and it seems to work just fine.  The only problem I have is that it is not easy putting it in to charge.  It is a very tight fit and takes more force than I would expect to insert it.  But I won't complain too much because it works.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I'm the kind of person who needs &#34;removable storage&#34; for my brain.  I need one place to put a grocery list, record of books I've read and want to read, important dates, my medications, list of errands, and stuff I want to think about later.  Other notebook apps were complicated to learn and/or designed for people with complicated needs. I've been using Notebooks for about a month now and am very satisfied.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Relatively short but sweet game. Reminiscent of old school adventure games. Lots of fun. Although it's short, it's engrossing. Enjoy~

B0091REZMW|1.0|Although this game is free, in order to keep playing it at a decent level, you have to buy credits with REAL cash. Not very user friendly. Advancing is difficult and limiting due to the cash thing.
0385349947|5.0|The first book I have read that offers concrete changes you can make to help break your own glass ceiling.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Although I haven't finished this first installment, I find it totally engrossing. Good graphics with an excellent story line. Quite reminiscent of Myst! Wish there wee more games like this.
B005MXQD5Q|5.0|One of my favorite pop musicians/singers.  This recording does Cohen justice, with excellent recordings of the sound, and good photography.

1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 was the first Stephen King book I've read and it was just a wonderful read. I cannot recommend the book enough... it has a great pulpy hook that is thought provoking but it has great characters and it is just a lot of fun to read. More than a time travel book its a love story... and a great one at that. I was close to tears towards the end of the novel. Don't read too much and buy the book. Its worth every cent and while the length may be daunting... its a fast read. 5 / 5 Stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fast paced. Good variety of obstacles which makes for lots fun!!!<br />Would like a bit more items to win or purchase.

B005LAII8A|5.0|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />Despite seeing the previews, reading several reviews, and basically knowing beforehand what LOOPER's all about, I have to say that it still took me by surprise in many ways. Really fine acting, script, and cinematography bring about an immediate realism, which is especially important in a film set in the future with numerous science fictional/fantastic elements. I'm distractable and often downright dense but still followed the important points of what's going on here. LOOPER is definitely NOT one of those films that just tries to befuddle us with supposedly brilliant BS. It's one that you can watch again and again, always picking up something new in the way of hints, nuances, and details of plot.<br /><br />There are a few plotholes, which is almost inevitable in a film about time paradoxes, i.e., if time travel ever becomes a reality, will it be possible to go back and change what's already occurred? A few other little imperfections here and there, but it's a film that's good enough to where something is gained even from the blemishes. This is true of anything, I suppose, but if you watch LOOPER expecting it to be good, the various anachronisms and illogicalities shouldn't be too glaring. On the other hand, if you watch it in a really critical frame of mind, on the look-out for defects, said defects may be all too evident.<br /><br />The near future (2044) setting is well-done: A lot of interesting technology, but nothing too \\"out there.\\" It's also interesting to see how Kansas City might look 30 years from now. LOOPER will obviously resonate with many science fiction aficionados, and even many who generally hate this genre will find themselves making an exception here.<br /><br />This is one of Bruce Willis's finest performances. Emily Blunt as Sara is outstanding both actress and character-wise. Last but far from least, Pierce Gagnon as 5-year-old Cid is simply hypnotic and virtually steals the show whenever he's in it.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Overall a very nice addition to your Metallica collection.  The production quality is on par and I would highly recommend this Blu-ray for an amazing home theater concert experience.
B003WE9WRI|5.0|Good read for those who like to be prepared. If you have seen what happens to a pretend world after an Zombie Apocalypse (World Ware Z / The Walking Dead), you now know the value of being prepared. :)
0062082353|5.0|This book is an incredible look into the life of a warrior who dedicated his life to his country! Chris Kyle lives up to his nickname. A true american legend,
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Overall this is just a beautiful CD - a long time coming but worth the wait.  After listening to this CD my favorite song is &#34;One the Road to Love,&#34; the song co-written with Kenny Loggins and Loggins does background vocals - a very hopeful, upbeat song.  Other reviewers have pointed out that there are duplicates on this CD - &#34;Broken Dreams&#34; is a stripped down version from Justin's last CD, &#34;View from the Hill,&#34; and tracks 2 and 12 are basically the same.  Several songs are done in bluegrass style and what I think these songs show is the versatility of Justin's music.  I recently finished stage managing an Equity show, and the Tech Director of the theatre discussed the fact that he Loved playing Moody Blues music because it was scored correctly and made sense with chord progressions, etc.  That is definately shown here on this CD as I can appreciate the bluegrass songs even if they are not my favorites.  The jury is still out on the re-mixes of &#34;I Know You're Out There Somewhere.&#34;  Some of the background vocals sound muffled on the first remix.  I really like the Latin flavor to the second remix and would have only put one, not both, on this CD.  For die-hard Moody Blues and Justin Hayward fans, go ahead and get it, despite the duplications.
0425264386|5.0|This was my second experience with Lee Child and I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  I can understand why there are so many fans of the Reacher series!
B000FC10MU|5.0|I love this book! This is my eighth time reading it and I will probably read it again. Gaiman never ceases to amaze me. I recommend this book to everyone. While reading this book you will come across a bunch of gods you have probably never heard of... because of that I recommend this site:[...]<br />It does a pretty good job explaining the gods and where they come from. Enjoy the book!<br />SPOILER:<br />I would love to see another story of Shadow returning to Jacquel and Ibis's funeral home! They were two of my favorite gods in the story!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|ARGO (2012)<br />Excellent!  I learned a lot.  I'm fascinated by the way the escape was orchestrated.  What a revealing look at history!  We need more movies of this quality.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This was such an adorable movie, my husband and I even loved it.  It was very well done, and so adorable.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|While in the middle of a Bible study, when I do a search, the Ap will close without notice.  It does this all the time, it isn't a one time thing.  I think it would be nice if one could highlight a passage permanently.  You can however add a bookmark, that is expected.  I wish the program was more stable.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|this app makes my kindle laggy. its slow when its starting. sometimes, I can't play with it. overall, I am somewhat impressed about this product. I like it when I'm playing it but those lags make me irritable.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|This program does not work the way it is described to work, I have tried to load my location several times, but it doesn't seem to be able to move from the pre-destination it came with.  It does NOT show me the constellations when I hold it up to the sky.  It isn't worth your time or money.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|good game a lot of fun good graphics recommend to other players like battling other players easy to use only. draw back takes up a lot of memory
B00365EVWE|1.0|i just got my earphone and actually it is the first time i actually write review on amazon.<br />  senheiser is a well known earphone brand and i can not believe it produces such poor mid and high, even for the bass, it is even worse than cx 200.  and for senheiser the higher the series the better the sound quality it produces, also when u volume up it just<br /><br />mid and high distortion and the low power of bass<br /><br />chord sound---- i have used it for 2 days and its right side has extreme chord sound, i am going to return it right now!<br /><br />for 185$ price label? clearly it is knock off. for 31$ buy in?  please forgive to say it- it is a knock off for 31$ earphone.<br /><br />forgive me to say it again : i have bought knock off bose ie-2 product before, and i am pretty positive that the unit from senheiser sounds similar with the unit from my fake bose ie-2 !<br /><br />if amazon or whatever refuse to return my product, i am going sue them for selling knock off on internet.
1400052181|5.0|This book is incredible, I can't put it down.<br />The book is not only about Henrietta, her cells, and<br />medical research, but about her family's tragic story as well.
B002QP145C|5.0|I have watched the U.S. version several times and always enjoyed it. This, uncut version make this movie even better. You will have to see it to undrstand what I mean.
1939416019|3.0|Predictable, unrealistic. Everything is convenient and rather uncomplicated for the main character. Characters are stereotypical. Rice tells instead of shows, with very little tact or elegance.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|we love downton abbey. can't wait for season 4 to start. best series we ever seen. so much in each episode
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|The service was excellent. My package was in ship shop shape and the service was fast.  I am very pleases.
1585427683|5.0|This book has been a life changing experience for me.  My whole way of thinking has changed since reading it.  It is a must read for those who want to get in tough with the power of your mind.
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|If you have been following the cast of Glee, this is a great way to move along. Graduation ois a great place to be, and they captured those songs.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Perfect combination of beautiful graphics, relaxing  sounds and easy to use  format.  I love it!  I use it to wind down and clear my mind.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was difficult to put down. A lot of surprises. Decided I didn't like either one of them but mostly her. My book group gave it high marks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has great levels of jumps! Better then temple run! You fly, can spring up, multiply (no where close to math) and skateboard!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a great game and all, but it just makes it so you want and need to spend 99 cents here, a dollar there.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It's great! The cover's are in great condition as well as the discs. I've really enjoyed watching it. Thanks so much for everything.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|It was almost exactly like Percy Jackson except that there were Roman forms too. And it didn't tell like the character was actually talking to you like Percy Jackson
B000SEI618|4.0|After 50 years, Max, recently widowed, returns to the English seaside resort where his family vacationed when he was growing up.  Although he'd been a \\"townie,\\" his parents staying in no more than a shack, he'd carefully explored his environs and become an intimate of the well-to-do family who rented a sprawling summer home called \\"Cedars\\" every August.  In this setting, events jell into a nightmare by the sea.  Or perhaps the family dynamics brought out what was already inside Max.<br /><br />Those who enjoy John Manville know that his prose is lovely-- poetic and philosophical.  For this reader, however,  the ongoing depictions of every possible nuance concerning the seaside setting is overdone and slows the narrative.  That said, the plot of \\"The Sea\\" is spellbinding and the characters unforgettable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for anyone!!! I think it is so cool and addicting! I would recommend this game to anyone.
B000W9399S|2.0|The \\"Color of Magic\\" by Terry Pritchett is the first book of 54 in an incredibly popular Discworld series in the fantasy genre. The narrator tells us that there is no map of this world of color and magic, but I needed a map.  I found the story confusing and rambling.  Maybe that's the point, let go and be lost.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Flynn does an excellent job of changing the narrative each chapter to keep you reading. A classic mystery thriller romance
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I love this series and can't wait for the next season but since I live in the US I will not have this pleasure until next year sometime.  Can't imagine how Mary will handle the loss.
B005PYZG6E|4.0|I combined this with \\"CowboyStudio Shoulder Support Pad for Video Camcorder Camera\\" and \\"Focus rail slider\\". The shoulder support makes this product viable as a steady cam rig.<br /><br />The shoulder support gets the weight off your arms and onto your body which will always be the most stable part.<br /><br />The focus rail slider mounted between the stabilizer and the camera, speeds up balancing out the rig. When the 3 products are combined you have a versatile steadicam rig for under a $100.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I'm satisfied overall with this purchase. Loved the first Jurassic Park and the other 2 are decent flicks. Though aside from my satisfaction with the product, I feel I do need to say that though I don't blame my seller, I received my Blue Ray package in extremely beaten up shape. I blame delivery but it was a shame receiving something I wanted to have in pristine condition so totally beat up. Though disks and all internals were perfectly fine.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Both main characters are whack jobs!  They are despicable people and  deserve each other!<br />Jumping from person to person and times are confusing.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun and interesting hidden object game. Loved being able to play the first chapter for free. Game was long enough to make purchasing worth it. Would have been nice to explore more, but will play again.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is an awesome app. also basically what I was looking for.I have used this app to relax day and night.  Hopefully they give more sounds ..I have even recommended it to friends. They also love this app. Now ...that being said.. sweet dreams!
B008HTQ28K|3.0|I did not find this book at all enthralling just wanted to get over reading the book because I paid for it and did not want to waste my money.  The story was alright but it was not for me a page turner.
B0081U0HKY|5.0|I though it is a very interesting story about the value of a life, with eternal question of youth. Between a duration allow by man kind power and what god plan for humains.
0316172324|1.0|Sold as 'Brand new', however was in a very old second hand condition, marks all over the over, will return

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The update doesn't work on the kindle fire like when can I get the update  and I want it now make the update come to the kindle fire HD plz I really want it
0345803507|5.0|Better than the first book.  Not quite as graphic as the first book but a very good story line.  Will read it again.
B008VBYN80|3.0|It's an okay game.. Very similar in play and the mechanics as many other free games.seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one
B00B2V66VS|4.0|everyone in the family is playing this! I wish the twists and turns wouldn't repeat themselves so often. I like it when there is variety to the run! I know my husband and I have swiped to the left or right and had the runner jump off the screen or slide. At first we thought it was our error, but after many times playing it I do believe it is a slight glitch...
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Muy bueno y muy entretenido recomendado,lo juego cuando tengo ratos libres y aveces me dan ganas de tener m&aacute;s ratos libres
B000MV9026|4.0|I have two boys under 6 and they love this move... the cute penguins, the music, the story, truly kept their attention. It's been a replay movie in our home for months now.
