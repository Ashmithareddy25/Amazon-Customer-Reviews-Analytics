B009ZZDNT6|5.0|very loud! best download available! I defenitely reccomend it! there are several tones available! some are loud and some are soft!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I've bee reading the books and the series is just as good. I can hardly wait for the second set of Dvd's to hot the market.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and kills time (maybe not so great for a college kid) and it is so like the game at the arcade but you get more coins every 30 sec's!!!
B0034G4P4O|3.0|I'm a Tintin fan since 1967 when I bought my first Tintin book. Having read the reviews of the movie I knew what to expect, and I got it. Professional production, excellent animation, but not so much humour or charm.
B00683JK9K|2.0|Pictures were nice. Okay for one time play since pictures don't change once is enough. Regular puzzles are so much better.  Would not waste time or memory downloading similar ones.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always loved Mahjong. This app has so many variations &amp; levels that it's hard to get bored. Sometimes I have to force myself to stop playing because my eyes hurt!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Excellent reading. Almost as good as the first volume. Could not stop reading. Follows the recipe of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". Engaging Novel,Rich in details and historic events. Looking forward for the release of the third volume.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|Nice on-disk art, nice packaging, OK music - but not nearly as exciting as hearing it during the movie.  There are only a few tracks I really like, but I prefer the full-bit master CD (or Blu-Ray movie sound!) over the &#34;buy-a-track&#34; compressed MP3s.  Daft Punk did a great job creating the mood for the movie, so kudos!  This CD was my final add-on to the &#34;ultimate Tron DVD set&#34; that came in the light-up Tron disc pack - but had no soundtrack.  Some reviewers have noted this album is missing several tracks, so minus two stars for missing tracks and somewhat repetitive sounds.  It's still enjoyable, and recommended, if you like Tron and Daft Punk.  At $10 it is a good deal.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|When I first got this game I thought, &quot;oh just some free game that's going to be stupid like the rest of these free games.&quot;  but it isn't.  I think its a lot of fun.  they have the actual voice actors on there as well as good graphics.  I recommend this for any briny out there.
0547884591|5.0|This is probably the most entertaining cook book ever written.  The term \\"cook book\\" used loosely, as it is as much about the process of learning as food.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I love all of Chris's Albums. I've been here for him since he released \\"Run It!\\" In 2005. Chris has never been \\"Super R&B\\" And he's always been into the trendy scene, setting the trends and such. He's just an expressive person..AND HE'S 23!! If you go to any young person around his age they are all more than likely into what he's into, but no one get's to express it like he does..<br /><br />NONETHELESS..This album is NICE. I love it. Free Run is probably the best song which showcases his vocals. But even as much Processing is done on his vocals through out the more pop sounding tracks i still think he sounds Stellar. Superb. And his rapping get's me hype. What more can i ask for??  Always here for Chris, \\"X\\" is gonna be a classic!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game. I think that this is one of the best apps out there now. I love it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think you should all buy this app and play this app, because it is an awesome app I LOVE THIS APP. You should to.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is lots of fun with lots to do new places to see and visit I wish u didn't need energy to do things tho that kind of gets in the way but I guess if it wasn't that way I would play all day and never get anything done lol. great job guys keep the good games coming!!
B009PEPML4|5.0|GYBE has never written a song that I could listen all the way though without holding my ears or getting bored. This album is no different, but that's ok. Really, this is more of an emotional experience through sound than music.<br /><br />Other post rock bands seem to be trying to create a specific sound or emotion, and end up with something synthetic and insincere. Godspeed once again transcends the genre by channeling their actual emotion and crafting songs that are true to themselves. This is not the best Godspeed album; much of the music is grating, and the main themes of the two songs are not mind blowing. But really it is the restraint and sincerity of the album that is its greatness, and I have a lot of respect for Godspeed for not changing themselves. Equally as important, this album is a distinctive entity and is not derivative of the band's earlier music.<br /><br />I thought the two drones on this were going to boring, but \\"Strung like Lights\\" is one of my favorite parts on the album. The staticy cacophony subsiding into the electronic tone is simple genius. This album comes with a free bonus feature: both drones, when played in the background, will transform any video into a sinister plot for world domination.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple idea, but the boards can be pretty tricky! Great brain game that I enjoy as much as my kids.
0810989956|5.0|This book was at amazing price for a hard covered book, its was a christmas gift and she really likes it. It came in great condition.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|this is a classic movie that I remember from the 80's. I absolutely love it. Patrick Swayze is dreamy. It's one of my favorite romantic movies. &#34;Nobody puts Baby in the corner.&#34;
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Great movie for the whole family! However, now my kids wander around speaking in terrible, Irish, cockney accents. Buyer Beware!
B002KLAL4W|4.0|cant go wrong with pearl jam ever as they are good hearted awesome live band for some time fo sho
B00006IX0R|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift. I am sure it will be enjoyed and appreciated.<br />Thank you very much.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|No show in the history of television stands in comparison to the supsense and depicting the power of family and ambitious drive to obtain the AMERICAN DREAM.  This show is recommended for anybody who loves not being able to watch one show at time, if you try watching Breaking Bad, you will be saying the following, &#34;I (we) can just watch one more show tonight.&#34;<br /><br />Good luck with Season three, The cover explains it all.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I used to love this app- it was so easy to use and worked great.....then i downloaded the updates and the only thing it does reliably now is force close. please fix this!!! I miss the app that actually worked!
0547884591|5.0|Tim! Thanks! I loved the book! Content great as expected, the Ferris way.. and very impressed with the great design! Great chances I will use this book even more than 4HB<br />Thanks again!

B004Y8075M|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is a concrete member of nearly all adolescent, young adult best novel lists.  Lois Lowry's The Giver was published in the early 1990s. Shortly after, the novel found itself in the classrooms of English teachers.  This relatively modern novel has been widely praised by students who have been assigned to focus their attention for the span of the assignment.  It is my belief this should be the case and it should also be widely used by Social Studies teachers.  As someone with a B.A. in History and an Integrated Social Studies license, this is a very effective way to teach students the characteristics of utopian societies.  It can also be used as a method to study factory or company towns, such as the Pullman Town of late 19th century Illinois, which is a subject of study in United States History classes.  If students have read The Giver before studying Pullman case and the strike that occurred as a result of the town's traits and how it applies to business of the era, lessons would almost certainly be more effective.  Students of the class may find the objectives easier to understand.  There are many novels where English and Social Studies teachers of all age levels (though it may be most effective at the middle and high school level) should combine forces to teach content.  The Giver is a prime example of a great, compelling novel that should be used in English and Social Studies classrooms.  Students may also enjoy that it is a quick and easy read.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|There are always layers of stories to work through with any of her books, and this one is no exception. Totally keeps you guessing until the end. Great read!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|He is my idea of a modern day cowboy like John wayne . Lee<br />Child writes fast paced with  a good story line
B0050IY61G|5.0|RealSports on HBO is usually the only thing that makes me cry but tears flowed as I realized that other than my son, I have never met another person with Aspergers. I went from being 90% sure to 100% that we both suffer. This book is a must and I ordered the paperback and Kindle editions. I promised myself that I wouldn't become obsessed, major fail. If you suffer from Aspergers this book is for you, if you know someone with Aspergers get this book. You are not crazy just different.
B000002GW5|5.0|I used to listen to this CD when I was little and wanted to bring that feeling back. It worked!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Great app for toddler. Very easy for him to move the pieces. Love the extra bubble popping feature. Would pay if needed.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I was not a fan of the first Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes film.  I actually saw it in theaters and walked out of it.  Later on I decided that was too harsh and purchased the first movie on bluray.  I still regret it to this day.  Not sure why I opted to rent Game of Shadows, but this one turned out to be MUCH BETTER than the first one.  The rapport and chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law is fantastic.  I love the many quips and &#34;slopes&#34; in this film.  The actor who plays Moriarty was cool too.  But the scene that got me the most was the two minute slow motion sequence toward the films end.  That scene alone won me over and I knew this movie had to be a part of my collection.  I LOVE this film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't believe how so totally hooked on Walking Dead I have become. Normally I wouldn't watch this kind of show but it pulled me in from the start
B009VB97EY|2.0|This movie did absolutely nothing for me.  I didn't expect it to be Oscar worthy but JESUS.  I was bored out of my mind within the first 20 minutes of the movie.  It's great there is a movie for ladies and gents who want to oogle over Channing Tatum's thrusting pelvis and six pack abs but this move is just plain DUMB.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I love this book. I have read it 10 times and use the info all the time! I would suggest reading it before opening your business.
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|I really do not understand the big deal about this film.  Yes, it was a big blockbuster with a &#34;great&#34; cast but this thing bored the heck out of me in theaters and on Amazon Instant video.  Too much ego tripping going on in this film.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great plot. Characters came to life through the words of the author. Too much death for my liking. Several main character killed off.
B009FXIICK|5.0|I don't play many games on my phone or tablet, but i downloaded this since it was the app of the day. I usually keep myself up at night trying to beat my last high score.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Sooo funny!! I watched this with my boyfriend and it was hilarious, it's not just a kids movie at all. Watching it on amazon instant video was also super easy, I bought it online, then watched it on my Roku.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story! The author must have had a vivid imagination to really write this book! I love how it takes place in the future!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Wish he would write two a year!  He is one of my favorite authors, and the books last only a day or two because I cannot put them down.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Just received the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital copy of Prometheus from Amazon. Tried to play it on my Pioneer BDP-320 and cannot get beyond a black screen. Looks like Track 88. Downloaded and installed version 3.73 firmware upgrade (dated March 2012). No luck. Tried to play it on my ASUS EeeTop and of course it says it need an upgrade but when you are directed to Arcsoft it says I am using the latest version (dated 2009). When I upgraded to Total Media Theater 5 lo and behold it worked. But this would cost me $99 for an unlocked version. Right now I am using it for 15 days free trial. So I tried to download a digital copy and iTunes say that my redemption code is not valid. So I guess I can only watch the DVD copy.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|This book chronicles the journey of ultramarathon legend and vegan Scott Jurek. As an endurance enthusiast and vegan myself I really wanted to like the book. And I did in a way. It gives you some good details about the early life and racing career of Jurek in his own words, as well as a bunch of recipes from his repertoire.<br /><br />The book seems to lack some soul though. You don't get a sense of great feeling, whether it's enthusiasm, depression, joy, whatever from Jurek (or his ghost writer?). Maybe in life he is like this as well, I don't know. There is certainly enough in there to keep you reading but the book just never clicked for me.<br /><br />It's worth the read IMO, just not as good as I thought it would be.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Bounces back and forth between past and present making the story intriging as you obtain bits and pieces that provide more and more clues of what secrets have been kept over decades.  Suspenseful, happy, sad, can't-put-it-down book with twists and turns throughout, and a surprise ending.  Loved it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|packaged excellently and its what i was looking for and it arrived early!! very pleased with the purchase and i am sure my son will love it
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is highly addictive. love it! it does get more difficult as you achieve more levels. works perfectly fine on my kindle fire.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|President Barak Obama wrote this book when he was 33 years old, long before be dreamt of becoming the President of the United States. This book is well written and very interesting, revealing the struggle of a bi-racial young man in U.S. society. I found it very touching, and it made me appreciate our president all the more.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I read this right after reading 1984 and was sick to my stomach at how disturbingly similar the fictitious dystopian world created by Orwell is to real-life North Korea, which is described in nauseating detail by Harden.<br /><br />This is such a visceral account of a boy's unbelievable journey. You see his torture while in the camp and his painful assimilation to life outside North Korea, and at the end you can't quite tell which one is worse. I was sucked in from page 1.<br /><br />This should really be required reading for anyone in a &#34;first world&#34; country for two reasons: First, that you might thank your lucky stars you don't live in a society ruled by sick tyrants; second, that we might use our knowledge and resources to put a stop to these atrocities against human rights.
B00486070K|3.0|I needed one of these as I use a macbook air (mountain lion) as my primary work laptop and connect to both wireless and wired networks.<br /><br />This review give the product 3 stars. If it was for my first adaptor it would be 1-2 stars. That one had the plastic sheath on the USB portion of the connector break and pull away in the first week of use.<br /><br />After the return/new cable I'd say it's 4 stars. Works flawlessly.<br /><br />I should note that both adaptors are extremely plug and play. Just plug them into any USB port on your mac and it'll be detected and set for DHCP automatically. No software installation needed. I've also used them with a static assignment and no issue there either.<br /><br />Hopefully if you do experience build quality issues like I did it happens early on and you can do a return.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the books by Viince Flynn, and this was one of my favorites, it grab me on the first page and kept me until the last page.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I'm a JFK nerd born in the wrong decade. I hadn't read a SK book in at least a decade. Very glad I read this one. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Main character is fairly bland in an every-man kind of way, which made him that much more relatable and appealing. I don't typically like time travel stories, but this one was quite believable. Maybe I'm biased to the time period and event, but I found the historical reality to be a fascinating place to make-believe.
B005FISBTO|4.0|I am soooo conflicted. I was so mad at Dexter (the character, that is) at the end of Season 4. Then in Season 5, they resolved nothing!!! Then I found out they had renewed it to Season 8! I was like, what the heck. How long can this possibly go on? Dexter has got to get caught sometime. Well, this season kind of redeemed itself.<br /><br />My problem is still that Dexter does not seem to be following his \\"code\\" anymore. He is not going after killers who fell through the cracks. He is purposely messing up police investigations and crime scenes just so he can get to the killer first! The big issue is... what happens when the killer just disappears? I guess the cops just forget they'd been working on the case for months and move onto the next one, right? And no closure for any victims. That's how it all happened before.<br /><br />Well, despite that, something about this show was fascinating enough that I watched all 12 episodes in 2 days, even though Dexter's technique made me furious. Even though I hate unnecessary sex and language (and this show really overdoes it), I am addicted to this show. (Showtime: just because you CAN do it doesn't mean you HAVE to.) The thing I liked best about this season was that Dexter finally seemed to be finding a new path in life. Not that it went that well. I'm not religious myself, but it sure was an interesting direction for the show and the character!<br /><br />Like I said, I am so conflicted. Sometimes I love this show, and sometimes it just infuriates me. I've been borrowing it from the library and I keep changing my mind about whether I want my own copies. (Maybe this will be the one set I can buy the complete collection of all at once.) One thing is for sure: after the way this season ended, we at least know Season 7 will have a purpose.<br /><br />P.S. After reading some other reviews, I sure am glad I am in the habit of sticking the DVD in my player while I leave the room to get my dinner. I cannot believe they put a spoiler to the ending in their shameful Showtime promotion! (I was already irritated with their un-fast-forward-able previews from previous seasons, so luckily I didn't accidentally see it on any of the discs.) And the ending was a surprise. And it sure was better than the AWFUL cliffhanger of Season 5.to the ending in their shameful Showtime promotion! (I was already irritated with their un-fast-forward-able previews from previous seasons, so luckily I didn't accidentally see it on any of the discs.) And the ending was a surprise. And it sure was better than the AWFUL cliffhanger of Season 5.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Computer graphics are simply awesome. At first, I didn't believe it. I had to rub my eyes and make sure that what I was seeing what I though I was seeing. But there they were, the guy from Roger Rabbit, the guy from Deadwood, the guy from Shaun of the Dead and the guy from West Coast Choppers. And they were all dwarves! It was awesome! So genuine, so real. So short. Ah, the story's not bad. A little long. Operatic delivery. You feel sort of sorry for the EQ, (evil queen). She's had it rough, taken as a child, cetera cetera. Female empowerment deluxe supremo. Can Liam Hemsworth actually act? I don't think so. But he does an okay Scottishy accent. Boy those horses looked angry during the battle scenes. I mean, they really looked angry, like they wanted to stomp on something. With their front hooves. The sound was great. Some of the scenes were fantastic. In the middle of it, I wondered if the tale was an allegory about Viking usurpers and the restoration of apple cheeked English maidens to RT's(rightful thrones). But character. Real, genuine character, evinced by the telling detail, or by authentic insight, not out of Dramatica Pro? mm
B006M4RN3U|5.0|It seems like the use of auto-tune has struck some controversy in some reviews of this album. I find it's use more than a bit annoying, but thankfully, it's not used so much on here that it becomes a distraction. In fact, in some tunes it really enhances the vibe. I held off getting this album for many months, fearing it would be too trendy or have too many hip-hop elements in the music. Have no fear; this is a mighty fine album, an easy Top 10 pick for me this year. The bottom line: these are great songs. I don't know enough about the members of this band to know who does what, but there is a clear songwriting talent at work; carefully crafted pop tunes that stick in your head. Vocally, the lead singer reminds me slightly of Freddie Mercury of Queen. That band was never one of my favorites, but I really like the sound of this group. Modern pop for modern people. I'm eager to hear more from Fun.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I'm not a fast reader, but I devoured The Last Man in just a few days!!!

B009YU62H2|5.0|Well after 16 years out of the scene -Soundgarden returns with a brand new full length. I must say, in the 90's I was not a HUGE fan, liked stuff off of \\"Superunknown\\" and so forth.  Wasn't until I got the \\"Telephantasm\\" compilation that my interest in the band was renewed and realized how much I missed out.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't compare this to their earlier works (the first three albums -before \\"Superunknown\\") -so I cannot expertly go there. I can say that I really like this, their new work \\"King Animal\\".<br /><br />I don't hear strain, I hear ease. Meaning this isn't a \\"comeback\\" album that sounds contrived or put out (solely) for monetary gain. Maybe diehard fans may or may not like it, but I enjoy it greatly and listen to it regularly. I would recommend this to anyone who likes great alternative hard rock with excellent feel, good arrangements and songwriting and a high degree of musicality.
0141197307|5.0|Love this book!  The patterning, the creative layout of the text, the colors!  It was such a joy to read.

B005LAIGRS|4.0|If you are anything like me, you've been waiting for a while for Ryan Reynolds to lose the funny pretty boy license and get into a role that required him to get dirty. That required him to be pushed decidedly out of his comfort zone. He is slowing starting to move in the direction of those who have come before him in the vein of Jamie Foxx whom a few years ago you couldn't have taken seriously. The action, the lack of gratuitous sex and  the menace are all very real - the ending is a bit too predictable and Ryan Reynolds hops back to safe territory by essentially being offered his dream job come the end of the movie and you can't tell me that the CIA would just let you burn them. I give Ryan A+ for effort, Denzel is of course always a pleasure to watch and this is a good show all around with less of typical action feel and more of a thriller one.
B000J233SK|5.0|one of her better albums. Dante's prayer, Marco Polo, etc...very beautiful I do have all of her songs. Night ride across the caucasus is a lesser favorite but everyone has different tastes. My wife has Alzheimers, so we both need exquisitely beautiful and soothing music to listen to over and over and over again and I am still not tired of it. I have lots of Enya and also like her work but they are different - here there are exotic instruments, Loreena's beautiful vocal range and mild Irish lilt, music that ranges from traditional, to classic poetry set to wonderful music, some of her work has a middle eastern flair. She lost her fiance' in a tragic boating accident and you can hear that in Dante's prayer - moving and beautiful. It is niche audience but Loreena states different musical styles work on your soul like different medications. If you like world music give it a try.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Just what I asked for.<br /><br />Only don't try to download their digital copy while in Kuwait. It will not work.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched season 1-3 in 2 days. I got that hooked. I can't wait for more! My husband is who got me hooked, and now this is by far my favorite show!
B001KMB6X2|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I use this movie with my wife when we watch other movies as the standard for worst movie ever. I ask her after we watch a movie that we did not enjoy was it as bad as Babylon A.D.. And thus far the answer has been no

I do not practice the Toltec religion myself, but can greatly appreciate the knowledge provided by the author. It's one of those books you can read over and over and gain something new each time. I will be buying more books by this author in the future.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This show is awesome.  i got rid of cable last year (one of the best ideas i've had) but i miss shows like this.  i had no idea breaking bad was this good.  a must watch if you're like me and don't have time to watch much.
0553801473|2.0|Whie I LOVED the first three books, by the time I got to this one it was so hard to read I almost didn't finish. He goes into detail after boring detail about non-relevant stuff . . . then all of a sudden mentions something critical thats easy to miss when you're skimming and you have to go back to find out \\"when did that happen!\\"
0307592731|5.0|Go listen to Diane Rehm's interview. It gives a good take on the book, and whether you want to read it. I believe you will. When you finish the book, you'll want to hike the Pacific Coast Trail yourself.
B009369Z8A|4.0|Well done.  Good acting, well written, excellent cinematography.  This is an excellect depiction of an era of American history and of an independent group of people who were fiercely devoted to their lifestyle.

B0086700CM|5.0|Thanks for getting the game on Kindle Fire. My 7 year old loves this game and wanted it so bad. Only bad thing is talking her into giving me my kindle back when I want it. lol  Nice getting more things available to the Kindle Fire. Thanks Amazon.
0545123275|3.0|So I purchased this book because of the positive reviews. I was really looking forward to it, and liked how it is in both Grace and Sam's perspective. I appreciated the world that Maggie Stiefvater was trying to create. But...here's what I didn't like.<br /><br />***Small spoiler alerts***<br />For one, it's painfully slow. I'm 83% through the book and borderline pulling my hair just trying to finish it. The worst of the worst is Sam. If it wasn't for the name on each chapter I would have a hard time knowing who is who (as in male or female). I'm all for effeminate guys, but considering Sam's life, the fact he spends a good portion of it as a wolf how likely is it a guy would say this:<br /><br />\\"My first impression of her was tall - probably because of the five-inch heels on the ass-kicking boots she wore - followed by ringlets - because her head had more of them than a porcelain doll.\\"<br /><br />Okay, I can almost go along with the ringlets comment, but not the boots. I have never met a man -- unless he's gay or works in some kind of fashion/design job -- who would A) comment on the inch of the boots, or B) use ass-kicking as a descriptive. And this is just one example. The boy uses OMG more times then I like and yea the list goes on. I found Sam lacking, I found Grace to be to ridged and hard to completely get into. There were time when I fell asleep because it just kept going on and on. And there was so much time spent in Graces house, I mean it makes sense because of Sam's condition but goodness 60 some odd chapters and basically the majority is just Sam and Grace sitting around -.- dare I say more!<br /><br />Honestly, it was a nice try, and I gave it 3 out of charity. I will finish the book out of principle but will I buy #2 and #3? No.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It has a great story line and I had fun watching this movie with my husband and nieces.  Most of my family love this movie.<br />I'd rate this movie a High PG or a low PG13.  It's a great family movie, but it is a little violent for kids under 5. and a couple times in the movie you see nude butts.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great to play but needs to have more cash awards in gold mine and should be able to get anything you need to finish a quest with out having to buy cash
0316228532|1.0|The characters were developed very slowly which gave you more time to dislike them.  This book was like watching grass grow.  Total waste of time and money.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Great movie, great actors, great story.  Excellent pacing in the movie and very inspiring.  What more can I say?  Watch it.
B0000009SY|5.0|Zappa is, well, not for everyone.  But, if you love it, you know what I mean.  He attracted some of the greats of modern drumming.  I bought it mainly for that, but I enjoy the music.  Vinnie sounds great, as usual.  Tunes take a while to grow on you.<br />Frank was a creative genius, and those don't come along every day.  Appreciate.
B007KCG7MQ|2.0|I thought I was buying a Joe Walsh album, what I got was a Jeff Lynne album.  The raw, reckless, unpredictable, ROCK albums of earlier Joe Walsh this is not.  I love Jeff Lynne from the ELO days, don't get me wrong.  But Joe let him add too many boring harmonies and drum machines to the mix.  In my opinion, very little Joe Walsh comes through on this album.  Too little for my taste anyway.
0385738773|5.0|It arrived before my scheduled due date. In great shape! It was a great book and finished it within 3 days.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The more I read of Martin's &#34;Song of Ice and Fire&#34; the more solidly I am hooked.  Great story lines, wonderful characters, the suspense keeps me reading way past bedtime, so I have to confess I am solidly addicted to these books.  I am constantly surprised by the amount of blood, gore and severed body parts, and yet I keep reading, and can't seem to put them down<br /><br />Please do not give these books to you children, they are definately for adults only.  I can only hope that Mr. Martin doesn't run out of ideas, paper and ink.  If you enjoy fantast at all,  you will love &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34;, I promise.
B008NEMPTO|1.0|I like action movies even if the plot for the movie is not really great.  I do not consider myself to be picky as long as there is plenty of action.  Lincoln was an exceptional individual and I did not read the actual book.  But the movie is so ridiculous with Lincoln hammering vampires with a big axe??? I was watching it in 3D on a big screen but at the end of the movie I felt like this movie is really-really dumb.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This movie is what Batman fans have been waiting for. THE Batman tale written by legendary comic writer Frank Miller is finally animated. Usually I find it to be ridiculous and a simple money grab to split a book into two movies. But it is a necessity for this one. The story is too complex for a 76 minute movie which is direct to DVD movie length. The animation is great and it really stays true to the source. I can't wait until I'm able to watch both parts back to back. These two will put the Nolan movies to shame. This tale was also the inspiration for Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises. (Just as Frank Millers other story and animated film, Batman Year One, inspired Batman Begins)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers Rocks! Keeps u entertained for hours. Great game for the whole family. Only downfall is I cannot update to the Xmas version!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I'm an avid Amazon.com user and this application makes shopping a lot easier. It's easy to keep an eye on orders and good at filtering your search results.
0385742886|5.0|Great book! Arrived before schedule due date. Sad to think this trilogy is over with. Now on to my next :)
B005LAIIS0|5.0|The DVDs arrived promptly & in excellent shape! ( I always expect one of the DVDs to be absent but they were all there!)
B007HACDLK|5.0|When you first start this book, you wonder if it's truly a Mitch Rapp/Vince Flynn grabber,  but after just just a couple of pages, you wonder no more and realize that Mr. Flynn has another first rate thriller on the list.
B00A7ZX37A|4.0|Never was a fan of her music, but her last 2 albums I enjoyed. Album is definitely a personal one.
B004ZNANZA|5.0|I have a recurring dream where I'm in a record store and I find long-lost outtakes from The Wall. This CD is exactly that. Some of the best tracks are the early version of Young Lust, with completely different lyrics (other than the chorus), and variations on the &#34;Another Brick In The Wall&#34; series. It's cool to hear tracks that wound up on The Final Cut and Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking. A must-have for any serious Floyd fan. My only regret is that I can't afford the Immersion box set, with another CD of demos and out-takes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As an avid fan I have yet to be disappointed with one single episode. If you are looking for a high speed shootout gorefest- rent a zombie movie because this show is not it. This show creatively and deeply illustrates the tactical strategic and moral dilemmas of survival in a hostile environment without rules.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|Back around 2005-ish, I heard a lovely piano version of her \\"I should be so lucky\\" she performed on Jools Holland show, and it sounded like it was taken from a disney fairy tale movie. The song's version here is very similar to the one she performed there. Goosebumps.<br /><br />This is how pop songs grow up. Take a hit song, strip it from its effects that were \\"in\\" the time it came out, and honor it with a proper orchestral arrangement. The combination of the orchestra, instruments and Kylie's naked voice, gives your ears a spa treatment, a warm hug to your soul, a smile on your face and an occasional tear in your eye.<br />What a way to celebrate the K25. Kylie Minogue knows who she is, knows her musical history and embraces her age and the time that has passed. She is giving us a fresh taste of old favorites with a very pleasant mature presentation.<br />In your hand - a timeless, brilliant pop album that stays forever and feels like you just had the best glass of wine in your life.<br /><br />Is it really 2012? or the good years of the 90's?<br /><br />Give the woman a crown. Kylie, please do more like this.<br />I recommend to anyone. New fans, old fans, random listeners.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My wife, my son, and I all love Angry Birds and enjoy playing it. The degrees of difficulty are just right and it's a blast to play
B0050R0XPA|5.0|I was very happy with this Lego set. I had very little problems. The Gazebo was a bit of a challenge, but turned out to be perfect and went together locking in. I love the post office. Admitingly, the vehicle is a bit larger in contrast to the rest of the parts, but it doesn't really matter. Looks good with the rest of my Lego Winter collection.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|The movie was just okay, not horrible, not great. I wouldn't<br />recommend it to any of my friends to watch. The quality of the<br />Amazon VOD was good, it was just the movie that wasn't that<br />great.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my kids love it and I'm so happy it was free! I even like playing it! poney fan since 1992!
B000AARKOO|3.0|I recently received this as a gift and I'm surprised at the high reviews here.  I've always wanted to see a good movie on the Crusades but this does not fit that category for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Awful storyline and in no way historical or believable.  The characters are flat and lifeless (Norton, Irons, Neelson, Greene, and Massoud try their best to hold up the falling script). Ridley Scott complained that the film was promoted as an adventure love story instead of a religious conflict and yet that is exactly how he directed the film.  If he wanted us to take it more seriously, he should have added more Crusades and less Hollywood B.S..<br /><br />2) Hard to follow and bad editing.  Much of the plotline is never actually filmed, leaving the viewer with a staccato of scenes as if the characters have severe dementia.<br /><br />Balian seems often to be a victim of constant happenstance as he wanders around the Levant in search of the wardrobe department.<br /><br />3) More like BRAVEHEART JOINS MIDDLE EARTH TO SAVE JERUSALEM BUT THEN CHANGES HIS MIND with all the rehashed subplots and equipment and reoccurring bit actors.  Makes me think that Ridley Scott was on auto-pilot as a renowned director.<br />Bloom actually won an award in Europe for his role as Balian, which to me is highly laughable (I'm picturing the part where Princess Sibylla relays how she was married young, as was very customary at the time--in fact, at fifteen she was an old maid--and Bloom's Balian gives us that astonished pirate look! Ha!  Whatever.).<br /><br />That's my take, but if it's mindless entertainment you want, with lots of swordplay and blood, here's your baby.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|Silverthorn continues Kamelot's legacy of great music.<br /><br />The album has an overall dark feel to it (as though the cover art didn't give that away), but the cd is a journey through a story with lush vocals, epic scores, and deep musical compositions.  The musicians all perform grandly, and the new singer on this album fits in nicely.  The sound is quite similar to some of the earlier albums, so fans of Roy Khan (the former singer) shouldn't be too disappointed.<br /><br />Definitely an album that requires multiple listens to fully appreciate, the music is complex but fantastic.  You will have some memorable and catchy melodies, but Kamlelot succeeds in the full complexity and layering of sound.  Not for everyone, but definitely a must for fans of progressive/power metal.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 3 year old and 7 year old love all the Dr.panda games! Not timed so no angry guest.  Keep up the good work! Thanks
B005FDXT32|3.0|Don't get me wrong this is a great movie...when I saw this on blue ray..I knew that I had to get it..but when I started to watch the movie and noticed in the opening scene. With Tony being asked question..I saw that the picture was not cleaned up..like in some parts of the movie...I still love the movie..I just wish that they should taken more time on making it better...
B0098VYCCE|4.0|the graphics were really phenomenal, the characters played their roles very well,I definitely liked the different spin on snow white, and the twists were appreciated, Id give it an a-, but they dont have that option, so its like 4.5 stars, lol
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm very happy that I bought this DVD.  Jillian Michaels gives you a great workout in a short time.  I really love it!!!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I could not get this to work on my Kindle Fire.  No explanation how to put new locations in.  Los Angeles weather is of no use to me.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|The Muppets is a fun trip of nostalgia for those of us who grew up with Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and the rest of the Muppet Show.<br /><br />The movie begins with Gary (Jason Segel) and his brother Walter (a muppet) who grow up as fans of the Muppets.  Of course, Gary grows into an adult and Walter stays his same \\"muppet\\" size.<br /><br />As Gary plans a 10th Anniversary trip wtih his lovely girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams), they decide on a trip to Hollywood and Muppet Studio.  Walter is invited along the trip.  After arriving, the trio find the studio in decay and about to be taken over by an evil real estate tycoon (played by the brilliant Chris Cooper) unless the Muppets raise $10 million dollars.<br /><br />Walter, Gary, and Mary set out to find the Muppets, reuniting them with several adventures and attempt to perform a reunion show to raise the cash.<br /><br />The movie is a lot of fun, with many jokes and gags and guest cameo appearances.  These are especially humorous to those who remember the old Muppet Show on TV.<br /><br />I'm not sure that younger viewers who have never seen the original program will get all the material and character interaction.  However, the movie is suitable for enjoyment by the whole family, and if you are a fan of the originals you will definitely like this film also.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|I have enjoyed this movie in DVD and when it came out in BluRay 3D I decided that I would give it a try on my Panasonic 3D TV. I was so disappointed. The 3D was barely noticeable. I had assumed that it would be impressive given the amount of generated landscapes. I was wrong. The BluRay version looks great. 3d, not so much.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Wow, you're exhausted after reading this book!  Couldn't put it down.  Although it's a fantasy, I think the physical strength of Ethan Burke was  exaggerated.  You have to remember that we're dealing with a human being after all, fantasy or reality.  I liked it, though.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I really liked how the movie/story plot was about the danger greed can have on the environment, especially trees. It relates to how our big cities have no trees anymore, or if they do they are only in big parks, and it truely is terrible. This movie reminds us to appreciate nature and learn to live in balance, not conquer it and take control, because eventually nature comes back, and nature always finds a way
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was drawn in from the beginning. I was unfamiliar with the story, never saw the movie. It was a haunting, engaging. I liked the characters. I read the 2 sequels immediately after.
0439023521|4.0|I love the way Suzanne develops her characters and plots, specially in the first half the book. She does a great job also in the rest, but since the idea of killing each other it's not pleasurable and interesting for me, I don't like the part that game starts. I have to read it for my English class :)
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Very creepy.  I was a big fan of last season and am just starting season 2.  This episode did a good job hooking me into the new season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story. Well cast. Maggie Smith is my absolute favorite! Great if you like that era. Nice to see the rich sympathic plights
B00005214X|5.0|The songs and the spiritual vision that holds much of the material together are what make this first effort by George Harrison so timeless.  Superior in song quality to John or Paul's first efforts.  George had, like Solomon in Ecclesiastes, every possible human wish that could ever come true; money, fame, women, material goods at his fingertips and all the trappings of what many still consider &#34;success&#34;.  Seemingly &#34;older and wiser before his time&#34; (he was 28 when the album was finished) George was seeking a deeper meaning to life than the material world was offering.  &#34;Isn't It A Pity&#34;, &#34;My Sweet Lord&#34;, &#34;Awaiting On You All&#34; speak of spiritual searching and man's ability to long for something larger than himself.  Forty two years after its release, the songs and the emotions it still moves in me are as strong as ever.  Magnificent.
B000286RZM|5.0|There's not a lot to say other than that this is one of the best albums I've ever listened to.  Its songwriting is a lot slower and more subdued than most of the Chili Peppers work or the other JF solo albums.  Melodic and complex throughout, the melodies are sustained by Josh Klinghoffer's unique, expressive style on the drum kit.  The lyrics are philosophical and introspective, and as always, the guitar playing is exquisite.  It takes a few listens to truly appreciate it, but this is a must-have for any John Frusciante fan.
B00A856U7O|5.0|HATERS HATE TALK ALL YOU WANT.BUT THE QUEEN IS BACK BETTER THAN EVER!!!! FIRST SHE IS #1 ALL AROUND THE WORLD!! HER CD HAS SOLD OUT IN TEXAS PURO LATINOS OVER HERE THAT KNOWS GOOD MUSIC AND THALIA WOW SHE HAS SUCH A STRONG,WONDERFULL,VOICE!!! LOVE THIS CD AND SHE CAN SIGN NOT LIKE OTHERS THAT THER CD IS $5 BUCKS LOL COMEON AND STILL PPL WONT BUY IT! SO SAD :( FOR<br />PAULINA FANS
B004BLDD9Y|3.0|[Important Note on June 11, 2015]<br />My review was originally written for the \\"Lightning EVER 6W LED bulb\\". But now the Amazon product page shows a different product called \\"ChiChinLighting® 9 Watt LED Bulb\\". I wish Amazon would stop using this bait-and-switch trick.<br /><br />==== original review follows ====<br /><br />One unusual feature of this [[ASIN:B004BLDD9Y Lighting EVER 6 Watt LED Bulb]] is that it has a white ceramic heat sink. In contrast, the body of a typical LED bulb is made of an aluminum heat sink. The ceramic heat sink may offer the psychological benefit of being safer, since ceramic is electrically non-conductive. But whether it is as effective as aluminum heat sink is questionable. Previously I have tested the [[ASIN:B004YZRNKW Lighting EVER 7 Watt LED Light Bulb]] with similar heat sink design, and it burned out after just two weeks. This 6W version, however, seems to be doing well after one full month of usage.<br /><br />The power consumption of this LED bulb, according to my [[ASIN:B00009MDBU Kill-A-Watt Electricity Usage Monitor]], is 6W as advertised. Note that some other LED bulbs, such as the [[ASIN:B006Y4NPN0 Filite A19 5W Led Light Bulb]], may consume more power than advertised. Its Power Factor is only 0.62, which is not so good. (Lower power factor means more power is wasted in the transmission of energy)<br /><br />In side-by-side comparison with three other LED bulbs, this Lighting Ever 6W LED bulb is smaller in size (see photos I unloaded to 'Customer Images' section). It appears to have the similar brightness as other bulbs in the 6-7 watt, 400-500 lumen range. Its color temperature is slightly more bluish compared to [[ASIN:B005UPUMAI LG LED Bulb]] and  [[ASIN:B002ZBJ25G LWS A19 LED Bulb]], even though they are all called \\"warm white\\".<br /><br />I must take issue with the manufacturer's claim that this 6W LED bulb is a \\"50W Incandescent Bulb Replacement\\", because the latter actually generates about 650 lumens of light output. A 400 lumen LED bulb can only be called a \\"40W equivalent\\" at best. The tricky part is that: the beam from this (and most other) LED bulb is concentrated in the forward direction. So when you look at the bulb from in front, it appears as bright as a 50W incandescent bulb. But when viewed from the side, it becomes much dimmer. That means this bulb works best in a recessed light fixture shinning down, but not good for upward-facing position in a chandelier or floor lamp.<br /><br />Overall, this inexpensive Lighting EVER 6W LED bulb performed reasonably well (so far). But I have to minus one star for its deceptive claim of \\"50W Equivalent\\".<br /><br />[Update on Jan 2, 2013]<br />I opened the dead Lighting EVER 7W LED bulb, and found a busted polymer capacitor due to overheating. I also discovered that the bulb has no power regulation at all. There are just 60 tiny LEDs driven directly from rectified AC input. A small increase in AC voltage could cause the LED current to increase rapidly and induce a thermal run-away. I will stay away from all Lighting EVER products - for EVER.\\"40W equivalent\\" at best.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was my first Blake Crouch book. I'll be reading more! I downloaded Pines on a whim based on the ratings and was really impressed. Well written, fast moving and compelling premise.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I must admit I am addicted to this TV series and liked it so much I had to buy the first seson to keep.
0201633612|5.0|a must read for every programmer / designer. Great examples and in-depth description. Offers enough insight to jump right on.
1451620829|1.0|Like so many others on here I can't believe what I was reading! Everything bad that happened to Peter Criss was someone else's fault. But, of course, anything good that happened was his doing & no one else. Please give me a break! He bitches & moans about everyone; Gene/Paul only wanted $. Yet all he talks about is how he needs to make $ after blowing his fortune on booze/drugs/women. He complains about not making enough $ on the reunion tour but he easily forgets that he still got 25% of the $ from KISS AFTER he left.....25% Peter! For doing nothing. All four of these clowns were just lucky to get to the top of the music world. All of the sexual bragging & such, gets old quick. Deb, his ex wife, took him to the cleaners (or so he says) but of course he did nothing to help that matter. Poor ole Peter, he had to rent a private limo or private jet to fly home in....life just isn't fair to Peter...........<br /><br />I used to be a KISS fan, but not anymore after reading this book & Ace's. i have made a vow that these 4 idiots will never again get a penny of my $. They got plenty of it when I was younger & snorted it all up.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|This is the best album by any member of the Byrds and one of the better albums of the 1970's.<br />A classic- now oddly,  I prefer the demo tracks over the finished versions.<br />Clark voice is perfect without a lot backing it.  I think the problem with the album was the final product- if they left it alone with demo like versions<br />this would've been a classic of its time. Leave it to the studios to screw it up.<br />But do yourself a favor and listen to this one- one of my favorites and I have  4,000+ albums and cds<br />Enjoy !
B000WCDI5K|5.0|A must have for any fan of The Killers!!! I just love this album, the song Sweet Talk means so much to me.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved this movie.  Me and my grandchildren watched this movie 4 times.  It has a good message for the children to take responsibility for their action and decisions, to appreciate the people that have been there for them and to not be selfish.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Loved this novel can not wait for walking disaster from Travis's point of view. I thought it was well written and the story flowed. I couldn't put it down. You can't help but love Travis.

B001KX50BK|5.0|I love this movie so much so I was very pleased to get it on blu-ray so I can watch it whenever I want. Great price, fast shipping, great seller.
B000FC12C8|4.0|Lays down the basic principles of investing and these principles will be valid for ever, irrespective of the conditions or environment. High level of clarity. At the same time this is not light reading and requires concentration. Explanations and clarifications by Jason Zweig are excellent.
B00866H7SS|5.0|loving this series so far, is a great read. Tells the story of Eva a fresh out of college and working in New York where she meets a stranger Gideon Cross. Tells the story of love, loss and surviving. Recommend this series couldn't put it down.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|We had downloaded this game on our cell phones, my daughter and I, but my grandson enjoys playing it on my Kindle Fire because it is bigger.  I enjoy playing but he can beat me everytime - he is 4 1/2.

1844256383|5.0|This book covers the gamut from buying your first horn all the way up to basic repairs and regulation.  It is absolutely beautiful to look at and a saxophone geeks dream come true because the pictures are bright, crisp, and colorful and there are a ton of them.  I've been playing professionally for many years but still found this book to be interesting and informative.  I find myself wanting to buy the Kindle version of this so I can have it available on my iPad at gigs in case I get into a bind.  Beginner or advanced, there's a ton of information for any level.  You should check out Steve's website for even more information and opinion.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I'm a Zooey Deschanel fan already but last year when I saw this cd was coming out I had to have it. It stayed in my Christmas rotation and I didn't want to stop listening to it after Christmas was over lol I couldn't wait to listen to it again this year. It's perfection and I love it!
B0000669JL|5.0|Best music collection for Bob Marley. If you wanna know anything about Reggae, this CD could be the starting point.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved this book - continues on right where bared to you left off. We find out more about Gideon and Eva's relationship, Gideon's past, Cary and Eva's parents. Can't wait for the next installment.

B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|I've seen better Disney movies. This one was only somewhat amusing.<br /><br />Probably the most interesting bit of the movie, at least to me, was the animation of her hair and such. It looked wet when they got wet, etc.<br /><br />Overall, the movie wasn't that amazing, but I'm not a young child, and I don't have children.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|This album is awesome beginning to end!!! Mark Foster is so talented to have put together such a unique sound. I can play this over & over & never get tired of it.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Best series I've ever watched. Love the characters and truly feel invested in what happens. Thanks mad man! Can't wait for season six on DVD!
B008BM9L72|4.0|OK so here goes - I first heard about this series from my bestie so I thought I would give it a go. Was a great read - some things did just get repetitive. But overall was a great read. Tells the story of college girl Ana helping out a friend and meeting Mr. Grey. Tells the story of love, heart arch, trusting, moving on from the past, of and bdsm. Is a good read.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Loved this movie from the beginning to the end. It's amazing that he believes in his wife & his family where he goes as far as risking his life to save those!

1401224792|3.0|I have read every issue of Fables, Cinderella, and Fairest and was very much looking forward for another Fables stand alone graphic novel. I like the story, but the art is unappealing.  Actually, I just plane hate the art.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|horrible.  I started to play and. then after a month whenever I went to the store It logged. me out of the game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't express how much I truly loved this series of books.  The concept may be fairly common [a post-apocalyptic world], but the handling of that concept is truly unique.  Howey, you have done a masterful job at telling a story that I just couldn't atop reading.  Many times, I will read a novel that's leaves room for subsequent stories and when I finish them, I am an impatient mess waiting on the next part of the saga.  The reason being that I just wasn't fully satisfied and need some more resolution ASAP.  With WOOL Omnibus however, I am completely satisfied after having finished it.  Don't get me wrong, I can't wait to read the SHIFT trilogy and any subsequent stories that take place in the WOOL universe [I'm actually super hyped for the upcoming Third SHIFT and the 'SHIFT Omnibus'].  But, at the same time, I am 100% FULLY satisfied with the conclusion of WOOL Omnibus.  This is one of the greatest novels I've read in a long time.<br /><br />If you are on the fence as to whether this book is for you, all I can say is that you NEED to read WOOL.  The characters have great depth, there is suspense, mystery, moral & ethical dilemmas, commentary on societal control, on how to maintain an extremely fragile social system, on law, on politics and on civilization in general.  Overall, WOOL really makes you consider your own position in numerous ways and in many different conditions.  These characters have to make some real tough decisions and Howdy writes them so well that you feel like you're right there in the action.<br /><br />Furthermore, Howey's work is an inspiration to all of us aspiring authors.  His independent publication lets us know that we can do it as well and maybe even be as successful as he has.<br /><br />And Howey, I almost felt a little Judas-like for doing so [because I'm a diehard John Scalzi fan], but I voted for WOOL in the Goodreads sci-fi/fantasy of 2012 awards.<br /><br />Keep it up and expect another glorious review of the SHIFT trilogy fromme as soon as you finish Third Shift and bundle the three.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|verey great annd keeps you hooked until you die it has many different games that for some people can be challenging but for others can be great!
B003FC3LQK|5.0|To see this classic pic in HD was like seeing everything for the first time all over again.  Worth it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This is the strangest story ever.  I don't know if the genre is mystery or mix up.  I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  There are lots of better books to read.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I chose this rating because my son has been wanting this series!  He will receive it on Christmas Day.  I'm sure he will be eccastic to have it!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Picked up the the book after seeing the amount of Media intrest in it. Not my typical reading but overall liked the book and would read the entire trilogy
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I ordered this because I saw the old movie and wanted to read it I love it I recommend it
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am only 100 pages in but so far I find this book to be a joy to read.  History of dynamic personalities mixed with the history of the tech revolution in the bay area is absolutely fascinating.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I thought I would have a hard time plowing through this long novel, but it was such an epic tale that I flew through it. I felt like I was engrossed in a Downton Abby novel, only the character development and range of the war story was much better. I know it was fiction, but I feel like I understand WWI better than I ever did in High School American History. Thank you, Ken Follett.
B00992CF6W|2.0|it was okaaayyyy but awfully expensive. not really worth it cause you cant really do anything... the zombies kill you so easily. I would suggest getting the real version, though I did build a pretty sweet castle ;)
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I chose this rating because my son has been wanting this series!  He will receive it on Christmas Day.  I'm sure he will be eccastic to have it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|pretty good if you are looking for just a regular simple calculater. really awesome since its free but if you're looking for more deep and complex ur probably gonna have to pay for 1. this is great for what it is
B007IL5D3S|4.0|Vince Flynn has once again written brilliant story, very current!<br /><br />Only problem I had, the seems to be a couple of unnecessary plots points.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|One of my favorite  movies of all time, I am so glad to have it in  my collection so we can all enjoy it!
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I have been a fan since their self titled album.  I've felt that there has been a slow downhill trend in overall quality since then.  That said, the first half of their twin album concept breathes new life into stone sour.  Musically and lyrically this is exactly what I have been waiting for.  I won't go into any song breakdowns or favorites, but will say the album flows perfectly. This is exactly the album I knew they could put out and I cant wait til part 2!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Great DVD and great addtion to my library. Was shipped when promised and deliverd with no problems. A must for any Eagles fan.
B007XHWROK|3.0|I bought this because a friend of mine said that this album was really worth having.  I've heard it and am not impressed.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|People always expect these movies to be exact but that's not the case for these either. this sequel really makes an excellent connection to where the first film ended, where as many were confused as to how it ended this one clears all that up. the actors were great though i will say roles have been drastically changed form the original game, but you have to remember this a movie not a game they will include love interest and what not that's in almost every movie. The plot was great for a sequel it made sense and it has A LOT of fan service which i adore. this movie belongs in my collection. in conclusion the movies are much better than the Resident Evil movies where as in those add characters that never existed in the games. Give this movie a chance, its better than you might think. References to many other games in the series, try and see if you can catch them if you are a fan of the games.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is so great. im always weird about knowing how long something is going to take to charge or how long I can use my kindle before it dies and this app tells me everything I need to know!
B004I1WIWU|3.0|I was excited to hear her voice on vinyl, however I was really disappointed that the Digital quality came thru killing the excitement.
B009EAO38C|5.0|The group has managed to make an album where every song is amazing and sounds fantastic, whether it is an original track, a medley or just a cover all of the songs are as good as the next one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I can keep playing it for ever because there is always a new goal set. There are new games that I unlock everyday.
0143038095|5.0|had to buy this for my daughters high school reading and it was a great price without having to deal with parking in town
B007THA4FI|2.0|Way too many characters to keep track of, had trouble following who was who, what they were doing and how it related to the story.  Finally gave up.  Surprised because couldn't put the HP series down.
B005ZHB84U|3.0|This soundtrack is not bad, have a couple of amazing tracks, I really like it.<br />If you liked the movies I think you'll enjoy it
B000002GKT|5.0|The second greatest live album of all time, solid rockin' from the first note to the last. Early Frampton before radio over played him. What a great group Humble Pie were. I got to see them live right after Frampton left funny thing was Frampton's Camel opened the show with J Geils and then Humble Pie. They rocked the house that night, this was one of those bands that there studio albums were very good but live they really shined, they were performers and perform they did. On this album you hear a solid show but I have to say Splinters and Doctor just smoke all I can say is thank God for recorded music. There was something very special about both of the Fillmores that is for sure. If you only have one Humble Pie this is the one to have.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|I was expecting a better movie. First time in years thay i stopped watching a movie 5 mins before the ending.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|great game. many hours of fun. if you were a fan of my little ponies from the 80s this will bring back great memories
B008NW67E0|5.0|We think these guys are great!  we bought the first CD and couldn't wait for them to release a second CD
B0083P1QUM|1.0|too many characters to much confusion, had no idea where the story was going gave up after the forth chapter.  Used to like her books and read them all for a while but this is second one that I have read that is like this and won't waste my money anymore.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've been reading Follett for years, totally fell in love with the &#34;Pillars&#34;  sagas but he has out done himself with the first two of the 20th Century Trilogy. I ordered this one the day it came out.<br />thank you Mr. Follett for your extraordinary research and wonderfully developed characters.

1451627289|5.0|Bought this book as a Christmas gift. I got to read it second and thought it was a great read. It's still being passed along to other family readers and everyone is enjoying it.
0316069434|3.0|I was always wild about Harry, but I think the time has come for him to pack it in. The plot had potential, but it was wasted. Way too much time spent on Harry's personal life: his awkward relationship with Hannah and her issues, who has become even less appropriate a partner for him, and time with his daughter, which was basically a space filler. This is the first Bosch I've actually skipped reading pages to get back to the plot.<br />The story revolves around a cold case that's haunted Harry for 20+ years, and now in his new position he has the opportunity to take another look and make things right.Terrific setup, but it runs out of steam and basically reads by the numbers.If you're a fan of Harry and want to follow his life journey, go for it, but it's like seeing an old friend who used to be a great guy turned curmudgeon. He feels tired, the story feels tired, and I almost empathized with his boss for wanting to get rid of him. The third star is for the memory of an old friend. It really deserves two.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great movie even though I think chris evens is a horrible captaion america but still love this movie really worth it
B00571F26Y|3.0|There is too much information that was irrelavant to me; ie: the history of wheat.  Who cares?  I simply wanted a guide to eating glurten free.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I never got it. I ordered kindle version and it never arrived to my device. Very disappointed. Can't get ahold of anyone. No returned emails.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I haven't given this yet  since this this is a Christmas gift and I am sure she will love it!
B0018QQQK8|3.0|I typically stay clear of Nicholas Sparks books and movies, but what can I say, Zac  Efon made me change my mind. I found the story lacking in any major action or characterization. Everything seemed predictable. Maybe it's just personal taste because I've never read or seen a Sparks book or movie. I would just avoid it for something else.
B000W93CHC|5.0|The description of characters and environment is perfect, the reader<br />is transported in time and place; the human behavior is the same.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Nightwish is amazing. For anyone not familiar with them get this album! I would say the band sounds similar to Evanescence but with heavier guitar riffs and more melodic/operatic singing.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I played on this app at the store on the demo kindle fire. can I just say.....I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT!!!! I recommend It to anyone who loves to draw, dreams of being a famous artist, has kiddos or simply has free time and feels like doodling. GET IT! :)
B006RUJST6|5.0|Love it! loved it! loved it! it touched on every aspect I look for in a book! humor, drama, not totally knowing how they get to the end..

B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|The casting for this movie couldnt have been better, and the action was top notch. This was one of the best movies Ive seen in a long time. DEFINITELY A MUST SEE!!

B005XI9456|5.0|Look! I'm not a Justin Beiber fan nor is anyone I know personally. However, I somehow suspect that my daughter may be a &#34;closet Beiberite&#34; because I caught her listening to several of his songs on her iPhone just the other day. Her rationale: He was doing a cool collaboration with Chris Brown. Yeah, right! lol Anyway I digress. &#34;Under the Mistletoe&#34; is a surprisingly good Christmas album. Is it destined to be an iconic Christmas classic like the Jackson 5 Christmas album? Probably not! But it does a good job of expressing the Christmas narrative in a most refreshing and contemporary way. I guess my liking an album by Justin Beiber makes me a closet Bieberite too. Well, at least one month out of the year.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Recommended for anyone who would like an enjoyable, easy read.  Definitely written for adults, probably femails.  My husband got a good laugh out of the excerpts I read him.
B000I9WW4A|5.0|Del Toro and Depp are a match made in Heaven in this flick. Its just as funny now as it was the first time I watched it. If you havent seen it, then what are you waiting for??
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is my favorite show to watch every week. I was never a zombie movie fan but I do like watching the group go through their struggles each week just to stay alive.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! It kept me guessing and then completely surprised me in the end!  I love John Grisham's stories!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely for adults, but a fun read for a change.  My husband got a chuckle out of some of the excerpts -- not a story to be taken seriously.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|I love SOA. It is a show I reserve an hour for every Tuesday night. Season four was definitely an upgrade over a subpar season 3, but I still prefer the first two seasons. Still worth watching though.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is my favorite show to watch every week. I was never a zombie movie fan but I do like watching the group go through their struggles each week just to stay alive. My favorite person to watch is Daryl.

6305428050|5.0|I would recommend to all the people who like a comedy. The whole movie was great and it kept your attention. You did not want to leave watching it to even go the the ???. Make sure you put it on hold before leaving. The story line was great. I would say, if as a babysitter, you went into the city with young children, nine times out of a hundred this would happen. Buy the movie and enjoy.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED has some great speakers that present very interesting ideas. This app takes you straight to the videos :) Good to have.
B004J64QR4|5.0|Breathtaking, Fantastic, Superb!!!  The ensemble cast was so good.  I was moved to tears throughout.  What an amazing show.  A great purchase.

B008MZU8R0|5.0|I've been a fan since the 70's (yes I'm old). It amazes me how Rush continues to be relevent, in fact my son and his friends are fans.  Clockwork Angels is a must have.  I love the string section.<br />Favorite song: Caravan

1439153663|4.0|The main characters showed the contrast between the two races and classes. Kathleen led us into the different worlds of the free and the not free, the slaves.  She showed us what it was like on a typical plantation during those times in the south.  It was filled with information, compassion and history of those times.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|I really like this movie, it's a lot of fun!  If you own at least the first one, you need to buy this one as well!

B007OWRBJK|4.0|Growing up in northeastern PA, I only had top forty radio stations to hear music. The only Who song I'd heard before I went to college was &#34;Squeezebox.&#34; I was blown away when I heard songs from &#34;Who's Next&#34; on the claasic rock stations from Philly and Allentown. That was the stuff! I became a huge fan.  That year was their &#34;final&#34; show (I wore out the tape I'd made of that concert inToronto - the greatest concert ever - please release a remastered version of it all!).<br />I have remained a big fan of Pete all along and was excited to read this book. I cannot say it is a great memoir; what I wanted to read and what Pete wanted to write about certain events were not always similar. If I were editing him, there would have been far less talk of boats and houses and much more about the music.  I am sure there is someone who has counted how many different boats and houses were mentioned; meanwhile entire albums are brushed past in a sentence or two. Still, it is interesting: Mr. Townshend is surely one of the most creative men in history, though his ideas often exceed his ability to explain them. He does a good job of relating his horrible brush with the law over allegations of pedophilia, his often sad childhood, Woodstock, his relationships with his mates in and out of his bands, and his remarkable dedication to work and innovation. Every night I decided to read it I had a hard time putting it down. His caring really comes through; I feel a real attachment to him. His soul has been laid bare for us to learn from.
B000001ESJ|5.0|very good CD especially if you like hard rock that you have to listen to the lyrics a few times to understand the song ...and then the songs are open to varying interpretations. Very nice price for a remastered quality CD.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|downloaded this app thinking it was going to be a game with 100 diffrent games like fun games I could choose what to play
B004P7CNUY|4.0|This would have recieved a 5 star if it had subtitles.  I enjoy the movie, but i need subtitles.  If you dont need them, feel free to buy and be entertained.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|This is an attractive, well-made case that fits the Kindle Fire perfectly. Quality-wise there's nothing negative to say about it. The color is a nice brick red color and the inside is black. Be careful though, it does state on the package that it is compatible with the Kindle Keyboard. It is not. I have the Keyboard and it didn't even come close to fitting. Also, I'm pretty sure it will not fit the new fire HD. The price seems a bit steep but it would make a really nice gift!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been needing something like this! I love it! The only thing I wished you could lock your document on the free version.

B001GCUO4S|4.0|The movie is entertaining.  I like the series so i reallu liked this one.  Also, this is the first one to be filmed in the states, so it has even more props from me!

Compete against yourself as you keep your mind active!<br /><br />Would love to see some other games added:  multiplication, division, subtractions.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Waliking Dead is one of the best TV series going. If there is a negative side it's that they have drawn certain subjects out too long rather than getting to the meat of the matter then move on.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|It was different than the previews had made me think that it was about, which made it even better.<br />I recommend seeing this one.
B009D5VNLS|3.0|I must admit, I did not enjoy this as much as I have other animated movies (Tangled, Toy Story etc). I thought the story line was over the top and unbelievable. Of course, my teen & toddler both enjoyed it and they watch it often. After watching it again, it sort of grew on me. I initially expected it to be a story about a teenager and her struggle for independence. It wasn't so much about that as her bonding with her mother and the two of them coming to understand one another's point of view. Good nonetheless.

B009G78EE2|5.0|Fun, Poignent, Insightful, Solid beats, Great flow<br /><br />This is a great album that should have a broad appeal.<br /><br />This is a very mature effort
B00000293E|3.0|As badly as some of the reviewers have ripped the editorial review above, it actually captured what the weakness of this album actually is.  The performance is simply undistinguished.  As mentioned by others, Willie worked at Chess Records, writing great songs, producing sessions and playing bass.  In those sessions some great versions of these songs were recorded, most notably by Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, and Koko Taylor.  You can find lots of those on the [[ASIN:B000002P8I Chess Box]] compliation, which I recommend before this.  Yes, Willie was the blues, but these are not the best performances of his songs.  Sorry.
0060594896|5.0|If your looking for a book to help you step by step in going from where you are to where you want to be in any area of your life this is it!  Easy to understand with a lot of great real life stories to give you hope. I reccomend it!

B008V59AFW|5.0|This is a must-buy for all music lovers. Not only So was one of the most importants records of the 80´s, but this deluxe edition  improves on the original (the remastering is very good, I rememeber the original LP vinyl has some kind of sonic veil that made the sound muddy at times) adding a very good excellent live concert from the time period. This was also done with great success on Bowie`s Station to Station (1 remastered studio CD plus a 2-CD concert)<br />So has good music, strong lyrics and wonderful musicianship from the rhythm section (Tony Levis and Manu Katché)apart from showcasing Gabriel`s more mature songwriting and voice...I recommend this recording very much
B0012SCHZK|3.0|I purchased this to show clips to my senior English class.  That said, if you want to be entertained, this is certainly enthralling.  However, if you are viewing it for academic purposes, you will want to capitalize on the opportunity for a comparative analysis between this version  and the original epic poem.
0393334988|5.0|I came upon this book after reading at bbc.com of the recent death of Eric Lomax.  It is difficult to do justice to the power of this book.  The passion for trains that filled his early life forms a backdrop for war and captivity and peace throughout the life of Mr. Lomax.  But the real story is that of his time as a POW at the hands of the Japanese on the Burma Railway and how this shaped his life to the very end.  Lomax is at first rather better off than many of his fellow prisoners; a skilled technician, he is put to work in the locomotive shop and is treated with some humanity by his Japanese captors, who are for the most part engineers and not military men.  But when Lomax and his companions build a secret radio, his life changes for good and all.  The radio is discovered, and Lomax is tortured and interrogated with great brutality, imprisoned eventually in the infamous Outram Road Jail, which is sufficiently horrible that his transfer to Changi for medical reasons seems like a spa vacation in comparison.  The detachment with which Lomax describes his experiences is in itself chilling and unsettling.<br /><br />After the end of the way and the liberation of Changi, Lomax returns to England, deeply marked by his years as a POW.  The heart of his story unfolds when he discovers the identity of his interrogator, still alive after 50 years.  Their mutual story of forgiveness and redemption is powerful and impossible to forget.  Even if you have no interest in World War II, this book will get a grip on you.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|A must read for any halo fan a great work of literature and craft  Eric nylund should be commended on the masterpiece

142311339X|5.0|This is really a great book. I love every book by this author. The Lightning Thief series is another great buy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app, I love all of the bible options ( NIV King James ext ) I also love the fact that you can listen as well as read it.<br /> I would highly recommend it to every one
B007V65R54|5.0|Best book on statistical analysis I've read.  Easy to follow, written in everyday English.  Recommend to all who want to understand and evaluate the numbers others provide
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Full of suspense i can ‘t to read the next book characters are so real i will miss them one  suggestion can we bring rue back to life
B00A5052YE|3.0|I have every CD AK has made and I love every one of them. This CD is not bad but there is nothing special about it either. I like: Girl On Fire, That's When I Knew and one other song on the CD. I still enjoy listening to Alicia's voice, but this CD is boring and redundant. I wanted goose bumps, but it just wasn't happening for me. I am still a fan but I have to be honest, this CD is not her greatest work and you will be better off just buying the couple of songs as singles. Who knows if I can't get a refund perhaps it will grow on me......but not likely.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I was a fan of the original MLP and fell in love with the MLP FIM series. The game stays true to the show and has the voice cast from the show. Cute graphics and solid controls. I have no issues with some extra things requiring actual cash since the game is free and developers should be paid for a good product. I am having issues connecting to the Gameloft social network. I had to use gems to skip tasks that required using a social network to progress the story. I never send facebook friends game invites and I'm not fond of receiving facebook invites for games. Fix the gameloft live issues for kindle and this game will be fabulous.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read 50 Shades of Greay and this book is definitely better. Better written for sure.  What more can I say.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|P!NK sings every style of music on her latest release: rock, pop, rap, and she even has what sounds like a little country tune to me, titled &#34;Beam Me Up.&#34;  That songs makes me cry every time I hear it.  I think this album is her best release yet!
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Movie was great...coulda been greater if the sound was better. I had the volume at max but had to lean in to hear the dialog. Seems to happen frequently with amazon video. You folks need to fix this.
B00004W4UB|4.0|This alternative look at the Jeckyl/Hyde story is a well-crafted glimpse of late 19th century London. Atmospheric and creepy, it provides both fascination and chills galore.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|How do you review pinball, there is not much to mess up. There are paddles and a ball, and you try and keep the ball in play. This does all of that.
B001NB1J7I|5.0|. . . but while they sleep, I sing and dance.&#34;  I first bought this album as a real vinyl album all the way back in 1975, when I was 15 years old.  I bought it again on cassette tape when cassette players in the car became popular, then I bought it again on CD when CD players in the car became popular.  Now, of course, I had to get the digital version for my cloud player so now I can play it anywhere in the world as long as my smartphone has a connection.  I love every song on it, and I always have for the last 37 years!
B005FISBTO|1.0|As others have pointed out, this prodcut is ruined by a long, UNSKIPABLE ad for Showtime every time you play each disk.  Unexcusable.  I can't recommend supporting this kind of shady marketing.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and laughed at quite a few moments. I loved the plot, the message of beware of judging those you don't understand, and the moments that just make you laugh (no spoilers). You may look at the description of this movie and think it is just another I see dead people/zombie/paranormal animated movie but give it a chance you may find yourself enjoying it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. So happy I decided to read the book first because I am able to picture it all in my head. Very anxious to see the film and read the next two books
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I had not llistened to a lot of Santana's recent material until I did a report on him for class I am taking at the local community college.  I listened to a snippet of this album while doing research and became enthralled.  As Santana said himself, it's just a Mexican playing guitar, and play it he does.  Now it has become one of my favorites.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I was extremely impressed with the first of the Century Trilogy, and not disappointed with Winter of the World. I highly recommend it. Following the characters through the historical events is engrossing, and provides a great perspective that I think is valuable to everyone.<br /><br />I occasionally checked characters and events mentioned against historical sources, and always found that Follett's research is impeccable. That's one of the major reasons I appreciate this work and the previous one, in addition to being a great read, they're an educational opportunity that makes history more real.
0761169253|5.0|There are several chapters in this small book. The later chapters are more interesting and opens up one's mind. I asked my daughter to read some of the chapters and she was inspired. I found the reference section particularly appealing with one the books piquing my interest. [[ASIN:1897299354 What It Is]]. The book is a refreshing set of ideas and asks one to introspect.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it even though it was already old when it came out for kindle fire! it is very addictive! my nephews love this game!
B00000J7J4|5.0|Great comeback album for Santana.  Although for some of us he never left.  Rejoining his long time producer proved the two of them can make magic.  Wonderful CD which never gets tiresome.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is a real story! The movie is inspiring, I think every people who is suffering would love to watch it!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|The movie is great, seller was great...thanks a lot...<br />A great addition to my collection and great to watch before seeing the final installment.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I bought this book for my new kindle fire and have thoroughly enjoyed reading the first book in this triology.  I will certainly read the other two books
B003TML0VO|4.0|Enjoy listening to a maestro on guitar.  Santana plays like no one else alive.  His playing ability enlightens the soul and his renditions of these classics is remarkable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun and has creative games. the &quot;cost&quot; of new games is very original and a good idea that makes me want to play the game more often
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille  never fails to entertain.  &#34;The Panther&#34; is another great read.  Not as good as The Gold Coast, but definitely among his best to date and one I would recommend to others.  John Werner
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is an awesome book, wish there were more,  could not put them down, but it was a great book wood recommend this to anyone old enough to read it of corse
B001AP11KW|4.0|A Jack White project that somehow escaped me until now, with catchy tunes and good music. This post White Stripes group allows White  a fuller sound. It is a worthwhile effort.
0547884591|5.0|After the 4-hour work week and 4-hour body, I knew that if Tim's new book was anything like his others I wouldn't be able to put it down. This was exactly the case.<br /><br />I can only describe the book as full of useful information (cooking related and not)and pure entertainment:<br /><br />I love cooking, but am by no means an expert so I found his simple tips and recipes absolutely amazing. Of course, the learning aspect of book is something everyone should read. Enjoy cooking or not--EVERYONE has something they want to learn or be better at and Tim has a specific recipe down for doing just that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice big numbers,easy to use, a wonderful app. I use it just about everyday, works great on my kindle fire, no problems as of yet.
1476719071|4.0|Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. This was a book that didn't seem like pure fiction, this story could have been a real life romance. The twists and turns had me laughing, crying and truly hoping that love would be on their side. If you're looking for a book that will keep on the edge of your seat this is the one.
B009JCL58G|5.0|A Fantastic addition to my collection of scores! So beautifully composed and it all just flows together. Been listening to this on repeat for days now!! Highly Recommened!
B007P6VLRS|2.0|I like the album okay, but it's not one I'll go back to again and again. Nothing I'll call a classic, and there's no one song that really resonates with me. I'm a huge fan of Pumpkins' early work, Gish and Siamese Dream, with their symphonic highs and lows and crescendos.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is well written.  I was edified to read an intelligent after life experience.  As a person of faith I have a hope for anafter life but have often be skeptical of some of the differing experiences that I have read.  Proof of Heaven is a thinking persons experience of what one can expect in the next life and the author whos is a doctor provides medical explanations that rule out many of the alternative explanations.  This is a quick read.  I read it in one night.  It is a good read.  It  is well written.<br />And it is an inspiring read.  I highly recomend it to both believers and doubters alike.<br />Ric Oddone
B0063GORYU|5.0|lots of fun.  i really enjoy it. I win a lot and that is fun.  no fun if you cant win sometimes
B005SZAEYO|1.0|This just shows where we are as a culture. Crude, conditioned, and going down hill fast. What a perfect parallel of what our society is today.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Best album I've listened to all year. I have it on repeat. Ordering from Amazon is definitely recommended, saves you a trip to the store and if you're a big fan like me and get to have to album art inside the CD to put up on ur wall or desk at work! :]
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful application of draw something! everything works just like iPad or Android. The only problem is that when you finish drawing and the ads pop up, they dont go away. You have to close the app and open it again. Somewhat anoying. They'll probably fix it though :)
B0018QOIXU|3.0|I just recently discovered Adele and loved her 21 album.  I have to say her first album, 19, was half good, half whiny.  Overall, I liked the music and maybe it will grow on me after I listen to it some more.
B004IF8TLU|5.0|Just delightful.  Our family has enjoyed it more than once over the years.  The situations are clever, solutions<br />inventive and the cast is great.  Very entertaining.
0547884591|5.0|Although The 4-Hour Chef is about learning ANYTHING, it represents one of the best language learning books available. Like Tim's approach to income generation and physical prowess, his proposes language learning MED (minimum effective dose) helps lead language learners to conversational fluency far more quickly than traditional textbook-based approaches by focusing on the most important, high-leverage vocabulary and structures first.<br /><br />Even the parts of the book dedicated specifically to cooking, hunting, and sports can be applied to language learning, which contrary to popular belief, is more actually more physical than cognitive.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Workweek and 4-Hour Body are still two of my favorite books, but they pail in comparison to the 4-Hour Chef.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Walking along with &#34;Harold Fry&#34; was like seeing life unfolding in closeness and distance, laughter and sadness.<br />A gift for any one of us.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have not yet finished this book in the series (I'm about 2/3 of the way done), and I'm already dreading the fact that once it's over, that's it! I feel so wrapped up in the characters lives that I'm scared once it's over, I will feel like a part of MY life is missing! I have a feeling this will be a series I will read again and again! I'm not going to lie -- some of the writing is/was extremely cheesy (&#34;Oh my!&#34;) but the plot, and the emotions... I just love these books. I can't get enough!
B008RTE08E|3.0|I consider myself a big Beatles fan and had never seen this before. I wasn't expecting much due to reviews of previous incarnations of this movie so therefore I wasn't really disappointed in the movie itself. I mainly got this to rip the surround music tracks in order to make a Beatles surround compilation from this and other sources such as Yellow Submarine, Help, Anthology and the Love dvd audio. A Hard Days Night unfortunately had little in the surround channels. My complaints with MMT was that although they included a video clip for Hello Goodbye in the Extras it was only in stereo. I was also disappointed that they did not include the Strawberry Fields video clip at all in the extras.
B00992CF6W|4.0|pretty good game but still xbox 360 version is better and nothing can beat the Pc version of minecraft. its ok though
B005EHILV4|1.0|I will admit to being a newbie when it comes to recording gear. I've got a good idea about the other end of things, having been a theater projectionist for quite a few years and then going into installation work at a high-end home audio/home theater company.<br /><br />I tried to do my homework, read the reviews of the Behringer 302USB mixer, and thought that I would be able to get my home recording setup all finished up. Unfortunately, I found the same audible hiss that several other reviewers have mentioned, and after trying everything I could think of, I have returned this mixer to Amazon.<br /><br />As the other reviewers mentioned, even with no microphone connected, there was an audible hiss on any recording made on my PC, which immediately disappeared when I disconnected this mixed and tried recording the computer's mic-in both connected to a cheapie microphone and totally disconnected.<br /><br />I have, as others in the reviews here have mentioned, gone with the Mackie 402-VLZ3, which has even better reviews that this mixer, and has been mentioned as a serious step up in quality. I should get the Mackie tomorrow, and am hoping my tests are more successful than with this Behringer.
0545425115|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a good book that I recommend for others to read.  The book takes place in post apocalyptic North America \\"Panem\\", which is separated by what used to be 13 districts and the capital. Each year \\"The Capitol\\" of Panem holds what is known as the \\"Hunger Games\\". The theme of this book tells of how \\"large\\" governments love power and control over the \\"small\\" people.<br /> This  post apocalyptic  North America was created from nuclear warfare from when the 13 districts tried to rebel against the Capital of Panem, unfortunately this only resulted in the destruction of district 13, and the start of what is called the \\"Hunger Games\\". The Hunger Games is an annual event where 2 children (male and female) between the ages of 12-18 are selected from each of the remaining 12 districts to fight to the death until there is a winner.<br /> The story's main character, \\"Katniss Everdeen,\\" is chosen to partake in this event. She recognizes the male tribute she is partnered with as \\"Peeta Mallark\\". I really love the background between these two characters and how Suzanne Collins implements it into the story. After being chosen, Katniss has to travel to the competition and prepare for the oncoming slaughter of 23 innocent kids from each of the 12 districts. Throughout the book Katniss is put into many daring situations and you are always on the edge of your seat waiting for her next move. You will find yourself never being able to peal your eyes away from the book, even at the end of the chapters, it will make you want more and more until you are finished reading the book.<br /> I recommend this book to everyone out there not only because it was the best novel I have ever read but also because of Suzanne Collins excellent ability to get you hooked onto the book and her excellent word choice, its almost as if your brain is away watching a movie of the book as your eyes read it. I rate this book with a 5 out of 5 stars and hope you will read and enjoythis book as much as I do!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The is quite simply the greatest American film since Raging Bull.  A stunning, complete vision of what film can do to measure a world.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Vote my review unhelpful if you must, but I am being completely sincere when I say that using Ultraviolet is a complete hassle and not worth anyone's time.  Also, Amazon is for reviewing the entire product; this isn't freaking Rotten Tomatoes.  I feel my complaint is just, as many of you may if you rely on digital copies.<br /><br />You not only have to create an Ultraviolet account, but an account with each separate publisher, e.g. Warner, Fox, Disney, etc ad infinitum<br /><br />So, you end up with many many accounts.<br /><br />Then, you cannot actually download your movie.  You stream it.  So, while it IS technically a digital copy, it defeats the (oft) purpose of owning a digital copy, i.e. taking it with you on the go (think: airplane, long train ride, vacation, etc).<br /><br />Along the same lines, you thus are unable to play the movie on an iPod.  Also, don't even think about adding this to your iTunes collection-impossible.<br /><br />Fail. I will honestly never purchase a movie that has Ultraviolet<br /><br />Lastly, the movie is a great ending to the trilogy, and if this movie isn't on your list of must-owns already, then you should remedy that pronto =)
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I thought it was a good book and I'm waiting for a follow-up! I'm waiting<br />in anticipation for the story to continue!
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I enjoyed Into The Wild not only because of the true story behind it, but the way it changes your perception of the world and your place in it.  Chris's view of the world is unique, and we can all learn from it.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|You have to give it time, i am a big fun of this band and at first i really did not care for the songs maybe a few of them but after listening to the Cd a few times, it grows on you!  lyrics are awesome!
B009YU62H2|5.0|This album has grown on me over the last 10 days or so. I've listened to it at least one time per day and have realized that it is definitely Soundgarden and not just Chris or Audioslave influence standing out in the music.
B003TH14H4|5.0|The second season continues the flirtations between Castle and Beckett. Kudos to the the writers for being so versatile and entertaining.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Philippa Gregory brings the past to life in her wonderfully written books of this historical period.  A most prolific writer and spellbound story teller.

It does not involve a religion, imperial looting, or a company town. Did Doyle implicitly criticize a hereditary aristocracy that passed down evils to each generation? The character traits of the villain seem like those in true crime stories. Inheritance through murder has inspired other stories. There is one flaw in this story. How could the purchase of food for a giant hound be kept secret? Sherlock Holmes could question the grocers in the area to find the buyer of horse meat.lar of Doyle's four Sherlock Holmes novels.

B003THHIEM|5.0|Having come to Castle a little late in the game, It's always a pleasant surprise to find something worthwhile to view in Television land. The chemistry evoked by Beckett and Castle reminds me of Tracy and Hepburn films.
B00A7ZXH4O|2.0|This album was not that great. There were only a few songs that I thought were good. Her last 3 albums were way better than this one.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I have tried numerous cases and sleeves for my Kindle Fire HD, but this Marware Genuine Leather case is by far the best I have used. It truly is an excellent high end case for the Kindle Fire HD. The case looks great, and feels like a quality product. It allows you to rotate the Kindle to fit you viewing needs, so it's nice to be able to turn it any direction which watching a movie, reading an ebook, or playing a game. The leather case is tough and should last a while. It automatically puts your Kindle to sleep when closed, and you can have it set so the ports are protected or available for easy charging, etc...
B008KFS77U|4.0|I like this app. I have it on my phone, so it is great that it does work on the Kindle Fire. There is only one complaint, and I can't determine if it is my settings or not. The Wi-Fi will sometimes shut off and it is hard to get it back again. Otherwise, I have no problems with it. Of course it does not monitor 3G and stuff, but it can be turned off. I like the day and night modes, which helps the battery last longer.<br /><br />There are constant updates to strive to fix all bugs reported. Great developer.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|As you can probably tell by now I'm pretty much hooked. Thank You Amazon for providing me with the means to enjoy this show at my convenience.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|One of the best feel good movies out.  Something for every one.  I watch it every time it comes on and now bought it for my movie collection.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Would be better if it had a way of organizing files better otherwise okay for travel and need of documents.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|This was just plain boring. I felt like this was straight off of a formula board. I have read all his books.
6305428042|5.0|My favorite Halloween movie. We had this on VHS when my kids were little. It is still a favorite with them. It's not Halloween until we've watched it. The casting of the witches (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy) was a stroke of brilliance.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Really want to make this purchase, however, I made a purchase once with the Ultraviolet only \\"digital copy\\" (which is useless unless you have Internet access, when you're ready to watch). I had trouble viewing online, contacted their customer service and they were unwilling to give me a code for ITunes, so that I could at least view what I paid for.  Useless!  Unless I have the a true digital copy, I'm not paying for the movie.  These companies are crazy if they think I feel privileged to watch an online copy of a movie I already paid for, not to mention the fact that the movies expire online.  So much for \\"watch your movie anywhere, anytime\\".
B008QE9XD2|2.0|Tongue-n-cheek is funny, that cannot be said for the any of the so called humor in this film. The acting is at times just bad and the plot...well, was there a plot?
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This truck is awesome...well made...wonderful size for your young children...shipped really fast to me.  This truck is well worth the cost .
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Can re-watch this series over and over and still find something new every time. Praise to Joss Whedon for creating such a believable, enjoyable adventure.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|While I enjoy a good amount of Phil Collins' songs, only a handful get played on my media player. For only $5, if you can find 5 or 6 songs you like here you'll be ahead of the game. If you're a bigger Phil fan than me, than this album is a must.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|You feel for the characters even through you wished you didn’t.  Excellent read and must for all fantasy fans.  You will want more!
0316227706|5.0|A wonderful book, great photos.  I bought several copies as Christmas gifts for friends of mine who are dog lovers like me.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|All the tension, word play, stolen glances and touches between Castle and Beckett was worth the wait.  One of the best TV love scenes ever. Nothing overt, just enough, leaving a lot to the imagination.
B005LAII1C|5.0|There are clearly 14 stupid people who reviewed this movie poorly. It Ted were real he would make these idiots look so stupid for what they have said. This movie will be an instant classic. Most fun at the movies i have ever had and no other comedy has come close to Ted in a LONG time. Seth McFarland is a GENIUS and there NEEDS to be a sequel.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|The secret of the wings was a cute movie. The little girls liked it a lot but the boys wern't so keen on watching it. Was worth the money and keeping in my collection.
B00973DDN2|5.0|A fantastic album. I am a killers fan, I have never loved one of their albums so much. It's definitely one of their best.
B007HJ84WS|3.0|There is definitely enough eye-candy to watch for all sexes in this film! The script is not very exciting but the film manages to keep you glued to the screen.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|&#34;Lullaby&#34; is my favorite song on this album, followed by &#34;This Means War&#34;, &#34;Trying Not to Love You&#34; and &#34;When We Stand Together&#34;. &#34;Bottom's Up&#34; is also pretty awesome.<br /><br />I know Nickelback likes putting super-sexual songs on their albums and I've always enjoyed most of them...Their album &#34;Dark Horse&#34;, though, just had too many in that the songs started to feel too &#34;same-y&#34; if that makes sense.<br /><br />So that in mind, I have to say I REALLY enjoy the change of pace here with songs covering a variety of subject matters. There are a few sexy songs still of course--and they're great--but like I said, it's nice to see something different :)
B0053O89WY|5.0|We got hooked late on the Big Bang Theory and had already purchased the first four seasons. When we finished those we went looking for Season 5 and got screwed over by Best Buy so went looking for it on line and found it here at a great value. Thanks!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|An excellent book! Mike gets to the core of what most of us want with the title and doesn't stop there. A no nonsense approach from someone who's 'been there done that'. A book that cuts through all the nonsense, and deception, around supplements and tells you exactly what you have to do to get bigger leaner and stronger without drugs and without spending half your life in the gym. The bonus PDF lays out a whole years training and is good for any level. In fact, Mike says he still uses it himself. In short, the book is well worth the money, but what is priceless is the fact that Mike personally responds to any questions or concerns you might have. I started on the program a short time ago and I'm already seeing results. Can't wait to see what I look like in a year!

0375851569|5.0|Dr Seuss is great. He is a wonderful example of clever writing that appeals to adults as often as he does to children. I purchased these books for my grandchild because looking at them brought back such fond memories of reading them to my daughter.

0547884591|5.0|There have been very few books in my life that I struggled with to put down so I can go to bed on time. This is definitely one of them.<br /><br />Never has a cookbook kept me up at night.

B002PEP4SC|4.0|Generally, I thought I was reading a book version of the TV series, both of which I enjoyed.  Nothing too heavy, and the time passed well.  Glad to see that the attraction between the detective and the writer did not take forever to move to the next level.
B006ZS4QEM|5.0|Typical Lego product and always a big hit with my grandson.  This is a 3 in 1 Lego and a money saver for me.  My grandson loves building, taking apart, and building again so this really works for me.
B009FXIICK|5.0|My main game is chess... and I find Zookeeper DX to be a great change of pace that is nothing like chess. The game looks a bit retro and childish... but that doesn't detract from it. You switch the places of two zoo animal images (vertically or horizontally) to bring 3 or more into alignment... the aligned animals disappear and more slide down to take their place. And when this happens you gain more time on the timer. That may not sound like fun, but it is....the challenge is to keep coming up with the alignments to get enough animals to complete a level before the timer bar times out.  As the amount of time lessons, you are working under pressure to find a match... often you get one just in the nick of time. You can click on a binocular image twice to have some alignments pointed out to you.  When your time finally does run out the little boss guy appears with a static cartoon balloon showing his his words of criticism (these are not harsh... rather comical). The game has 2 modes.... the concept of play is the same for both.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always a great game to play when there is a little down time. Everyone loves a game of solitaire. GREAT GAME
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Loved it! The plot was beautiful and heartbreaking. This was a great find and a quick read. I was hungry for more before it was even over!
B000FC130E|5.0|One of the best books I think he's written, he manages to create an entire world you can see and smell and hear and feel-even sometimes when you'd rather not!-and he ends it in such a satisfying way. All in all a fabulous novel, I'd recommend to all Neil Gaiman fans and anyone who enjoys some dark fantasy with a right storyline and amazing characters
B009SQQRH2|1.0|I think it was pretty bad, not a good movie at all....Very slow moving so you kinda lose interest,It was hard to get through it

B0028IDXDS|5.0|This was the perfect binky for my son! As a newborn the monkey could lay on his chest and hold the pacifier in place until he figured out how to keep it in his mouth. He's now 8 weeks old and loves to snuggle with his little monkey friend. Very durable too! I just throw it into the washing machine every few days for a bath and he still looks like new. Super cute and well worth the money!!!
B0088WK27S|5.0|This story isn't for the faint of heart, it real and gritty, be prepared to face the atrocities of our world
B006Z7XNVK|4.0|Interesting movie, really atmospheric in a horribly creepy, dark way.  Not a mood lifter, but extremely well done!  Elizabeth Olsen is terrific.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Didnt pay the extra dollar for the HD and the picture was still just as good :) Great movie also.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Come on EL James. . . How many times a day can any two human beings have sex?  Much is repetitive. . . but I bet the author is laughing all the way to the bank.  This is the best of the three because they become more &#34;human&#34; or &#34;normal&#34; in their thoughts.  In other words, the main character, Christian Gray, finally grows up a little to realize that the world is not totally about his needs. It certainly was beyond time for Mr. Gray to get over his &#34;tragic&#34; early childhood.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app. It has so many features! I like the visual representation of the hard drive showing the percentage charged and the plug icon to let you know its being charged. It also shows you how long it will take to charge via usb or plug,  and how long you can use the phone. Works great on Samsung S3.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|i LOVEd LOVED LOVED the previous album so I was super excited to get this one too.  At the first listen, I wasn't in love with it, but it has grown on me.  Maybe it'll last longer in my &#34;LOVE IT&#34; section of my collection with the growing on quality?
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game is easy enough for my 6 year daughter to play, but before I knew about the parenting blocks my daughter bought the scoops and bags of jewels. Make sure those parental locks are on with this game!!! Thank goodness we got our money refunded to us....some scoops are 1.99 and goes clear up to 99.99......really 99.99 for something in a game....REDICULOUS!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book in the series From Vince Flynn. I have read the entire Rapp series. Want the next one now
0486474917|5.0|Frankly, classic novels terrify me a little bit. And it's been a looooong time since I voluntarily picked one up to read (and as we're all good friends here and in a safe circle, I must admit that I made it through about 5 pages of the last one...Wuthering Heights...before placing back on my bookshelf and walking away slowwwly so as not to anger it). So, I decided to read Sherlock with hesitant excitement - you see, I'm a sucker for British crime drama, which is furthered drastically when Robert Downey Jr. is involved in my mental picture of the main character.<br /><br />But I digress...<br /><br />Sherlock started out a bit slowly for me (as classics tend to do). It took me about an adventure and a half to get used to Doyle's formal writing style. But once I got the hang of the lingo, it was smooth sailing from there. True, many of the 12 adventures were very similar to each other - almost a same story, different time sort of thing - but I still loved it. Sherlock is a charming nutcase, and I loved seeing Watson go along with all of his best buddy's strangely genius ideas.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|1.  i like the musician, esp. since he's from MN (me too).<br />2. it's nice to hear music that is booth well made and has positive lyrics.

B005G5PPGS|5.0|This was a real fun read.  I had seen the movie and loved it, so I wanted to read the story. I'm very glad I did. I also learned why TV, print, and radio dweebs spout so many tedious and uninteresting statistics, aside from the ever present fear of dead air.

B009AJDDQU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie though it was a little slow moving, I guess it was truly more Sci-fi than action. Has some cool throwbacks to the Alien movies but did leave some open ends/unanswered questions that I would have liked to had explained better.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Amazing CD bought it by accident and have fallen in love with it. I would recommend this CD to everyone!!!!!
0385536828|5.0|One thing I enjoy about what we call - for lack of any other way to refer to it - postmodern literature, is the tinkering with structure, and McEwan is a master of that talent. Too, he, like most gifted writers, is a student of human tics, psychology, the subtleties that make us unique, and he's clearly mastered gifting his characters with such uniquenesses. But to the story:<br /><br />A young woman, Serena Frome, is hired by Britain's MI5 to award a young writer, Tom Haley, with a money grant in order to, hopefully, groom him, as he rises in literary prominence, to take a politically acceptable posture in his writing. But Serena immediately falls for Tom, and as their relationship grows to mutual love, she wrestles with the ethical dilemma of whether to inform her lover of her clandestine part in his good fortune. Tom does rise - immediately - to prominence in Brit literature, but that puts additional strains on  Serena as her role in his life is laid bare.<br /><br />If this sounds like a rather pedestrian storyline, don't let it dissuade you from reading Sweet Tooth. Why? Because the book is as accurate a portrait of British life in the early `sixties as one could conjure. It's filled with secrecy, ideological overreach, the beginnings of the sexual revolution, and the still-chauvinistic attitude of men toward women. And let's not forget booze, dope and rock `n' roll. It's also a meditation on writing, the writer's life, the necessary subtleties of novels and short stories that make them worth reading, and on publishing then and now. In the end, though, the seemingly pedestrian storyline isn't really McEwan's at all. We'll let you read the book to resolve that mysterious statement.<br /><br />There is one aspect at the beginning that this reader fails to appreciate: an overlong paraphrasing of a novel Serena has read. But McEwan's literary and storytelling gifts are many, and they completely overwhelm such a minor quibble.<br /><br />My rating: 18 of 20 stars

B005RUV0NY|5.0|Heard good thins on this show and went out on a limb by purchasing the first season. I was hooked within 3 episodes and continued by buying the second season and the individual episodes that have aired in the 3rd season. Now that I'm caught up I just use my DVR.

B004U8VWLE|1.0|I guess I should have read more about the film before I saw it.  I thought the movie was about a dancer whose understudy, desperate for the part, starts doing things that make the dancer think she's going crazy. But it turns out (SPOILER ALERT), the dancer really IS crazy.  The film was filled with icky and disturbing gross-out scenes that really weren't necessary.  Striving for perfection causing a ballerina to slowly go crazy is a valid plot, and they could have done something with that, but they went about it all the wrong way.<br /><br />I like \\"art-house\\" movies and even some film noire, and a film doesn't have to have a good ending (or even be entirely clear) for me to appreciate it.  But even though the acting was good, the dancing was good, and, of course, the music was good, I really can't say I gained anything by watching this film.  I rarely give movies just one star, but I genuinely did hate this film.

0307887448|5.0|Just a great mix of cyberpunk, 80s nostalgia, general geekery, virtual worlds, and gaming. But then, in this day and age, even cyberpunk is nostalgia ... If you grew up in the 80s, the pop-culture and gaming references can get pretty melancholy ... but otherwise, a fast read that, as several other reviewers have commented, you don't want to end. Been awhile since a book has grabbed me this way ([[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]] certainly did). Would definitely look forward to more by the author as long as it contained the same mix of nostalgia and dystopia ...
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|For many people who grew up in the '80s, \\"21 Jump Street\\" was the ultimate ensemble cop show.<br /><br />Aimed at a younger generation, the crime drama series was part of the beginning of the FOX network, which fascinated many people for its youthful or politically incorrect television series and in the case of \\"21 Jump Street\\", many were fascinated by its stars.<br /><br />Created by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannel, \\"21 Jump Street\\" would star young talents Johnny Depp, Holly Robinson, Peter DeLuise, Dustin Nguyen, Frederic Forrest, Steven Williams, Richard Grieco and many more. The concept of the series would be about police officers with youthful appearances and thus, would allow them to be undercover cops in high schools and colleges to investigate drug trafficking and abuse.<br /><br />The series would air in 1987 through 1991 with a total of  103 episodes.  Fast forward to 2008, Columbia Pictures would have the rights to the film adaptation of the series and actors Jonah Hill (\\"Superbad\\", \\"Moneyball\\", \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\") and Michael Bacall (\\"Inglourious Basterds\\", \\"Grindhouse\\", \\"Pumpkin\\") would be responsible for writing the story.  And in Hill's words, his goal was to create an \\"R-rated, insane, \\"Bad Boys\\" meets John Hughes type movie\\".<br /><br />Tapped to direct the film were writing duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller (\\"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\\", \\"Clone High\\" and co-executive producers of the TV sitcom \\"How I Met Your Mother\\").<br /><br />The film would be a departure from the original TV series which was created as a drama series with a moral message.  The film adaptation would be more of an action comedy film and instead of featuring a group, it would focus on two police officers played by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (\\"The Vow\\", \\"Dear John\\", \\"Step Up\\").<br /><br />And the film which was budgeted at $42 million would become a success for Columbia Pictures/MGM/Original Film as it would earn over $192 million in the box office and also receive positive reviews from film critics.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"21 Jump Street\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  For video quality, it appears that there was an intentional decision by cinematographer Barry Peterson (\\"Jumper\\", \\"Zoolander\\", \\"Starsky & Hutch\\") to shoot the film with more subdued colors.  So, the creative decision to go that direction leads to a warmer, subdued, dare I say a little softer look at times.  But there are also scenes that look brighter and darker and if anything, it works for the film.  Black levels are nice and deep, details are good but the film is not vibrant as one may hope for it to be.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"21 Jump Street\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French, Spanish, Thai, English-Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As one would expect from a film with plenty of action, the lossless soundtrack for \\"21 Jump Street\\" is fantastic.  From gun shots, explosions, crunching metal to you name it...there is wonderful use of the surround channels and LFE.  Dialogue is crisp and clear and even the music sounds fantastic!  Overall, listeners will enjoy the immersive soundscape of those action sequences during their viewing of the film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese Mandarin (Traditional and Simplified), Indonesian/Bahasa, Korean and Thai.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"21 Jump Street\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.<br />  Deleted Scenes - (29:32) Featuring 20 deleted scenes.<br />  Gag Reel - (4:58) Featuring outtakes from \\"21 Jump Street\\".<br />  Cube-O-Rama - (1:53) Featuring Ice Cube scenes and improv not featured in the final cut of the film.<br />  Back to School - (7:45) Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Neil Moritz (producer) talk abut going back to high school, its storyline and how the film came to be.<br />  Brothers in Arms - (11:30) Producer Neil Moritz, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum talk about their action sequences and casting two opposites.<br />  Johnny Depp on Set - (4:42) Directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord along with the cast talk about Johnny Depp's cameo in the film and their thoughts when they saw him appear on the set.<br />  The Rob Riggle Show - (9:24) A featurette on Rob Riggle and how he was cast for the film.<br />  Peter Pan on Freeway - (4:12) A featurette of the shooting of the freeway scene.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"21 Jump Street\\" comes with an UltraViolet code to allow for streaming to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Prior to \\"21 Jump Street\\" being released to theaters, I was dreading the film.<br /><br />Why?  Because I was one of those teenagers in the '80s who loved \\"21 Jump Street\\" on television.  I wanted to dress like Officer Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Officer Harry Truman Ioki (Dustin Nguyen) and the show was a big part of my teenage life.  When Depp sported the '70s vintage watch strap with no watch, I did the same.  When, Nguyen sported a certain hairstyle, I did the same. I would listen to the \\"21 Jump Street\\" soundtrack over and over and would have VHS tape of TV recordings of the series.<br /><br />So, suffice to say, when you hear Jonah Hill will be writing \\"21 Jump Street\\", I kept asking \\"Why?\\".<br /><br />And now, having watched \\"21 Jump Street\\", I have to say that I really enjoyed this hilarious film.  Yes, it deviates from the TV series that it is more comedy-driven, a lot of crude and sexual content and humor, but it works.  And instead of the ensemble cast, it becomes more of the police buddy movie that has been done before, but with even more crazy comedy and humor that overshadows similar police buddy comedy films such as \\"Rush Hour\\", \\"Starsky & Hutch\\" or \\"The Other Guys\\".<br /><br />And of course, it's written by Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall, two men who know crude comedy that works for today's generation.  For example, in one scene, both men were forced to take the synthetic drug and in order to make themselves to vomit it out, both subject themselves to fingering each other's mouths. Or another scene where the drug reaches its height with the character of Schmidt, and during a track meet run, uses the baton and pretends it's his own penis.  There are so many crazy, gut-busting scenes that made me laugh out loud and the comedy works.  Especially one hilarious, gross out scene at the end of the film involving actor Rob Riggle, which you don't see coming.<br /><br />And \\"21 Jump Street\\" is a film that allows Ice Cube to get back to the character with so many F-bombs, it's so crazy!<br /><br />But what lends to the film's efficacy is the unknown.  Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are the unlikely police duo, similar to how Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg were in \\"The Other Guys\\" but not as annoying and much more funnier.  \\"21 Jump Street\\" taps into the opposites attract and with this unlikely bromance, Hill and Tatum played their characters wonderfully.  And considering the film has made so much money, there is no doubt that we will see a sequel.<br /><br />As for the old \\"21 Jump Street\\" TV series, fans also get to see Johnny Depp, Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson Peete play their original characters.  While some talents are shown on a TV screen, this small homage to the TV series also made me wonder if the character Greg Jenko (Tatum) had any relation to the short-lived \\"21 Jump Street\\" character Captain Richard Jenko from the TV series.<br /><br />So, while the \\"21 Jump Street\\" film adaptation was much different from the TV series, as a fan of the original TV series, I'm glad there were major differences but also managed to interject some of the show into the film, especially showcasing the bromance between original characters Officer Tom Hanson (Depp) and Officer Doug Penhall (DeLuise) and with Schmidt and Jenko.  More or less, the passing of the baton of one era to another.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, while video quality was good, I wish it was more vibrant but I understand the more dimmer look of the film was possibly a creative decision.  As for the audio, the lossless soundtrack is fantastic.  And there are also many short special features included on the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"21 Jump Street\\" was a gut-busting, piss in your pants type of action comedy film.  I was dreading the film as a die-hard fan of the original TV series but by the end of the film, I enjoyed it so much that I can't wait for the sequel!

B009NQKPUW|5.0|Loved this movie. Had great visuals and would love to see this in 3-D. The last few minutes of the movie was the best surprise.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I own all the Rovio (5 Angry Birds, Bad Piggies, and Amazing Alex)games for the Kindle Fire. Rovio does try its' best to get the updates for all the different devices at the same time, I am OK having to wait longer for it to come to the Kindle Fire, sometimes. I understand that it takes time for them to make each game for all the devices.<br />The Angry Birds Star Wars is by far my favorite. It uses the physics of AB Space in some levels and regular AB in other levels. I love the special powers of the birds and that the levels are interesting and challenging. The Path of the Jedi can be unlocked for an extra $1.99 but of you get three stars in the first two planets it unlocks for free. I bought the Path of the Jedi and beat those levels first because it gave me extra power for the Luke Skywalker Bird and the Obi-Wan bird during completion of the levels. Luke's power is increased at the end of the level. It is an awesome game and will patiently wait for the update.<br /><br />Update:<br />My app updated with the new Moon of Endor levels (1.4.1). I played them and three starred on all the levels. Today my app updated and reverted back to 1.3.1, cloud city update. I worked hard on the Endor levels and now they are gone. I am an unhappy fan. Hope it is fixed soon and I don't have to redo the levels.
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|The movie has two distinct acts (think of \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\"). Act-I: similar to the movie \\"Duel\\" but with good looking teenagers.  Act-II: a monster \\"chase'um down\\".  The film ends with a very non-traditional, but satisfying, ending (think \\"Twilight Zone\\" TV show).<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is far superior to the original DVD release.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|When it comes to action films, Luc Besson definitely knows how to entertain the masses.<br /><br />From films such as \\"The Fifth Element\\", \\"Leon: The Professional\\", \\"Taken\\", the \\"Taxi\\" films to name a few, Besson is well-known for his films. He's also known as a man who gives people chances to shine in his film, not just as acting talent but also as part of the crew.<br /><br />For the 2012 film \\"The Lockout\\", Besson produced co-wrote the screenplay for the film with co-directors/co-writers James Mather and Stephen St. Leger (the film would be the duo's directorial debut).<br /><br />The film would star Guy Pearce (\\"Memento\\", \\"L.A. Confidential\\", \\"The Hurt Locker\\"), Maggie Grace (\\"Lost\\", \\"Taken\\", \\"Knight and Day\\") and Vincent Regan (\\"300″, \\"Troy\\", \\"Unleashed\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Lockout: Unrated Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray!  From the opening scene of seeing the stubble on Guy Pearce's chin to the closeup of Maggie Grace's eye.  And the fact that a lot of the film's settings are CG, there resolution is high and detail is fantastic.  It's important to note that the film is more on the cool side, as the film is shot in a metallic structure of blues and grays.  But overall, \\"Lockout: Unrated Edition\\" looks impressive!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Lockout: Unrated Edition\\" is presented in English, Italian, Portugues 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And as one can expect from a Besson-related film, that is plenty of action.  There are explosions galore, gunshots galore, metal breaking apart, people being slammed, a chase scene... the lossless soundtrack for \\"Lockout\\" is immersive, chaotic and for audiophiles, they will love the immersiveness of this film.  Dialogue is crystal clear, music and special effects are crystal clear, great use of surround channels and LFE.  Impressive!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Lockout\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Breaking Into Lockout - Making Of - (11:07) Featuring the directors and cast talking about their characters and working on the film.<br />  A Vision of the Future - Production Design & Special Effects - (10:13) Interview with Frank Walsh (Supervising Art Director), Oliver Hooge (Art Director) and richard Bain (Visual Effects Supervisor) talking about the visual effects of the film and the use of green screen.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Lockout: Unrated Edition\\" comes with a slipcase plus an UltraViolet code for instantly stream or download to PC or Mac.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Guy Pearce has been given new life as the action hero Snow in the film \\"Lockout\\".  While directed by James Mather and Stephen St. Leger, \\"Lockout\\" has the look and feel of a frenetic Besson popcorn action film!<br /><br />\\"Lockout\\" takes the banal concept of things go wrong in prison and it's up to one man to save the day.  Seems very Jack Bauer (for those familiar with \\"24″) but the prison is set in space and instead of grungy concrete walls, you get metallic, danky prison settings, we are given a green screen CGI futuristic prison setting which actually looks very cool!<br /><br />In fact, the sci-fi futuristic visuals are well-done.  The visual effects crew were very good in focusing on creating a sci-fi look and feel of the film.  But working entirely in green screen also presents a major problem with the fact that many actors have problems in acting when no one is there and reacting when nothing is around you but green. They have to trust the director and crew and it's not the easiest thing to do for an actor.<br /><br />And so, this presents the problem of \\"Lockout\\", the acting.  While I thought the wisecracking, stoic Snow worked well for Guy Pearce, anyone wanting more depth with his character will be sadly disappointed.  If there was anything that really didn't make sense or work is the one man having to infiltrate the prison to save the President's daughter.  One man?  President's daughter?  Farfetched isn't it? For some people, it was.<br /><br />But audiences should know by now, Luc Besson films are popcorn action films that are not meant to be taken to seriously.<br /><br />From \\"La Femme Nikita\\", \\"Leon: The Professional\\" and even the \\"Taxi\\" films, these films revolved around a single person getting involved in some trouble but yet managing to save the day despite the odds or how crazy things may seem.<br /><br />It's like watching a Roland Emmerich film, you know there will be tons of action and a lot of destruction in the world.  No way should one expect anything deep or romantic, you just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />I am in awe to read some people who felt disappointed that \\"Lockout\\" was not mentally challenging or there was not enough bloody violence.  And once again, I bring up the fact that this is a Luc Besson film.  This is not a David Fincher film, nor is it a banal horror film.  The film is about one man trying to save the President's daughter and get the hell out of the prison.<br /><br />The antagonists are angry prison inmates and the callousness of some of these inmates are shown effectively (many innocent people randomly) and yes, even the president's daughter, Emilie, played by Maggie Grace, the scared and fearful hostage (although, we have seen this before for Maggie Grace in Besson's other film \\"Taken\\" and wouldn't be surprised if we see the same type of emotions coming from the character in the upcoming \\"Taken 2″).<br /><br />But the fact is that these films are never meant to be serious, they are popcorn action films, nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, I'm not entirely sure what scenes are unrated as the original runtime is 95 minutes and the unrated version is 95 minutes.  But I can say the film looks absolutely fantastic in HD courtesy of its CG environment.  Closeups are full of detail, such as one scene where you can see the stubble of Pearce so clearly, or even the detailed cuts of a character.  The film looks excellent on Blu-ray and it has a lossless soundtrack that is also quite immersive, considering the many action scenes.  The disappointment was mainly of its two only special features.  An audio commentary or more special features other than two, would have been nice to have on this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Lockout\\" was a film that I enjoyed.  And for those who enjoy popcorn action films, especially films in futuristic settings will definitely enjoy \\"Lockout: Unrated Edition\\".at really didn't make sense or work is the one man having to infiltrate the prison to save the President's daughter.

030758836X|3.0|I was really excited to read this, after all the good press I read. I bought all 3 of her novels at one go, and read this first. While it was enjoyable and well-written, I felt that it lacked real thrill. Flynn tries to go deep into the psyches of the main characters, building up the story, but the ending feels flat. I guessed the first twist about 20 pages in ('Double Jeopardy,' anyone?) and waited for a bigger one, which didn't really come. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable story to read, though the other characters (Desi, police officers, Margo) could have been made more 3-dimensional. I think this would translate well into a movie, in a skilled director's hands, as the audience can be kept guessing as to the real natures of Nick, Amy and their relationship.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Rented this for a family night for $3.99 I believe it was, for that price it was good and I'm glad I did not take the family out to the movies to see it when it was in the theater.  It's basically just ok. Animation was up there but the story felt forced, nothing special or surprising about it.  Kids will like it enough and be entertained and adults can tolerate it especially for the rental price but I would not add this one to your collection.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I liked this movie. It had a lot of humor and was a romantic comedy. Since I love romantic comedies, I ignored the grumpy persona of Harrison Ford in this film. It definitely is not one of his shining roles, but he played the part well. If you like romantic comedies and movies where the uphill challenge is accomplished, you will like this movie.
B007JNR4XW|4.0|Anne Fletcher appeared as a dancer on films such as \\"The Flinstones\\", \\"The Mask\\" and \\"Tank Girl\\" but she also developed the choreography for \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"A Life Less Ordinary\\".<br /><br />Although best known as a choreographer, in 2006, Fletcher received the opportunity to direct her first film.  That film would be \\"Step Up\\" (2006), a $12 million dance/romance film starring unknown talent at the time, Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan.<br /><br />Suffice to say, \\"Step Up\\" was an amazing success despite critics panning it.  \\"Step Up\\" earned over $119 million in the box office and since the release of the movie, there are now a total of four \\"Step Up\\" films, Anne Fletcher has gone to direct films such as \\"27 Dresses\\" and \\"The Proposal\\", Channing Tatum became a big movie star (\\"Public Enemies\\", \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\", \\"21 Jump Street\\", \\"The Vow\\", \\"Magic Mike\\") and Jenna Dewan (\\"The Playboy Club\\", \\"Melrose Place\\", \\"The Grudge 2″) would go on to marry her co-star and is now known as Jenna Dewan-Tatum.<br /><br />The film would star R&B singer Mario (\\"Freedom Writers\\"), a a young Alyson Stoner (\\"Camp Rock\\" films, \\"Step Up 3D\\", \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\", voice actress for \\"Phineas and Ferb\\"),  Rachel Griffiths (\\"Blow\\", \\"Brothers & Sisters\\", \\"Six Feet Under\\"), Drew Sidora (\\"Wild Hogs\\", \\"Never Die Alone\\", \\"White Chicks\\"), Damaine Radcliff (\\"Glory Road\\", who does the visual effects now for \\"Supah Ninjas\\"), De'Shawn Washington and the late Heavy D.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Step Up\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Having watched this film several times, especially for the dance choreography, I can easily say that the film looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  From the cinematography of the talented Michael Seresin (\\"Harry Potter and the Prison of Azkaban\\", \\"Midnight Express\\", \\"The Life of David Gale\\", \\"Sleeping Dogs\\"), Seresin is known for capturing action and despair.  For this film, he manages to capture inner-street culture, beautiful scenery as both Tyler and Nora are above a building top overlooking the harbor but most importantly capturing dance choreography and making things look smooth.<br /><br />The video quality for this 2006 film looks good especially during the dance scenes which utilize a lot of different lights and coloring.  If anything, Seresin uses lighting effectively throughout the film.  Skin tones look natural, I was expecting to possibly see banding during the more intensive red lighting but everything looked great. Black levels were nice and deep and I detected no banding, DNR or artifacting during my viewing of the entire film.<br /><br />The clarity of the Blu-ray release over the original DVD release is quite noticeable and fans of the film should be happy with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Step Up\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  First and foremost, \\"Step Up\\" is a film that is primarily dialogue and music-driven.  While there are some scenes such as broken glass or even a gun shot, dialogue is crystal clear as with the music which utilizes bass, cool beats and also scenes with crowd ambiance (especially during the final sequence).  The lossless soundtrack is quite appropriate for this film and fans who enjoyed the film before, will enjoy the clarity of the music on Blu-ray!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Step Up\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Deleted Scenes - A total of seven deleted scenes including an optional deleted scenes commentary track by director Anne Fletcher.<br />  Bloopers - (1:36) Outtakes from \\"Step Up\\".<br />  Making the Movie - (4:39) Director Ann Fletcher talks about being a choreographer and working with a talented team including the choreographers who helped prepapre the talent for the film.  Interviews with cast and Benny the choreographer.<br />  Music Videos - Featuring the following music videos \\"Step Up\\" by Samantha Jade, \\"(When You Gonna) Give It Up to Me\\" by Sean Paul feat. Keyshia Cole, \\"Say Goodbye\\" by Chris Brown and \\"Get Up\\" Ciara feat. Chamillionaire.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Having watched the \\"Step Up\\" films evolve since the original, I felt that the films have become more of an emphasis on choreography than story.  Which is not a bad thing if you tend to watch dance films wanting to see more choreography, but \\"Step Up\\" is one of those films that you look back and say to yourself, \\"Channing Tatum was pretty awesome in that movie\\".<br /><br />Sure, we are so used to seeing Channing Tatum as action hero or romantic lead but \\"Step Up\\" was an earlier work that did show some potential for the actor.  To tell you the truth, he seemed so natural as a dancer and you just don't see that happening with a lot of movie stars, who typically train for the role and have a body double.<br /><br />But not for this film.<br /><br />This is where Anne Fletcher's strength as a choreographer is effective.  She knows how fake dance films can be when the actual talents are not being used and in this case, she made sure that the cast was well-selected and most importantly, she envisioned how the choreography would be and have her staff prepare for the talent for those scenes.  Both Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan look natural, feel natural and it made the film work.  I actually liked the blending of ballet and hip-hop choreography.<br /><br />But with that being said about the choreography, what about the film and the acting?<br /><br />Haven't we been there before with the 2001 film \\"Save the Last Dance\\".  Ballerina hooks up with a tough guy from the wrong side of the city.  Granted, Channing Tatum is not Black but there is a banality of films about rich girl, poor guy/bad boy hooking up.<br /><br />Also, I've described Channing Tatum's acting as stiff, not recently but more of his past films.  But I will say unlike \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\", Tatum is more in his element it seems for \\"Step Up\\" and by no means is his dancing stiff.  The guy can pop, dance and still shows a little bit of that when I was reviewing the Blu-ray of \\"21 Jump Street\\" earlier in the week.<br /><br />The thing is, he has grown as an actor since this film but the character role of Tyler, a troubled teen from a troubled home, Tatum made it work!<br /><br />Aside from banality, there are some issues of pacing and for more serious viewers, some may feel the subplot involving Miles Darby (as portrayed by Mario) and Lucy Avila (as portrayed by Drew Sidora) as unnecessary.  In a way, it was because these characters were not fleshed out all that well.  They are more diversions, where at least Miles contributes to the music, Lucy Avila is more of the friend who keeps egging her friend Nora to go for Tyler.  But when it comes to their friendship, the storyline falls apart and feels forced as if the film needed to increase the time of duration.  In fact, there is a storyline that involves Nora's boyfriend/ex-boyfriend Brett Dolan (as portrayed by Josh Henderson) and it seems as if he could be an intriguing rival to Tyler but his character disappears by the second half of the film.<br /><br />If anything, I wish more was explored into the life of Tyler Gage at home or even with his friends, otherwise this film really needed fine tuning with its supporting characters.<br /><br />But despite a few of the problems that the film had, I did enjoy it.  And it did make a tremendous amount of money and definitely set made things brighter for both Channing Tatum and director Anne Fletcher and many more \\"Step Up\\" films to come.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, for those who own the previous DVD, the special features are the same but the difference is better clarity on video and better sound quality thanks to the lossless soundtrack.  And if you love the film, the upgrade is definitely worth it.<br /><br />Overall,  \\"Step Up\\" may notbe an original or even a great dance film, but I still enjoyed the dance choreography and the bad boy meets rich girl storyline.  Back when this film came out, I had low expectations.  But after watching it, I realized that \\"Step Up\\" is one of the better dancing films out there.  And since the release of this film, compared to the other \\"Step Up\\" films that have been released, \\"Step Up\\" still has the better storyline.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the film or love dancing films, \\"Step Up\\" is definitely worth owning on Blu-ray!e of Cobra\\", Tatum is more in his element it seems for \\"Step Up\\" and by no means is his dancing stiff.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Oh that 20 years should roll around annually for Michael Connelly...as that's the time that has elapsed since he dropped the first Harry Bosch protagonist novel on us until now. Fans of the series will be glad to know that this edition is lovingly crafted, extremely well plotted, and given the care that some of the other tomes did not receive. Connelly pushes himself out of his comfort zone (he could write about L.A. in his sleep) and sends his hero on a well-crafted cold case search that spans the globe. Too bad Clint Eastwood has retired from working in front of the camera, because its a rare actor who can play a man of few words, such as Bosch, with such grace, elan, and conviction. If there are any flaws in the book it's that Connelly has a more difficult time painting the relationship btwn Harry and his daughter Maddie, especially now that she is a teen. Harry loves her unconditionally, as any good father, but he still has a hard time knowing how to treat her, and the fits and starts don't always flow onto the page as they should. Second, as much as I love jazz, the author is a little \\"preachy\\" about it (as is Mr. Eastwood for that matter, another reason he'd be such a good fit). On that I can forgive him a little, b/c it is very hard to adequately translate the rapture of music into the written word. It shouldn't be long now and publishers we'll be able to include a little embedded chip on a page that will play a few bars of a tune so the reader can get in sync with the author. All said, this is a fine edition to the series, and a page turner in its own right. Enjoy!

B007I1TFK0|4.0|On July 26, 1952, a 33-year-old woman named Maria Eva Durarte de Peron would become part of international pop culture.  On that very day, the second wife of Argentina President Juan Peron and the First Lady of Argentina would pass away due to cancer.  And her memory continues to live on today!<br /><br />Eva \\"Evita\\" Peron, her story has captured the attention of people worldwide.  Growing up poor, leaving her family at the age of 15 from a rural village to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires, hoping to pursue a career as an actress and at the age of 25, meeting then-Colonel Juan Peron at a charity event for earthquake victims, the two would marry a year later.<br /><br />And Juan Peron would become President of Argentina, but as the First Lady, Eva would become powerful within the trad unions, speaking on behalf of labor rights, running the Ministries of Labor and Health, running her own charity and showing that a woman can be come a true leader.  She was championed by the low-income and working class of Argentina and despite her ailing health, she continued to remain strong despite being opposed by Argentina's military and the upperclass.<br /><br />So, popular Evita was in international pop culture, a 1981 telefilm titled \\"The Woman with the Whip\\" starring Faye Dunaway was created.  And also a successful musical production titled \\"Evita\\" by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber would once again pay tribute to Eva Peron.  So, successful that the musical generated over $2 billion in revenue back in 1980.<br /><br />But since 1978, there was always hope to bring \\"Evita\\" to the big screen and after a 20-year production delay, in 1996, director and co-writer Alan Parker (\\"Angela's Ashes\\", \\"Mississippi Burning\\", \\"Angel Heart\\") and co-writer Oliver Stone (\\"Platoon\\", \\"JFK\\", \\"National Born Killers\\") were able to take Evita to the big screen thanks to the casting of Madonna (\\"Body of Evidence\\", \\"A League of their Own\\", \\"Dick Tracy\\"), Antonio Banderas (\\"Desperado\\", \\"The Mask of Zorro\\", \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\\") and Jonathan Pryce (\\"Brazil\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" films).<br /><br />\\"Evita\\" is a musical narrated by Che (as portrayed by Antonio Banderas), who tells the story of Eva Duarte (as portrayed by Madonna) from a child of a poor family, leaving her home to become an actress in Buenos Aires, where she would have an affair with Agustin Magaldi (as portrayed by Jimmy Nail) but eventually, through an earthquake benefit, meeting Colonel Juan Peron (as portrayed by Jonathan Pryce) and a year later, marrying him.<br /><br />The musical would show audiences the rise and power of Juan Peron as he becomes Argentina's President and how the First Lady of Argentina together, would create a new government that would serve the poor.<br /><br />But through her hard work, Che narrates her sickness and leading to her death.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1).  When I first watched this film years ago, I noticed how this film looked so beautiful, so grand because of the many people that were featured.  The eloquence of showcasing Eva Peron throughout her life but also amongst the political chaos to the thousands of people who supported her and of course, her husband.  But the cinematography of Darius Khondji (\\"Se7en\\", \\"Midnight in Paris\\", \\"Alien: Resurrection\\") is beautiful.<br /><br />Compared to the original DVD release, the film features much more clarity, much more detail but it is a film that utilizes a lot of earth tones, so colors are warmer than vibrant.  The video is definitely an upgrade from the original DVD and fans of the film will definitely want to upgrade for the improve picture quality.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film is a musical and with a musical, you expect it to sound incredible via lossless. And as expected, the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber sounds incredible in HD.  While primarily a dialogue and music-driven film through the front channels, I didn't notice the surround channels being used as much but towards the end of the film, I did notice a bit of LFE.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  The Making of Evita - (42:13)  A documentary featuring behind-the-scenes making of the film, interviews with the cast, director and knowings the challenges that existed in bringing this musical to the big screen but also the challenges that Madonna and talents had to face as well.  As well as the importance of location, look and costume design.  Very informative feature.<br />  Music Video - (3:16) Featuring Madonna's \\"You Must Love Me\\".<br />  Teaser Trailer - (1:54) A teaser trailer for \\"Evita\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Whenever I hear the song \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\", I think of Madonna singing this song on the balcony, as her character of Eva Peron, knowing that her final days are coming and just wanting to say one last goodbye to the people who have supported her.<br /><br />\\"Evita\\" is a musical that I enjoyed for its ambition and cinematography.  To shoot in Argentina, to include so many extras to make the political rallying and the funeral of Evita seem real, this was accomplished remarkably well in the film.<br /><br />Madonna does a fantastic job in playing the main character role of Evita.  From the look and the emotion, Madonna was able to bring sexiness but also an emotional demeanor to her character with efficacy.  And of course, hearing her sing, I absolutely enjoyed her songs.<br /><br />But not everyone's songs.<br /><br />Antonio Banderas was fine as the narrator, Che, who in the movie, was close to the Peron's, and as much as I enjoyed Antonio Banderas in \\"Desperado\\" (and \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\\") and the \\"Zorro\\" films, he is more of an action star in my book.  Not as a singer.  And as much as Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice really tried to bring out the machismo of Banderas through music, I wasn't so much of a fan of Banderas' singing vocals for the film then and the same now.<br /><br />And while Jonathan Pryce is a fine actor, I just didn't feel the chemistry was right between Pryce and Madonna.  So perhaps, the casting never set well with me to begin with.  And watching this film again in 2012, I still feel the same way.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, while the special features are the same as the DVD release, this film is primarily for the fans who want to watch this film in HD and enjoy the better transfer of this film and hear the music in lossless.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" is a film that I will forever remember as possibly Madonna's greatest performance in a film.  She embodied and gracefully portrayed the role of Eva Peron with success and because of her involvement, I enjoyed this musical much more.  The cinematography for this film by Darius Khondji is absolutely beautiful and Alan Parker did a great job directing this film, it's just the casting that I felt was off.  But still, I did enjoy this film a lot.<br /><br />\\"Evita\\" is a fine musical that really showcases the life of Eva Peron in a positive way and it helps to have a film, especially a talent such as Madonna playing the role and doing a great job in her performance.  And while I may not feel the same way about the vocal performance by Banderas and by Pryce (although I enjoyed Pryce a lot more than Banderas), both did a great job with their character role as well.<br /><br />\\"Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" may not be the greatest musical on film, but it is a memorable film with beautiful music, beautiful cinematography and a wonderful performance by Madonna.  Recommended.sic of Andrew Lloyd Webber sounds incredible in HD.  While primarily a dialogue and music-driven film through the front channels, I didn't notice the surround channels being used as much but towards the end of the film, I did notice a bit of LFE.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  The Making of Evita - (42:13)  A documentary featuring behind-the-scenes making of the film, interviews with the cast, director and knowings the challenges that existed in bringing this musical to the big screen but also the challenges that Madonna and talents had to face as well.  As well as the importance of location, look and costume design.  Very informative feature.<br />  Music Video - (3:16) Featuring Madonna's \\"You Must Love Me\\".<br />  Teaser Trailer - (1:54) A teaser trailer for \\"Evita\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Whenever I hear the song \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\", I think of Madonna singing this song on the balcony, as her character of Eva Peron, knowing that her final days are coming and just wanting to say one last goodbye to the people who have supported her.<br /><br />\\"Evita\\" is a musical that I enjoyed for its ambition and cinematography.  To shoot in Argentina, to include so many extras to make the political rallying and the funeral of Evita seem real, this was accomplished remarkably well in the film.<br /><br />Madonna does a fantastic job in playing the main character role of Evita.  From the look and the emotion, Madonna was able to bring sexiness but also an emotional demeanor to her character with efficacy.  And of course, hearing her sing, I absolutely enjoyed her songs.<br /><br />But not everyone's songs.<br /><br />Antonio Banderas was fine as the narrator, Che, who in the movie, was close to the Peron's, and as much as I enjoyed Antonio Banderas in \\"Desperado\\" (and \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\\")and the \\"Zorro\\" films, he is more of an action star in my book.  Not as a singer.  And as much as Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice really tried to bring out the machismo of Banderas through music, I wasn't so much of a fan of Banderas' singing vocals for the film then and the same now.<br /><br />And while Jonathan Pryce is a fine actor, I just didn't feel the chemistry was right between Pryce and Madonna.  So perhaps, the casting never set well with me to begin with.  And watching this film again in 2012, I still feel the same way.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, while the special features are the same as the DVD release, this film is primarily for the fans who want to watch this film in HD and enjoy the better transfer of this film and hear the music in lossless.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" is a film that I will forever remember as possibly Madonna's greatest performance in a film.  She embodied and gracefully portrayed the role of Eva Peron with success and because of her involvement, I enjoyed this musical much more.  The cinematography for this film by Darius Khondji is absolutely beautiful and Alan Parker did a great job directing this film, it's just the casting that I felt was off.  But still, I did enjoy this film a lot.<br /><br />\\"Evita\\" is a fine musical that really showcases the life of Eva Peron in a positive way and it helps to have a film, especially a talent such as Madonna playing the role and doing a great job in her performance.  And while I may not feel the same way about the vocal performance by Banderas and by Pryce (although I enjoyed Pryce a lot more than Banderas), both did a great job with their character role as well.<br /><br />\\"Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" may not be the greatest musical on film, but it is a memorable film with beautiful music, beautiful cinematography and a wonderful performance by Madonna.  Recommended.
B009RH9FR6|1.0|This is a very nice leather case that uses quality materials.  However, I do not feel it is a valuable product for use with the Kindle Fire.  The problem I have with this case is that it is bulky and does not provide good control when using the hand strap.  First, the bulky part:<br /><br />This case is twice the thickness of other cases and weighs almost as much as the Kindle does.  When you go to close the unit, the leather hand strap presses upon the glass of the kindle.  You must bend the cover slightly to get it to close and then depend upon the strap to keep it closed.  I am not sure if this will cause issues with the display, but it is worth noting.<br /><br />Second, Loss of Control with the hand strap:<br /><br />In order to use the hand strap, you MUST keep the strap at the bottom when you insert your (either left or right hand) hand so that you can use your thumb to keep the unit from flipping open!!!  The pivot point that allows the unit to perch for viewing has no restraint when using the hand strap.  Thus, if you move your thumb off of the Kindle, it will probably flip away from you!  This is not only annoying, it also is a potential issue as it opens with enough force that the Kindle could come loose and decide to take a journey to the ground.  Not only that, you look like a real dork when it happens.<br /><br />I give the company credit for innovation and quality of materials, but do not feel this is ready for the consumer until they address these two major issues. I would NOT recommend this product at this time.
B003BD236C|5.0|I Love old BW movies and this is a good one.  The acting is top notch.<br />Larry Hagman is in this movie.. RIP Sir.
0385536828|2.0|I read - a lot!  I am struggling to finish this one - and I hate quitting on any book.  The writer goes on and on when I just want him to get on with the plot.  Really not my \\"cup of tea\\".  My only hope is that it will have a great finish and I will be able to say I was wrong and it was worth the time.  (added after initial thoughts)I have finally finished this book.  The most enjoyable part of the book was the very last few pages.  It still did not make it worth the time it took to read it; but it was easier and more enjoyable than any of the rest of the book.
B007JNR4WI|3.0|Back in 1996, filmmaker Jon Turteltaub would go on to work on his latest film \\"Phenomenon\\" after coming off two successful films, \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" (1995) and \\"Cool Runnings\\" (1993).<br /><br />With a story written by Gerald Di Pego (\\"Message in a Bottle\\", \\"Instinct\\"), the film would star John Travolta (\\"Get Shorty\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", \\"Grease\\"), Kyra Sedgwick (\\"The Closer\\", \\"Gamer\\"), Forest Whitaker (\\"Platoon\\", \\"The Last King of Scotland\\", \\"Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai\\") and Robert Duvall (\\"The Godfather\\" films, \\"Apocalypse Now\\", \\"Deep Impact\\").<br /><br />The film was a success in the box office.  Budgeted at $32 million, \\"Phenomenon\\" would earn over $152 million in the box office.  And having been released on VHS and DVD in the past, \\"Phenomenon\\" will now be released on Blu-ray courtesy of Touchstone Entertainment.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Phenomenon\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Video quality is very good and features an all-new digital restoration.  There are detail and more clarity when closeups of the characters are seen, from the stubble on John Travolta to clothing.  Vibrant colors are much more evident than the previous DVD release which looked softer, so this Blu-ray release is an upgrade over the original DVD.  Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacts, banding or any video problems during my viewing of the film.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Phenomenon\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The soundtrack is primarily dialogue with the occasional music that can be heard through the surround channels.  But the most where you do hear surround channels being utilized is for ambiance during crowd scenes or when George is being struck by the light.  But for a film such as \\"Phenomenon\\", lossless audio is appropriate, dialogue is crystal clear as with the music for the film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Phenomenon\\" comes with the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />One day you are a normal man.  The next day, you realize you have special abilities.<br /><br />\\"Phenomenon\\" was a film that rather intriguing when it first came out.  A sci-fi film that captivated viewers for its take on one man's special ability and enhanced intelligence due to being struck by light.  Is it a supernatural phenomenon or something health related?  And despite using his abilities for good, it starts to make friends and residents of the town scared of him.<br /><br />This is the premise of \\"Phenomenon\\".  And while there have been a few films that have similar storylines, one thing that people have felt about \\"Phenomenon\\" is its correlation to Travolta's dedication to the Church of Scientology (which he would followup several years later in the film \\"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000″).<br /><br />But the correlation is the belief that all people have special abilities but must go through steps or changes in one's life in wanting to achieve clarity, free of the past and knowing that you are part of something much bigger than humanity.<br /><br />The religious correlation was discussed a lot back in the mid-'90s but in the case of this film, it's a film that tries to stay safe without being polemic.  The character of George Malley is a good guy who wants his abilities to help people, but because people are not sure how to react to his new abilities, many wonder if he is an extra-terrestrial, faking his abilities or what.  There is no explanation.  And so the film tries to play things quite safe with George being worried about how others think about him.<br /><br />Sure, we get the U.S. government storyline included (and I can't mention any more than that without spoiling the storyline) but if anything, the film tries to focus on the positive.  May it be his relationship to his friends, the people in the village to the one woman that George has liked.  The film doesn't stray away from the good nature of its character, so for those hoping for something drastic or even integration of action sequences, this is not that type of film.<br /><br />It's a straightforward sci-fi film with an interesting concept of what is causing George's abilities, but other than that, writer Gerald Di Pego plays it safe with the screenplay.  And to the benefit of \\"Phenomenon\\", it's a film that has a stellar cast and a filmmaker who just came off directing the successful romantic comedy, \\"While You Were Sleeping\\".  But the film was too simple for me and I felt it could have been much better.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release does look very good on Blu-ray thanks to its new digital restoration and the lossless soundtrack sounds very good as well.  But unfortunately, aside from the theatrical trailer, there are no special features included.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Phenomenon\\" could have been a different film.  I suppose focusing on George's supernatural abilities would make this almost to a superhero film and this is not what the film is all about.  For those wanting a simple storyline without the complexities of other sci-fi films, \\"Phenomenon\\" may be for you!  Cool movie, but an average Blu-ray release.tionship to his friends, the people in the village to the one woman that George has liked.

0545123283|3.0|I enjoyed this book. The pacing is quite good, keeping you interested all along through the end. There is tension between new man/wolf Cole and Isabel, and between Cole and Sam. In fact tension seems to be a running theme. Grace and her parents share a good deal of tension, as well as Isabel and hers.<br /><br />Grace runs a fever throughout the book and we're kept wondering what it might mean. Is this more than just a flu? Sam's position in Grace's life is kept in question - and not just because of the tension existing between Grace and her parents and now Sam.<br /><br />I like that Isabel is developing as more of a whole person, we see a more tender side of her.<br /><br />The ending is feverishly paced (fitting for this book!) as time ticks down on Grace's fate, we watch helplessly as the three friends who care about her most put themselves at risk to help her. Will they beat the clock?
B000MAOLVW|1.0|I really rate it 0 (zero). You will not let me watch it because I do not happen to be connected to a server in the US. What difference does it make whether I am connected to a server in Quito, Sidney, Bankok, or New York when I want to watch it. It may be a free addition to a purchase - but the whole idea still stinks.
B00817RLWY|5.0|This was my very first book written by Vonnegut and I am glad and happy to say it will not be the last. I just adored this book. I adored the writing, the ease with which Vonnegut expresses disillusion and dissolution. He was a master of sarcasm and left me laughing out loud at the sketches and commentary.<br /><br />To leave me wondering from one page to the next, refusing to put the book down was a thrill. I wanted to know what would happen to this Trout and his eccentricities, wondering what would happen to Dwayne Hoover and his son who is mentioned in passing. Hoover's world becomes what we sometimes believe in ourselves at one point or another and makes us ask: what is wrong with everyone?<br /><br />A wonderful romp into the mind of a progressive author who wrote to make a point but insisted on having fun while doing it so well and so eloquently.<br /><br />I just love it! He will be missed.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I'm an adult. This is very much a youth novel but worth the read. The writing is excellent and thought provoking. Makes me appreciative of the freedoms and life experiences we take for granted. I gave it to my children to read. It was nice discussing the book with them.
1574214276|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK HAD TONS OF TIPS AND ALSO NEW TANGLES! I OWN ALMOST ALL OF THE ZENTANGLE BOOKS AND LOVE THIS ONE ITS MY SECOND FAVORITE!! ORDER IT ITS WORTH THE MONEY!!! I AM CURRENTLY CREATING MY CHRISTMAS CARDS WITH ZENTANGLE BORDERS... AND ANY &#34;TANGLE&#34; CAN BE MADE INTO A BORDER!!!
B007SGM084|3.0|The story is OK.  Would have liked to see less repetition of dialogue.  JUst an OK read.  It occupied my time while living without power for a week.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|The odd bit of titilation was novel but several times I found myself thinking &#34; oh get a grip&#34; but not in a masochistic way.  I enjoyed  E L James' exploration of her characters but not when it came to the form of sex between them.  The style of writing for the fantasies was quite ordinary to rather banal.  I found the concept of inflicting pain on another person as part of the sexua act to be disturbing and by the end of the book I knew I would not read the following two.  I would be interested to read further work from Ms James but please, keep the sex alluring .
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the fact that there were fun surprises at every turn. Sometimes I felt as surprised as Katniss! Great writing.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|this game is boring you should not buy it it is not worth the money the kindle cuts off things
B004YD1KTO|4.0|I bought this book after reading another book (Sister) by this author.  I don't give 5 stars because I believe there is always room for improvement but if you could give half a star then would have rated it 4.5.  This is a unique scenario but the author handles it with such skill you are drawn in and totally believe.  It is one of those books I have no doubt I will return to and reread at some stage.  I absolutely loved it and would strongly recommend this book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this book in a day and found it to give a hopeful<br />view of life after death to anyone with a serious illness<br />involving themselves, or family and friends.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book. Hated the ending. I understand what she was getting at. I think she could have developed the idea a bit more. It felt like the author ran out of patience in the end and rushed to finish the book. It was a lost opportunity to expand on the idea that life is full of choices and to help the reader understand why they choose to stay together. I understand that there wouldn't be justice the way we know it, but at least make their choice to stay together palatable.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Finally the true history and not the candy coated version we learned in school. Opens up your eyes and mind to really what goes on.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I enjoy Crouch's books and have yet to read a bad one.  While this isn't his best and drags in places the storyline hooks you and you end up not being able to put it down.  Recommend the book, highly recommend the author.
B000RZOR2U|1.0|Not sure why this recording is so popular. The performances are generally bad and the audio is very poor.<br />In need of remastering but it will not make up for the sloppy performances.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|...but because it is part of the hunger games trilogy I read it anyway. The war part of it was a bit detailed and dragged somewhat, but overall I'm happy with the trilogy.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This is a funny, fast paced, and completely entertaining series! I just love it. I would recommend that anyone watch this.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I loved this book.  Funny, witty and enjoyable.  Quirky and lovable heroine, interesting characters, laugh out loud moments.  Highly recommend.
B004HETR2W|5.0|This remaster will blow your mind! This album sounds even better than the first time you heard it! What an amazing remastering process. It's not surround sound but it's not lacking either.
B002NQ08II|5.0|Aspire to be who you are not what others want you to be especially for those that love to dance.
B007BLEKPM|5.0|My whole family watched this movie and loved it. We would highly recommend this for the family. Our daughter is 15 and son is 10.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Waste of a buck. Ridiculous juvenile plot, lousy acting (especially Snow White). Although the wicked queen was pretty good. Mediocre special effects. Not worth a lengthy review, there are plenty here to choose from. Save your $$$ and spend it on \\"Lawless\\".
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this all the time. Waiting in the an office? Waiting to pick up the kids from school, football, or dance class. This is what I do while I wait. It's fun and addictive. Easy to play. Yes they do have 1 comercial at the begining of each hand, but what do you want? It's FREE. And you have the option of skipping it. I highly recommend this app for all those like me who have to sit and wait.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|They call this an app? Well it gave my kindle a virus! This is not an app it is a virus.PLEASE DO NOT BUY!
B007BLUD30|5.0|My whole family watched this movie and loved it. We would highly recommend this for the family. Our daughter is 15 and son is 10.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Even though I did not do this workout the full 30 days.. I was able to feel a difference in my body within the first week. I stayed on level one for the two weeks that I did it. I was able to keep up, and the workout got easier each day. It is a challenge at first. You will feel it in your muscles after the first time. I would definetly recommend this DVD. Quick and challenging. Just have to stick to it.
0143038583|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much I bought it for a gift this time. Informative and  increasingly funny as the book progressed.
B008NABUU8|5.0|I am horrible at this but still keep trying.  It's definately not really for me but I tried.  It played well on my Samsung Galaxy Tablet.<br /><br />I gave a full 5 stars to make up for the morons that failed to read the description that says it's not been formated for Kindle Fires and yet most of the negative reviews are from those users.  Don't blame an app for your inability to read.  I read everything before I download it because you just never know.<br /><br />Also, I found no intrusive, permissions that weren't needed.  Again, people just running their mouths about something they have no understanding of.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|My whole family watched this movie and loved it. We would highly recommend this for the family. Our daughter is 15 and son is 10.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I am not the guy that love romantic films, but this one is one of the best, very touching. Rowan Atkinson characterizes God, brilliantly. Don't miss deleted scenes.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I love Dexter! I never have bought a TV series before but after seeing the first few episodes, I was hooked!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Another game that caught my attention for way too long.  It gets more difficult as you progress but the screen is interactive enough to help guide you into figuring it out.<br /><br />The permission are all described as to what each one is used for.  Don't listen to the paranoid freaks out there.  They are uneducated and ignorant as to why we need such permissions even if it's written out for them.  They don't want to admit that they're wrong.  Yes, some of these permissions can be abused if they were in the wrong hands so that's why you have to be careful about what you install.  The FAOTDs should be pretty safe since Amazon does have to do a run through on them.  Amazon wouldn't risk losing everything because of an app.  Use COMMON SENSE!
B007JUWTI0|5.0|My whole family watched this movie and loved it. We would highly recommend this for the family. Our daughter is 15 and son is 10.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is definitely by far the best of Taylor's CDs.  The quality and content of the songs exhibits the maturing of one of music's all time greatest.
B0089IGUP4|2.0|Not their best album. Has two good songs and that is all. Every song sounds the same. Disappointment. sad face.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|I downloaded this when it was the FAOTD and found myself not going to sleep when I was suppose to.  I found myself exhausted at work!  It captured me immediately and I wanted to see what was next.<br /><br />The downside is a major downside but definately doesn't take away from the game play that's why I didn't allow it to take away a lot of stars.  There are no graphics when there could've been great potential for some artistic features in this game.  It's just dots of pigment!
B007PYEY9M|5.0|My whole family watched this movie and loved it. We would highly recommend this for the family. Our daughter is 15 and son is 10.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This story caught me by surprise with its simplicity and beauty, but at the same time with its deep insights into lives we all lead, failings we all have.  Reminded me of the Canterbury Tales format, with a modern twist of course.  I recommend it especially to a mature, or even &#34;old&#34; reader, because it speaks so well about our internalized hurts and emotional strengths growing out of them.  Overall, a pleasant read, amusing too, and often hard to put down.
B000T433CO|5.0|Charming and warm, yet funny romantic comedy. A reminder that we can take life way too serious and miss out on things right in front of us.. Love Kate, Jack, Cameron, and Jude and their characters!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I am so greatful to see this working again!  It's so easy to use and has less happening in the background than youtube so you can hit your menu button to search whatever then long hold on top of what you chose and a box pops up.  Also you can save anything to your device in different formats.  It's everything that's on YouTube just no comments and you can save!
B0085Z3B2Q|1.0|Typically very good animation and effects for a kids movie, definitley pleased with that part. But as the movie drew on, it was clear that there wasa strong environmental and political focus to the plot. In a nutshell, it basically branded the entrepreneur spirit as moronic and evil. Anyone who ever started a small business will find this movie disturbing. A great adult version of this movie would be Atlas Shrugged. We watched the Lorax once and tossed it in the trash.
B001CTDH76|2.0|I assumed that the pilot would be the show where Baker started out as Jane.  That doesn't seem to be the case.  I am not able to get the videos to work on my computer.  Maybe when I use the dvd player it will work better.  I love the show and wanted to see more episodes. So far I haven't.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|There is a lot of advertising built into the game, which can be stoppex by &quot;subscribing&quot; for a monthly fee.  I find that concept not only ludicrous but highly insulting.  It essentially keans they think the game is good enouh to be on par with a pay-to-play MMO like World of Warcraft or Guild Wars.  This is a mobile app for godsake.  Yiu can get &quot;GLU Credits&quot; by completing certain tasks but most of these tasks require alot of hoop jumping and/or downloading less than entrtaining games.  Also the game itself is rather sizable (an issue for Kindle Fire users who have only an allocated amount if storage fir apps) something like 230 MB.
B0087HT36U|1.0|but couldn't play it!  I was able to start playing on my Samsung Galaxy Tablet but as I progressed it started playing slower and slower until it eventually froze up and I had to restart my tablet.  It was cute and enjoyable up until that point.<br /><br />I believe that it's a MiniClip problem because I have had this same type of problem with another game of theirs.  As I progressed through the game it was slower and slower.  The memory they use is outrageous for such a simple game but it loses all it's fun when you can't keep playing.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Nice renditions of old tunes. Not spectacular: I'd hoped for better, but McCartney and the band do a nice enough job, and I'm glad to have this record.
1451638450|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down.  I wanted to see what the next twist or joke was.  Ivan Vorpatril tries to keep his life simple and fun.  He and his friend By are supposedly unambitious bachelors who really are doing good work at jobs that on the surface seem to be nothing much.  Their life outside their jobs gets complicated.<br /> There is much going on under the surface that is revealed casually but very cleverly as the story unfolds.  The characters are well developed through their words, actions and descriptions.  The plot is a very entertaining twist of slapstick, wrong turns, righting of wrongs and making things come out right that keep you reading to a conclusion that ties everything together but still leaves you ready for more.<br /> This book was funny, different and a very good read.  If you are a fan of the Vors, it gives a lot of back history, nicely tied in with the story so it does not stop the action.<br /> I think a new reader of the series could enjoy this book without reading the earlier books.  That's how well the author has written this book.  It is satisfying as  a stand alone story  and as an expansion of the Vor universe.
1250006341|5.0|Actually, this is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who loves all things Downton!  I know she will love it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I liked this game. I would recommend it to all. although I was a bit annoyed with how much some of the monster things take to kill
B006OCM0G0|5.0|add karen0301  i love this game its the best to pass the time its so fun my daughter likes to play it
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This is a tough one. I don't know if I've ever seen anyone go to these lengths and spend this much money on a movie with this content.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. A Sarah Palin (albeit with a Southern accent) type President of the United States is up for reelection. She sends a manned shuttle to the moon which is supposed to be a big p.r. boost being that one of the astronauts is black. When they get to the dark side they find that some WWII Nazis have a secret base and are ready to launch an attack on earth and conquer the entire planet. The black guy is captured, turned into a white guy via an albino drug and sent back with the new Nazi commander to spearhead the assault. Plots and mayhem ensue as the whole thing plays out.<br /><br />Yes this is a \\"B\\" movie but it has \\"A\\" sensibilities in all departments. The film makers didn't cheap out anywhere. The script is way better than it had to be. It sported some nice turns and didn't telegraph where it was going. The production design, costumes, special effects and music were all nearly as good as big studio releases. The acting, though not Academy Award grade, was much better than it would have been had this been made in the 80s. Udo Kier was on hand but I didn't recognize anyone else.<br /><br />This is riotous fun but it plumbs some deeper depths and landed some solid jabs at things that bordered on uncomfortable. There were huge pokes at North Korea, America's relations with the rest of the world, the selling of a President and much more. That one of the assault space ships is named the George W. Bush has to be making some people squirm in their seats. And the ending must be seen to be believed. Not the sweet, upbeat ending one might imagine.<br /><br />Again I have to wonder why the film makers went to such great lengths to put this together, but my hat's off to them. They did a sweet job and made this the best \\"B+\\" or \\"A-\\" movie ever. It almost reads like a vest pocket version of \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\" This needs tobe seen by a wide audience. It's better than it had to be and I hope I see these folks handle a lot more projects.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Intense. I've always been a walking dead fan, and while the series strays from the books slightly, it's still the best show on T.V as far as I'm concerned.
B001KZG99A|5.0|It had an interesting story interspersed with approparite comedy. I would not mind watching it again ( which is unusual for me).
B008CX2A2I|5.0|Works terrific.  I had to update the firmware on my ONYKO TX-NR414 first (because I bought it when it first came out early 2012 and there have been 3 or so firmware upgrades since - one of them to recognize the UBT-1 device.)  (Follow the update firmware procedure in the on-line user manual for the TX-NR414.  Make sure you copy all files/folders from the ZIP file onto an empty USB stick (do not copy the zip file). When update says 'completed' - use the power off button on the receiver, and make sure you had all the files on the memory stick.  Update took < 10 minutes.)<br /><br />You'll know it's working when you pair because TX-NR414 window will recognizee the UBT-1 and display \\"UBT-1\\" in window.<br /><br />I'm able to play music files, Pandora, radio stations, that are on my iphone-4.  Played for an hour and never lost connection.  Sounds great.<br /><br />I don't have the TX-NR414 on my home network.<br /><br />I have an iphone-5 that I haven't tried, and have the ipone-4 set up to just use wirelessly (since the data contract was moved from the 4 to the 5).  So - I'm using the iphone-4 as though its an ipod.  And using the iphone-4 costs me nothing with carrier since I just use it wirelessly and without phone - no 3/4G network connection needed!)
B009S8PEHY|4.0|thumbs up...I'm 64 and remember the old days when he rocked...we all slow down a little bit, easy listening for the season
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Train didn't disappoint on this new album.  Love the songs &#34;DriveBy&#34; and &#34;Bruises&#34;.  The album is terrific to listen to.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Not usually one to read harlequin novel types of books.  But I did like it....easy read.  But not really deep....of course.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it's fun but you need to be patient with it otherwise you'll be tempted to spend a lot of real money on it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really loved this book. it definitely is original. I can not wait to read the next in the series
0307742997|5.0|This book was so exciting it was a total escape into a Norwegian criminal hunt.  I highly recommend this book.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good follow-up to the first book.  I thought it was a good read....not too deep of course. Easy read for me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good &amp; cool games but the dart game and many others like it get stuck n waste time.<br />i like
B009DJB9HC|4.0|I suspect this will be BCC's last effort in the studio, at least. With the demand's on Bonamassa's time another BCC tour would be highly unlikely. I have been fortunate to see Joe's solo show, Bonham's Led Zep Experience, as well as the BCC boys themselves a couple year's ago. Outstanding were they all.<br /><br />This album obviously is Hughes's baby. The songs are all good, with the emphasis on Glenn's singing and his voice wears a little thin at times. I would have liked to hear Bonamassa's voice more. Unlike BCC2 he's relegated to background vocals here. Keyboards are a little more prominent and Bonham is Bonham. Thankfully Kevin Shirley is the ultimate producer. His 3 BCC efforts highlight Jason's playing perfectly.<br /><br />There are more Deep Purple influences here with Sherinian's playing. The intro to \\"Midnight Sun\\" is  reminiscent of The Who and whether or not they knew they were copying RUSH's \\"Tom Sawyer\\" riff in \\"Common Man\\", almost note for note, is debatable.<br /><br />I've listened to it several times now and pick up something new and interesting each time. That's a good sign I'll continue to keep playing it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have a ton of computer books in pdf format.<br />I have a Samsung Galaxy Note phone that I got because of its big screen (5 inches).<br />This allows me to read my pdf books on the phone without any problems.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|By the 3rd book it was getting to be enough about this couple, but it did tend to tie it all together into a bit of normalcy as far as a couple.  I'm not sure I would have wanted to read a 4th book.
0425263916|1.0|This book moved too slow for me. All the action was at the end of the book. Will definitely wait and get the next chapter of the book from the library for free.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham is a favorite author of mine who never disappoints me.  He can write about serious subjects but he puts a fun spin on the telling of the story.  In &#34;The Litagators&#34;, his characters are very real in very real situations.  I always learn something about life or the law that I've never known when I read a Grisham novel.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have this on my phone and tablets.<br />I have alarms for everything including getting up in the morning.<br />What is really nice is that on my phone when I am traveling it resets to the local time so I dont have to mess with changing it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I liked the beginning part of the book better than the later part.  In the later part of the book it was a bit of techno stuff.
144235545X|5.0|I really have nothing new to add to previous reviews but I wanted to help those in doubt make a decision with a good rating.<br /><br />I have just one request of Vince Flynn...can we have a break from all of these Arab, etc. bad guys? I can't keep their names straight..who is good/bad! I am sure we have some homegrown terrorists...lol!<br /><br />My personal opinion only...Vince Flynn at his worst is better than most authors at their best. I think our expectations are becoming so high that no one will be able to sustain that level forever.
B00536OCZA|5.0|I could be 20 again - which is a long time ago.<br />Just a fantastic album and came quite swiftly, given it is going around the world.<br />A++++
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|A fun movie but a little predictable. Ok for a family movie night.  I could recommend it for a younger crowd.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I loved this season of Dexter the most.  Lithgow was marvelous and the writers really outdid themselves.  A must see!
B005PK553C|5.0|Great show to watch, kept me highly entertained. Did get a little out there for a couple episodes, but I didn't lose interest.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I had pretty much given up on Rush ever since their Grace Under Pressure album. Though there were a few songs I considered decent (Big Money and One Little Victory for example) the rest all seemed like filler music to me. But then Snakes & Arrows came out and I said to myself with much reserved, \\"hey, maybe they have found inspiration again\\". It was a pretty good album IMO. But with the arrival of Clockwork Angels I'm fully convinced that this band is serious about putting out the great music we all know these guys create. Snakes & Arrows was no fluke!<br /><br />Warning: This work is not for folks who need light Sunday listening music, Nickelback\Foo Fighters generic rock or bubblegum pop. It's like sitting down to a steak dinner and a heavy dark porter. When you're done listening you'll know you've had one hell of a feast.<br /><br />I give this album a 4 out of 5 only because nobody believes 5 out of 5 reviews even though this is a 5 out of 5 album.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|It was free. you will not be disappointed. relaxing and or comforting. Better with headphones for sleep. Good for background sounds while reading or napping.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good family movie for adults and children. was not as good as tangled but still a good movie. I would recommend it
B00355L2TU|5.0|This video will whip you into shape quick. Just don't be lazy! Do it every day to get the best results! It only takes 25 minutes and your done!
B000VLE3GA|4.0|Great performance of iconic music. Some points of weakness but that didn't diminish the magic of this event. Glad they captured it. Will listen to this many times in years to come.
B004T4KQJS|3.0|Good solid and interesting info but gets quite detailed and difficult for a layman to follow. Even<br />one like me who studies this topic as a hobby. Sometimes thought it was written for scientists.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I like Facebook. I spend a lot of time laughing with friends and family on it. But the Kindle version sucks because the ads take up 99 percent of the page.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|The film as adapted from a play and, the play could not measure up. Stewart's acting is top notch. The action in the film is slow but the supporting theme screams out to the viewer. I believe this movie is a roshak test for any viewer as to the meaning of &#34;Harvey&#34; the rabbit. I watched the film and I thought it was a witness to closeness and unseen nature of the Deity but that's just me. &#34;If God isn't real all of us believer are madder than Jimmy Stewart in Harvey,&#34; Dr. Peter Kreeft said. The romantic story of the Doctor and Nurse is sweet and w/o resolution. By far classic films always leaving me wanting more and this film is no exception. It's zany but not over the top. Stewart's character appears mixed up and lost throughout the movie but who is really lost the cold clinical cynic or the true believer in Harvey the rabbit? &#34;<br />  So what is crazier the nuts in the nut house or the system in which we keep them?  If you are looking for sweetness and love watch the film. Favorite line: I've wrestled with reality for 35 years doctor and, I've finally won out over it--Elwood Dowd
B005SS2QXS|4.0|Purchased this for my husband who works outside in all kinds of weather conditions. Great protection for phone.  The belt clip could be more sturdy. We would order another if needed, but so far has been great. It fits the iPhone 4 perfect.
1451695195|5.0|Very well written and I  am very curious  about NDE<br />I enjoyed this book because it was written by a medical professional
B006YC74E8|5.0|I love this thing! I've played with, edited, and added text to more photos with this app than I have with all of the software on my computer.
B0035W8QUQ|5.0|I heard this group on youtube while searching for versions of a certain old song. They are amazing and highly talented.
B007P06DJK|3.0|Fortunately, I did not pay for this CD/DVD combo having won it, instead, in a local NPR station contest. Had I paid for it, I would have returned it in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Unless you want the very uninteresting bonus tracks or are desperate for the included DVD, just buy a copy of the better-mastered original CD (if you already own it, stick with it). The sound on this CD is so compressed (to make it louder) that the wonderful dynamic range of the original has been blown to s--t! Very disappointing. If I were Paul Simon, I'd be outraged by Sony's poor treatment of such a seminal and world-influencing (at the time) album as this.
0739302752|2.0|Sorry, this audio puts me to sleep, I have never tried audio books and most likely wont again BUY A BOOK
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I really like this app. I'm a fan of a lot of different types of music, and this app tunes right in.
B009NOVCTM|3.0|Why cut the length of some of the songs? Is there something wrong with Emotional Rescue that it was cut short on BOTH 40 Licks and GRRR!? At least give us full versions considering this is about the 10th greatest hits collection. BOO to Mick and the boys.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This story is very well written.  The imagination of the author and the twists are really very clever and keep you very interested, but I hated the ending.  Without giving it away, it was just not at all what I expected.  Stories have many ways they could end, and this would not have been the ending I would have picked, but it definitely was thought provoking.  I like uplifting books, and this was definitely not that.
0307960471|5.0|It is no secret that I am quite a huge fan of Jo Nesbø's writing and Phantom is excellent!  While reading the previous books in the series will provide the reader with a much further insight in Harry Hole, Phantom can indeed be read alone, however it is my guess that one the reader is introduced to the world of Harry Hole and the works of Jo Nesbø, the reader will want to continue reading back through the series.  For those familiar with this series, Phantom is the darkest of the Harry Hole series to date.  I highly recommend Phantom by Jo Nesbø.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|The first in a trilogy is always the best, but this is a really cute movie and I honestly think they should make more MIB movies.
B007SGM084|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy. It kept my interest and I would have given it a 5 star but the last book only went so far as explaining the first two books and then doing the happily ever after in the end. I would have liked more of the action or should I say engrossing sex that the first two had by showing how they live this lifestyle with a growing family or not. Overall this book was not vulgar or pornish which I was led to believe from some reviews. It did however open my eyes to the world of sado-masichism. Good or bad? You decide!
B009FZFONO|5.0|You can't go wrong and you are always left waiting for the next week, too bad next episode is the mid-season finally...
B00005JKHP|4.0|I have been a trekkie since before the word was coined. This completes my collection of the movies. It makes<br />a good compliment to my series collection
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|works just the way I need it to nothing more or less.  easy to use and does what I need it to
0307474275|5.0|Fast paced, history/ or more accurately, Her Story, as a mystery! If you're not familiar with the subject matter, don't read too fast, although that isn't easy! A second read won't hurt, there's a lot to explore, once the dramatic resolution of the characters is discovered.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was very hesitant to read this series because of all the hype it got when the movie came out, but now I'm glad I gave it a shot! These books are inventive and interesting! Definitely recommended!!
0062103377|5.0|I read this book in one sitting because I literally could not bear to put it down. Well written, witty.... totally captures Bobby's voice. Now, you have to be pretty well versed in Supernatural lore and up to date on the history of the series to really appreciate the humor and many of the references. But I could see even a SPN newbie enjoying this book.<br /><br />Long story short: If you are a Supernatural fan, you definitely need this book for your SPN collection!
B0086700CM|3.0|I love this app on my phone but not so much on the tablet. Fun game but on the tablet its hard to see blown up.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|You can shop right from your phone! This app is excellent, I get to check prices on amazon while at other stores to compare whether I can get it for cheaper on amazon. I did it just last night and saved $3 on the product, plus no sales tax and free super saver shipping! I love amazon!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am a great fan of John Grisham. As is the case with most of his books, this one was unputdownable.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I had tried to read Harry Potter years ago and could not get past page 10.  This book, while not great, held my attention because of her wonderful writing.  I hope she does more adult novel.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love playing the game but since the update I can't get into the shop to buy things.  I hope they fix it soon so I can play again with the full game
B008N1V11U|4.0|the game works great on my s3 but will not run on my note 2 hope this gets fixed quick so i can play it on a larger screen.
B00062PN6I|3.0|I think its not good as some expensive ones but comparing to price its not bad. design is not good but still
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you like a good psychological drama, you'll like this book.  It keeps you guessing for much of the book and just wait for the ending!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great storyline. The actors were chosen for their roles very well.  Even though it is about zombies it's well written and well acted.
B007HACDLK|5.0|My son introduced me to his books and I was at a book signing and had the author sign a book for my son.  Always a thriller
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book had a lot of action in it. So much that I could stay up all night reading it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham at his best. The best since The Partner. Great fiction, I couldn´t put the book (kindle) down. I normally like most of John Grisham books, but I was missing this kind of action... Very gooo.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|Violent and heartless.  No storyline that I can tell except how brutel can people be to each other. Don't buy.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|newsfeed still not working....while on facebook it said my version is outdated and faster more reliable version available so i clicked on update tookme to this app but NO UPDATES ARE AVAILABLE?  wtf?
0547884591|5.0|I have read each of Tim Ferris' books, and come away with many ideas, and often wanting more.  The 4-hour chef fits in that category.  And, before I go further, I do recommend this book, and will give it to friends as gifts.<br /><br />I often use his books as stepping points to go further.  This book will lead to the same.  Unlike the blogger who decided to create all of Julia Child's recipes in one year, Tim focuses on just 18 initial lessons, two per week, as a start to enter the world of cooking.  This is enough to become familiar with the idea of cooking, and possibly learning something new twice a week, and nearly enough to nearly create a habit in looking forward to learning more.  We'll just have to trust that he has done his homework and has chosen the best first steps for us readers.<br /><br />There are a few areas which are lacking, or, at least, I'd like more detail.  One describes how he learned to dead lift very heavy weights.  He writes that he got the instructions from one of the coaches mentioned, then reports that he accomplished his goal--however, he doesn't give the instructions.  Another, when describing his language learning, I didn't get quite enough detail to really grasp what he actually learned.  He describes learning theory (e.g. breaking up learning into smaller segments of time--very true), and shows a poster of the most frequently used Japanese words (illegible, and I haven't found one anywhere that I can read).  Granted, this is a 'cookbook' for learning, but for at least these couple of examples, there isn't enough.<br /><br />That being said, I'm not aware of anyone else who has made the effort to go as far as he has gone.  And I'm a willing participant to go along with his ride of exploration with this book.  I find it fun most of the time, frustrating some of the time, but overall worthwhile.  I look at his efforts as a way to screen many ideas for me (particularly in topics that I have not yet engaged) so that I can more efficiently be introduced to them.  Then, if the topics interest me enough, I'll go further.<br /><br />One idea that was very useful was one when Tim discussed learning to recognize spices.  Over the years I have collected aromas, often obtained from wine shops, so that I could learn to recognize and categorize different smells (and tastes, when it comes to wine).  And after a trip to the spice museum in Hamburg, Germany, I decided to learn more about tasting spices.  Tim's experience of tasting the spice, almost 'tea like', helped him recognize some of the spices.  While I have known that there are taste receptors in more places than just the tongue, I hadn't made this connection.  Simple ideas like this, which open the door to even more experiences, make exploring this book worthwhile.<br /><br />Again, I do recommend this book.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I use this with my foscam ipcams.  The program works well and I enjoy looking at traffic in places I never go.  It can handle up to 9 cameras.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has mastered  the voice of &#34;twisted,&#34; and I mean this is the best possible way. It's hard to review this book without giving too much away, but I was enthralled by the character development, and the way, with each chapter, we got a glimpse into a new layer of Amy and Nick's not-so-picture-perfect marriage. To say that I couldn't put this book down was an understatement, because even when I wasn't reading it, I was trying to unravel the mystery in my head. And when I reached the last page, just...well, wow.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is an instant classic, all the characters are portrayed well and the suspense/action/humor are all as good as expected.
B006WQLH7G|1.0|I could not figure out how to get it installed on my Kindle Fire. I thought it would be more user friendly. I gave up and removed it.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I use this APP alllllll the time.  My husband is always turning the light out at night before I go to bed and I hate walking around in the dark.  You can make it glow in infinite colors, choosing from a color wheel. There is also a choice between full screen and a small led light on the screen.  Nice APP.
1574241451|5.0|A nicely put together book about the history of the ES-335 guitar while noting some popular musicians who have used or still use it.  I like the sales figures and finishes put together for each year.  I own an ES-335 so it's fun for me to read about how and why this model came to be.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My daughter and I have read all these books and have enjoyed them thoroughly. The stories are well written and very engaging.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This is the most fun I've had in a long time and the kids love it too. Give it a try you'll have  hours of fun.<br /><br />.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is a great series and i cant wait to get into this game. Nice cover art as well. yay.
B00338QENI|1.0|Condescending and racist in the portrayal of the imediate family. I think it is arogant for an author to attempt to flavor the dialogue with an ignorant accent. The science was fine; however I feel that the family portrail could have been more sensitive in this day and age,
B00005JO9J|4.0|My daughter loves Greys Anatomy but was not allowed during the school year to stay up late to watch it. This has filled her in on the earlier seasons quite nicely!
B0042KA4VO|5.0|guilty pleasure.  So twisted and beautiful with gorgeous people.  A soap opera admittedly but fast moving with good twists.  Perfect thing to unwind after a hectic day.
B0051GY0LS|4.0|An easy little read that keeps you interested right through.  Now reading it to my 9 year old grandson, who thinks Theodore is just the 'ants pants'.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Just one sentence.It's good=).Although this is not for my own.But it's really good!The owner said it was good as well.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|on time very excellent conditions. I didn't like that in the stores they had it for a lower price and with a toy.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|What a twist  never thought this would turn out the way it did.  Makes you think about what is real
B005ZLZJGE|4.0|First one I have read of Kate Morton and I find I like her a lot.  Certainly keeps you entertained.  Story flows well with lovely definition of characters.  Almost lyrical and is able to transport one to where her tale is set.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It had very good audio and video if yo enjoy zombies you will like this season as much as I do
B000ICL3KG|5.0|very good price, everybody should have this movie. very good price and it was send on time. very good movie
1451638450|4.0|This is only an above-average Bujold book, which makes it an excellent novel. Ivan, \\"Ivan, you idiot,\\" Vorpatril becoming more than he has been is not terribly unexpected. We saw in recent books that his mother, the formidable Alice, was more than she had seemed. She had always _been_ more than she had seemed. Because of the instigation of By, who we recently saw was also more than he had seemed, and a new love interest, Ivan rises to one occasion after another and shows more intelligence and energy than most of us would have given him credit for.<br />I actually expected an even better book, I must admit, but that was probably unfair.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|when u get this app it might be fun but it takes to long to load on ur kindle fire that's the only. problem
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Rush remains unmatched by ANY other rock band out there. Just like always, the new album is loaded with awesome lyrics and powerful guitar, bass, and drums throughout!
B002RVCD6O|4.0|Nice movie that follows the Half Blood Prince book fairly well. A<br />few deviations from the book, but nothing serious.  It's a movie<br />I would recommend to any fan of the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars, but the movies  colors<br />were a bit greyish to suit me. I like brighter colors<br />myself.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought this book was freaking amazing!!!! I really love this book series and very happy he wrote these!!! Good job
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is really a challenging and fun game love this game, didn't think I would like it but it has grown on me and now  I have not been able to put it down since I started playing. LOVE THIS GAME.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As every previous Lee Child book was difficult to put down the book until finished! Can't wait for the next novel.
1615470158|5.0|My book came in yesterday's mail, and I spent a couple of hours looking through it last night. This morning I started changing the way I'm doing things in PowerPivot.<br /><br />I have the two other best-selling PowerPivot books, but this is by FAR the best! It's clearly written, and has lots of screen captures that are large enough so that you can actually read the text they contain.<br /><br />The explanations are careful and precise. The author often explains how PowerPivot is 'thinking', which is not the way you or I think. If you are an Excel person, you should know that it also is not the way Excel thinks. With DAX formulas, understanding the logic makes the difference between utter confusion and success.<br /><br />Back to write some more DAX formulas, with a smile!
B009ESIGHI|1.0|Honestly I give it a one star because the vhs version containing \\"When Love is Gone\\" will always be better.  I apologize but ball dropped Disney, ball dropped.
034580404X|5.0|My book set came sooner than I expected and they were in perfect brand new condition! This was an awesome deal and they were great books too! I am greatly satisfied!
B007EDYN36|5.0|I loved the Book. I have been dying for YEARS to hear someone other than Paul and Gene's view on the band..  Ace's was too vanilla. This book was much more honest and forward.  It's a must read for any Kiss Fan. and so far the most Candid.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|A little slow to get started. My kids love it. Ironman's humor makes the movie IMO. If you're a fan of the Ironman movies or Captain America, you'll like this one.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This was a great combination of  adventure, action, plausable aliens and excellent special effects and the humor that occasionly pops up is great.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|They don't mess around with the music they produce. They put out the music they want. true rock and roll artistry.They just don't make it this way any more. I own every album that I know of that they produced. All are top notch.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is another thriller involving the kidnapping of an American CIA operative and Rapp is his normal self.  The red tape and problems with diplomacy remain in this book.  I am beginning to find that these books are all the same basic story with some of the same characters and some new ones but the story remains the same with different window dressing.  If you have read several of this series you know what to expect and it is just what happens.  I like these stories, but they really need to make some changes somewhere or just give up and make a series like NCIS.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|Love the show, love having the season DVD's.  Very fast shipment and a great addition to the Bones collection of episodes.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Besides the fact that this movie is just awesome, the 3d effects are really impressive.  You just can't be dissappointed with this!
B001L83PLQ|3.0|I am about a third of the way through this book.  It's not that its a terrible read, but I am not hooking in to the purpose of the book.  It's probably just me.  I'm sure it will get going in the next few pages!!??
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great read by Vince Flynn.Very up to date subject matter in this book. I stayed up very late at night to finish it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works great, solves the problem of knowing when the Kindle is fully charged as well as other useful information.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I was really surprised at the sound quality because this was done in 1981. They must have really re-mastered. The DVD overall was excellent in quality and in content. I enjoyed watching the excitement of the Stones meeting the Master! The energy was captured through out the DVD. The packaging of this product is excellent and I really liked the insert with the story. I'm very satisfied with this purchase...What a bargain!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Mitch Rapp novels and found them to be thought provoking regarding the amount of military detail and middle eastern savy of our enemy.
0060254920|5.0|This is an awesome book! I think every kid has read this and felt what Max felt. Just going to a place where he meets some creatures to play while he wears his pajamas to hangout with the monsters. Growing up as a kid everyone has read this book. If you have not read the book. READ IT!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Usual excellent Flynn novel. Only negative was keeping up with all the different caracters.I always enjoy following the trials of Mitch Rapp.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I am adding to my review (see below) because I was able to contact Big Fish customer service, who were very helpful.  It seems I was entering the runes wrong -- game spoiler:  You need to assume the number above each rune is the order you enter it.  For example, if No. 5 is above the first rune, then it is the fifth rune you enter.  I still am only giving this four stars, since I found this confusing, and I know from other reviews that I'm not the only one!<br /><br />I would like to give this game a better review, since I have played several Big Fish games on my computer, and I've loved them all!  However, this one is more difficult to follow than most -- too much running back and forth.  Now my game seems to be frozen at the rocks, where it doesn't respond when I enter the runes in order according to the 'clue' and according to the walkthrough.  Maybe I am oversimplifying something, but it shouldn't be that hard, or the game should let me skip the puzzle.
1451695195|3.0|The good doctor likes to brag on himself. Too much about him and his personal ego and not enough of what the book is supposed to be about.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Excellent movie, great quality of Blu-ray.<br />Great price for quality.<br />Glad to had bought it as a gift, we´ll buy the last one.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|very predictable! The characters did not leave a lot to figure out in the plot. I liked his earlier books much better.
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|This was a disappointment as I was looking for a program to read pdfs aloud.  It worked with programs but sounds too computerish.  Needs friendlier voices.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Love Channing Tatum...and u get to c him in all his glory!!...wonder if they will make a part 2?...only time will tell
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This is a great case cover for my kindle fire.  It  fits snugly in the case, and helps to protect my device from dirt and grime.  There is also an inner pocket for storage.  Highly recommend.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|George Clooney, exquisite, sexy, and interesting.  Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah
B008AK8FHM|5.0|one of my coworkers told me to read this book, I was not able to put it down and I have told many people about it and its a must to read....
0345803485|1.0|I hated it. I loathed it. It's such garbage. Look, I have absolutely nothing against sex, BDSM, or whatever but I DO have major problems with horrible writing. I skipped through the book straight to the sex scenes just to see what the big deal was about because I figured THAT had to be worth all the hype, but NOPE! Even the parts that were supposed to be kinky were juvenile and boring. This book was such crap in every way imaginable. It hurts that this garbage is a bestseller. Congrats to the author for pulling such a major hustle! On another note, many of the customer reviews on this book are quite entertaining & worth more of a read than the actual book!!!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Michelle Williams and supporting actors were great! Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah;
B00913DPW2|5.0|Found this by accident during their promotion. What a great surprise. My grandaughter and I played it a few times. Have purchased The Haunt 2 and highly recommend both!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is kind of like golf in that it is a piece of cake one time and impossible te next!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is a very sweet and funny movie.  My daughter loved it.  The adult humor isn't lost on my 6 year old either.  She enjoys the jokes as well.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This movie was awesome loved every minute of it one of the best batman movies out today.<br />I would recommend this to any batman fan.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom has a way of drawing me into a story. And he is as smooth as ever in The Time Keeper. I really enjoyed this novel.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|You can always trust AMAZON!!!! The product arrived ahead of time.No damage.Great star wars collectors edition.a must have tht will only go up in value and fun to display.A HUGE DISPLAY!!!!!
B00005K9LK|5.0|As far as the quality of the CD itself goes it arrived in great shape and plays excellent.  I cant remember a time when I've ordered a CD new or used via Amazon and it skipped.  As far back as I can remember I've never had a problem.  This is the digitally remasterd version and it sounds great.  It also has the bonus track &#34;Prisoner of Your Eyes&#34; which is a really good song.  It's a little out of place with the tone of the rest of the album but it's still good.  I doubt I could say anything about the rest of the cd that hasn't already been said.  This was one of the heaviest albums Priest ever made and is a prime example of what Heavy Metal was all about at the time.  Great CD.
B0091LS07E|1.0|Loved every other album Alicia Keys has made. But the song \\"Girl on Fire\\" (I'm NOT feeling this song at all!!) made me think twice before purchasing this CD. \\"Brand New Me\\" is the best song on the entire CD. Even the duet with Maxwell (I LOVE Maxwell!!) is a disappointer. And \\"Girl on Fire\\" is a duet with Nicki Minaj (I DO NOT LIKE Nicki Minaj!!! And I'm REALLY NOT feeling the song now!!!) This album is her worst, very bland, boring, and rushed. A BIG disappointment!
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game.  It's a great way to pass the time while waiting at the doctor or DMV. However, it is almost impossible to get past certain levels without getting all of the upgrades.  But definitely a keeper.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Wish more were free. Hints help a lot. I love hidden object games. It is easy to follow the story line.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|I have absolutely loved this movie since I first saw it a long, long time ago - it is a timeless classic that is full of unbelievability, color, and disturbing views of the underside of a secret society that we are only comfortable watchign from a distance.  But watch it we must.<br /><br />As a lifetime Brooklyn resident, I am particularly fond of this movie as I cheer the Warriors on as they try to make it home, through the darkened gang-ridden streets of New York.<br /><br />To this day, every time I see James Remur I shriek out ... Ajax.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - see it.  If you don't own it - buy it now :)
B009A9BF5G|2.0|This is my first review for amazon since using them for years without complaint. I ordered the Coldplay Live 2012 blue ray disc for the higher picture quality but when viewing the disc i was really disappointed by the picture quality. The picture looks hazy ,not clear. I have one of the latest LG smart Tv's new on the market with a top of the line panasonic Blue Ray player which shows a fantastic picture for other Blue ray movies i have watched.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|CandySwipe is a nice, mindlessly entertaining game; however, it lacks staying power.  There is nothing about this game that can retain your attention for any significant amount of time; therefore, if you like to be descriminating about your apps, I would descriminate against CandySwipe.  If, on the other hand, you don't mind playing this while zoning out, then inevitably delete them rather than waste storage space, then go ahead, it will amuse you for a little while :)
B00A77II0U|5.0|I loved this game. The graphics are very good and it has a good story behind it. I just wish it was longer. One of the best hidden object games for the kindle!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is an awesome app. I love it!!! I use it on kindle fire and have it saved in my favorites!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have told my friends to get this app.
B007MU85D0|4.0|Great album, lake house; slow and steady; mountain sound; king and lionheart; dirty paws.<br /><br />All fantastic songs, you should just do it
B003SM1Z10|4.0|The show is pulverizing with great atmos and it's well filmed but for the fact very little camera time is spent on the fretboards; I didn't even get to see what bass guitar Tom was using, although I guess it's the same ESP he's been using for the last decade, and it's even audible in the mix at times, and that's a first !!!<br /><br />Yes it's only 62' long and the DVD authoring is quite poor; the bonus songs are indeed performed after the ¨Reign In Blood¨ lp performance when they were actually played BEFORE  and yes some 30' of the show were not included which is a bummer but the original intention was to showcase RIBlod live so I felt lucky for the inclusion of the other 6 songs.<br /><br />The pic bitrate hovers around a meagre 6 Mbps (maybe they went for a DVD 5 pressing, although I've not wheighed it) and it's plagued with both purposely B&W and grainy shots and there are 2 AC3 soundstreams, one of them 5.1 but both have King's axe ten times louder on the right channel which kindda ruined it for me. Tom's vox is OTT all over the mix (hate that) but the bottom end is SHATTERING !! When Lombardo actuates both kickdrum pedals an earthquake occurs, and I'm not one for exaggerating my sub's volume !!<br /><br />There is a cool interview with the guys which is in 4:3 aspect with a higher pic bitrate (why ?! It's a friggin' extra FFS !!) which could have been saved for the gig.<br /><br />BUT, this DVD kicks so much butt I couldn't take more than one star off what could have been a perfect 5.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game but it is very habit forming. It challenges your brain and really makes you think. I look forward to playing it a lot more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love how this game helps you think out of the box and at the same time is easy enough to play that you don't get irritated cuz you cant win. lots of fun even my 6 year old niece loves to play it.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show. Nothing much to be said other than apparently, 30 is the new 20! It's really funny and fast paced. Its definitely intended for an older audience though, not for young kids.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I thought Vince Flynn could not get any better, but I was wrong.  This book was very riveting!  Lovewd it!
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Surprisingly very good. Had an amazing cast and everyone blended together quite well! I loved everything about it and all the different story lines to all the couples expecting kids.
0143113100|4.0|This very interesting book, written in easy to understand language.  I bought it for a course and ended up reading the entire book.  I plan to keep it, too.
B009CPGZFS|5.0|Nothing much to be said other than Simon Baker is amazing. I love this show and its pretty much the most amazing show ever! Not your average crime tv show. Watch it!
B001EBYM62|5.0|a fun time for all to watch.  spans the generations.  makes you want to be a singing in the rain
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Very vivid and capturing which with to days distractions is incredibly hard to do. This was an outstanding book. Re wet my appetite for the classics. And to think I only picked it bu because it was small.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper is so endearing and we have watched it repeatedly with our older grandchildren. We had it on vhs so we def needed an updated version... and we now have another set of younger grandchilden that haven't seen it. Was happy to get it on dvd... much better quality!! If you haven't seen it yet... you're in for a treat.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I chose this rating because this dictionary is very accurate and has every single word that come out of my mouth.I like everything its wonderful.I would recommend this to all my friend and family.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I bought seasons one, two, and three of the Big Bang Theory what fun. I have laughed and laughed. If your looking something light and funny you will love these dvd's. Enjoy
B004EPYZPS|5.0|On the outset, it's exactly what you'd expect from the makers of ET and Cloverfield -- ET meets Cloverfield, the best of both worlds combined. But what really got me in this movie, which is the heart of every good movie, a moving and compelling story. You don't get down to the monster stuff until you are a good way through the film, but you'd captivated by the story of one boy, one girl and their friends, family and town. It's a wonderful character story portrayed by very talented kid actors -- the group of boys make me laugh every time I watch it. The monster stuff is fun, but the main reason I watch it is not for the scary, the thrilling, or the action aspects, it's for the heart of the story.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Simple writing.  Romance novel combined with stories from porn magazines.  Don't see what all the hype is about.  Not worth the money.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|I like all of the Potter films, and while this one isn't the best out of the lot, I really enjoyed it's more subtle approach. It has it's usual share of action, adventure and comedy -- but this installment was more subdued and worked more on the emotional interplay of the characters. The previous one was great, action, drama and angst, but this one is kind of the deep emotion breath before the final push in the series.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I loved being able to watch Raiders in beautiful High Definition. It was glorious. I was also really intrigued by the extras, and watching them film to original movie. Some of the alternate takes and the conversations between the actors and the director were extremely interesting for anyone that cares about the process of making movies, let alone a classic.<br /><br />I love Indiana Jones and only wish the Crystal Skull was a much better film. The first forty-five minutes feels like it could be a great Indy film, but the rest of it is a mess. It makes Temple of Doom look like high art. Nevertheless, I love the first three films, and having them on Blu-Ray makes me happy.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|i do not enjoy this game, the graphocs are not very good and it is not fun, sorry, but if you enjoy classic games, i guess this is for u
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was and continues to be one of my all time favorites. An amazing journey through a horrific ordeal will have you in tears of sorrow and joy. It touches at spirituality in a way to encourage you but not sway in anyone direction. Be prepared for anything to happen and to be taken on an emotional roller coaster. Life of Pi truly is a masterpiece of our time.
B009ERK1T0|4.0|Bottom line: Koi No Yokan seems like an evolution of some of the changes we saw from Diamond Eyes.<br /><br />I've been through the album from beginning to end several times now (and threw a concert in for good mix). I find that the songs of the album is its best critic. For instance, we know of the single releases (Leathers and Tempest). These are great songs for attracting an interest in the album. Once you get the album in hand, you get to hear how amazing Rosemary is (cassette recordings didn't do the song justice). Then there's that amazing track, Entombed. Wow!<br /><br />But what could quite be perfection is soiled by tracks such as Romantic dreams. I'm not saying RD is a bad song though. It's just that it doesn't measure up to the great songs on the album. Sure, this is normal. But Deftones set its own amazingness bar with White Pony and Diamond Eyes (epic sound adventures from beginning to end). Where I feel these albums are probably the best put out by the Deftones, I feel like Koi No Yokan is more on par with some of the band's other albums, meaning, I felt there were great songs and one or two \\"meh\\" songs (i.e., Adrenaline and Around the Fur).
B003NB6GQK|5.0|I decided to see if these things were worth all the hype, and I'm proud to say they are.  I went for a 10 mile run, followed by 10 trips up and down about 160 stairs at a local park with a 20 pound vest on.  Needless to say, my muscle were sore and aching after this workout, and usually I'm out of commission for a couple days after I do it.  This time I put these on and wore them for the rest of the evening and to bed.  I was amazed at how fresh I felt the next morning.  I did not have the usual soreness that makes getting out of the bed a herculean effort, nor did I feel like my legs were shot.  These are a must by for any athlete that trains hard, and wants to recover fast.<br /><br />Also they feel amazing when you have them on, and according to my girlfriend they seriously compliment your physique.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this is the best app ever! but first get the free app. it helps you learn more. the free app isn't a rip off... its exsactly like this one! it have very realistic creature's in it. and you fight creatures in dark caves like spiders and centipedes! but in the water, beware of the great white shark! you die, no problem! you just respond to where you first entered the game! but at least try to discover a cave. these caves can be found where there is a big hill. or can be found in water! at first when I entered the game, I had no idea how to controlled my character, but after I got used to the feeling, Im a pro now! NOT A WAIST OF MONEY!!!! its just like minecraft! but better!
B004UID2LC|1.0|Don't waste your time, don't waste the space on your appliance.  No wonder it is free.  Really thankful I didn't pay anything for it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books, very good story line!! Hoping there will be more books added to this trilogy, the end of the third book left it open for just that !!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Quick and easy to view and check up on my auctions when I'm away from my computer.  Very good selection arrangement.
031606792X|5.0|5 stars because my wife loved the book, she has read the first<br />three and this was her best...I have not read this book
B000SGRONM|3.0|This was my first time reading a David Sedaris book cover-to-cover.  I've read a few of his other stories and excerpts based on recommendations.  I chose this book for my book club and am not sure how the group will respond to it.  I found it cynical and disillusioned, as expected.  Unfortunately, for the most part, these tones were not accompanied by the humor I was expecting.  I will definitely try some of his other books, but overall, was let down with this particular collection.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Very cute game. I like that you can go back to it or you can keep playing. Only problem thus far is after I first installed the game, exited out and went back to play it froze my kindle fire, then re booted the fire and it still froze,  but after uninstalling and re installing the app it has worked fine. I do enjoy the game and graphics of it and it is good for the young,  as well as,  the young at heart. Try it out,  it's free.
0385535147|5.0|SPOILER ALERT - Don't read this if you haven't read the book.<br /><br />GRISHAM'S MATH IS WRONG: Pg 278 \\"A perfect rectangle not a half inch thick..stamped \\"10 ounces\\" - a mini-bar. Pg 299 \\"I'll pay $1,220 an ounce.\\" \\"'For five bars?' I ask. 'Fifty ounces?'\\" Pg 303\\"..he caresses the 5 mini-bars before dropping them into the inside pockets..\\" \\"I.. count 122 stacks of $100 bills, ten per stack.\\" \\"'A hundred and twenty-two thousand dollars.'\\"<br /><br />BUT 5 mini-bars at 10 ounces each is 50 ounces, as confirmed on Pg 299. 50 ounces times $1,220 per ounce is only $61,000. My Twitter is @locopuesto. Let me know what your math is.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Krugman writes the way he talks so that the reader can grasp the very important information he is conveying without being lost in technical jargon. A must for anyone worried about our economy.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I came across 2 Cellos when I was looking up Lindsey Stirling on YouTube.  I am intrigued by young artists who are inspired by Michael Jackson's music and choreography.  I watched their rendition of Michael's \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and was so impressed!  This is not your parent's music!!!  Well, my parents are really old, in their 70's now.  Anyway, 2 Cellos are fresh and innovative with so much talent.  So I ordered their cd, and I am not disappointed.  I am ready to preorder their next one which will be released on January 15th.  These guys rock!  Love 'em, love 'em, love 'em.  As one reviewer put it, \\"Cello on!\\"
0307346617|1.0|I still can't figure out how so many people can give this book five stars.  It's a complete mystery to me.  Everything in the book gets repeated over and over again.  About the only thing that changes are the locations.  You could take any twenty-five pages and switch them with another twenty-five pages somewhere else in the book and the \\"story\\" would still be the same.  Readers wouldn't even notice the difference because it wouldn't change the story one bit.  The author had some very good ideas but he never developed any of them.  I hope he is NOT the one who wrote the screen play for the movie version because he would ruin it.  The trailer looks great and the movie could be fantastic if the right people put it together as a story that flows from start to finish.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book! I couldn't put it down. Read it in 1 day!!  I was disappointed, however, to find that the last book in the trilogy won't be released until May 2013.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|My son and I listen to audio books while driving the long commute to school. The story must be interesting to us both. The Inheritance Cycle is a really good fantasy genre story. Good character development, good story line throughout all four books. The reader's performance must be excellent. Gerard Doyle's performance is Grammy Award material in our opinion. We discuss the events that we listen to in the car and at home. You can't do this easily with a movie or tv show.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I thought there would be some kind of directions on how to use the camera.  I don't like the fact that you can only take pictures basically of yourself, maybe I will just use it as a mirror.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|Initial impressions.  USB connection to computer and good headphones. Didn't sound as good as my computer to Fiio E10 to small Denon desktop system but may be apples to oranges and not a valid comparison. iPod to AUX connector to headphones (amplifier only) didn't sound as good as using the Fiio E11 headphone amplifier.  Did well when bypassing Blue-Ray player's DAC with SPDIF connection. Small, but noticeably better sound in headphones.  Need to do further comparisons for better evaluation.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was nothing as I suspected it to be. It had a funny twist to it and I hope that there is another book to come. (:
B009WO7NQO|3.0|you pay 2.99 for the game then only get two levelsthen you have to pay for more levels that isn't right to have to pay once for a game thinking you get the whole game yeah right rovio you screwed up this time the game is fun but to have to pay twice for it just to get extra levels is so wrong. money grabbed is what this is.  that's all I gotta say about it.
B007NU54H4|5.0|This was a wonderful film and a complement to the Tinker Bell series.  My granddaughter wanted to watch it again and again.  Definitely worth the money to see the glow on her face!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|If Word ever turned Flesh it certainly happened in &#34;Sweet Tooth.&#34; Dont read it if what you want is an exciting spy story. Certainly, the spy world is an excellent corollary for the book,  for in both, reality is always fluid and ambivalent, and twisted to fit the shape of the narrative.  The brilliant narrative is the real heroine of the book. We may know or not what London was like in the early 70's but I can't think of a better way to express it than:<br /><br />  &#34;Late October brought back the annual rite of turning back the clocks, tightening the lid of darkness over our afternoons...&#34;
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Another wonderful production.  My granddaughter was so excited, she loves Tinker Bell and this adventure kept her interest until the end.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I just wanted to watch this movie because it was about Abe Lincoln killing vampires but I din't expect much. I enjoyed it a lot. The story was decent and the action sequences were phenomenal. This movie was so cool! It's worth watching.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Like many of Sanderson's work this book has an intriguing magic system.  This is enhanced by its connection to the system in Elantris.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I will not write 20 or more words to review a product i have purchased. If amazon wants reviews they will accept the stars I click.
B005KGPC4S|4.0|I enjoyed this off-beat movie. Some people might see this movie and think that religious “nut’s” in the “Red States” might do something like this, I don’t, but it’s was fun to see how an extreme group of people would take their beliefs to the limits.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I will not write 20 or more words to review a product i have purchased. If amazon wants reviews they will accept the stars I click.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I remember this book fondly from when I was a kid. Now, as a psychotherapist, I use the book to help my clients understand that the things we fear may not be as scary or as dangerous as we think!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I will not write 20 or more words to review a product i have purchased. If amazon wants reviews they will accept the stars I click.
1848378963|3.0|I really enjoyed the premise of the book.  It is a good read until about three-quarters of the way through.  Then it becomes tedious and a little far-fetched.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I like the fact that Mitch Rapp holds true to form.  He doesn't take grief from anybody.  If you are in his way then he is going through you, period.  I also like the way Vince Flynn brought some of the previous characters back to provide insight into the minds and behaviors of the men and women who would lead this kind of life, and there by provides some closure.  My only knock on the book is that it ended to abruptly.  I would like to know how some of the guys got out of the situations they were in and what the fall out was like.  And like all Vince Flynn's books, what upsets me most is that I have to wait for the next one, and I don't want to wait.  Thank God Vince cranks the books out so the wait isn't to long.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Finished Safe Haven and am now struggling with what to read next. I enjoyed it so much, that everything else is now falling flat. Nicholas Sparks is at his best in Safe Haven. Beautiful story of life and love.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|It was a cool idea but there wasn't enough character develpoment or backstory.  It was too disconnected for me.  It would have been nice if they had made the movie longer so it could have gotten across the story in a smoother fashion.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I have been a fan of Kelly Clarkson since she won American Idol and this Greatest Hits CD doesn't disappoint. It's a great collection and representation of most of her best songs. There is a good mix of music, including older songs such as \\"A Moment Like This\\" and \\"Miss Independent\\" as well as her newer songs such as \\"Mr. Know it All\\" and \\"Stronger\\". Even though I own many of her previous CDs, I'm glad to have so many of her great songs together on one CD.<br /><br />The bottom line - I love this CD! I purchased this for myself, but it would be a great gift for any fan of Kelly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My eyes were glued to the book from start to end. i recommend this book to EVERYONE old or young. The plot is extravagantly thrillimg and the characters are relatable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great way to help pass the time.  Easy, fun and relaxing.  Looks and works great on the kindle hd
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Honestly, I don't have too many good things to say about this trilogy. I'm not taking anything away from Miss James but this was the biggest load of crap I may have ever read. Not once during my painful and horrifically annoying time reading this drivel did I become &#34;overwhelmed&#34; with desire or &#34;brought to sudden ecstasy&#34; with the erotic nature of sex-speak int the books. You get more out of Penthouse or a porno but I'm sure that wasn't her goal. Miss James may have moistened the panties of soccer mom's out there but these &#34;stories&#34; of a ludicrously rich twenty year old a sexualy inept &#34;virgin&#34; falling in love by S&M and sado-masichistic behavior just made me laugh. It's the most fake piece of work I've ever come across and trust me I'm a fantasy and science fiction nut. Just the way she wrote about these two characters Ana and Christian made me taste bile and wish the male lead Christian or fifty or Mr.Grey or whichever adolescent nickname the female lead gave him, just want to die already. I was so annoyed with the way both characters went on and on and on with their little childlike back and forth. Please! NO ONE TALKS OR ACTS LIKE THIS IN REAL LIFE. If James was going for this sort of thing I wasted my money and time reading them. I couldn't even get through the 3rd book due to the fact that I was so sick and tired of the way the 2 main characters went at it. I'm sorry for being so over the top negative but I was asked for my opinion and I gave it. I recently saw a magazine dedicated to the book and it's many sexually deprived mid-wives and wanted to scream my lungs raw. Unreal...
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I like the movie does not mean I approve the behavior of these characters.It is well written and Diaz is fantastic, expecially the car wash scene. The simulated sex scene is also very interesting.<br /><br />Even she is very bad but I found I sympathize with Diaz. Definitely she should be fired.<br /><br />Just relax and enjoy the movie.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|This is the best book he's done yet.  And I thought each of the other ones were fantastic.  It's so nice to have some of the old gang show up in this story.  The new characters are even more fleshed out and consistent in the development.  Love the story, the nod to western/cowboy genre, yet with Abercrombie's grit and humor.  I want all my reading friends to read this book so we can share all those pithy saying - I mean we have to realistic about things.  Nine rules!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I loved the movie and I love the soundtrack!  It isn't exactly the same as it was in the movie, but it is still very good!  I highly recommend it!
0547884591|5.0|I'm only a fraction in but so far the meta-learning section is great and the book is beautiful! I would definitely recommend buying the physical book and the hardcover at that because it is so large and diverse I don't think you would get the full experience with all the graphics unless you get the physical. I prefer physical books for non-fiction in general. I love Tim's other books and this one is like the icing on the cake and I feel like the meta learning is like the bonus on top of the other 2.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Ellie is amazing.  This album is even better than her first one!  I highly recommend it to everyone!  Get it.
B00448SE4S|5.0|I really like Scott Pilgrim so much I watched it twice in 2 days. I didn't find out it was a comic book series until after, so I got the box set a little while latter and what i noticed was the movie stayed fairly true to the series though they did skip a few parts but hey you can't fit everything in,as well as they portrayed the main charters and most of the side charters very well but I didn't think Michael Cera did Scott Pilgrim justice but it's a minor complaint.<br /><br />The action in the movie is done well but sometimes fights and mashed too closely together and some back stories on the bad guys aren't fleshed out, even with no knowledge of the books I had no trouble following the story. I bought the Blu-Ray ray version and the main menu screen is a little hard to navigate mainly due to the text being so small and there are a lot of menus with in menus, I have found this true with most of my Blu-Ray movies like Sucker Punch, Fight Club, and Watchmen. But I highly recommend it to any body who likes comics, music, and games all rolled into one movie.
B0060AY85C|3.0|I have read countless books by Toni Morrison and I have all ways enjoyed. I enjoyed this book but it wasn't as good as her past books.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|don't buy it gives you a day and half a night wast Mont buy full it is better just here me
B002M9WW30|5.0|buy this set. Good quality Blue Ray, all the movies look great. It's also convenient to have all the movies together, although Rocky 5 has not been watched:).
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Very happy with this SD card holder.  Much easier to keep track of than the plastic cases.  It's perfect for me as I have a 16gb to take photos and 32gb to store movies.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book had a similar plot to several 'real life' crime cases.  I never did figure out what happened in the end.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am not an avid reader. I bought this book after seeing the trailer for the movie with Brad Pitt. I saw the book had great reviews and gave it a try. I'm very glad I did. I truly could not put this book down, as I wanted to see what would happen next.<br /><br />The amount of detail that Brooks goes into is remarkable. He thinks of many different scenarios politically, socially, economically, militarily, etc. that can occur during a world wide epidemic.<br /><br />The book is chilling and it even made me cry.<br /><br />I understand some people dont like the format the way the story is told. A series of interviews with survivors that doesnt allow for a central character or to become emotionally involved in one main character. However, the main character in this book is the human race. Everyone goes through the same crisis and they all share their experiences and what it was like for them. All the interviews are connected by the crisis (The Great Panic) and are part of the overall story.<br /><br />The book is very well written and alot of fun to read. The movie will not be anything like the book.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I am not anywhere close to the end of this book.  I believe it is over 900 pages and is not an easy read.  (Lots of French/English terms) as that is the period in which it takes place.  I'm hoping it will become more interesting because I don't want to give up on it yet.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|He's done it once again!<br /><br />Mr. Taleb's previous books, Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan have had an impact on my way of thinking in not only financial matters, but life in general; all for the better.<br /><br />In Anti Fragile, he's done it once again by proving actionable insights into how I can manage my life not just to avoid the numerous pitfalls which lay before us, but to actually thrive on account of struggles.
0547884591|4.0|As a fan of Tim's previous work, I've had this book in mind for almost a year. In fact, I can now say that my Christmas gift for 2011 has finally arrived!<br /><br />I've read through the first 100 pages so far, and am really enjoying it. Reading, when you look up to notice that sixty pages have gone by, is a wonderful experience.<br /><br />The first thing that jumped out at me was the beautiful, pleasing design of the book. It is colourful and laid out well, serving to make the considerable amount of information more accessible. I find that the information is also made more accessible by Tim's personable writing style, as well as his ability to define the specific through the use of a more general model. As someone who devoured the 4HWW and the 4HB, I am also benefiting from Tim`s references to his earlier books.<br /><br />If you`re already a fan of Tim`s, you won`t be disappointed. If you haven`t delved into his writing before, I think you`ll find that it`s fun and informative. I`m looking forward to 500 more pages.
067144901X|5.0|sandra boynton is a genius with children's books! my baby loves the vivid imagery and fun story. this is a great read for bedtime or playtime!
034580404X|5.0|Arrived quickly and excellent condition. I love them!!! Definitely recommend. Great books!!!! Don't leave lying around for kids to take a peek in lol.
0345803485|1.0|This book has only done well because of hype. The publishers must have known this would be the case when they accepted it. I  struggled to read it, it was a real chore. I tried really hard but couldn't force myself to read the last couple of chapters. Real novice writing, like nothing I have seen published before!
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|This app was easy to install, easy to use. It just did not do what I was hoping it would do
0316056863|5.0|Hilarious with the right amount of awkwardness. This was one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. It takes a lot to make me laugh out loud and this book did it on a number of occasions. I highly recommend it!!
B0086700CM|1.0|This game was easy to install, stupid to play and stupid to boot. I would not recommend you try it for yourself
B0063IH60K|5.0|the best tool for procrastination. My thesis can wait for another 10 minutes while I beat this hand! Assuming it doesn't take me an hour
B000JFDBXO|5.0|I love that I can rent movies from Amazon right to my Kindle. So nice especially when boarded to tears
B007SGLZP8|2.0|He had a chance to write a good book about an important subject and blew it with a series of improbable events
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This game was easy to install, easy to play and fun to boot. I would recommend you try it for yourself
B007K3JCAE|5.0|This film was better then first in my opinion.Even though the first film was the break through,this film made it better and definately diservse a sequal.
B004GYY714|5.0|It is amazing, radioi stations from all over the world; All USA Cuba to France in 2 or 3 touchs.
B00701897I|5.0|I wasn't sure if this film was worth buying because I heard the reveiews of the film was mixed.But I was willing to take the chance because it was on sale and most importantly this Speilberg film.I am usaully never disapointed with his work, and once agian he surprizes me.The directing,the cinematography,the music,I loved every minute of it.I recommend this to anyone.
B006OT03BM|4.0|Its nice to see the whole trilogy from the begining.The only two things I didn't like is that the first film special features did not have enough behind the sceenes content and that the built-in maganets that help keep the triangle intact doesn't really stay in place.But besides that,everything else is what I wanted in a package as this.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this book. I thought it had too much sex in it. On the other hand, I was interested in the historical facts of the book. I lived through this time and learned much about things I didn't realize was happening at the time.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I enjoy this recording of Daughtry in my car and at home. In the same vein as Nickelback, Lifehouse and Hinder with gritty vocals and rock rhythms.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think this is one of the best books John Grisham has written. I enjoy all his books and have read them all, but this one kept you guessing all the way through the end. I recommended this book to every one I talk to and especially to all my family. They have the same oppinion as I have.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I enjoy this recording of Daughtry in my car and at home. In the same vein as Nickelback, Lifehouse and Hinder with gritty vocals and rock rhythms. Can be moody too.
0553274503|5.0|I am completely inadequate to review this book.  It was way out of my comfort zone when I read it, but I just couldn't stop.  It was wonderful.  To be inside Charlie's head and experience his life;  his old life, his new life and eventually his painful descent back to the old Charlie was just mind-blowing.  This book raises so many ethical questions, everyone should read and discuss this book at least once.
0345479092|4.0|I ended up only reading parts of this book.  To me the Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems is easier to navigate and read.  It also has a better index.  This is more of a novel book than a reference book.  I did try to read this after my baby was born, so maybe this book would be better to read before you have a a baby, because you definitely do not have time once the baby arrives!
B003M6G86E|5.0|The GF got hooked on bones and this was by far the easiest and cheapest way for us to stream it through our laptop to our tv. I actually ended up getting prime after this because it streamed so well
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love this game, but the WiFi down load was a waste of money and time, as it would not work for my tablet. I give the game five stars, but the subject does say WiFi only.  If you can buy the game for X-box, do it. It is addictive.
B005LAII62|5.0|I really loved this movie when I saw it in theaters back when it came out so I just had to get it on DVD! The one thing that surprised me is that instead of it coming tomorrow like it should have, it came today, which was fine with me. Now that I watched it again, I want to keep watching it over and over because it's one of my favorite movies now! I would definitely recommend this movie to any kid who is looking for a horror film that also has some comedy in it as well.
B007TK77QE|4.0|This novel has had mixed reviews in New Zealand and a number have implied that it doesn't have the impact of Harry Potter so it isn't worth reading. They will have missed out. This is small town connections and in each of the characters we can see (unfortunately) aspects of our own lives and the lives of those around us. JK Rowling takes one incident, the death of Barry Fairbrother and then proceeds to see how this affects the lives of his family, friends and acquaintences. The characters I found were realistic. It was an easy, interesting read and one I recommend.
B007FRHZ4A|2.0|Tried to play this with a 6yo boy and he was so excited he tore the box open!  But then when we tried to build the first structure, he quickly lost interest.  It appears as though there was an intentional design decision to make the structures easy to topple because the blocks have beveled edges.  It works so well, you can't stack them.  I thought it was just poor fine-motor skills on his part but then he asked for my help and I didn't get any further.<br /><br />The other problem we had was the catapult.  The directions said to position it at about a foot from the structure but it shot the birds straight up in the air.  Any distance they got was because, after falling a few inches in front of the catapult, they rolled forward.  If you tilt it forward you can get some distance but then it isn't very repeatable and he quickly abandoned it as far as he game goes.  He did find it amusing to shoot the pigs straight up in the air for a while, then that got old too.<br /><br />So within a few minutes, the game devolved into me trying to assemble his structure while he amused himself by catapulting birds straight up into the air a few inches away.  Eventually I got out an actual set of cards, showed him how to build an A-frame structure with them (which he was easily able to do) and we put the pigs on that.  Then we threw birds at it from across the room.  He was happy enough with this but even he doesn't want the other set anymore.
B0063IH60K|1.0|The ads are absolutely horrible. They pop up all the time, and its hard to close them! That is reprehensible behavior for any ap! On top of the ads, I really don't like how the card mechanics work. Uninstalled after one game!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The plot line was a bit disjointed as others have observed.  And as seems to be the trend the lighting is so dark that it is often difficult to follow the action in some scenes.<br /><br />Haven't had a chance to watch the 3D version yet so I can't comment on the quality of the 3D.<br /><br />But the 2D version has quite good visuals, with the exception of some scenes that are too dark.
0345529057|5.0|These books were great. I am now reading  A Dance with Dragons and I just wished it would have been a part of this box set. I guess you have to wait till all the books are out to get a complete box set. O well
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Right up there with Breaking Bad, Dexter, and Walking Dead in my opinion for edge of  your seat viewing, and crisp, intelligent writing.
0446580848|4.0|Would perhaps have been better without so many wise cracks but overall the story was realistic and believable. Nelso DeMille is always as good read.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I grew tired of zombies not too long after Romero's second or third movie.  So I held off for quite a while before finally watching an episode of Walking Dead.  Once I did finally start watching, I couldn't stop.  This will extremely well written TV drama.  The zombies are there, for sure.  But it's really something different.  I watch this show with the same intensity, and tension that I watch Dexter, Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy and others.  Taut, suspenseful, and sometimes moving and touching.  It's just great TV suspense drama..........(with zombies)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've read all of Grisham's books and this one is a bit different than most others. Different in a good way.  The characters are nicely developed and, as always, I love the legal aspects of the novel.  Mostly, I like the premise and its progression to a suitable conclusion.  This is the oft cliched \\"page turner!\\"
B004LROUNG|4.0|All the characters were well drawn and it was wonderful fun to see how they bumped up against one another.  As a life long Chicagoan, I enjoyed the drama unfold in a local setting  too.
1932100660|5.0|Awesome amazing book!  Both scientific and yet easily readable at the same time!  Thank you Dr Campbell for this much needed work!
B00931K4HG|5.0|This is a nice collection of beautiful, simple, melancholy acoustic guitar/piano songs that are not too earnest/emotional or sparse as others in the same style often are. It's similar to Nick Drake and to Iron & Wine's first couple of albums, which I also like quite a lot. I haven't found many albums that fit this description, so I'm grateful to Neil Halstead for making this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this site for all the different ideas that people has posted. See what the interests of my famlies and friends on here.
B007YOC4RW|5.0|I love blues and classic rock. I'm familiar with JB, but decided to pick this album up after I was invited to go a JB concert. It's just great music if you like Blues or Rock. He has a great voice and is obviously a very skilled guitarist.
B0087K3VTW|5.0|A quirky tale that crosses cyberspace with ancient typography. The characters are appealing and the plot is suspenseful. The last chapter is a little clunky, nevertheless it's one of the best reads I've had in a long time. I'll go looking for more Robin Sloan.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good book, seriously worth every penny, but in an effort to keep sensitive information classified (WHICH IS IMPORTANT!!) you can really tell that he left a lot of cool stuff out, which is understandable but still a bit of a let down.
0345803507|5.0|I loved all the three of the books the last one is always the more intense due to the fact that you just want to know the end. I will totally recommend all three.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Good value and all of the discs worked fine. A great way to watch and enjoy with out commerical interruption.
0345803493|5.0|I loved this book just like the other too. Perfect way to loose your mind on this sexual and dark book. Loved the end.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Classic Sci-fi Horror with an eye towards cosmological questions that challenge the common thinking of most people. This movie will make you think, if nothing else.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|It works i have seen people complaining about this product about leving marks in the back , for me the problem was solved with a piece of clear plastic actually the peeling of the screen protector that came with it excellent product
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I love this album. Yes, it is different than his others. That's what makes him such a talented musician and composer. He is so diverse. He doesn't follow fads of music. But he does stretch himself as a composer. He travels and learns music from others and incorporates different types as in his album Ethnicity. Then, he changes and comes out with Voices. Everyone has their own opinions of his music. That's the case with anyone's music. But with Yanni, it takes listening to it, sometimes many times, taking the title into mind also, and through out the metronome and logical mind. Just listen with your emotions and your heart. There's a different type of message or feeling with every song. They are all very beautiful.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I am not usually a fan of novellas but being a huge fan of Sanderson's I gave it a try.  I devoured it in one night.  He was able to set up a whole new world with a whole new magic system in this short book.  Definitely a must read.
0345803485|5.0|I found out about this book on Reddit. They seemed to like it so I decided to do a little research on it. Then I discovered that it was based on the Twilight series. I'll admit that I'm a Twilight fan and have read the whole series like ten times so I know that the main characters do have simalarities but the plot is not the same.<br />Has a good storyline with characters that you will never think would end up together. In my opinion they are made for each other because they balance each other out.<br />At the beginig Ana is not really secure with herself but as the series progresses she has a good character growth. I personally don't like her but I never like the main character on any book I have read. But in general she is okay.<br />Christian Grey is quiet a character. I think is good that this series shows what the life of a person like him is and why it is that way. Even though I hate men that are controlling and unreasonable he somehow captured my attention. As the series progresses I find myself wanting to know more about him.<br />The plot for this book is not as good as the next two books but it is a good intro.<br />This is a book that you will love or hate but I recommend giving it a chance. Just remember to keep an open mind and don't compare it to Twilight.
B0041KWCV0|1.0|This product did arrive on time.  However let me say that I ordered this product not knowing about different regions which affect the playing of a movie  in your dvd player.  I had always assumed that if it was in english you were good.  I looked for that and that was it, so it will not play  in my player.  I contacted the seller admitting my mistake and asked if they could help me in some way they have yet to contact me.  This was about 2 weeks ago.  Contacted them through Amazon so I'm pretty sure they got the email.  I guess they feel it was my mistake so.....
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Purchased this item for my wife and I haven't heard her say one bad thing about this item.  Just like the picture shows it works great when watching a show on it and you want to prop up the kindle.  100% would recommend this for others.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|It's an awesomely entertaining as long as you<br />Go into it knowing its not high budget and going to be a cult classic
B0086700CM|1.0|I've had this for a small while.  I have had apps that have froze this didn't but really not a top of the line application.  Just overall not a well made application in my opinion.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|Ordered and received my box set pretty early in the release. Didn't open right away...read the reviews as they came in...after about 90 reviews they were split pretty evenly. Some said absolutely no issues, perfect. The other end of the spectrum - lousy pressings (discounted the  reviews critical of the sampling rates, etc...focused on the vinyl quality). As one reviewer said, either here or elsewhere - we actually listen to vinyl because we like it. So I randomly selected one LP (Revolver), and played it. I have a decent (read: pretty good - but not high end audiophile) turntable. And I listen to a lot of vinyl. First I did a visual inspection under bright natural light. Disappointed. A lot of visible flaws and blemishes - not just in spots but across the whole record surface. But hey, I am fair. So I played it. Got as far as into `Eleanor Rigby' (second track) and heard numerous instances of distortion and noise - certainly not to be expected from brand new 180g vinyl pressing. So am exchanging - hoping to get on the other side of the 50/50 and among those that got a `perfect set' - as I really want this set. But if my replacement set comes in and are also defective, I will ask for a refund.<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />UPDATE 12/10/2012<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />I received my replacement. It was boxed for shipment very well-protected (better than the first). I am through listening to the first four LPs, up to \\"Beatles for Sale\\", with no audible issues. Close inspection of each record as I removed them from their sleeves showed only occasional, minor light smudges - nothing at all like the first set. I opened the book on this set - it is outstanding. So far so good...<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Update 12/19/2012<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Raised my review to 4 stars. Still having very good success with the new set. No (physical) issues with LP's, book is great, packaging and shipment, very good. And Amazon made the exchange a very easy process...good. And Amazon made the exchange a very easy process...
0143120530|5.0|I definitely love this book and all the stories, scientific researches that he analyzed, especially how he met those people personally and got to know them. In addition to an exploration in the research of people's memory, the study of the lost memory skills of the medieval, Foer talks about his own exploration in training his memory as well. I tried to codify some figures with images but gave up in the middle. I had to say that really needs huge perseverance.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|This a good book. The characters are well-written and developed, the disparate parts of the story are brought together in a coherent way, and the ending makes sense. BUT...it just wasn't up to scratch. I don't usually put much stock into book reviews, but when everyone's throwing around words like \\"virtuosic\\" and \\"revolutionary\\", I can't help but hope for a little bit more. So if you're expecting, like I was, an epic, wholly original tale with a profound meaning, you're likely to be disappointed.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas ends up being a morality tale, albeit a very intricate one that employs some unusual literary tricks. Despite my disappointment, I couldn't say I altogether disliked the book because it was quite good for its genre. If your expectations have not been elevated by the reviews or the movie trailer, you will probably enjoy this very much.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I read this book after my best friend, a mother of 2, couldn't contain her excitement over it. I'm currently living in Germany, and she and I have had several discussions about how differently European children seem to behave than their American counterparts. Druckerman covers the French approach to parenting as she herself experiences it, which brings the book a great deal of readability, and she writes about Paris, which is always a plus. I especially appreciated a theory or approach to parenting that didn't leave me feeling bruised from the back and forth, too. I don't have children, so I read it not only to understand my friend's views, but also as a theory of how to live. Slow down, pause, observe, treat yourself well, and live mindfully. I felt like she ventured a little too often into the diet of the French women (which, interestingly, I have not seen any evidence of her observations during my time in Paris - I lived their last year), which felt a little off-course to me. Otherwise, though, I thought this was an interesting and enjoyable read offering an interesting perspective on a different approach to parenting, and indeed, living.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you love this show you can't go wrong having it on hand to watch any time. Sure everything is digital now but with a DVD copy you can pass it along to all your friends.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hate that I have to wait a week between each episode because they are so good! I absolutely love it!
1576754227|5.0|I've read a number of books on procrastination and time management. Brian Tracy's book prove to be the most simplistic and yet very practical and easy to follow. He cut all the psychological craps and straight to the points. True that most of them are something we've known and read somewhere but the way he put them together really inspired me to follow truthfully this time and I think it's working....
B007MDB6L0|4.0|I liked this movie. I only have one son, and he hated it. Too bad. He had to sufffer through it ;)
B004LROUNG|4.0|Another good story line from John Grisham. John has a good way of weaving different stories together,  bringing them to a conclusion that is not always expected.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like doing puzzles, but hate the mess that it causes. This app makes doing a puzzle less messy and a lot more fun! It's a wonderful app!
B009LUBA7M|5.0|Everything that Mika makes is gold! I love that I could download his album so easily and without any hassle. Thanks Amazon!
B002BVOYBW|5.0|I love this movie and when I saw that it was available on my Kindle, I just had to get it! I love Johnny Depp and this movie just furthers my love of his work.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I've been watching the Blu-ray for a few days now.  As a long-time Zeppelin fan, I find the performance is just breathtaking.  It exceeds all my expectations.  Despite all the admiration and respect I have for the remaining members and for Jason Bonham, I think part of me was a bit skeptical: would they be able to pull it off- to do not just a good show, but a show that measures up to the Zeppelin name and legacy?  Well I'm happy to say that the answer, for me at least, is yes.  Absolutely.  There are versions of songs here that are fresh and inspiring, and stand very well next to the original studio versions:  Ramble On, Black Dog, For Your Life, Since I've Been Loving You, Kashmir, and my favorite right now, No Quarter.  The sound is superb throughout.  Page is in amazing form.  He delivers the riff-based architecture of the songs with power and precision.  His solos aren't as long as they were in the 70s, but they have a new perfection to them- they are extremely well thought out, and always played with just the right texture and intensity.  And what about Plant?  Years of singing diverse types of music have made him a seasoned and nuanced singer, in some ways better than he was in Zep's heyday.  John Paul Jones' playing is impeccable, always steady and melodic, at times creative and playful. The lynchpin of it all is Jason, thundering like his dad, but with a style that is in many ways all his own, and extremely well suited to the Zep catalogue.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended for Zep fans and rock fans generally.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addictive! I love the different levels and the puzzles and everything! It may seem like a pointless game to some, but it is fun just the same!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I order this case for my mom for Christmas we got her kindle fire this year for christmas.. So she need a case this case is well made. We loved the way it look its just perfect. The case even better then pictures online show. .. great deal for the price!!! We are every happy with his item. I will up date after Christmas and so people know how it hold up to being used. I don't think she will have Promble with it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong and this app didn't disappoint. There were multiple levels and difficulties, so it kept me entertained for many hours.
B006KSAPV0|4.0|Shocking!!  Chilling!!  Twisted!!  I don't even know how to describe this film.  It is definitely a must see movie.  Antonio Banderas is masterful in his performance.  I still can't get the shocking twist out of my head.  This is definitely one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds is so incredibly fun! I love this app because of the festive backgrounds and stuff. However, I would like it anyway just because of what it is!
1400049628|5.0|I like this book, it's very educational. It has interesting facts like the best zombie killing gun is the 22 cal. Why because the ammunition is very  cheap light, and has just enough power to punch though the skull, and the bounce around in the brain. The book is filled with good facts. worth the money.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love the Mario Brothers Game and this is similar to it. I love the whole Irish-theme, though. It makes the game more fun!
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Similarities in development  of all the babies in this video show babies doing the same things, at about the same time, whether they grow in a third world environment or a high tech.  The color of skin or kind of toys seems to make no difference in how the babies interact and play.  The importance of a nurturing parent seems to be the factor that plays the most important role.  A good video to show that color of skin has nothing to do with intelligence.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love this application because I play the piano, a real piano. However, this is great for people who are just learning or want to learn classic songs, but are unsure about playing the entire song. I love the different difficulty levels, too.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I have every LP, and CD recorded by Bob Dylan.  Sometimes it just takes me awhile to get used to his new recordings.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I wasn't too impressed with this app. I thought it would be similar to Word, something that I could write actual notes on, but it turned out to just be a big headache.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book! It is a really great plot in the middle of a trilogy! Highly recommend!Anyone who read The Hunger Games should definitely read this one!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love playing this card game on my computer, so having it on my Kindle is great! Now, I can play it whenever I want without having to pull out my laptop.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|Not like the original Dark Shadows.  This was downright bad.  I'm a big fan of both Depp/Burton, but it just came off as being silly, awkward, boring and downright bad.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|bought these because I thought the HBO show was great.<br />First off, these books are LONG!  It took me a couple months to finish all four.<br />The first two books are great, but after that, they start kind of dragging. The third book is pretty good, but by the fourth book, it feels like the author doesn't know where the story is supposed to go.<br />I also purchased the fifth book in the series, hoping it would be better, but it was the worst book yet. I will continue watching the HBO show as long as it stays good, but I will not be reading the sixth book.<br />HOWEVER.... Do not let let my review  dissuade you from buying this set. It is worth it to read the first three books, just be warned that the rest of the series doesn't live up to the first two or three books.
0316056863|5.0|Hilarious. I had to stop reading this in public *cough* during class *cough* because I kept laughing out loud, sometimes outright guffawing. This is a great read. If you like Tina Fey, find her funny, I would definitely recommend this for you. Though a note, I actually never noticed that she had a scar until she mentioned it in the book. I had to look at the cover of the book to be convinced. I guess I'm not terribly observant.
B0043C29GE|5.0|Always a classic, makes a great gift.  This version is one that you cannot buy in stores anymore! I needed it for my collection!
B007BZM3HK|4.0|I don't want to like this song. It's overly simple and in general just doesn't appeal to me. Unfortunately it is extremely catchy and gets stuck in my head all the time. I admit it, I sing along with it when it's on the radio. In the end, simple though it may be, it's cute and fun.
1591844096|4.0|I have read this book a few times and always find something new in it! I would buy this book again!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I fell in love with Mumford & Sons first album - I play the songs over and over again so when I heard that this was coming out I jumped at the chance to get it (I even pre-ordered it, which is something I rarely do). If you liked their first album, then you will like this album. Great music, fantastic lyrics, some of the songs are just plain magic. Truly awesome band.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I have always been engrossed by history, and all his previous historical epics have been a learning experience as well as a great adventure. This one was equally engrossing from a historical perspective (even though I was more familiar with the period) but the characters and their paths seemed a little 'soapy' at times.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and addicting I love it! Every time I turn it on I can't stop playing it.
0061906220|5.0|I just love Pete the Cat!<br />He's got the right idea...<br /><br />My older son fell in love with this story in Kindergarten, my younger son, now in Kindy, has this book memorized...<br /><br />It's a family favorite.  It's a great learning to read book - it's got your sight words, your easy to pronounce words.  It's cute and fun and got some bounce to it.<br />And it has a message.  Seriously - I love this book.  We should all be more like Pete.
B000TEVII0|5.0|I actually like the music on this album so much that I even bought the DVD of the live performance. Truly spectacular. The women have such amazing voices and the songs are fantastic, some old classics redone beautifully. I highly recommend this to all fans of their old stuff and if this is the first time you're running across Celtic Woman, then this album is a fine place to start. The music is relaxing and just a treat to listen to.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I thought it was even more entertaining than the last two releases where Mitch Rapp went back in time to his early days with the CIA.  As uaual, The Last Man was action packed and fast paced like most of the other books from Vince Flynn, and I finish this one in record time.
B008RTE066|5.0|It was as advertized and quite well made. More for the hard core fan than the casual fan. They should stick with the basic DVD.
031620157X|5.0|I bought this book for my 14 year sister.... She finished it in about a week, and she loved it!!!! If you have a kid that's a dreamer and loves to read, then I would definitely recommend this book.
B0079J28NW|4.0|A really clean, crisp copy of the movie, great colors. I bought it for the sound track and the sound is excellent.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It was a good deal and I enjoy playing some of the games.  There was a special on buying the chips.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Product exactly as described.  Great job outta you. Thank you very much and I hope to do business again with you!
B008KE3960|5.0|I Love this game. Very addicting. I wish there were more levels to play. I enjoy unlocking the planes and maps. Great game.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book starts out kind of slow but then it has you wrapped up trying to figure out how everything falls in to place. Loved this book.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I used to eagerly await each new title by Alice Munro, and perhaps the excitement would be there for this book if I were reading her for the first time.  I still enjoyed it but first was put off by realizing I'd read a couple of them already (probably in The New Yorker).  What I liked about it is that, having read it's the most closely autobiographical, I may have learned something about the author.  What may be a factor in my not rating it 5 stars is that while the circumstances may have seemed extraordinary or meaningful to the author did not necessarily seem so to me.  That said, I will always enjoy her writing style and occasional insights.
B0010X745K|5.0|Great buy at a great price. No Problems with the disc. came at a good time and i had no problems
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I am enjoying the show.  It is not quite as good as Smallville was yet, but it is still good.  The more I watch, the more I want to watch.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I've struggled with the introvert / extrovert dynamic my entire life. I've learned a lot about how to work through it and how to turn it into something that works for me. But I'm always exploring more and I got numerous great insights from Quiet.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This show is visually stunning and wonderfully narrated.  It is because of this show that I have seen almost every documentary made (or narrated) by David Attenborough.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|If you haven't read any of Lee Child's work, you must read the Jack Reacher novels. They're full of suspense and action.  You can just imagine and SEE through his written words; but you never know what will happen next. They're truly hard to put down! I read everyone of them in a matter of 1 or 2 months,and having ADD/HD, that's a real accomplishment! LOL.  I had talked to my husband so much about the books, that he is now reading them. Good for him, not so good for me. It's really not easy to be still and not talk non-stop! Thank God for my 4 dogs, although I'm sure I am driving THEM up the wall now! LOL<br /><br />As you can read, I get off topic a lot! So back to Reacher. Jack Reacher is a retired MP and Lee Child takes you from Jack's childhood (believe me, it's not boring, and it is short), to when he worked as an MP, and, at some point along the way, why he got out of the military. (Lee Child really keeps you guessing). Jack travels all over the world and just can't help but find trouble. His adventures are wild and, sometimes inconceivable, but when you're reading the book, they seem plausible! That's how good Child is.<br /><br />By the way, I would suggest you go to Amazon Kindle and get a list of his Jack Reacher books, and get them in order. I started reading one of his books, without knowing about any order that they were written, only to realize later, how confused I was....imagine that!! It's still a good read whether you go in order or not, but will help a lot in your understanding of Reacher, if you do.<br /><br />So, if you like action,suspense,(and a little bit of everything else you could ever imagine) you'll love Lee Child's books!<br /><br />I know you hate it, but I really have to run now. Seriously! My bulldog is heading toward me with some monstrosity in his mouth, and worse, the dachshund is right behind him!  This can't be good.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very entertaining game that has enough variation to keep me occupied on many different levels. Easily earns five stars!
B0085A9HXS|2.0|I think my title says it all. There is a lot of action and some of it is on par with some of the better I've seen but it is such a horrible movie I'm not sure it swayed me (just my opinion) much. I was going to have some of the guys over to watch it on my home theater set-up, but after watching it I decided to save them the torture.<br /><br />Didn't like this movie at all!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The path of the Jeri is free is you get three stars on all of the levels.  the 1.99 price is for you morons who can't get any more than one star per level.  the fact that you even have the option to buy it instead of making it exclusive to the people WHO DONT suck at angry birds, they allowed people who aren't absolute wiz's at it have a shot.  if it had been only for three star players you'd have whined harder I bet.  I'm glad I paid for the game, it is awesome, whimsical, and everything I hoped for.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love Bones, and am glad it is still going for an 8th season now. Don't know how long they will keep going, but hope it's still for some time to come. Like the way the story is going for Bones - her character is growing and that is encouraging to see.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I am just not used to the tile patterns. I will try to find a game with tiles more like the one I am used to.
B003L77G8I|5.0|The one episode made me cry... but it was a good season. Surprise at the end, which made it even better.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is great mindless fun  and easy way to unwind.  I like that there are so many different games to choose from.
1451695187|5.0|Dr. Alexander's account is beautifully written.  More importantly he is a scientist who has studied the brain and can distinguish between hallucination and actual experience of a higher realm when normal brain function is eliminated.  It is a fascinating account of his experience and removes any fear of the death of the body.  He has not belabored the Christian message.  The NDE of the four-year-old boy tells the story from the point of view of a child whose entire environment is Christian and that may turn non-Christians off.  I believe God created all living things and is no respecter of persons.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Amazon Prime was running a 99 cent rental special, so I decided to get caught up on the Twilight Saga thus far.  The wedding and pregnancy drama turned out to be quite entertaining.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|I didn't watch it, but my grand children were transfixed.  They loved it as did their grandmother.  Good family viewing.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Having been a Diana Krall fan ever since her first CD I was a little surprised the first time I heard this CD.  Even knowing it  was T Bone Burnett and listening to the samples on Amazon.  After listening to it about three or four times I have to say I absolutely love it!!  She brings a whole new area of music to our attention and does it with a lot of emotion.  There are songs that you can't help but sing along with and that stay with you long after the CD has ended.  There are songs that are bluesy and deep.  There is not really a track on this CD that I do not enjoy.  In truth I had been becoming a bit bored with Ms. Krall's CD's of late and this totally blew me away.  My hope is she will do more Albums of this music genre.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|After so many months and trying the common web-popular solution of using an iPhone 4 approved charger with a USB port and a lightning to USB cable -which only worked when the iPhone 5 was close to fully charged- I can finally enjoy a car charger truly designed for the iPhone 5. Boy I'm happy!<br /><br />This is in essence the same Griffin model made for the 30 pin connector but with a lightning end and more amps to better fit the iPhone 5 charging needs, same coiled cable, same plug. I had one of those to charge my iPhone 4 and loved it, gave me many years of service, so for me this was a natural upgrade. I particularly like coiled cables, it avoids having a very long cable wrapping around anything on the front of the car, while giving you the flexibility to move far from the plug. I tried it and I got to the back seats of the car with the connector still holding on the iPhone. The coil is still a bit strong but it's new, with time it will get easier I'm sure, as it did with the previous one<br /><br />Built quality is good, cable is strong and the connector fits the iPhone as if it were Apple's original. The bulb is made of hard plastic -as expected and as almost all car chargers around- and it fits very nice and tight on my Prius aux plug. The cable is part of the unit, meaning there is no USB connector to separate the cable from the bulb. This is good for me as I don't have to deal with misplaced cables or disconnections while the coil is stretched, but for some people it might be an issue.  It also helps to keep the bulb very small and with a very low profile when plugged into the car<br /><br />Haven't measured charging time or compared them with the specs, but it fully charged a 25% charged iPhone 5 in a less than an hour, which in my opinion it's very good for a car charger.<br /><br />EDIT, August 2016: Well, after almost 4 years of heavy use the male connector of the charger wore down and started wobbling into the Lighting socket, causing erratic charging until not charging at all on one side and becoming unreliable on the other. I have never owned a Lightning charging cable for this long -usually the base of the connector gives up after a few years, not the connector itself- so not sure if this expected after all these years of use or it is a quality matter. In any event, for a consumer electronics 4 years seems like an eternity so I lowered my rating only one star. At the time this cable came out there were almost no Lightning car chargers available so it fulfilled a purpose perfectly when really needed, and for a good time. Now to an honorable discharge to the recycling binbecoming unreliable on the other.

1609611543|5.0|In March of 2012 I was on vacation with some friends in AZ for spring training.  One friend had a conversation with some people near our rooms.  They were out for a Nutrition Convention.  They recommended reading this book.  I was intrigued, and after reading a few reviews here on Amazon, I purchased the kindle version.  The next day I read half the book on a day trip to Tombstone.  I had it completely read before vacation was over, and had my last wheat crust pizza at the Denver airport on a layover.  What a life changer.<br />Since March, I have learned to live without wheat crust pizzas.  I have made some pizza casseroles and some cauliflower crust pizzas.  Both delicious.<br />Weight loss?  I tipped the scale at 215 lbs in March.  Today as I write this (11/30/12), 8.5 months later, I am at 176 lbs.  I am hoping tomorrow I can celebrate 40 lost pounds!<br />Other benefits?  I used to suffer from regular breakouts, even at 42 yrs old.  Once I eliminated the wheat, my skin has cleared up tremendously.<br />One benefit that I am completely thankful for is no more severe aches in the joints.  I play VB regularly in the summer, and the previous 2 yrs, my knees would hurt so bad, I had to play with knee braces and use rub on pain killer afterward.  Fast forward to summer 2012...I played all summer with no braces, and my knees didn't ache one bit!<br />This book literally scared me into a wheat free lifestyle!  If you are suffering from an illness that doctors can't quite figure out, or struggle to keep weight off, buy this book, and give the wheat free life a chance!<br />By the way...My friend that spoke with the Nutrition convention people...Has lost over 60 lbs...and is now proudly on the national kidney donor list...all thanks to this book!<br />If you happen to be one of the people at the Nutrtion convention in Arizona, in March 2012, and stayed at hospitality, we would like to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts for introducing us to this book!
B009EE1GC4|5.0|This movie was our Thanksgiving movie.  It didn't disappoint, and was enjoyed by all age groups.  Maggie Smith and Judi Dench in one film......fabulous acting.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I will come right out and say it... I like this version better than the original Broadway cast. Emmy Rossum is an amazing singer and actress and Gerard Butler is incredible (and so sexy!) as the Phantom. Even Patrick Wilson, who plays Raoul, is wonderful. The music is incredible, as always, but the way this cast performs these songs I know so well is the best part of the movie. I will be watching this again and again!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good for above toddler age entertainment (5 yr. and above).  Adults will find enough humor to enjoy this movie also.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This was a great sequel.  It avoided the downfall of most sequels by overdeveloping the characters.  They're action heroes they blow things up and that's all that we need to know.  The cast of 70s/80s Super Action heroes coming together in one action comedy was awesome.  Each played to their stereotypical roles while poking fun at themselves but still delivering what made them the best.<br /><br />As with the first, the action scenes are very well done - on the verge of unrealistic but not overdone with CGI to make it cringe worthy.  Good punches, good blood but not gore and hilarious one-liners that left me smiling and wanting more.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves action for action!
B008B68IEA|5.0|I think this is the coolest bed they have!  I love the details with the ice and it is a really cool addition to our Monster High collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it is soooooooooooo much fun to play I spend 30minutes on it s day because it is very addictive in a good way
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very additive game that keeps you coming back 4 more. if a part 2 comes out ill pay 4 it.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I purchased this item for my daughter's Kindle Fire. It is the perfect fit for her Kindle. It holds the Kindle very securely, in fact, I had trouble removing the Kindle from the shell. Overall, great product.
B001BWQVUO|5.0|I'm a musician and a Mom. My baby saw this video when she was 1 and Dudamel is her hero since then. She asks me to watch it a lot and I enjoy it too. It was a discovery for us. Now, we always look for videos of Dudamel. He's amazing. The documentary is very well done too. I highly recommend it.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is one of the most unique games the Rovio company has produced yet and can amuse you for hours (two to three) at a time. Plus the game is free. It has three different worlds (including Sandbox Levels) and I believe that they're coming out with a new world hopefully soon. But it can sometime get slow and can get boring after you've beat all of the levels. I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys building and creating.<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful.<br /><br />Mr. M.
030758836X|3.0|It took about 150 pages into the book before I became engaged in the storyline - much too long.  It finally grabbed my interest only to let me down again, feeling like I was being strung along.<br /><br />I determined that the marriage between Amy and Nick Dunne was just one big game.  Perhaps they deserved one another.  I really didn't have good feelings about either one of them - not much to like.  The conclusion was very pallid, lacking any degree of intensity - a big let down.<br /><br />On a positive note - this book had to take a lot of deep thought to be so cleverly written with so many twists and turns throughout.  For this reason I gave it 3 stars.  However, I found the book to be filled with tawdry vulgarity throughout and it certainly didn't add to the storyline.  I was turned off early on by this overused language.  I just can't recommend this book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Intrigue, double dealing, expected and unexpected twists. Timely middle east piece showcasing &#34;the man&#34; Mitch Rapp who is much more than a killing machine who exposes the cultural and moral differences between the &#34;good guys&#34; and the &#34;bad guys&#34; and who is able to cut through the clutter of bias, false testimony and charade to the heart of the matter and put down ignorance and stupidity with incisive brevity.<br /><br />Great read with super put downs and satisfying justice for the antagonist's many transgressions.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I have 5 brothers & they need this movie!<br />I also have 3 Foster Brothers 1 has 5 children<br />and used it for visual reality check on his behavior<br />to improve hisself and heal his heart for God<br />Its fanulous!

B007HACDLK|5.0|If you like action and suspense it has both. Started a little slow, however it did get your attention and kept it.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It fits the kindle fire hd perfectly (I had to return a case that was for a different kindle), and the color is a nice red.  Also the built in stand works well.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is amazing! thats all that needs to be said. it even has a meme creator mode and it saves directly to you camera roll! amazing is the only word worthy of descibing this app.
1423140591|5.0|Rick Riordan is amazing, my kids and I share these books they take them to bed and then I turn out their light and get my turn with the book.  It was in excellent condition, reasonable price and well packaged.  It shipped quickly.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|Ignore the negative critics; This movie is amazing. The music fits each scene perfectly.<br />If you like action, hot girls kicking ass, samurai, dragons, orcs, robots, nazis and more than this is the movie for you.<br /><br />The special features are pretty cool too, there are animated shorts to go with each dream sequence that delve deeper into the thoughts behind that scene.
1423140605|5.0|My son has collected all of Rick Riordan's books and loves them.  A delight for a mother of a 12 year old.
B008KWHM6U|2.0|I recently discovered TDCC while investigating bands who are classed as part of the 80's New Wave revival. My first exposure was the 80's inspired video for the remarkably catchy \\"What You Know\\". I watched a few more of their videos and promptly ran out and purchased both of their albums. I liked the nerdy school kid look with the upbeat and catchy hooks. I'm so happy to see these returning to music.<br /><br />But the problem with \\"Beacon\\" is that the band, who are still clearly remarkably young, are making far too much of an effort to grow up. While some of the songs on this second album are very good, very few are great. The debut single, \\"Sleep Alone\\", is definitely the best song on the album. But the second single, \\"Sun\\", is the dullest bit of blandness the band has produced, and shows them already going down Adult Contemporary boredom street. And then you get something as vile as \\"The World is Watching\\" to add to the horror. The strongest songs are towards the beginning with the catchy \\"Handshake\\" and \\"Wake Up\\", while the other somewhat pleasant background songs, such as \\"Settle\\" and \\"Spring\\", are saved for later in the album.<br /><br />TDCC need to step back and realize that the fun of their debut album should not be disposed of so soon in favor of being a more \\"respectable\\" and mature Alternative band. I'm in my early forties and feel that these kids are quickly aging beyond my years. I hope this is just their sophomore slump, and album number 3 will have a revisiting of their original excitement. I can't stand all of the usual cattle-written customer reviews raving about a new album when it's clearly inferior. I see that enough when Kate Bush releases a new album of snore-worthy material, only to have masses praise it as her best. In this case, this album is definitely NOT the best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it looks boring but the kids both play this Kindle version and LOVE it, so it's their review! There's a creative level that doesn't require you to build tools before you can use any, and the other level with zombies, giant spiders, etc that come out in night mode. Nice portable version when you can't load the XBOX in the car !&#62;)
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Thank you for this great movie.  I'm glad I bought it, because I have watched it several times and I am going to watch it many more times!
B005LAIGP0|4.0|Woman in Black is a pretty 'traditional' kind of horror flick that combines all the elements of horror (startling sounds, dark creepy houses, lonely location, etc.). What I liked the most is the photography and overall texture of the movie. Its BEAUTIFUL! the climate, the details in the interiors have been captured so well, it will please your eyes. The element of horror is not very different other movies, so this one will have average score when it comes to scaring you. However, the story is believable, nicely flowing and is worth the watch on a rainy day/night (may be that will scare you bit more). Most important part is, there is no gore, no bloodshed and no unnecessary screaming. Considering all these factors, this horror goes more in the line with \\"the ring\\", \\"insidious\\"  and such movies (though the plot is entirely different).<br />Overall scoring:<br />Plot, story: Pretty traditional, but nice.<br />Photograpy, location: BRILLIANT!<br />Element of horror: Average (or slightly above it)<br />If you are a horror fan, should this be in your collection? YES<br />Blu ray Audio/Video Quality: Excellent!
0143120530|4.0|Thanks for this book!  I hope my memory is improving - I think that it is!  I'll keep reading it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not well written.  It was better than the first book, but still  monotonous reading..  I read it  to discuss it with friends,ootherwise I would not have finished the book.
B0063IH60K|1.0|A program should not have ads that interupt the play.  This is a bad purchase, should be able to disable ads
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was much better then the fist. I liked that it moved a little quicker, and that is held  more of a story behind the erotic sex.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. It is so fascinating esp. since it's true. I recommend it to everyone! Excellent book.
1449410243|5.0|I started this journey at my favorite comedy site, Cracked.com and bought a package deal with The Oatmeal's book &#34;5 Very Good Reasons To Punch A Dolphin In The Mouth&#34;. Fantastic, they made a life-long fan. So when we heard this was coming out, we bought it as soon as it was released, and we were definitely not disappointed. This book is worth it, give it a try!
0783225857|5.0|This movie captures the racial tentions in small town south. Like the book you are taken in with the injustices in the south during that time period.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Perhaps I'm too old for hackneyed \\"Most Dangerous Game\\" knockoffs like this, although I found the performances of the leads entertaining. Everyone's a bloodthirsty sociopath in the near future except the Everdeens & Peeta, apparently. The anti-violence message is delivered with leaden earnestness while showing us gobs of good old ultra-violence, as is so common these days. But mostly the 'you are there' shaking camera style ruined it for me. Did Cloverdale make money? Ugh! Who finds this entertaining? Who doesn't get dizzy trying to watch a lurching image for longer than a few seconds? It's one thing on America's Funniest Videos, quite another when you've paid dearly to be entertained and get nauseated for your trouble. I'll skip the sequel.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Love the book, keeps you on the edge throughout, and has great storyline and many twists! I would highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is awesome.  I love it, can't find anything wrong with it.  Hope you like it!  I recommend it if you need a solitaire game.  I tried all of the other solitaire apps and this one is the best.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|This is a poignant and beautiful film and is a treat for all of your senses.  Make sure you have some tissues handy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|endless challenging fun.  I thought I was just getting a game to occupy down time, but this is more intellectually stimulating.  The bigger the board the more challenging.  Want a greater challenge, try solving puzzles while following the same color sequence each time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It has a mixture of space and regular play. Its fun and challenging very hard to put down.  better than the rest.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|it would be good if it was exactly like the ipad app. it won't load more than about 10-15 statuses. it kinda sucks because of that
0385344333|1.0|Like most one star reviews this was not any where near the level of past books. Jack is a taint; broad shoulders ;barrel chest;over 6'.Tom isn't even as tall as ex or soon to be ex wife. My imagine is so messed up now. Why not an actor that played Conan;Immortal;or 300. I tried to overlook the reviews because I enjoyed every book before and was so looking forward to this one
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game and wish I hadn't completed it already. The graphics are very clear, gameplay is smooth,and the app loads quickly every time I open it. It's also a ton of fun!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|It is not as good as the other Scarpetta books.  It is very slow and feels disjointed while reading does not seem like the same person wrote this one as the others.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|This game is lots of fun, and it can be habit forming. However, the way the creatures move around the playing field is weird, and sometimes they get stuck on top of each other, making it difficult to separate sea lions from penguins. When this happens, you just have to sit there, waiting at times for 3-4 minutes before you can make a move. Aside from this small problem, I enjoyed playing.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|My husband didn't think it would be a good movie; then we watched it and enjoyed it. Good action and a good story line.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i love how big it is and that shows history. i use the % symbol all of the time and thats not always easy to find on all calculators  thank you!
B009DKCBM8|5.0|I don't want to repeat what others have said about how great it is to have Neil back with CH and how great they sound on this album. I also don't want to repeat what Uncle Mozo already said in his Blu-Ray Review...I will add regarding the kaleidoscope visuals...first of all, taking a &#34;Psychedelic Pill&#34; is definitely the feeling you experience watching. Second, they appear to be studio shots as taken through the kaleidoscope. They worked for me. The black & white videos are along the lines of Americana.<br /><br />I agree somewhat with Mozo regarding Horse Back. I wouldn't say it was the finest thing NY&CH have ever recorded, but for a few bucks more you can get all 37 minutes of it, it is great, and you get an additional version of Pill. So if you are a fan of NY&CH, or heard and watched the stream on Neil's site, pay the extra couple bucks, get the extra songs, enjoy the videos, and...<br /><br />What I mainly want to address is the sound quality of the blu-ray. I was disappointed in the sound quality of the Americana blu-ray mainly because I did not feel they took either the time nor the effort to leverage the capability of blu-ray in the mix. I have a Spotify Premium account that plays through my decent 7.1 surround system through an HDMI connection and I didn't notice much, if any, difference in quality to the blu-ray. This, IMO, is fixed with Psychedelic Pill. I had listened to Pill several times through my Spotify account as I waited for the blu-ray release. I was very pleasantly surprised at the outstanding mix and sound quality of the blu-ray compared to Spotify; it was like hearing it for the first time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy captures your mind and throws you into another world. I absolutely loved it.. And I hope to see a fourth book in the future! :)
B009LK6JS2|2.0|the first couple times it worked great now all it does is flip my plane up side down and it just does stupied crap not happy at all
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is such a great book I  could not stop reading it was so good I am definetely reading mockingjay the next book
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Interesting interplay between the British and Chinese at this time in China. It was disappointing that the father was unable to force a solution.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It's a great app for getting in and seeing a few and marking a few likes, but is a bit glitchy for wanting to PIN items. For that reason, and the frustration that accompanies not being able to PIN freely, I am giving it a four star. I love that they are trying though, and no doubt, that in time this issue will be resolved. Thanks for putting this one out here for us.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Not quite as good as Where's My Water, but still pretty fun. I'm really hoping new levels are available soon!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Given that we no longer have unbiased NEWS in America....I would highly recommend this one be added to your Kindle and Android Phone. It works great. :)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Intriguing show - sometimes Claire's character is a little irritating but like the plot twists. I highly recommend this show.
B007VGXS8M|3.0|I think that the idea for Waldo in an app. is an awesome idea. I think that this item falls short for the reason that you have to keep panning your screen to find the list items and Waldo, and after a while you just get really dizzy. Would be better on a full screen computer. The Kindle was a terrible idea to play this. Though no doubt there are young people who don't mind the challenge of flying screens on a time limit to find items. If you are one of those people...then get this one. If you like seek and finds that are not high pressure, then best find yourself another app. I still love Waldo, but not this app on the Kindle format.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Love the action on this movie. Even my wife watches over and over. It's action packed. Recommended for adults. Young kids shouldn't see this. Little too bloody.
B003YCIE68|4.0|I had only remembered that awesome intro to the movie from when it came out. Forgot that it was a comedy-like movie. Good for young people and the child in those with a good &#34;funny bone&#34; in their body. I am not such a one, I would prefer an old type serious traditional story from the Old World tales of St. Nick and good deeds, and such. But, again if you like comedy....and a modern these, this is a great movie for you.
B004SRNH10|1.0|ok i like adobe and i whont to get this for my kindle fire hd so amazon needs to get to it so i can get it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved the story, couldn't put it down, although I must admit, the ending was lame!!! But typical of John Grisham.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Since all convicts say they are innocent, we are supposed to believe this guy just because of the first person narrative?<br />Sorry, while the book is an easy read, perfect for waiting room and bathroom visits, it was on the whole sub par for even Mr. Grisham's usual fare.
B005BOHYW2|4.0|A delightful read, not without its sadness but well worth reading.  For someone interested in flowers (and I am) it was just so interesting to discover the meanings associated with flowers.  Dont just give someone any old flower - you might be telling them something you had no intention of telling them!  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and found it well written.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I love Nelson DeMille!<br />Since the Rivers of Babylon through Word of Honor, most of his books have been fantastic, with Cathedral being my all time favorite.<br />However, Mr. Demille's recent efforts have been disappointing.<br />While The Panther was an interesting travelogue for Yemen and Detective John Corey is as entertaining as ever, the book dragged us through too many pages of &#34;when does John kill the bad guy&#34; until the we have the rocket ride to the beheading of the be-header, the ironic act of vengeance for our hero.<br />I dearly hope Mr. DeMille has one or two really good books left in him so we don't have to suffer through any more books like The Panther.<br />I want to love his writing again.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|A completely gripping and fascinating read.  I was completely capitvated by this book, made the more incredible as it is a true story.  Roberts' descriptions of his life as part of the underworld of Mumbai was fascinating.  The experiences he has had in his life are, literally, quite mind boggling and the fact that he has survived them even more so.  An exceptional read which I would highly recommend.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|this was boring godly i mean like who ever made this sucks and stinks and dont let me meet u god
0439023521|2.0|i understand i prob paid very little for this book but would rather have paid more because almost every page i turn falls completely out of the book. thats ridiculous and i am upset about this.
0375413405|5.0|I enjoy cooking but wanted to learn more about the art. After watching the Julie and Julia movie a few times I figured I should give the book a try to see how I fared with some classic French recipes. Well, I am either a better chef than I thought or the book was so easy to follow that even a beginner couldn't mess it up, and I think it's e latter!
0880793082|5.0|i think this is a really beautiful deck. def my go to right now and i would recommend it for some great artwork
B007ZD17XO|5.0|The best of all the match 3 games I've played.  Very addictive and challenging.  It's not so easy that you get bored after time.
1936608618|5.0|My entire foundation in Endurance Sports was learned from Bmack and the CrossFit Endurance principals presented in this book. These fundamentals have taken me further than I can ever imagine, having qualified for USA Triathlon's Age-Group Team USA for the past 2 years. This has allowed me to compete as part of this amateur/Age-Group Team USA at the 2012 and upcoming 2013 ITU Age-Group Sprint World Championships in Auckland, New Zealand and London, England respectively. This book is amazing and a must read for all endurance athletes!
0553801473|5.0|I began the books after the first season of the HBO series and have been hooked ever since.  When I began A Dance With Dragons, I was a little worried as the first few chapters were pretty slow and a little \\"odd\\".  To be honest I had the same feeling with the fourth book, but ultimately it was fantastic.  It was the same with DWD.  Once past the first quarter of the book, I couldn't set it down and it all came together.  So excited to see how they can put all of this in the series and ready for the next book.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|It was very much like the TV show which I enjoy very much.  I will soon be ordering the next one.  I love Castle and I like that I can get these books delivered right to my Kindle for a great price.  Thanks Amazon...You did it again!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|easy to use and helpful for storing things that you want to remember later. ideal for people who cant remember all of the ideas that they have, and you cant lose it like you would a notebook. I wish there was a sketch feature too.
B007XNAQLA|4.0|I saw these guys at the Greek in Hollywood and was stoked to see they produced a recording and DVD. This is a piece of history and the performances are worth the listen. Gambale does a great job with the band. I even think this is the best tone has recorded with to date.
B0037XPP84|3.0|Visually speaking it is a wonderful movie but as to the accuracy of the historical aspects of the period it is a film of sheer fiction. Cate Blanchett's acting is nonetheless, superb and she has a very good supporting cast.
B00936A2SM|4.0|Required listening for hearing how Masters interpret a trio setting. This has Scott Henderson showing-off...I mean demonstrating  (I don't believe he ever intentionally plays notes just to say &#34;look at me&#34;) that he can handle anything from blues to bebop w/ musical conviction. He grooves w/ DC smackingly.  I haven't heard much from  Jeff B in years, but his tone is beautifully humongous, groovin' and as comfortable as your favorite worn in shoes, and did I mention his tone...killer, really it is something many will be enticed to try and copy!! Mr. Dennis Chambers is groovin like he always does, but I didn't realize he can lay back and swing and still have that DC spice that keeps it all identifiable as Dennis. This should be a staple in everyone's collection of threading the needle of  high level fusionopoly the HBC way. This recording will probably go up in value as the years pass by, and it becomes harder to get.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I still find certain aspects of this movie a bit confusing and in conflic with the original &#34;Alien&#34; so I'm hoping that Ridley Scott can either tie everything together in a sequel or at least re-release this picture in an extended form that covers more of the questions it left unanswered. It would definitely have benefitted from a much better screenplay writer and one that at least was old enough to have actually seen the original and absorbed and understood the plot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Surprisingly fun. A good waste of time. Agree that there should be more coins in the beginning but have heard that you earn them pretty quickly after you level up.
B001PPGAJY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and it's far superior to the final one in the series which really disappointed me greatly. It isn't as good as the first one but it is still very enjoyable
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Great seasonal read about the joy of giving and a life well spent in spite of past regrets.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Addicted! Thrilling and intense. Love it!!!!! Couldn't wait to find out what is happing next. So into the book I couldn't put it down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game to play in my spare time. My 3 year old also likes to try and play it. Lots of fun for us both.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was consumed by this triology. Page after page,  chapter after chapter, book after book it was all intense, sect and thrilling. Stomach in a knot and some!!!!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|this game Sufis it freezes all the time and kicks you out of the room but never gives you tokens back! use bingo bash instead much better!
0374214913|4.0|I first heard about Mr Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore whilst listening to NPR on the drive between San Francisco and Cupertino on the way to work one morning and purchased as soon as I got back to my Kindle and I am glad that I did.<br /><br />A fast paced, thriller-come-detective story studded with a mix of steampunk and hi-tech references coupled with nerd friendly \\"in\\" jokes that wonderfully display the authors' self-deprecating wit and observational powers.<br /><br />Think Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency meets The Davinci Code and you'll have some idea of what to expect (in a great way).<br /><br />It's the book I wish I had the talent to write!<br /><br />The only criticism I can find is that the Epilogue feels as though it were hastily thrown to appease the anxious wondering what happened to the beautifully rendered characters. If I were to offer any advice it would be to drop the epilogue and start working on a sequel - there's enough \\"there\\" there in all the characters for Robin Sloan to stretch his wonderful imagination at least once or twice more - PLEASE!
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|This product has givin me NOTHING BUT HEADACHES this past month of Nov. I purchased my first Playpad early in Nov after reading, and watching many reviews. It looked solid and well made and was setup exactly for what i wanted to do with it which was play my emulators. Im going to give a timeline of my story.<br /><br />1. First of all the product says it only works for Android 3.1 or higher. But that ls bull because i have 2.3.5 and it works fine on my phone. THEY ARE DETERRING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THERE PRODUCT WITH GOOD REASON. Because this product is no good.<br /><br />2. The first nyko playpad mini i recieved was GARBAGE. The left analog didnt move AT ALL. And the A button stuck so bad that it wouldnt pop back up for 3 seconds after I pressed it. So i set up a replacement for it thinking to myself \\"maybe I just got a defective controller, the next one will be better\\". BOY WAS I WRONG.<br /><br />3. My second playpad arrives brand new. The first thing i noticed when i tested this replacement was that the A button worked as it should and wasnt sticking like it had super glue in it like the first one did. Then i went to the left analog. IT WAS WORSE THEN THE FIRST PLAYPAD I GOT. Wouldnt move an inch!!! But i didnt feel like setting up another replacement,  and i was only using the dpad anyway so i kept it. For the time being......<br /><br />4. AFTER ONLY 3 DAYS OF \\"SPARING\\" USE, the A button on this new controller was already soft and sticking inside of the controller. 3 days of only using the controller maybe once a day for maybe an hour a day and the a button felt as if id used it for 3 months non-stop.<br /><br />5. SO..........RETURN...................BYE BYE TO THE SECOND PLAYPAD.<br /><br />6. So a few days later i saw that the White version of the Playpad Mini was on sale. And i thought to myself maybe third times a charm. I ordered it. AND THEN, i changed my mind and called and CANCELLED my order and ordered the Gametel instead. Four days later I recieved mygametel, AND THE WHITE PLAYPAD THAT I CANCELLED THE SAME DAY I ORDERED IT?!?!?!?!?!?! WTH??  So.... i had to setup a return for the playpad that shouldnt have been sent to begin with. But i thought i would take it out and test it just to make sure that it wasnt like the other two. Because if it wasnt, i maybe would have considered keeping it. LOW AND BEHOLD IT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST TWO. BOTH of the analogs on the third white playpad were unusably tight. And givin what happened to the A button on my second playpad, i bet the buttons on the third playpad i recieved would have went flat after 1 use too. So.....<br /><br />The moral of the story is this.<br /><br />Save the time in your short life. And save the headaches of having to set up a most immenent return. Because this playpad is GARBAGE. If you dont believe me then go ahead and order one and see for yourself. I wouldnt buy another playpad even if it was 5$. GARBAGE.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have played MobilityWare solitaire on my phone and like it.  It's obviously larger and easier to play.  I'm a solitaire addict.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  I get great ideas, recipes, etc.... from it.  I would highly recommend this to my friends. Happy Pinteresting!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|OMG - I've loved him from the start and have been looking forward to this release.  He doesn't disappoint.  I love it.
B004H4XL7E|4.0|I took these notes while reading Pitch Anything. It's a great book and there's more to it than I share here. A recommended buy.<br /><br />Basics:<br />-Good pitching depends on method. It can be learned.<br />-Pitches are sent from the modern - and smart - part of the brain, the neocortex. But they are received by the old \\"croc brain.\\"<br />-This is not numbered based selling or being pushy. Both sides should leave happy and not feel like they were used or tricked.<br />-Keep it fun. Once the power shifts take control and direct conversations where you want. Give and take power. Let the game be fun for both sides. It should be mutually exciting not dominating.<br />-Selling makes you supplicate, make rational appeals to the neocortex and ask invasive questions.<br />-When explaining your track record of success people remember the average of your achievements not the sum. A few good strong stories are better than many weaker ones.<br />-Hot cognitions are unavoidable - you can control the expression of emotions but not having them.<br />-Don't create like or analysis, create want.<br /><br />You must set the frame. Create novelty and intrigue. The STRONG method:<br />Setting the frame<br />Telling the story<br />Revealing the intrigue<br />Offering the prize<br />Nailing the hookpoint<br />Getting a decision<br /><br />Framing:<br />-Your point of view is your frame (perspective). The stronger frame absorbs the weaker frame, when frames collide the winner has frame control and his/her ideas are accepted.<br />-When you are responding ineffectively to things that the other person is saying and doing, that person owns the frame, and you are being frame-controlled.<br />-If you have to explain your authority, pwer, position, leverage and advantage, you do not have frame control.<br />-Strong frames activate basic desires.<br /><br />Frame collision - instigate a mildly shocking but not unfriendly act. Use defiance or a small denial and light humor. This captures attention and elevates your status by giving you \\"local star power<br /><br />Types of Frames:<br />Power Frame - Comes from ego and status. Shows arrogance and lack of interest.<br />-avoid falling into this frame by reacting to it. Don't strengthen it. Basic power rituals in business settings (small talk, letting ourself be told what to do) enforce the other party's power frame. Abiding by rituals of power instead of establishing your own reinforce it.<br /><br />Prize Frame - when yo own the frame others react to you. Reframe everything your audience does/say as if they are trying to win you over. Even when you're selling, the question is \\"why do I want to do business with you?\\"<br /><br />101: Make your buyer qualify. Withdraw if buyer tries to change time, location, attendees, etc..<br />201: trial closes are crude and ineffective. Don't ask questions and seek validation. Make target perform a task to earn the deal. Remember, money can't do anything without you, the money needs you.<br /><br />Example open: `'I'm glad I could find the time to meet with you today. And I have another meeting right after this so let's get started.\\"<br /><br />Time Frame - When the room is cooling down don't wait for them to set the end time, that leaves you reacting. Running long or beyond the point of attention shows weakness, neediness, and desperation. Talking faster and forcing more information leads to less retention.<br /><br />Intrigue Frame - focus on relationships, you know the numbers will work out. Most intelligent people take great pleasure in being confronted with something new, novel and intriguing. Once audience memebers solve the puzzle they check out. When analyst frames are taking power, break through with a story, but only tell part of the story:<br />  Intrigue Story:<br />1.  Be brief. The subject should be relevant to the pitch.<br />2.  You are at the center of the story.<br />3.  Time pressure - the clock is ticking and there are consequences if it runs out.<br/>4.  Have risk, danger and uncertainty.<br />5.  Have tension - you're trying to do something but are being blocked by some force.<br />6.  Failure will be bad!<br /><br />Frame Stacking:<br />Creates hot cognition, they like the idea/you before they fully understand the facts.<br />-Intrigue-> prize-> time-> moral authority-> hookpoint<br /><br />Intrigue - stories about interexting and eccentric people. Witnesseing is brtoing, forced into action and overcoming something is better. Create a short and strong narrative that introduces characters who overcome real-world obstacle.<br />-Put a man in the hungle, have the beasts attack him, get him to the edge of the jungle, will he get to safety?<br /><br />Prize - I have one of the better deals on the market; I am choosy about who I work with; it seems like I could work with you, but really, I need to know morel please start giving me some materials on yourself; I still need to figure out if we would work well together and be good partners; what did your last business partner say about you; when things go sidewatys in a deal how do you deal with it; my existing partners are choosy.<br /><br />Time - scarcity bias. Don't be avert or aggressive with pressure, there is a real time constrain, bring it up and recognize it.<br /><br />Beta Traps:<br />Watch out for situations that will put you in the beta role, they're everywhere. To break out you need to do something that is mildly shocking but not unfriendly, this causes frame collision. Then quickly grab status, shrink the focus of the information being discussed to something that you specialize in, then pull away. Set a hookpoint then pull away again. Momentum is key during this process.<br /><br />Seizing Situational Status:<br />Politely ignore power rituals. Avoid beta traos.<br />Be unaffected by cutstomer's global status.<br />Look for opportunitis to perpetrate small denials and defienaces that trengthen your frame and elevate your status.<br />As soon as you gain power switch discussion into an area where you are the domain expert.<br />Apply prize frame for decisions.<br />Confirm alpha status by making customers qualify your status (light hearted/interesting).<br />How the Brain Works:<br />Croc Brain Filtering:<br />1.  If it's not dangerous, ignore it.<br />2.  If it's not new and exciting, ignore it.<br />3.  If it's new, summarize it as quickly as possible and forget the details<br />4.  Do not send anything to the neocortex for problem solving unless you have a situation that is really  unexpected and out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Movement:<br />The brain detects movement. Don't show before and after, try to show the progress but do so without threatening the croc brain.<br />-The brain reacts to social and physical threats the same way.<br />-Put them at easy, tell them it's going to be a short and easy 20 minute pitch.<br />-Tell them your track record of success.<br />-Explain the market window.<br />-Paint a picture of the idea moving out of the old market and into a new one.<br /><br />Tension and Desire Lead to Attention:<br />-Desire comes when you offer a reward, tensions arises when you take something away.<br />Desire: anticipation of a reward. Violate target's expectations in a pleasant way.<br />-  People are curious about things they can not explain but that seem explainable.<br />-  At the point of satiation the pitch is over.<br />-  You need to have tension as well for the person to remain alert.<br />Tension introduces real consequences to the social encounter<br />-  Don't manipulate the person, just keep them alert.<br />-  Push and pull, but not too much of either.<br /><br />Prizing:<br />We chase that which moves away from us.<br />We want what we can't have.<br />We only place value on things that are hard to obtain.<br />Hot and Cold Cognition:<br />Problem solving and calculations are cold cognitions. You can't have and cold cognitions at the same time. Hot cognitions lead to want, desire and excitement.<br /><br />Showing neediness is bad for frame control, erodes status, freezes hot cognition, and topples frame stacks.

B00846REIS|5.0|Wow. These two are seriously messed up individuals. Having said that- I think it is intriguing and just nice to see how they bring out to life in each other. Sometimes people don't realize they're incomplete and so broken until they meet the right person that brings the good and the bad out of them. And that's what they did. They connect, bring it all to the table, and radiate passion at just the thought of the other. This book was such a fast and enjoyable read. The characters were strong, intelligent,and oh so exciting. I did read Fifty Shades of Grey before this and I loved it, and while there are some definite similarities I wouldn't let that detour you from reading this story. It has it's own value and is definitely worth your money.
0545265355|5.0|Great series. The first book is the best, second isn't as good, but still good. The third is completely different, but i found it very engaging
B009X01D9U|1.0|Sorry I did not like this product at all, the suede on the INSIDE of the cover has a HORRIBLE odor to it.  It is that bad that I cannot use the product. it is also very bulky..also very difficult to remove your kindle from the cover once you have placed it in the cover for use, it is not very user friendly.
B007FC3AAI|1.0|This sucked. My movie turned green half way into the movie for 30 minutes. I missed the whole middle  part and had to skip forward to see the next part. I dont recomend buying from the seller.
B000031X5R|2.0|Not what I expected at all. Not a good quality of sound and I was very disappointed with the songs.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I would not recommend this game. It does not compare to argry birds. I probably will delete it. sorry Steve
B008518MOW|1.0|This was the worst movie not only of 2012's summer, but the worst movie in a very, very long time.  The script was lame and the one-joke pony of Josh Brolin as a young Tommy Lee Jones wears off in about a minute.  I wasted good money seeing this in a theater and I can't get my money or my time back.  Don't waste yours on this drivel.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love love love bruno mars and have not stopped blasting this CD since i got it! Thank you!! IT ROCKS
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|big buttons/numbers, easy to read without my reading glasses, easy to punch in without having to be annoyed because my big pinky keeps hitting the next keys. simple calculator with familiar keys. just what I need for everyday use.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I love me some Adele. She is an amazing singer. Only disappointment was my CD case came and it was broken and the center of it was broken as well so it does not hold the CD in the case
B006C1DH92|5.0|If you're about buying Fruit Ninja... Hold on a sec and check out the differences.<br />To start off Fruit Ninja is fun, but Puss in Boots is much better in most ways. In Puss in Boots you get a theme from the movie. My 2 favorite intruments are the drums and acoustic guitar... Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots has a good background music using the acoustic guitar. The music is very soothing and helps you concentrate on the game. Puss says a couble things as you play about how good or how bad you're doing. His comments can be funny, and they can sometimes motivate you to try harder lol. Fruit Ninja doesn't have any of that. Puss in Boots is just better.
B004WSX60M|5.0|A great set of old Johnny Cash. A lot of songs I'd all but forgotten about. Good sound and great price!
0316067601|5.0|A Christmas gift, this book has now been read and re-read, loaned and borrowed a number of times. An incredible journey by an amazing team of men that ended in tragedy yet the lone survivor shares the story with us. He does not mince words and tells us straight on how it was. It will stir your emotions one way or another.
B009ESIGHI|2.0|We love watching this movie during Christmastime so obviously I was excited about a new blu ray release.  Aside from all the other complaints about this missing song (which I won't go into), the picture quality of the movie does not appear to be much different from the DVD release.  It's very grainy and overall just so-so.  Every bonus feature is the same from the previous DVD release so nothing new there.  It's a waste of money in my opinion.  If you have the DVD, don't bother!
B007SGM084|5.0|Fast service. The packege came in the condition described and I am overall really happy. I would buy something from them again
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This was my first DeMille book.  I purchased it because (1) it was well priced (2) a fellow airplane passenger was reading a DeMille book and recommended him (3) the reviews were positive and (4) did I mention it was well priced?  While, at times, the story line became bogged down by wordiness, I enjoyed John Corey and found it difficult to put it down.  In my opinion, after this introduction to DeMille, I'd say he isn't quite up there with Baldacci or Deaver - but he's not far behind...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is FANTASTIC! It is written in an interesting format, but the story is so genuine, following the life of a boy during his first year of High School through a series of letter's he writes to an undisclosed individual of which we are never given the identity. It is a wonderful coming-of-age story about growing up. Though this may sound cheesy, it is not. This is quite possible the best book I have ever read.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Call it a guilty pleasure, but I really like most of the comic books turned movie genre. Some are better than others, and they aren't as novel as the originals, but I still enjoy them. If you like this type of movie - enjoy. If you didn't care for some of the others like Ironman then you should probably pass.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|5 stars because it deserves it. Could it do more? Sure, but what it does do, it does it very well. It adds mass to your camera, it gives you double the shooting time, it gives you a place for your pinky, not to mention the portrait controls. The quality is outstanding, it's a Canon. I looked at other plastic grips, they don't even come close to the BG-E7.<br /><br />If you've never used a camera with a battery grip, you need to go to a camera store and try one, you'll be hooked.<br /><br />I would recomend this to anyone who really appreciates quality, more mass for your camera, longer battery life, and would like a better way to do portraits.
B004VD3YIM|4.0|great app.... has many uses beyond simple curiousity. video quality varies by camera but is mostly clear. I would give 5 stars but I reserve that for apps with zero bugs
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love the accent...and the scientist.... and the yellow minions... and the kids ......and just about everything!  I havent met anyone who didnt enjoy this movie.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This game is totally adicting! Until something goes wrong with you Kindle and all of your progress is gone! I was soooo mad the 1st time that happened, so I deleated the app, and then retried it, I thought that maybe there was something wron with it. But then it happended for the second time. That is really bugging me! So I refuse to play it or recomend it until this glitch is fixed.<br /><br />#Frustrating  #Fun at first
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Doesn't beat my favorite animated movie, Wall-e, but its still a pretty good movie. I was not a fan of the bird, but there could have been worse plot devices. Definitely recommend for kids and adults.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|The game is like the regular versions, but you can also play it using different rules to spice it up a bit.  My 7 year old daughter plays it nonstop!
B0093LINVK|3.0|This seemed ideal to me as a HTPC, recording over digital cable and CableCard, but there appears to be a problem with the network card. Running at 1Gbps, the video in Windows Media Center pixelates really badly; it's unwatchable. If I fix the NIC to 100Mbps, though, then it works fine. That's really not enough bandwidth for recording multiple streams, though.<br /><br />*** UPDATE ***<br /><br />I've found a fix. Using a Plugable gigabit USB ethernet adapter, the pixelization is gone. I can record three CableCard streams plus two ATSC streams concurrently, all perfectly.<br /><br />I'm going to run with this for a while. If there's no problems, I'll segregate the HDHomerun traffic on the USB adapter, and connect to a NAS on the Intel NIC via iSCSI for WMC storage.<br /><br />I'm leaving this at two stars. Intel should do better. Their NIC is pretty clearly a problem.<br /><br />*** UPDATE #2 ***<br /><br />I've moved the HDMI connection over, so that it's no longer connected to the port right next to the NIC. The network now seems stable. I've added a star to the rating since this is now a functional solution, but it is disappointing that if I need both HDMI ports, then the NIC is unstable.
B0068THAGY|5.0|A D O R A B L E !  This is such a cute film.  As other reviewers have said, it is very reminiscent of \\"E.T.\\" and \\"The Goonies.\\"  Keep expectations low, and you will appreciate the spirit of this movie.  For pure entertainment value, it is worth watching.
1469984202|5.0|I enjoyed it very much, read the whole thing in just a couple days.  Loved how it progressed and the surprises.  Most of the turns in the book I should have seen coming, after you read them you think \\"of course\\"!  I think I read it too fast, still mulling over many of the ideas in this one.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Tried to use app and keeps telling I need a new version.  When I try to update says it needs to go to outside Amazon store, push okay and says it is unavailable????  Really??? Faceboook should be the one app that works.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Ignore the weird negative reviews about the game not working.  I think they were trying to get the game on some special $.99 deal or something.  I bought this normally and thing it is the best strategy game for a mobile device. If you like turn based strategy games, this is your game.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|A good sequel to a very good movie. The movie is dark and yet has its funny moments and a charm of its own.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is a good book. I enjoyed it very much. I will search for more books from the author. Highly recommended.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Always like these sets to have the BluRay for home and a DVD to take on the road or to a friend's house.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Jeff has always been one of my favorite artists....this album is one of his finest works since his time with The Willburys...IF I Loved You , So Sad...all of these standards remade by Lynne make this a worthy purchase.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|A few hopeful classic style riffs, VERY few...and Tyler ruins it all. Again. He's been ruining Aerosmith since 1987. No soul. No boogie. No rock and roll. Glad I didn't buy it, a friend copied it for me. The only thing worse than this is Just Push Gay. If you're just getting into Aerosmith, do yourself a HUGE favor and buy their first 7 records, including Live Bootleg. That's all you really need, trust me. This record sucks monkey sac.
B004NOH9LW|4.0|Awesome point of view for looking at interactions between twins, the dead and more importantly are own view of any situation.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very funny and a good story.best diary of a simply kid yet. Hope they come out with anoyher one soon.
0525478817|5.0|It's always so hard to come up with the right words to express your feelings about a certain book you just read that has made you so emotional and has left you a bit in awed. One that has made you fall in love from the very first words and that you knew would break your heart eventually. Like Augustus says in TFiOS \\"It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you\\" and it truly was. Even though this book had me so emotional during the last hundred pages, I don't regret reading it at all. I loved it so much, for the beautiful writing, for the characters that felt like close friends that I got to know in just a couple hundred pages and the smart ass and intelligent dialogue, it was beautiful and unforgettable that I just don't have the right words to do it justice in this review.<br />I just want to wrap myself with the words in this book and just roll around in them, like a quilt. I want to go back and start reading it all over again, because I miss it even if it makes me cry again, I miss Augustus and Hazel. I miss their conversations that made me smile because they were so weird and random but oh so clever that made sense and just made you think.<br /><br />I've never read a John Green novel before and I know now what I've been missing, I love great intelligent writing and this guy obviously has tons of  talent. From the start I knew I had gotten into something extraordinary, something that had me laughing with it's sarcastic characters, and even though were suffering from a terminal illness made the book a lot lighter and so enjoyable that I forgot for a while that the inevitable was meant to happen at some point in the story. When it did happen though, it felt like a huge blow, like a stone to your chest. I got that punched in the gut feeling and choking on my throat and then the tears just started pouring right out nonstop until the end. I know some people don't like to read books that will make them cry but this one even though it does, it's not all about that. It's about all kinds of love from family and friendships to unforgettable love that changes your life. It's about two characters that found each other and understand each other, something you don't see everyday, something special and real, not senseless infatuation but the real thing and you feel it as you read it and you fall in love with their story as well. And yes even though it's heartbreaking, it's worth it. The journey that we get to experience with Augustus and Hazel is not always sad, it begins as a fun one that will make you laugh at times and get these heartwarming feelings at others, especially during the scenes in Amsterdam.<br /><br />There's not a thing in this book that I didn't like, nothing that I can complain about. The relationship between Hazel and her great parents, the friendship between Gus and Isaac, I loved it all and even Van Houten for the role he played in Augustus and Hazel's lives. To end this review if you can even call it that would be to put an end to the experience with this novel and move on, but how can you move on after reading something like this? This is a powerful book that will definitely leave its mark on the reader, one that will be hard to follow.. I don't really rate books on here anymore but this one is a solid five star and couldn't be anything less.that.

B008I43DYU|5.0|I just got in a new Kindle Fire HD a couple of days ago and immediately downloaded this app.  I'd already researched it before the Kindle came in.  With the Kindle in the upright position this is a simple 4 function calculator with nice large buttons.  It has memory capability but basically does addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  Putting the tablet in the landscape position brings up the scientific calculator and it is a full function scienfic calculator with parenthesis, square, cube, sqare root, cube root, x to the y power, scientific notation, log and ln functions, trig functions - pretty much everything you'd want in a scientific calculator.

B008RV5K4U|5.0|I'm a huge Batman fan and I was very pleased with part 1. This movie did Frank Miller's graphic novel justice. I recommend watching this movie to anyone. you should also read the graphic novel if you haven't yet. I can't wait for part 2 in January.

B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Probably one of my favorite movies of all time, Tim Burton's Batman is a fantastic rendition of our favorite caped crusader. This was the first movie I remember seeing as a child and Ive been a Batman fanatic ever since. If you haven't seen it WTF is wrong with you?!?! It has some flaws when compared to the Comic but still a great movie.

No lame shots of some dude yelling yeah into the camera or aged chicks singing and swaying. Thank you Mr. Carruthers! The band was solid that night 5 years ago. Sure they're older, but the music still holds up and kicks butt. I was one of the 3 million who didn't get to attend this show, but I'm glad they gave us this early Christmas gift this year.

B008518MOW|1.0|This review is about Ultraviolet not the movie. I just purchased the combo pack with UV, and as an added \\"bonus\\" for me was that the package indicated a downloadable copy (no further details). What this actually means is that you must have Flixster or VUDU in order to access this feature or the \\"download\\" the movie.<br /><br />If you loved the movie, which is the primary reason I purchased this product, then you already know what you are getting, but do not be fooled by the \\"download\\" label on the package thinking it is compatible with iTunes or any other app.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Until Daniel Craig took over the role with \\"Casino Royale,\\" I was never a big James Bond fan. I enjoyed some of the films, but I never found him to be a very compelling hero. At times, he even seemed like a parody of male fantasy - an infallible, oversexed, entitled alpha male. Craig brought new life into the character, making him a scrappy, visceral hero, and with his piercing gaze revealed a depth to the character I had never seen before.<br /><br />Whether it's a response to the tough times we've living in, or strictly a matter of creative direction, James Bond 2012 is no longer living a male fantasy. Sure, he still has the ability to seduce and bed beautiful women, but aside from that, things have gotten tough. In the beginning of \\"Skyfall\\", Bond is accidently shot by his own team while on top of a moving train, where he falls hundreds of feet into a body of water. Thought dead, he takes the opportunity to disappear for a while and enjoy the anonymous life. It's only when MI6 is attacked on their own turf and the results are so overwhelming that it makes the international news that Bond decides to reemerge.<br /><br />Upon his return, Bond is no longer in top form. Craig is far from the oldest actor to play the character, but his superiors and co-workers seem to think he's too old to be continuing as a field agent. His injuries have left him with an unsteady trigger finger, and his heavy drinking and pain medication have made him a liability. M (Judi Dench) only clears him to return to action out of a mix of desperation and loyalty. 2012's James Bond is no longer a superhero. He's tough, stoic, and brave, but he's no longer the alpha male - he's the underdog.<br /><br />Bond goes about tracking down the man who both blew up MI6's headquarters and is now revealing the identities of covert field agents (guaranteeing their deaths.) When he does come across Silva (Javier Bardem), that's when things get really interesting. In the case of \\"Skyfall\\", not only is the hero a much more interesting character, but the villain is fascinating. A disgraced and destroyed former MI6 agent himself, the character seems to want nothing more than to destroy his former boss M by first destroying everything that means anything to her - her reputation, her co-workers, and her country.<br /><br />In the film's final act, Bond takes M to \\"Skyfall,\\" the Scottish estate where he was born and raised. The most logistically safe place to do final battle with Silva is also Bond's most emotionally dangerous territory - the place where he lost his parents as a boy. It's here that the three damaged, strong central characters - Bond, M, and Silva - have to face themselves and each other.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is an example of an elevated action film. When I grew up in the 80's, action films were mostly populated by hack actors, with weak storylines and mediocre directing. Skyfall utilizes a talented filmmaker (Sam Mendes, the man behind \\"American Beauty\\"), powerhouse actors (Craig, Bardem, and Judi Dench are all wonderful) a strong script and lush cinematography to prove, once again, that any genre of film can be elevated when the people behind it have the talent and skill required.ro a much more interesting character, but the villain is fascinating.

B004ZJZPXY|4.0|I will start off by saying this movie was good enough for me to buy it, it was funny and a good comedy, as most of the movies with these two guys.<br /><br />Having said that I did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would based off of Shawn of the Dead.  The humor was mostly on, but some of it just missed the mark slightly which detracts from the overall movie for me.<br /><br />It is worth buying if you can get a decent deal on it.  4 Stars.
B002ZG999U|1.0|Would be a decent action movie if you could see the action. Turn out the lights the party is over.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is a excellent sequel to the first one, Fall of Giants. The story develops greatly among the different real facts of the 2nd WW and the start of the cold war. Besides the novel, for me it was an interesting history lesson. I recommend for readers to re-read the Fall of Giants, if they have read it long ago, so they could remember all the characters and situations that continue to appear in this sequel. I also recommend to read this more than a chapter per session or per night to be able to tie all the different stories that develop in the book and which tend to merge towards the end. I did not do this, I read one chapter or less per night (too tired and sleepy always at the end of the day) and I have trouble remembering how did a story end in the previous chapters.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have been a Nelson Demille fan since The Charm School, and he is one of the few authors whose books I will buy before they come out in paperback.  This one does not disappoint. While probably not his very best, it is still hard to put down, once you are into it. The plot line, totally plausible in the world in which we live, is intricate enough to be challenging and engaging, yet simple enough to follow. John Corey - wise-cracking, stubborn, at times irascible, occasionally annoying - is clearly the good guy here.  I recommend The Panther highly.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyable fast paced with lots of twists. Keeps you guessing right up to the end. Interesting characters kept plot moving.
B000031WBV|5.0|It's hard to go wrong with any Chopin well-performed, and Rubinstein remains, in my opinion, the consummate performer of Chopin.  While he may have lost some of the power and passion of his younger years, he has lost none of the nuance and delicious subtlety.  No lover of Chopin should be without this collection.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was amazing and fun to read.  I couldn't stop reading, and found myself thinking about what would happen next when in wasn't reading (like at work).
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I woke up this morning to this movie playing on the tv. I was glued. Any father regardless of your faith, belief, stand on religion should watch this movie with your kids. It is a powerful movie, absolutely awesome!!!!!!!! I ordered 6 of these DVD,s for Xmas.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Great movie, fun music and good story!  This is a must see for all families!  The combo pack is nice for those who have more than one place to play a movie and only one blu-ray.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I loved this movie for the pure enjoyment of having the shoe be on the other foot and having men being objectified.  The chiseled bodies of these men made this movie a guilty pleasure ;).  Weak plot was made up with the distraction of beautiful men.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I've just recently started reading this book by Nicholas Sparks. I think I've read everything he's written<br />so I'm a true fan.  Give it a chance if you don't like the beginning.  It starts off kind of thin, but the more<br />I read the &#34;meatier&#34; it becomes.  There's more here than a love story. So I'll continue to the end. Hopefully,<br />Mr Sparks will keep getting better and better.  So far so good - he's headed in that direction with this<br />book.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|The game play is good but the built in keyboard is a pain. I have to jam the keys really hard and sometime.es several times which uses up my time. Very frustrating!
B000W91RUG|5.0|What can i say? THIS IS THE BIG BANG THEORY! I got it on Black Friday on Amazon. Was totally worth it.
B000KKJXGM|5.0|If anyone remembers the movie based on this with Richard Chamberlin then you will know it is a good book. There is also a second volume. I believe that it is a factual accounting of the time. I enjoyed the movie and the book. Another historical read.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Another great offering from a great band.<br />Not sure where the evolution of muse is headed but they're sounding great.
B007SGM084|5.0|great story, I really enjoyed. I actually missed the characters once i was finished with the trilogy. its a must read!
B002J2PB10|5.0|Of all the movies with tough girls, the girls in this movie are the toughest.  VERY entertaining movie, not your usual.  It's not even the type of movie I typically like, but the way this one was filmed, and the quality of the acting, and just the whole look of this movie have made it one of my favorites!
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|New songs are great! Can't get enough of this CD! Lana Del Rey is amazing. Gods and Monsters is an instant attention grabber.
B006VREHRS|1.0|I just couldn't stand the constant horrible music any longer and gave up 1/2 way through the 2nd episode.  VERY ANNOYING.  VERY, VERY ANNOYING.  Grating.  Like fingernails on a chalkboard.  And I really, really WANTED to like this show.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very addictive game. I like the puzzle part of the game. Wish there were more coins to play longer without purchasing them.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|The writing is becoming increasingly darker and darker from a phychlogically point of view.  This ones has a great deal of converging action with respect to the character's own thoughts and activity my multiple characters all at the same time.  Thus sometimes it is hard to follow who is thinking what and what is the action context the thoughts are imbedded into.
B000005RMY|2.0|I have to write that this was a waste of my money. There is no life in this music, and I'm used to hearing good things from these guys. Its too bad that the Sisters of Mercy only have three other studio outputs which are very good (First last and Always, Floodland, and Vision Thing) I know this is some of they're very early work but it would have been better if this stayed in the closet.<br /><br />01-06-2024 and still shoddy
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I LOVE this camera/ lens bag.  It;s got all the features you need in a moderate protection carry around backpack/bag.<br /><br />1.  You can move the dividers int he camera bag for whatever size you need.  I use this for lenses primarily and haven't had any protection issues and this holds 8 of my vintage takumar lenses of lengths between 20mm and 135mm.<br /><br />2.  This case has a nice small footprint.  It will fit in smaller spaces and not take up a lot of room, yet you can fit a lot in it.<br /><br />3.  The zippers are nicely rubberized .  I know this sounds minor but when you're using it a lot you appreciate it!<br /><br />4.  There are plenty of pockets on the outside to hold filters and the like.  Compared to much more expensive Pelican and Case Logic type stuff, this works brilliantly and saves you money to buy more gear!  I couldn't ask for more!
0792841344|5.0|They just don't make them like this anymore, mortuaries, cemeteries, big tall scary man, spheres attacking people and pure sheer evil. This is not a hack 'em slash 'em movie. Thank goodness for that. Instead this is a movie that really frightens and thats what a horror movie should do. Try watching this for the first time at home by yourself at night in the dark, I bet after one third of the movie is through you'll want someone around. This was considered a B movie but became a smash hit with the public. I won't say the acting is great, but the concept of this thriller is awesome. If you want to come close to dying of fright, then get this dvd, it won't disappoint.
B003ZFCBJ0|4.0|This movie was really cute with teenie bopper romance but also touching. I would recommend if you like romance & drama. If I told you any more, I would be giving away the movie.
B00000IMTH|5.0|For any rainbow Blackmore  Dio fan, this cd is a must. What great rock. Every song on this cd is a masterpiece. Kill the King is my favorite and a great rocker, other tunes include L.A. connection, Gates of Babylon, Long live rock & roll, rainbow eyes and others. This one is a classic. Why Blackmore let Dio go I guess we'll never know, but I believe they were at they're peak with this release, to bad they didn't go on to make more music together.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|It has a bit of something for almost everyone. If you like action/hero movies you will like this on TV
B000002LPD|4.0|In my opinion this is the best V. Halen cd with front man Sammy Hagar. The music is good and Sammy scorches with his vocals. I found this cd on Amazon used for a penny, the shipping and handling cost more than the cd so not being much of a V.H. fan, but a big Sammy Hagar fan I decided to take the chance on this and was not disappointed. I believe the mixing could been done better as the instrumentation comes out a little muffled, but all and all I got a great deal.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I just downloaded this on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I also have it on my original Kindle Fire and my ipod Touch.  I've tried others, but always seem to come back to this solitare.  I play it whenever I'm waiting for an appointment, or during commercials while I'm watching tv.  I think this is the best solitare out there at this time.  The only thing that would make it better would be to have a version without any ads.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I love the movie  and so do all of the family. We have made this movie a holiday tradition to watch it every year at christmas time..
B007SGLZP8|4.0|He is a terrific story teller...his characters are interesting and true to life and his work continues to be an enjoyable read .I always look forward to his next book.
0547884591|4.0|Love him or hate him Tim has changed they I view life and my surroundings. Don't read this book, let alone all his books cover to cover. Surf the pages and soak up what makes sense to you. I can assure you that you will pick up something that will change the way you operate. I can say that I am much more productive, producing better results at work and spending less time doing it. Furthermore I am spending more time with my family.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B008NNNF7G|5.0|Were these guys put in a freezer in the 70's and recently thawed?  This band rocks and reminds me of the best southern rockers of the 70's and 80's.

0547884591|5.0|I am a big fan of the author and have read his other books as well as keep up with his RSS feed. So some of the content seemed repetitive, but I still found the book to be very well written (It<br />s no small accomplishment to not have a book of this size not feel dry or boring). I ended up with a lot of new things on my to do list that I want to try out.
