B00EL8JCGU|4.0|I really liked this movie.  I felt like it could have been 60 minutes longer and filled in some plot holes, but I'm hoping the series continues.  As far as being family friendly, I didn't let my 10 yr old watch it but I didn't have a problem with my 13 year old watching it.  The language is clean and the blood is very limited.  Look on IMDB for a more complete review
B003F46RVO|5.0|One of the best movies fromt he 80's.  took me back to high school and gave me flash backs. all in all great film

B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I have all wise been a fan of helen hunt, This file really makes you think about people that are disabled. I was a little surprised to see helen naked but it was done in very good taste. Great film
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I love this movie! The quality was amazing as well. Very cool having good movies to watch using Amazon Prime. It's well worth it!

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I loved the book and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the air war of world war 2.  It was very well written and I didn't want to put the book down.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read the whole series, and I loved everyone of them.  I hate to see it end, but sometimes there is just nothing left to write.

B008GXHOFW|5.0|The game has great graphics,and easy to use controls. This game is a must buy. I think this is one of my favorite games ever
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Love it and I recommend for aspiring young people. Awesome, smart and interesting in each series. Make you wait for the good ending.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Enjoyable with lots of laughs. Good mingling of cartoon images. Fantasy, and fanciful. Downtrodden nice guy gets super powers and doesn't know what to do with them. Know he will win out in the end, and get the girl and stay nice.
1780891261|4.0|She loved the book, couldn't put it down. I enjoyed the fact she shared the story with me, great conversation time.
B000NY17J6|5.0|For Linda Ronstadt fans, this UK release is a must-have. It's a remastering of the two 'hits' compilations Volumes 1 and 2, now on a single disc. But while that's convenient, what it truly great is the careful remsatering which at last brings out the depth and timbre of the original LP releases. I had the earlier American CDs, which were a pale shadow of the originals -- in fact, I listened to them once, then forgot them. Now we're playing this disc every few days and remembering how good Linda was in her prime. It's odd that this remastering tribute comes from the UK and not from the USA, but just be grateful it's available at last.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Don't bother downloading this app.  It only has two heads that you don't have to pay for.  The controls are hard to use and some of them just plain didn't work.  There is not much play ability in this app.  They toca yoga hair salon, your kids will probably like it better.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I am facinated by the practice of law on television. But Juliana Margolies really makes this show. She is a woman torn in so many ways to be a mother, wife, lawer and she manages most times to balance it all. I never watched the show when it first started and decided to start from the beginning. The writing is outstanding and the building of characters is worth the watch.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is an awesome game that I love hop you love it too oh also I'm 9 years old and I loved it so much my little brother likes it to my name is Alexandria hop you like it sol (-:
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|The music was too crazy and the camera work was all over the place.  The movie was very slow and the party scenes made me feel like I was on acid.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|This is great product and must have for your Nikkor 18-55mm lens. It should ideally come from Nikon in the camera-lens case but somehow they chose to skip this. The price is also cheap as compared to Nikon Online Store. Highly recommended!
B001HN6918|5.0|I want to eat some steamed buns after watching Kung Fu Panda's search for inner peace. It's a very enjoyable sequel.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Better than I expected! I know that more things will soon be available in addition to You Tube and Hulu Plus.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|Disclosure: I have not yet finished the book.  This is a book you will work your way through over time. But I am already getting help from it. This is not the first book on meditation I have read, but It is one of the most helpful ones.<br /><br />Kabat-Zinn emphasizes early on that the goal of meditation is meditation -- awareness in the present moment. That encourages you to set aside extraneous expectations and measures. Of course, we would all like to be happy and supremely wise -- without giving up chocolate. Kabat-Zinn brings us back to a simple challenging practice worth doing in itself, no matter what is going on in our lives coincidentally.<br /><br />The writing is clear and clean. If you have been put off by the clinical and other material in Kabat-Zinn's larger tomes, this is the book that distills the practice for you.<br /><br />Mindfulness practice comes from the &#34;Insight&#34; tradition and this is a solid, non-judgmental, non-sensational guide to the practice. Highly recommended. After this, you might want to move on to books and CDs by Joseph Goldstein, Sharon Salzberg in the Insight tradition and/or Thich Nhat Han in the related SE Asian Zen tradition.  (Or you could start there and move on to this.)
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Not for everyone, but if you are &#34;into&#34; Star Trek, you will not be disappointed.  An exciting, visual and well thought out movie
B005DESVPO|4.0|great CD, but I wish it had more songs on it!  I'll probably buy some of this other CDs now.
B000066SBB|5.0|All hail the Queen.  What can I say... her voice is not just an instrument but a wonder. Soulful and aching on &#34;Do Right Woman&#34; playfull and &#34;up&#34; on &#34;Thnk&#34; to downright demanding on &#34;Respect&#34;.  All the hits are here including some great nuggets and covers.  I love her version of &#34;Oh No Not My Baby&#34; and of course her cover of Carol King's &#34;You Make Me Feel&#34; is the only version worth hearing on record.  She can make you smile, make you dance and make you cry.  She has been and always will be... the undisputed Queen of Soul!<br /><br />Worf
B0031R5K68|5.0|I judge a book from a fairly simple criterion - do I want to read it to the exclusion of anything else or can I put it aside and maybe abandon it for ever?<br />I have read all Dan Brown's books and thoroughly enjoyed them.They fit the above criterion!<br />In the same way I have read all of Wilbur Smith's books and resent any other duties that come my way.<br />In my eyes he is a great author.
B002BWQ6H6|3.0|The book was just okay for me. Read it for a book club.  I don't enjoy wordy naratives.  Some of the characters were very interesting while others seemed superfulious.
B007R21JJK|1.0|Over the summer my cousin and I built our first PCs. We had identical internals (i.e. RAM, HDDs, SSDs, motherboard, CPU, heat sink, GPU). His worked fine after he built it. Mine did not. Because everything was new, it took me a while to figure out why my GPU was not recognized by my computer, and also why I was having trouble with internet access. After several days of trouble shooting, and even exchanging parts with my cousin, I determined I had a defective motherboard.<br /><br />I replaced the motherboard from the retailer I had purchased it through (not Amazon.com). After installing it, I had the same problem as before. I tried more troubleshooting, but finally gave up and took it to a professional computer repairman. He determined the same thing I did on the first one. It was also defective. I returned it for a refund, and purchased an ASUS Sabertooth Z77. I have had no problems with it.<br /><br />After only about four months of use, my cousin's motherboard's USB ports have failed. He is going to have to RMA this product. So with his and my two, Gigabyte is three for three on sending out poor quality motherboards.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|I give it four stars for the good makeup and color of the film. The acting, not so good. It does have it points of terror here and there but not enough. I like the movie but it is not the book made into a film, So forget that. It is alright for  a rainy night and nothing else to do. But maybe others are seeing something i'm not,since it made a alot of money... Maybe I will watch it again and see what happpens.... Oh by the way the ending could have been better..B-
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I enjoyed watching the first show and look forward to watching other shows from this season.  Enjoyed watching this show.
1476727651|5.0|I found this novel to be completely satisfying on many levels. It brought many images of the original story in, and then took Danny past those events and into his own redemption story. I have waited many years for a completion of the events that began with The Shining, and I was not disappointed in any way with this continuation of events. I was younger when The Shining blew through my mind and made me forever afraid to pull back the curtain in hotel room baths; this book doesn't make your stomach hurt with the horror. Instead, the characters develop well, and there is excellent cliff-hanger excitement; you can't put the book down after a certain point because there is just too much going on and you HAVE to find out how things end.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because I am older, but I found that a happier ending was so much more satisfying than horror and complete disaster would have been. It was a  fitting and satisfying read, and for the first time in quite a while, I can say that I really ENJOYED a Stephen King book. I always like his writing, but sometimes I just don't want to go the places he takes me. This one was ideal for me.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|I ordered the wrong one by mistake.  I wanted the newer one.  So I didn't watch this one, I don't have a review
0321701763|4.0|A lot of interesting hints, but the dvd didn't work. I  learned a lot from ithe book anyway. Hope that the recent ones won't have that problem.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Great action the story is well told. To bring to live a comic book hero with this magnitude is outstanding.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Muddy recorded Catfish Blues in 1949. 12 years later, (1961) a little group of blues fans in England got together, formed a a band, took a line from Muddy's song for their name and became &#34;The Rolling Stones&#34; They played the Black Man's Blues they heard in the UK and brought it to segregated America. When they 1st came to the US, the Stones were asked if the would like anything special and Mick said &#34;Yes, We want to meet Howlin' Wolf&#34; and they said &#34;Who is that?&#34; Americans only allowed white boys on the radio in the United States in those days. The entire British invasion that followed was just English musicians playing those blues they had heard and copied, and they called it Rock & Roll. This night in Buddy Guy's little Checerboard Lounge on the South side of Chicago in November of 1981 was the Stones paying homage to their mentor and Muddy recognized the respect and invited them on stage with him. The rest is history
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Well written, well performed.  This is top notch! We never watched it during regular programming so we are streaming season 1 and really enjoying it.
B00D8JLLRQ|4.0|Just like in Sister Act the first movie, Sister Act 2 has lots of funny parts that had me laughing out loud.  Whoopi Goldberg has the talent to sing as well as to act.  Great movie!!
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|This is a good movie for several reasons.  It's true, compelling, romantic, heartwarming, and an amazing example of what can be accomplished when people (and nations) come together to solve a humane, or ecological, problem.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|GREAT App!Get information and news that fits your profile. I look at this app every day. You will enjoy this app.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show is amazing. My only regret is that I didn't watch this when it first aired. Jax Teller makes my heart palpitate. A lot of action and drama. Two thumbs up from this girl!
B009ZE27US|5.0|Ok I love how you can play tricks on your friends or your parents. I laughed my ass off when my friends result was 2000! LOL!!!!!!!!
B00DHRLK84|5.0|The movie was exciting and it kept you going to the end of the movie, I seen it in the movies and liked it soooo much that I bought on the 3 pack of DVD's.
1476727651|3.0|King's new book has a great premise, but he winds up phoning it in at the end. If you are a diehard fan, you should read it just to get that feeling of closure. However, The last half of the book feels like he was trying to hurry and finish.
B0001I562I|5.0|The movie was great and family and friends would love it. All rated in G content, kind of a syfy show but more with family.
B00EM7ZFP2|5.0|Powerslave is one of metal's classic albums.. It is a must own for any true metalhead... Aces high, 2 minutes, powerslave, and ancient mariner are all some of maidens greatest hits... the album is a must have .. also a great album to own for any young aspiring metal musician
B004EF65QA|5.0|I expected it to be another Civil War series and was pleasantly surprised to find out it was about England who also had their North & South issues.  Very interesting to see the difference between the have's and have-not's in what I believe must have been realistic way.  Great story, great actors.  BBC knows how to do it!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Useful.... but slow on my tablet, and freezes up sometimes on the phone. It gets the job done, for the most part, though.

B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Not a bad game, It passes time.  It is fun and pretty easy in the beginning.  Glad I bought it.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I too can't wait for season 4.  I know it starts October 13, so why is amazon saying January 2014?  Most of the shows that started their new season are available on instant video.  Do we have to wait until January because this is on a cable channel?  I don't have cable or satellite, nor do I want either one when I can get the shows I want though Amazon's  instant video.  Can someone please shed some light on this?
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|looooove it!  never been disappointed by any of bruno mars albums!!  great songs, i don't have any bad things to say.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I personally do not understand how anyone claiming to be a Rush fan,could dislike Vapor Trails...except for maybe the original mixing. This re-release of the now &#34;classic&#34; album, is like a completely different album all together. I am hearing for the first time, pieces lost in the &#34;muddy' original. The clarity, presence, & resolution is well balanced and superb. I was fortunate enough to see them on this tour at the Gorge in Washington state,simply put; amazing performance! It was there I also picked up a copy of Neil Peart's &#34;The Ghost Rider,travels on the healing road&#34; book. The novel is the counterpart to this extremely personal album. Without it, the album would not hold the same weight and gravity with me. All I can say is the album & novel struck a personal chord with me, and hold very fond memories of a very great time spent with my family. To me this is the most personal album Rush ever recorded, and simply to disregard it due to the bad mix of the original would be a shame. This new remix rectifies and shine light on what I consider a masterpiece!! But then again, I personally have enjoy every stage of this bands journey...I am a goofball in that respect,but they have always made me think, and expand as a human being(not to mention as a musician too!).
0385349947|5.0|I received my book quickly and excitedly began reading it. It was a great book. It's a quick read full of valuable gems of information. I'll be referencing it for some time to come.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ian Rankin, whom I have met twice, never disappoints. Truly a good read as are all his books. Rebus is always on mark!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This is a neat gift for fans of Minecraft and Lego! My 10 year old loves it. Although they are expensive, I may purchase another set for Christmas.
B006O5XYWG|1.0|The worst in the last 30 years. Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeed ....no good argument. Sometimes. The picture get. Out of clue. I mean. The. WORST!! GOD HELP ME.
B0064W65SO|4.0|This is a great story about how Batman began to gain experience as a crime fighter and I really liked that he made mistakes. This was such a good story that I was really disappointed it wasn't longer! That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5; I wanted more. Excellent read and if you love The Batman as much as I do you will enjoy this story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was bored with my usual reading material and decided to try something different.  On a whim, I ordered Wool and am extremely pleased that I did.  I am not much for reading any type of series as I tend to lose interest before I finish.  Right now, I am on the second book of the Silo Sago - Shift.  And I'm still interested!  That says alot - at least for me!  I think this would make a fantastic movie (assuming it hasn't already been done - I dont watch movies much!!)
B0064BWDRW|4.0|Another good Jo Nesbo thriller. Plenty of action and a good story line which brings Harry<br />Hole back home to investigate yet another crime.
B009CG3M1C|5.0|Great movie. No bad language.wish more movies would take the hint.bad languange dosent make a movie great acting dose. Great movie
B004W1GCNC|2.0|Weird movie. Just wasn't AT ALL what I like. I only watched a little bit though, so I didn't waste too much of my time.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, staying up past 2am on a Tuesday, I even told my boyfriend I couldn't hang out with him because I was worried about two Afghan women. Wonderfully written, thought provoking and leaves you with a renewed appreciation for the plight of refugees, their hardships and a lingering feeling of gratefulness.
B00867HDTA|5.0|my grandson and I try to out score eachother fun game  so far he is winning.  fun game for both young & old
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|I like apocalyptic movies, but Brad Pitt was not believable in his role as a regular dad and UN worker on a mission to save the world.  On the other hand, the zombies did a good job! That part was fun to watch and therefore gets two stars.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Other than for making money, I don't see why it was made.  In the Bourne trilogy, we saw a secret government program exposed and supposedly finally shut done.  This film shows that the original program is still alive and in fact is not the only program of its kind.  We see two more programs running at the same time.  The Renner character is in a second program that supposedly is faster and stronger than Bourne was.  There is third program which is used to attempt to take out the Renner character that is not only faster and stronger but without any emotion.  To top it off, there are additional programs out there to take over if these programs should also be shut down.  My question is why.  For a story, I thing the Bourne trilogy would have been enough.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Young Adult Fiction. A good read with an interesting plot but .....  not interesting enough to buy the 2nd book. Ange

B0036S4B6M|1.0|Slow moving, at every moment, I felt as though I could put the book down and never return to it. Was not 'hooked'
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It got a little boring at times (incredibly descriptive) but I gave it 5 stars for the storyline. I plan on reading more books by Rothfuss.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a fast read with superficial characters and contrived plot.  It was entertaining at times.  It may be better as a movie.<br />I haven't recommended it to anyone, and probably won't.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|I spent a lot of time researching good joysticks for PC games, and unless you've got the money to buy some of the $300+ this is your best bet. Everything has a good feel to it, especially the rubberized parts. Some of the plastic parts do feel a little cheap but I have never doubted the ruggedness of this joystick. Being able to fully adjust the angles and height of the joystick is so helpful for someone like me with huge hands. Every other joystick in this price range was either too small or didn't feel very comfortable (for my hand at least). Having the dual throttle control is also great if you're into flight sims or ARMA 2 and such games. The only problem i have had with this joystick is that the base can come up from the leg closest to you if you dont have a good angle from which to hold the joystick. It would be perfect if it had suction cups at the bottom to prevent this. Maybe I will just do that myself because there's no way i would return this joystick; it's absolutely wonderful!<br /><br />There's no better bang for your buck with this Joystick. Five Stars any day of the week!
0545405777|5.0|Loved this special edition, great product for its value. The sad thing is this is the first book, and couldnt find the others yet, hope they will publish soon.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Although the Amazon Kindle Silk browser does a superb job, in order to access Google's image library I obtained this browser.  Delivered immediately and works fine.  Very happy with it.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|Novels that keep your interest from cover to cover are rare.  Unlike a lot of writers he does not over use &#34;filler words&#34;.  Suspense held to the last.<br />Recommend this book to the adventurest of spirit<br />.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Really really cool you can almost do anything strategic in this game buy upgrade sell its awesome golden wings and money
B002YCVX5S|5.0|despite the parts that are sometimes a little rough for me - none of them in this movie - i look forward to seeing anything that Tarantino does.  i had seen the movie before, but decided to see it again.  and i'm sure i'll watch it again sometime within the next year or two.i<br /><br />if the only Tarantino movie you have seen is Reservoir Dogs and you didn't enjoy it, try another.  Inglourious Basterds would be a great candidate.  Listen closely.  that's a large part of the experience.  and if you really want to hear GREAT DIALOGUE watch Pulp Fiction (some of the rough parts noted earlier) but still well worth the experience.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book will not disappoint at all. I could've read it in 2 days but wanted to savor it. I wish it would've been released years ago...but glad it was.

B003M70O5O|5.0|Comes in great on the Kindle Fire, and I love not having to watch commercials.  Picture and sound are great!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Love that the workouts are challenging and only about thirty minutes.  Love that there are three circuits with three parts each, so you always know how much you have left before the end of the workout.  HATE that you can't fast forward through her little intro speech.  Only need to hear that once!  Wish it had one more workout like Ripped in 30.  Wish it had three strength moves per strength circuit instead of one long one (one minute) and one short one (30 seconds).  For these reasons, Ripped in 30 is the better choice overall, but I like owning both for variety.  These workouts really shaped my upper arms and back noticeably.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Great movie to see how dysfunctional behavior is generational & will continue until someone breaks the cycle. Good for family issues.

B008JFUP0I|3.0|What's that saying when The Rock is delivering a better acting experience than the rest of the cast? No joke, and he was a WWF wrestler. Vin Diesel's acting chops rival that of a tapeworm. And can't he find another piece of clothing other than wife-beater tees? They were hip back in the 90's but faded out. He's rockin those things in every movie, still, 15 years later. Paul Walker seemed like he was going through the motions but I do think he has talent. I guess after 6 sequels that happens. The action was pretty eye-popping though, but otherwise this was the same old action film. I did laugh at some of the ridiculous parts, Vin flying through the air like a damn hawk over the highway. I'm surprised he didn't wink at the camera. This guy can go away now, perhaps study the craft of acting rather than stand there like a water bottle saying macho lines. It's old dude, step up your game.
B00DGKQF2S|3.0|This album left me waiting for that BAM!To me it sounds like another Mr.Big with a far better drummer.Time for Billy to re-up with Roth and Vai!
B00371XIJE|5.0|If you love dogs, or just animals in general...check that, if you have any kind of heart...this film will leave you with a head full of congestion from crying or weeping or sobbing or all three. It's a first class, five hanky tear-jerker. Just think \\"Black Beauty.\\"  It's directed lovingly and skillfully and the performances are more than solid. But in the end, it's all about that dog. Based on a true story, the film made me want to wake my dogs up for a hug. And if you don't have a dog, it may make you want to rush out and get one. (If so, restrain yourself. Impulsiveness is never more dangerous -- or more consequential -- than when pet-shopping.) Enjoy this film and enjoy the cry.
B00CS7ZXFK|3.0|i know Mike is sitting on a complete/full set of this and will release it later as a &#34;Delux Edition&#34;.Everyone who knows anything about this tour knows they played 51-63 songs on their sets every night.So why are they missing?(see title above)Brian Wilson WAS - IS - And ALWAYS will be THE BEACH BOYS!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Although this version condenses a great deal of the story, the subtlety and emotion are clearly conveyed and the end result is a completely satisfying rendition. One of my favorite movies of recent years!
8866137480|5.0|Daughter wanted this planner for college so she got it and it is great.  Very nice and functional and pleasant and Moleskin has a lot of credibility as does snoopy.  So there you go.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|My favorite movies are the Star Treks.  I saw this movie in the theater and was blown away by the graphic and the story line.  Excellent movie.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|John Legend never ceases to amaze me.  His soft vocals and mind blowing song lyrics keeps him on top of the musical charts.  His music has depth and meaning that we can all relate too.  I applaud him for a job well done.  God Bless him and his new wife!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. The story line and special effects (I love special effects and graphics) were really good and the story line followed the fairy tale line well.

B005PK56TA|4.0|I am a horror fan of all different types of movies and scenarios. While some of the plot(s) were predictable, most had a turn that kept me guessing. Pretty creepy, make me remember why I hate basements.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|It is really good at guessing the following words, it learns really fast. I just trouble a little bit at the beggining getting used to it but after a little while everything was right. I tried another languajes and works pectectly as well. i just think it is better to type than writing by swifting.... but overall its fine
B00EU98VVC|5.0|Amazon Verified Purchase (What's this?) This review is from: Valkyrja (MP3 Music) Tyr continues to rock the mythical! 14 more words *required*? really. So, the other night I was at work when the most amazing thing happened. I was in the mens room and I heard this strange clicking noise. Imagine my surprise when a Velociraptor burst out of the stall and charged me! Luckily, a coworker and I had already developed a contingency plan for just this emergency. I sprinted to the cardboard baler and jumped in, lowering the masher to lock myself in. Hearing the agonized screams of my coworkers, I could only giggle insanely as I muttered, &#34;who has an overactive imagination now?! Who's laughing now?!&#34;
B00CXQL828|4.0|Good power trio! Good Rock sound! You can't go wrong with this CD. Richie has a great voice, and he smokes on the guitar!

The siren song of the calliope entices all with promises of youth regained and dreams fulfilled...as two boys trembling on the brink of manhood set out to explore the mysteries of the dark carnival's smoke, mazes and mirrors, they will also discover the true price of innermost wishes...The best Hallowe'n reading for the young ones and the adults!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Ok the best game ever is minecraft but this game gets second place.  It's really fun and I can spend hours on this game. The only thing I don't like about this game is that it's really hard to earn coins. But otherwise I LOVE this app. Buy it.
B001EC2IT4|4.0|In the day, this was leaps and bounds for combining horror and comedy!  One of Burton's best films. Can there be a sequel?

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn t put this book down! I loved the three main women of this story and how their lives were intertwined. thoughtful and thought provoking I found this novel to be much more than just romantic &#34;chick lit&#34;. We all keep secrets and we all wonder what might have been but this book takes that to the extreme yet in a very believable and sometimes frightening way.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Wonderful, touching story! Great book club read!!! Easy reading and great dialogue made for a fast paced book. Highly recommend it!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This app is a fun and challenging game that takes thought. Get the app while you can before the price is raised. Buy now!!!!!!!!
B00E9P959O|5.0|When this came out, I loved the focus of the writing. The lyrics could be spacey at times, but not so self-consciously tricky. But there was that clipping and unpleasant distortion.<br />My favs are Ghost Rider, Vapor Trails and Secret Touch. Clipping, particularly in the vocals, really marred the earlier version. I'm sure that there's plenty to quibble about in this one, but the remaster does a lot of good.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this and I found free books to read.  It's very easy to use and very easy to read.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This reminded me of a parable/fable that was totally fascinating, as well as being a bit unsettling. I went to a retreat once where we had to remove our watches and there were no clocks----we had to put our faith into the people taking care of us to ring a bell for meals and meetings. It took me more than 12 hrs. to stop looking at my watchless-arm....a true lesson in living on God's time, not MINE!! This book will leave you with a message---enjoy!
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|This album (originally), now CD, is the best Deep Purple music since &#34;Machine Head&#34;. How can you miss with adding Glen Hughes on Bass/Vocals (now with Black Country Communion), and David Cloverdale on Lead Vocals (now with WhiteSnake)? It is full of energy and great riffs by Ritchie Blackmore, great drumming by Ian Paice, and, of course, amazing keyboards by the late great Jon Lord. I highly recommend this CD to all Deep Purple Fans!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A great fan of DeMille I usually pour through his books with enthusiasm. This one...not so much. I'll still give it 4 stars. He is a master story teller and it did keep me engaged.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Keeps you entertained<br />Love this game. If you like puzzles you will definitely like this game. Time well spent on a lazy Sunday when the men and kids are watching football.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I loved this book. Rainbow Rowell has a way of bringing up real life situations in subtle and true ways. In Rowell's characters you can learn how to handle some of lifes hard situations.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Best game to play on your lunch break. It's challenging, yet not to hard that you can't beat it. You gotta give it a try!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|great app that allows you to create multiple alarms with custlom alerts. bed side clock with custom brightness is a plus. have to be a bit patient when pressing the buttons which I hope they change soon.
B005MMY534|4.0|...and much easier to follow than Game of Thrones, George R. Martin's convulated tale of criss-crossing kingdoms in peril.  Camelot provides a straight line story that's fun to watch-- a hero's journey, with a deliciously evil and beautiful Morgan, a young, naive and rough Arthur, and a round table of knights that are believable human beings, and who are so vital to helping Arthur rise to his rightful and predestined throne.  Add to this a deliciously real Merlin played by Fiennes, a man conflicted about his magical powers and appropriately mysterious, and an assorted host of characters to care about, from Arthur's mother to the smallest of children, all of whom are affected by the sway of power between Arthur Pendragon and his evil sister. On flaw is the character of Guinevere, who is ENTIRELY 21st century in appearance and attitude. She adds nothing to the plot, because she is totally unbelievable, even given the fact that this is a fantasy.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another fantastic voyage from Stephen. Thank you. In my mind I have already started casting the movie....hope it is made soon...Also another book about Abra and Doc would be great...A few of the True Knot did escape afterall...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have been struggling with this gadget for two days now. The instructions that came with the device is woefully inadequate and you almost need a degree in Computer Science to install/setup the thing. Also the size of the printing is ridiculously tiny. Why???<br /><br />I have found some instructions on the internet from other users that have struggled thru the installation process.<br />If they don't work I will be returning the celebrated Google Chromecast.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Another great show from England.  A superior mystery.  Great acting.  I recommend watching with subtitles on as the accents are broad.
B003Y5H542|4.0|This effort is cute.  All the voice actors do a great job; nobody takes their effort too seriously and the humor comes through.  I enjoyed this movie and have watched several times.

I didn't know much about this film but showed it during our Modern dance chapter and my students were very engaged and thought it was a weird but unique film. Film had wonderful modern dance sessions and I highly recommend it!
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|This is no-nonsense stuff...from a guy who tells it like it is.  As a marketer who travels (roams), and still works online, this has been pure inspiration.

1439102813|5.0|One if the best books written about personal account of Alzheimer's.  In this book, the woman narrates her journey discovering at 51 she has early onset disease.  But the symptoms are similar to anyone who has any form of dementia at any age.  An eye opener and easy read for care givers.  Highly recommend!
0385333846|4.0|This is an excellent anti-war story. First and foremost, it really makes you think. Think about war, the dead and, fate. The problem is not war, as it seems to the author it is there to happen from time to time, the problem how can we live with it and, minimize its impact. But, someone need to ask why was this 135,000 human lives killed in Dresden?<br /><br />sherif

B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This book offers a peek into the life of a person with OCD or other conditions.  The characters make you smile as they stick to their lives filled with  various functions and disfunctions.  I rarely laugh out loud at a book, but this one does make you titter.
B00DNDR29I|4.0|When Janelle Monae first hit my radar. I was immediately intrigued. Watching her growth over the last couple of years, especially her true-the-core tribute to The Jackson Five \\"I Want You Back\\" on award shows, I never fully drowned myself in her debut because there were a lot of tracks and it was the kind of album that demanded numerous listenings from start to finish. It is a perfect example of why allowing less disciplined fans pick and chose their favorite songs to download isn't always ideal. Some albums were created as a complete vision.<br />\\"Electric Lady\\" with its nearly 20 songs is again a thoroughly creative endeavor. It has interludes that intertwine between songs that while not essential, I figure over time to experience \\"Electric Lady\\", it will come with new awakenings. Again there are several different styles and genres of music. Immediately, the neo-soul mid tempo pseudo ballads strike a chord. \\"Can't Live Without Your Love\\", Dorothy Dandridge\\" and \\"What an Experience\\", all near the end of the album, are quite beautiful. The first single, \\"Q.U.E.E.N\\" and \\"Ghetto Woman\\" create a different feel.<br />While \\"The Arch Android Experience\\" didn't exactly set sales records, its wonderful to see how \\"Electric Lady\\" shows tremendous growth in several different international territories. La Monae seems to have cleverly avoided any sophomore jinx some three years after she first hit the scene. I and probably many more of her core fans are rooting for a Gold or even Platinum album. The lady creatively deserves it. Like Annie Lennox's \\"Diva\\", \\"Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band\\" and/or albums like Grace Jones' \\"Warm Leatherette\\", the concept album is in fine health.
B00C5R8364|4.0|I found this book to be a fascinating look at how international communities cooperate in order to fight terrorism and how complicated the logistics of these operations can be.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|EPIC! The entire season keeps you on edge, lived the suspense. I could have watched it all in one night !
B007THA4FI|1.0|I love JK Rowling. I did not like this book at all. I spent $20 on it at an airport bookstore because I forgot my Kindle and after struggling through the first few chapters, all I can say is I wish I could have that $20 back.<br />Her written descriptions of characters are well done, but the characters are unlikeable. Additionally, I found myself consistently confused about what was happening in each chapter. The book switches point of view from one character to the other for at least the first 140 pages (that was as far as I got). I enjoy reading for leisure and getting swept up in the world of the novel I am reading. That experience was not possible for me in this book as I was befuddled as which character's perspective I was reading.  I think that this novel was originally published under a pseudonym and sales tanked because it is not a good book, and then Rowling's name was accidentally-on-purpose leaked so that the book would sell.  I'm donating my copy to the local library and if you're really curious, wait until it shows up somewhere where you can read it for free. I wish I had.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|thanks for the product arrived in good condition and well packaged. my need is entirely satisfactory. The blue ray arrived intact without charge blows and the game instantly
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Ice Age Village is just as fun as the movie; the game costs way more than a movie ticket if you want to advance through the levels and expand your Village.  In-app purchase promises of additional percentages free come up empty.

This is one I will watch again.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great romance novel.  Anyone who loves a romance where the characters are flawed but still have the potential for an extraordinary life together by overcoming their weaknesses together, will be addicted to this book. Dialogues were fun to read, especially the witty flirty emails between Christian and Anastasia.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The adventure continues in the Outlander series. Although the constant challenges and  traumas seem quite contrived, the characters are fascinating and lovable. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.

6305041156|5.0|This is an excellent film, with an impressive scenario and extraordinary visual aspects. Below, more of my impressions with some SPOILERS.<br /><br />PRECISION: this is the review of double disc special edition DVD from 2006. I found the technical quality of image and sound satisfying - but as I don't own any other versions, I can not compare it with Blu-ray, etc. Therefore this is just a review of the film itself.<br /><br />In 1957 Kurosawa surprised and impressed the whole world with \\"Throne of Blood\\", an extraordinary adaptation of \\"Macbeth\\" transposed to feudal Japan. In 1985, for what was to be his last major film, he recidived, this time with \\"King Lear\\". But with the progress of technology this time he was able to produce not only a great tragedy but also a great show!<br /><br />The story is initially quite similar with that of \\"King Lear\\". The main character's name is Lord Hidetora, the head of clan Ichimonji. He is played by the great Japanese actor Tatsuya Nakadai. Hidetora was born as first son of a samurai lord who owned a little castle. From the age of 17 he fought many wars and he finally conquered a large domain, controlled by three powerful castles. But Hidetora is now aged 70 and he is weary of wars - therefore he decides to abdicate in favor if his oldest son, Taro Takatora Ichimonji.<br /><br />Taro will therefore become the leader of the clan and master of the First Castle. His younger brothers, Jiro Masatora Ichimonji and Saburo Naotora Ichimonji, will support him as masters respectively of Second and Third castles. Hidetora will keep 30 samurai as his escort and the honorific title of Great Lord - he will reside successively with his sons. Hidetora orders his sons to always remain united against all adversities. Two neigboring daimyos, Nobuhiro Fujimaki and Seiji Ayabe, are witnesses of this arrangement.<br /><br />But the youngest brother, Saburo, as well as one of main retainers, Tango Hirayama, both object and ask Hidetora to reconsider and stay in power. Enraged by the rude language and defiance of his son, the old leader banishes them both. That covers about 15 first minutes and from there the story really begins...<br /><br />It is hardly a spoiler to say that the story is a horrible tragedy - after all, it is a piece of Shakespeare transposed in the world of the samurai and directed by Kurosawa... But, unlike some \\"professional\\" critics, I absolutely don't consider this film as nihilistic! Withour revealing too much, I think that here the main message is the punishment for sins: the greater is the sin, the most terrifying is the punishment. And as we will quickly learn, old Hidetora and his vassals accumulated quite a lot of deadly sins in the last 50 years...<br /><br />The heavenly retribution against the Ichimonji clan will come mostly through the iron will and determination of an exceptional woman, Lady Kaede, played impressively by Mieko Harada... Indeed, it could be said in this case, \\"hell hath no fury as a woman wronged...\\" Many reviewers considered her character as \\"evil\\" and that certainly is one way to see the things - but what I saw was first and before anything else a woman hurt and harmed as cruelly as it is possible, who with patience, intelligence and absolute determination will avenge her loved ones by bringing ruin to all her enemies in such a comprehensive way, that they will not only be destroyed in this world but also damned in the next one! And honestly, once I realised all the evil crimes the Ichimonji clan perpetrated in 50 years, her revenge is also a case of justice served! In this point Kurosawa changed very significantly the whole sense of the story, because in the original Shakespeare piece King Lear is mostly an innocent wronged - well, here it is NOT the case...<br /><br />Two other impressive characters are Hidetora's fool, played by Japanese actor and dancer Peter and Shuri Kurogane, the most capable of Ichinoji clan retainers - a ruthless, brutal and cunning character, but not devoided of at least some human feelings. On the other hand, Saburo, the third son of Hidetora, who as equivalent of Cordelia character is supposedly \\"the good guy\\", well, notwithstanding his devotion to his father, I didn't care much for him, considering that by his sheer stupidity he kept making bad things worse...<br /><br />Another messages of this film are basically the repetition of some well known truths:<br /><br />- there is no fool as an old fool<br />- quem Deus vult perdere, dementat prius<br />- pride is the greatest and WORST of all deadly sins<br />- anger is a bad advisor<br />- most men can think only with what they have between legs - not with what they have inside their skulls...<br />- when you are on the run, RUN! Even if you are Bruce Willis, DON'T come back to your place for your dad's watch - because Vincent Vega will not stay in this toilet forever...<br />- when travelling through hostile lands with your soldiers, NEVER forget to send a vanguard, even if it is only one guy; it REALLY helps...<br /><br />The samurai battles in \\"Ran\\" are absolutely impressive, even if you should not expect too much realism about tactics - in many scenes there is a lot people running around absolutely nowhere and doing nothing useful. In fact Kurosawa used samurai armies as impressionists used colors and shapes - taken separately and looked upon closely the picture seems to be chaotic. Seen from a certain distance and as a whole, the effect is much, much more interesting.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is an excellent film, a masterpiece, providing both a matter for reflection and a feast for eyes. I loved it when I saw it in cinema long time ago and it was a delight to re-discover it again. To buy, watch and keep. Enjoy!acter, but not devoided of at least some human feelings.

B009NY43NY|5.0|I enjoyed reading, one of more favorite titles in the Sookie Set Yet.<br />Charlene is easily becoming a contender for my favorite authur for 2013.
1582701709|5.0|This is a book that should be read every day. The Secret is true life lessons and the message is not a secret at all. Living a positive life is a gift and learning to be open to the universe makes for a wonderful life... One of my top three books....
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Very topical and the subject of current events makes this book highly believable. Well researched and filled with faction - fact and fiction.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|got this until I figured out how to convert the file type.  Now I don't use kindle software, just convert it to formatted PDF and read it with aldiko.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|good adaptation of Dickens classic - Nefarious Frenchman got a bit old after a while, but what's a Dickens without a villain who won't die?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a page turner. Hard to put down once you start! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a mystery, love story, or a great book.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This book was a summer reading assignment for my school and even though I had to read it I really enjoyed it.  It makes one think about the perspective of a child with autism and the obstacles they have to face.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For some reason, my laptop when hooked up to my TV via a HDMI never got the picture to look right. With Chromecast, I can now watch Netflix on my TV!
0425263908|4.0|I heard about this book from a friend who also loved Fifty Shades of Grey. I think it's different enough that it made me want to keep reading. I really enjoyed it!
B0053TMP24|4.0|Very entertaining, I really enjoy the way the author writes. I have enjoyed all of his books. This one did catch me off guard once or twice which is good,overall a good read
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is a good size MB that fits well in my mid tower case. I have a Mid Tower Rosewill Redbone case that I use personally, and This MB fits in perfectly. I like the arrangement of the memory and graphics slots, and there is more than enough USB ports. Good bang for the buck.

B006S08RLU|5.0|Love this movie, it's so funny! I've watched it a few times already! Should definitely consider watching this one !
B005JE7XW0|5.0|This movie is silly and funny.  Everyone should give it a watch at least once.  Think Shaun of the Dead but less scary and more funny.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Top game of the world more than any game I have every thing on the game so very very fun
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This series manages to keep the tensions high as it moves along its ongoing saga of the fledgling firm facing takeovers and the threat of key employees jumping ship.  But it is the primary episode story lines with plenty of courtroom drama that keep me going.  The occasional appearance of Michael J. Fox is always a treat as is Eli's attorney defending him against election malpractices.  She is a hoot.  I love The Good Wife.  I hope it goes on and on!
B00EXVZZE8|4.0|I love this game. It's very fun and very addicting. The only reason I gave it four stars is because you can only double click when your flying, which is stupid to me. But other than that it's a great game.
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|As someone who owns at least 20 EJ records, I was delighted with \\"The Diving Board\\" from the opening track, \\"Oceans Away\\". Elton is aging gracefully and Bernie's writing still shows no signs of falling off. T-Bone Burnett doesn't fuss a lot with the sound that has made Elton great since Gus Dudgeon was at the helm. Great choice as a producer. I find it hard to believe that a real EJ fan would not be happy with this record.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|A necessary book for all education stakeholders (parents, students, teachers, administrators, and policymakers) to read. Paul tough isn't afraid of telling the truth about why the current education model is failing.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|This movie was really entertaining. I received it very quickly and was able to watch it within a few days of ordering it. Thank you for the great purchase.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Nice to have a story with an unpredictable ending.  Great wrap up sequence.  Great synergy between the leading characters.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
B001EOOQEC|3.0|This would be a 5/5 star rating, but the CD case was damaged upon opening the package. I collect albums of all my favorite artists, and this being damaged meant I had to get a new case for this. Otherwise phenomenal and no complaints, still very good buy and recommended.
B00DW39B2K|2.0|KILLING SEASON will likely make you cringe for two reasons: #1: John Travolta's ludicrous Serbian accent (why didn't they just cast a real European?) and #2: the sight of two old Hollywood actors literally poking holes into one another.<br /><br />To see Travolta and DeNiro in an action film becomes painful to watch partly because there's an inherent weakness to the treatment & execution PLUS the fact that they're being paid a lot of money to do this.  The show should have been titled Who's Torturing Who as the two men take turns kicking each other about and doing truly nasty things that are no doubt designed to shock the audience (Ooh!).<br /><br />While the filmmakers may have had noble intentions with the violent setups, it is difficult to enjoy the film which veers between bad accents and B-movie setups.  This despite a poignant ending scene by DeNiro that underscores the message of the story.  The film actually has a decent conclusion, but by that time, we're exhausted in watching Travolta and DeNiro rolling around in their sandbox for 90 minutes - and relieved when the end comes.<br /><br />So while the film has some minor highlights, the overall experience probably isn't worth it, unless you're pining for a DeNiro fix or want to see Travolta return to his pre-Pulp Fiction acting form.<br /><br />Bring back Rambo I say.  Seriously!<br /><br />PS - The film only made $ 30,000 just about at the US box office - an amount which probably didn't even cover the catering for a day.

0783225733|1.0|I think they screwed up the formulation in the DVD pressing so that as it aged, it became unreadable. I tried buying a DVD replacement as well as a blu-ray one, because i love this movie and wanted to watch it on my non-blu-ray laptop while I'm on the road. Alas, the replacement also would not read. No sign that the focus motor is even finding the disk. Avoid.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|It's good, but very easy scratchable. I'd like  they were more resistant. Even if used for an adult or big boy
B005FFW46S|5.0|I love the adventures of Sam Vimes, and this was another great one. In general, you can't go wrong for fluffy lighthearted fantasy with a Terry Prachett novel, and he just keeps getting better and better.

B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I'm an Americana fan, an old time devotee of CSNY and the singer-songwriter genre.  This album is right up my alley, solid writing, singing, and some solid guitar work tastefully woven in.  At times Mayer's compositions echo John Prine, perhaps Ray Lamontagne, even a touch of Creedence.  This is carefully and thoughtfully done music.  If this is his new direction, I'm along for the ride.

B006AZZPCM|3.0|I got this app because I can't depend on SILK. My daughter has Tubemate and swears by it. It downloads really well if you don't get a blank page. Maybe I just don't understand how it works, but at least I don't get &#34;Download Unsuccessful&#34; on almost Everything like I do with SILK. I can't wait to get something that actually works!!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love this game. I play it about everyday. I love moving the cards around with my finger. Great game to play while waiting at appointments.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It didn't even have the slow spots that most movies do !! The love story was sweet and the action surprising. I also really enjoyed the music. They were spot on with the actors that played in this film. Leonardo Dicaprio was a 5 star success in my book !!! Go see it or rent it !!! You will really enjoy it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The game is fun and exciting. They just need to not have the bingo zoom to the so quickly making it hard to press the balls. I  would say that the gap in between ball calling in the New Yorkgame is a little slow. It also takes so long for the line to move you the next bonus(like keys, ball) and I think it also takes to long to get to the next level when playing in the New York room.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|DUMB, dumb, dumb...  I was really looking forward to watching this since I thought it would be funny.  The story was predictable and the use of profanity was over the top.  I am not a prude but It felt like they thought swearing more would make it funny- not so much..  dont waste your money- not funny
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down.I loved how all of the characters were somehow related to one another.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|This movie has always been a classic.  I watched it repeated times before I had my daughter.  Then when she became older, I got her to watch it and she loved it.  So I bought it for her.  She still loves it!
1455527475|5.0|Wow, I just finished reading this book by Greg Smith.  In fact, I listened to the unabridged version - read by Mr. Smith himself.<br />Very impactful and leaves you with a lot to think about:<br /><br />Primarily, what I took away were impressions about the obvious contrasts between what's right and what's wrong as reflected by Wall Street's community, and Goldman Sachs in particular.<br />About what is ethical practice that benefits all, versus accepted practices that benefit the very few.<br /><br />About what direction one's moral compass is pointing in and about how following the true principles of one's upbringing - both culturally and religiously (in Greg's case, he is an observant but not seriously religious Jewish guy) - can lead one to have to make a choice between bending ethics for direct personal gain and conscientiously choosing a morally correct path that has positive outcomes for everyone involved.<br /><br />Basically, morals exist for a reason in the civilized world - sure, you can ignore them and cast them aside, but what are the consequences and at what point do you separate the \\"good\\" from the \\"bad\\" and how do you characterize trust?  This book tells a great story of a young man's rise in a powerful and magnetic company only to be deeply troubled by the corruptible practices that take hold in a company he once believed so ferociously in.<br /><br />Greg Smith wrote an excellent book that spends 75% of its content praising Goldman - a place he spent his entire working life.  He was on a clear upward projectary within the firm.  But he found just couldn't justify practices he observed in the current version of the company that increasingly overshadowed the original standards that used to define Goldman.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book  - a must read in these times of financial cowboy-isms and uncertainty.<br />I hope that Greg goes on to a stellar career - perhaps in politics?<br />I learned a lot - so will you.

B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Once again, the writers have kept the plot moving with enough &#34;good guy/bad guy&#34; to make it interesting.  Some great ancillary characters and a well intentioned jab at our rather &#34;stupid&#34; federal governments programs....
0811879542|5.0|Very, very creative.  Simple yet complex.  A young girl recommended this book to me.  I purchased it, read it, and passed it along to a little boy.  It is the kind of book you want to share.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The only movie I had not seen was &#34;Rocky Balboa&#34; so I got to watch the entire collection from the start.  Okay, the best way to describe &#34;Rocky&#34; is just that &#34;A ROCK&#34;, he can't be beaten down, he bleeds, he emotes, he has lots of scars....but he won't go down or stay down.....I love it!

B004L86718|1.0|This movie was irritatingly boring and weird. First of all, Tom Cruise's character is way too cocky, it makes me want to punch him. Also, Renee Zellweger and him have absolutely no chemistry so there's zero chance to can really believe they should be together by the end. It was just so lame, extremely slow, and way too long. I was forced to buy this movie and I have never regret a purchase more in my life.

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This is an amazing record. Some of Trent's most interesting sonic textures ever.  The song &#34;Everything&#34; is a bit of a surprise-I think it's the first NIN song ever in the major scale.  The packaging is beautiful and reminiscent of The Downward Spiral, as it was done by the same artist. Yes, this record is different from any other NIN album; it shows Trent's growth as a person and as a song writer.  I can't recommend the record highly enough.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Very well done show, their takes on the various characters are both interesting and good fits for their versions in the original stories. Good acting rounds out a fun show.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I...just...all the feelings.<br /><br />When I first heard about this book I was so excited for it, it sounded like an excellent story and I couldn't wait to get my pre-order in the mail. Then I started reading reviews and seeing people rave over the book on twitter and I got anxious. See, a lot of times when a book has crazy hype and everyone loves it, I end up not really caring for the book. I don't like not liking everyone's favorite thing, but it's just usually how it works. John Green has such a passionate and devoted following and I didn't want to let anyone down by not liking the book. So when I got it in the mail, I promptly put it on my shelf and went about reading every other book first. Then one night I was feeling brave and decided I was finally going to give it a go. I should also tell you that I am actually a ghost while writing this, because I am dead. This book absolutely killed me, but the good kind of killed (there is a good kind, I swear).<br /><br />I don't even know if I can really review this book, because every time I think about it all that comes to mind is WOW, what, what what?, *sob*, *swoon*, etc. I fully expected a book about a girl with cancer to make me feel things, because that is what stories about dying people do, but I never expected the level of emotion that this story evoked. And not just sad emotions, there was plenty of humor, happiness, and anger thrown into the mix. I'm pretty sure Augustus Waters is one of my favorite people (real or fictional) of all time. That boy is just so cool. Also, sweet and completely adorable. For a while I wished that the book was written from his point of view, but ultimately I really liked seeing him through Hazel's eyes. The best scenes were when the two of them were together, alone or with other people, bantering back and forth. I loved their personalities when they got together and they both had a wicked sense of humor.<br /><br />After finishing the last couple of pages, I reread them, then just stared at the book for a little while. I was so completely blown away and so grateful that I finally took the chance on this amazing story. This is definitely one for the reread pile and now I have the extremely hard task of choosing which John Green book to follow this one up with. I have this sneaking suspicion that no other character is going to live up to Augustus, but I guess that's alright by me
B00FEN1C50|2.0|Lousy sound when I hooked the laptop to the tv with hdmi. Also, no subtitles as an option. Considering this was my first experience using this amazon feature, and I had to pay $15 for this subpar download, I probably won't purchase again. Otherwise, the movie itself is badass.

B00EDPFJA4|4.0|Drake has arrived, and there's no doubt that he knows it.<br /><br />Nothing Was the Same is the first CD of his to truly embrace his fame; to do what he said he wouldn't do back in the Thank Me Later days(\\"No matter where I'm headed, I promise to stay the same\\") and to become, really, a new person. Whether Drake is aware of the contradiction isn't clear, but he devotes a big portion of Nothing was the Same to showing you that he isn't perfect; that he makes bad choices, that he's broken hearts as he's went, that he's let his money get the better of him, etc. This is his first album where he doesn't even attempt to appear likable. In fact, it feels like he wants you to think the opposite of him.<br /><br />It's for sure an interesting listen; there aren't a lot of rappers who let you into their emotional states of mind and get truly personal and introspective in their music (though Kendrick Lamar may have ultimately taken this crown last year with Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City) and Nothing Was the Same brings back the moody, atmospheric, piano-driven sound from Take Care to some very cool results.<br /><br />If you thought his previous album featured a little too much singing, Nothing was the Same sees the pendulum swing a bit more back in the direction of rapping, which is definitely a good thing. The album opens (perfectly) with Tuscan Leather, a 6-minute long track featuring 3 verses of straight up rap with no chorus. It's exactly how I expected Drake to open this album and I wasn't disappointed. If I have to praise him for something here, it's his flow; the way he raps over these beats is nothing short of incredible, and it's in his flow that you see a true step up from his past albums. Lyrically, he hasn't grown quite as much; he's still rapping primarily about girls, his fame, and money. But he's still as solid as ever, and this CD does a great job at demonstrating his (definite) skill.<br /><br />The first half of it or so is awesome. Tuscan Leather's an epic rap intro. Wu-Tang Forever has a very cool verse surrounded by a great piano tune and strong production. Hold On We're Going Home, and (especially) Furthest Thing are two of Drake's strongest singing songs, (Own It isn't bad either) while From Time oozes with atmosphere, featuring 2 excellent verses over an elegant piano and vocals by Jhene Aiko. The second half of the CD (despite some issues, which I'll get to) has the incredible Too Much, along with Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2, closing the CD out on a perfect note.<br /><br />So though I thoroughly dug much of this album, there are also unfortunately several tracks that I think take away from the CD and even demonstrate some laziness. No longer struggling to prove himself and to make it big, I can't help but feel that at times Drake on here seems almost like he's half-trying. Not all the time, and definitely not for most of it. But there are songs on Nothing Was the Same that are so repetitive that I almost always find myself skipping them, something I almost never did with Take Care. Started From the Bottom, of course, was the hip hop hit of the summer (for reasons I still don't get) and it hasn't grown on me at all here. But it's the perfect example of what I'm talking about, with two short barely-verses surrounded by an endlessly repeated catchphrase. He wants us to root for him in this song and to celebrate his rise to the top, but it's hard to do that when the only examples of \\"the bottom\\" that he gives in the song are the fact that he shared a car with his uncle and drove it in traffic.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not someone who thinks he's a fake. I know that he and his mom struggled to make ends meet, that acting on a Canadian TV show was not the same thing as being a Hollywood star. But the song does such a bad job of demonstrating this that it comes across as completely shallow and doesn't say much of anything. Worst Behavior has an awesome verse, but first you have to sit through over two minutesof him not rapping, but shouting the same 6 words over and over and over again at you. It makes the song almost un-listenable for me. 305 To My City has a *very* cool sound to it, but Drake's overuse of the word \\"Get it\\" (which is said in the song no less than 60 times) again nearly ruins it.<br /><br />Others aren't as bad but I still find myself skipping them. Connect is a filler R&B song without much to it and some lazy rhyming (he rhymes \\"weekend\\" with \\"weekend\\" then \\"creeping\\" with \\"creeping\\") while The Language sounds like a generic club beat with a forced vocal chorus that barely seems to fit in with the timing of the song. That said, his rapping in this track is decent, despite some more occasionally lazy rhymes (\\"platinum\\" with \\"platinum\\") but he raps in that \\"Versace\\" style that I can't tell if I like or hate.<br /><br />So in a way, Nothing Was the Same is hard to review. It features some of Drake's best work, along with some of what I think is his laziest. It has a great sound and captures a definite mood, but all in all I think Take Care (though it featured 2 R&B songs too many) is the stronger album. Nothing Was the Same has better rapping and faster-paced R&B songs, and it makes some excellent work of guest vocalists (on From Time and Too Much) but it also has several tracks that I just can't for the life of me get into, and they drag the listening experience down for me.<br /><br />I guess part of it is that I'm a fan of Drake's music and think he's incredibly talented. Nothing Was the Same demonstrates that talent, and fans and non-fans alike I think should definitely give it a listen. But there are aspects of it that I hope aren't a sign of what's to come for Drake's future work.<br /><br />(Note; should you spring for the Deluxe Edition, it includes two bonus tracks, neither of which I think are particularly great. That the Deluxe CD technically ends with All Me also means that Big Sean, not Drake, gets the last word on his own CD. A bit of a weird choice.)
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Good book although I miss a lot of the characters from previous books. I look forward to read &#34;A dance with dragons&#34; in order to reach the story's climax. Let's hope the good ones will eventually defeat all the bad ones Cersei especially.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this on both my Kindle Fire and my smart phone. Since l have used this on different smart phone brands it won't do you any good to know which. The point is this thing is amazing. It lets me know when it needs space, then just cleans it so fast. I get an avg. of 300 mgb. a day clean on my Kindle, and around 100 mgb. off of my phone. I would easily pay for an app like this, but this one is.free, even better!

B004HWYTP4|5.0|It is well written clever and has wonderful actors!  I've never seen a movie with better casting.  It terrific to see a movie with all the major roles went to people 50 - 70.  They played their roles great.  Helen Mirren shows 68 can still be athletic, on the ball and sexy as all heck!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is the best show out there.  It had humor, solidarity, and all aspects of it were very interesting.  Season 1 definitely made me want to watch Season 2 and then of course I had to watch Season 3.  Can't wait for the rest of Season 3.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|fun game, but i'd rather pay a few dollars up front than get hit with premium content all the time
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I think that it could load quicker ya know? I love it all bit it could just load faster. k cool.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  I have been watching the series since it started and it just keeps getting better.  I am looking forward to the start of the ninth season and where they are going to take the story line from here.
B00E32MUEA|5.0|This is my 4th purchase of this book.<br />I loan the book and never get it back.<br />Must be worthwhile.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Streisand at her very best. The entire cast is fantastic. If you love her and Mandy don't miss this film.
B00847KFDS|2.0|The cd skips when played.  I have a new vehicle and I do not think it is the player as it does not happen with other cd's.
0143124544|5.0|The book takes place in England, two lives of very different people are brought together and create a story that will stay with you long after the book is finished!!!<br />The book has sadness, but is wrought so well.  You will NOT be disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I can't get it to open for the books on my current Kindle, therefore I can't read from my phone.
1401937519|3.0|Many spiritual journeys retold, whilst reassuring and comforting to know there is a state to return to...this was interesting but did not resonate with me as others have......
B005HEFB6M|5.0|True to the Roddenberry tradition......this is a wonderful prequel  to the original series and I'm very impressed with the acting
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It is ok once in a,while.  Anyone who enjoys playing Bingo would like this.  Will play occasionally but not a regular part of my day.
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|If you first got into Rod Stewart during this golden age of his music, then you will absolutely love this. Some of this material is also on the Sessions Box set but not all of it. The price is worth his version of &#34;Every time we say goodbye&#34; on it's own.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Have on laptop and like playing.  Can be challenging.  Anyone who likes playing this type of game.  Will play sometimes but not a regular player.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|I had to get this since I have every album he has ever released, but it is OK. Not great, just ok.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I use it primarily to stream Spotify to my TV from Google Chrome and it works great. I've also tried it with the Netflix Android App and streaming web videos from Google Chrome to my TV and both work flawlessly.<br /><br />Maybe the users that have found issues streaming from the browser have issues with their wireless connections. I didn't have any issues streaming web pages to my TV.<br /><br />The installation is the easiest installation I've seen for a wireless device.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I purchased this because it seemed like a fun mindless way to kill time whenever I am waiting but don't have the time to get into a book. Turns out it worked better for keeping my daughter occupied when we are out. If she starts getting antsy I can turn on my Kindle and pull up this game and it is able to keep her quite until we are done with appointments.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|nice hidden object game. in game purchases are for idiots.  just stop playing for awhile and read a book. ^_^
B00ALGW286|5.0|Moscow Dreams is a superb novel that genuinely captures the sights, sounds and feel of its unique setting. The reader can truthfully emphasise with 14-year old Marina as she unwittingly becomes a first-hand witness to impactful historic political and economic shifts in her society. 'Perestroika' is the common buzzword used to describe the ordered chaos. The changes that Marina witnesses not only demand a national shift in the country's economic priorities, but forces profound cultural adjustments as well - posing precarious challenges to Russia's national identity.<br />Marina comes of age during the fragmenting transition of her country from a communist superpower to a newly established independent capitalist state. The reader is transported seamlessly back to that historic period. Marina is illustrated beautifully with all her personality quirks, and her intimate hopes and dreams of visiting the world outside the confines of the `Iron Curtain,' - and her awkward discovery of true love in the process. She struggles to adjust to a fast changing environment with her three High School friends Nadia, Stanislav and Nikolai. She finds a helpful emotional bridge between the past she has grown to miss, and the future she hopes to create, through Babushka - her doting grandmother.<br />Moscow Dreams is a wonderful novel for fiction readers and history buffs alike. Author Julia Gousseva offers the reader great insight into Russian customs and traditions during the Soviet era. She also displays a tremendous knowledge of historic events leading up to the birth of the Russian Federation. The reader gets to experience many of those world shaping events at a deeply intimate level. This is especially exciting for Western readers like me, who actually bore second-hand witness to many of the novel's descriptive scenes of the August 1991 Coupe as they played out live via CNN news feeds.<br />I value this book for its descriptive writing style; its believable human characters and itshistorical accuracy. Moscow Dreams was a very engaging read! 5-Stars!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Totally entertaining as always and so well acted. Lots of diversity on everyone's part as both universes are fully featured.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I didn't grow up watching Little Women and I had never read the book.  As an adult, I read it for a book club and was so happy that I did.  The book is way better than the movie; you see how the characters develop and strive to be good and finally succeed to overcome a vice that has plagued them.  The romances also take more time to develop, which makes them more enjoyable as they unfold.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Sound City by Dave Grohl is a  documentary that gives a heart beat to the music created and recorded at Sound City recording studio during its hay day of the 70's and 80's. The unique sound produced at Sound City is credited to the one of a kind sound board, the Neve. A complicated but beautiful board that made magic with the music of artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young, Rick Springfield, Nirvana, Johnny Cash, and so many more.  The film underlines the arduous work and talent, both behind the mic and behind the Neve board, to create songs with a lush, rich, deep tone that is unmatched to any other before or since.
B00A3Z3KDG|5.0|Although I haven't ever really cared for DiCaprio's acting, all of the other acting was very good in my opinion and I thoroughly enjoy a relative (African) happy ending.
B00AW57L96|4.0|Wonderful Australian novel with characters from any family on your street. A mystery solved, a dilemma revealed, a resolution reached. Absorbing reading.Thoroughly enjoyable
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I can't wait for the next year to become available!  I tend to watch each year like I read a book, start to finish.  Fabulous themes and acting!
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Extremely funny!  All the characters are great actors the kids on the show are amazing will continue to watch to
B006S053K8|5.0|While not as \\"laugh-out-loud\\" funny as \\"Superbad\\", this movie was a subtler comedy, where most of the funny moments come from the interactions of the characters rather than outlandish situations.  Set in the late 80's, Eisenberg plays the main character, a recent college graduate working at Adventureland to raise funds to attend Columbia graduate school.  Viewers in their young 20's will find this premise crazy, because these days there's no way anyone could fund their education (especially at Columbia) with a summertime carnival gig, but those thoughts faded into the background as the awkward but sweet chemistry between Eisenberg's James and Kristen Stewart's Em emerges.<br /><br />Aside from the romantic backstory, other characters are given a chance to shine--including Bill Hader as the nerdy, penny-pinching boss, Margarita Levieva as Lisa P., Adventureland's hot girl-next-door, and Ryan Reynolds as Connell, a womanizing married man.<br /><br />Overall, it was a less climactic movie than some of the films it will inevitably be compared to, but what it lacks in outrageousness it makes up for in relatable characters and an ending (not spoiled here) that will make even the most stoic movie watcher smile.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I downloaded this app to help my husband sleep better! Unfortunately it didn't help him. but everyone is different it may work for someone else!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to pinterest! The app works amazingly,I never have any problems with it and it never fails me. Keep up the good work!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Mind blowing. I knew non-organic food wasn't as healthy but I didn't know just how bad it really was. More ppl should watch this
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is absolutely Amazing I can't wait to see the movie I love  love love  love this whole series
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|No offense but the writer should have read it one more time before submitting it... really. It doesn't make much sense. I like fiction, witchcraft, zombies, horror, scify... you name it. This one the characters are unreal.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|As always this season has a very intriguing story line. Fantastic characters! Beyond Sam and Dean, Castiel and Crowley are among my favorites.
0375869026|5.0|My 10 year old loved this book, she finished it very quick because the book kept her very interested to hear what was going to happen to Wonder next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it's super addicting.there are all kinds of new challenges and new things to earn.I love it so much! would recommend it to everyone,but you have to have quick thinking and even quicker fingers!
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Is a little long and ironically a little rushed, lots of content with several smaller stories.  That said it's really good and in my opinion quite a bit better than the second one.
B00DY951TO|1.0|This review is from: Another Self Portrait (1969-1971): The Bootleg Series Vol. 10 (Vinyl)<br />This is such a potential collectible item, but instead I paid $79 for something that arrived damaged with a crack in the slipcase edging. Two weeks later I got a $50 Emmett Gowin book - SAME THING - DAMAGED with big dents on the hardcover of the book - also a potential valuable addition to my photo book collection [but not with dents in the cover] that has appreciated over the years. CAN'T YOU SHIP ANYTHING(!!!) TO ARRIVE IN BRAND NEW CONDITION.<br />Amazon also makes contact about these kind of problems too cumbersome - try to find a phone number to get a response from someone as quickly as the disappointment of opening damaged items.<br />Amazon is starting to give up quality for their own speed and volume of sales. I am extremely disappointed. Also, the Another Self-Portrait took sooooooo long to arrive, you would think it is not 2013, but some previous decade of slow delivery, because that the way it was. It is not that way now, so get with some speed in your delivery process.<br />- VERY DISAPPOINTED.
B009JZWO3I|3.0|If I hadn't been able to watch all the seasons for free through Amazon Prime I wouldn't have stayed with this. Each episode follows the same format and there are few surprises but I became curious about the characters and found myself watching one episode after the other. Now that I've caught up and it's on network TV or viewing through HULU, I'm not so keen on watching because I hate commercial interruptions. The most interesting character is Kalinda and the most irritating in Ely Gold. I found the legal issues interesting and I'm hoping that they were close enough to real cases to be educational but with TV one never knows.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If your a Stephen King fan this is as good as it gets. I would suggest you re-read The Shining (you HAVE read The Shining haven't you?) prior to reading this but this novel can stand on its own.
B006TZBGBW|5.0|Complete Judas Priest fix.. Awesome box set. Every Halford album with priest recorded plus a lot of bonus tracks some live some unreleased
B001XUH69Y|5.0|How can anyone with emotions and appreciation of irony every complain about Casablanca.  Sure, the story is contrived and hokey, but the acting and the classic lines surpass any criticism.  I could watch it every month and never be disappointed.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This was a good scifi flick.  Not quite your average Tom Cruise action movie with a little touch of vanilla sky for good measure
B007THA4FI|5.0|It's not Harry potter but I did not expect it to be. What a great plot very entertaining, hard to predict. You want to cry, cheer and shout and root for the underdog. Can't wait to read the next book.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|Geared more toward a teen love story instead of drama.  Most adults that are into intense sci-fi won't like it.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Hirsi Ali does everything perfectly in writing this book.  She brings the reader from her early childhood to her twenties during which time she lived and believed as a Muslim.  She then experiences an eventual turn away from that faith and life - neither easy nor painless.  Fascinating and a must read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Makes you think without frustrating you haha. You should definitely try it out. Can't wait for more levels
B00009R86L|5.0|The pad helps a lot especially when you carry a heavy load. It decreases shoulder pain and also it never slips on your shoulder. Its a good accessory for you shoulder bag. I always get shoulder pain after i shoot a wedding. But thanks to the Domke shoulder pad, shoulder pain no more!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The series concerns the law and lawyers, highlighting the various shades of grey that live between the stark black and white of written law. It explores what lawyers on both sides (defense and prosecution)  will do to win  It is appropriately set in Cook County.
B00821PCJS|5.0|LOVE this show. The story line is great and the twists are even better. This show gets addicting and I finished the first season pretty quickly!
0307352153|5.0|Don't underestimate the power of introverts, this book can change your life for the better; it changed mine! i hope you like it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|best movie out. I love all the actions and funny parts I will look at this again and again!!! A most see!!!
B0036G1T78|5.0|Movie has lots of unsuspecting turns. Good suspense and drama. Makes me wonder about our CIA friends. Robert Redford and Max von Sydow are especially great.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is pretty fun app. Not challenging but fun for kids and I took take care of a pretend pet.  I do not like that you have to use really money to buy gems to complete tasks. So a lot of tasks go uncompleted.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The quality of this show continues at a high level.  There are ups and downs for all members of the cast.  Just like what we see in daily life, people can be incredibly kind and caring at times and then get absorbed in bitterness and revenge at others.
0307454568|5.0|Great price on a book that was in very good condition. I wanted to read all three of the books in this series and did not wish to pay full price at the bookstore.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed by Ann Leckie's story writing.  Despite some obvious foreshadowing, the book consistently held my interest as I pushed through and read it over a weekend.  The setting of Radch, the curiously mannered conquerors whose empire is unravelling, unbeknownst to them, is well realized. I loved the slow revelation of the central mystery, which contained enough twists to keep me guessing.  I thought the conceit of the sentient ship and its attendant ancillaries was well done and thought Leckie handled the gradual humanization of the AI very effectively.  Ms. Leckie deals subtley with questions of consciousness and humanity but never bangs the reader over the head with heavy handed messages. Almost the characters are ambiguous (sometimes inscrutable) in their motivations, in the way real people are and have been throughout history.  I was thrilled to see that two sequels are planned and eagerly await more thoughtful adventures of Breq.
B000Y5JFNY|1.0|hi still not recd the sound of music gift set yet :-( any help would be appreciated.<br />raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
B008JFUOVI|4.0|I didn't expect to enjoy THE HANGOVER PART III.  The first film rocked me out of my socks; it was a sucker-punch to the gut in a world or predictably tame non-Judd Apatow comedy, featuring a cast of relative unknowns partaking in hard-R shenanigans.  Then PART II came out...and it was the exact same thing.  The exact. Same. Thing.  Not in a good way.  So I had low expectations for the third.<br /><br />Perhaps that plays in a role in why I enjoyed it so much.  You have to know what to expect; series rarely get better as they pan out.  Still, Todd Philips and company do something very interesting in PART III: they divert from their tried-and-true method.  Oh, we still have our three best friends on a wild goose chase, with perennial luckless schmuck Doug MIA.  But this time, the story comes with a unique twist: instead of trying to find Doug, the guys are trying to find their friend/nemesis Chow, thanks to a brutal drug dealer (John Goodman doing his spot-on thug thang).  This creates more of a heist comedy (a dark one, too; it's still hard-R), and injects a small dose of unpredictability into the mix.<br /><br />The cast is still strong.  Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zack Galifianakis (who was kind of cloying in PART II; too much of a good thing, perhaps) hold the fort.  As Chow, Ken Jeong is surprisingly enjoyable.  In the first film, he was great, since his role was small; in the second, his part felt like a contrived rehash of better days.  Here, despite his more prominent role, Chow is surprisingly not annoying (well, not too much so), and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is great.  Throw in a great Melissa McCarthy cameo, and you've got the makings of a funny, funny film.  Suffice it to say, HANGOVER PART III isn't quite on the same level as the first...but it's a far cry from the laughless depravity of the second, and is sure to delight fans who are hoping the series will end on a strong (or at least not thoroughly disappointing) note.  Now let's just hope they don't come back and make PART IV.  (Although, if you throw DUE DATE into the mix, then this one technically is PART IV...but I digress.)hope they don't come back and make PART IV.  (Although, if you throw DUE DATE into the mix, then this one technically is PART IV...but I digress.)
B004PYDBVM|5.0|An amazing personal journey - it is emotionally challenging to read the injustice of the story but it is a privilege to have the opportunity. Makes you want to jump in to help with the Underground Railroad! This is one if those books you'll be up half the night reading. I found myself taking the bus to work so I could read on the bus :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Maybe not quite as good as The Hunting Games, book 1 of the trilogy, but still engrossing to the last moment of the book, but then the 1st book was so completely unique.  I'm ready for the finale now.<br />S2k
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I have had problems with knee pain and plantar fasciitis for many years. This book is easy to read and gives some alternative approaches and explanations for these problems. I found it to be a very enjoyable read.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Great product, it just talks by itself, I find it a little hard to write a review on this. Unless you get one that is not working for some reason, then I guess I'd have a lot to say.

B005MMZ63C|5.0|Orson Wells at his best.  This movie can be watched over and<br />over and you still see more.  I say CLASSIC.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER.. I highly recommend this book. It keeps you hooked and you don't wanna put it down.. love it
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this story from the first sentence to the last sentence. Kline subtly weaves the two stories together until they seem to be one. I suspected who Vivian was for awhile, but knew for sure when certain items were found. Very entertaining and thought provoking.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moVUJ3LPX17I9]]\\"The Stranger\\" is told in first person-style from the character of Meursault, who is a murderer.  It is divided into two parts with part one being everything that leads up to a murder and part two being everything that happens after the murder.  This book is written in a very spicy writing style and revolves around the humanization of the modern psychopath.<br /><br />Basically, the character of Meursault is missing the ability to connect on an emotional level with anything around him and this is what \\"does him in.\\"  He can't fully express his feelings because he doesn't really have that many feelings to start with.  In this story, the author gradually massages the psychopathic elements of Meursault slowly into the narrative so you won't judge it too quickly. What the author is able to do is to show how easy it is for society to label somebody as a psychopath and lock him into jail, and that nothing is ever black and white.  There is always a gray area.<br /><br />The most intriguing part about this book is the discussion about free will and mankind's ability to adapt to any circumstance given enough time.  Meursault goes from being a free man to being locked in solitary confinement, and so the story challenges you to think about what that kind of lifestyle would do to the human soul.  What would it take for you mentally to be able to survive?<br /><br />All in all, the book deserves 5 stars because it does make you think and you probably will read it again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is such an amazing series, but I grew so fond of Matthew that I hated the way things turned out.  I wish we didn't have to wait all the way until JANUARY 2014 to see what will happen next!! ARGG...
B00006FI51|1.0|I Did not receive service that I expected.  Did not play on my dvd. Not Compatible with my dvd player.
B00F35BV64|4.0|This movie is a wild ride with a couple of red herrings here and there to throw you off the scent but with enough clues so you can possibly figure out a few of the twists and turns. There were many, many little Easter Eggs of knowing nods to the past iterations of various Star Trek TV series and movies and much like the original series, throws in some parallels with our current events and struggles of how to balance bringing wrong doers to justice without treading on basic human (or non human) rights as the blood-lust of revenge can be our undoing and end up being less justice and more tyranny. Overall I think you would have to say this is probably either the best or 2nd best theatrical release of the series depending on how you feel about the Wrath Of Khan but as great as it is, I still really, really want to see the writing team bring in my favorite character from the original series, Jim Kirk's &#34;..own personal devil.&#34; as he referred to him, his Star Fleet Academy nemesis, Finnegan, the Irish upperclassman who tortured a young &#34;plebe' Kirk in the original timeline.  Watching someone get under Kirk's skin would be fun to watch and good comic relief but when his inevitable comeuppance is doled out it could also be a good way to bring in the current topic of bullying, cyber and otherwise.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Very entertaining and funny movie. Great visual quality. Great plot. The whole movie was a delight to enjoy. I'd recommend it to everyone.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|It is probably the best thing to happen to the Kindle since color. Allows you to browse the same as if you were on the website, yet it is quick and compact. You also can download and save the pages for offline browsing, or archiving(Great for pages that change often)!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Wow!  I am not normally a Tom Cruise fan, but I was amazed by his acting in this one.  Subtle, surprising, even charming.  And, can I just say, he looks so good for his age!!  He's my dad's age, but he looks great. So, anyway, movie.  I love sci-fi stuff like this, and was surprised by a couple plot twists.  The soundtrack is incredible and visually it's just a treat to watch.  I will buy this movie (and the soundtrack) and plan on enjoying it quite often.  I think it would be over the head of kids, but quite clean (just one scene to skip to keep it completely kid friendly).  Definitely try it out - I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This is THE youtube app to have for your Kindle Fire HD! The download function is something that needs improvement, and the crashing on daily view needs correcting.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun for all age. Works offline. No crazy adds. Simple good fun. Great movie like game. And it simple for kids.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|This is the best EJ album in years. If only the radio was like in the 70s or the 80s. The album would have been on the charts forever. The songs are beutiful.
1476727651|5.0|Very easy to read and become interested. Captures you right from the start.  Can't wait to finish and start on another.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|As a type-A son of type-B American parents, this book really moved me. As a kid, I was literally put out to pasture to do anything I liked, or nothing at all. I enjoyed collecting bugs and catching fish, but... something was missing. I'll spare the mushy emotional details and just say this was one of those books that I pirated as a PDF, then liked so much I felt the need to pay for a legitimate copy.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really enjoyed the books. I listened to the audio book and read them too. The story is pretty romantic. I have to recognized that the second time around the repetitive words where a bit much, but it was still captivating. I definitively fall in love with Christian, who would not? He is young, successful, good looking and romantic. I was expecting more sadomasochistic, dominatrix details but at the end I was satisfied with the books. It is not the most original story of the world but it is worth reading.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|Product exactly as described. Thanks! Speedy delivery - Wonderful service.<br />The movie has become an instant classic.  Beautiful production in all aspects.  Holds its own with the stage play - which I have also seen.
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|Good concept, ruined by poor execution.  Lighting!  Does the house not have lights or light switches?!  The complete darkness of the setting gives me no fear other than he might trip on something or stub his toe.  No ambience at all.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I went in to the movie not expecting a whole lot, knowing that it deviated from one of my favorite zombie books. I was entertained the whole time though. Maybe it was Brad's awesome acting or the fact that the zombies ran 4 minute miles, either way I would watch this again.
B005VPRG10|5.0|What more is there to say its Star Wars in Lego form<br /><br />It's a great size and has a nice weight to it great display piece
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is great. It keep you on the edge of your seat. It keep you entertain. The only thing I do not like is I have to keep paying for every six restaurants
B005544V6A|5.0|The actors on SUITS are soooooo cool...and who doesn't want to identify with that?  These are the beautiful people in a field that does  have the best reputation so it's fun to be in their world for an evening.  The writing is sharp and you need to be even sharper to appreciate the ironies and underlying sub plots.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is very simple to learn. It only takes a few minutes to catch on. It's a very good game for when you're waiting at the doctor or just bored.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell into this book by chance and simply loved it. I laughed, cried, and enjoyed every page of the book.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Good old movies.<br />Will start watching more of these.<br />Our teenager also did enjoy in spite of been oldies.<br />DVD in excellent condition.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Tom Cruise delivers an outstanding and exciting movie about the maintenance of the machines after the world total destruction.  Scenes of famous landmarks in the US shows what the world has become without people.  Movie keeps you entertained, with many interesting and unusual aspects occurring during the course of the movie.  It is a very interesting movie ending; dealing with the extremely limited remaining mankind, and the power of the human mind and its ever-lasting spirit.
B002HNA95E|5.0|very good album love it madonna is great i listen to it and its fun yay words ya. I play this music frequently and does it bring back memories. She has always been a great artist and dancer.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Boring.....Too many characters....Convoluted and hard to follow! Plot was missing and srung out.....I'll stick to nonfiction from now on...Wasn't my type of story..
B000I5X81A|5.0|We recently lost J.J. Cale.  Most people have no idea of the number and greatness of the songs he wrote. Putting Cale and Capton together made for a great CD.  One of the best to me.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I'm having a lot of fun with these puzzles and they're a nice way to relax. The reason I gave the app 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had to figure out to use the back arrow on my Kindle when it looks like nothing is happening with the game, and also because it will randomly take me to ads in the middle of the puzzle. A little inconvenient, but hey, the game is free.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|*SOME SPOILERS*<br /><br />Something that's nowhere near as common in the book world as it is in the movie world is the sequel. As much as I loved The Shining, it never occurred to me to even WANT a sequel to it. The first book, from what I remember, wrapped up fairly well albeit bittersweet. Danny and his mother escape, the Overlook blows up, and that's that.<br /><br />However, when I started to read Doctor Sleep it made me ask myself why WOULDN'T I be interested in a sequel? What happens to Danny Torrance and his mom after such a colossal nightmare? Would he still have nightmares? Would he still be visited by the spirits in the Overlook? Most importantly...what kind of adult would Danny turn out to be?<br /><br />The answers are all there. Yes, Danny is still visited and haunted by the spirits. His \\"gift\\" is indeed a curse. And yes, adult Dan Torrance became an out of control alcoholic just like his father, without the descent into insanity. But all along, I found myself rooting for him.<br /><br />Without giving much else away, I think this is Mr. King's best work in years. He terrifies me the way he did when I first started reading him and he has crafted a story that is more than just horror. This is about courage, love, forgiveness, and the chance for redemption. Well done!<br />[[ASIN:B007H9DKSG Hymns to the Alchemists]]
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The concept of this novel was wonderful and will give readers something to think about, OUR ACTION AND CHOICES DO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  However to me it was like a romance novel which is not my favorite read but again the under lying theme was good.

B008JFUO36|1.0|I thought this movie would be pretty good considering it starred Tom Cruise. Throughout the movie I kept waiting for it to get started and for things to start happening and for well...action. Unfortunately the movie droned on for just over 2 hours with the last 10 minutes being the best out of the entire movie. Could have been made in either half the time or could have just been made better period.

B00EE3FTNM|5.0|As a long-time Doctor Who fan, as well as British TV in general, this is a Doctor Who fan's dream. Tons of people (both sides of the camera) from both Doctor Who and Torchwood come together and create a new world together. It's not distracting that you know all of these people from David Tennant on down. These are some of the best actors/actresses working today coming together to create an 8-part homicide mystery that has some similarities to Twin Peaks, but manages to be completely unique and original. The writing, directing, acting, music, cinematography are all top notch. It's like watch a movie it's that good (and do yourself a favor and make sure to watch it streaming on Amazon and in HD so you get the full visual quality and not editing/commercials).

B003K15IF8|2.0|The first few pages were interesting for the slice of early 20th century rural life that it conveyed. Williams portrait of campus life during that era was equally engaging.The writing was rich and easy to appreciate. But the sour and destructive personalities that he developed as he told the story were too much for me. You'll like this book if you have a taste for dark and miserable people or can ignore that for the richness of his writing. If neither applies to you, find another book to read.

1451626096|4.0|\\"The White Princess\\" is about the extraordinary life of England's Elizabeth of York, known as Elizabeth the Good. This woman who was Wife to Henry VII daughter to Edward IV and mother to Henry VIII was always near the seat of power but never ruled the nation, herself; although many thought she had more of a right to the throne than Henry Tudor. Instead she served as a valuable asset to her husband due to her extreme popularity with the people and as an adviser behind the scenes. In many ways she was the Princess Diana of her day. Her charm, beauty and likability helped to greatly strengthen Henry Tudor's grasp on the throne during a time when England was still divided, following the War of the Roses, and Henry, who had killed Elizabeth's lover Richard III on the battlefield, was viewed as a usurper. This intriguing novel is filled with action, excitement and Elizabeth of York proves to be a much more sympathetic heroine than the depiction of her mother Elizabeth Woodville in \\"The White Queen\\". Gregory has done an impressive job of presenting these historic figures as complex and multidimensional. She has also succeeded at creating vividly detailed descriptions which capture the reader's imagination. This is one of Gregory's most compelling novels to date.<br /><br />Jennifer Leigh Wells<br />Author of \\"Rebecca: The Making of a Hollywood Classic\\"

1611761840|4.0|Meet Matilda, a bona-fide child prodigy.  Matilda could speak very clearly at an unusually early age and naturally began to read much sooner than most children.  Her parents never noticed, however.  Mr. Wormwood is always too busy finding new ways to trick people into buying the lemons at his used car dealership, and Mrs. Wormwood spends most of her time watching television and doting on Matilda's older brother.  In fact, if you asked Matilda's parents, they would probably tell you that Matilda was quite slow and dull-witted.  They would be quite surprised indeed to learn that Matilda had been walking herself to the library every day since the age of 4 and had read almost every book there, her favorite author being Charles Dickens.  When Matilda was finally old enough to go to school, it didn't take her teacher, Miss Honey, very long to discover what an exceptional child Matilda was.  Here was a tiny little girl who could read and understand books that would give many adults headaches, and who could multiply large numbers in her head with astonishing speed.<br /><br />There was one small problem, however - Mrs. Trunchbull, the school's headmistress.  Mrs. Trunchbull hated children and it just so happened that she had recently bought a car from Matilda's father.  That was bad initially because it gave Mr. Wormwood the opportunity to tell Mrs. Trunchbull what a troublemaker Matilda was, and it was even worse later on when Mrs. Trunchbull discovered what a lousy car Mr. Wormwood had sold her.  So things started off rather poorly for Matilda and went downhill from there.  But even little girls can take only so much, and after several weeks of watching Mrs. Trunchbull abuse her friends, Matilda's pent-up frustration finally comes out in a most unexpected way.<br /><br />I couldn't help but notice how Matilda's relationship with her parents was very much like the relationship between Harry Potter and his aunt and uncle.  Vernon and Petunia Dursley hated Harry and were always giving him the short end of the stick in everything, all the while doting on their fat, spoiled son Dudley.  It was the same for Matilda: her parents never really liked her because she was always reading books instead of watching TV and other odd behavior like that.  They doted on their son, however, who was every bit as dishonest as Mr. Wormwood, and who would someday inherit his father's used car lot.  It was not a happy upbringing for Matilda but it is, of course, pivotal to the story, and perhaps something that some children can relate to.  Roald Dahl has an uncanny knack for reaching out to younger readers.  Whether it's a boy winning his very own chocolate factory or a girl with the power to overcome a mean schoolteacher, Dahl's stories are the stuff daydreams are made of.<br /><br />I feel that I should mention one possible trouble spot for parents.  During the course of the story, Miss Honey tells Matilda about her own childhood.  This is not a pleasant tale and involves a parent who dies under suspicious circumstances and a great deal of mental and physical abuse from Miss Honey's stepmother.  It was really kind of disturbing.  If you plan to read or listen to Matilda with your children, be prepared for some discussion afterward.<br /><br />Narrator Kate Winslet proved to be a very pleasant surprise.  In fact I found her narration to be every bit as charming as the story itself.  Winslet does a wide variety of voices for the different characters in Matilda and I found them all to be perfectly appropriate and downright amusing at times.  I especially enjoyed Kate's voice for little Matilda, which was just plain adorable.  If you're an adult I think you will appreciate the talent at work here, and you're children will enjoy the funny voices just like the ones in their favorite cartoons.  Ms. Winslet has appeared in many, many films, most notably 1997's Titanic, as well as lending her voice to 2006's Flushed Away animated movie.  She will be starring as Jeanine Matthews in next year's release of Divergent.anine Matthews in next year's release of Divergent.

B008JFUQZ2|3.0|I must admit that most of the fun for me was forcing my g.f. to come watch this with me, as its such a \\"guys\\" movie as she would call it. Sadly this film to me was almost like watching a half completed film. The special effects were awesome, however the dialog seemed ripped off from a old Voltron cartoon and was extremely cheesy and pedantic. Any decent science fiction fan could of probably wrote better dialog and that lack of polish made the film fall flat. I'm not expecting Shakespeare when I go to see a science fiction movie but when your dialog make the dialog to \\"Transformers\\" look interesting, there is a problem. An A for special effects, an E for the klutzy scrip.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|I like this movie now more than I did as a kid. The humor in it is just great. My 5 year old just watched this for the first time recently and now she is hooked on it. She loves it!

B00FGM0IEU|4.0|There's not enough room here for listing all the good things about this documentary. Percy performing &#34;When a Man Loves a Woman&#34; just about sums it up. As normal with the entertainment business. Life starts out good, peaks, then goes kaput. The writers politely skip over the hard feelings when the band left Rick and started their own recording studio nearby. It was his idea, hard work, foresight, love of music that got it all started. His own creation shut him out. Wonder where &#34;Non-Competes&#34; came from. Bringing in Ms Keys seemed more like a commercial. NOT part of the documentary. That should have been omitted. Where was any mention of Tom Dowd? Saw him in the background. But, never heard his name. Documentary?

B00D2I8E28|3.0|Just about every review on this site is from someone that is a huge Elvis Costello fan but is new to The Roots.  I'm coming from the opposite perspective. I've been a fan of The Roots for at least a dozen years now and all I know of Elvis is &#34;Pump it Up&#34; and &#34;Allison.&#34;  I have a pretty eclectic taste in music, as I am as much a fan of Bob Dylan, Marilyn Manson and George Strait as I am The Roots.  That being said, I just can't get down with Elvis Costello.  The first track I heard on this album was &#34;Walk Us Uptown&#34; and I thought &#34;Wow, this album is going to be spectacular!&#34;  Then I listened to the other tracks.  Elvis' voice grates on my nerves.  Yes, I'm a Bob Dylan fan saying this.  Normally I hate auto-tone but I might have to make an exception for this guy.  Some of the slower songs like Tripwire and the title track just make me want to fall asleep.<br /><br />The Roots have lost several components throughout the years like Malik B, Scratch, and Leonard Hubbard to name a few.  They've persevered and continued to put out incredible music.  The core of Black Thought & ?uestlove have been the one constant.  The absence of Black Thought on this album though pretty much disqualifies this as a Roots album in my opinion.  While there are a handful of good tracks, I can't give this album anything higher than 3 stars.

B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|This is garbage, 2/3 of the movie is about the kids being in boot camp, then there is about 20 minutes of action, then 5 minutes of credits, then 10 minutes of interviews. I couldn't wait for them to get out of boot camp, it was so uninteresting,the dialogue was apparently written by a 12 year old, which seems to be the case in most movies like this. The 20 minutes of action is the only good thing about this movie. Really, if you cans just watch that bit, as for the rest of the movie, put some rotten fruit on the patio and watch the ants get drunk, it will be more fun. This is a very slow version of Starship Troopers.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I mostly listened to this on audible.com, but downloaded the Kindle edition to read it using WhisperSync. A very good read, but as a sequel to The Shining it was simply interesting. The Shining terrified me back in the 70's when I read it. The True Knots just seemed too cartoonish to be frightening. I'd recommend it to those who read The Shining and wonder what ever became of Danny Torrance, but not necessarily as a stand alone book.

B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Rhonda Byrne's book \\"The Secret\\" (2007) was the first time I remember reading about the law of attraction. That book was published at a very opportune time for me--at a really tough point in my life when I faced some HUGE decisions--and I became a huge devotee. I put the law of attraction into practice and brought into my life not only clarity about those decisions but success and happiness upon making them and going forward with a new chapter of my life.<br /><br />I think of Pam Grout's E-Squared as the \\"how to\\" that I was left wanting when I read The Secret. Pam doesn't just say \\"Here's this really cool concept you should know about.\\" She says \\"Here's this cool concept and I'm going to show you EXACTLY how to make it work in your life.\\" In other words, I see The Secret as the synopsis and E-Squared as the term paper.<br /><br />Just because E-Squared is the \\"how to\\" doesn't mean it is a big book or a sloggy read. It is, in fact, VERY easy reading and is only 157 pages (I read the Kindle edition). I kind of wish it was just a little bit longer! Further, E-Squared is a bargain at only $2.99 (Kindle).<br /><br />The author uses a lot of real examples of people she knows who used the law of attraction to change their lives and circumstances in both large and small ways. She gives you nine experiments to put the law of attraction into use. Most can be done within 48 hours so they are very manageable.<br /><br />I have not yet been able to put many of Pam's experiments to use because I was on an airplane flying across the country when I was reading most of it. I did, however, have something interesting happen at the hotel when I was about to fly out (I'd started the book the night before). I'd just been given a pair of beautiful earrings a day or two before I left for vacation; they were EXACTLY the kind of earrings I like and very hard to find. I wore them on the drive to the hotel where I'd be leaving my car while I was gone. When I got into my hotel room, I noticed that one earring was missing. I set the intention to find this earring before my car had to go to the long-term lot for me to fly out. I looked around the hotel room--nothing. Front desk where I'd just checked in--same. Finally, I went to search the car. I looked on the floorboards, between the seats, everywhere that my earrings usually drop when they fall off (yes, this is a sadly all-too-common occurrence). No earring. I was heart-broken. I had just made the conscious decision to give up and started to pull my head out of the car...and there it was. My earring!<br /><br />I have one other experiment going on right now and do want to try the others; but, frankly, even if I never try the experiments, I have gained so much clarity on this process that the book is more than worth it for that alone. Ms. Grout has renewed my passion for this subject and reminded me to keep it in practice always.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you too enjoyed The Secret. If The Secret left you wanting more details, this is the book for you. If, on the other hand, you think the law of attraction is total poppycock, there is no point in reading this book (then again, maybe it's just the book to change your mind!).<br /><br />4 1/2 starsthat one earring was missing.

B00ELE8D4Q|4.0|This album as a whole is alright but not fantastic. Many of the dance tunes in the first half of the album sound like what we've heard over the last 10-15 years and mostly her sound in that has not evolved much since \\"Believe.\\" That's not to say they're bad, they're quite listenable just not very interesting. This is coming from a fan of dance music throughout that time period as well as a fan of Cher since the late 80's.  Of the dance tunes \\"Dressed To Kill\\" is of a slightly higher quality, with \\"Red\\" being the best of the first half of the album.<br /><br /> I Walk Alone is actually a good song to put right in the middle, it's a bit lower tempo than the first six songs but still obviously a dance song. It bridges the two parts of the album perfectly and it is one of the stronger tracks on the album.<br /><br />The second half is the ballads, with some rock styled power ballads and some more stripped away ones as well. Some of these work better than others. The standout tracks are \\"I Hope You Find It\\" and what is the gem of the album, and possibly the crowning jewel of Cher's entire career, \\"Sirens\\". I get chills every time I hear the latter song. Normally I'd say that I hope it goes on to be a single, but with much of popular radio being what it is today, radio doesn't deserve to have \\"Sirens\\" released to it, because today's intended market wouldn't understand it anyways. I cannot gush about how wonderful a song it is. I would have given this album a three star rating,  given half the album is just okay, but \\"Sirens\\" gave it that extra star on its own. Okay,  I'll stop gushing now.<br /><br />So to sum up, not bad, but about half of it is somewhat disposable, with five standout tracks, one of which is just amazing.

B00915G6SU|5.0|I own and thoroughly enjoy Seasons 1-7 of Criminal Minds.  I re-watch episodes routinely.  When it became available, I ordered The Eighth Season hoping that I would not be disappointed in the new character, Alex Blake, or the quality of the new plots.  I found that the Alex Blake character worked well in conjunction with the established characters.  The plots were well-written and interesting -- though some plots were a bit unusual.  I don't watch TV, so I had not seen a single episode of the 8th season.  My style is to order a new season, and have a marathon when the package arrives in the mail -- watching about one complete disc at a sitting.  I read the summaries in advance, and, sometimes, skip to an episode that has a continuing theme. I am glad that I purchased Criminal Minds, The Eighth Season.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys well-written, well-acted crime-dramas.  The productions are top-quality.

But the premise and format are hard to sustain for a book as long as this and at the halfway point I was tired of the amount of time spent in each of the sister's heads with their chatty asides, endless self-doubts, second-guessing, and their silly phone texts to each other.<br /><br />The two sisters also speak to the reader in virtually the same \\"voice.\\" Although Fliss seems a bit more mature and her love interest is the most notable of all the male characters, the similarity with her sister as regards the constant inner voice drags down the action. Both characters are endlessly speaking to themselves with little pep talks, pages of self-examination, and mental analysis of all the other characters, too.<br /><br />The interruptions of Lottie's honeymoon, engineered by Fliss, are a bit too graphic, and eventually just come across as goofy. Needless to say, all the interruptions succeed and Lottie finally comes to her senses on her own. Thankfully, the ending works out all the kinks in the story.<br /><br />I'm a strong fan but unfortunately this was not Kinsella's best.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I don't normally read books in this genre and I must admit I was a little intimidated by it, but I'm so glad I decided to read this one! I'll admit the beginning of the book is a little slow because it's very character driven so there is a lot of time spent developing the characters. About halfway through the book it really starts to pick up and the last 1/3 of the book was epic!<br /><br />There are a lot of twists with the characters and stories so you may feel one way about a character or situation then by the end of the book you feel completely different. There are many unexpected situations that keep you interested in reading it. I remember my jaw dropping several times which generally doesn't happen with me.<br /><br />One slightly negative aspect, sometimes the characters get confusing. Sometimes the same character is referred to by different names or you may forget who a character is when they show up again. I had to re-read a couple parts to get the characters straight.<br /><br />In the end don't be intimidated, read it and stick with it and I promise you will be rewarded!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|J.R.R. Tolkien? George R.R. Martin? Seriously? This is a very poorly written book. Bad metaphors, bad character development, world building for the sake of world building without any really. The story is simplistic and dull. That said, I did wind up reading a few other books in the series. Every so often I need to read a good train wreck.
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|Very cute app. Lots of little games to go through. I love all the panda games. They are very entertaining.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|i learnt a lot from this book. i highly recommended book for entrepreneurs who are just starting out. it is an enjoyable read.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|My Son love loves it, does everything he needs it too! He does his work on this item and it is very happy with it.
030789701X|5.0|Not too much different from the paper back one but it is very useful and looks great definitely worth the buy if ur a hardcore fan cuz in stores this book retails for 50 bucks that literally the price of a new game
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It was a very interesting read about a man I knew nothing about. The author made it a pleasant, informative read.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|It's always a huge gamble when they try to reinvent an iconic story line. Most of the time, it seems to come out badly. But I think this 'reboot' was very well done, and Kudos to the actors. They really pulled it off and made me re-experience falling in love of the original series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love it. I am not disappointed. I can't wait to read book three. It just keeps getting better and better.
140006922X|4.0|I liked the book, very interesting, how the historical Jesus and faith are different, also he has done it in a very sensitive and well researched way.  Truly enjoyed the book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun and Easy, I would tell all my friends and family to down load this game and play till you can't play anymore!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great! Difficult to put down as the secret is not revealed until the end.  I will be reading more from this author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG, I love all of these books. I am just sad the story stopped. It is a really good story.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|The game is pretty fun.  However, it's really repetitive and there really isnt much incentive to keep playing.  I got a good few weeks out of this
B007FEZQF8|4.0|This book was good, but some parts werent like from the amc series, but still really liked it.<br />Best zombie comic book made in my opinion
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|Language Errors:<br />1.She consistently has Laurent mixing the two languages in a fashion that sounds more like an American who knows a little French than like a Frenchman who knows a little English. He says the complex things in English and then throws in some French words that he would certainly know in English if he had just spoken the rest of the sentence in English.<br />2.No one should scatter French phrases through a book without a much better knowledge of French. Here's just one example:  on Page 118 (Location 1947), she has Laurent say, \\"Je compris.\\" It should be, \\"Je comprends.\\" That's an error that no Frenchman could possibly make, and even an American with 2 years of high school French shouldn't make. It's an error that would leave a Frenchman rolling in the aisles over American stupidity!<br />3.On Page 196, Location 3268, she has Laurent refer to Maggie as an American male rather than an American female, \\"You think you can go on and being the single girl, n'est-ce pas? Ach! You are so am&eacute;ricain...\\" It should be, \\". . . americaine.\\"<br />4.On Page 297, there are a number of French language errors that can perhaps be excused since they are spoken by Maggie who admittedly does not know French well. \\"Je me regret\\" is neither grammatically correct nor an accepted way of saying, \\"I'm sorry.\\" \\"Je regrette\\" or \\"Je regrette d'avoir fait quelque chose,\\" or \\"Je suis desol&eacute;,\\" all work. Who knows what \\"Je m'excuse\\" means? She could have said, \\"Je m'excuse d'etre en retard,\\" or \\"Veuillez m'excuser d'etre en retard,\\" or \\"Je vous prie de m'excuser d'etre en retard.\\"<br /><br />Plot Errors:<br />1.Who would even consider accepting a child as a niece she had never seen from people she didn't know and then taking her illegally out of the country with faked papers?<br />2.Who thinks they can diagnose a child with autism after knowing her only a few days in a country where she's never been and doesn't speak the language? To be able to diagnose Nichole as having autism after knowing her for only a few days is truly miraculous. She should quit writing mystery books and share this astounding ability with doctors and specialists in special needs.<br />3.On Page 263, Michele Zouk ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon. Such an order by a French person would be highly unlikely. She may have ordered a Bordeaux from a particular wine area in Bordeaux, such as a Haut-M&eacute;doc, that was made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, but she would not have ordered it that way as we do in the United States. It is even more likely that she would have named a particular vineyard in the Haut-M&eacute;doc region such as a Château La Tour Carnet.<br /><br />Format Errors:  Left and right justified text changes abruptly to centered text and then back again on Page 252 indicating a really sloppy proofreading job.fter knowing her for only a few days is truly miraculous.

B00E95ED32|4.0|I bought True because of only one song Lay Me Down. It has a disco vibe and others are either country, folk or can't determine what genre. I hope Avicii decides to go ahead and release LMD as a single.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|LOVE this movie!! it tugged at your heart strings but also gave just enough action to keep you interested. I like a good blended movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game one of the best I've played. Only problem it freezes sometime and doesn't remuberse your bingo chips.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I loved this movie because of the action and it had a good story line.  All the iron man movies were great.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|It is a daily-life story giving an immersed experience, not without surprise as well, which I appreciate. The narration is in a humorous language which I think characteristic of the English way. The book is worth downloading and reading, although there are sentences i consider as misgrammared as well as spelling mistakes.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Remember those albums like \\"Cryptic Writtings\\", \\"Risk\\" and \\"The World Needs A Hero\\"? For me, I had fun with those three albums, even when Dave slowed down a little bit (or a huge bit!) On \\"The System Has Failed\\" they were getting back to business, while \\"Endgame\\" and \\"Th1rdt3n\\" sounded 'back in those days' when there was \\"So Far So Good So What\\" and \\"Peace Sells but Who's Buying\\". Well, they just slowed down again, and that's still cool! It's just way to easy for Mustaine to slow down then get harder again, while another band (yes, the counterpart band) was too way difficult to get back to their sound.<br />Dave Mustaine is a smart guy. Period.
B00C2UUPQA|4.0|Very clever methods used to escape.  It's too bad Roger didn't have better judgement when it came to leading his flight in its first attack of the war.  The timing of his last escape was also unfortunate.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Cant wait for Season Three - It is the kind of series that is great to watch through and not wait for a week to see the next show
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Unique tale on your traditional platformer game.  I found it lots of fun to play. My kids enjoyed it too.
B008G3N71W|5.0|Like a lot of people, I don't have much experience with erotica. It's sexy, it's fun, but in the hustle of the day, I neglect the sensual and sexy side of my imagination. When presented with the book, I jumped to read it. This book is a good way to restart one's libidinous engines and get back into thinking sexy.<br />The story is straight-forward and fast paced. A young actress riding the subway exchanges steamy looks with a fellow commuter. Conversation gets right to the point. How many times have we as readers exchanged similar looks with strangers, but didn't have nerve to speak?<br />Our actress does what few dare, becomes intimate with the man, and enters his world of dominance. Her world explodes into sex. Encounters with more commuters result in covert sex. She indulges her roommate, her boss at her job, random strangers, in encounters ranging from ice cream to light humiliation.<br />All the time, the commuter leads her deeper into sensual discovery, a competition with his brother, fetishes of all kinds, and a climactic pony race.<br />Descriptions of dresses, food, scenery, characters are vivid, but do not bog down the bogging-down (is that a thing? Should be.)<br />So: lots of spanking with canes, fellatio, fingers in places, and urine on faces.<br />I'm getting Chloe's \\"A Girl's Trade\\" next.<br />I read this as part of an exchange of reviews on Amazon. But I did indeed enjoy it. Chloe had fun writing it, and that made it a fun read.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|I accidentally stumbled onto this on a Disney channel, and laughed myself silly through it. I could tell that there were deleted scenes in the on-air version, so I bought the DVD to enjoy the entire movie.<br /><br />I'm still surprised at all the actors they got for this. So many roles for people who have been a part of previous superhero movies and TV shows. Such as Lynda Carter of Wonder Woman, Kurt Russell of Snake Plissken, Bruce Campbell from Evil Dead, and Cloris Leachman of Young Frankenstein.<br /><br />It didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed the scenes I didn't get to see before. The ensemble cast worked together great. Great special effects, as well. One of the DVD extras is showing how they did some of the stunts, and wow. The kids were really brave to try some of it! I'm not sure I would have.<br /><br />I read later that the kid's contracts had a part saying that they would do a Disney series if Disney decided to produce it. Sadly, that never happened. I, for one, would have liked to see what they would have done with the series with all the kids in this. Some of whom have gone on to quite a few adult juicy roles, showing they had, and still have, plenty of acting chops.<br /><br />This is a movie I definitely recommend for plain good fun!<br /><br />(Writer of this review is not in any way related to Ron Wilson, Bus Driver. Hehee)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The time depicted of WWI and the build up to WWII makes a compelling historical background for this classic drama of tradition versus change.
B007I6GCT2|5.0|I am a purist when it comes to my Star Trek stuff, and at first wasn't thrilled with the idea of placing young actors in established TV roles, but this so freakin works!!! These guys are spot on and absolutely wonderful. The 3 disc edition is a blast with all the 'extras' and that is why I paid a few bucks extra to get it from a secondary seller via Amazon (it is OOP). I LOVE this movie and the second Into Darkness only whets the appetite for a third, fourth and more movies with this cast!
B00025ETIW|5.0|Its a great album by them and I've heard a lot of songs from it since there are some songs that were more &#34;out there&#34; than others and got more exposure but I'm so glad I have the whole album to listen to now.
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|After a 5+ year hiatus Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails are back with with a new album. Most of the songs are gritty,dark electronic based songs with a few guitar driven songs sprinkled through out.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Easily still one of my favorite bands. I've been following them since middle school back when Limewire was big but finally holding their albums is great and I've been able to listen to the songs that I've never heard. I enjoy them whole fully.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is a great book for kids funny can't wait till the next diary of a wimpy kid I highly recommend this funny book
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Love this movie. Dustan Hoffman does a brilliant job in the title role. It's a classic story done very well.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|VERY ADDICTIVE. JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT, YOU FIND OUT YOU DON'T! FUN GAME!<br />SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR MORE HINTS!
B004FWXKXS|5.0|This is a Very good movie. Great performances by Hopkins and Baldwin. Keeps you on the edge of your seat
B008XG1X18|3.0|its ok. it crashes a lot and I have to delete the app then reinstal it. other then the crashing it is pretty good for the most part
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This series has a Great plot, great action. It's Right up there with SG-1!<br />I would recommend it to anyone.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Concise writing prompts list-making. It's the secret weapon of many fine writers, including Elizabeth Gilbert. Lists transformed into short sentences quickly advance a story's action and can relate back-story at the speed of light.<br /><br />Gilbert's skillful use of this \\"list to literature\\" technique keeps her sprawling story from getting bogged down along the way. Not convinced? Read the first two chapters of her new novel and think about how much time and distance her character, Henry, covers in 40 pages. Still not convinced?<br />I have three words for you: Eat, Pray, Love.<br /><br />After reading Barbara Kingsolver's review in The New York Times Book Review, I knew I would read this book. (Disclaimer: I never read Eat, Pray, Love.)<br /><br />I'd planned to buy the Kindle edition of Gilbert's book. That was before I went to the bookstore and held a copy of the hardback in my hands; flipped it open and saw the beautiful endpapers; sneaked a peek under the dust jacket and touched the simple but lovely design on the cover. I was smitten. No way I wasn't going home with this book in my hands.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved the way the author &#34;draws&#34; the characters.  She is a master at connecting the very different lives of each and making their perspectives become visible and believable to us as observers.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|I thought the story was engaging as the characters were very interesting. The ending was a little disappointing.  It just stopped with a short summary.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun and interesting, very time consuming though, I think the life timeline could be longer and find more objects
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I like zombie movies.  I usually like Brad Pitt movies.  This one was slow!  I couldn't wait for it to end.  Rent it don't buy it.
B0098QAAAC|4.0|A good film about the prospect of facing death and how you choose to live your final days among your friends.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great sound. Really relaxing. Several sounds to choose from. Did not have to take our sound maker from home. Easy to use.
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|Another ACC masterpiece. What is next after you have &#34;done it all&#34;? Arther C. Clark has taken us thru history in a way that is logical and concise. Well done!
B00F91H666|3.0|Fun but not a strong/riveting movie. Besides zombies, the basis of Pitt's character was weak. I'm glad I didn't pay theater price to see this.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This movie was boring.  I found nothing exciting about it.  Not much more I can say except to advise you to wait until it becomes Prime and watch it for free.  You won't be missing much.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|Beginning to think I really like British movies.  Great for understanding the time period.  Story line was captivating and the scenery was very good.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Okay, so they could've had a little more excitement in this movie.... However, it was still a pretty good watch.  I think Jaden Smith is becoming a good actor and he'll get even better with age/time.  I enjoyed seeing his character overcome his fear in the movie.  I think it sends a great message to young adults that they can overcome any fear, as long as you make up your mind to do so.  I'd even like to see more movies with this great dad and son working together.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Downloaded for my grandkids but find that my husband likes to play it as well.  Good graphics and ease of use.
0061438294|4.0|Interesting book that I would highly recomment to others to read. I have passed it on to other family members who have also found it enjoyable.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|Fun game....waiting for the update... and it is free...can't wait...  very hard at  first... keep them coming... looking forward to it
B009GJCFL8|5.0|This live recording is excellent.  I've heard some people complain about the engineering but I think it sounds great; close to studio sound.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|My wife was addicted.  Watched every episode at least once.  She has and many friends have discussed the sequence of the shows.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Heart-wrenching story of female hardship in Afganistan; just the kind of tale I like.<br />Beautifully told.<br />I think better than Kite Runner.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It was easy to understand--haven't had a lot of time play--but plan to do so--gave enough time to check all cards
B002R88G5E|5.0|I thought The Kite Runner would be hard to top but Khaled Hosseini has done it. A Thousand Splendid Suns is without doubt one of my favourite books, alongside the likes of The Grapes of Wrath and To Kill a Mocking Bird. This man has a special gift with language. He takes his reader into the story. Highly recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Dr Sleep was a page turner (3 am under the covers because I wanted to know what was next) that was a satisfying sequel. Felt like catching up on old friends, and meeting new ones. Yet another winner from Stephen King.
B00006879E|5.0|Classic album for a Maroon 5 fan and especially if your a 2002 MUSIC LOVER.  This is $ well spent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think its the best game ever who ever is debating wether or not to get it definitely a waist of money!!!!! you should get it now!!!!!!!!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|I kinda liked this more gritty telling of Dredd, which felt closer to what I expect from this ip.<br />Karl Urban has a rather limited range as an actor, but he role fit him better than I expected, though I laugh to think how much his jaw must have ached at the end of each take as I have never seen anyone frown so hard for soo long.<br /><br />The story was decent, and moved along at a reasonable clip.  Plenty of action.  My only complaint if that they over used the &#34;slowmo&#34; drug effect quite a bit.  It felt less like a plot device and more like this directors new favorite visual toy and he was going to beat the audience over the head with it until they liked it too.<br />Over all, not bad for a rental.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|If you follow politics and ever wondered how deals get done you will be afraid of the answer.  I rented the first episode to see what the &#34;Buzz&#34; was all about.  Five hours and five episodes later I knew.  Can't wait for season two.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I started reading this series because I loved the show so much. It is everything I expected and more. Very well written and action packed.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|What else would you like the book to be like?<br />It was quite eye opening for me.<br />Read it and see.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show. It really gets the mind working. The best episode is the last episode in season 2!!!
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|The movie was pretty good but I love streaming content.  I didn't have any issues watching the movie. I dropped my cable company for TV.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|tom Clancy has always been  a great writer and it is a shame that he is now gone .<br />hopefully someone will step up to the plate and keep his type of writing alive
B000002JSR|5.0|This is an album for a person looking to find great Led Zeppeling songs that aren't the hits.  I personally love \\"Poor Tom\\" and \\"Wearing and Tearing\\".  This album is definitely worth the price.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game sometimes it freezes up my kindle though. I like how it challenges my mind- I try fo solve the puzzle in my mind before trying it on the screen. My kids love it too.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was an excellent and easy read.  I thought the character development was great.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We are half way through the season and it's great, the movie freezes occasionally but the clarity is very good.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I love the Good wife.  Almost finished with Season 3 and can't wait to continue!  Great cast!  Love Will, he is my favorite.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|Overall, it's a good stand alone zombie movie. The title is all the book and the movie really have in common. Based on how the book was written it would be difficult to make it completely true to the book but they could have incorporated much more of the events in the book, maybe used some narration as well.
B000002ITW|3.0|Gift for my husband.  In good condition.
1401216676|5.0|Psychologically dense and intense but, overall, entertaining from the beginning to the end. This story is a true Batman classic: it involves one of the most intimate relationships between Batman and the Joker, the birth of the Joker and a key event that will change Gordon's, Barbara's and Batman's life forever. A bit chilling but you will be inmerse in the story from start to finish and it will leave you thinking a lot about sanity and insanity jajajaja....
B000I9YWDO|5.0|As a teacher, I couldn't get through grading days without this movie. It's all that gets me through the day!
B0094M2Z9O|1.0|The sound would not work. It is not my devise or TV. Tried everything but still nothing. Amazon you need to fix this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game for getting your game on I LOVED it was a great game. Yes it was hard to pass level one but still a great game.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Gatsby is a beautiful story, but the challenge is capturing Fitzgerald's beautiful narrative prose in the script, both visually and through language.<br /><br />This version makes it all work, presenting a convincing and often beautiful interpretation of one of the greatest American novels.  I loved it.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Entertaining and true to the spirit of Star Trek.  I didn't watch it when it was on TV, but glad I found it here.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I have listened to &#34; An Awesome Wave&#34; almost nonstop since I bought it. Alt-J is amazing and I love how the whole album flows together.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I love this book. I read it to my child and his class when he was 7. I'm now reading it to my grandchildren. It's funny, touching and it still makes me cry!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I usually only need to know the weather outlook, but there have times where more in-depth info was necessary. This app came in handy. I tried it as the free version, but I'm glad I upgraded.
B008DYZKQE|4.0|I thought this was a very cute book. My grandkids laughed as I was reading it. The illustrations are as amusing as the story.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|we've watched this movie a thousand times already but we're not tired of watching it..a great family movie...funny too!!...check it out folks!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It gives you a sense that there is life after. It also helps with ones faith. I have always thought that there was more to life than just getting up and going to work every day.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Fantastic show!  I should kick myself for waiting so long to start watching it. Not at all what I assumed it would be.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is seriously one of the best young adult books I've ever read! John Green is an awesome person and this is certainly his best work to date.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I tend to favor any tale, in writing or on the screen, where lives and stories intersect and ultimately join together to form conclusions that truly define the word satisfying.  This book did just that for me.  I never give away details because I am not a fan of that so I won't put anything else in this review other than to write that I finished this book in 1 day because I couldn't put it down.  I think most people will be very glad they read this book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is very addicting to play. I play it every single day, on my lunch breaks at work and every other chance I may get. I have only found one problem with this game and other games I have on my kindle and that is when ever it is time to update the games they update then restart me at level one other than that the games are always fun to play.
1444737112|5.0|Loved this book!  Cats are magic!!!  They help us humans be better people and brighten our world!!!  Great book! :)
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a great addition, it protects my headset and charges at the same time.  Very glad I ordered this additional piece.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Extremly fast download, Very easy to use.  A large vast selection of items to download.  I would recommend it.  I use it often.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've been on kik for a very long time , but now it's saying that it's an error and its taking too long to load. I've deleted the app hoping it would work but it wouldn't. The app is working perfectly fine on my iPhone , but it won't let me log in on my kindle. I read multiple reviews on this and many people are having the same issue. PLEASE FIX IT !!!
0515153656|3.0|Easy read.  Enjoyable experience overall.  Please,  someone out there teach this author about Firearms and combat tactics,  because he really gets these things wrong.  The character is fun,  the story is a good read,  but the action stuff,  very sparse and overall incorrect. Reacher cannot be as good as he thinks he is and make the decisions he makes.<br /><br />Stephen Hunter needs to teach Lee child about how to write operator types correctly.  Also,  being British and unaware regarding US military slang,  terms and techniques at times really shows,  and it is enough to doubt the characters and the scene.<br /><br />Read this,  but then go read \\"Point of Impact\\"  by Hunter.<br /><br />So far these books are enjoyable,  but they're not up to speed with similar pieces by other authors.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I love all of these stories by Cassandra Clare.  Very well written and easy to fall into.  The characters are well constructed and you get to know them well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is amazing I can now watch videos from my phone with no lag at all and its under $50 thanks Google.
B000001ED1|5.0|What a powerful woman. And this recording captures Joan Osborne's powerful voice. Blues, Rock and Soul, all rolled up in her music.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|I'm pretty heavily invested in the Outlander series. I love the characters, places and events. You know where the story is heading, generally speaking, because Claire or in this case Brianna and Roger know, but you've no idea how they might try to avert catastrophe. At the end of the day though, it's the relationships that keep me reading. Having said that, it was the relationships that slowed me down this time around.<br /><br />The story centres more around Brianna & Roger in this book. We learn more about them and their history. There was a constant, 'will they, won't they,' tension which I actually found a little irritating after several hundred pages. I found myself rolling my eyes because one of the two of them got angry at the other for something, AGAIN. The same is true of Jamie & Claire's relationship, it's very volatile and passionate but there were times where I hoped for a councillor to appear and take them through a session. There were bouts of terrible angst complete with swooning, wringing of hands and general female helplessness by both Claire and Brianna which I don't like at all. I believe both characters are extremely strong, and forthright, but also very feminine, the swooning just over exaggerates their vulnerability. Fortunately though, such things happened fairly rarely, and when they did I simply skimmed through the pages until everyone was less overcome.<br /><br />Otherwise, another excellent novel in the series. I was glad to see some old characters return and feature more predominantly, particularly Lord John who has quite a large role in the novel. It was also interesting to see a shift of focus towards Brianna and Roger, which made for an interesting change. We're also left in an excellent position for the next book. I will need a break before ploughing into the next book though, I don't want to wear them out.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I liked that fact that this was a little more of a traditional fairy tale. My kids really enjoyed it and I did not mind it. The acting was probably not Oscar worthy, but the characters were believable and I like them. Even the villains were more than one dimensional.<br /><br />On the whole a good family film, but probably too scary for the littlest ones.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|Fun, cute item?  Great buy for a child or a birthday present.  Monster high dolls are adorable and far more expensive in the stores.  Highly recommend this doll.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a wonderful calculator app and the crisp, clear and LARGE font make it a delight to use! I've shown it off and recommended to a number of my friends already!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is very entertaining but the constant ads are annoying. I guess that's the price you pay when it's free...
B00BQ4NLC8|4.0|Very gripping and skillfully written. thought provoking thriller, with a plot where the main characters face agonizing life situations that place them on the brink of despair. Unexpected ending, a little bit contrived, but required to give a definition to the story .
B0066W1AZK|4.0|A good game to teach concentration for older children and adults. I learned to play years ago,  but it is good for me to keep my mind sharp. I am currently teaching my 8 year old grandson how to play. He gets a little frustrated at times because he likened it to checkers. He is now understanding a little more and enjoying it.
B00AW57L96|4.0|This story brings many elements together to form a story of a heinous crime committed years before. The story tells of the impact of the crime to the family of the victim, the perpetrator and others impacted by what happened.<br />The story explores complex relationships in suburban Sydney and Melborne. The old saying of &#34;no one knows what goes on behind closed doors&#34;.<br />Really good read.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I know everybody likes minecraft and I do to. honestly. but minecraft pocket edition? I hate minecraft pe because number 1 the controls are hard and 2 there's barely anything compared to xbox! I don't own this game but I played it on other peoples phones and stuff and I think its bad. I mean its just my thinking of it. once again I LOVE minecraft just not pe. thanks for reading -----The Minecrafter.
B00CPWTRAA|5.0|He is amazing whether he sings tenor or baritone.  A wonderful artist that has not been matched yet.<br />Love this recording.  I have all his other ones
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Works great. I especially like being able to use your own music as your wake up sound. And it's great for traveling
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Definitely DO NOT buy this, just rent it.  Not very good...  I was very disappointed in this film.  Expected better from the reviews.
B0085CXVOC|3.0|I thought it was entertaining.  I like all the main characters, William H Macy, Penelope Cruz, Mathew Mcconaughy and the rest
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is fantastic. I couldn't put it down!! The other mortal instrument novels are just as amazing as well!
B0036BK6MW|1.0|It downloaded to my device slowly, and I fell asleep several times, because I could only view it in 20 second increments, and then had to wait 30-120 seconds for the next 20 seconds to load. I never saw the whole movie, and am very unsatisfied with the AMAZON experience.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love the characters and the plot twists throughout the show.  Men and women can enjoy watching the show together.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|I haven't bought an album in, I don't know, ten years? But I would have paid any price for this album. Haim is amazing. They have such an original sound. This is easily the greatest album of the new millennium. Give Haim all your money.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Great app that allows you to watch youtube videos when offline.  It occasionally crashes or won't properly download a video, but otherwise is excellent.
B00136Q1I0|5.0|I've been listening to Bruce Springsteen for over 30 years since my wife introduced me to his music when we were dating. We spent many years living in New Jersey and the Jersey shore and Bruce reminds us of that independent attitude and jersey 'edge' he represents. Badlands is such a great song ... I recall many times listening to it after a hard day at work early on in my career and at times wanting to get away from it all. The album brings back a host of memories of earlier days, youth and an independent spirit.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I absolutely love this game, but Gameloft is money hungry. The amount of gold and gem bits you need to collect are extremely high, to the point of being able to keep up with how quickly you make levels you would end up spending a small fortune. As I see it I will be farming resources for a long time just to get the next few ponies. I also don't understand what the motes of harmony are for so far, other than I have a lot that I can't do anything with. I would rather have paid for the game up front than have gameloft try to fleece me. Also beware about letting younger children play this, unless you lock them out from being able to purchase gold and gems or you will find yourself with a hefty bill to pay.
B002UD56I6|1.0|I don't know what the movie is about. I own DVDs of Michael Jackson History 1 & 2. I think they are a better bet.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Funny family friendly movie! Very entertaining for all ages. Not a dull moment, kept interest through out the entire movie.
B00E7SXPVW|5.0|Ingore the self appointed judges judging, pop this baby in the old CD player from middle school, and sink back into a time when Amazon reviews didn't exist. Every sound is like a seretonine reuptake enhancer, forcing me to face the poetic sadness of adulthood, and making me realize that rock is the soundtrack to adolescence and the bell curve of music's socitel roll started dropping after this was released. Sigh.
B00AALX5SI|1.0|This movie was boring and I got nothing out of it. Like her music but don't want to see a documentary of her.
B003PIS6GO|5.0|Good family movie, my 7 year old boy thinks it is the best movie ever!  His younger sisters liked it too, but it didn't beat our Brave as tops on their list.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|No problems. Really fun! I would recommend this game to anybody. Has lots of levels and is not boring to play!
B009D5VNLS|3.0|It's a solid Pixar film but I don't think it lives up to the others. Also for best animated feature i expected more. Liked the Scottish accents, though.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This app was great until I had to download it because my kindle got swiped. The new version is not so great. It often stops working and when it reads to you, that skips too. It has never happened before with the old version. New doesn't always mean better.
0307266303|5.0|Great reading for the runner in all of us. A must read for those looking to explore and/or expand their running adventure.
B001BR7CU2|5.0|It's one of the funniest 80's movies ever.  When I was compared to Kelly LeBrock from Weird Science, I felt that was my greatest compliment ever...
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Exceptionally well researched and well written, Command and Control was a pleasure.  I grew up during the last twenty years of the Cold War and felt that, with the end of Mutually Assured Destruction, Damocles' blade had been sheathed.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is not so.  Mr. Schlosser makes our current peril quite plain.  Humankind has finally built weapons so dangerous and destructive that, even with limited use, we risk our own extinction.  Even with the best command and control, weapon safety systems, and inventory procedures accidents with nuclear weapons were legion in the U.S. military for decades.  It is a small miracle that there was never an inadvertent nuclear detonation. That there will be one somewhere in the world, though, seems numerically and humanly inevitable.<br /><br />Late in the book he lays out the arguments of many old American Cold Warriors (former Secretaries of State and Defense, generals, admirals, and others) for either the abolition or near-abolition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons.  Henry Kissinger numbered among them, as did many other surprising eminences grises.<br /><br />I strongly recommend the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Had no interest in the book due to the premise.  My cousin told me she read it to her 10 year old nephew so I thought it must be okay.  I still have trouble reconciling the killing but honestly I couldn't put it down.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Havent had too much time to get into the book but so far it is good, I wish I couldn't put it down but I have to ...
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|This series did not tie everything up in a neat bow at the end. I like that - its good to see YA fiction starting to show that the world doesn't resolve every issue tidily at the end of the book / movie / hour long show. Its especially good to see in a series that covers a lot of serious teen issues while ostensibly a werewolf / paranormal romance.  Things like absentee parents, drug use, suicide, teen sexuality should have some lasting consequence and the series shows that.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Always fun to watch this. Seeing Leslie Neilson is a serious role is hard to get used to, though. I guess he was sort of a &#34;looker&#34; in his early days.<br /><br />Now if I can only find &#34;This Island Earth&#34;
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|My 13 year old devoured the series.  They are engaging reads and interesting stories. I thought the more mature themes (drug use, teen sexuality) were handled well - they were plot elements of the story not just added in for thrills.  There are consequences of actions shown and We had some good discussions about parent / teen relationships and teen romance based off it.  (Yeah I'm one of those annoying moms that have to read books marked with &#34;some mature content&#34; before I let my kid read them.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Jim Carrey at his best. My family watches this movie once every few years. We'll be watching I more now that we can stream it here on Amazon.com
1451637500|5.0|Lois McMaster Bujold is one of the best story  teller in the world and the Vorkosigan series is some of the best Science Fiction ever written. &#34;Cryoburn&#34; is either a great ending to the series or it is the end of the second act for our intrepid hero. Amazon as always delivered expediently and made ordering it painless.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Excellent production values and very good 3D. Totally enjoyed the show and will watch it again and again with enjoyment.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was a good book - the end really had me turning the pages! Its a little dark, but I loved the story. I think the characters were well developed.
0393024415|5.0|This is the only book I read cover to cover and went back to whilst raising my four kids. The two copies I previously owned have disappeared to help other families and I needed a replacement for the future (grand kids, neighbors, friends). All four get along really well and I have to credit the techniques from this book, it made everyone's life so much happier.
B0083H6AQA|3.0|Having a man &#34;sleep&#34; his way up the social ladder is odd to watch.  There are many Hollywood movies where the woman does that and so I suppose that's what I'm used to (not that in real life that's what happens).  But it felt weird seeing a man doing it, and especially someone so dark and moody.  What would seriously attract a woman, especially a smart, sexy, and wealthy woman to want a nothing man; nothing in terms of personality and nothing in terms of wealth?  That made the movie much less believable to me.  Women are smarter than that.  To be sure there were some stellar acting moments in the movie.  Cristina Ricci was the most believable character in this movie and gave one of her better performances I feel.  Over all, it's a so-so movie, but not one that I would want in my library.
0385528787|4.0|Absolutely loved Oryx and Crake, loved the Year of the Flood and I like this one. I'm about halfway through and get the sense of i's being dotted and t's crossed. Often the way with the end of trilogies after all the only people who read the third one are those who REALLY want to know all those details. Not as compelling as the other two but a must read if you want the skinny on the whole shebang.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|Since this is based on a true story I was interested in seeing the movie.  It did not disappoint, although a bit too graphic for my tastes at times.  I thought it was well acted, believable even in most of the special effects, and not too long to sit through.  What a difficult tragedy to have to endure, and yet many people did exactly that.  It was overwhelming at times and left me speechless at others.  I found myself actually talking to the TV when I watched it (does anyone else do that?) and on the edge of my seat much of the time.  It did not glorify the death and destruction but made you realize just how awful it was.  The acting was good, for the most part and had some very heart warming and wrenching moments.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was an amazing, thought provoking story. The Characters felt so real to me. I can't wait to read another one of Loaned books.
B00AEFYSEA|3.0|This is a very weird and strange western, but you'll find yourself intrigued at times too.  I found myself shaking my head at times thinking, &#34;This is too bizarre&#34; and at other times, &#34;What the heck?&#34; but was able to at least watch the whole movie.  Once was enough for me.  So glad I got it for a low price.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|I mean, it's an app.  I didn't know this was going to show up in my Amazon reviews screen.  Oh well.  The app works and it works well.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Chihiro is a little10 year old who accidentally gets trapped in the spirit world when her parents get too greedy and are turned into pigs. Chihiro must find the courage to help her parents & herself return to the human world.  The fantasy takes place in a Japanese bath house with wonderful, funny characters.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I mean, it's an app.  I didn't know this was going to show up in my Amazon reviews screen.  Oh well.  The app works and it works well.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|We watch it over and over again. I love how different it is and how it is kid friendly. It is the favorite show of my household. If you haven't watched it  you should try it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I mean, it's an app.  I didn't know this was going to show up in my Amazon reviews screen.  Oh well.  The app works and it works well.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The best thing I could have done was not read any reviews and pre-commentary before the movie was released.  I'm a Trekkie, I'm a Star Trek fan so I knew I was going to see it no matter what.  So when he said my name is Khan that blew me away.  My daughter looked at me and said the look on my face was priceless.  Later J.J. Abrams said he was hoping to get a gasp from the audience when Khan identified himself.  Well he got one from me.<br /><br />I can also say I like all of the new actors playing the younger versions of the characters we love so much.  The movie was exciting and thrilling.  Since receiving my DVD I have looked at it at least 10 times so far.  It's a movie you can watch over and over.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I mean, it's an app.  I didn't know this was going to show up in my Amazon reviews screen.  Oh well.  The app works and it works well.
B006BQNJR8|4.0|I wouldn't say this would ever win an academy award for it's acting but there is plenty of action if that is what you are looking for.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I mean, it's an app.  I didn't know this was going to show up in my Amazon reviews screen.  Oh well.  The app works and it works well.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's nice to be able to read all of my books on my phone when I don't carry my Kindle with me.
006016848X|5.0|Great read!!! This books will help you understand the opposite sex. Very helpful if you struggle with why people do the things they do.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|a newer version of the typical teen angst shows, fun with some good lessons... of course this is based in a more &#34;well to do&#34; area near Hollywood...
B009LDD22U|5.0|I never miss an episode of this and can watch each one over and over. Everyone should watch at least three episodes and they will be a fan.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Were going into our 5th Season and so far, it's been a wonderful series to watch. Right on the edge of our seat sometimes.
B00AKKS278|3.0|I found this book interesting, but it does not deliver that magical transformation it promises. I felt quite tired after 5 days practicing the suggested morning regime. However, I think that there is an useful lesson in it and perhaps I will adjust some of what book prescribes to my needs.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|i like the idea of chromecast.  it works well with netflix.  nice for movie night with the kids.  but as far as i know the uses are limited.  you can't use on some random website.  only established, contracted sites like netflix.  admittedly, i could be wrong.  as i am not the most tech savvy person --  there may very well be a way to use with other websites that i haven't figured out yet.
B004G6009K|5.0|It's a decent movie as Disney films go.  My 5 year old loves the movie.  The 3D is great, and the digital copies are great for the iPad on car trips for the little one.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|For a hidden objects game it's more absorbing than I expected. You can buy items with real money in the game but I don't, I like that I have to wait for energy to be restored because it leaves me wanting more, I can tactically decide how to use the energy I have and it limits my time on it; otherwise I might be on it for hours. Early on it's not too demanding but later on it can get quite tricky. I try not to use tools unless really necessary.
0062238868|5.0|Great books with an amazing story. The topic of this book is very special to me. I was enthralled by the story.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan of Ariana Grande every song is amazing. She has the voice of an angel and a tremendous asset as a role model to our youth today. A very well respected artist keep up the wonderful  work!!!
0307730700|4.0|Great books with an amazing story. The topic of this book is very special to me. I was enthralled by the story.
B009PJXY3M|5.0|It's hard to find non-explicit pop music for elementary age girls. Bridgit Mendler is one of our go to artists because of her great voice, fun songs, and just good music. I purchased this download for my 10 year old daughter because she loved Bridgit's first release, &#34;Ready or Not&#34;. I always screen what my girls listen to and this album is just clean, good music. Recommend this album to any mother looking for an artist like Taylor Swift that can make great music without the need to use explicit language.
0316044695|5.0|Great books with an amazing story. The topic of this book is very special to me. I was enthralled by the story.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it made me want to keep reading to find out what the next chapter had in store. It is unusual in the way it's written, as it bounces back and forth through different time periods. The characters are interesting and complex. I also appreciate clean books, as this one is. I would, and have, recommended this book to others.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was actually surprised how well made this movie was and I enjoyed it. I usually don't like big box office movies but this was pretty darn good.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|Sorry...the 1974 was closer to the truth. Too much modern music - yes, I know the era replicates todays but lets play fair...this is a classic - you really don't have to mess with it (I like DiCaprio's Gatsby better than Redfords - although RR did an outstanding job) Best part thing to take away from the movie was &#34;Young & Beautiful&#34; didn't fit the era...but I love that song.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Everything from the soundtrack, to the acting to the gorgeous scenery was done perfectly. Well worth watching!
B000VI12ZS|4.0|The American Indiana always got a bum rap from the government. But I think they had the last laugh in WWII.
B0040I09RM|1.0|Too violent for my taste. To each their own, though and if you like biker gangs this is for you!
B003XFVSTG|2.0|OK, it's a story as old as time...but really...send in the clowns.<br />Girl meets boy, girl loses boy, is girl trying to do something noble or does she just want to sing?<br />I should not have wasted my money.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Entertaining on may levels but lacking the substance I was hoping for.  I think the women had more to say but never got to it.
0756655307|5.0|We own the DC Encyclopedia, which is equally as awesome, so we had to own the Marvel Encyclopedia as well. Very informative, especially with back story information for our 10 year old daughter with a million questions!
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|I've long been a Jack Johnson and play his songs as covers.  I believe Brushfire Fairytales contains his best compositions, but this effort is enjoyable.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I am not a Tom Cruise fan but I could not stop praising his performance in this show.  Tom Cruise played such a great rock star and such a difference from his public persona that it showed his acting chops better than any other performance since Top Gun!<br /><br />WIN WIN
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This was the best movie we've seen this year! It was fast paced, and action packed all the way through. We don't like fast moving zombies though....
B0040I09RM|5.0|I am totally hooked!  I HATE that there will only be 7 seasons!!! WRITERS PLEASE RECONSIDER!!!  I haven't even started watching the recent shows because I am so hooked on the past seasons!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I personable loved this book, it really had me thinking back to thlse days.  Loved the way it was written, very personable, feels like you are right there in the room.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I have only used htis app a few times but find it fully functional and very easy to use. I have not attempted to use the scientific functions because I don't know how but I'm sure they work.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|This app is good for loking up videos, but make sure you have great signal or they will freeze up on you.
1616550414|5.0|This book brings back a lot of memories. The book itself is very sturdy hardback and the illustrations are gorgeous. I would recommend this to any Zelda fan, young or old.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I'm not sure why any person in thier right mind would run through a field of zombies, but I love this addicting game. Its nice when you only have a few minutes to spare and it will get your mind going about stategy. Very addicting!
B0091WAWTM|1.0|I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.  It was terrible.  The remake was so much better.  It was a waste of time and money.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It gve me quick and accurate information on what the weather is like and going to be like within the next week.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Creative plot with engaging characters. Lots of &#34;fringe&#34; science for us sci-fi junkies. Walter Bishop's character is put there, and love Olivia!
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I use it to update posts on my page, but I really wish that I could do more with it. It's kind of hard to update on the Kindle as well. The app is telling me that there is an update but will not allow me to update it. It keeps redirecting me to the google marketplace.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|always felt like i was missing something....could not quite follow.  BUT I KEPT ON READING, so i must have enjoyed it.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|One of the funniest way to learn how a normal cat can behave. If you are a new cat owner read this.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Cute movie, 4 year old daughter enjoyed the movie. I also enjoyed the movie as well. Was able to watch before redbox had it.
B000S81MHY|5.0|Now this is a quality tool. smaller than I thought it would be, but very well made. light weight alum body, very precision movement.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Ending wrapped up too neatly...would've liked more of a twist - liked Gone Girl much more but it was decent
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout for beginners and expierenced fitness buffs alike. I would start off doing it every other day instead of daily as suggested simply because of the wear and tear on your joints. Overall great workout DVD!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|It is truly a gem amongst so many adaptations. The directing, acting, and overall quality is excellent. the sound track is timeless and the scenes will stick with you. While obviously having changes from the original text to screen, they did a great job keeping the emotional attachment and overall story line similar. Would recommend for any age.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I try to make an account then it says it takes to long to register. Don't get this app. I have deleted it then tried it then and still didn't work. After that I record it and redowloded every thing then it still didn't work.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I love how the characters are developed in this story. Tons of detail, but no fluff. Nice twist at the end.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Scored this addicting app when it was the free app of the day. Good casual fun and hard to put down.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is a really wonderful book and is written in such a way as to be understood by future generations.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Genre: non-fiction<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />I wasn't actually planning to write a review today, but I honestly don't want to do what I'm supposed to be doing right now (*cough cough* work). So I decided to write a quick book review.  I actually read this book a while back (4 months ago?). But I absolutely adored it and immediately reread it again right after I finished. Perhaps some of you are wondering: \\"Tina, why do you choose this book of all the past books you've read to review?\\" Well, it all goes with today's theme: running. As I'm here typing this, I'm rubbing some icy hot onto my calves--just completed my second half marathon today :-) Alright, nuff said about me. Let's get to the review.<br /><br />​The story (true story, by the way) opens up with Christopher looking for a mysterious guy named Caballo Blanco (aka White Horse). Troubled by foot pains, he hopes to find some answers to his problems. After searching all over the country for White Horse, Christopher finally finds the legendary runner. And from there, an epic adventure is born. In the quest to answer the question why ​people run, Christopher takes readers back to the history of running thousands of years ago to modern day experiments at top science labs.<br /><br />Early on, the Tarahumara Indians are introduced into the book. They are a secretive group who live in Mexico. They also seem to have supernatural powers, being able to run over 200 miles in one go. To them, 30-50 miles is only a \\"quick run in the park.\\" So how is it possible, that these people are running ultra marathon distances on a daily basis, that they don't get hurt? Over 50% of runners get injured annually. Christopher himself feels as if he spends more time recovering rather than running. Thus, a quest is born: to find out what is the secret to running.<br /><br />​In his quest, he meets quite an array of characters, from an amazing running coach named Eric to Jenn and Billy (a dynamic duo) and of course, to the elusive Caballo Blanco. Events seem to unfold on their own accord as Christopher continues his quest, events that he would've never even dreamed of happening before.  I don't know what else to write without giving away the whole story because I'm afraid I won't be able to stop the words spilling out of me, lol.<br /><br />Anyways, whether you're a runner or not, this is a must read! This book will make you laugh, it will make you cringe, it will inspire you and it might make you want to go out for a run the moment you're finished with it.<br /><br />Likes:<br />  *extremely interesting<br />  *amazing true-events!<br />  *memorable characters<br />  *love the narration voice<br />  *inspirational!<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />​  *Some facts might have been unnecessary...I don't know....<br /><br />​<br /><br />​<br /><br />​
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|too bad it is over!  Excellent production...easy viewing online, even for limited broadband servers like i have access to! great service!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Apparently it is a good thing that I didn;t read the book before seeing the movie as many people felt cheated by this movie adaptation of the book. Before the movie was released I had heard rumors that there was trouble with the final product, that Mr Pitt was not pleased with the way things turned out & had gone in to make some changes. True or not, you can see the problems in this movie pretty easily -- plot issues that just make no sense more than anything else.His wife impulse calls him while he juuust happens to be in the middle of trying to be QUIET while getting back to his plane in Korea which results in many good guys dying-- Brad knows the Zombies are attracted by noise but he takes his sweet time telling the Israelis about it! OK maybe he was jet lagged. Too many such contrived/silly moments. I am not a watcher of Zombie stuff so the implausibilty of fast moving Z's didn;t bother me at all. In fact I thought it was about time someone came up with some speedier undead. It made the<br />  attacks visceral & pretty damn horrific. Bad stuff tends to happen quickly even if the buildup to it is slow. I actually felt that the movie itself took off too fast.........one family scene then BAM Philly goes to heck in a hand basket in 5 minutes. Have your popcorn ready before you click Play. Yeah maybe Brad turns out to be the luckiest guy on Earth -- pretty much everyone dies around him--but his acting isn;t overly macho & he IS used to being in touch'n Go situations so I didn;t have a hard time believing that he could be so cool under pressure. And I thought the story-line of him & the Israeli woman soldier was done very nicely. It's tough to be noticed as a supporting actor in a movie like this but I thought the soldier in Korea, the UN contact, the UN plane's pilot, the WHO Lab workers & many others all did fine jobs. Even with all of its flaws this movie was worth the $3.99 rental fee & we watched it 3 times in 48 hours & each time it got a bit better & a bit clearer. The Zombbie pile up at the wall was both silly and impressive. But the best scene is at the end when things slow down enough to allow for human interaction & a slower build-up to tension. The sad creepy jaw-snapping Zombies make the human moments even more gripping. The ending was kinda obviously \\"tacked on\\" but by that point you really do not need or want any more \\"action\\"! You want to be talked down by Brad & allowed to settle a bit. So really I'd rate this 3.5 stars with the warning that I am not a Zombie connoiser, did not read the book & didn;t set the bar too high to begin with & thus wasn't overly disappointed with this movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card has done it again, with this book. It grabs you at the start and sucks you into Ender's world and life, and you won't want to put it down!
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|This game is very cute and pleasant to play, yet it is very challenging. I am stuck at one of the lower levels. Timing is everything with this game as you must get in sync with granny flipping through her jumps. Once she falls, she seems to lose to much time and momentum to catch up to the thief.  It's cute how she just plows through everything. No violence or gore, just granny trying to collect her apples and some coins. The coin collection aspect is reminiscent of the old Sonic games where he runs around collecting coins, but if he gets hit with anything, he loses them, just like granny loses her coins when she falls.
B00F88GRSS|5.0|The inside story of the true  Liberace as only his close friends knew him . I can't help but feel sorry for Scott . The kid was only 16 years old at the beginning or this Story and he was used and then kicked to the curb when he lost favor  of Mr Show man ship a sad story indeed and one you will not forget . it is an inside look at a world  of  opulence the rest of us can only imagine,  hats off to the fine actors who were outstanding in their portrayal of the characters
B0035HKWLW|4.0|This movie is a great way to fit Jim Carrey's wackiness into a story. It also must have been a real marvel of computer graphic special effects for its time. And the swing dancing is fun to watch.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|This is a gripping, action-filled thriller about an important lesson: fear. It teaches us that fear is an illusion; that it is a choice.  The only place where fear exists is in a future realm that is not yet present.  Both Will Smith and his son give awesome performances.
B0084670FU|3.0|A couple in L.A. go on a trip to Morocco leaving their two young kids in the care of a Mexican nanny. The couple's return is delayed by a tragic incident in which the wife gets shot. The nanny already had plans to go back to Mexico for her son's wedding and, still stuck with the kids and finding no other options, decides to bring the kids with her. Disaster ensues. Meanwhile, back in Japan, a deaf young woman is emotionally disturbed. Because of problems communicating with the hearing world, she decides that the best way to fit in to the popular culture there is to  walk around Tokyo in a micro miniskirt with no underwear. She flashes \\"The Hairy Monster\\" at various men in hopes they will be moved to have sex with her. Yes, you get to see her Hairy Monster which would have been much better left to the imagination. How she ties in with the story is revealed much later.<br /><br />The movie was interesting and well acted and there is suspense in waiting for the disaster that you know will happen to happen. It has that jerky cam reality feel, which I think adds to it. But I was put off by the prurient pussy flashing, so I gave it 3 stars instead of 4.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a time is intriguing and well written.  The plot twists well and leaves you waiting for the next episode
B0063IH60K|5.0|First game app I ever downloaded. Have this on my phone... and now it's on my Kindle, too. Used it successfully as an aide to quit smoking, and I just enjoy playing it to relax or to pass the time if I'm waiting at the doctor's office, etc. Plus, it's free. I like that it's easy to use and that I can turn off the sound. The ads (between games) can be annoying, but with the sound off they are not as obnoxious, plus it's easy to cancel them and get back to the game.
B005GYGCOI|5.0|First and foremost, I would recommend the digital version of the book. Its physical brother is 1200 pages!<br />Lonely Planet always has a beautiful way to organize and categorize information. The short paragraphs are perfect to read on the go and get summarized information in order to move in this beautiful country.<br />Lonely Planet is a brand name, so you make a really safe bet when you but this or any of their books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this! Lots of free puzzles, varying levels of difficulty...  so it works for my grandkids as well as with my husband and me. Great way to relax.
B00004X10B|5.0|This is a fantastic bag! I have it loaded with some pretty heavy camera equipment and I trust it's structural integrity. I recommend keeping an eye on lint that can accumulate in the bottom of the bag from removing and attaching the velcro dividers. It does happen but cleaning it out is a breeze.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Exciting and well written. Had trouble not calling in sick so I could just watch the whole season at once.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I look to the weather channel for instant updates. I use the app on my kindle &amp; Android. No problems ever. And I have updates wherever I travel.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I knew I loved this movie, I had a nice blu-ray of it. I needed more, and I found this...THIS IS THE BLU RAY SET YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED IF YOU LOVE THIS MOVE. I may have a problem now, because I cannot stop throwing this on. Its a must have.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Highly recommended.  Enjoying doing all cells in order.  And, then redoing to beat my previous score.  Told everyone to try.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Not sure if I love this record, but this is a decent version of a decent album. I suppose if you are a NIN fan, then get a version of this.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a thriller, and I couldn't change pages fast enough.  I also have many of the paper books.  Loved it!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a great story, well-written and well-told. The two stories of Vivian navigating the foster care system in the 1920s-1930s and the Molly in present time are woven together very well. It is a great read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love, Love, Love it and the first.  Ready to think about buying the second.  And can't wait for the movie !!!!
0374533555|5.0|This book changed how I appreciate the workings of what we call &#34;the mind.&#34; The data appears solid and the author seems a humble scientist, who is more interested in the questions, the methods and even his own contradictions then in proving his theory of things. The book is full of examples, and exercises to test your self, but the more technical parts (equations and mathematics) might not be readily understandable for the more humanists and romantics among us. I have had a some trouble getting through it but it is so fascinating that I am not planning on giving up.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|this game is ok it gets old very fast I don't recommend this game not my favorite.the car does not go that fast.
B007SGM084|2.0|I've read all three books and the writing was fair. Story also. Too much sex.  I mean how many times does someone have sex.  The book was fair.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great read from Stephen King. You will not be disappointed in Doctor Sleep!! I couldn't put it down! Highly recommended!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I have used this app several times. Great for finding the keyhole in the dark. It really comes in handy in dark places. LOL!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|So far so fun only getting a 3 for now may change later.i like the sling shot its different from rest of bubble games
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Can't go wrong with Ironman! Love all the ironman movies.  They are some of my son's favorites.  Robert Downey Jr. never disappoints.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Got this on a whim and glad I did. Lots of fun, easy & Addictive. Find myself going back to play again and again!
0440423228|5.0|My grandson loves this series.  He reads them over and over again.  Very creative and entertaining.  I recommend this book.
0060191325|5.0|Our pastor had lost his copy & needed a new copy for his counseling work. It still applies to our world today even though it has been out over 20 years.
044042321X|5.0|My two grandsons love this series.  It keeps them engaged and they stay focused and committed to read the book to completion in one sitting.  The books provide creative inspiration to influence their other school interests.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Fairytale Poems - Darkened Fairytales -some more so than others. Some I liked, some I really liked and some, not so much, but I did enjoy these. Page 25 page me think, hummm! Loved the Rickety Lodge.<br />Poetry- short stories - they allow the reader to picture an image in their mind. They encourage the reader to stop and think 'Always there Never dies'- 'right 'til the end'
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|No it was not, and it never is, but I will say that they did an excellent job of keeping the movie as accurate as they could to the book.<br />I think that Peeta was miscast. He's not very handsome.  I like Donald Sutherland as the president, Cinna played by Lenny Kravitz is a good role for him, and Jennifer Lawrence does a pretty good job as Katniss.  The special effects work here, as it's tough to mix them with a post apocalyptic world.  It's hard to fit so much detail in so little time.  It was a good first attempt, so let's hope that Catching Fire does a much better job and doesn't have as much cheese.
B00DGGIXS6|1.0|I DO like some of Cher's music.  Unfortunately, this CD only has 1 song I like.  All of the selections on this CD have the same arrangement, lyrics change little.  I wonder how many drummers she went through?<br />Disappointed.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I'd give this app 5 stars but it doesn't work anymore, like I don't even know why but please fix the app -_______-
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|My 7 yr old daughter likes it. I liked it too, just didn't have time to play a lot. Nice game.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I love to play backgammon and this app is a great time filler!  I haven't tried multi-player yet, but am having fun beating the computer. :-)
B0069JBKHI|1.0|This product is TERRIBLE!  We had issues from day one!  The monitor would stop working through the night and after all the &#34;online help&#34; nothing changed. We even went so far as to get a &#34;booster&#34; for the internet in hopes that would somehow make a difference and it didn't.<br /><br />Also their customer service is TERRIBLE!!! They only have online support that is ridiculously slow to respond. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I am now trying to get a refund and even though it falls within the manufacturer's warranty they are only offering a replacement or another one of their products (which has nothing to do with baby monitors)..  I had high hopes for this device and it was a TOTAL disappointment.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|It's Vacation, come on!  Well, ok.  Vegas Vacation was a bit of miss but this one is too funny and every family can see a little of their own family in this at some point
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|The only bad thing I can say about it is that it jumps around in time a bit too much, which makes the ending hard to follow.
B00BMNM4H6|2.0|This could have possibilities but not for this senior citizen. Perhaps if I spent more time with the game I would pick up on the meaning of the various icons and their usefulness in playing the game.
B008MVP964|4.0|My son likes these but are a tad large for him, they will fit nicely with socks for the fall and in spring they will fit without!
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|It's easy to get the concept of the game but it's not my preference in games as compared to Mahjong, Sudoku.
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|I purchased this for my husband as an anniversary gift.  This two disc edition has good bonus features.  Excellent quality.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game if you want to relax yet be slightly challenged at the same time.  Great graphics!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it's great I love horses<br /> It's fun but it get a little boring when you don't have energy
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Every intimate scene was repetitive and basically the same , the only intelligent parts of the book were the internet communications.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|I've always loved this movie. I bought it for that reason and to share it with my kids to enjoy as I did and still do.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|If you're a Hip Hop fan you will be highly satisfied with this CD. I loved every single song! I've been listening to it since September 24 and it is still good. I listen to it everyday!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|For a show about a serial killer, it's pretty darn good. In fact, the early years are probably better than the later season shows 6-8. It's a pretty solid series.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love Bruno Mars and this new CD. The songs on it sound great.  I downloaded all of them to my iPod.
B009LDD22U|5.0|I think this is the best show on TV. It makes me laugh every time, and I can watch episodes over and over again without ever getting bored.
034580404X|1.0|If you are looking for a good writing/ story book to read, forget these books. Don't waste your money and time.  If you want sex porn type reading material, then these are the books for you. I bought this trilogy because it was so popular. I thought these books must be really good. Well, I was wrong. It took me almost a year to finish them because I kept on putting them down, I continued to read them because I hate wasting money. Storyline was stalling and going no where. Also, they are very predictable. Like one reviewer said (I should have read her review before wasting my money), if you removed all the sex, the character's blushing, biting her lip, etc...there would be just 50 or less pages left for the story.  Don't get me wrong, I have read lots of books with tons of erotic sex in them too but there are great story involved and not to mention great writing. One good example, read Karen Marie Moning, the Highlanders series.  My analogy to the 50 shades: triple X porn movie without story. All you get is the unbelievable sex scene that eventually bored you to death.
1250029465|5.0|An incredible book.  I couldn't put it down, and it is really a wonderful story.  I very highly recommend this one!!!
B00F4PM6WG|4.0|My kids like this game a lot.  The only part they don't care for is that there isn't more options, but they still play it all the time.  Super fun game for ages 2-6.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book gives a view into how women were treated in Afganistan.  It is also an excellent story of the main character's struggles within this culture and her determination to find peace in her life.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A TREKKIE AND THIS NEW SERIES IS GREAT. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT. THE CHARACTERS ARE A GOOD MATCH FOR THE ORIGINALS.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Philippa Gregory writes a beloved story of a nation's beloved queen and an unbeloved wife. A fictional rationing of the unknown tale of an undiscovered Prince and his sister's hard journey. A favorite.
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|it does not pause when you are quitting video, so every time you want to continue, you have to search where did you stoped
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I really enjoyed all of the elements in this book, but I especially loved that the author made all of the characters multi-faceted and flawed.
B0044I6FZI|5.0|I have been watching the four seasons religiously thru amazon prime but then this option was removed. What's up with that?  Please bring amazon prime back to Prison Break. I am sure I am not the only one that was left out hanging out to dry . Amazon prime needs to be back to this great series!!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Historical information presented through fiction.  Though heartbreaking in its realism, it is interesting and very well-written.  Glad I read it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is by far the best game I have played on a mobile device ever.  I even like some aspects of this game better than most console and PC games!
B0000TB014|2.0|the quality of this video is horrible! it looks like someone sat in front of their tv and recorded this with a camcorder (yeah, it's that bad).
B009EHDU7U|5.0|What a wonderful story.  the main character is sort of Forest Gump-ish where his simply outlook on life gets him through many an exciting experience where other mere mortals would perish.  A brilliant read quite unlike anything else I have ever read.  Highly recommended by this Kiwi
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Very well written.. I am quite Impressed with the story. Everything connected well. Great acting too.... Excellent work. Looking forward to the new episodes.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Full of surprises! Twists and turns that leave you wishing you could stop doing everything and just read or listen.
B0040I09RM|3.0|I love this show, I gave it only 3 stars because the streaming was really bad!! It kept stopping every few minutes to load, and took a lot longer to watch. Will continue to catch up with Amazon because the show is awesome.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is a very good show! It's interesting and I like the actors in it!<br />I hope there is more to come!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was searching for a bedtime story along the lines of Miss Peregrine's Home... and this is perfect. You won't be disappointed
1451695195|5.0|A very detailed account of a NDE from the viewpoint of a neurologist who discounted reports of NDE before his experience.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|An easy satirical read filled with both modern history and criminal adventure. A great choice for casual book clubs (especially those inclined to focus more on wine than words) or for a book to read over a lazy long weekend by the pool. Overall, well-written and enjoyable.
B007C52NY2|5.0|All three books are astounding to read. Clever story lines, interesting characters such as Lisbeth Salander . She's a freelance surveillance agent and her work leads her into hot water. If you want to know more then read the book yourself because I don't want to spoil the plot for readers.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My old CPU fan was starting to make a LOT of noise - it was audible from a few rooms over!  I got the Cooler Master 212 Plus.<br /><br />Install went very easy.  My case (Cooler Master HAF932) has a motherboard tray with a CPU cutout, so I didn't even have to remove the motherboard from the case!  Installation took about 30-45 minutes, as I went slow and re-did some of my cable management while I was in there.  It runs much quieter and keeps the CPU much cooler than the stock unit!<br /><br />I'll get one of these for any other computers I build - I now consider it a must-have!
1476727651|5.0|It's been years since I enjoyed reading again . I felt as excited as a child reading a Harry Potter  book! I would recommend this book not  just to Steven King  fans but anyone who enjoys reading a great book. P.S  I think Steven got his idea of the character rattle snake from the girl with the dragon tattoo.jk
B006O6F932|5.0|this high school is exceptional, excellent matching details to the movies/specials and its large enough to accomodate all of Isabella's dolls love it.  you get a lot of items for the price its wonderful!
B00DHNJGCU|4.0|Good movie with lots of action! Kept us entertained through out the entire movie. Would watch it again if nothing else to do.
B008B68IEA|5.0|great detail and it comes with a good deal of things for the price love that it includes a bed for her pet
B00F35B8F8|3.0|I liked the first movie in this series touch better. This movie had a lot of action, and was exciting and visually stunning at times, however the plot was just plain and at times seemed to have some holes in it
B000F8O35U|4.0|love the movie and it looks and sounds great disc two was kind of a bummer for my almost 4 year old though
B005HP2J66|5.0|Cave of Forgotten Dreams is an excellent documentary on prehistoric cave paintings.  The filming is excellent and the commentary enlightening and thought-provoking.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Muscle Shoals is one of the most accurate movies ever made regarding the early years of Rock n Roll.  If you get the opportunity I highly recommend seeing this movie and when you get a chance touring the Muscle Shoals area.
B00846REIS|5.0|I downloaded this because Amazon said if you liked 50 shades you'd like this... I did. Waiting for the next one to come out.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I couldn't stop reading.  Love knowing how life turned out for &#34;Doc&#34; after the Overlook.  I always check the mirrors whenever I stay at a grand hotel and I never pull the shower curtain closed either.<br /><br />Some things stay with you forever.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|my seven year old loved this movie. Its not bad for parents who are watching it either, I laughed at the jokes and genuinely enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its an awesome game I play it with my friends but the only thing is that it sometimes freezes my device but I still love the game
B00845PV16|1.0|the story line was drawn out and seemed to go nowhere. I actually fell a sleep at one point because I was so disinterested.
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|Got through the first level and then got stuck with the same scenario over and over , boring and no explanation as to get to g further .
B009LDD1X0|5.0|If you want a box set of shows you will watch over and over and still find hilarious each time, I recommend the best show on TV, The Big Bang Theory. We have every season of this awesome series on DVD and it get funnier each time we see it. The characters gain more depth each season, and there are priceless scenes where we witness their growth, through the amazing writing and brilliant acting of the whole cast. Also the extras are awesome (as always with these Big Bang sets). After getting to know and really love these characters, it is so interesting and enlightening to see the actors talk about the characters they play, and on this set they talk about themselves as onscreen couples. It also includes a great gag reel.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game. Love playing with friends!!! My friend got me addicted to it! Been playing for a few days but recommend it anyone who enjoys simple games.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is such a great way to play with people and friends. I love the fast paced action. It's entertaining and fun to try and get the achievement for each new game.
111846446X|5.0|I was very happy to find this on Amazon.  This is truly the best first introduction to the Raspberry Pi.  Eben gives you insight into exactly what you need to know to get things up and running, how to troubleshoot common problems, and how to get your feet wet in the expansive realm of possibilities that the Pi gives us.<br /><br />Easy to read and understand!
B0014CQNTK|5.0|love this movie, got here just in time, love that it comes with the digital copy and the DVD. awesome!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I found the story line refreshing the characters diverse  and believable. A real loss when this series was cancelled. I bought the series.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong very much.  I like the idea there are no numbers on the tiles to match; that you match the looks of the tiles.  I do still have trouble knowing which flowers match since they are not always look alike matches.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Between Her Voice and His Music, You Have One Great CD !! Have Played this Almost Non Stop Since Recieving !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it a lot works great . Easy to use. The large display is easy to read. I do recommend this to anyone.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This story is original in a way few movies are in today's world, mixing a kid's search for parents with listening/music.  After viewing it, I see and hear the world in a new way, more sensitive the the rhythms around me and the music inherent in life.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong! Fun & more challenging with each level you complete. Very addicting!!! If you love mahjong you will like this game. Enjoy!!!
1250030951|5.0|I've LOVED Rainbow since her debut book Attachments and was so excited to read Fangirl! If you don't want to read spoilers you might not want to read my review. That's a BIG WARNING because I'm going to talk about things that happen and didn't happen in the book! So DO NOT read this if you do not want to know!<br /><br />I loved Fangirl for so many reasons, one of the biggest reasons is that Rainbow has a way of capturing a character and bringing that character to life on a page. I loved how Levi's and Cather's relationship blossomed on the pages. I could picture Cather in her argyle pink and green sweater with her hair in her ponytail. I could smell Levi, all coffee beans and cigarettes, see that hair of his, and envision him 'leaning' on everything and smiling at everyone. One disappointment for me, AND THIS IS A SPOILER so I told you NOT TO READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK:<br /><br />I really wasn't ready to be done with their relationship when the book ended. When I finished, I felt like I wanted more of Levi and Cather, and I suppose that is the best compliment you can give to an author -- to want to know what else happens with the characters, to want to follow them around some more, to live inside of their heads for a while longer. I just felt like they weren't DONE yet. And I know Fangirl is a YA book, but there was so much alluding to the sex part of their relationship, I really wanted that sex scene to happen. I personally felt like it needed to happen! :)<br /><br />I have not read fan fiction but Rainbow made it understandable for those of us who have not followed that 'genre' which was probably a difficult task to take on. It was almost as if she wrote two books in one. Simon Snow was a character she had to create as well, and the whole plot of Baz and Simon was interesting to follow along with. It was intriguing to me and I am assuming she combined Twilight and Harry Potter, which are probably two of the biggest fan fiction books people write about. I loved that aspect of the book.<br /><br />The fact that Wren was her twin and that the two were so separated at the beginning was also an interesting facet to me, especially because I spent time in college with twin friends who didn't room together, or particularly like each other. I can see how their relationship evolved the way it did. I get that their mother caused so much stress in their lives; I almost wish that plot line would have had a bit more meat to it -- I wanted more of a confrontation or an apology from the mom and that didn't happen. She just kind of disappeared.<br /><br />Loved the flaws of Wren and Cather's dad. He was human and sad and doing the best he could to raise his daughters on his own.<br /><br />Reagan, Cather's roommate -- what a very understanding roommate. I would be sick to my stomach knowing what was going on between my ex and my roommate, but that added for the angst into the book and had me turning pages wondering how everything would turn out.<br /><br />Fangirl was a great book and as a 44 year old mom, I would have no problem with my 14 year old daughter reading it. Yes, it has some swears and some sexual content, but it was a true coming of age story about a girl who was really unsure of herself and where she fit in. Cath was comfortable living in the imaginary world of Simon Snow, but with the help of her friends, college professor, etc, she was finding her way out, and was on her way to discovering herself. My only wish was that we could spend more time with these really interesting characters! Could there be a sophomore year for Fangirl?

B0049J0DC8|5.0|Great movie for kids! My two year old loves to watch the &#34;cowboy&#34; movie. A classic movie for all ages.
B00A93ENX8|2.0|The title of this message really says it all.  Why in the world would the consideration be given to release an SACD version of an album (especially by RUSH) without 5.1 remastering?  I find it sneaky that \\"SACD\\" is so boldly announced and no mention of the absense of 5.1.  It tricks people that assume SACD means 5.1.  I had to do research to find out that 5.1 is absent and am thankful I did not buy it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like match games, and this is one of the better ones. It lacks the extra star because I haven't figured out yet how to switch game types without first going thru a long string of many nearly identical ones.
B00A287PG2|5.0|easy to read, explains a whole lot more than McKinsey. the history is not told sequentially which makes it less of a historical narrative and more a novel
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Lost parents, lost sister, lost country.  A young boy's worst nightmares realized.  A very dark, very slow read.  I have to say, though, I really enjoyed it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Quick installation, and works like a charm, Netflix and You Tube show with crystal clarity.  More info on which apps use Chromecast would be great.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I live in Maine and read the book on a plane on my way to Minnesota, the two locales in the book.  This fact alone was fun.  But the book itself portrayed a part of US history unknown to me.  It was well written and the intersecting stories of two people, seemingly so different and yet so similar, drew me in.  Couldn't put it down!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Read the help guide part.  Not a game.  I downloaded thinking it was the game not a help guide.  oops
B00A285OOW|4.0|Another great book about the Cousins war from Philippa Gregory. I would have loved for the book to delve further into her life, such as the King & Prince Arthurs death. What she thought of the Infanta marrying Arthur and the Prince Henry after Prince Arthur's death.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is so fun because you get to dodge diffrent obstecals. you also get to reach diffrent goals.. i like this game also brcause you get to collect bannanas...
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|My girls watched this when they were children.  Now I have a grandbaby who gets to watch it on a big screen TV and in high definition.  The colors were brilliant and the sound is beautiful. And the story line is as exciting as it always was!
B005KXT58U|4.0|This was my album to get through my divorce. The pain and rage and will to triumph over such things really spoke to me. The lyrics have great imagery and are performed with passion.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|As with all great writers, it is the way the primary character responds to the world around them and then grows and changes in response that is most interesting.  This is a story of love and betrayal that is told against a galaxy spanning back drop.<br /><br />My favorite author is Banks, and this book reminded me of Surface Detail.  Banks' ships are more interesting as they have more freedom, but it looks like Leckie's might gain some of that in future books.  All in all, this was a great book, a terrific read, and I look forward to the next!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I told my friends what I was reading, the universal response was WHY WOULD ANYONE READ ABOUT DYING TEENS??? But really, it's not about the dying, it's about the living, as Hazel makes clear at the end of the book. These characters are so alive that it shines a light on how often it is that the rest of us (those of us without a &#34;terminal diagnosis&#34;) actually aren't. The complexity of the narrative structure, the writing about what writing means to those who love to read it, those are added benefits, the cherry on top, of a brilliant, moving and passionate love song to life. Please read this book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is truly a page turner. I did not figure out what was going on from one diary enter to the next. Sometimes I was on Nick's side, then when I read Amy's diary entry I was on her side. I did not want the book to end. Very good book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If I had not come late to the party and had been forced to &#60;gulp&#62; WAIT, for more than the few seconds it took to swipe my Kindle screen, I may have lost my sanity. I am heartily grateful for being able to finish the five Wool books in one sitting (literally, I got up to go to the bathroom) and for Mr. Howey's vision, brilliant writing, and gripping tale.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Awesome book. Fun, fast paced and lighthearted. A great look at the 80's from a pop culture prospective. Fun read for old and young alike.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Rare as the tortilla monumental Eva Garcia's living room in Roswell, New Mexico.........this cd sweeps thru the great treasure of mrs. Elvis Costello.  If you don't like it you are probably sick with a heat stroke with gut rot and soon to die.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Before I bought this mouse, I found out that this exact mouse is sold by another company (you can search the internet for \\"8000 dpi mouse\\" and find it). I stuck with the Anker branded one because I know they make good battery packs for phones and other devices.<br /><br />The mouse has a great feel to it. It's not too big for my hands, the braided cord was a must for me, and just seems very sturdy overall.<br /><br />The thumb buttons are placed nicely and are very well defined, so misclicking isn't an issue.  The on-the-fly macro recorder works very well. I switched the default macro-record and macro-play buttons around so it's easier for me to replay a macro. The scroll wheel is well defined. You can definitely tell when you're scrolling, which I view as a big plus. The software for it is very easy to install and understand.<br /><br />The only CON I have for this mouse is the fact that the \\"weight tuning cartridges\\" are a joke. I'm going to try to put some heavier weights from another mouse I had into it to see if I can get it heavier.  It is a medium-lightweight mouse even with the cartridges.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product. For the price you pay, I don't think it can be beat
159514188X|5.0|This was an incredibly thought-provoking book. I read the entire book in one sitting, something that I have not done in a very long time. It was just THAT good.

B008XG1X18|3.0|interesting but time consuming.  my friend really likes it, but I don't understand why.  Cute idea, but too many catch ups for me.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I rated this 5 stars base on the a few factors.<br />* Quality<br />* Price<br />* Assembly<br />* Maintenance<br />* Easy to Use<br />A well trusted company puts out a sturdy and reliable lavalier microphone. Especially, for it price it delivers great for beginners podcasters, radio hosts, anyone just starting recording audio projects. Just put the battery in, turn on the device you are using (camcorder, camera, etc) and switch on the lavalier and you are live to record. When not using long periods of time remove the battery. Other products in the same price range were from companies i never heard of or if they were, obvious they slap their label on a low end product that was never heard of. When given the chance, ask a friend to borrow or use the product before you make a decision.<br /><br />** I am product user, if you want a hi-tech review look elsewhere, so my reviews are short and sweet from my personal experience**

B008G3N71W|5.0|From the start, this erotic didn't let me down. I need my erotic stories to go that extra length, to push the boundaries that not all my partners are willing to cross in real life. This was great escapism - it took me there, exactly where I wanted to go. I'm well into the \\"naughty\\" behaviour that became commonplace in this story, so I was well in my element. If you like your sex a little different from the \\"norm\\" then you'll love this book as much as I did!
0439813786|4.0|bought the book for my grandson who had been looking for months for this book.<br />It will bring him happiness when I give it to him
006178480X|2.0|I think I have read most of James Rollins books. At first i couldn't get enough of them, now it feels like he uses a recipe. A large number of people have to be killed, all the artillery needed is handy, there has to be a world shattering event in which they race against time to become heroes with a little sex added just in case.Oh and try to overcome the reader with shock.<br /><br />Perhaps I've changed but what I noticed in this book was how many people were killed. No emotion about murder. How the \\"good guys\\" Sigma Force, seem more and more like criminals to me, there is no retribution for all the murders. The science was too far out to feel real.<br />This was probably my last read of James Rollins. His head was here but his heart was not in this book.. I'm sorry to write that.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|His writing reads like an adventure novel and his mind is captivating!  I read it in less than 24 hours.  Couldn't put it down.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Great information that you need for healthy weight loss, 40 pounds in my case, but dry and repetative.  Partially intended for doctors, the author intendes to prove his case by quoteing study after study.  This can make it tough for the average reader to get through.

After getting the run-around from Wal-Mart, Target, etc., who claimed they had, or would have this product, it was nice to just click and order it and have it on my doorstep in a couple of days. Just in time for my child's birthday. So she wasn't disappointment!

B0002KZAKS|4.0|I got one of these several years ago, brand new.  Lately I have been reading lots of reviews for gear again, and felt a need to review this mic.<br /><br />Its a really good one for the money, similar to the SM57 or 58.  I now have an SM57, and a 58, both are great mics. The 8500 is good, very similar. I think if you take care of your stuff, and have realistic expectations, then its a good buy. For a time, I only had the 8500 mic for my home recording.<br />I use the 8500 and a Peavey mic now as backups, and mostly use the Shures.<br /><br />FWIW, my mic came in a padded case, with a mic clip, but did not come with a cable.  A lot of mics don't come with the cable, unless its some sort of package deal.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse is a great addition to my gaming PC. It has tons of different DPI settings, profiles and customization to fit everyone and every games' needs.<br /><br />The only thing I have a problem with is the weight of the mouse itself. I wish it was a bit heavier OR they added more/heavier weights so you wouldn't have to sue them all.
0385743564|5.0|I picked up this book because I'm a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson's Epic Fantasy novels, and while you can definitely tell it was a Sanderson book, it's definitely a little watered down for the young adult crowd. Still, I really enjoyed the book, it's a really easy read and very tough to put down once you start getting into it. The basic idea of the book is a very interesting take on Superheroes, something that bears resemblance to a lot of other stories out there, while stile being very unique and different. Ten years before the first chapter of Steelheart, some sort of comet called Calamity appears in the sky, and normal people around the world gain superpowers overnight. The problem is that either almost all of the people given the powers are evil, or that using the powers makes them evil (absolute power corrupts absolutely). This results in an what's essentially a series of apocalyptic events changing the face of the world, as these Epics are free to do whatever they want without any fear of consequence or retribution. The main character (and only viewpoint) is that of an 18 year old guy who was orphaned by Steelheart, one of the most powerful Epics and the ruler of Newcago. In the ten years after his father was killed, he spent every minute of his life when he wasn't working or learning in The Factory (child labor isn't frowned upon when you could be killed any minute by a random Epic) working on his notes on all of the Epics and their possible weaknesses. Now that he's 18 and out of The Factory, he wants to join the one rebel group that goes around the world assassinating Epics. I'll try to avoid any spoilers about the story, but I think that it's safe to say that he finds the rebels and joins them in their quest, supplying them with all of his notes, and his knowledge of the only time Steelheart has bled.<br /><br />All of the characters in this book are great, I really enjoyed all of them, and they each had very unique personalities/voices. The whole group of rebels made for a really interesting team dynamic, making me wish that I could follow them along on more missions. I will say that a lot of their personalities are pretty goofy, and their jokes/banter tends to be kind of goofy and forced, I still tended to chuckle at them instead of cringing. For the story, it's a relatively basic heist/revenge quest, and I figured out a lot of the plot twists early on, but there were times where I was only partially right. I'll again avoid talking about any of them directly, but I just found them to be too obvious, but then maybe that's because it's being targeted at young adults. Related to this, I found the writing to be much simpler than Sanderson's other books, and while this made the book very readable and hard to put down, it also made it a little goofier. The book also sports Sanderson's usual Mormon inspired (I assume) disuse of real swear words, which are instead replaced with made up words. In a fantasy novel, these fake swears make sense, but in a book which is essentially a possible future of our own world, I just don't get how all of our swear words would change (mainly to Slontze and Calamity). Some of the Epic Powers were also kind of unbelievable, which is kind of odd from the master of magic Sanderson, I also don't like how the completely unbelievable ones (Spontaneously turning everything except living animals into Steel) mix with the ones that would be kind of possible/believable (Projected illusions, super strength, superfast healing/invincibility, etc). However, I do really like how all of the Epics have some sort of weakness that makes them vulnerable. I also like the potential of how these powers effect the people that use them, along with what the readers learn about them later in the book (I don't think I can really talk about without spoiling the plot twists).<br /><br />Overall, while this is a simple novel, I just loved reading it, and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good and quick read, especially if you're a comic book fan.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Nice to be able to control with my phone or my laptop.<br />Great picture and easy to move from tv to tv
B009NH6JRE|4.0|The collector edition is amazing and makes you want it, but this is really good as well.<br />Five discs with great content, but next to nothing to make them better than watching them in netflix, and they took forever to get here, netflix had them ready on the 29th
B00AK77WPE|5.0|Great concert, great show by Juan Luis Guerra, the song with Juanes was a great bonus and the sound is very good
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I felt as if I was right there in the mist of everything that was happening to Griet in her new life as a maid. I could feel her pain of leaving her family, her loss of her sister and her disappointment in her Master. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and will read more of Tracy Chevalier's books. I was not disappointed. I have found a new favorite author!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|exactly what was expected
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I read this book with curiosity after reading some of the other reviews. It takes a while to get going, but then it is one surprise after another and keeps you wondering what is coming next. Many have criticized the ending, but I found it was in character with  the way Amy lead her make-believe-life. All in all I enjoyed the story and found it hard to put down once I got into it. A good read!
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Classic movie.  A must have in your collection
B0013D8LG8|4.0|The movie speaks for itself.  If you are buying this now it is because you saw it before and liked it. The rest of story becomes what do you want in picture & sound quality.  You can still see some pixel problems on the fast motion scenes so I give it a 4 star on that account.  The sound is good with 5.1 using Direct on my Amp.  If I did it again I would probably go with a Blue ray addition to hopefully rid the pixel problems.  I'm guessing that because the movie would need to be remastered for Blue-ray we wouldn't have to feel like we were watching a play and the closeups wouldn't show all the actors zits, moles and etc.
0345803485|2.0|I bought this book out of curiosity because everybody in the media was talking about it and I heard references to it at the hairdresser's. I didnt want to be left out of the loop. Very disappointed. It's poorly written....she says &#34; Oh my&#34; in almost every paragraph, he &#34;runs his hands through his hair&#34; ALL the time. Not much substance. To be fair, I only read about 35 pages but it's just about seduction & rough sex..... and he gives me the creeps! Not my idea of a good read.
B0039OC64M|5.0|Excellent movie & acting. Great food for thought, particularly apropos to todays political situation. &#34;Don't believe what you see, believe what I tell you.&#34;

B009HXG9UQ|4.0|Clever, beautifully directed and acted; highly stylized and nuanced.  A movie that stays with for a few days after watching.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I take it with me everywhere, which allows me ease of access to all my reading materials. So convenient to carry everything in my phone. Has all the functions I  need to use.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A very fun and addictive game. Just enough of a challenge to make you want to best yourself. Very good
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works completely as advertised. Turns on my TV and switches inputs....I use it mainly for YouTube videos when I want to quickly blast something on my stereo, and tons of Netflix.<br /><br />More companies need to support this dude for me to give it 5 stars. Plex alone would give me a 5 star review.

B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is a fun match 3 game. I have played this game before online and really enjoyed it! So I was happy to find it available for my kindle. This is a fine game to enjoy while waiting in line or just killing time. O recommend it.
B004EIZCPM|4.0|Love, love this movie. It is one of the best romcoms I have seen in a long time. Totally recommend this movie. You won't be disappointed.
0385349947|2.0|I don't think that Ms. Sandberg offered any insights not already known to women who work hard and are successful. I was hoping there would be more constructive ideas about how to rise above the challenges currently facing women who choose careers, family, and a well-rounded life. Sadly, the book was lacking in this and other ways. I would not recommend it to others.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Lorde's music is beast. From the musical arrangement to the lyrics to the beat to her amazing voice. I can't wait to see how her career progresses through the years
1614270198|3.0|This book was ok but not really I guess what I had in mind. I will probably try and read it again and see if I can get more out of it.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Absolutely loved the second installment of this book series. I just couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the next book
B002ZCY7TG|4.0|It was on my brothers wish list and it sold for a very good price.  I think he really liked it.
0897502027|5.0|Because it's an excellent book, with clear illustrations and superb written material. It really spells out how to practice self-defense techniques in an all-encompassing manner.
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|My brother said that he had heard part of this cd and that he put it on his wish list.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Just what I wanted when I ordered. Read bad reviews about &#34;CONVOY&#34; and had hesitations but these three DVD's but they arrived and are great. Cheers Amazon.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I confess that when I first started reading the Lies of Locke Lamora, I wasn't particularly engaged.  The book's start does struggle with some pacing issues, which author Scott Lynch has admitted, but it is his first book.  The thing is, the book gets so good that it's entirely forgivable.  You will find yourself endeared by the relationship of the devious main character Locke Lamora and his company.  The story entails a confidence scheme that spins out of control as Locke finds himself between a rock and a hard place with the various powers in Scott Lynch's deep and complex fantasy world.  From the towers of the rich to the gritty criminal underground, you will find yourself lost in Camorr (though the characters and author are the most helpful guides).<br /><br />When it was all said and done, I was surprised by how much I loved the book and how much of it really stuck with me.  The detail and complexity are one thing, but the dynamic characters and engrossing story are what makes it lovable.  Those prose is lush and the dialog is clever.  I would say that someone who likes fantasy but doesn't often read it would also appreciate this book.  Folks looking for a lot of magic might be the only ones not quite into it.  It's there, but the real stuff doesn't come out until later in the book and even then it's unique (in a way I think is rather cool).
B000002KXO|4.0|This is one of those albums that while good does not seem to equal the sum of it's parts.  Boasting several hit singles and a number one Billboard position, it has nevertheless always been slightly less favored in FM world.  My view is that it is simply over produced.  It has the sound of a record that has been stripped of emotion, rawness or looseness in favor of certain airplay.<br /><br />On the other hand it's a good album with a MOR pleasantness.  I would love to hear these songs live in the studio before the perfect sheen was sprayed on.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very enlightening.  And I have found a great difference by staying gluten free.. Thanks for having it available to all.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Gives a pretty good picture of what families deal with when members have emotional problems.<br /> My husband read the book and thought it was a bit better than the movie.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Dynamic story and certainly the real life experience is a million times different from the episode version but so far I like what I am reading
B009NNG202|2.0|For some reason I didn't finish watching the story.  Don't know if it was me or the movie. Others may enjoy it.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Awesome read. I love seeing the events from all the characters perspectives. I would highly recommended this book for all to read no matter what your age
B00EIR5N9O|5.0|Beautifully written.  Difficult to read--it makes you stop and think, but Woolf gets into people's thoughts in a stream of consciousness style that is brilliant.
B00AES0AZI|5.0|I have read this before and remember really enjoying it.  Although it was a little bit cutesy reading it this time, I still found it great.  There is not that many books of this genre with a dog as one of the main characters which can keep a reader satisfied.<br /><br />I guess I'm just a sucker for a good dog story.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one (the second book) was so breathtaking and feel good! I love Ana's character. She is so strong and true to herself. E L really does a great job exploring Ana and Christians personalities. This book is so 'feel good'. I smiled the whole book (well almost) :-)
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Excellent Follett book about WWII. Want to continue reading chapter after chapter to see the next thing that is going to happen. Would recommend this to anyone enjoying mystery and adventure,
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Like Water for Elephants, this book moves back and forth in a now old mans life and like Forest Gump, the character steps in and out of improbable yet somehow made believable experiences.  The main character and the people he meets start as stereotypical &#34;charactures&#34; who develop into multidimensional, lovable people in an ever growing circle of friends.  The story is entertaining and charming and I enjoyed it a lot.  It's loaded with important historical events, embellished fictionally with an insider view of recent history.  It's a great and enjoyable read for anyone who is or ever will be &#34;old&#34;.
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|Normally don't rent the HD versions but since watching on a larger screen tonight I thought it would improve the viewing experience.  No so much, HD was grainy and probably with revert back to the normal streams.<br /><br />Movie itself was great, kiddos loved it.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I bought this for a friend who loves and trains dogs, because no one who loves dogs should be without this. By now I'm sure everyone knows the story, but if you just arrived on this planet, Ed Asner is the voice of a grumpy grieving old man who has lost the love of his life and is about to lose his home. He and a stowaway boy are plunged into an exotic adventure which is of course great fun. But the moving part comes from the back story of this grumpy old man, from when he was young and full of vague dreams, then older and in love, through the pain of not being able to have children and the desolation of losing his wife. It is terribly real and it is so surprising to find it in a child's animation. And yet it seems incredibly worthwhile that children should be exposed to the idea that the &#34;old&#34; people they know have real lives with real joys and sorrows. And that even old people have room to grow and love to share. Bring the hankies.

1250012570|4.0|It was a little hard for me to get into this book in the first place--I found it very out of place and disjointing.  I'm chalking this up to the writing style, however, because once I was able to read for a while and get used to it things started to look up.<br /><br />This book really has everything.  It's funny, romantic, sad, euphoric.  It's a story of first love, and it's so believable that it breaks my heart.  Which just shows you how good this book is.  It's written so well it feels like a real story, something that really happened.  To me, these characters are real people, one's I wouldn't be surprised to see walking down the street.<br /><br />This is the type of book I would recommend to anyone, because it's just so hauntingly good.  It's not only first love, which is so so strong, but coming of age, learning just what it means to be a part of life, and everything that you have to lose.

B009GED3HS|2.0|If you have seen the first season you have seen them all.  This show sticks to a pattern throughout the entirety.  The main characters drink, get into some sort of fiasco or dry story that builds toward Ted finding his future wife, the problem gets resolved, but he never finds her, they all drink more, the end.  If it wasn't for Barney Stinson this show would have flopped years ago.  Just my opinion, don't hate me.  ;)
0771008465|4.0|Wonderful!  All the characters from the first two books come together in this final book of the trilogy which moves the plot forward showing us the present situation of the world and how the remaining humans and the genetically altered humans and animals are existing together.  The second book, The Year of the Flood, is the weakest in the trilogy but I very much enjoyed those characters' return in this story.  They were familiar faces and their characters were wonderfully developed in this book.  It was also fantastic to finally get to know the \\"Crakers\\" so well, and a very important character develops from that group.  Tension comes from the threat of three Painballers, gladiator-type survivors from a fight-to-the-death reality show, pre-Apocalypse.  I was pleased to find no heavy emphasis on the eco-nonsense here and found Atwood's vision of her post-apocalyptic world quite plausible.  I always enjoy Atwood's writing whether I'm thrilled with her books or not and this one is a page-turner that kept me glued to the book.  I still think Oryx and Crake is the best of the trilogy, but this is a satisfying conclusion to the story.

1476727651|3.0|I really wanted to like this book and for the most part, I did. A sequel to King's best and scariest novel, The Shining, the book follows an adult Dan Torrance as he begins to get a grip on his alcoholism (begun in an effort to dull his psychic talents) and comes to protect a young girl with an even greater level of ability from a group of psychic vampires, the True Knot, who live off the \\"steam\\" that children gifted with the shining give off as they are tortured to death. That sounds like the perfect setup to a memorable novel, right? And this was supposed to be King's return to all-out, scare-you-silly horror. But somewhere, something went very wrong. The Knot, as they're described, are a great creation, full of scare potential. And they might have been, many years before events narrated in this book. But as they're presented here, they're a dying, dwindling bunch, and a disease they've caught from one of children they've recently killed is sweeping through the group, thinning its ranks further. It's hard to buy that these creatures, supposedly thousands of years old, have survived for so long without coming across such challenges before, but they don't seem to know what to do or how to escape their fate. Couple this with the threat posed by the girl that Dan is protecting, young Abra Stone, a psychic with a level of power that Dan calls a \\"lighthouse\\" compared to his \\"flashlight,\\" and the True Knot simply aren't much of a danger at all. And Dan and his small group never seem to be in any particular danger. Plus there are more than one coincidences at work, including one so large it almost throws everything else out the window. Yet King also shows that he's still very skillful at characterization and Dan, his friends Billy and John Dalton, and Abra are all fully three-dimensional, people we care about and want to see safe. The scenes with Dan and his experiences in AA might seem extraneous to the proceedings, but they're important in fleshing out his character and his essential goodness. Abra is shown several times over the years as she's growing up, surrounded by the love of her parents and her Momo, her great-grandmother. These are the kinds of things that kept me reading, hoping things might get serious for our heroes. But they never really face any challenge when dealing with the Knot. None of them is ever threatened or in danger. And the bad guys are ultimately defeated far too easily, without much in the way of sacrifice. If ever there was a time for King to beef up one of his \\"doorstops\\" of a novel, this was the time. I'd like to see this story fleshed out and bulked up, and the Knot presented as worthy adversaries for Dan and his friends. Ultimately, though I raced right through this one, I'd chalk it up as a bit of a disappointment.his essential goodness.

B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Having read all Gladwell's books this may be my favorite. With impeccable story telling he ropes us in and then begins to teach and challenge long standing assumptions. At times I found myself not totally agreeing with his thesis but the more I would read the more I was challenged to wonder if he was right. I found myself disagreeing instinctually and I believe that is his point. For me the best of authors cause me to question myself and my own understanding of the world I live, he did that in David and Goliath, repeatedly. I am grateful that he has dug deeply into historical moments to offer me a better understanding than the shallow knowledge I had before reading his work. He covers so much ground in such a compelling way that I read it in one sitting and could not put it down. I have a deeper grasp of the power of struggle and the source of courage because of this book. When I finished the last page I was deeply moved and also sad it had ended. Thank you for the gift of your writing and research and most importantly, for your deep curiosity about things we take for granted!
B00D3ZJB1S|4.0|It started for Me with stinkfinger and paranoid. Ok.<br />The album appears to be half Tony/Ozzy.<br />Ok Ok Ozzy I can hear you screaming already keyrieyst!<br />That sums it really....its all about screaming as most artists are<br />currently doing. The songs do match old formats which is nice but are<br />flatter than say \\"Orchid\\", \\"Your no Different\\" or \\"Diary of a Madman\\" which have<br />dimensional force. Ozzy helped out Tony on this one and 13 is an awesome<br />name.

B001N09F7U|3.0|Since I am a regular King fan, I had to read this one.  (I read it a while back- just catching up on my reviews).  It took me a little while to get through this book.  Even though the main character is likeable, I just didn't care about her that much (to be honest, I really don't care about characters that much in a book anyway- I care more about them in movies- maybe I am a more visual person?).  There were a few moments of suspense, but that was all.  I wasn't really expecting a horror novel with this book, and I know that an author continually grows and gets out of his/her genre from time to time, but if you are expecting regular King horror, this ain't it.  It's more like a drama.  Get it and see for yourself.  As far as I am concerned, this is definitely not at the top of my list of SK novels.
B00EP0KYDO|3.0|This movie was better then I thought it would be. The fake accent could have been left out of the movie and Wil Smith could have done a little better acting. He son is a pretty good actor just wish he would do something without his dad to make it not look he got a job because of him.

B0089LOG02|4.0|I really enjoyed the Orphan Train. I had no idea that this had occurred as a historical reality; it was enlightening as well as a little unnerving. The living conditions in the early 1900's or for foster kids today can be frightening. Trying to put ourselves inside the heart or mind of a child who has been abandoned or orphaned is difficult at best. Ms Kline has done a remarkable job.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|if that's appealing to you then this movie will be a favorite of yours like it is mine.  if you're not so much of a mecha fan but still a syfy fan then you're going to enjoy this movie as well and  might even end up taking a liking to mecha(robot/android) syfy.  if you're not interested in syfy and just want an award winning movie about feelings and drama along with earth shattering oscar performances then you're probably going to think the story is cheesy and the acting is mediocre, mainly because you don't get it.

Her creative ideas and tenaciousness in handling sensory issues and social barriers make her a truly endearing character.

Claire Danes' gives a truly believable performance.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|As I've stated in other Baldacci reviews, I've read most of his work, and have been a fan, since his first offering: Absolute Power. Baldacci never disappoints. It would be fun to share a bottle of wine and talk with him about his sources of inspiration for books and characters, as well as his research process. This book, as usual, has strong male *and* female leading characters. The action is relentless. The story lines are complex. The government corruption is troubling. Baldacci's drawing of the (very) young woman stretches credulity, but is nevertheless entertaining. I suppose such wise, but wee, ones exist, but they surely are the exceptional exceptions, rather than the rule; but, I suppose that reality is his point.

B000054OTY|5.0|The print quality is not great, but this is absolutely one of the greatest westerns ever. I remember when it first came out in the early sixties, it received much negative publicity. I can see now that a lot of that came from studio heads who hated Brando and the  critics fell in line. It's a revenge flick with Brando playing the outlaw Rio who falls out with his outlaw friend Dad Longworth played with supreme villainy by Karl Malden. Along the road to revenge Rio picks up a few more bad characters including Ben Johnson who seemed to appear in most of the great westerns of that era. Brando is far from a virtuous John Wayne-type hero, but his characterization of Rio and the other outstanding performances by the co-stars makes the film move at all times. Of course Slim Pickens is in this one as well playing a snake. Forget all the negative reviews you might have read (if you're old enough) when this came out. This is one of the top 5-10 westerns of all time.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a very fast moving game! It shows me how slow my reflexes are! My 6 year old grandson does a better job! I like it though! It's great if your not wanting to relax.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is an AMAZING book about how close the US, and the world, were to at a minimum nuclear disaster, and at a maximum nuclear annihilation.  We find out from this book that nuclear accidents with nuclear weapons were far more common than one might have imagined, including the actual destruction of nuclear weapons in accidents through burning and explosion of the warhead components.<br /><br />The book, as others mention, has two angles: first, the story of a nuclear missile Titan II launch silo accident.  This part of the book is told in riveting narrative, with a fascinating cast of characters and blow-by-blow recollection of their actions and thoughts.<br /><br />The second part of the book is about the Cold War and the nuclear arms race.  This covers everything from warhead counts, delivery vehicle counts, deterrence theory and MAD, and relations between the US and USSR.  One of the key themes in the book is that the US nuclear system might have been, if not its own worst enemy, a close second.  Lack of safety mechanisms on the weapons, poor command and control systems, and a culture of secrecy and denial that exacerbated these problems is related in detail.  The book discusses both how accidents with warheads, faulty equipment in the C&C centers, and other incidents could have easily resulted in either a full nuclear explosion or an accidental exchange of nuclear weapons between the Super Powers.<br /><br />It makes, in my view, the war on terror seem like a relief.

0380729407|5.0|The master of minimalism Ernest Hemingway once said that he would cut the first 50 pages of his books down to 5. Evidently, Bradbury believed in a similar approach. For chapter after chapter he throws one-sentence paragraphs at the reader. That forced my mind to search for missing sentences, which only triggered imagination. His style reached an apex at chapter 31, which read: \\"Nothing much else happened, all the rest of that night.\\"<br />From that point on descriptions and details get longer and the overall creepiness of a carnival from hell come to town antagonizes and disturbs any who continue to read.

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|The movie stands very well on it's own .  The only reservations that I have are the lack of information concerning the eugenics wars that spawned the creation of Kahn and his followers, the &#34;Family&#34; connection ( the closeness of Kahn and his followers) that explains the depth and range of his emotions of rage and hatred.  By the time Kahn was reintroduced into the storyline in The Wrath of Kahn, there had been a lot of character development in the tv series that created the Dread at the mention of his name.<br />I also feel that the closeness depicted between Spock and Jim was rushed for the same reasons.  For those who are not famiar with the entire Star Trek series, I'm sure that this makes the characters feel a little shallow.<br />I have had the pleasure of watching every episode of the entire Star Trek story over the years.  I'm sure that it caused me to expect more depth from this movie.

B00847KFDS|1.0|....after seeing the guest \\"artists\\" on the package. The only thing missing is Miley Cyrus.  Probably the worst mess of a record I've heard in a long time.  The poor performances are only surpassed by the unlistenable audio quality of the thing, compressed, auto tuned, lousy mix, (were the performers even in the same state much less the same studio?). Everything wrong with contemporary (bad) digital recording is here in all it's splendor.  A&R and the production team should be fired.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I know we all have our own preferences, but this Batman movie is my favorite yet to date.  I am a huge fan of the way Michael Keaton versions years ago, but this movie won me over.  I did enjoy Batman Begins, The Dark Knight but in this trilogy In my opinion, The Dark Knight Rises is the best.  The storyline is great, Bane is AMAZING, and the message of perseverance, hope, redemption and justice are channeled to the audience.  The director Christopher Nolan did an amazing job, the characters and acting is great and dreadfully this series of this movie is over with Christian Bale no longer playing Batman.... or is it?  I would rate this movie probably 4.8/5, it is one of my all-time favorite movies now.  In case you havn't seen this I will not provide spoilers, but if you enjoy action movies, drama, superhero movies, or movies inspiring hope and determination you MUST WATCH THIS!  Hope I helped.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If it doesn't work at first  - KEEP READING!  About mid book she explains in detail the things that block.  I have been a big proponent of these concepts and have built a successful company based on them.  However, there are definitely times when it doesn't work and I've needed a lot more information about what causes that.  This book was very helpful with that.  Plus - she has an entertaining way of delivering it.  Fun to read.
0440237688|4.0|Imagine a world where there's no discrimination, no crime, and life's largest decisions are made for you.  Emotions are non-existent, individuality is unheard of, and sameness is celebrated.  This is the premise for the futuristic dystopian society that author Lois Lowry has created in her classic novel, The Giver.  The book closely monitors the actions of a twelve-year-old boy named Jonas.  At age twelve, members of this dystopian society are given their jobs that they will hold of the rest of their lives.  Jonas is selected to be the \\"Receiver of Memory,\\" and to store all past memories before Sameness.  As Jonas takes over his new job, he meets the former \\"Receiver of Memory\\" named The Giver.  The Giver tells Jonas about information regarding to the Community's past.  The Giver basically gives Jonas the power of knowledge, and allows to Jonas to see things like color, feel emotions, and experience a rainbow.  As The Giver shows Jonas these things, Jonas becomes strengthened with the power of knowledge.  Jonas becomes aware that his Community engineered its society to protect against the loneliness, wars, and starvation of the past.  Blessed with this new knowledge, Jonas is inspired to leave his community and break the monotonous life he has led thus far.<br /><br />The Giver is a classic read that forces the reader to use his or her imagination to picture an oddly assembled dystopian community.  Although controversial to some, the message of sameness versus individuality can really leave impact on a reader.  Personally, I enjoyed the read, but was angered by the abrupt ending.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|THe game has potential for being fun as it is fast paced but all the ads kill the good time.
B0061QD82E|1.0|Don't get me wrong, this movie is a classic. I only gave this one star due to it's inclusion of HDCP DRM and the amount of largely unskippable commercials and other garbage that play automatically when inserting the DVD or Blu-ray disc.  Seriously, at least 6-7 minutes of crap before you can even get to the main menu. There is a &#34;fast-play&#34; option that cuts it down to like 2 minutes, but if you happen to miss it, then you're stuck having to watch everything. Ridiculous.<br /><br />The HDCP DRM is a bigger problem, though. I have a dvd player connected via an HDMI-DVI cable to an old (non-widescreen) LCD monitor in my son's room, and it refuses to play since the monitor is &#34;non HDCP compliant&#34;.<br /><br />I ended up having to rip the DVD to my computer, strip out all of the copy-protection and commercials, and then burn the DVD in order to make this playable in my kid's room. I shouldn't have had to do that, though.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Excellent. I love anything by Nicholas Sparks. I didn't particularly like the ending, but it was a great read anyway.
9382951008|4.0|Not quite as good as his other books.  Sometime the story jumps around and is a little difficult to follow.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I. really enjoy relaxing with this game it is fun and easy to play I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to play a fun game.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|We enjoyed Fringe from the beginning to the end.  The characters are great and the story lines and special effects are new and skin crawling.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|If you enjoy the court room drama as well as the office drama that made The Good Wife so wonderful when it began you will love Season 4 as it has many of the same elements as the first season once again.

B005MLOKXA|4.0|Season 2 is better than Season 1.  Season 1 introduces us to the characters and the situation.  Alicia Florrick is more out of her element, more awkward.  Here you see her gaining her footing.  The actress, Julianna Margulies never disappoints.  She's wonderful and this is a great role for her and she's playing Alicia so well.  However, you don't really watch this show (in my opinion, ha, those who watch the show will get that) as strictly a by-the-book legal drama.  The people are very attractive, the stories mysterious and interesting for the most part and the soap opera drama continues from Season 1 with better conveyance of emotion.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I decided to share with my children movies i loved growing up and that i could learn from. They loved it! As for me I loved it as well.<br />Thanks
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like the show, it's a good show.  I just don't think it's a 5 star great show.  Julianna Margulies is a really, really good actress, I've loved her since her ER days,  and the storylines are interesting.  It's soap opera with a dash of realism, just enough emotion, a great cast and a big dollop of soap opera.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Entertaining and made me lol a few times...watched while cleaning...perfect...why do I need to write so many words for this review...never again

0756990696|5.0|Jostein Gaarder made a great thing when wrote this book. The story is amazing and somehow tantalizing. It is about history of philosophy, but it also make the reader think, think hard, and the book put you a step above the common sense.<br /><br />I really recommend it to everyone
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|No instructions as to what to do with collected gold coins. Wish there was a version of this same game for purchase to get rid of the advertisements.

B0016OMFNY|5.0|Roy Orbison. Bob Dylan. George Harrison. Tom Petty. Jeff Lynne. A cross generational, odd musical but stunningly workable combination, they dubbed themselves The Traveling Wilburys and cut this one off, one of a kind album. Each man brought their A-game and checked their egos. Ultimately, \\"Volume One\\" became a surprise hit, going Top Ten and generating a hit single via \\"Handle With Care.\\"<br /><br />Even as odd as the combination seemed, the members all had connections. Dylan toured with Petty and the Heartbreakers, Harrison had just wrapped up \\"Cloud Nine\\" with Lynne at the helm as producer, who had also produced Orbison and Petty. \\"Volume One\\" somehow managed to use the best of each member, making the album a light, fun affair. It's easy to feel the joy the band gets as they plow through \\"Tweeter and The Monkeyman,\\" which is so Dylan, it could be mistaken for a Dylan parody. Or Orbison's ranging vocal on \\"Not Alone Anymore,\\" using that mammoth voice of his to enchant the listener.<br /><br />But the capper is \\"Handle With Care,\\" where each member gets a turn at the mic for an utterly charming piece of rootsy rock. Same with the second single, \\"End Of The Line.\\" Given the amount of talent in the room, it's amazing just how seamless this all is. Lynne's polished production job makes the blending also feel effortless. There weren't many supergroups that could flaunt the title without having a shoving match for the spotlight, but \\"Volume One\\" was that rare triumph.<br /><br />Sadly, Orbison died shortly after the album came out, and the surprise success pretty much guaranteed a second try, but the chemistry was not there and the self-referencing (like \\"The Wilbury Twist\\") became obvious instead of effortless. You can get \\"Volume One\\" without worry, \\"Volume Three\\" is a fielder's choice.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Best sequel ever! I may be biased since Stephen King is my favorite author. But if I am I don't really care.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Another great iron man movie. Just what I expected. Great action with a hint of humor. I just hope another is in the making.

1454901276|4.0|The book starts out as a murder mystery when Glasgow-based detective, Fin MacLeod is dispatched to the Isle of Lewis to investigate a killing that is similar to one he's been working locally. But this second murder is almost incidental because the central plot involves Fin coming to grips with all the previous relationships with people on the isle and trying to achieve some degree of closure on the ones that ended in violence. It's a gripping story and you'll also learn much more about the customs and language of the people who inhabit these barren wind-swept islands off thee norther coast of Scotland.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the love story as well as the erotic parts it keeps you wanting more. The characters are perfectly paired.
0307742997|4.0|On the first snow of winter, a woman goes missing.  Only one trace of her remains, a pink scarf draped around a snowman that mysteriously appeared in the yard earlier that day.  Inspector Harry Hole suspects there is a link between the missing woman and a letter he's received.  The case deepens when a pattern emerges over the past decade; eleven women have vanished, all on the day of first snow.<br /> Nesbo skillfully weaves in the back story of these missing women by individual chapters as the mystery unfolds.  The events are correlated with the election of U. S. presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, a technique that gives the author an opportunity to make some humorous comments about our country.<br /> Harry Hole has a new partner, an attractive young woman detective from Bergen named Katrine Bratt.  There's considerable sexual tension as Katrine is attracted to Harry but he's not interested.  He's still carrying the torch for Rakel who is now in a relationship with a doctor named Mathias.  But somehow, Rakel can't get Harry out of her life for two reasons.  Harry has formed a strong bond with Oleg, her son.  The other problem is that Rakel keeps coming back.  As Katrine tells Harry, \\"Once you have fantastic sex, you have to keep coming back for more.\\"<br /> Harry and Katrine begin making grizzly discoveries of the missing women plus  other related victims.  They think they've discovered the identity of the snowman but surprises keep popping up.  Like me, you probably won't be able to figure it out until you get to the last pages and have to keep going until the very end.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|This album is really breakthrough music for Tegan & Sara.  I believe it has the potential to make them really big stars.  The tracks from start to finish are quite catchy, but yet each unique and not so simple to become boring.  I've listened to the album through about 6 times now and it keeps getting better with each listen.
0345529057|5.0|these books totally bring to life a time , a place and a world not here. George R.R. Marten keeps you engrossed in all of the myriad lives of the kingdoms and time lost to us but reborn in his story. If you want to immerse yourself in another time and place and see this through the eyes of those that populate it then the song of fire and ice is a must read.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Hope to collect the rest of the series for my husband. He never seems to get enough of the show.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Does not work well on Kindle Fire. The keyboard comes up but it is hard to close. There are no instructions for running the program on a Kindle. If you save a changed xls spreadsheet, you cannot open it again and you have to reload the original file from your computer. Very poor and would not waist even 99 cents.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie wasn't what I thought it would be.It starts out fast with a blur of chaos,then slows down to the story.As soon as the 1st person changed,I thought \\"oh crap\\",another zombie movie.I wish someone would make a movie about what is really gonna happen to this country,with over population,total collapse of the economy,riots,marshal law,and the use of the 800 refurbished concentration camps statigectly positioned across this continent.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|the game will not allow me to progress any further then maybe halfway. but the puzzles are challenging. collecting the artifacts was a bonus to the game

B00DY951RQ|5.0|I loved Self Portrait so I adore Another Self Portrait. The registrations are clean and sharop. Bob sings heavenly. The gem is the complete registration of the 1969 Isle of Wight concert. A nod to Bob for this new great bootleg!

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love the world that Cassandra Clare built with its Shadowhunters, Vampires, Werewolves, Magnus Bane (yes, I give him his own category, because he's just plain fun). I love Jace! He's cocky and funny, and very entertaining to read about. He's probably one of my top book boyfriends. Clary is a super character herself.  There is a huge twist! I really didn't see that one coming! Nope, I'm not telling what it is either! You have to read it to find out.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|The white noise app provides a quick way to produce some soothing sounds that can provide a nice background for reading, meditating or simply dozing. It's easy to use, gives you some choices on timing and has a good variety of sounds.

B000IKQMFO|5.0|I have several copies of this movie.  My mom took the first copy and never would give it back.  you have to watch the movie several time to figure everything out.  This movie was made before Downton Abbey. I could do without alll of the sexual content that gives this movie an R rating, but it is the basis for the movie issues.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|It was like the next day. I was very impressed. Also no damage was done to the package at all even though its so small. Perfect sale!
