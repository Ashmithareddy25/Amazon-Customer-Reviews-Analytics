B008D28HYS|2.0|I don't often review, but I felt like something needed to be said to the developers on this one.  First off, I don't care so much about the \\"data mining\\" issue - I'm on a kindle fire, so maybe it grabs stuff directly from the phone, but if you don't want to advertise your accomplishments, then don't do so.  For me it is optional.<br /><br />The puzzles themselves are pretty good.  The easy puzzles are very easy, but difficult enough that I'm certain the later puzzles will be challenging if I can bring myself to ever try them.  The problem I have is the interface.  It is necessary to zoom in for any degree of accuracy, but when I do so, I cannot see the numbers anymore and I have to constantly shift back and forth to see them, which gets frustrating, particularly if the app misreads my intentions and fills in a cell that I didn't want filled.<br /><br />Other apps have solved this problem by keeping the numbers on the screen, even when you scroll.  If there are a lot of numbers for the row/column, they will sometimes hover a bit over the play area, but that's okay as the more important factor is being able to see the information for the row as I am working on the row without having to scroll back and forth all the time.<br /><br />I would be be happy to increase this to a 5-star rating if this ever gets fixed.  And yes, it is worth dropping all the way to a 2-star rating because it is simply that frustrating.<br /><br />The puzzles are great and the app is great otherwise.
0345803493|5.0|When is the next one coming out .I'm really in love wish the next book was already out I can't wait to read it I know it will not disappoint
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Like the title says, This is Fantastic!! It works great and is so much fun to mess with. I spent the whole day that I got it \\"sonicing\\" random stuff, (which is really addicting no matter how childish it sounds XD) I know a lot of people have complained about the durability lacking, but mine seems perfectly fine. Also the light on the top is actually surprisingly bright. Sure in actual light its not, but that's the same for most things. It was able to light up the hall way and my room though(lights were off, but most of my flashlights aren't that good). As for the sound, it is awesome!! Sounds just like the real thing. I was reading some reviews and a lot said it was really quite, but to be honest I think it's just fine. When I first put the batteries in, it was rather quiet, but once I got it working and it had time to actually get warmed up, It got louder. What I find funny is the only thing the light wont really shine on is wood XD  Another thing I noticed was some people saying it doesn't make two different sounds like the description claims. It actually does, ones just the normal buzzing and the other is sort of like some warped sound (no clue how to describe that) There's just not a button for the sounds separately. It alternates between the two randomly. Over all I love this thing!!
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I know a lot of Dream Theater fans have sort of a love/hate relationship for the band. We all love the technical and musically complex side of Dream Theater, that create some of the greatest riffs and melodies in progressive music, yet we also hate Dream Theater's tendency to perform average cover songs, especially live, and of course, LaBrie's sometimes not so pleasant vocals. Well fear not, this performance consists of no cover songs, all the songs are excellent picks, we don't have any songs of their first album and only one song off of Falling into Infinity, which happens to be the best song off the album. Plus LaBrie, while not at his best here, at least does a good job putting energy into the performance, and there are a good chunk of instrumental songs and passages, I'd say LaBrie's only present for roughly half the performance.<br /><br /> We get some awesome songs from Images and Words like Pull Me Under, Awake, and a few songs from Falling Into Infinity and Scenes from a Memory. Although a majority of this album consists of material from Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Train of Thought, which was their new album at the time of this performance. Songs like In the Name of God and Stream of Consciousnesses just have so much energy put forth. Dream Theater does a good job expanding their solos and adding new elements when playing their music live so it sounds different than the studio. In fact, aside from LaBrie's vocals, most of the songs performed here are more enjoyable than their studio versions due to the new edge thats given to the songs. Petrucci really works some incredible solos and scales, Rudess is great on keyboards as usual with a rotating keyboard stand, Portnoy's drumming is on fire, and Myung's bass is incredible. My only real complaint is LaBrie's vocals sound worse here than in the studio, but it is nice seeing him put energy and passion in his voice, despite it not being at its best. I guess a minor complaint is I would have liked to have seen more songs off Images and Words and Scenes like Metropolis Part I, Learning to Live, Fatal Tragedy, or Overture 1928, but I the songs they did perform were still pretty excellent choices, and they definitely put forth an essential performance. Its really one of the few moments live that band really stands out at their best. And its 3 hours long, so we are getting an entire performance of excellent long jams and prog masterpieces. The second CD is kind of a making of documentary which sort of follows the band members around and they talk a little about the tour and how they prepare for it, as well as segments where Petrucci, Portnoy, and Rudess explain their equipment and setup for the concert, and a pretty fun Portnoy drum solo where he gets his fans to interact. This second disc is okay and really just a bonus, but its nice to see at least once. But overall, this is an essential performance and must see for any Dream Theater fan.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Uhm it was different not the typical read I will usually go for...haha. I was still intrigued to know more so I read it. I would choose any of Abbi Glines books over this though.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is very easy to use. The site is very friendly.I would recommend the site to my friends and family.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok but make it too easy for kids to buy coins.but other than that it is not bad overall
067960085X|2.0|So after years of trying to avoid most of the modern classics I decided to break down and read this one. I spotted it by chance a week ago and picked it up figuring that with it being so short it would be a quick read. Plus I'm trying to branch out and try some books that I might not usually give a chance.<br /><br />Sadly I hoped that this book would be much better than it was, yet it never achieved anything more than mediocrity in my eyes. While I did find Holly Golightly to be amusing I just could not get into his writing. To me it was dull and slow. But it seems like the majority of people who have read it do enjoy it. This may be a case of it being a book that just isn't for me.<br /><br />I did enjoy Breakfast at Tiffany's more than I did his short stories which I found to be dreary and poorly written. I did not like how here was a lack of fluidity but then again I am not a fan of short stories in general and I don't think that I will be reading anything else by him in the near future, perhaps in 10 years or so when I'm older I'll give this one another shot.<br />I do hope that despite my review while very short and not very favourable that you give this book a try for yourselves. Far be it for me to hinder people from reading when I think people should be reading more.
030758836X|3.0|this book definitely kept me turning the pages, but I thought the first half was much better than the second half.  All the manipulation between the main characters left me not really caring about any of them.  And I found the ending a bit overdone and disappointing.
1451608659|4.0|I was excited to read this book because I have watched Dominique compete and was so amazed by her ability to compete under all the pressure of the Olympics at just 14.  I knew of some of the things that she described, but not all of them. And it was sad to learn of the difficulties of her life.  But it gave me joy to see that she has been able to go on with her life and make it a good one.  Dom does a good job of telling the truth, but not trying to make it sound like she is out to get anyone.  I love the sport of gymnastics, but know of its demons.  I think it is important to see all sides of it and know what true sacrifices these girls make in order to represent their country.  I enjoyed this book, it wasn't too intense, but showed all sides of the spectrum.
1594200106|5.0|I read this book several years ago and to this day, it is still my favorite book. I love the characters, the thrill and mystery, and Zafon's way with words.
0380807343|1.0|I had such high hopes for this book but when I started reading it those hopes were quickly dashed and now I regret spending the 2 hours reading this book when I could have been reading something that was actually enjoyable!<br /><br />And before you ask no I haven't seen the movie so I am most assuredly not comparing it to the movie adaptation in anyway. Though I do still plan on seeing the movie even with not liking the book at all.<br /><br />I honestly didn't like the book at all and felt that the whole thing was very underwhelming but once again I appear to be in the minority for having this opinion. I don't think that the reason I didn't like this book is because is a children's book because I enjoy reading children's book still.<br /><br />I'm thinking that it was just a simple case of this not being a book for me but at least I finished it even though I didn't like it and I can say that I have read it and given it a chance. I just couldn't connect to Coraline or the way Neil Gaiman wrote the story. I mean the premise was promising but around 40 pages in I kept waiting to be surprised by something and I wasn't. I honestly can't say that I found anything that wasn't completely predictable so all in all this is not a book that I would recommend except maybe to fans of the movie or fans of Gaiman's other novels
B008MEM24S|5.0|Super duper fun. Clever and good although it nagged me to leave a review. :)<br />Good for kids and adults.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Using amazon .com is the easiest most reliable to purchase reading material. The book  fifty shades of gray,was a entertaining story. After the first  several sex scenes, the sex took a back seat to the story line.<br />I plan to always purchase the books I want from amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|ha you stupid dume dumes you only say that because you don't no how to play da infact maybe someone should show you how to play ideot just because you hate your self's get a grip shut up and play ugly UGLY I made my point ummmmmmmmm&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!! ugly.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I have heard some good things and some bad things about this book and the bad things almost made me not read this, however I'm glad that I did. Jaycee's story of abuse and being held captive broke my heart. The way she wrote the book is very much like a journal which is how I bekieve it should be written so if you are looking for something that will win an award for being written in the classic story telling style then you'll probably be among those that do not like it.<br /><br />I have been following Jaycee's story since she was found and reunited with her family. Now I'm not one to pray but I have been hoping for the best for her, her daughters and her family and friends.  Now that she's been found I hope she can find happiness. She deserves it after all she's been through.<br /><br />Despite the horrific sexual, physical, emotional and verbal abuse she suffered during her eighteen years of captivity with Phillip and Nancy Garrido who are monsters in my opinion and should suffer she emerged a strong, powerful woman who has a heart full of love to give.<br /><br />She was raped at 11, became a mother at 14 and again at 17 but she loves her daughters with every fiber of her being and when the Garrido's forced her to become her daughters \\"sister\\" she did so knowing it might save them from harm.<br />I found her story to be disturbing, but at the same time it held a promise of hope. I think that everyone should read it but please beware there are some situations that will disturb you. I even walked away learning a little something about life. Despite what happened to her Jaycee refuses to let hate rule her, instead she looks to a new and brighter day. I wish her all the best in her future and those of her family and friends.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Such an awesome resource to have anywhere you go.  Wish it had some study applications.  This should be a must for everybody.
030758836X|1.0|This book was a disturbing tome with no redemption.  How the author could let the female protagonist get away with her misdeeds is beyond all human decency.  I am sorry that I purchased it and added to the authors coffers.

B00881VLCE|4.0|It was great until you did an upgrade and I lost all my puzzles,  including the ones I paid for.  If I can get those back I rate it 5 stars.

0470901071|5.0|SYBEX does it again.  I completed the full Cisco Networking Academy series for the CCNA and found that Lammle's book was more helpful than all eight of the Cisco books combined.  And to top it off, I just passed the CCNA with an 891.  For those of you who want one book to review for the exam, this is it.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is the favorite game in our house and would give it 5 stars. However, it used to require no permissions and now it has all the snoopy ones. That makes me sad inside.<br /><br />Update: Looks like they listened, because now they only do network access permissions. That's not ideal still in my mind, but it's such a great game I'll let it fly with 5 stars.

B00846REIS|3.0|This book was suggested to me by a friend because I enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey. The writing in this novel is better in ways; its less repetitive. Though to me, its a less interesting and less interesting version of 50 Shades. I just couldn't picture the scenes of this book in my head clearly which tells me the writing is lacking. At least with 50 Shades, I had a clear picture in my head of what was happening. It played like a movie in my head. This book just didn't. I was a little disappointed.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am just getting to know this app, but so far it has been very easy to use and extremely helpful in organizing my notes.

B0084IG7KC|4.0|I guess this is the next best thing since Twilight, so I was looking forward to see it. Having a quite night in on vacation in hotel room, the occasion was perfect. I guess I set up myself to like this movie right from the start, just after hearing so much about it. Unfortunately I have not read the books yet and that it likely the reason I did not understand it fully from the first watch. In the movie, they don't explain clearly how all the districts came about and what each does. Who are those authority colorful people? Or why the kids had to fight instead of adults. That didn't make much sense. Like another reviewer said, next 2 movies should make it all come together. I am looking forward to it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story though about the courage and bravery of Katniss to volunteer to save her little sister, who clearly didn't stand a chance. I think I will get books before the next movie out. Overall, I enjoyed it better than Twilight.
B001AACEP8|5.0|Katy Perry's music has always had an odd lure to it, and this entire album does not cause me to regret falling prey to it.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|Some people Love it. Some hate it. My advice to the people that hate it is this.... Give the first 6 episodes a chance. If you do not like the sci-fi/mystery of the show I guarantee you will fall in love with the character stories. After all.... if you took out the mystery (which was awesome) you still had a extremely good and well written drama. The beauty of the show and the acting gave it a movie feel and tone that will probably never be seen again on network T.V<br /><br />I loved it. If you hated it because you missed a few episodes or came in the middle. Give it a chance. You won't be sorry.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|i enjoyed this movie. gorier than i expected for pg13 but still pretty cool i guess. Would recommend to a friend

B006470HZ6|5.0|Loved this season. I still liked season one better than this, but I was pretty damn entertained nonetheless. Watch it!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|My children (6 and 9) love playing this on the Kindle Fire!It has some game rules we never used, but they picked it up quickly and play it all the time.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I think this is a decent game. I don't like how they want you to spend your own money for items but that is easy to get around.
160309007X|4.0|I liked this. Interesting storyline, cracking artwork, witty and quite original.<br />However the first two League of Extraordinary Gentleman books were a lot better and this suffers by comparison.<br /><br />I often found it harder to get the cultural references in this and understand the characters in the background,<br /><br />This was enjoyable but it is also a little lightweight.  I would still read more comics in this series.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Puts me right out &amp; keeps me there. Nice sounds, fairly easy to use &amp; adjust levels. Many many ambient variations!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I've watched this movie over 8 times and still see things I've not noticed before.  6 times on the big screen at the movies and twice on my 70&#34; Sharp 3D television.<br /><br />The movie is excellent and the 3D effects are awesome.  2D just doesn't cut it for this movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a 3D television.  Amazon's pre-order price was perfect.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is book 3 and last book of trilogy....as far as I know.  The author has a way to keep you interested and captivated and want to continue reading....very hard to put this love story down.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Each new chapter makes you want more.....it's a love story with an interesting \\"twist\\".  Read it with an open mind and don't get hung up on the intimate parts....it's a love story....a woman can change a man!
B008645YH6|5.0|Ever since I started listening to Marina and the Diamonds I have been obsessed with her music. Electra Heart is Marina's sophomore album and although there might be some differences from her first one, this album is just as good and personally my favorite between the two. The lyrics and beats are catchy and have those good old Marina lyrics in them; her wonderful vocals chiming out over addictive pop sounds make for a good time. The album has two major different tones. Songs like Bubblegum Bitch, Primadonna and Home wrecker are feisty pop songs that entail sass and fun while songs like Teen Idle, starring Role and Valley of the Dolls take a darker tone of suicide, sadness and love loss. Most of the deeper songs have relatable and meaningful messages in them, like `Sex Yeah'. So if you're looking for a good album that gives you the feeling to dance, sing or cry I recommend Marina.<br /><br />+++Also the track listing on the album includes: How to be a Heartbreaker and Radioactive
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am on my phone more than my computer and was disappointed that I wasn't able to use my Pinterest account much. Now I will have a hard time staying off it! I had difficulty with the website, NONE with the app on a LG Spectrum.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I find it really interesting that as of this point, people have either given this five stars, or one! So, people loved it, or hated it. I LOVED it. I thought it was brilliant, had spectacle without detracting from the singing, and told the story in a new and exciting way. I have several friends who are \\"Ring Fanatics\\" (one did his dissertation on it) and they loved this production too. I love that they pushed the boundaries of live performance technology, and in my opinion, they had a ringing success. The projections look gorgeous on the BluRay, better than in the movie theatre. WAGNER'S DREAM IS INCLUDED IN THIS BOX SET AS A BONUS.
B0041VV03A|3.0|Very interesting movie with a lot of suspense and a curveball ending.. Not for everyone, or every audience. Very creative plot line though, very out of the ordinary and original. Some scenes not for the faint of heart.

I have tried to fix and use it again after that numerous times but it failed to play what i had chosen to download from youtube. Some one please tell me how to fix this problem.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the books i listed above.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|\\"True Romance\\" is a true classic in many respects. For one thing, it's one of the best films directed by the late Tony Scott, younger brother of Ridley Scott. For another, it's one of Quentin Tarantino's best screenplays. But in the end, its greatest strength is the cast; so many people offer such fine performances that it's almost frightening.<br /><br />Chief among them is Christian Slater, who simply gives the performance of his life as pop-culture-geek-turned-coke-hustler Clarence Worley. Matching him for power and bravado is Patricia Arquette, who's always good but who's never been better than she is here. The supporting cast is, almost without exception, unforgettable: Dennis Hopper as Clarence's father, Saul Rubinek as a sleazy filmmaker, Christopher Walken as a mobster, Gary Oldman as a pimp/drug dealer, Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as cops, Michael Rapaport as Clarence's friend and aspiring actor, Dick -- and finally, Brad Pitt as Floyd, Dick's stoner roommate. Pitt is brilliant, offering comic relief to the film's hail of bullets and shotgun blasts.<br /><br />Scott's direction is as sure and scary as the roller coasters featured in one segment of the film. One minute you're giddy with laughter, watching the proceedings here, and the next, you feel like you're careening downhill at 90 mph.<br /><br />Yes, the film is a thriller, but it's a thriller with considerable mind and heart. Intellectually, it goes far beyond most genre material, actually daring to ask questions such as, \\"What constitutes true happiness?\\" Is it money? Career success? Or does love really conquer all? And the heart of the film is, indeed, the subject of love itself. How far would you go for someone you loved passionately? Would you break the law? Would you kill for them? Would you die for them?<br /><br />This is also a film you can watch over and over again. There are some great lines that beg to be heard more than once, and some visual moments that are no less than overwhelming, including the final shoot-out, which is as violent and crazed as anything ever put on the big screen by Sam Peckinpah.uding the final shoot-out, which is as violent and crazed as anything ever put on the big screen by Sam Peckinpah.

B00005JLZN|5.0|I found this movie very moving. I'm a bit undecided on the death penalty and I have to say this movie did not clear anything up for me, despite its obvious anti stance. (Its lack of showing any arguments whatsoever for the other side was its one flaw. The best movies about big debates let the viewer make up his or her own mind.) However, I feel the movie did make its point... in a certain way. You absolutely had to admire the dedication of the main characters. (Well, I've read the negative reviews which said they came across as nutcases, but David Gale gave up years of his life to his cause.) The only problem I saw with the twist at the end was that pro-death penalty advocates could argue that it was done on purpose. But they definitely made a statement, and you can't argue that.<br /><br />You will never forget the twist at the end. It was a big shock, if you didn't see it coming. And yet, the movie has re-watchability.<br /><br />The only other flaw I felt the movie had was, like so many movies today, they thought they needed to have not one but two explicit sex scenes. Well, the \\"rape\\" scene wasn't really explicit. But it was nasty and gross. Why?? Do people really enjoy watching these things? Yeah, I know some do. But they can go buy porn if they want to watch it. We don't need it in regular movies so all that is left is Disney (for now anyway). I read enough complaints here on Amazon to know sex is not as necessary to sell as they think it is. If you are familiar with old movies, you are aware that things that happen off-screen or are implied can be just as powerful and compelling when in the hands of talented directors and actors.
1936719010|5.0|I will admit that the premise of the book is, for all intents and purposes, unequivocally simple.  However, if everything were as simple as stating a title, people would be doing amazing things every day.  The first step to achieving anything is to, well, do the work.  Putting in the effort, and most importantly the time, are fundamental in achieving any goal.  There isn't any magic formula to skip this integral step, and many people have a hard time accepting this fact.  If you read the book, and claim to \\"get nothing out of it\\", then you need to read it again, because you missed a lot of important information.  I would say this book, along with \\"The War of Art\\" should be required reading for anyone who has ever pursued a dream.  It's not flashy, and Pressfield will not blow smoke up your rear.  If you want someone to tell you that you are awesome, then look elsewhere.  All you will get in Do The Work is the truth.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is great. all the action you need boiled down to a simple control scheme. its starts off slow but once it gets going it really gets going!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is one suspenseful, fast paced book.  Many times I found myself wondering where it was going, while being gripped by the different story lines. I love Blake's other work but this one was a particularly fun read.  I didn't want to put it down and when I did, I kept thinking about what was going on and how it all tied together. Great job Blake!  I can't wait for your next one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i enjoy playing the game but some of the controls are to slow. it makes it almost impossible to play certain games and beat them to get points.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game was well made. I enjoy playing this game. My kids like playing this game as well. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B008D28HYS|1.0|Why such unnecessary permissions! Why do you need my phone number and to open network sockets (internet access)?  Will not download what might be a decent game.
B007VGXS8M|4.0|Lots of reviews are complaining about crashes and the \\"black screen of death.\\" Well, I have not had one single problem, and I have completed the game in full. I have taken one star away because the game sometimes hides books and characters behind trees and other characters so much that you can't even see them, and it can become repetitive toward the end. Overall, however, it was a good time-killer on the plane and during downtime at work.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and super addictive.  I have finished all 600 puzzles.  Are there plans for more?  Would pay for more puzzles.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the books. Have the kindle edition. Read most on my phone. Have them with me anytime any place will read over and over
B0054JZC6E|5.0|deffinatly reccomend getting this app! fun to play and helps pass the time so many games to chose from and all of them are great fun!! :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I first started this book I wasn't so sure if it was for me. The first story was ehhh ok, but once I got into the second story I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next . The story was very well written. I have to say reading a self published book without a million errors is rare but makes for a much more enjoyable read.  I fell in love with Jules and Solo, and I can't wait to see what's going to happen next!  This is something I think everyone can enjoy and will be recommending it to everyone I know who enjoys a good read!
B007712XAU|5.0|I began watching this series in Season 2.  Enjoyed it so bought both in anticipation of Season 3.  Love it!
B008D28HYS|5.0|this is my first review.  my sister in law introduced me to this game and I tried to find simular games but nothing comes close to this game.  love it<br />it is what I do when I am not chasing my 4 children around.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this was my 2nd app I installed when I got my kindlefire. It is awesome! No bugs, no freezes just flows smoothly across my device. I am reviewing now because of pinkbird! She is my FAVE! Please make more levels on Back to School and make more girl birds please!
0765324849|4.0|This was a good book. If you like the game you will like the book. I recommend it to any gamer
030758836X|2.0|I picked up \\"Gone Girl\\" based on its good reviews. I was disappointed by the book specially the end. First half is boring and slow, but the second half is better. I was not hooked to the book and took over three weeks to complete the book. I was bored with the book, so I read even some other books in the middle. The plot is new, but slow speed and abrupt and unconventional ending made the book uninteresting for me. Book could have been better, if few pages from first part were dropped and had a better ending.<br /><br />This book is overhyped, and I do not recommend it.
1600597963|5.0|Beautiful book, lots of pictures and ideas.  It has great new ideas to bead and easy to complex beading patterns.  Good directions and illustrations.  I really enjoyed it.  Great Amazon price.
B004QSQML8|5.0|Finally! I love this movie. I'll talk about everything.<br />The directors cut- the second cut of Legend. It's pretty good, but the ending is just plain O.K. It's good but confusing.<br />The theatrical version- this version has more backstory and more shots and best of all a better ending. Overall I like this one better.<br />The bluray- the bluray has all the DVD features e Celt the DVD-ROM ones and it looks really good.<br />Get this now. Please?
B0033807E0|4.0|Each new book that I read in this series is better than the last one. This is probably because I'm getting to know the characters a little more each time, and I have some back stories about them to reflect on from the previous books. As usual I'll try to keep my thoughts spoiler free.<br /><br />Rick Riordan has once again cleverly entwined the mythical world of demigods into the modern world in such a great way. I really liked the concept in this book. The Labyrinth is an amazing setting and is so mysterious. It's a place that has so many possibilities and potential for adventure, that I hope we haven't seen the last of it.<br /><br />Percy is once again on a mission that is full of danger and humour, to stop the baddies from passing through the Labyrinth and into Camp Half-Blood. Aside from the main characters, a number of others have carried over from the previous books. They have added some interesting new sub-plots to keep an eye on and I'm guessing that these characters will have pivotal roles in the next book. I have to say, that I found Nico quite annoying, but I put that down to clever writing that has created a character that is triggering my emotions. No doubt, the next book will build on his story and I will hopefully understand why he is like he is, and why he annoys me so much. Privately, I'm also suspicious of one/more character/s, but I'll let the next book prove me either right or wrong.<br /><br />The Battle of the Labyrinth is another great instalment in the Percy Jackson series. I'm keen to get straight into the next and final book to see if everything turns to rotten eggs, or if the world will survive. I'm confident I know which ending it will be, but it's the journey that fills the books that we love to read, not just the ending.
B002KEDQJQ|4.0|Dense, cerebral, and bone-crunchingly satisfying, this seminal cult classic adapted to screen quite successfully. Both an homage to the comic hero tradition, and an indictment of our societal bent towards hero-worship, this story pulls off the unique trick of being both the object of interest and its own reflection. Good thinking fun!
B00846REIS|5.0|It starts out a little slow but after the first few chapters you can not but it down!!!!!  If you liked 50 shades you will like this!!!!!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|British filmaker Ridley Scott goes back to the origins of the Alien saga to presents us what he really mastered. period.
B005HES3MG|5.0|This two part episode is one of my all-time favorite Star Trek episodes. Some of the comic bits, like Picard hitting on the landlady, shouldn't be missed. It also features Mark Twain, who is sure Data is like his Connecticut Yankee, but finds otherwise.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can't remember when I've read anything written this atrociously. The characters are badly developed and not believable - really, she's a 22-yr-old virgin, and he's a well-endowed bazillionnaire with a perfect penthouse, a lot of linen shirts and a helicopter? The dialog is awful and repetitive, and the sex scenes are ridiculous and repetitive. Some phrases are repeated so often it becomes comical (he cocks his head to one side, his lips quirk up, she bites her lip, his lips quirk up again, she peeks up at him through her eyelashes), so I gave it one star for entertainment value. I might have been able to appreciate this book for that entertainment factor alone, but the pervasive use of specifically British-English language by characters who are supposed to be American drove me absolutely batty. Who edited this, and what were they smoking?<br /><br />The only thing the author got right is the protagonist's uncertainty in exploring a new relationship with someone who has the potential to harm her if something goes wrong - and the absolute necessity for trust in BDSM. I gave this book another star for that authenticity, but if you want to read about BDSM, you're much better off with the Sleeping Beauty series or any number of well-written, professionally edited books. This one is nothing more than a bad romance novel with a little kinky-ish stuff thrown in.
B008COD5UI|1.0|Didn't get a chance to watch it. Started it , wanted to watch with my son. He never watched it with me and the 48 hours ended without me watching more than 10 minutes of the movie.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|What made me download this was the big FREE button. Im gonna bet in six months this game will still be on my phone.....good job TBS games...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is great for younger kids. it doesn't keep my intrest. I like beer pbr for me tonight and that's 20
B008D28HYS|5.0|Excellent game both this color version and the black and white one.  Color adds more complexity and challenge to the puzzles and you need to use different approaches to solve them.  Very good controls in the game that allow for quickly filling squares and zooming in and out of puzzles. One of my favorite apps that has a home on my start page.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a great game that's well worth the price if you enjoy problem solving and creative thinking. Try the demo, figure out how it works, and you'll buy it guaranteed.
B0053O89K6|5.0|Universal chose wisely when they put seasons 6 - 8 of \\"House\\" on Blu Ray.  OMG, the difference in audio is very noticeable (a la, opening song/edit \\"Teardrop\\" (Massive Attack).  And, all the other great House toons (check YouTube for some examples - GREAT STUFF) sound extraordinary on Blu).  Video is EXCEPTIONAL.  The seasons, the lighting, the facial blemishes (not many!) all enhanced in Blu.  With the great prices on Amazon, no reason not to get the best-in-digital format.  So, question is, will UNI go back and put seasons 1 - 5 of \\"House\\" on Blu Ray and cement the legend?  Please do!!!  Your fan base is ready now.  Wait too long and you'll lose the opportunity.
1603420398|5.0|This book help me to figure out how to read the symbol, so easy to read & understand. Love it !!!!!!
B003L77G06|5.0|This is a solid show that gives us a breath of fresh air from the mundane repitition that we currently have on televison. I appreciate the diversity of families and ages, and the humor is spot on. I was worried that they would lose their spark from season 1 since this is such a different show, but I'm glad that they haven't.<br /><br />I also appreciate all of the extras that they apply to the DVD. We as viewers love the show so there's no guessing to why we purchse the entire season, but it's an added bonus to see some of the deleted scenes, bloopers, etc.<br /><br />A worthy buy.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|Just discovered Castle in 2012! Watched all 4 seasons in a month. Funny, romantic and great charcters. Oh, and the plot is pretty good too.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is such an amazing show, I cannot even get over it. I have to say that I like season one a bit more than season two, but I guess for some that is to be expected. For a first season the work is really impressive, and I hope to see more seasons to come.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you enjoy Mario you'll love this game. simple but addicting. has left/right ccontrol and up control right on the screen. great game.
B005TZFZJC|4.0|This is a pretty solid album from Rihanna. Others have gone in great detail track for track, so I will do a quick run through of my favorite tracks (in no particular order):<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00689IM02 You Da One [Explicit]]] - One of my favorites from the get go, and still one of my favs. It's a very smooth track that is more than just pop to me, and is something that I can listen to over and over. It isn't too much from Rihanna; she gets it straight in the pocket.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00689J6UC Birthday Cake (Interlude) [Explicit]]] - I think the shortness makes this the more sweet. An EXTREMELY catchy combination of beat and lyrics. This is probably why it was one of the most popular tracks of the album, and why fans wanted an extended/normal length of the song.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0068CAU18 Talk That Talk [Explicit]]] - This song got to me. She sings this song with cockiness and a lot of attitude. I could do without Jay Z's verse to be honest.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00689J6KW Cockiness (Love It)]] - Song explains itself.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0068C9XH0 Where Have You Been]] - I absolutely did not like this song at all the first few times I played it after I got the album. But since the radio stations were inundated with this song, I got used to it. Now I really do like it, and it has been made one of my favorites off the entire album.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0068CB0EE Red Lipstick [Explicit]]] - A song I could live without to be honest (which is probably why it is on the deluxe version), but there are moments where I find myself listening to it. It's very different from the rest of the tracks. Definitely a B side.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|very addicting even for a young adult. it keeps the interest and reminds me of other games ive played where characters have to be cared for
B0050CQY1W|3.0|This was a pretty good album to me. Everyone has standards and opinions, and as an artist she has the freedom to  change her sound or experiement. But this was an average album to me. I say average because I don't find myself listening to a lot of the tracks all the time. But this CD 'gave my sister life' enough for her to purchase it the week it came out, so I must  give credit for that.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br /><br />Love on Top<br />Party<br />Count Down
1609611543|5.0|Good marketing $$$$ but really BAD for health - well they make more money off of unhealthy people than the healthy. \\"Eat plenty of healthy grains\\" - A LIE - yes I'm very angry & outraged over this LIE plus that around 1986-7 iodine which is essential for health [read Dr Starr, Hypothyroidism Type 2- check yourself!!! p.17] was removed & the goitrigen bromide added AND they know what they're doing just like w/ fluoride [goitrigen-suppresses thyroid & metabolism] in the water & tooth paste. I eat much less grain (Oat Nut Bread) & back to butter, eggs, ham, sausage, beef, fish while losing wait!!! After correcting my plague state hypothyroid [Thyroid-S.com -2wks US)condition there's no worry of heart etc as a proper body metabolism level prevents it naturally. Grains are hard to digest but the green revolution GMO grain has stuff the body has never seen before - the high gluten content goes to fat storage. Stockmen know grains fatten animals up for market but fattening us leads to degenerative conditions plus you must eat over & over,snack-snack as it doesn't stick w/ you long. Read the book by Dr Starr via amazon as the thyroid is The Master Gland of the body plus the majority in the US is malnurished - unreal but also every new born infant has an average of 200 toxic chemicals in them. Get up to speed on Lugols 5% Iodine - Dr Bernstein, Iodine - why you need it & can't live without it(amazon).

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its very handy!<br />I use everytine instead of a real calculator.<br />I recommend it for EVERYONE.<br />And I think its fun to use when I'm bored like using Temple Run! :D
B005FFW46S|5.0|Absolutely brilliant; possibly the best in the sequel \\"Watch\\" series. Although that would be hotly disputed among the Pratchett acolytes I found Snuff to be a great change of pace for Vimes to be out in the country and having to rely on others local knowledge. Great yarn; I highly recommend it to all.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|My husband teases me about reading this book, he says it's the only book he's seen me be able to stay awake and read at night, most books put me to sleep!<br />This book is fun reading, everyone would love to be married to Fifty Shades!
B004T32SOK|4.0|I have other cloud storage apps but this one is by far the best. Easy to use interface, simply well done.
0345803485|1.0|All the characters are insipid.  It takes skill to imbue one's characters with intelligence and believability.  Both are lacking.  There is nothing erotic about banality.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I had been using the free version for about a year. when the pro version was the app of the day of course I had to get it. I have a really hard time getting up in the mornings, the way I have my alarms setup it forces me to do 3 math problems to snooze and 5 to dismiss. so I a have to be some what awake if not it will not shut up. it very customizable from doing math problems, shaking your phone, having to enter captchas, I like playing my own wake up play list. for me its a life saver I would have a hard time living without it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have been playing this for a while and I love it! it gets very challenging and you can get stuck on one or two puzzles but if you come back, they are easy! I definitely recommend this game! its quite addicting!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun games to choose from. Pretty cool games, some are challenging, others pretty easy. I've enjoyed it so far no complaints.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Movie was fantastic, and frankly better than all of the other Alien movies by a mile, perhaps with the exception of the original.  The 3D was fantastic.<br /><br />I love how people complain about \\"unrealistic\\" things in sci-fi movies.  Don't listen to the haters.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game so much it is just so much it is so fun to play this game so much
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|This is (like previous 24 Series) a thoroughly rumbustious piece of entertainment but also designed to think about the reality behind the propaganda and outright lies on the various news channels. Fewer 'I love you. I love you too' thank goodness.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Flimsy, won't stay on your head and they have lousy sound.  Zero stars maximum.  I can't believe Sony would actually put their name on these.
B008D28HYS|1.0|I'm not going to make a lengthy review about how this product steals your data that it does not need.  There are plenty of long reviews that do that.  short and sweet this game would be great but sells your info.  I can't get behind that.
B008OOYALE|5.0|all the people who said it freezes it dosent ur liars I got it when it first came out and I have been playing it since then its fun to

B005SS2QXS|4.0|I haven't dropped the iphone since putting the protector on so I can't speak to it's effectiveness in that regard. The feel is tacky enough to keep it in place in my shirt pocket although that same feature makes it awkward to put the iphone IN my pocket in the first place.
1416972242|4.0|Given the fact that I actually didn't like City of Bones that much, I was pleasantly surprised that City of Ashes was hard for me to put down. Granted it had to do with the Luke/Princess Leia relationship going on.. that part of me wants a solution and the other part of me wishes it stopped at City of Bones. I also didn't like the back and forth between Simon's plot line, it could have been toned down a little. Overall, I enjoyed City of Ashes and can see why The Mortal Instruments Series is SO talked about. The ending opened up another big plot line for City of Glass, to the many other plot lines that need to be resolved.<br /><br />More of this review here: [...]
B008D28HYS|1.0|Before I move on in describing this app, please allow me to get one thing out of the way.<br /><br />Scoreloop. The name of this data mining software says it all! It is the equivalent of OpenFeint, if not worse! I'm not going to get into all of the specifics as to why I think you should run away from any app that uses Scoreloop unless you know how to protect your device in every way possible. However, for those that intend to download & play this game, I highly recommend you DO NOT join Scoreloop & if possible, please...Turn off your Wi-Fi or put in Airplane Mode!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />  This is a comment that I made in regard to someone who couldn't understand why so many were making such an issue out of this app's permission requirements. Hopefully,  this might help to shed a little light on the subject:<br /><br /> It is not the apps' permissions that cause me to believe it is data mining. It is their admission of using Scoreloop..a well known data mining software used in apps to keep track of online scores, etc. Check out their Facebook page & read what Scoreloop ADMITS to doing with YOUR information using their software that is INSTALLED with THIS app right now!<br /><br />Ok. Moving on now...<br /><br />CrossMe Color contains puzzles known as Nonograms. Do not confuse NANOGRAMS with NANAGRAMS or NAMORAMS. (NANO) GRAMS are entirely different from them.<br /><br />For those that are familar with the popular puzzles of Sudoku; they may recognize another Japanese puzzle known as, Nanograms. Nonograms are also known by several other names, such as, Japanese Paint by Numbers, Pixel Puzzles, Japanese Crosswords, Griddlers and numerous other names. They've also been called Paint by Sudoku and Binary Coloring Books but, those names do not describe the puzzles correctly.<br /><br />With Nanograms, you have a puzzle in which cells in a square grid need to be colored or left blank in accordance to the numbers given on the side of the grid. Solving the puzzle reveals a hidden picture. Nanograms are often black and white but, in this app, the number clues are colored to reveal the color of the squares. Personally. I feel having color in a Nanogram puzzle makes things much more challenging and, CONFUSING at times! For example: Having two different colored numbers may or may not have a space in between them. And lets say you had a black four followed by a red two. Thid could mean four black spaces, some empty spaces, and two red spaces, or...... it could simply mean that four black spaces followed immediately by two red ones. ??? This may be why many people, including myself, become so engaged with these puzzles. Many find Nanograms to be quite addictive. Especially the puzzles you'll find in CrossMe Color where color is involved; adding to your frustration...err.....I meant, challenge!<br /><br />&bull; Pinch to Zoom In or Out<br />&bull; Easy Step by Step Tutorial Game<br />&bull; Option to Skip for the more Novice players<br />&bull; Over 150 + CrossWords/Nanograms<br />&bull;The Promise of More Puzzles to be Added in Future Updates<br /><br />CrossMe Color requires these Permissions:<br /><br />  &bull; Read Phone State & Identity -Device ID for SCORELOOP<br />  &bull; Discover Known Accounts - Users name for synchronization<br />  &bull; Network Communication- Full Internet Access<br />  &bull; Hardware Controls- Control Vibrator<br />  &bull; Extra- com.android.vending.BILLING<br /><br />If you enjoy this type of challenging puzzle solving & you feel you're protected from or, you're just not at all that concerned with the Scoreloop warnings that have been more than THOROUGHLY explained by top reviewer, (read reviewer: jjceo 's last 2 or 3 reviews, if you haven't read about the DANGERS of Scoreloop) , ...then, check this app out.This is a great puzzle app. You wont be disappointed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can only give this app 1 star due to the fact I personally feel this app is unsafe to remain on my device. I will uninstall CrossMe Color & place in the Cloud. Perhaps the developers will seriously reconsider their decision to include Scoreloop & provide a new version for FREE as a replacements to those of us who have downloaded this one. I really would like to try solving these someday...tall CrossMe Color & place in the Cloud.

1416972250|4.0|WOW! Talk about a lot of information and action. I liked City of Ashes but I loved City of Glass! The resolution between Jace and Clary's situation was great to finally have and although you knew if there was going to be that plot line, that there would be that kind of solution. You just didn't know how and I kind of liked how Clare wrote it and brought that plot into the book.<br /><br />Click Here For More: [...]
0345803507|5.0|I found this to be the most salacious series I've ever read. None the less, it is a good story and<br />held my interest so much that I hated to put it down.  I am glad that there are three books because<br />one was not enough.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Fell in love with Downton Abbey season 1 and purchased DVD then watched season 2 and same response,  Put video on my wish list even though price was right  for purchasing.  Then when reviewing my wish list, I saw it in the line-up and decided to purchase Downton Abbey along with other items.  This is one of the best of BBC productions--so well-done and the acting is superb.  Looking forward  to season 3 to watch and to purchase video when available.  I have to reiterate because I say it in all my reviews, Amazon is the best when it comes to availability and price.
0439023513|5.0|It was the best ending to a trilogy I have ever read. It was real and it was raw. It wasn't an happy ending. It showed the true inhumanity of war and ended with hope for a brighter future. Sadly, what this trilogy describes isn't far from reality for people across the planet. Many of them look at us like the frivolous people from the Capitol. I truly loved it and hope it makes people stop and think about some of the hateful things we say and the awful actions we take at times. I have never wanted to reread a series after completing it but there was so much emotion and so many lessons in this series that I will definitely reread it in the near future.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|if you like opra or not, you will like ths cd. Very good and I suggest it to everyone for an uplifting day<br /><br />so good I bought another title and it's good too
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun and addictive.  Like the challenges it gives you.  Great game to play with all the different terrain you have to go through.
0739352989|5.0|This was one of the best reads in a long time. Really enjoyed the romance and the spice in these books.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|It goes without saying that political junkies will love The President's Club.  But what is unanticipated is the revelation that these people elected to our highest office are, at the end of the day, just men.  We've all known men like them and can see both their humanity and their frailty.  And just from an informational point of view, revelation follows revelation.  Who knew that Herbert Hoover played an important role in what became the emancipation of Europe in the form of the Marshall Plan?  I could go on and on but that might spoil it for the next person who reads this excellent work.  I have already recommended it to everyone I know.  My only regret is that there weren't journalists like Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy around from 1783 on.
B005HSL626|4.0|I have a kindle fire... and this app works fairly well kn my fire.. my siblings love it. Only problem is that it freezes sometimes in the middle of a game... sooooooo that is why I only gave it 4 stares otherwise... worth 5 stars im my book..  BellaButterfly073012
0385344228|1.0|I can't review the plot or the characters.  I found the language so offensive I stopped reading after page 32.  Very disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|i just started using it and i really like it and love that i can see where i was so if i mess up i dont have to start over!
B0088W8PLS|5.0|Spoilers included:<br />This episode is unique, in my opinion. I'll state this now, in case I'm mixing up episodes. I have seen this but I'm reviewing after not having seen it in a while. So, don't be to hard.<br />The whole idea of Teyla having an alteration to be a Wraith for the time being is really interesting. Especially how Todd manipulates events to his wants. I do enjoy Teyla's use of her authoritative position at the end where she warns Todd about her coming back in the event that he does something that she would not want him to. She can be very intimidating when she wants to be.<br />I won't say much more, but I'll give good points on the creativity of the episode and the acting. Teyla, the actor playing her more specifically, did an excellent job. I can't imagine dealing with having to put all that make-up on.<br />However, I'm going to stop there, as I'm not really one to delve into the actors themselves, other than to rate them as something along the lines of good or bad.<br />Anyway, the episode was very good. It put Todd in a position of power whilst taking down the Queen. However, even though the Wraith to Human potion, as I'll call it, didn't get to go into place, I think it flows with the episodes. With it, it would cut the series short, and that would put a downer on our want for more.<br />So, the Wraith war continues. Good episode. I hope people continue to enjoy the series.<br />Just to note in ending, I'll apologize now if any of this information is out of place. As I pointed out in the beginning, I haven't watched this episode in a while. I wanted to write a review and give stars to this episode so that people would know it was good, instead of just seeing one star.<br />Ok, hope you like the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it, then loved the second one more, and the last one the most.  I don't really care what anyone else thinks.  My friends read it, and loved it, too.  It did what a book is supposed to:  transport you somewhere else.  For all the ones that say it isn't \\"well-written\\" keep pretending you've read Shakespeare and understood it.  E.L. James wrote on a level everyone can understand--reading her books was like listening to a friend tell a story.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is great, but you have to spend actual money to get the game to go at a pace fast enough to keep you awake! I give it 5 stars despite the mentioned downfall.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was the single craziest book I have ever read.  I kept wondering how it could get any crazier, the things that went on--I can't even talk about it without giving it all away.  I honestly could not believe the amount of crazy at the end.  It was well-written, but the plot is just so all over the place you never knew what was quite going on until almost the very end then that throws you for a complete loop.

B003Y5D776|3.0|I bought this so I could encode some of my old LPs that are not available as MP3s and I will say that it does work. But there is a lot of noise introduced. Now this could be caused by my old turntable but since the noise seems to come and go when I move the interface around I tend to think this device is just not properly grounded or shielded. But for about $25 it's not bad and it does work. With the proper software and noise reduction you could probably clean up the recordings if you wanted to spend some time on it.  I think I will look around for a better interface for my records but for someone who just wants to hook up a mic or a cd player (or tape or whatever) this does work, it's just not what I would call \\"professional grade\\" equipment. But do you really expect that for this price?
030758836X|5.0|If you read books to study the human condition, than this book is worthy of a PH.D in what it means to be human.  Never before have a read such sharp insights into what it means to be in a relationship.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn nails what it means to be dysfunctional, which we all are to one extent or another, but she never condemns her characters for their faults.  Instead, Flynn shows them for what they are, warts and all, and then dares us to love them.<br /><br />It's not easy to love Nick and Amy because we come to know them so well, but isn't that what being in an intimate relationship is all about?  If marriage were easy, there would be no divorces, but in truth having someone know you to your very bone marrow, means that that they just might use your weaknesses against you in the power struggle that is a marriage.<br /><br />No one admits it, but Gillian Flynn isn't afraid to show it in her amazing new book Gone Girl.  Her portrayal of a marriage gone horribly wrong, makes the reader squirm in their collective seats as Flynn shines the light on issues we have but most of us are too afraid to admit.<br /><br />Here's a bit of the plot, but really, it was almost inconsequential for me.  Sure, Flynn writes a tight, suspenseful novel, with enough twists to make you feel like your mind has gone through a pretzel machine, but it's her microscopic view of humanity that hits you over the head with the club of truth that causes you to read far into the night.<br /><br />Nick, the husband, loses his wife on their fifth anniversary.  The house is a mess, and there's a large spot of blood on the kitchen floor that's been cleaned up.  As he watches helplessly, Nick is eventually accused of murdering his beautiful wife.  For a while, I was rooting for Nick, then comes a plot twist and I'm wondering if he really did it.<br /><br />Just as I was waiting for it to wrap up, the second half starts and I'm stunned by the next plot twist.  I can't even imagine how Gillian Flynn came up with this story, and I'm stunned at how much insight she has into the human psyche.  It's like having someone explain quantum physics in a way that you can say you really get it.<br /><br />I've already read Dark Places by Flynn, and now I can't wait to read Sharp Objects.  Flynn has just become one of my favorite new authors.came up with this story, and I'm stunned at how much insight she has into the human psyche.

B0083EM24C|4.0|I always get worried & excited for sophomore albums (not counting the EP). This album is a great follow up and anyone who loved the first album will not be disappointed.
0571273165|4.0|I was very pleased with the condition I received the book in! It was as it was advertised.<br />The book itself, I haven't completed reading, but I'm enjoying every word of it. It's a little confusing to get into at the beginning, as each chapter is like a short story for someone new, but they really take hold and Franco's words magically take you to that place.<br /><br />I definitely recommend giving it a burl!
0896898288|3.0|I have looked through this book, but not sure about it.  It is interesting but I thought it would have cutting instructions based on size of strips to cut, etc.  From what I see, this is all templates, which I have never worked with.  I am a fairly new quilter and this doesn't spell things out like some other books I've seen.  I'm not even sure if you have to use paper or foundation piecing for these blocks....If you are an experienced quilter, I'm sure that would make a difference, but I am totally confused and will need to show the book to friends who know a lot more than I do and ask for assistance.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of puzzle games like this one, but because it was free today I decided to download it and try it out. The puzzles start off very easy so you can learn the game and how to play it, but it gets progressively more difficult.  I was surprised to discover how much I enjoy this game! It works great on the kindle fire - no bugs, force closes, etc. It was thoughtfully made, and when the puzzles get bigger the drag and zoom features are a great tool to have. When I finish this game I will definitely consider buying the first one.  Thanks amazon - every once in awhile your FAotD is a true gem. :)
B008BIN9EW|4.0|This is really a great game. It has intricate gameplay that is simple enough to pick up quickly, but detailed enough to keep you thinking. The strategy involved kept me and my friends talking and scheming and playing constantly. In fact, we eventually had to agree to stop playing because it was taking up too much time.  I love that the classes are similar but distinctly different. Each has their own specialty and a paper/scissors/rock-style organization. They're pretty well balanced (not perfect - I seem to recall humans being a little weak, last I played), so there's a lot of back and forth. And there's just enough randomness to keep it exciting. I only wish updates came a little more often.  It really is the best turn-based strategy game out there, by far. If they ever come out with Uniwar 2, with new races/units/abilities, I'll buy it in a heartbeart.  UPDATE 9/18/2012: Maybe it's just an oversight, but it appears the developers have turned off all compatibility on the amazon store even though this clearly worked in the past. It's unacceptable to pull back compatibility for an app people have already bought. So, until this is fixed, it gets 1 star.  Update 10/21/2012: I've now removed my formerly good review entirely, because I refuse to say anything good about this developer. It's totally absurd the way they treat their sales. Sure, maybe you have regrets about doing the free app a day, but that's YOUR fault; you don't get to just go back on your sales, even if they were free (not to mention the people who actually paid for Uniwar on Amazon and now can't access it... I almost wish I had so I could demand a refund). I got Uniwar on sale on iOS years ago, but I've recently switched to Android, and I probably would have bought it at full price if necessary. But now, not a chance will I ever give any money to this developer.  On a side note, Amazon: You need to make changes to your app sales. I will now never buy any app on Amazon over the alternative market, for fear compatibility may be pulled and I will lose access to my app. Bad policy. Don't allow developers to do this.  Update 7/11/2015: After quite a long period, they seem to have finally sorted this thing out. Still not happy with how it was handled, but I've added back my previous good review. It is a very good game, and they just updated it with some nice new features. Would be 5 stars if it weren't for the above issues.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless, The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown is probably one of the best books I have read in quite some time. It was so good I read it within two days. \\"Fearless takes you deep into SEAL Team SIX, straight to the heart of one of its legendary operators. Its the story of a man of extremes, whose courage and determination was fueled by faith, family and the love of a woman.\\" This is an excellent story of a true American hero and how if you are truly dedicated to achieving something, you can do anything. After high school, Adam Brown fell in with the wrong crowd and his family did what they could to help him. Landing in jail, he finally realized he needed to set a goal and go for it. That goal was to become a Navy SEAL. He achieved that goal and even after losing sight in one eye and the use of his dominant hand through SEAL training or missions, he succeeded. Adam Brown overcame so much and continued to fight both on the battlefield and at home with injuries and setbacks. Reading his story, you really feel like you get to know him and his family. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get to know a true hero and be inspired by what hard work and determination can accomplish. I look forward to reading more of Eric Blehm's work and applaud him for the effort he appears to put into ensuring accurate stories are told of our American heroes.<br /><br />I received this book for free from Blogging for Books/Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for my review.

B008D28HYS|3.0|This is one of the best games on the market. Highly addictive and extremely enjoyable. It is a five star app with one star permissions. Because of that, I've got to average the two together for a there star over all rating. Remove the permissions and you would easily get five stars from me!
B004QK5N5W|1.0|After only a couple uses, the connection to my iPhone started to get looser and looser. It no longer fits properly and now I have to mess with it just to try to get the signal from my phone to transfer to the t.v. I sometimes have to adjust and wiggle the cords for about five minutes until it eventually works. I have no connection problems with this port when I charge my phone, and I've used several different kinds of chargers so I know that the problem is not with my phone. Extremely frustrating for a product that cost over $30. I would most definitely not recommend this particular version of the product. Although, I could have won the luck of the draw and got a faulty product...

HOW STUPID ARE YOU?!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|like it alot but would like a game I don't have to have friends to play. to many games going to that now a days.
B004BEMC6G|3.0|Like binge-eating 10 boxes of your favorite candy, digesting Salt is easy. It's a predictable, chase/thriller of the highest order. Like [[ASIN:B0088TG252 Safe House]], the film features the cliched, CIA-operative-gone-rogue narrative.<br /><br />Who's who? Who can you trust?<br /><br />As someone in the psychology field, the opening scenes, which feature an interview/interrogation, don't come close to realistic portrayals of lie detection. There is neural imaging without any cognitive device attached to the head. There is voice analysis for lie detection, but no measurement of galvanic skin response.<br /><br />When Salt runs, the entire CIA goes after her. She has shown no lethal force and they begin firing at her.<br /><br />Seemingly, every Russian possible infiltrates the US military to make the events unfold occur.<br /><br />It's farfetched - bordering on the insane. But it's also good junkfood if you've got a couple hours to spare.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is a good game that is fun and challenging.  I enjoy it very much and find it very stimulating.  enjoy it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|All you have to do is look at the air dates on the back of the DVD cases to see how Fox royally screwed this show from the outset.  The episode that was meant to be the pilot, to set up the entire series, was not aired until the show was on the air for three months.  Even then it was not aired in its entirety.  Episodes were aired out of order so the story arcs did not flow, and as a result the story did not make as much sense.  All this ensured the series could never gain a foothold.  Anyone with any inkling of Joss Whedon's storytelling style on his other shows knows the way Fox handled this show was the death knell for it.<br /><br />It is sad that these 14 episodes and the movie Serenity are all that will ever be of these characters and the world the writers were trying to create.  It was a unique blend of sci-fi, space exploration, and wild-west shoot outs.  There were many characters all with unique stories that could never been fully explored.  Much like how Buffy started out, the cast was ensemble, with lesser known actors in the lead roles.  Nathan Fillion was probably the most recognizable actor as the series started, but even he was not a mega star.  All that said, because all of the actors were good and the writing was top notch, they pulled it off extremely well.<br /><br />The best way I can describe the show is a mix of Star Trek and Dukes of Hazzard (yet not as cheesy as the Dukes could be).  If you are a fan of Joss Whedon's other shows like Buffy, Angel and Dollhouse, or even watched Firefly when it was on the air but could never really get into it, get the series and see it as it was meant to be seen.  It was a unique show in which the good guys were not totally good, and the bad guys were not all bad.  There are a lot of shades of gray to the characters, and everyone has a sense of being in it for themselves.  If you have seen the movie Serenity and it did not make much sense, this will fill in the gaps and give you the back-story for the movie.Serenity shows where the series would have gone had it been given a chance. Now we can only wonder how they would have gone from point A to point B

0425263908|2.0|I absolutely hate to review books before I have completed them, but in this case I feel it necessary to vent my frustrations. Like many others, after reading 50 Shades of Grey, I was desperately craving something else to read similar to it. I found this book because it kept coming up in searches, so with great apprehension, I purchased it. Probably againt my better judgement, since I did read a couple of reviews first. With that being said, this book is kind of a trainwreck. I went into it with an open mind, trying not to make the comparisons, but the storyline is such a blatant knock off of 50 shades, that it was hard not to constantly compare and contrast while reading.<br /><br />It probably wouldn't have been so bad if it was written better than 50 shades, but the fact of the matter is, it just wasn't. I am beginning chapter 9, and the first 8 chapters were utterly ridiculous. The characters are seriously underdeveloped. I still have new clue how old Eva is, where she went to college, what kind of person she is, etc (maybe I overlooked some things, I dont know). I feel like I know nothing about these 2 people, (Eva and Gideon). Even his initial approach was a sexual harassment lawsuit waiting to happen. Because I don't really know who he is, he just comes off as a psycho, rather than mysterious like Christian Grey, which is what I think Sylvia Day was going for. It feels like she rushed the beginning of the book just to get to the sex scenes, which leaves readers confused and unsympathetic to the characters and their stories.<br /><br />I'm seriously debating on whether I should keep reading to see if it gets better, or just accepting the fact that I'm out $8. If I decide to finish, I will definitely provide an update to this initial review.
0345803493|3.0|This was a little less groan-worthy than the first novel, but not by much. There's a little more insight into the despot that is Christian Grey, but not enough to make his controlling tendencies less creepy. I get that his character is supposed to be loaded and powerful, but it just doesn't seem plausible that he has so many properties, boy toys, and has such power at his age. I mean, buying the company Ana works for just like that? He seems so capricious with his money, which doesn't fit with the control freak thing.<br />Speaking of characters, Ana is just a hot mess in this novel. All she can do is focus on how hot her boyfriend is, bite her lip, say holy s&*$ and f#@&, and obsess over how damaged said hot boyfriend is. Every disagreement/issue leads to sex, which just magically sweeps everything under the rug. I get that this is supposed to be an erotic novel and there's plenty of gratuitous sex, but the scenes are just so repetitive that I actually started skipping over them.<br />I was disappointed by this novel because the plot - these characters loving one another despite their obvious differences, and learning to adjust and grow for the sake of their love - really had potential. Instead, it just played out like a stupid, melodramatic teen romance.
0345803507|3.0|I think James could have very easily stopped at book 2, but book 3 provided a deeper insight into the lives of Christian and Ana. I found the 3rd book to be just okay, simply because the ending was a little too \\"hearts and flowersy\\" for my taste. The book did have a lot of redeeming qualities though. It shows how they both adjusted to married life, even though they still didn't know each other very well. I love the progression of Ana by the third book. Ana went from a sweet, seemingly shy, but bright girl in the first book, to a woman not afraid to speak her mind and even stand up to Christian when he NEEDED it. The intimidation aspect of their relationship was long gone by the third book. She was a lot more sure of herself and was a lot more secure in the relationship throughout book 3.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it does what it needs to do. I like the big number keys and it clears fast. Nice colors  too.
0345803485|5.0|What can I say, I LOVED this book! It was really a great read from start to finish---I could not put it down! I actually read this book in a day! It has been a while since i've had a book to pique my interest the way 50 Shades of Grey did. Based on the reviews, I guess the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy is one of those things where you either love it or hate it. In my honest opinion, I think E. L. James deserves all the hype she is getting right now. She told a great story, I actually like her style of writing, as I find it to be refreshing. All in all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone with even a vague interest in what the hype is about. I think the characters are very well developed by the first 8 chapters of the book. There are a lot of sex scenes, but I didn't mind them in the least. I think they went well with the flow of the book.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|The same stupid actions over and over and over and over and over ...... and UNINSTALLED.  Who has time to do the same thing over and over? Stupid!!
0345803493|5.0|Again, I loved the 2nd part of the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy, which is 50 Shades Darker. By now, we have a better idea of all the characters in the book. We get a better understanding of how they think and function as individuals, so it was really cute to see their relationship unfold in the second series. James did a very good job of throwing dramatic scenes in an otherwise mundane story. The Leila character was interesting as well as how his relationship with Ms. Elena Lincoln played out. I loved how Christian and Ana went out of their way to try something new and I think they were both surprised to learn that they were capable of achieving what they thought was impossible.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Okay, I am not a film buff. I cannot point out glaring errors or find a way to be negative about this nice movie. I did not see the movie in theaters, but I loved it on Blue Ray. I like the story, the visuals, and the acting. I like the heros in this movie, as well as the villans. The lead did a great job of representing a \\"normal young woman\\", not a usual Hollywood starlett with big boobs and no acting ability. Woody did a great job in the movie, playing the part he is best known for...a rogue. This is a great movie for entertainment value and, it made me want to read the books to fill in the details.<br /><br />Review Details<br />Item
B000784WMW|5.0|I've looked for this Eyre, for years and found it.<br />It is worth the search, money and watch.<br />Both the simple beauty of Zelah & the passion of Timothy refresh my heart with a loving smile.
0307474259|5.0|If my title isn't enough of a recommendation for this book, then let me explain.  I was recommended this book by an author friend of mine, who wrote a brilliant book disseminating how to use low cal, low carb, and low fat diets to their maximum possibilities to lose weight, [[ASIN:B008YH9S9U The Three Diets Solution: The Proven Methods For Fast and Sustainable Weight Loss]], I read this book through and through at his behest.  He called it a brilliant work and said it was the simpler of Taubes two and he accredits a lot of his weight loss success to Taubes.  Well, I'm not going to put myself down, but, my understanding it does speak to the simplicity of the book.  I didn't do excellent in biochemistry, but then who did?<br /><br />I need to understand things before I do them, especially when it comes to making changes in my diet.  This book allowed me to try the Low carb eating lifestyle along with my husband, who has type two diabetes.  Well, when I first started, I dropped 11 pounds in 7 days.  Yes, I'm aware that a lot of that was water weight, but, the weight didn't come back, and I've felt great.  My husband has just been told by the doctor that if his blood test come back good next time they're taking him off the medication, also his blood pressure for which he'd been on medication for more than thirty years, has become normal (not enough for the medication to go away, but, still, wow), and his Trygliceryde level once at 370 now down to 120.  He's getting better and better as he keeps going through with the diet.<br /><br />This book is so great, though, I do say, it's not a diet, it's not a plan, it's the science to why it works, and why, when I was recommended this diet, you don't have to worry about the diet killing you.  Low Carb eating plans go against a lot of fundemental teachings, but, I'm living proof they work wonders.<br /><br />Not to mention I have a great amount of energy, and a great amount of jubiliance that at, well, let's just say, my advanced age, is something to celebrate.  I thank Gary Taubes, I thank Clarence Oliver for recommending me, and again, I recommend his book as well, The Three Diets Solution: The Proven Methods To fast and Sustainable Weight Loss.<br /><br />Get them both, you won't regret it.
B003Z4JQGW|5.0|These are the most comfortable and durable sandals I've ever gotten.  I didn't need to get half a size up as some other posters have suggested, but I did have to leave the straps naturally loose so the top wouldn't chafe my toes.  Also, even with the anti-bacterial coating on the sole they will still make my feet stink unless I wash the sandals occasionally.<br /><br />Still, I can't express how much better these are than any of the other sandals I've owned.<br /><br />Well worth the price, especially since I got these at 25% off.
1582701709|3.0|When I saw the documentary when it first came out, I had my entire family watch it, I told friends about it, I gave it out as a gift, I absolutely loved it.  The more I thought about it howeve , the more I realized that the message it was offering wasn't perfect, it didn't meet up to what was in my life, and I accredit Norman Vincent Peale's The Power Of Positive Thinking to my life's success.  An author I know, Clarence Oliver, writer of The Path To Mindful Eating: Overcoming Emotional Eating, is fond of saying that Positive Thinking without Positive action is like a boat on dry land.  I took action and action is what this book is missing.<br /><br />The woman Rhonda Bhyrne's who wrote this book travelled the world, she interviewed people, she worked her perverbial butt off, she took positive action, to tell everyone to think positively.<br /><br />The Secret is the first step.  I don't know anything about the science, so I won't even begin to try and speak on it, I like to think that world can reshape itself, it's part of my faith as a christian as well, but, the science seems a bit difficult to understand, in its simplicity.<br /><br />Look, I loved this movie and I loved the book, and I don't mean to denigrate it, but to give it an honest review that I feel is from the heart.  I believe that if you think positive, truly believe something will come to pass, and you get up and go for it, you'll make it come to pass.  But, if you just sit there and think Beautiful Corvette, no one's coming to your door to give you a Corvette.<br /><br />So, I think I'll leave you with what Clarence Oliver says, Positive Thought Without Positive Action is like a boat on a dry land, getting you nowhere fast.
0062071017|5.0|This rather small book (189 pages) follows the strategy course given at the Harvard's executive Owner/President Management (EOP) program. That fact gets mentioned quite a few times throughout the book. This excessive reminding was not needed as the book is good on its own.<br /><br />Overall the information on strategy covered here is not new (purpose finding, Porter's 5 forces, value creation...) but it does cover mistakes over-confident managers might make when tackling their business strategy. Especially the chapter 'the myth of the super manager' is brilliant in that regard. The book points to some tools and insights that could come in handy (industry effect versus firm effect, profit frontier, strategy wheel, ..) and therefore showing the limitations, challenges or opportunities managers have to deal with in getting their strategy worked out (or revisited).<br /><br />The business cases used are Nasco furniture, Ikea, Gucci, Ink for less, Lance!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Bought this case for my mom's Kindle Fire. It is an awesome case. It is extremely lightweight, yet it is made of high quality plastic that is virtually scratch-proof. It is rubberized on one side for good grip. The stand function works great also, propping up the Kindle Fire for watching videos or just browsing the web. My mom has been using the case for almost a year. She says she's only dropped the Kindle a few times, but says there isn't a scratch on the Fire or the case. She loves it. It is extremely lightweight, adding almost no weight to the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />This is an awesome case to protect your Kindle Fire, while still maintaining ultra portability due to the very lightweight (but strong!) materials used.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|its an easy read, and since i cant stop in the middle of a chapter i read it fairly quickly. but the writhing is mediocre at best, the characters one dimentional, and ok, its sexy, but it realy gets old pretty quick. the ending is so abruptly, it seams like they stopped mid-sentence, or mid-chapter, just so you'll buy the next book. defennetly not a must read.

B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Destroyer was the album that really \\"got me into\\" Kiss and rock and roll. I've owned it in every format imagineable, from 8-track to digital download.  This is an absolute treat for the fan.  I got the cd version because I wanted the booklet.  I was not disappointed! Bob Ezrin's writing was very, very cool.  The never before seen pics were super, and the cd itself looks awesome.  I imported it using apple's lossless setting for maximum punch.  I could drone on about each and every track, but if you know the album, you know the deal.  There are a few differences from the original....you'll know when you hear them.  For me the stand out is \\"Sweet Pain\\" with the alternate guitar parts.  I think I'm more excited about this than I am about the upcoming album \\"Monster\\" ....but hey, I will buy that to give it a shot.  For me though, always...Kiss is: Peter, Ace, Gene, and Paul.
0425263908|5.0|I read the 50 shades trilogy and enjoyed the characters and the love story but felt the writing, especially the x rated scenes, was immature.  After 50 shades I moved on to Bared to Me and loved the book.  I could not put the book down. I read it in one night. I can't wait for October to find out what haunts Gideon.

B0089LT8Y6|3.0|I wouldn't call it a classic but its a solid effort. Off the back the cover art is just stunning! It's one of the things that separates metal from any other type of music; a crazy, epic, and detailed cover! Chuck Billy's voice is fierce as always. The guitar playing is very strong, especially on solo sections, and drumming is good, but was expecting more from Gene Holgan.<br /><br />1) Rise Up - 9/10 Intensity right off the back! RISE UP! WAR! Can't get any better than this.<br />2) Native Blood - 10/10 Great lyrics, Heavy, thrashy, with an amazing video.<br />3) Dark Roots of The Earth - 9/10 Powerful song with a lot of muscle, and a great chorus.<br />4) True American Hate - 8.5/10 Solid Song.<br />5) A Day in The Death - 6/10 This is when album starts to loose steam, but not such a bad track.<br />6) Cold Embrace - 2/10 Failed attempt at a &#34;Fade to Black&#34; type song.<br />7) Man Kills Mankind - 5/10 Good filler song, nothing special.<br />8) Throne of Thorns - 8/10 The epic of the album.<br />9) Last Stand for Independence - 9/10 Great opening riff, and perfect finishing song.

B006LSZECO|5.0|It was amazing how the main characters in Gone Girl pulled me right into their heads. It was hard at times to figure out who was sane and what direction the story was going. The murderer mystery I expected was turned on its head. Very engrossing. I plan to look for other highly rated books by this author.
B001CZJKS0|2.0|This is not at all what we thought it was. The first three movies are same. 1 is a Blue-Ray. 2 is a DVD version of the original film. 3 is an Extended Version.  4 is a documentry Disc. 5 is Holloween 4 and disc 5 is Holloween 5.  So we are missing movies 2 and 3.  We thought we were getting the first six films.  MY BAD....  Don't waste your money if you think your getting the first six  films !!!

B004I2K4DY|3.0|I suppose I consider myself a superfan of the show, and have seen it the most of any musical out there.<br />That being said, I can't really pick a favorite over-all show, since the performances are so different. I will say that the 25th version has WAY more musical numbers than the 10th and makes more sense of some storylines than before. My argument for the 25th would be to fill in the missing blanks...and I love a good Thernardier couple either way. Props for casting the same lady as Madam Thernardier both times, made that an easy decision for me!<br /><br />But, with the exception of Lea Salonga as Fantine in the 25th, the 10th just feels more...real to me.<br />I guess I am partial to the 10th, mostly because of the performers involved. Jean Valjean is a somewhat flexible character vocally...but I love Colm's delivery in some areas better. Who Am I, Bring Him Home, etc. Also a toss-up for Javert (except for his death...Philip Quast gave me the shivers on his last note), Eponine, Cossette, and others. But for me, Michael Ball will forever and always be the voice of Marius, and Nick Jonas just doesn't bring the depth to it. Empty Chairs at Empty Tables doesn't have that raw, suffering emotion to it that Michael Ball gave it in the 10th. He really made you believe he was the only survivor. Nick brings the pop star to the table, and I feel the casting was more for looks than for voice. He can sing the part...just not as dynamically as Michael did.<br />I am a musician, so naturally I notice music changes as well. I find that the 10th had more dynamic and powerful music, especially during the musical 'call-back' to Bring Him Home, after the battle sequence. For some reason, it just feels more somber and sad. Also I find that One Day More is somehow more electrically charged in the 10th.<br /><br />Take a risk, get them both and decide for yourself. Now if only there were some way to mash together my favorite numbers from each show...hmm...
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|This play was meant for Redford and Farrow.  Check out the price of gas, and notice Sam Waterson (from Law & Order).  Excellent acting, costumes, settings.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|The main purpose for this device for me is to amplify the signal from my PC speakers to my headphones. For whatever reason, my speakers' (Creative Labs GigaWorks T40s) headphone jack doesn't pass the EQ through to the headphones so I have to crank the speaker volume way up to get a good signal through.<br /><br />This device delivers exactly what I need: A nice, clean signal with enough options for what I need. The sound output to my various Sennheiser cans is perfect, they all sound like a brand new experience.<br /><br />The PX100-IIs have a beautifully clear sound on the \\"blue\\" EQ setting of the Fiio. Not too bass heavy, wonderful clear mids and highs. This is a great $75 (total) setup for somebody looking for portability and great sound.<br /><br />My HD-280 Silvers sounded best on the \\"red\\" setting which boosted the bass a bit. These are nice cans for $100 or so and with the amp they really shine. Honestly, I think I like the PX100-IIs better, but I need to mess with them both a bit more.<br /><br />My lowest end Sennheisers are the HD-202s and even they sounded like a totally different set of cans, for a ~$20 set it's dang impressive.<br /><br />The Fiio E6 is easily the best $30 I have spent on tech recently. I don't think you can go wrong... this thing is tiny, powerful and will improve your listening experience no matter what you're listening too or through.<br /><br />My recommendation: Find a good set of cans (spend what you're comfortable with) and grab a Fiio E6, it will improve whatever you choose immensely
B0090EIILU|1.0|This film was dreadful and a bore.  The jokes were tired and I can't even recall laughing once.  I expected much more from Cohen.  I think he should stick to other people's projects.
0393064476|2.0|I have no idea how this book won the National Book Award. OK, it is well written, but there isn't much to it.  As other reviewers have noted, the book is not remotely about Lucretius or Epicurus -- what is the difference between their world view and the Stoics? Basic information like this is missing.  it is all about Poggio Bracciolini and the hunt for ancient books, but it doesn't even do a very good job of that.  Where is the rest of the amazing history of the earlier finds,  more than a few sentences about the tortured history of what made it through the sieve of those 6 hundred years -- why do we have Aristotle, why these plays of Euripedes, etc?  All we get is the Alexandria library and Petrarch's obsession (always good tales, but that isn't all the story).  There is the amazing story of Oxyrinchus and the carbonized findings (yes, these do get mentioned, barely), to mention only one fascinating line of archeological research tossed off in a few sentences.  What of the Arab translations and transmissions?<br /><br />We get almost nothing on the history of Florence in the late 14th century (Hans Baron might never have lived), maybe the most important moment in the rise of republican thought, and the critical importance of rhetoric for politics.  And then we head into the 17th century, and atomism (supposedly the big deal idea of the book) -- but where are Gassendi and Descartes and the struggle to come to terms with atomism, e.g. vortices, etc.?<br /><br />I'm afraid they gave this book the award because the whole era and the idea of the search for manuscripts are so intrinsically interesting. Not this book.
B008JAG9BW|2.0|It has been a month and I don't remember one thing about this film outside of the fact that it failed in every aspect where AP and AP 2 succeeded.  It was nice to see that many of the actors have not honed their acting skills over the years.  And, Stiffler and Jim's Dad simply can't carry these films.  I'd pass on this class reunion.

B008M34INW|4.0|This was the film I was waiting for from Gibson.  He had made a couple of interesting turns, but this movie was pure fun.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this little Mexican romp.  It was an interesting story and had plenty of humor and action.  The opening sequence really sets the tone.  I'm not sure why this didn't not get a national release, because it was one of the better films I saw this summer.
B008OM0M4U|5.0|Store is failing, has jew take over counting the cash and money starts to flow in.  So unPC. 100 times funnier than Chaplin's Dicator. Sacha Baron Cohen is the funniest man alive.

B001OGWY1W|5.0|I have seen this film before, but my dad had not, so when I couldn't find the film at the video store I decided to rent it on Amazon Instant Video. This is the second movie that I have rented from Amazon, but it will not be the last. Amazon has done an amazing job of competing with Netflix and other video sharing bodies because they offer top-notch quality (as long as you have a good internet connection) and excellent rental agreements. I will definitely be going to Amazon in the future to rent my movies!
B0064W65SO|3.0|I havent finished reading it yet.<br />but the main problem I see is that the format of the comic book for the kindle fire is not the best.<br />it would be easier if one could just zoom in the page and slide it around instead of tapping at specific areas to read the text.<br />both reading and enjoying the art cannot be done at the same time. and So I might consider buying the printed copy instead.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" begins on the right note:<br /><br />An inert body floats on the surface of a body of water, seen from underneath--much as Matt Damon did in the opening scene of \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" which began the previous trilogy.<br /><br />But, as he abruptly dives down into arctic waters to fetch an important submerged packet we quickly see that this movie is going to be different from that one, though not overly so.  In the end, the opening scene will have let us in on that, too: we're different, but we're similar, too.<br /><br />First of all, this is a more than enjoyable film that is capably handled and well directed.  I did have some caveats, but you can rest assured your money will be well spent.<br /><br />This time around, Jeremy Renner is our \\"Bourne,\\" though in the name of Aaron Cross (or sometimes Number Five).  What's interesting is that this movie takes place in approximately the same time-frame of \\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" the final member of the trilogy, which ended with Bourne and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, as a high up muckity muck who has been investigating CIA shenanigans) outwitting the creators of a secret corps of high dollar super soldiers tasked with black ops missions like assassinating foreign bigwigs unfavorable to the U.S., etc.  Cross is a member of Outcome, a fittingly named project in which its agents have been systematically \\"enhanced\\" genetically, giving them higher mental and physical performance than any previous agents have ever achieved.<br /><br />Including Bourne, I guess.<br /><br />Like the previous trilogy, the government officials in charge of these clandestine activities have grown frightened of exposure, and the movie details the officials' cold, calculated murders of Outcome operatives rather than risk their identification.  As one might guess, they let one get away, and for that they will pay dearly.<br /><br />I suppose, that is...as the movie doesn't show that.  In fact, while Ed Norton is, as always, terrific in the role of one of the bureau chiefs, the old cast of the \\"Bourne\\" trilogy simply hit their marks one by one and are dismissed, their parts probably taking up a collective minute or two of screen time.  Bourne himself (Matt Damon) was shown only in still shots--I wonder what he got paid for that?  Landy and these others (played by Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Stacey Keech, and David Strathairn) are merely the window dressing meant to show us the tie-in is all part of the same kind of shadow government we all fear are running things anyway.<br /><br />As to agent Cross, Jeremy Renner looks the part and does a nice job capturing the essence of a trained killer who is as lethal with a gun as he is with a pen, a nail, or whatever else he can get his hands on.  I was a little disappointed that this movie never really tested Renner other than some very clever parkour scenes across the rooftops of Manila to rescue the female scientist who is helping him (Rachel Weisz).<br /><br />Toward the end of the movie, as our bureau chiefs get really nervous and demand results, they dig up an operative from a NEW government program called Larx (his number is Larx-03), and his use even draws gasps from his handlers, as we find that the Larx(ians?) are bred to be even MORE highly developed physically and have been programmed not to feel pain OR remorse.  This seems a sure setup for a great battle that will let  us check out just how good our Mr. Cross is.  Yet--and I'm not going to tell you how it ends--I was disappointed there too.<br /><br />All in all I felt \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" was a worthy spin-off, yet I don't think it really hit its stride.  It took a little too much time setting itself up, held very few real surprises, and didn't have that same improvisational cleverness that Damon's character always seemed to possess--the buffer \\"MacGyver,\\" if you will.<br /><br />But Renner looks the right man for the part.  He's got a sweet yet well-traveled face, he certainly seems to be physically capable, and he seems to have the smarts for handling a complex role--if you have any doubts, see him in \\"The Hurt Locker.\\"  And Rachel Weisz is a fine actress, possessing the skills to be both vulnerable and competent at the same time.<br /><br />But the one I'm looking forward to seeing is any remnant of the Larx  program (gasp!) as his nemesis.  Maybe Larx-04 will test his mettle.<br /><br />Of course, we could maybe sometime see one of these Gazillion Dollar Soldiers just carry out an actual mission.  I know I'm asking a lot, but in these Recessionary times it would be nice if our Gazillion Dollar Soldiers actually stopped killing each other and actually tackled some enemy bad guys.<br /><br />\\"Bourne, Re-Born\\"?  Any takers?-traveled face, he certainly seems to be physically capable, and he seems to have the smarts for handling a complex role--if you have any doubts, see him in \\"The Hurt Locker.\\"  And Rachel Weisz is a fine actress, possessing the skills to be both vulnerable and competent at the same time.<br /><br />But the one I'm looking forward to seeing is any remnant of the Larx  program (gasp!) as his nemesis.

B008D28HYS|5.0|if you liked the regular cross me then you are sure to like this one. I like the the addition of colors in this edition because it can make it a bit easier to figure out. Overall a very good app for kindle fire.
030758836X|5.0|THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!<br /><br />Why are you reading this?<br /><br />If you had any sense, you'd be running to the store to buy this book...or better yet, just click your mouse a couple of times and have it whisked to you via Amazon.  Whatever gets it to you the quickest.<br /><br />Because you should absolutely be reading this book right now.  I used to think Ruth Rendell was the craziest murder thriller writer out there...the one who didn't just follow the footprints of the killer and put you in the room with him, but got you right inside his (or her) mind.<br /><br />And now I must add Gillian Flynn.<br /><br />This is more than just a terrific read, it's an absolute thrill ride; told from the point of view of both Nick and Amy, husband and wife, this is the story of a marriage gone foul.  Horrendously foul.<br /><br />It all begins when Amy goes missing, suddenly, a couple of hours after making breakfast for her husband on the morning of their fifth anniversary.  He gets the call at the bar he and his twin sister co-own, and when he returns home he finds his once comfortable house is now a crime scene awash with blood and overturned furniture.  And when the police get involved, the case of a missing wife turns extremely ugly.<br /><br />Because if Nick's innocent, why does every piece of evidence point to him? And WHY is he saying and doing such ridiculously incriminating things?<br /><br />There is scarcely any down time in this novel: Nick gets a call that the door to his house is wide open on page 22, and from that moment on he is spiraling down a greased chute of suspicion, guilt, and recrimination.  Since Nick's and Amy's sides of the tale are told in alternating chapters, you might wonder how the reader is kept in suspense, but Amy's side of the story is told from the point of view of her diary, and it is particularly through her entries that we get to discover a side of Nick that doesn't look good at all.<br /><br />And there's more, so much more: as the police get involved and the evidence at the house points to a staged fight, as one might guess all signs point to Nick.  But as Nick tells his side of the story and we begin to learn more about him, he and the case of his missing wife begin to peel away like metaphorical layers of an onion, and what we discover about their marriage, and about them, grows increasingly dark (more about this dark side later).<br /><br />Because Nick is under pressure now: under the white-hot glare of not only the police investigation, but also the public outcry led by a vengeful celebrity talk-show host, Nick's foundations are rooted out and torn from him.  Even his twin sister---the person closest to him his whole life--begins to see him as a foreigner, alien to her.  It is all Nick can do to even exist.<br /><br />And that's when things start turning seriously sinister.<br /><br />Let me tell you this: I'm a clever guy, and I'm always trying to think ahead of the story I'm reading, but there are surprises in this story that rocked me.  I mean, there are places in this novel where no force of nature or man could have torn me away from my reading...I'm not kidding.  It's that compulsive a tale.  My biggest problem lay in not being able to tell someone what I was reading--I just had to talk about this story.<br /><br />So, without telling you a thing about the plot other than what you'd read on the book flap--I sit here in my den, typing on my processor, imploring you to read this tale.  EVEN WHEN IT PLAYS ITS HAND, even when it lays its cards in front of you and shows you how it has played you, this novel still has surprises in store.<br /><br />For that's really where the true secret of \\"Gone Girl\\" lies: not in the footsteps we follow to find out what happened, but in the mind of its perpetrator.  It's a tale that thrills in the fraying of nerves as it takes its twists and turns--especially when you find out it's been playing with your mind all along.<br /><br />In regards tothose reviews of one- and two-stars, I will add one piece of advice: yes, the ending IS dark.  This mystery is not going to wrap up everything in one happy little ball--understand that.  But really, I would have been disappointed if it had.<br /><br />I loved \\"Gone Girl,\\" and I'm on my way to get \\"Sharp Objects\\" and \\"Dark Places,\\" her two previous works.  Flynn has decidedly earned my respect.<br /><br />Now--stop reading and BUY IT!!those reviews of one- and two-stars, I will add one piece of advice: yes, the ending IS dark.

B008602KQI|5.0|At any other time in history, this movie/book would have been a moderately good science fiction adventure story.  But given the times that we live in RIGHT NOW- where \\"Reality t.v.\\" has taken root in pop culture, where shows like \\"Survivor\\" reward people for exhibiting the worst in human behavior (e.g. duplicity, treachery, backstabbing, 'us against them' mentality, etc.) for the sake of higher ratings & corporate advertising/interests, where the common people are manipulated and exploited by crooked 'charitable' institutions, swindlers like Bernie Madoff, Wall Street, the Tea Party, The Left, The Right, Academicians, the housing industry & the derivatives scam, etc. -- there are so many people who understand the sentiment expressed by one of the main characters when he says that his only wish is to take a stand to show the powers that be that \\"they can't change me and they don't own me.\\"  I believe some people were disappointed by the screen adaptation b/c the movie makers only hinted at the underlying not-so-subversive protest over the perverse nature of the dehumanizing institution that results when the entertainment industry melds with the big money of corporations, the loss of privacy via greater surveillance technology, the use of \\"patriotism\\" as a means of fanning resentments and the struggle for control over the government apparatus.  I seriously doubt that future movie critics will be able to fully grasp why this had the impact that it did.

B008QWQ0FI|4.0|It must be hard for an act that's been around as long as PSB to come to grips with the mp3 generation.  It's nice to see them keeping with singles<br />releases with proper b-sides and remixes.  This first of a two-part set (the second contains a cache of remixes of the title track) has the traditional 7\\" version of Winner, a fun but decidedly middle-of-the-road single written with the London Olympics in mind.  It's an inspiring little song about achievement and work ethic and self motivation but kind of forgettable when compared with the b-sides here.<br /><br />As J. McKracken wrote here before me, the b-sides are the true gems in this release.  \\"A Certain 'Je ne sais quoi'\\" could, in my opinion, be released as a single on its own.  Catchy hooks, driving beat, it's synth-pop the way PSB do best.  'I started a joke' is lovely and poignant and 'The Way Through The Woods' is pure experimental b-side stuff that shows just how versatile Neil and Chris continue to be regarding their choice of source material and methods of exposition.  A quarter century on and these two are still in top form. I'm anxiously awaiting Elysium and will, like all their other albums, buy the extended edition, this time with instrumental versions of the album tracks as the bonus material.<br /><br />As for the other reviewer here who complains of these sounding of 'demo quality' I couldn't disagree more.  The production here is, like every PSB production since the dawn of time, crystalline, well-balanced, and richly mastered.  Listen in a good pair of headphones or stereo speakers to appreciate what I'm talking about for yourself.
0143119680|1.0|I must say that I was incredibly disappointed with this book, especially since at first it seemed so promising. The writing is a slightly more intelligent version of Stephenie Meyer's; it is written in purple prose (prose that is fluffed up) so that it can seem more intelligent. The heroine is so idiotic that she chooses to put herself in the protection of a vampire, and listens to his every whim. The only time she doesn't follow his orders is when it would actually be a pretty good idea to. The characters are Mary Sues and one-dimentional. Our heroine is clumsy, endearing, softly pretty, completely irresistible to hot vampires, etc. She might as well just be known as the witch version of Bella Swan. As for the vampire (Matthew/Edward) he's protective, overbearing, good-looking. Thank goodness he doesn't sparkle!<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me in the book was the fact that the protagonist was way too powerful. She doesn't really have to struggle to learn her magic either, it just all comes out sort of at once. Because of her power there's really no need for further books, because she could easily vanquish opponents effortlessly.<br /><br />In other words, I truly think Ms. Harkness should stick to writing about wine......

B00124PXW8|5.0|I watched this movie on TV just recently after seeing the original release 39 years ago, and it's still a helluva scary movie, and for sheer fright factor possibly the scariest movie ever made, even if you're not religious. The images of Regan being consumed by the demon are unforgettable and still vivid in my mind after almost 40 years.<br /><br />As the story is so well known I won't reprise it here, and just want to make a few miscellaneous comments that perhaps someone will find useful.<br /><br />After seeing the movie I read the book by William Peter Blatty, and was pleased to see that the movie followed the book fairly well. In fact, because of the amazing visuals, the movie was actually scarier than the book in many ways.<br /><br />Almost every scene in the movie attempts to ratchet up the fear factor or is in some way tense or just vaguely unpleasant. There's just no let up in the movie until the final climactic scene. Even things that aren't really explained very well just add to the tension.<br /><br />For example, the hatred of the Burke Dennings character (who plays the movie director) for Ellen Burstyn's old butler, Karl, who he accuses of being a Nazi, just isn't explained at all in the movie but it does add to the overall sinister ambience of the whole movie. The only connection is Karl has a Germanic accent, but he claims to be Swiss. Dennings is the first person killed off by the demon but we know he's a bad guy because at the dinner party he gets drunk and acts boorishly, continually taunts Karl while he is trying to serve the guests, and at one point says he just found a public hair in his soup. Obviously, the demon has to kill this guy first. :-)<br /><br />In fact, almost no one in the film is having a very happy life. The film within a film takes place against the tense backdrop of the Vietnam War protests on the Georgetown University campus. Father Damien is having a crisis of faith, and is also worried about his aged mother who insists on living in her old house despite the dilapidated neighborhood now being unsafe. Once the demonic possession starts, it's a total descent into fear and hysteria for the whole Burstyn household. Even the psychiatrists and medical doctors aren't doing too well as a desperate Burstyn chastises them for not being able to diagnose her daughter's condition adequately or come up with a good idea for treatment. When in desperation Burstyn takes her daughter to a psychiatrist, the hapless shrink makes the mistake of commanding the demon to show himself while Regan is hypnotized. Unfortunately for the psychiatrist the demon is only too happy to oblige and at that point Regan grabs the guy's you know what in a death grip. Ouch!!!<br /><br />About the only character who seems to be having a good time is Detective Kinderman, played by Lee. J. Cobb, who is intrigued by the murder mystery of the dead director and is delighted to be able to get Burstyn's (who plays a famous actress) autograph.<br /><br />Then there's the use of almost subliminal frames in the movie in the scene where father Damien is dreaming of his recently deceased mother. Just for a split second a cadaverous face appears on the screen which I presumed to be the dead mother but in researching this further (in the Wikipedia article on the movie) it is actually supposed to be an image of the Assyrian demon Pazuzu who father Merrin has battled before.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole audience shrieked at that point in the theater I was in, and at other scary moments such as Regan turning her head all the way around, rising off the bed, etc., the young woman seated in back of me was so terrified that she grabbed me from behind and held on to me. I never did turn around to see who it was, but maybe she came with a girlfriend instead of her boyfriend, but anyway, the whole movie theater was screaming in fear at the scariest moments so it was quite an experience. This was the movie's first week and I suppose the word hadn't gotten out yet about how disturbing it actually was. I went to it because a friend of mine said, oh, it's about a priest and it has to do with religion and it's supposed to be scary. Nothing else. Yeah right. So off we went. Needless to say, we were totally unprepared for what we saw. My friend was so freaked out he refused to go home that night and spent the next three days sleeping on my couch.<br /><br />The dramatic build up to the final climactic scenes are so well known I won't reprise them here, but it goes to show you that just when you thought the movie couldn't get any scarier the movie hits you over the head with another shocker of a scene. It was just unrelenting. Overall, a great horror/suspense classic that has probably never been surpassed before or since.tten out yet about how disturbing it actually was.

1400069289|1.0|The topic is definitely interesting and the book starts off with all the good questions about habits of people who have managed to change their lives, (this was the main reason for me to buy the book looking at the amazon reviews) the first few chapters about human habits and recent scientific studies on how the brain function is of some interest.<br />The majority of the book is full of chatter specially the topics around organizational habits, habits of societies etc, the author tries very hard to connect everything to some form of habit reasoning .. most of the examples and stories and the habit connections are just silly ..<br />After the first 30 mins of reading the rest of the book is a complete letdown.
B008RTE09S|5.0|I immediately pre-ordered the Blu-ray of Magical Mystery Tour - confident that the Capitol label and McCartney's personal involvement would guarantee this to be a genuinely fine high definition experience. 16mm film is capable of looking very impressive on Blu-ray (a prime example is \\"Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live\\"). The quality of the restoration for this first official MMT release is truly astonishing - and that's in regard to both the video and audio. The main soundtrack is in either genuine stereo (i.e. not simulated) or a skillfully mixed and very impressive 5.1 surround.<br /><br />Paul McCartney's commentary track is well worthwhile - he shares some interesting first hand knowledge in a very laid back manner. Ringo adds his comments to camera in the \\"Making Of\\" special feature, and there are archival comments by John and George.<br /><br />I love this film not just because of the Beatles music, but also because it features my favourite Scottish artist, Ivor Cutler (as main character \\"Buster Bloodvessel\\") - I'm very happy to see that he performs in one of the bonus features. MMT also includes my clear favourite comedy music group, The Bonzo Dog Band singing \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\".<br /><br />For any fan of Ivor Cutler, The Beatles and/or the Bonzo Dog Band, this official Blu-ray or DVD will be a invaluable addition to their collection.<br /><br />Prior to this October 2012 release the only 2 DVD versions that had been available were transfers from very noisy film (with the out of print \\"MPI\\" release being vastly superior to the \\"Avenue One\\" atrocity).<br /><br />MMT is a wonderful diversion - an eccentric delight which I've enjoyed 100 or more times over the years - and which I will enjoy even more in years to come.

B0089BSLUS|5.0|The cover for this is a superb quality gatefold mini-LP sleeve, as good as the best Japanese packaging.<br /><br />The music, of course is excellent. Live vocal performances.
B005LAIHHC|1.0|I generally thought I liked SBC's brand of humor -with the exception of ALI G or whatever that waste of film was called- which is more how I would compare this film to rather than Bruno or Borat which were funnier because they had the illusion of being spontaneous and prankish. I waited for this film to be released, and had high hopes but this was a disappointment. The punch lines get old and overused and this film is mostly boring and predictable in a adolescent and moronic way. There were a couple funny scenes but in general it had good potential and was a flop.<br />Just look somewhere else for entertainment cause this is not that funny.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is one of the best alarm clocks I've ever used. Since it's on my Kindle, I'm not willing to throw it across the room like I would a cheap $10 alarm clock. It's also not small enough to fall under the bed, like my cellphone would. The alarm noises are customizeable with different tones or my own music. I LOVE the math questions for allowing snooze. There's nothing worse than having to figure out math problems just to go back to sleep. I set it to snooze for 5 problems, but completely shut off after 2. Might as well get up after 2 math problems. Not worth it for me to try 5. I also like being able to set multiple alarms at different times, on different days, with different tones. The alarm won't work if the device is shut off. Maybe the full version does, but I only have the free one.<br />I've seen some reviewers that complained that the alarm drained their battery. I've not noticed that on mine, and I always have it running in the background.
B007SGM084|2.0|I read all three and started asking what all the hype was about this is Teeny Bopper romance, Every turn of the page was mostly have a jolly good Rodgering or some other same old scene ir did have a story of save the new love of his life from certian death but to be honest if you want to know about BDSM/Domestic Discipline Try reading \\"Its suppost to hurt\\" Coming out on Top and We need to have a little talk! They talk about and share what its like and being on both sides of the Knee bye a very interesting Lady Cassandra Park, she share stories from friends and her life as a Switch and different Spanking events accross the US so it you really want to read what its all about check out these two books they are great

I have knocked it against walls, doors, cars, and rocks- each time i look down expecting to see a scratch or blemish- and nothing- it still looks as good as the day i bought it- the glass and bezel both seem to be very scratch resistant<br />2. waterproofness- i had some concerns as it was only rated to 50 m, but i have worn it swimming, in the shower, riding my motorcycle in the rain, etc. and have had no problems with leaking<br />3. Timekeeping- plenty accurate for my use- after 1 month i checked it against the atomic clock and it had gained 15 or 20 sec.<br />4. comfort- strap is great-ive worn it 24-7 for the month and it is softening up nicely, but does not look worn or ratty.<br /><br />All in all- very impressed.
030758836X|2.0|I've been looking forward to Flynn's new book Gone Girl, and Tana French's Broken Harbor for over a year. I was really disappointed with Gone Girl. It took me some time to get into the characters (she switches points of view throughout), especially the female character. Can't remember her name a week after I put the book down. It got slightly better when a twist (not a great one) finally arrived. If you want to give this author a try, definitely read one of her first two.<br />I have not finished Broken Harbor yet but the quality of the writing is so stark in contrast to Gone Girl. Tana French creates her mysteries with a combination of fine literature and compelling light reading. She's the best.
B005LAIGQ4|1.0|The one thing I took away from this movie is that when you market a movie for children there is no need to ramble off a list of big stars that appear in the movie because kids don't care and families will flock to your movie regardless.  I mean, had this been a film for adults you can rest assured that every TV spot would have lambasted the screen with the names Ted Danson, Kristen Bell, John Michael Higgins, Dermot Mulroney and Kathy Baker, not to mention possibly Vinessa Shaw.  Instead, we knew Drew Barrymore was frumping it up here and John Krasinski was headlining this whale extravaganza and that was it.  I know this isn't like big news or anything, but it was the only thing I took away from this blandly crafted family film that will bore your family and inspire you to do absolutely nothing.  Maybe I'm jaded since I think John Krasinski is a terrible actor who thinks he is funny and it annoys me to no end, but overall this was such a dry and clunky film that lived in clich&eacute;s, misrepresented facts (and nonsensically) and produced nothing of real merit.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Unless you're shopping for the deluxe edition of the film, you can purchase it from Amazon UK for under $20 (region free blu ray). The book and extras are nice, but I just care about the film.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Walking into `The Lincoln Lawyer', I was well aware that the film itself would have to work extra hard to earn my respect.  I don't really care much for courtroom dramas, and I find Matthew McConaughey to be a really dull presence on screen.  I know that everyone swoons over him and talks about his `Southern Charm', but I just don't buy it.  On top of that, I just don't find him to be a convincing actor.  I don't see layers in his work; I merely see a lazy approach to telling the same character over and over.  There has been a lot of talk of the sudden upswing in his career, starting with this particular film and moving right on into his string of successful turns this year.  Much has been made of his Oscar chances for `Magic Mike' and he's getting career best notices for the savage drama `Killer Joe'.  Needless to say, I didn't care much.  I have yet to see any of his films from this year and I wasn't really anticipating them much to tell you the truth.  When I hear the name Matthew McConaughey I don't expect much.<br /><br />So, last night I settled in to catch up on my DVR recordings and I noticed that I had `The Lincoln Lawyer' on my DVR.  I didn't record it, must have been the wife, but I wasn't really in the mood to think and so I decided to give it a whirl, since I expected it to be `good' at best and hardly something I'd feel compelled to dissect.<br /><br />I have to learn to stop judging every book by its cover.<br /><br />As a film, `The Lincoln Lawyer' is riveting and kept me glued throughout.  I was stunned.  The plot twists are engaging, and while the obviousness of the `villain' is a little too on the nose from the start, it becomes an easily forgivable offence since they aren't really interested in keeping his innocence ambiguous for very long.  The progression of the plot is well done and expertly paced by director Brad Furman, who holds onto the tension efficiently.  The final courtroom scene is pulse-racing for sure, and basically exemplifies everything that a courtroom drama should be.  In fact, I loved the fact that I never knew what Mick's next move would be and why he was making it, but when it all fell into place it made perfect sense.<br /><br />And that brings me to Mick, or should I say, Matthew McConaughey.  Why do I call this a case of Oscar snubbery?  I don't know if I'd personally nominate him, considering that last year was ridiculously strong, but a very solid case can be made for McConaughey being a snub because this role is every bit a perfect one to garner a star their first Oscar nomination.  What McConaughey does here is actually quite remarkable, and I don't say there merely because he took me by surprise or because I expected him to fail.  Any other actor in the role doing what he does would have garnered the same response from me.  I am not one to shy away from eating crow, and that is what I must do here.<br /><br />Something that I have always accused Matthew of doing is giving us a surface performance, with no actual depth.  I understand that in the beginning of his career he tried the whole `soul searching drama' stuff, and he did do `A Time to Kill' and yet I didn't care much for what he did in that film and so it doesn't count for me.  I've never felt that he has ever gotten under the skin of the character much at all; until now.  As Mick Haller, McConaughey layers so much on this man it's ridiculous.  In fact, the more I think about it the more stunned I am by the scope of his performance.  Mick is suave and under control and possesses that `Southern Charm' and sheer confidence that makes him a firm presence in any room.  That is something that McConaughey should be able to handle in his sleep.  But it is the tiny layers of panic that ride through his face when no one is looking that took me by surprise.  Mick wasn't just a stone, and as this `case' took over his personal life and threatened him in the severest of ways, you saw those cracks.  McConaughey let us in to see the inner turmoil, but then batted an eyelash and firmed up his stance and delivered a `performance' for the rest of the room that read otherwise.  Mick is a showman, and McConaughey mastered that aspect of his persona with ease.  The way he plays his part in the courtroom or the way he betrays his own panic by laying a threat of confidence out on his `client' is compelling and 100% believable.  The anger that floods his motives is also stirring and he sells his biggest moments with such authenticity.  I appreciated that he never overacted here, and there was place for it.  Instead, he displayed an honest depiction of emotional outbursts that stayed true to the man he was portraying.<br /><br />When all is said and done, Mick Haller may be human, but he is one cool cat.<br /><br />So, I give this very high marks.  The film is intriguing and engrossing from start to finish.  It has the ability to veer into `television courtroom drama' territory, as do a lot of films in this genre, and yet it pulls back with a glossy treatment and a plot that thickens rather well.  It's more `CSI: Miami' than `Law & Order', but Matthew McConaughey delivers a star performance that puts David Caruso to shame.r turmoil, but then batted an eyelash and firmed up his stance and delivered a `performance' for the rest of the room that read otherwise.

B008D28HYS|5.0|I like the Picross game a lot (though that may just be a name the Nintendo vendor uses?). This is even better as other are colors instead of just empty spaces.  Though I suppose all the 1 star reviews for permission issues are legitimate, I feel that I must counteract by actually reviewing the game.  Since I have a tablet, few of the permission requirements affect me.  If you are the same, this is a very fun game.  It will provide a lot of entertainment!

Now that I'm paying attention I have manifested the transition into a career that is completely aligned to my divine purpose. This deck has also allowed me to help others get answers!Amazing
B008GOAFBQ|2.0|First let me state that I have been a KISS fan since 1976 and I have stuck up for them through albums like Unmasked and The Elder (which I actually like) but, me being a fan for so many years did not prepare me for the $9 I spent on this CD. What a let down.<br /><br />Sonically, it fatigued my ears. The re-worked vocals and brightened guitar parts were barely noticeable at first but, by the time God of Thunder started, my ears hurt...I found myself turning the volume down repeatedly through out the whole disc.<br /><br />The re-worked bass and the tightening of the drums was decent but, in my opinion, the first press CD or the 1997 re-master would be a much better choice.<br /><br />I thought the Ozzy remaster of Blizzard of Oz was bad but, this beats it by miles. I laughed at the part in Bob Ezrin's linear notes that stated he fixed a problem that was vexing him from the original recording session - then challenges us to find it. Really? Just listen to the first few measures of \\"Flaming Youth\\"...<br /><br />Perhaps it was how it was originally recorded that limited them to what they could do. Bob Ezrin went into great detail in the linear notes explaining how he only had a 16-track recorder back then and that the guitars were paired up in stereo as were the drums, thus limiting what he could do. Notice I said what Bob could do - not KISS.<br /><br />KISS should have put they're cash heavy, lazy butts back in the studio and reworked some of these parts - that would have made this CD a real treasure.

The writing style sounds like a teenage voice which is not consistant with who she says the character is in the book.  If I see her write about an inner goddess again I may just scream!!!

Overall the book was good. The ending just didn't fulfill the story.

In some ways we would see eye to eye, but in other ways we would be worlds apart.  After reading this book, I can see why mindset is so important and how it relates to career, parenting, and nearly every other aspect of life.  This book has helped me to make positive changes in the way I approach a mindset that I don't agree with and also be open minded to the differences in individual mindsets.  I would also recommend the book [[ASIN:B008QQ9V6O Attitude - Your Best hope for Happiness (A look at the men who founded the Positive Attitude Movement)]] with additional help in this area.  I found them both through a Listmania list and I am so happy that I did!  Thanks, Carol, for sharing your research with me!

They are refreshing to my ears because they sound like a 70's flashback band with brand new ideas that are just tweaked enough to bring my brain some great noise candy!  Their 2nd CD I felt was just to dang short with not enough songs but what was on there was good enough!  Now we come to their third CD and I would have to say I ain't got no complaints because it is good great rock and roll to my ears with much of it reminding me of Queen!  So if you're an old codger like me and grew up in the 70's with that great era of music and lust and thirst for more.....here you go!  I call them like I hear them and I hear nothing but a good time!
B007B5EDEG|3.0|I wanted to read the Song of Ice and Fire series as an eBook on my iPad, and this set was the most cost-effective means of getting the 5 books, so I bought it. I won't comment on the books themselves at this stage because I'm only 10% of the way through the second book, except to say that I was inspired to buy the novels after watching Seasons 1 and 2 of HBO's Game of Thrones television series.<br /><br />The blurb for this ebook does not tell you that what you will receive (unless it has since been changed) is the content of 5 books packaged into one single eBook file. This has got to be one of the most most bone-headed decisions I have come across in a long while. I see one icon in my kindle reader that encompasses all five books. So I don't see the covers of the individual books as depicted on the paperbacks.<br /><br />Secondly, when you have an ebook that is nearly 5,000 pages long, things like trying to scroll to a particular page is not very accurate, and so on. It also means that if I want the eBook on my iPhone, I have to have the entire 5,000 pages on the phone etc.<br /><br />I realise on the one hand my gripe is not that big a deal, but on the other hand it was very frustrating to expect one thing and receive another. The reality is that the publisher has specifically had to go to the trouble of concatenating these books into one eBook rather than just supplying the ebooks separately as you would get if you bought them separately. And I can think of no good reason for doing this.<br /><br />In the end, I discovered by chance that Amazon allows you to get a refund on your ebooks within 7 days of purchase, so I refunded the combined set and bought the eBooks individually. Yes it cost a little more but at least I now have a more manageable collection.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was an amazing book and I felt lost when I finished the last page. I finished it in one day and was up all night. It's well written; i laughed and cried during their journey to find each other. I recommend this book strongly! I'll read it again someday!<br /><br />And I'm in love with Travis. He's sexy, dark and protective. ;)
B005LMEB8E|4.0|Give Your Heart a Break is arguably the best song on the album but there are plenty of others that were nearly as good.
0393317552|1.0|The book was chosen by my book club and the subject sounded interesting. Unfortunately it turned out to be slow and repititious. It was like reading a bad text book or disertation. I forced myself to read about 150 pages and then I quit. Most of the members of my bookclub had the same reaction. One of the members found a 10 page synopsis on the internet. If the subject interests you I would recommend reading that instead.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great version of Picross (nonograms). Really well made and well thought out. Great colors and adequately challenging. Probably the best version I've played since Mario's Picross on the Nintendo DS. Highly recommended!

B005WUHAX8|5.0|LOVE this case!  It's sleek - not bulky and I feel safe knowing that my phone is protected.  I was conerned about the screen resolution being compromised but it is not at all and the touch is very responsive.  Highly Highly Highly recommend!! =)
B00003CXI1|5.0|Great price, new, never used.  I like the packaging and it was in perfect condition.  Good price for the two disc special edition.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Gets me accurate weather reports every time all the time. Easy to use interface is a breeze to work with and not too complicated.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|A7X- Waking The Fallen- What can I say? I love ALL of their work!! As I am typing this, I am hearing, in my head, Unholy Confessions... I love the combo of singing and screaming. The songs are haunting, alittle dark. They keep my interest. They keep me singing- loudly and umm sooo out of tune... Can't help it ;). If you are a fan of theirs, get all their cds. Check out Synyster's dad- Papa Gates aka Guitar Guy. He had some comedic cds out. He's hysterical & tells it like it is.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app helps me tell how much music time I have and creates a perfect way to check your battery
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game.  I got hooked when the regular CrossMe game was offered as the free app of the day and have been waiting and waiting for this one to be offered free.  Yesterday I could wait mo longer and purchased this app.  ARRRGGGGGG.  But I have to say, it is so totally worth purchasing.  It's a bit different than the regular one...a different line of thinking...but once you get used to it, it's just as fun!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I haven't heard about this tittle before but some viewers find this very interesting to watch this. If I had seen this movie in theaters I certainly know it was a terrific movie to watch on DVD and Blu Ray. Cowboys and Aliens seems like it came from a western and add Independence Day without Will Smith on his Hornet in the background. Harrison Ford And Danial Craig make a terrific duo as Cowboys facing opposing odds and Olivia Wilde few of them actually heard about her in a few movies but this one is hard to beat will all the special effects out there. I would highly recommend this to anyone but for those people who dislike this movie I don't even care that much of it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Overall, a great book!  Kept me guessing almost the entire read.  Only reason I did not give five stars was because of the ending.  Not that it was a bad ending; just wish it had turned out differently. Would highly recommend to anyone who really likes to figure out mysteries.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Brisinger book I purchased this month was delivered right on time!  I really have enjoyed this book , and you have excellent service!<br /><br />Sherry Voye, Minnesota

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator plus is simple and easy to use. The display is big enough to see without problems. This calculator works for the simple everyday task I use it for.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This show is awesome! One of the best TV shows I have ever seen. Each season comes up with more and more. The characters constantly evolve along with the circumstances. AMC is a great network that makes some great original series!!!! if you have not yet, watch this show.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Excellent book!  I followed the directions for publishing and had no problems.  I recommend reading it before you do anything.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I think this is one of the best series I've watched in a long time. I bought the first season on a special with amazon not knowing it was a series. I probably would not have purchased it if I had know it was a new series. I would have waited until it was into the third or fourth season. But after the first season I was hooked. The only draw back is waiting for the next season. You will not be disappointed when you watch this. It is really well done.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I've played this game the most on my of since I got it...it's that great! It's much better than any other story games. The only issue is, like all such games, you need gold to play the game unless you have a huge amount of patience. Gold must be bought with real money.<br /><br />You can invite your friends as neighbours of they have a Storm8 ID.<br /><br />This is a really good game, maybe the best by TeamLava.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book was delightful on so many levels - a life journey, an entertainment and a study of contemporary lifestyles.  Whether you read it as a supporter of pilgrimage or to enjoy Rachel's characterisations you will find it a pleasure.  It is well written and light but with many gentle nudges about how we live our lives!
B008D28HYS|1.0|Read the developer's 5 star review (sad) for a free cash prize of $100.00 for anyone who can prove this app sells a product or data mines. Considering ScoreLoop describes itself as a data mining company and that this program persistantly pushes their other game, it looks like free money!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great App! Really enjoy having the different translations available! The read back is great for driving. Now I have a ton of reference material at my fingertips!
1596177373|5.0|They are Tim Burtin playing cards from his book... need I say more? Normal quality of a normal playing card with awesome images.
0345479092|5.0|I'm a newborn and toddler Nanny and I try to get all my new parents to read this book.  Too many books out there trying to categorize babies by days and weeks as to where their achievements should be.  The Baby Whisperer just wants parents to learn how to read their infants signals and help them progress peacefully and successfully...both the parent and child.<br />Her writing style is light and amusing and helps parents to take one step at a time to learn.  She is not critical...simply observant and trains parents to be the same.  I have bought several books to hand to new parents as well as to parents having their second and third child.<br />A must read.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|this is the best strategy game (in my opinon) on the android market. i love how you can play with someone else in the room.
B007NESBK2|5.0|First of all, I must say that I can't understand how anyone who has watched this blu-ray can rate it less than 5 stars! I have always been a \\"casual\\" Sade fan, but I am a fan of good music. A friend of mine let me borrow this blu-ray, and I was blown away!!!  I had to order my own copy immediately! Sade's voice was awesome, and the band, lighting and presentation was awesome! It was just like being in the front row of a live concert!  So if you have a large 1080p HD tv, and a banging  surround sound system with DTS, this concert blu-ray is a \\"must own\\" for your collection! Simply said, this blu-ray is pure demo material!!!
0345803485|2.0|I tried for over a week to slog through this mess.  I know every one I know loved it, and went on and on about it...but really, I've read some much better, hotter stuff online.  And Anne Rice's erotica is far, far better.
B001EN71DQ|2.0|Pretty mad about this product. I'm sure somewhere in the details it may have warned me, but I saw the displayed product image and it shows the \\"I II III\\" of the episode trilogy box. But instead of getting the trilogy in a nice little box, the first three movies were simply taped together. Pretty cheap and unprofessional. Won't be getting my business anymore.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|at first I thought it wouldn't work but it corrected me and it worked! and it really helps me with my homework.
031262820X|2.0|This book was all over the place! I almost didn't finish it b/c it was very slow going and it didn't get good until the secrets were actually revealed. I get that the book is about secrets, lies, truth and forgiveness, but the side plots were unnecessary and it made the whole tone completely unfocused.<br /><br />I never sympathized with Millie b/c there was no good reason for her to keep such a benign secret and the way she handled herself was ridiculous.  While I understand that the Rupert and Alan angle had to be thrown in there to serve as the plot catalyst, the fact that there was no resolution between Rupert and Alan nor Rupert and his wife made me question the message that Wickham was trying to convey.  Then add in some random religious snobbery along with some questionable relationship choices that aren't incest per se, but really outlandish nonetheless.<br /><br />Every single main character in this book has more than one personal relationship that is troubled in one way or another. And the only relationship I was rooting for was the one between Simon and his father Harry. I loved Harry as a character and he seemed to be the only one that had any sense, though he wasn't perfect either.<br /><br />The story was a nice try by Wickham.  There were too many things going on and the ending was proof of this as she could not tie everything up satisfactorily.  The whole thing seemed to be a misguided mess.
B005UBNL0A|4.0|My old computer was exactly that:  Old!  It needed some serious work.  I was running an Athlon X2 6000+ and an EVGA 9800GT.  It was a great system back in the day!  But, time took its toll.  I was kicking around the idea of getting an Intel i3, since they seem to edge out this chip, and are competitively priced (I never overclock my equipment, so it's at stock settings.)  But the future upgradability seemed like it'd be very costly.  Over all, this chip performs just fine.  I mainly upgraded so I could play Diablo 3, and with an EVGA 550 Ti, I play it on high settings, and it looks as good as I could want it to look.  My old machine did just fine with standard productivity stuff, but I wanted to play games that were more recent than WoW.  I'm able to do everything I want, with no signs of a lag.  If I need to upgrade, I'm banking that the next generation of this chip will see some improvements (though the improvement I'm seeing from my last CPU is leaps-and bounds!)  The AM3+ socket will be around for a while.  Over all, this is a great chip, and easy on the wallet.<br /><br />**Update 9/6/12**<br />I recently purchased Guild Wars 2.  The game is fairly CPU-intensive, but the FX-4100 keeps up just fine!  I think I'm sitting at around 50% plus load at any given time during actual game play on all four cores.  I haven't had a single hiccup or spot of lag yet!<br /><br />Starcraft 2 is another CPU-heavy application, and coupled with the 550 Ti card, I'm running it on Extreme at 1400x900 resolution, and it's flawless.  Again, all four cores are loaded, and quite frequently, they're over 60%.  Things get a little warm (35C or so) when compared to when I run other applications.  Nothing to worry about!<br /><br />I have also paid quite a bit of attention to how it runs with Diablo 3.  It only uses 2 cores at about 50% load at any given time.  That game is more GPU-intensive.  I am still very happy with my purchase!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I LOVE this app and all but every time i try to shoot it just increases or decreases the size INSTEAD of shooting the birds. Seriously need that fixed. I cant shoot at all. PLZ FIX!!!!!!
0385366752|2.0|This book was too long, the writing was amateur, and the ending was the worst imaginable. I listened to the audio book over the three days following a minor surgery. I kept listening, just hoping something would happen to make the story better. I can only think that the audio version was better than the print version because the narration was really well done. Too bad the writing was not as good as the reading...
0345803493|5.0|This book was great, maybe better than the first! I finished it so quickly, and now I am on to read the third book. What an exciting series!
030758836X|1.0|I have little time to indulge in reading, and I so regret the hours I wasted on this collection of degenerates.  The language made Catcher in the Rye seem wholesome. There was nothing redeeming about this read in any way, and  I found the ending as disappointing as the reviews had warned.  How I regret the lost opportunity of reading something of (any) value.
0345803485|5.0|This book has greatly increased my mood! I finished this book in three days. I have just finished the second in a record two days. The series is wonderful- don't listen to these freaks saying that the writing sucks... I do not think her writing sucks. Everyone has a different writing style.

B00000J7J7|5.0|I'm not the first to ask - with respect to awareness of musical talent -- \\"where have I been all these years?\\"  But, where have I been?  A faithful collector of Jarrett, Ibrahim, Monk, Evans, Corea and so many others, I find their unique synthesis in this splendid album by Brad Mehldau, recorded over 12 years back in rich, ambient sound.<br /><br />If you enjoy any of the pianist/composers cited, you should simply order this gorgeous work. More thoughtfully, this disc reminds me of Jarrett's \\"Bremen-Lausanne Concerts\\" at their best, and without the vocalise, and on Corea's wonderful \\"Children's Games,\\" without some of the dissonance or tension.<br /><br />Those who love piano jazz often try to infuse their reviews with supporting comments from authoritative sources to support recommendations. I cannot do that, no more than I could have with \\"Children's Games.\\"<br /><br />This is an uncommonly well-composed, improvised and recorded disc, running about 55, which embraces the elegiac form. It is largely in a minor key, and reflects both the depths and resurgence, programaticallyy, this music has throughout history.<br /><br />I have no idea why it's been a sleeper.  I can only say that at this price, this exceptional disc belongs in the collections of any humane listener who understands, or wants to comprehend, the \\"literature\\" of loss.  It is not at all gloomy, although you will find some dissonance and minors.  If anything, it is a musical performance that reaffirms both our ability to understand loss and build from it.<br /><br />Music, along with other creative anchors, is pivotal for anyone who hopes to grow or rebound from empty space.<br /><br />Mehldau fills the space gracefully and beautifully.  10/10.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|There are several strong points to this film:<br /><br /> + The adaptation from the source material is about as good as one sees in Hollywood.  There are some questionable / unforgivable differences (e.g. how Katniss gets the Mockingjay pin...good grief!), but not so many as to annoy most readers too much.<br /><br /> + The soundtrack is simply incredible.  Taylor Swift brings the thunder in \\"Keep Your Eyes Open\\", but several of the other tracks are hauntingly beautiful or perfect in capturing the tension of the dystopian society or the horror and panic of the games.<br /><br /> + Art direction, costuming, and visual thematic elements are all engaging, eye-popping fun.<br /><br />I would like to give this movie 5 stars because I really enjoyed the books and based on the above points.  However, I am deducting one star because:<br /><br /> - The screenwriters and Josh Hutcherson just did not give Peeta the right treatment.  Every other character looked, felt, and acted about 80-100% like I would have expected from the book.  But the Peeta here is not the Peeta we know and love from the books.<br /><br /> - When we saw this movie with our friends who also read all the books, we entered the theater with jittery excitement and came out saying \\"well, what's for dinner?\\"  It was fine, but it's not a \\"wow!\\" experience.  It is a vague criticism, and perhaps due in part to my closing thought...<br /><br />Closing thought:<br />This is just a hard film to watch, in my opinion.  The subject is quite dark - starving families losing their children to participate in gladiatorial style games for the amusement of others.  So even though it is decently executed, I question whether this is a film I will watch over and over again.  For that reason, I recommend renting The Hunger Games before you buy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've enjoyed playing MobilityWare's Solitaire.  The navigation is easy and responsive.  I would say it would still be worth it even if the app cost a couple bucks.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is amazing. It will leave you on the edge of your chair the whole time. It is filled with a lot of serious moments, but perfectly balanced with many comical reliefs. It makes you cry and laugh all throughout the movie. There is a lot of action and surprises as well. They keep on making better and better movies!!
B001OGWY1W|2.0|I rented The Dark Knight on Amazon Instant Video and watched it with my projector. It loaded and ran fine but was definately not a quality recording. Reminded me of a Youtube video. I guess for only $1.99 I can't complain and if watching from a laptop or phone it would be OK.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is an interesting one by Cassandra Clare and by far one of my favorite books. Instead of some book that revolves around romance with immortals such as vampires or warewolves. It has to do with the people that kill them at times. I highly recommend this book to others.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|I MUST ADMIT THAT WHILE PAT METHENY IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, I WAS A LITTLE DISAPOINTED IN THIS RECORD. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING SOMETHING NEW, BUT FOR ME, I LIKE THE OLD PAT.  SORRY.<br /><br />STEVE HYDE
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|While researching my novel [[ASIN:B008G7L6TS Audrey's Guide to Witchcraft (Audrey's Guides)]] I read all the witch books I could get my hands on; this one definitely stands out as a particularly well-crafted gem. I love a well written paranormal tale, but many books in the genre seem sloppy and/or rushed. Harkness' deep knowledge of wine adds an unusual element, though you certainly don't have to be a wine lover to devour this book. The romance is sensual, the tension builds well, and the sentences are expertly crafted. It's got all kinds of spooky, gothic atmosphere as well. If you like books that blossom slowly and take their time, this one might just be for you.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Ghost stories are quite popular in England, probably because the weather and the winters give an optimal spooky atmosphere. The Woman in Black is just such a ghost story. It was first a novel, then made into a TV movie, a stage play, and two radio dramas before the release of this cinema version (which I saw on DVD).<br /><br />The story follows Arthur Kipps (played by Daniel Radcliffe), a young, widowed lawyer who has a four-year old son. He is still troubled by the loss of his wife. That has affected his work. The law firm sends him off to the North to settle the estate of Alice Drablow. She lived in Eel Marsh House at the end of Nine Lives Causeway. The causeway is only navigable at low tide. The house is full of paperwork that needs sorting to ensure the law firm's copy of her will is indeed the current one. This is Kipps last chance to prove he is serious about working for the firm. If he does not do well, he will be fired.<br /><br />He takes a train up to the town of Crynith Gifford. He meets a local man, Samuel Daily, who is quite rich (he owns the only car for miles and miles) and is friendly enough. The rest of the town is not so friendly because of the house's bad history and the local legend of the Woman in Black. She is mostly seen either by the house or on the causeway, but occasionally in town. Whenever she is seen, soon thereafter a child dies. Typically the death is a quite horrible one. Naturally the townfolk don't want anyone around the house. Kipps insists on going (to keep his job). As he researches through the papers, he uncovers information about the Woman in Black. Oh yeah, and strange noises and apparitions start happening too. And his son is supposed to come up on the weekend for a holiday!<br /><br />The movie centers on Kipps. It follows his investigation of the paperwork just enough to reveal the identity and motives of the Woman in Black. His character is well developed. His motives for staying are sensible enough and he is likeable enough that the viewer actually cares what happens to him. Developing an intelligent, sympathetic main character is critical in this type of movie. Radcliffe gives a great performance, subtle and nuanced without hysterics. He makes it more chilling.<br /><br />Much of the film shows him wandering through the house trying to look around corners for what just made that noise or what he just saw out of the corner of his eye. Plenty of cobwebs, dark corners, and creepy children's toys are made even more ominous by the low-key but highly evocative score. The atmosphere is great and delivers plenty of goosebumps. The story is interesting enough and the various twists are only occasionally predictable and always effective.<br /><br />The Woman in Black is a classic example of a haunted house movie, ranking with the best in that genre (The Uninvited, The Haunting, and The Changeling being the best).
B00004XMTJ|5.0|i just loved cats dvd musical. it was great and purrrrfect. i guess you could say it was the cats me-ow.<br />oh how i just loved it i just loved that musical when it first came out and now it is here now again to<br />enjoy and hear forever now thanks to you wonderful folks each and everyone of you there. i so thank you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|From the day I downloaded this app I couldn't stop playing... Now that I've completed all the levels, I've gotta find something similar! I loved every hour spent on this game!! It was challenging but very doable!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Although the film follows a Hollywood agenda it does it in an innovative cool way. The visuals of the film keep you watching it. Boundaries are pushed throughout the film. The directing and editing is flawless (for me!) and it's one that I will definately watch again as I'm sure there is much I missed the first time around.If you want to watch a fun film Kick Ass is perfect for you. The Blu-Ray version is great because it also comes with a DVD and a digital copy. This is NOT for kids. I loved that such a wild and crazy film could have so much heart.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I loved the monochrome version and I was honestly going to buy this one once I completed the other one, but this developer keeps updating the app with new puzzles.<br /><br />As the Amazon app of the day, this is a no brainer.<br /><br />I have nearly 100 games on my droid, and the mono version was easily played five times as much.<br /><br />The logic changes with multiple colors, as once you complete a chain of a color, there isnt necessarily a space between as there would be in the Mono version. Multiple colors can be adjacent, and this will bring new strategies and challenges.<br /><br />There may be permissions that make users uncomfortable, I simply do the puzzles for my own pleasure and do not post to social networks or log in.<br /><br />If you like puzzles, do not miss this one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|While this isn't the most complicated of platforms, it is a fun little compilation of interesting games.  all in all, it's. a fun game.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was looking for a nice romance novel to read this Summer and I came across this one so I read a couple of the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I could not have been happier that I found it! This book is amazing! It's one of those books that change your perspective, in my case I helped me to see life differently.  I loved each of the characters, they all seemed so real and all of them were interesting and had an important part in the story.  This book made me laugh out loud, cry and feel the frustration and happiness of the characters at different times.  It's a beautiful story everyone who reads it will keep with them for a long time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids really enjoy playing this game and competing with me for the high score. Its great for when we are on the road and in the car for hours. It helps to keep them entertained while we are out and about all day. The only downfall is it takes a long time to earn more money for new games in my opinion. But my kids love it just the same.
B004UA8D1O|5.0|This movie deserves more than 3 stars average. It's well made, good acting, good 3D. The story line is excellent. You won't be bored from the begining to the end. I'm not a diver nor am I interested in diving but this movie made me felt like I was there... It doesn't need blood and guts to get a 5 star rating. Excellent movie!!!
1451627297|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  What starts off as a sci-fi adventure turns into a tale of love and regret.  Well worth you're time.
B008D28HYS|1.0|I have the original since it was offered as a free app a while back. I liked it but the permissions change. I don't know why a single player game would need to have access to all accounts in my phone. Thanks you but I'll skip installing this one.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have found the second book even better and more spell binding than the first one. Every chapter ended with such intrigue that I had to read on. I'm so happy the love between Anastasia and Christian survived afrer the first book. Just goes to show REAL love is worth compromise.

B008602KQI|2.0|I read the Hunger Games a couple of months ago and waited impatiently for the DVD to be released, as it did not get a chance to watch it in the theaters. The book went into so much detail about the character's lives and their plight in District 12, and this movie did VERY little of that. I felt the movie took a few ideas from the book and then pieced together various action sequences. One of the things I loved about the book was Katniss' ability to survive everything thrown at her and to be resourceful, and the intuition between her and Haymitch. The book spent time talking about Katniss' struggle to find water and she wondered why Haymitch wasn't sending her water. Then it occurred to her that Haymitch was trying to tell her she must be close. The movie made Katniss' time in the arena look like a cake-walk. The story of her father teaching her to hunt and sing was barely eluded to in the movie. The relationship between Katniss and Peeta was not developed and left me wondering \\"why are we routing for these 2\\". In the book you fell in love with Peeta and Katniss on when she washed him, cleaned his wound, they took turns keeping watch in the cave, they were sent a feast by the sponsors--these moments were briefly skimmed over by the movie. They showed nothing about Peeta losing his leg or Katniss losing her hearing in one ear. These details are the reasons fans cheer for the characters, it's what leaves on the edge of our seat. The Hunger Games BOOK is great!!!!!  The Hunger Games movie-----VERY POORLY DONE!!!!!
B008D28HYS|4.0|This is an interesting game, but as you get into higher levels it's very difficult to play on a phone.  This is a better game for a tablet.  While you can zoom in on the screen, with larger puzzles you have to scroll around too much to be able to see all the clues.  It would also be nice if there was a hint feature for when you get stuck.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I borrowed The Hunger Games through the Amazon Prime lending program because it's received a lot of hype and plus there's a movie.  I had it on my Kindle for like two months before I finally sat down and read it.  I usually have a hard time liking books that have such a big reputation because my expectations are never met, but I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I read it in 24 hours, stayed up way too late because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I don't want to get into too many details because it's such a great adventure to read and discover for yourself.  That being said, it is a little violent.  Most of the violence happens \\"off screen\\" outside of the direct experience of the main characters, but the premise is a fight to the death, so...<br /><br />Anyway, the author does an amazing job narrating from the perspective of a teenage girl, Katniss.  Most of the story development is from her point of view.  I love the way Katniss develops through the story, seeing the world through teenage eyes, not knowing who to trust.  It's a completely believable unreal story, if that makes sense?

1401937519|4.0|Although I receive books from Hay House to review I actually purchased Dying To Be Me by Anita Moorjani.  I haven't read a lot of books on NDE (Near Death Experience) because they all seem to be similar.  However, Wayne Dyer highly recommended this book, so late one night out of boredom I purchased it via Kindle. I skipped right to the NDE part and was really intrigued by what I read so I decided to read the entire book.  The book really drew me in.  I found Anita's story very compelling.<br /><br />As I was writing this review, I realized how jaded I've become around certain events.  So I began to look at the book through the eyes of someone new to NDE's and realized this story is really amazing and worth taking the time to read!<br /><br />To give you a brief background, Anita was born in Singapore to Indian parents and grew up in Hong Kong.  On February 2, 2006 Anita's body began to fail due to the cancer that had been progressing for a number of years.  As her organs shut down, she fell into a coma.  Unaware of what was happening to her she realized she had never felt better and could hear and feel everything that was going on around her.  She experienced the emotions of her family as if they were her own.  She heard what the doctors were saying.  She was experiencing her own death.<br /><br />For most of her life Anita had lived with the fear of living up to the expectations of her culture.  She was fortunate to marry the love of her life but then within a short time span in the 2001 people close to her were diagnosed with cancer. She began to research the disease in an effort to help her good friend but the research made her begin to fear life itself as she began to uncover how many things have been linked to cancer.<br />Then into 2002 she was diagnosed with lymphoma after finding a lump on her right shoulder just above her collarbone.  For four years she suffered with the disease, trying different healing modalities during her travels to India.  She was evenpronounced healed after a lengthy Ayruveda retreat.  However, when she returned home the fear and negative responses from well meaning people around her began to reverse the effects.  Then in 2006 her organs began to shut down and she had her NDE as described above.<br /><br />During her NDE she experienced pure, unconditional love. She felt the presence of her father and good friend.  She felt their love and she was at last free of fear.  However, she made the decision to return when she realized everything in her life was perfect.  Once the decision was made her condition healed rapidly, almost instantly.  She required no additional treatment. She is now completely well and speaks on her experience and on the power of unconditional love and releasing fear.  To me, one of the best parts of the book was the question and answer chapter in the back.<br /><br />What I like about the book is that it doesn't place blame on the patient if they don't heal.  She is very clear on this point. If you have never read anything on NDE's, this is very good start. However, be sure to read it with an open mind.  If you are familiar with NDE's this book just reiterates the power of unconditional self love and the importance of releasing fear to live your fullest life. This is a very inspiring read!

B006QLH7O4|5.0|If you own a 3D HDTV, don't bother getting this movie in 2D, you're doing yourself a diservice.  This is hands down the best at home experience you can have with 3D.  And it's a must own for Final Destination fans or horror fans in general.  The clairity of the image is mind blowing with perfectly realized depth and creative use of \\"pop out\\" effects.  And the story is much better than the fifth entry of a horror franchise deserves.<br /><br />The opening hook of Final Destination 5 puts the \\"suspense\\" in \\"suspension bridge\\".  (I'm sorry.  That'll be me last attempt at humor.)  A group of coworkers load up on a Greyhound bus for a business retreat and a horrible disaster enfolds which our heros narrowly escape thanks to the requisite vision that always opens these movies.  We get our visit from horror icon Tony Todd who has been asbent since his voice only cameo in Final Desination 3, and all the deaths are painful to watch and not simply gorey.<br /><br />So if you love the Final Destination franchise and have been looking for a great 3D movie to get the most out of your 3D HDTV.  This is the movie for you.

1401207529|4.0|Frank Miller's Batman:  Year One is a great read.  A popular critique of this origin story is that it's not actually about Bruce Wayne becoming Batman so much as it's about Jim Gordon.  The truth is that it's more about them learning to trust each other and becoming friends and partners.<br /><br />The basic plot involves Jim Gordon transfering to Gotham PD and discovering that corruption runs the city and there's next to nothing he can do to change it.  Then Batman appears and he slowly begins to instill fear as he makes his way through the ciminal underworld and puts the architects of Gothom's corruption on notice.  Selina Kyle also features in the story, but only as a minor character.  Her inclusion is a nice treat though.  The artwork is beatiful and full of inky blacks and the story is compelling.<br /><br />It's a must read.  I also recommend The Long Halloween and Dark Victory.  They aren't written by Frank Miller, but they kind of act as unofficial sequels.  Those three collections make a great read one after the other.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|this is truly the only way to enjoy this movie. on the DVD you have to watch the special features in order to see the original IMAX sequences and even then it's not high definition so it doesn't look all that great. on the Blu-ray however, this is where things get interesting. Warner Bros. actually left the original IMAX sequences in with the movie, so when the black bars on the top and bottom of your tv disappear that is why. the audio is Dolby TrueHD: English 5.1 as well as a Dolby Digital: English 5.1 channel. plus the disc is so loaded with so many extras that they had to include a 2nd disc, and for the price even if you don't want all the extras you're still getting quite a deal.

B000051Y0G|3.0|I don't know why a lot of fans consider this album to be the best album from Cyndi Lauper. It's a very good record but it is not that perfect to be honest.<br /><br />Granted, it includes a lot of very good songs (Money changes everything, All through the night, When you were mine) and numerous hits singles (like smash hits Girls just want to have fun, Time after time and and the now legendary cult song She Bop) but I have to say that it also contains some fillers too (tracks 7 to 10 are clearly not as powerful and unforgettable as the first six). But I think it's amazing to see how this album still manages to sound as fresh today as it sounded almost thirty years ago).<br /><br />And what is also remarquable here is that, especially during the 80's, very few artists were able to release more than 3 very good singles from an album (like Madonna and Michael Jackson could) and Cyndi Lauper was among them (something really amazing, especially for a first album).<br /><br />What is really nice also here is that in this new edition, for the very first time, live versions of 3 songs have been included as bonus tracks. I must admit, I would have prefered to have Girls just want to have fun 7 inch single's b-side Right track wrong train or the main singles extended dance mixes instead because they all are very hard to find on CD but still, it's a very good idea to have them included here nonetheless.<br /><br />She's so unusual is a very solid first album where the songs will make you want to dance, think, cry or laugh but most of all, it shows the world the emerging talent of a unique singer, distinctive voice and talented songwritter. This album is also a promise of more amazing songs to come. Her next album True Colors is a little bit more mature in style than this one and I think that her very underrated 3rd album A night to remember will always be, at least to me, and still is to this day (2012) the best Cyndi Lauper album of all time.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Batman Begins is an excellent movie that does an outstanding job of \\"telling the story\\" of how Bruce Wayne became Batman
038572179X|4.0|Like many other McEwan's books, \\"Atonement\\" slowly tells a gripping story and creates tension with an implicit promise to relieve it at the end. The little sneak previews along the way help us keep turning pages. In \\"Saturday\\", when Perowne sees the two figures on the square sitting with their backs to him we know that they do not bode well. In \\"Atonement\\", when Lola shows her bruised wrists to Briony, her explanation that it was the result of the Chinese burns inflicted by the cruel twins clearly will not do. McEwan never disappoints and by the end of the book our hunches are confirmed and the mysteries officially resolved. If reading Pynchon's novels feels like white water rafting at night reading McEwan is like following signs to a museum in a foreign city.<br /><br />The three parts of the book, like the three layers of the cake, are very different and have their distinct flavors. The first, signature McEwan (comfortable life and internal disquietude), the third sparkling, O'Henry-style giving the whole book a twist, the second, a story on its own, a bit incongruous between the other two, rice pudding between layers of chocolate truffle: if extending Robbie's life in fiction was part of Briony's atonement, the love and squalor of the narrative do not seem to weigh enough in the balance.<br /><br />There is often something savagely dark in McEwan's novels. His characters are made to deal with the beast in themselves and others. And his readers are made to share this preoccupation with them.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|`Drive' really surprised me. I was never really interested in seeing this, I'd read the articles and seen the posters and ended up dismissing it, I only watched it because there wasn't anything else and didn't have high expectations. But, as it turns out, the film really blew my first impressions away. Instead of being bored, I found myself drawn into the film and caring for its characters, the acting was spot-on and Refn's direction made this movie a real gem.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling is Driver, a solitary guy who works as a mechanic and stunt car driver by day and getaway driver-for-hire at night, that is until he meets his neighbour, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son. The more time he spends with them, he falls for Irene in a somewhat romantic fairy tale....until it all comes crashing down when Irene's ex-con husband (Oscar Isaac) returns, bringing with him trouble and compelling Driver to protect Irene and her son from gangsters.<br /><br />What really stops this movie from becoming a cookie-cutter action-drama film is the fact that director Nicolas Winding Refn concentrates on giving us well-rounded characters. It's the characters that drive `Drive', not the action or the story and Refn's stylistic way of shooting it - with slow-motion and lingering shots of characters and still camera work - makes sure that what's unspoken speaks the loudest as he leaves it up to you to interpret their feelings and thoughts. It's not what happens when they speak, but more what goes unspoken through looks and body language. I don't know what you call it - noir or artistic or whatever - it's an approach that's been used by many directors before, but it makes `Drive' absorbing to watch.<br /><br />Of course, it wouldn't work without the actors giving top-notch performances and nobody lets the movie down here. Gosling is magnetic as Driver, conveying layers of emotion without uttering a word in some scenes. Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman also give stellar performances that make them more than one-dimensional villains. The one surprise for me was Bryan Cranston, I don't watch `Breaking Bad', but he proves he can stretch his acting chops far beyond quirky sit-com comedy characters. Carey Mulligan, Oscar Isaac, the criminally underused Christina Hendricks, all did admirably and were very believable in their roles.<br /><br />There are scenes of action throughout the film as well and they can be shockingly brutal, especially when compared to the mostly quiet tone of the film, one particular character's demise from a shot gun through a window will stick with me for a while and the car chases are tight and well executed.<br /><br />But this isn't an action film first, if I had to call it something, I'd say it's more like an artsy, character-driven drama. Whether you'll enjoy it or not probably depends on whether you think long, quiet, reflective scenes with lingering shots of characters staring at each other are thought-provoking and beautiful, or a director being self-indulgent and pretentious. Personally, I loved it because it engaged me emotionally and the cinematography work was stunning, this is one that stayed with me long after the credits rolled.

B008602KQI|4.0|......notice i said pretty good, not great. My reasons are that while it was a cool idea and the characters were interesting it just sort of felt incomplete. We have no idea how we got where we are..and if you didnt read the book youre missing a lot of the story. Still, that being said , i did like it enough to watch a sequel if one comes out...
0345803485|5.0|I figured I wouldn't like this book, usually I end up really only enjoying reading things that get at least 4 1/2 stars.  So I was surprised by how much I loved it.  I know other reviewers are saying how the characters aren't believable; I absolutely don't agree. I couldn't put the book down and can't wait to read the next, as I've heard it's even better than the first.  Be prepared for some wild ideas if you aren't used to that sort of thing.

B0056BU3I2|5.0|Fast and Furious Five has everything I could have hoped for. Lots and lots of sweet, beautiful action; clever plot; amazing set of actors; sweet ending; good movie length (it isn't short which is a big win); totally exciting. This is the movie that I will watch again, this is the movie that is a must for my collection. I can't wait for Fast and Furious 6. In my opinion this is the best of all Fast & Furious movies. Fast Five definitely has a shot at Best Picture. Amazing movie. I had no idea, Fast Five would be so awesome! Fast Five deserves every single dollar it has earned! There are so many new movies that aren't nearly as good as this one. Amazing.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Sad to see it end but Chuck is one of the best shows ever as far as action comedies go! The end kinda leaves it open for a movie, but I won't spoil it!
B005FJ7DOM|2.0|I don't have the movie but it was on TV & saw about half. I'm sure parts were cut but from what I saw this movie was so sad, especially when the pregnant girl was tortured & killed. Maybe it showed what it really would be like if something like that happened but I see enough horror on the news & watch a movie to get away from life. One person said it was like Zombieland & Dawn of the Dead. Have to disagree. Zombieland WAS a comedy, gross in some parts but funny with a good ending. But really, they have electricity but can't take a shower?  It's a fantasy, funny movie that I enjoyed.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book for many reasons, but here are my top five:<br /><br />1. It's very well-written without the dreaded I'm-so-literary pretensions, the narrative insightful without being pedantic.<br /><br />2. The plot is well-imagined but not convoluted, and carries a sense of threat without resorting to over-the-top descriptions of violence.<br /><br />3. The suspense begins on page one and continues to the end, with no \\"slump\\" in the middle.<br /><br />4. The characters are flawed yet somehow likeable in their own ways. (You know, like real people.)<br /><br />5. The form of the novel (two first-person narrators, neither of them a detective) is a fresh approach to an old genre (the mystery).<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this book five stars (I'd give it 4.5 if I could) is because of the treatment of one character. This character has what turns out to be a significant role in the plot, but not explored enough in the beginning and middle. More hints about the psychology of this character earlier would have made their actions later more believable.<br /><br />But this is a small flaw in what I feel is an outstanding book. If you like excellent writing and a clever mystery but are tired of the usual pro/amateur detective format, you'll like this book.<br /><br />A word about the ending: The fact that this book does NOT have a predictably slam-bang ending is part of its genius. The author crafted a story with characters who do what real people might do, not caricatures who follow a formula. A Hollywood ending would have diminished the whole novel.<br /><br />Oh, and a word about the narration: Some readers are really not comfortable with the \\"unreliable narrator\\" device. But it was a stroke of genius on the author's part to use it for this story. The reader realizes, little by little, that neither of the narrators are exactly what they seem. She turns page after page, and just when she thinks she's solved the mystery, something new is revealed and the plot thickens once again...ot thickens once again...

B008E374PO|4.0|Adam Young experimented with his style in the album before this, and it looks like the Midsummer Station album is still veering from his previous album's feelings. There are less lyrics in the content of this setlist compared to his earliest songs. The Midsummer Station comes back to the playful aspect of Owl City from All Things Bright and Beautiful's wistful and unattached-to-reality mood, though. (And there's no rap featured.)<br /><br />I will say, Adam seems to be using a lot more poppy fillers in his latest album. By this, I mean there are a lot more \\"oh, oh, oh\\" parts and less verses to some of the songs. It's not quite enough to be obnoxious, but just enough to take notice of. Still, if you're okay with Owl City becoming more and more popularized and getting more radio air-time, you'll still be a fan after The Midsummer Station. I know I am!

B001OY5X2Q|5.0|The only word I could think of to describe this album is intense because there's this gloomy atmosphere with either brooding offbeat ballads or post-punk melodic songs with Siouxsie diving into the vocal delivery each song. It's 9 songs on this album but there are a couple epic ones on here that clock over 6 minutes.<br /><br />This album has little parts of \\"JuJu''s punk spirit (with \\"goth\\" overtones), \\"A Kiss in the Dream House\\"'s psychedelic spin at times, but majorly this album sounds like a progression/step forward from \\"Hyeana\\". Robert Smith of the Cure's influence on the band must've been pretty big after being a band member and writing with them on that album because it seems like after he left, the band realized just how much they were capable of and how much they'd grown. Every song on the album is amazing and this is definitely one of their best albums.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks: the \\"Cities in Dust\\" alternate mix is very danceable while keeping the quirkiness of the band in tact. \\"The Sweetest Chill\\" alternate mix is more ambient/dreamy and almost rivals the version on the original album. \\"Song From the Edge of the World\\" is good enough to be on an album in my opinion, amazing song. The \\"Starcrossed\\" demo is amazing too; while not having the same quality in sound, it's an incredible song (the sound quality isn't terrible, just not the quality you'd find on the actual album).<br /><br />This is an excellent buy for all Siouxsie and the Banshees fans.<br /><br />New listeners could even start here to get a feel for the band or one of the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" singles compilations.<br /><br />Buy.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|This album takes me back to high school. I haven't heard some of the songs since high school but after I downloaded this I was surprised that I still remembered the lyrics.<br /><br />It's crazy, I can try as hard as I can to remember some stuff from high school with no luck. As soon as I was playing this album I had a flood of memories come back that I had forgotten. This album is crazy good. It literally defines my teenage years.<br /><br />This album is a must. If you like rock/alternative then you need this album. My personal favorite song is X.Y.U.
B008GOAFBQ|1.0|First of all, my review is focused exclusively on the quality of the remix of \\"Destroyer\\", not the songs or album itself, which is a 5 star Kiss Klassic. As you probably already know, \\"Destroyer - Resurrected\\" is the result of original producer Bob Ezrin remixing the album from the master tapes from the original recording sessions, to provide a new and updated perspective. Unfortunately, the results fall short. Very short. My hope and expectations were something similar to the recent Jethro Tull \\"Aqualung\\" remix, which was amazing. The Tull remix was transformational, taking what was a fairly compressed and tight sound, and opening it up to a host of sonic splendors. Listening to it was a revelation. Unfortunately, based on my intrepretation of the liner notes, it appears Ezrin was somewhat limited in what he could do, as he was working off a 16 track master in which several sounds were combined on each track. Accordingly, he was limited in his ability to actually remix many aspects of the album (for example, the drums). The result is a sound that I would best describe as an album that was \\"tinkered\\" with. Yes, there are some differences, such as the acoustic guitar mixed louder on \\"Beth\\". But the differences do not come across as being based on a new artistic vision, but rather the need to simply \\"change\\" something to create this product. The bottom line is that when it was discovered the master tapes that were available combined various instruments and sounds on the same track, this project should have been scrapped. But it wasn't, and what resulted is pretty lame. And that is a shame, because I think Bob Ezrin is one of the all time great producers of the 1970s and 80s.

B008BM9L72|2.0|I was tempted into buying the Fifty Shades books.  I bought the Trilogy on Kindle.  All excited I started reading.<br /><br />All I can say is being an avid reader of books, I was highly disappointed.  I knew it was an erotica read, and I was prepared for all the sex scenes.  However, I was not prepared for the lack of story in the book.  It was one sex scene to the next.  I forced myself to read to the end of the first one, curious to find out why Christian was the way he was and what happened in his past.  When book one ended \\"just like that\\" I thought I would continue with Book 2.  Halfway through.... I thought it wasn't worth the pain and frustration to carry on reading.  How can women enjoy a book that promotes a woman accepting a man taking over her world and acting like a neanderthal, possessive and abusive?  I don't care how \\"hot\\" he was or rich or what sexual skills he may have.<br /><br />I think been a fan of writers like Jodi Picoult, Richard Montanari and Paulo Coelho, this did not hold a candle to the literary enjoyment I have had in the past.<br /><br />I know many ladies who have enjoyed the book and have read them more than once.  And all I can say, these ladies don't read serious books and want to escape into a world of sexual fantasy.<br /><br />Go ahead, read it - at your own discretion.  But if you are an avid reader of serious books, whether crime, thriller or drama, this may disappoint you.<br /><br />Oh and over and above all this....... If Anastacia had to bite her lip or say \\"Oh my\\" one more time, I was going to climb into that book and slap her into the real world.

0345803485|5.0|I'm a long-time writer myself, but I thought it was a riveting book! BDSM is not the important thing in the story. It's nothing I'd ever even remotely consider in my personal life. What IS important is that the protagonist, Ana, makes a huge, ongoing effort to be who she is and not cave to this powerful, controlling, deeply flawed man in such a way that she loses her core self and values. Yet, she adores him with a love equally as powerful as her self-love. This constant, internal struggle is what is familiar to most of us, especially those with controlling, distant fathers and husbands. Author James has succeeded, also, in making Christian Grey (who admits he is 50 shades of effed up) a totally captivating, multi-faceted man who makes us privy to his own internal struggle. He fiercely loves Ana, though can't admit it to himself because he has no experience with being loved and has no clue what that is. Add to that the enormous attraction of unlimited wealth, an ability to go, do, buy without checking cost, and a penchant for lavishing expensive things on Ana, usually against her will. There is a vast moral underpinning to this novel, though the BDSM is what gets the press. We women identify with all she goes through in a society which still wrongly defines us as second class, with no power over own lives. E L James found all the right buttons to push.

0553062182|5.0|I can list only a couple of books I have read that have truly revolutionized my life, and The Highly Sensitive Person is one of them. As a result of reading this book, I have transformed an important relationship with someone in my life whom I always wanted to love but who I have misunderstood and often found to be quite difficult, even for me, to understand. I am excited to say--that new friend I have found is myself! Thank you Elaine Aron for this wonderful and important book.<br />Donna Newcomb, La Crosse, Wisconsin
B008BIN9EW|1.0|Don't waist your time by installing UniWar.  Its a super cheesy strategy game.  Awful graphics accompanied with poor/limited gameplay.  Only tried it as the free game of the day.  Whoever rated this higher than 1 star I would consider insane or someone promoting to download/purchase THEIR junk.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|I wasn't expecting a fairytale. Anyone could see it wasn't going to be a fairytale so please don't try and tell me what was in my mind as I began to read. I am an English teacher and will still recommend the trilogy to my pupils. The first two books are good and keep you on the edge of your seat, even the first two thirds of this book did the same.<br /><br />There may be spoilers in what follows as I can't really be bothered keeping them out.<br /><br />My main problem seems to be what a lot of people have an issue with: the ending. It's rushed, let's be honest. I can accept Katniss is changed because of subsequent Hunger Games and war. However, nothing is tied up properly: it's just sloppy. For example, Finnick dies in one line. What is the point in building up a character that will do everything to save Annie, bring Peeta back to life in the arena, fights his own depression to continue saving Annie in order for him to die in one line. It's poor writing from an author that kept me hooked for two and a half books.<br /><br />Also, everything happens while Katniss is asleep, drugged, depressed, hiding or moaning. The whole point of a first person narrative is that you get to experience the action along with the character not so that you get to read the newspaper with her. If I wanted to just listen to depressing news, I'd turn on the TV. Again, this is just sloppy writing from an author who I expected much more from. It is almost as if she got told, \\"we want your book in 2010 rather than 2011 so can you make the ending come quick?\\" and rather than telling them where to go so she could keep her integrity, she accepted a bonus and ended it quickly. I hope this is what happened, because if she chose of her own accord to end it this way while not tying up the loose ends properly then she became a very poor writer overnight, which is clear from books one and two she isn't.<br /><br />I'll end my rant on this; I have given three stars purely on the basis that the trilogyis enjoyable. It is worth reading and if you get halfway through 'Mockingjay', you just can't stop: it'd be pointless. Collins still could've given us the ending she wanted, I just wish she had done it properly.

0312427999|1.0|To have such a simplified view of the world that you confuse Milton Friedman with neo-conservatives is unfortunate, but typical of the middle-school, from crayons to author, mentality in America today. Before purchasing this book, you should take the time to read a thorough review from Johan Norberg at Cato. Many libertarians don't even consider Friedman a member of the libertarian club, but a neo-con? wow. Bizarre!

0062068423|3.0|The 3rd Harry Hole novel, though the first to be translated for the English-speaking market (Hole is a policeman in Norway and Nesbo is one of the best-selling authors in Scandinavia). A long and difficult slog to get through (it literally took me about 5 weeks to finish). Jumping back and forth between WWII and the present day (in this case, 1999-2000), the book was far too leisurely in the way it developed its central mystery. I'd read a lot of good things about Jo Nesbo and had high hopes for this book, but now I'm wondering if I should read any more of the Harry Hole books or not. It will probably be a while before I give them another chance.

0553386794|5.0|I'm coming to this after having watched the first two seasons of the HBO television series--it's a bit like reading the complete version of a Readers' Digest condensed novel. It's really amazing how true to the book the writers of the series were able to be. The book is a more fleshed-out version of what showed up on the small screen, but that was already a memorable story. Here in the book, it's all the more rich and detailed. This is really good stuff, though I'm a bit worried that Martin may have bit off more than he can chew with this grand story and may not live to tell all of it...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so addicting!!!!!!!!!! luv it so much its simple in the beginning but it becomes more challenging ad u go along
0385344228|4.0|Pretty good book, about a lawyer father, who comes from a background marred by violence, who has developed a blind eye to some of his own son's faults, so that when said son is accused of the murder of a classmate, his father simply can't see the possibility that perhaps his son had some part in the crime. There's mystery here, but it's also a very detailed portrait of a trial, as well as a chronicle of a family pulling itself apart at the seams. Very effective (and sad) conclusion.

0553801473|2.0|This is the fifth book in a series.  I first saw the video of Game of Thrones and was hooked so I bought the book which really cemented my interest in the Starks and the Lanisters.  I couldn't wait to read the next book which had many surprising twists that led me to the third book which I enjoyed but not as much as the preceding volumes.  I struggled with the fourth book but did finally finish it and I purchased the fifth book which was so slow and dull that I quit reading after 600 pages -- I might ultimately finish it but I'll wait and see.  I became entranced with Ned and Catelyn Stark and their Children Sansa, Robb, Bran, Arya, and Rickon.  Tyrion Lanister was easily the most interesting character I have encountered in a long time.  Cersei and Jaime Lanister were equally fascinating as was Brienne.  But Martin killed off Ned and Catelyn Stark and that was just the beginning.  By the time you get to Dances with Dragons Robb Stark is murdered, Arya has disappeared into some sort of religious order but her status is unresloved. Jon Snow has gone off fighting Zombies of all things and his story just gets duller and duller.  Bran seems to be headed into some sort of weird status as a \\"changling\\" or a tree -- undetermined.  Rickon Stark just vanishes from the story.  Tyrion's story just drags on and on with no resolution and his ultimate fate is not resolved.  Jaime seems on the cusp of redemption with Brienne but his story is left hanging and whether or not Brienne was killed is left open.  In short all of the characters who made the story interesting are either killed off or left hanging for what surely must be book 6.  To make matters worse books 4 and 5 could easily have been reduced to 300 pages each by simply dropping all of the tedious descriptions of clothes and food.  Plus more and more characters are introduced who lack any of the interest of the original characters.  I found myself skimming through whole pages of descriptions that did nothing for the story.  I started skipping all of Jon Snow's battle with the zombies as being simply too dumb to accept.  At that point I realized I was done and no longer cared about any of the characters.  A great start to a wonderful series but it deteriorates into a very poorly written soap opera about people I don't like and have  no interest  in.  It is a dull and tedious end to what could have been a great story..  I started skipping all of Jon Snow's battle with the zombies as being simply too dumb to accept.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie!  People will criticise the movie for bland acting from the seals, but they are not actors...they are active duty navy seals.  The action sequences are rivoting and keep you on the edge of your seat.  As former army, I understood the jargon, but many may not and may find it hard to keep up with.  I have the highest regard for this film and recommend with 5 of 5 stars.  Enjoy!
B008E374PO|3.0|I watched Owl City's \\"Making Midsummer Station\\" video.  Now he has a label and co-writers, and he says in the video it helped him take the egotism away from solo song-writing and self-recording.  But let's face it, Adam was doing fantastic on his own, and I loved watching his videos on creative process when \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\" was released.<br /><br />The album is still great, don't get me wrong.  His poetry is still exquisite and \\"Silhouette\\" still has his flare and originality.  But a lot of the tracks sound like mainstream boom-chuck music that DJs play in clubs.  His old music had a little bit of that, but now it's on almost every track.  I'm not saying he shouldn't integrate and become more mature in his song writing, I just have a feeling that the dollar signs were in the eyes of the label.  Boom-chuck music is huge, and the album was sucked right into this realm.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its awesome and was really useful and easy to use. I take my kindle everywhere &amp; to have this app makes adding up my shopping easier.
0345803485|1.0|I read the book and I can't say I totally hated it but I was expecting something better. I congratulate the author on having the courage to write a book and that the book is a success. That said, I was expecting a lot more from the book. I thought the writing was just not good and my first language is not even English. Even the sex scenes became \\"old\\" and repetitive. I did not like the character of Ana and was exasperated by the constant mention of her \\"inner goddess\\". Her character was specially unrealistic. Little Miss Perfect, immature, ridiculous and many times plain stupid. Bottom line, she was attracted to a hot, good looking, sexy, millionaire. That is what she really loved and who wouldn't at first. She was star struck. The relationship between the couple did not seem like love to me but just a powerful sexual, physical connection. She was treated like a five year old and a possession. It is like an accident waiting to happen with Christian's controlling, exaggerated outbursts in need of anger management. Half the time she was scared of making him angry. Repetitive words and expressions made the reading tedious at times but overall an easy read. Instead of the actual cover I just imagined one of those romance novels with Fabio on the cover. Cheesy book!

B005IQZB14|4.0|This was our book club pick for the month, or I don't think I would have read it.  The writing and story pulled me in right away.  I love how Cheryl weaves the story from present to past.  There were times that her writing about hiking made me want to skim the page, but then the story would pick up again and I would be engrossed.  I love her bond with Monster, the backpack. It is appealing to have everything you need strapped to your back.<br /><br />This is a beautiful account of her relationship with her mother, and her family.  What it takes to face our fears, to be alone.  So many of us yearn to do something drastic with our lives, but we never do. Fear sets in and cripples. Cheryl shows us that we need to do the hard things in life, to push ourselves, to face our fears.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Great plot, well written, crisp dialog, and a terrific new character in Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) Warrant Officer John Puller--A true individual army of One. I noticed quite a few reviewers have slammed Mr. Baldacci for stealing Lee Child's mega character Jack Reacher and repackaging him as John Puller. I strongly disagree! Jack Reacher is one of my favorite literary characters, and in John Puller Mr. Baldacci has done a terrific job of creating Reacher's literary doppelganger. I do not view this as literary plagiarism, but rather a selfish opportunity to read twice as many great stories concerning the Reacher/Puller mystique: How can anyone logically argue with that--in the end is it not all about the story?! I sincerely hope Mr. Baldacci will write more novels with the John Puller character as this will give ME many MORE hours of enjoyable reading.<br />Yep, John Puller is similar to several other detective action hero types: The aforementioned Jack Reacher and of course Paul Brenner of Nelson DeMille literary fame. In Baldacci's Zero Day we are introduced to John Puller, a highly decorated combat Ranger and tough as nails Army CID Investigator. He is considered by the Army to be their best criminal investigator. He is assigned SOLO to investigate the horrific death of a DIA colonel and his family--A most unusual investigative army protocol. But then this is a most unusual case as Puller soon discovers. Working with the local female police investigating sergeant, Samantha Cole, soon more deaths occur as the case becomes more and more strange. Nothing is what it appears on the surface and makes no logical sense. Puller uses all his investigative wiles and soon he and Sam Cole are on the hunt for the brutal killers.<br />Ill Stop there Gush Gush ...........
B004LWZWBU|3.0|Jack Black, Steve Martin and Owen Wilson are in one movie, but despite the three names in the leading roles, \\"The Big Year\\" was hardly a commercial success, reaching 9th place in the U.S. box office charts in its first week. But is the film so bad? Directed by David Frankel (\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\"), the film has some nice moments, though it seems the director is not really sure what to do with the unique subject matter - the Big Year - as if being afraid of offending anyone.<br /><br />Doing a Big Year is the ultimate dream for every birder - viewing (or hearing) as many different kinds of birds as possible in a specific area, like across North America. This means that three characters thirty-something computer programmer Brad Harris (Black), a big company's CEO Stu Preissler (Martin) and the current record holder Kenny Bostick (Wilson) will be chasing more than 700 bird species, from the Gulf Coast area to Attu Island.<br /><br />This may be a great idea for film on paper (\\"The Big Year\\" is based on Mark Obmascik's book of the same title), but to turn it into a good film you need a good story, which \\"The Big Year\\" does not have. Many talented players appear - Anjelica Huston, Rashida Jones, Tim Blake Nelson and Dianne Wiest, to name a few, but they are given little to do in the film. Only Brian Dennehy as Brad's father and Rosamund Pike as Kenny's wife are memorable.<br /><br />But the biggest disappointment is the three leads, whose characters and stories remain bland at best. With these talent players, the filmmakers could have made a low-key drama, a romantic comedy, a farce or even a satire. Well-acted and beautifully-shot, \\"The Big Year,\\" either as a comedy or a drama, simply fails to find its own voice other than the interesting subject matter. The film is a pleasant experience, but there is a much better film buried in its premise.

B0081TZUAW|5.0|This new Album, especially on second listens, is pure 'garbage' (in a the good way).<br />When I first heard some of the samples off Garbage's new album I'll admit I was unsure, when I First heard their lead single Blood for Poppies, I thought to myself 'there's the classic Garbage sound we all love'.<br />But on first listen to the album, I felt like it was over-produced, sell out garbage for the gaga generation. But then I couldn't get the intro of Blood for Poppies out of my head, so I figured I'd listen to all the songs on youtube and see if maybe I was too hasty, turns out I was. This Album is Classic Garbage, sure it sounds a bit different, but every Garbage album has had its own unique identity, and all the things that make this band great are still there, catchy rifts, ironic meaningful lyrics, and songs that just make you smile, or want to sing along, all in all, this album is great and I foresee it being stuck on loop in my car, and at work for a good time to come.<br /><br />If you love Garbage, you wont be disappointed, just need to give the album a chance and not judge it entirely at first listen.
0345803507|3.0|OK, have now read all 3 books. Numbers 2 and 3 are about 75% of number 1. In other words pretty much non stop sex with one or two pages of actual story line thrown in. Also the repetitious phrasing continues throughout so get used to it. Lips in thin line, tendril of hair behind ear, lip biting, grey eyes darkening, etc. These books are like chocolate cupcakes piled high with chocolate butter cream icing. You know they are bad and will be full of empty calories but you can't resist and eat them anyway. And then you feel really good. One last observation....I do not know what planet Christian is from but it's NOT Earth. No man I EVER heard of can have on demand sex 5 or 6 times a day, every day,  WITH ejaculations! I'm convinced he was secretly mainlining Viagra.

0007466064|4.0|Unfortunately I was too hasty in ordering this book and didn't realize it was only the first half of Book 5 of A Song of Ice and Fire.

B008D28HYS|3.0|Let me start off by saying this is a great game. It is a real brain teaser and adding in the color feature makes it more difficult but also interesting. This is a very nice game and I like the addition of the colors into this version, it adds a new level of complexity and variation to the game.<br /><br />It is a 5 star puzzle app. It does include Scoreloop in the game that is added as an option and I strongly recommend not activating Scoreloop for multiple reasons. Some of which I have listed below. I don't believe any puzzle or game app should encourage wagering on games for children 13 and older and buying fake money with real cash/credit.<br /><br />I deducted one star for the difficult playability in the larger matrix puzzles and one star for including Scoreloop in the game for any reason. They are pushing sharing of your score but most people would rather have their privacy than share scores on a game they play for entertainment.<br /><br />The Game:<br />This is a Japanese style color puzzle where you have to figure out which squares are filled in and what color they should be. It starts off easy but it gets harder quickly. The first page you see upon opening the app is a tutorial. The second thing is the Scoreloop logo.<br />If you solve a puzzle you get a screen that asks you to Tell Friends via email or Facebook.<br /><br />The menu takes you to the list of puzzles in that level and there are 8 levels to challenge you. On the main menu you can select Play, Tutorial, Get Original or Settings. Get Original takes you to Amazon Appstore to the page of the same game, but not in color, to try to get you to buy it. I have never had an ad pop up to try to sell me the game yet. If you press Get Original it will take you to Amazon but I have not gotten any pop up ads on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Settings helps you to set the music on/off, view Time and Battery in the game, have Doubling Numbers or About which takes you to the app data screen. You can Zoom and Pan screens with your fingers. You will need this feature as the tiles get smaller as the number of tiles in the matrix increases. This is hard to play on a Kindle Fire and I cannot imagine what it would be like trying to play on a smaller smart phone. In the advanced mode the matrixes are 32 by 32 tiles. You would have to zoom into the picture so much that you lose all perspective of what the picture really is beginning to look like. On a phone without using zoom you would have to use a needle to touch one tile. Playability gets tough if not impossible quickly.<br /><br />Scoreloop:<br />By touching the Scoreloop logo you are asked to enable it. My suggestion is to not enable Scoreloop. You can touch and read the terms of service for Scoreloop. It is a long document which is a binding contract and Scoreloop has all of the rights. You can play and challenge other players in games. You can see a list of games associated with and having Scoreloop installed. You can view scores of other people on the games and earn coins (Game Points).<br /><br />You then can challenge and wager your coins to play another player with your coins at stake. Scoreloop determines the winner and the winner receives 75% of the coins and Scoreloop retains the other 25%. The loser just loses their coins. As you buy new games you can earn more free coins from Scoreloop or their partners. There is no obligation to give you these free coins.<br /><br />You can register your data into your Scoreloop account which registers your device also. By registering and clicking accept you have signed a binding contract. You can now purchase coins on Scoreloop and supply your address and billing/payment method. You can also buy coins through third parties like an Appstore. You must be at least 13 years old to join Scoreloop.<br /><br />Scoreloop never distributes money and you cannot claim any value for the coins you own. Scoreloop has the power to investigate fraud in game playing and take your coins away. Coinscan also expire after three years after their acquisition.

Meanwhile is wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) plays one of the most lovable roles and sexy roles of her career.  The movie is entertaining, action filled and enjoyable and I recommend it to you.

B008IZ6E6I|5.0|Dexter has been using the severed hand of Gellar to make everyone think Geller is still alive.  Even though he is hiding evidence from the police he is still trying to stop Wormwood. Dexter's anonymous tip to the police leads them to the Ricochet Rabbit Yacht where they find traces of the ingredients for poison gas and two dead bodies.  They realize that one of the bodies is a suspect that one of the homicide officers went to visit and that the officer is not at the crime scene.  All available units are scrambled for a probable code 40 to the dead suspect's home.<br /><br />Dexter realizes that if he is to catch Travis that he must draw him out and trap him.  He decides to create a spectacle so bizarre that it makes the daily TV news cast and Dexter sends a video to Travis taunting him.  There is an indication in the video of where Dexter is at.  The Doomsday Killer has already claimed three victims and he is not done yet. He wants to kill the Beast, the false prophet....<br /><br />This episode is building to the climax of all the events of the season, the Doomsday Killer's finish to the apocalypse, Debra's issues at work and her feelings for Dexter and Dexter's desire to rid Miami of the Doomsday Killer.  This season has moved quickly and you just have to keep on watching each episode to see what happens next.  This is a great episode and I recommend it to you.
0316098515|5.0|This production is fantastic. A guide for restaurant workers and people who just love food. I will use it and learn from it for a long time.
B00026ZG10|5.0|Henry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is never at home as his job as a computer sales man always keeps him busy.  That is just one of the many lies that he has told his wife.  He is really a mission specialist for the US Government working on a counter terrorism task force.  He is so busy he even misses his birthday party that his wife and daughter have set up for him.<br /><br />Harry goes to his wife's office to take her to lunch and inadvertently finds out that she is seeing someone and perhaps she is having an affair.  Using his surveillance skills he tracks down the man and he sets up a plan to trick his wife into telling the truth about what is going on....<br /><br />This is a hilarious action comedy that I just loved.  Arnold is up to his neck with an Islamic terrorist group that has weapons of mass destruction and plans to use them.  Meanwhile is wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) plays one of the most lovable roles and sexy roles of her career.  The movie is entertaining, action filled and enjoyable and I recommend it to you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a major disappointment after all the hype about it. This is basically a \\"chick flick\\" in book form. I certainly won't purchase the other books in the trilogy.
B000O78KW4|5.0|John Mc Clane (Bruce Willis) is having continued issues in his life.  He is in New York City and he is still having issues with his wife and he is on suspension at his police job over a drinking problem.  That is not the worst of it.  A terrorist bomber who calls himself Simon is back in the business of chaos as a bomb blows up in a department store.  Simple Simon demands to the police that Lieutenant John Mc Clane be called back into the case and Simon wants to play a game called Simon Says with John Mc Clane.  If Mc Clane doesn't do what he is told then more bombs blow up.<br /><br />John is told to go to Harlem and wear a derogatory sign that is sure to get him killed.  That is just the start of John's problems.  Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) helps save John's life and as a result he becomes the unwilling partner in the adventure planned by Simon.  John and Zeus are under constant time and mental pressure from Simon.  On top of that, the FBI tells him the ID of Simon who is the brother of Hans Gruber, the man John threw off of the skyscraper in the first Die Hard.<br /><br />This is a fast action film with John and Zeus being given impossible tasks that they have to complete to save lives.  John figures out Simon's plans but how to stop him is another problem.<br /><br />I love this Die Hard series of movies and I feel that Bruce Willis is the perfect actor for this character.  He has the right charisma and attitude to pull this character off and keep you cheering for him to survive.  You will feel sorry for John in this movie as he is abused by Simon and cheer for him in the end.  This is a good movie and I really enjoyed it.  I recommend it to you.
B0016NF06O|1.0|Willie's honky-tonk just doesn't resonate with Marsalis' New Orleans jazz. I had imagined that Willie had enough left in the tank to make more of a modulation, but that turns out not to be true. While I have long appreciated the heart crushing sentimentality of Willie Nelson's products, I had also assumed more musicality than he shows in this CD.  Marsalis is one of the greatest trumpet virtuousos in jazz at any time and he did his best to bend for Willie.  It just didn't work.<br />I think the suits got excited over the respective public images of these guys and counted profits before they considered the music. That shouldn't work.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Too often the FAOTD is a glorified sales pitch, crappy physics data miner or underperforming app that developers are hope will find an audience (see tween-to-teen group).<br /><br />CrossMe &amp; this app are neither. I enjoy immensely the challenges of nanograms &amp; their sometimes quirky payoffs (some of the pictures are priceless; the smashup of Napoleon and Pocayoyo, for example) .<br /><br />WTG, Amazon.  You got this one right and saved me an inevitable 4.95, seeing as how I was almost finished with CrossMe.<br /><br />Thanks!!!
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Charming and witty, this film should be running on a loop in commune movie rooms everywhere.  I only wish they had more outtakes.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I love the game and rated 5 stars but I was playing, exited out of the game, and logged back on and all of my characters and skills and everything were gone... gameloft PLEASE FIX THIS:(
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Built this up with a  Core I3-2120T, 2X 2.60GHZ, 2 2TB drives and 8GB Ram with Ubuntu Server 12.04.<br /><br />Very easy to setup, Just drop the CPU, memory and Drives in and your ready to go.<br /><br />The heat pipe for the CPU came with thermal paste which was great.  I didn't need the CPU fan that came with the CPU.<br /><br />The box is dead silent and clock in at about 25 Watts idle with the 2 drives!  It bumps up to 30 Watts under load, so this is a very efficient setup.<br /><br />Not using any of the multimedia stuff on it yet, but as a basic low power build machine it is very good.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|this movie features a lot of useless killing, and very little of anything else. The plot is weak to absent outside of the kids having to kill each other to survive. This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in years. In place of good camera action and character development there is overdramatic death scenes that just seem to be created out of this air without reason or plot flow. And then it just ends, no real plot tie up just
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app helps me to know exactly how much charge i have left. I use my kindle often for everything. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B005LAIH54|3.0|I must agree with some other reviewers whose low expectations of the film affected their enjoyment of it.  I found this to be Clash of the Titans on acid because of the extended action scenes.  It was a bit too much but still effective as a fantasy adventure.  Liam Neeson is very effective as Zeus.  Enjoy your self and do not cloud the issue with facts or lofty expectations.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Enough has been said about this flick, but I will reiterate the key points:  The quality of the blu ray video transfer is outstanding, lots of detail, and fantastic slow mo capture where it matters.  great music.  Brilliant action shots.  I couldn't ask for more, this footage is a treat every time I watch it! And I'm not even a snowboarding fan!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game it tests u and ur on the go left and right. its a good game i guess u could use it as a family game.
B005HSL626|3.0|needs improvement because the ipad version is way better because you can get starfruit and more awesome blades it would be better if it was updated
B0086700CM|5.0|I understand that it's boring to some but to me it's an addictive game that can really be challenging without focusing... so it's for really competitive people that have a feeling they can make it... it's just they're not trying hard enough.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|A compelling read!  Many twists and turns go forward in solving these crimes, introducing the reader to an array of interesting characters.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. It works great if you need to jot down a quick note, and even works if your writing a story! The calender works awesomly too. it lets you color code your notes also. Plus its free! What more could you ask for?
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I love Angry Birds &amp; bought the paid versions of all for my KF so I did not get the ads.  I gladly paid the 2.99 for space.  Imagine my surprise when all the recent updates have all these IAP's.  I am all for paying developers for all their work but it seems like Rovio is starting to get greedy.  Having to pay extra for the levels in Danger Zone (AB Space).  Really????!!!!!  Are you forgetting the people that got you where you are today?
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is really addictive and really fun! I recomend getting it as long as you are ready to play it a lot!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have to say that I was extremely dissappointed.  First of all it took me until I was 1/3 into the book before I decided to go on.  I almost quit readingt it several times just because the reading was very boring.  Then it got really exciting and stayed that way through the rest of the book.  However, I was extremely dissappointed by the ending.  I hate an ending that leaves you hanging!!!  All in all I wished I hadn't wasted my time.  I have one more book to read by this author.  I'LL Give the author one more chance.
B00881VLCE|5.0|great way to do puzzles without worrying about the kids running off with the prices. I enjoy puzzles and as a mom of three this is great! highly recommended to puzzle lovers

B008D28HYS|5.0|It's just like the original CrossMe but with an extra twist of color, makes solving the puzzles slightly different... love these games!
034580404X|5.0|Was well worth the money.I love these books.I wish there was more.I can't wait til the movie comes out.don't hazeatate buy the books.I can just set and read books.but with these after I got them I couldn't put them down.
B008D28HYS|1.0|Permissions should be limited to what the app needs in order to run. This is ridiculous. FAOTD should be renamed:  your 4x/week offer of privacy invasion.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you play the Game Of Thrones... Well... That's definitely worth getting into. The way in details this fantasy world gets described, really get you away thinking \\"this could have been real.\\"<br /><br />I am reading it on my Kindle. And with english not my being my native language, I often use the Oxford english diary to look up the old medieval words used. And by doing so, I can see how much work that has been put into these books.<br /><br />Actually, I'll think I'd get a horse and go jousting in a tourney.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good waste of time. it doesn't hurt that the game is free either. ive had no problems with the app.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|This is an insightful and well-written book.  I agree with some reviewers that his first book have been even more captivating, but this one is also more focused on a given area of research. So you get more depth, and less breadth.<br /><br />The book may not be for everyone, but I still highly recommend it for most people. If you are interested in the topic of lying and cheating, this is an excellent read! If you are interested in behavioral economics or consumer psychology, it is also a very good read! If you find academic articles boring and wish research could be presented in a more reader friendly compelling way, this is an outstanding read! If you are like some reviewers here and don't believe in the value of academic research experiments, then you may not love the book. If you are not sure which category you are in, just get the book and decide for yourself. : )<br /><br />I am obviously a fan of his work, as I even stuck the title of his first book in my recent Psychology Today blog post: [...]<br /><br />That said, even if you are not crazy about the above short article on emotions and investing, I think that for most intellectually curious people, all of Ariely's books are well worth reading. This latest one is no exception!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My son, who is three years old, loved this movie...has to watch it almost every day and request it by saying \\"Despicable Meanie\\"!!
B004LWZW7E|5.0|It's a great concept. What would it be like to live in a world where time IS the money and Money is time? The possibilities are endless. Anyone who has studied finance or read Keynes knows that the relation between money and time is very intimate. This movie takes some time to explore those connections and its impact on human behavior. Personally, I liked the sets and costumes, but more importantly, this movie made me think. In many ways, the world \\"In Time\\" is not that different from \\"reality.\\" If you substituted money for time in this movie, your characters would probably still act the same--selfish, anxiety-ridden, always slightly desperate. Don't expect this movie to be a Summer blockbuster, but if you are looking for an interesting sleeper that is different from the classic non-thinking Hollywood Sci Fi garbage, this might be your movie. Enjoy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The numbers are big enough to easily see. The large keys are easy to use and spaced apart for even large fingers. The colors are nice. All the functions work great.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I hope you realize there is better smut on the internet for free. I don't understand how such a poorly written novel can sell so many books.

0061122416|5.0|This book is a wellspring of wisdom, written as a lovely allegory. Easy to read, but powerful. This book was the motivation my husband and I needed to change our life from mundane to a pursuit of our dearest dreams.

B008S4YZCO|5.0|I have enjoyed the game so far. it is pretty much time based with real money just speeding things up. the graphics look decent and the game runs great on my kindle fire.

B005FISBTO|1.0|Yeah, please read all of the negative reviews and be sure to turn your tv OFF until it has cycled through the Showtime commercial that you cannot forward past, unless you want the whole season to be ruined in a quick 6 second blurb on the commercial.<br /><br />I have been a loyal purchaser of the Dexter discs since Season 1. We don't have cable TV, and so purchase the series we like. In 6 seasons this is the first time I haven't plowed through a season in a matter of days, simply because the whole ending was ruined. I didn't see the commercial until disc 2. Usually I don't watch them, but happened to this time and really wish I hadn't. To say it's a spoiler is a gross understatement.<br /><br />As far as the season itself goes, it is a solid 5 stars. Right out of the gate it is more intense that all of Season 5. Don't get me wrong, I liked Season 5 a lot, but it was a lot slower than previous seasons. This season ramped it up several notches. I was engrossed from the first episode.<br /><br />Wish I could give 5 stars, but sadly, the poor choices of the editing team at Showtime forces me to give a 1 star, in hopes that others will take my advise and either buy the blu-ray  (wish I'd have done that), or to keep the TV off until after the commercial.
6305882592|5.0|From the cover you don't expect it to be a love story, but Harold and Maude are such interesting people who end up complimenting each other perfectly. They're both strange and hilarious in their own ways, and I absolutely loved this movie. It's a weird one, but the fake suicides somehow make you laugh and mix great with the eclectic story.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Excellent FAotD; has good graphics, doesn't crash, great gameplay, plenty of options and no funny permissions.  Grab this one before it goes paid again!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci gets better and better. He is in an upward cycle in contrast to other well known authors that start a declining trend after being declared \\"famous\\". This book has everything: a good story, great characters, realistic without being raw, and leaving you wanting for more. I hope Baldacci gives us more books like this,. I highly recommend it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game..never a spare minute to get bored. Beautiful  graphics and easy to follow  instructions. My husband and I are each playing so it's fun to compete.
B008BDZP3K|2.0|Hot rats is one of my favorite Zappa albums. Especially the wonderful opening track \\"Peaches En Regalia\\" which is as close to a emo-like tune (like the piano part in Layla) that Zappa was likely to get. But the recording has a little bit of everything a Zappa fan could want - Long instrumental tracks like \\"Mister of Green Genes\\" and \\"The Gumbo Variations\\", off the wall lyrical content in \\"Willie The Pimp (written and delivered by Capt Beefheart), and so on. Definitely in the Top 5 of all time Zappa Classics!<br /><br />BUT!!!!! This remaster is a mixed bag of quality. Re-Mastered by Bernie Grundman in 2008, it has one glaring flaw and that's the horrendous butcher job on \\"Peaches\\". It sounds like this was something done by a 1st year student instead of a pro. Ugh! At the start of the song, the opening bars come in nice and sweet but a little subdued, nothing really different, quality wise, from the previous mix I own. But then the main theme kicks in suddenly LOUDER; the transition is ragged and sudden, like he just instantly decided to  up the master volume. I'm serious, this particular track doesn't sound like it was mixed by a professional. It's awful. I'll concede that there's a better clarity in the mix, and it's certainly LOUDER. The drums are indeed more front-and-center, almost center stage, than previously. I hear a few more fills and extras that were a bit muted before, but my god, this sounds like a mistake that slipped through the cracks. I couldn't imagine Frank being happy with it.<br /><br />As to the mixing on the rest of the CD, I haven't even tried to listen after to huge disappointment of \\"Peaches\\". Actually, I played it on my laptop a week later for background music while I was working, and the rest of the CD didn't seem to have the problem that \\"Peaches\\" did but I wasn't really paying attention.<br /><br />I don't recommend this particular 2012 release. If \\"Peaches\\" is a favorite of yours, stay with your current release or purchase an older one.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|I was soo scared to buy this because I saw all the bad reviews from other people who purchased it on here...Now that I have the zoom, I have no idea why they gave bad reviews!! I LOVE THIS!! IT WORKS AMAZING, NO ISSUES AT ALL. It works exactly like it says...it just zooms in 40% so you can stand pretty close to the TV and it reads you just fine. Dont let all those bad reviews fool you...try it for yourself...I'm soooo glad I bought it!! (you could always return it...but i doubt you will need to)
0062206281|4.0|I enjoyed the first two books by Carlos - Angel Game and Shadow in the Wind.  Prisoner of Heaven is just as well written.  I am enjoying the Prisoner, however, I feel I need to go back and reread the other two books, to refresh my memory of some of the character since it the release of the book seemed longer than I expected.  I like the style of writing and the book holds my interest.<br /><br />In addition, I have been very satisfied working with Amazon ordering my books and this is now my prime way to purchase.<br /><br />Karen<br />Highlands Ranch, Colorado

B007XF0X16|4.0|This movie is a product of its age (sort of a graphic novel). I appreciated the earlier movie but it has no bearing on whether this tail stands or falls on its own merit. I still find myself reading not just the Iliad but various histories including Edith Hamilton's \\"Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes.\\" Watching this movie I was taken back to the amphitheater and can see great orators telling new tales of the wrath of the titans.<br /><br />They may have taken a little too much time designing this presentation for 3D and spent a tad too much time on graphics. Yet the story showed through. There is also a good bevy of actors; one might be a bit distracted at first asking \\"now where have I seen that actor before?\\" but once the action starts you will be absorbed.<br /><br />The tail is that people gave up praying to the gods. So the gods are losing their power and their grip on the imprisoned titans.  Some disgruntled siblings and offsprings join the titans in a tad of revenge. Can Perseus the son of Zeus set things right with a little help from his friends?
B005LAIH4A|1.0|I care about the environment as much as anyone, but this movie was nothing but a pulpit where anything human made is inherently bad and how the world is only good if a wild animal is at home squatting on it. For contrast, James Cameron eloquently stated his environmental position in the extra features included with the movie Avatar and is much more realistic about the balance between the wild and human habitation.<br />  I would not recommend this animated movie to anyone.
0307341577|5.0|This is a perfect summer read and Flynn keeps you guessing what the truth is and what really happened that night.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and subsequently multiple times digitally.  Thank you iTunes!  The more I watched it the greater the enjoyment.  Then I did a little reading about the books and time frame in which this story was written.  Simply a wonderful imagination by a gifted writer.  ERB was a favorite of mine with the Don Sturdy series and of course Tarzan but somehow I missed the John Carter stories.  If you're considering a purchase, I'd recommend it.  This is a movie that will capture those who love imagination, chivalry and unique beauty.<br /><br />A great family film too.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B007Y6OZE0|4.0|I liked their last album (RFRG) better but this one's still pretty good.  The Offspring are always best when they're doing straight ahead punk and singing about dysfunction.  Although on this album they sometimes deviate from that there's enough here to recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|its so fun like 24/7 I'm on my kindle fire. its also there's a bunch of versions its awesome. Get it now!
0783219695|5.0|With Neil Armstrong (the first man to walk on the moon as part of the Apollo 11 mission) passing on today, it reminded me of the Apollo program and the great things the U.S. has achieved in its space program, from the Mercury program to the Gemini program to the Apollo program, to the shuttle program, the Mars program, and on and on.  Apollo 13 (1995) is a great cinematic achievement from director Ron Howard.  It really captures the essence of what happened with Apollo 13 in April 1970.  One of the few failed expeditions in the history of the U.S. space program, it reminds one of how dangerous space travel is and how things can go wrong.  Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Kathleen Quinlan, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinese, and Ed Harris star in this movie.  Quinlan was nominated for an Academy Award for her great performance.<br /><br />The musical score by James Horner is great.  The movie also contains popular songs from the time period.<br /><br />All right thinking Americans should salute Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (the other half of the Apollo 11 mission and the second man to walk on the moon) for their bravery and for paving the way to the future of space exploration.  Now the U.S. is exploring Mars with its rover called Curiosity.  One day the U.S. will take the next step when it comes to Mars.<br /><br />Overall, Apollo 13 is an entertaining movie that I highly recommend.  In my opinion, it was the best movie of 1995.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Highly recommend this book.  I saw a story about Reese Witherspoon buying the film rights to this story, and it intrigued me enough to download the book to my Kindle.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The every other chapter narrative switch from husband to wife helped maintain a quick pace, and I found it very tough to put down.  I think Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer, with really solid insights into the dynamics of husband/wife relationships.  Anxious to see how she translates this to the big screen.

0345803485|1.0|This is a terrible piece of literary work. I wish they could refund money on kindle purchases. I honestly TRIED to read it, but found myself skimming it just to get it over with. Save yourself some time and money and pass on this. And if you must read it, get it from a library first...
B008RTE09S|5.0|If anyone should ever doubt the Beatles greatness, this will NOT be the film to change their mind. It is a silly film. In fact, it is a very silly, very amateurish trifle. In fact it is downright bad. So why do I give it five big ones? Because it's The Beatles, of course. The Beatles were cranking it out for only seven years. There's a limited quantity of Beatles' product and that makes every bit of it precious!<br /><br />Nevertheless, the casual viewer will probably be quite bewildered by this goofy curio of psychedelia. It has no script, no plot, and no acting to speak of.  So, if you've never seen it, go in with LOW expectations. First off, understand that this is not a Beatles feature film. It was originally presented as a one-hour Beatles TV special, nothing more. The first viewing is apt to disappoint; but repeat viewing are apt to be rewarded. It is not a &#34;good&#34; film (in fact it is a &#34;bad&#34; film). But it is imaginative and energetic, it has its moments and it's Beatles!<br /><br />For Beatles fans this lavish-attention release of MMT is way more than welcome! For the first time, we'll be able to see it in better than &#34;bootleg&#34; quality, much better! Just to hear the songs in remastered/remixed uncompressed (!) surround sound is reason enough to celebrate. Then there are the many extras and intriguing aspects (extra scenes? Songs &#34;re-edited&#34;?). I can't wait!!<br /><br />Addendum: Having now experienced the blu ray, I like Magical Mystery Tour even more than before. It has a hip quality. It moves fast. The songs, of course, are great; and the accompanying videos are equal to anything M-TV would produce. The greatly improved picture and sound lift the film up a notch or two. Now that it sounds good, even the incidental music contributes. Everything comes off better than before.<br />The Beatle music itself sounds particularly fantastic! It's been noted that the songs sound even better here than they do off the 2009 CD re-masters. I think that's true. And I think there are at least two good reasons: 1) This is what happens when you take your sound directly from the original multi-track source recordings and remix from scratch. 2)This is what you get when you refrain from adding compression in an effort to make the music sound &#34;louder&#34; (so it will sell in today's CD and mp3 markets).<br /><br />I just wish ALL the Beatles' archive of music, films, and concerts were available in an equally superb presentation.think that's true.

0307913147|1.0|I can only recommend this book to people who love references to War Games, Family Ties, and Rush. This is not an engaging or well written story, and only serves to satisfy the reader's nostalgia. Read or listen to a William Gibson or Neil Stephenson book instead.
B005QUQP76|5.0|I loved my G5 mouse but it died and I replaced it with the G500 which turns out to be way to big for my hands and with my fingers sitting farther back on the mouse buttons I have a hard time even selecting things, much less gaming.  This mouse is only about 10 mm smaller than the G500, but has a much better shape for the size of my hands.  The buttons feel great, the mouse looks really cool with it's aluminum frame and lights.  The scroll wheel has a little \\"girth\\" to it and feels...well, right.  The G500 rattled and felt cheap, but this mouse has an extremely high quality feel to it, it's at least up to Porsche standards, if not Lambo.  Let's face it, when the Zombie Apocolypse happens and people are forced to make extremely cool mice by hand, this is what they will look like.  So you can either buy some weenie mouse, a mouse for giant handed people, or this one.  Personally, and for the money this is one awesome piece of tech equipment.  Bravo, Corsair, bravo!<br /><br />EDIT:  I've now had the mouse for a couple of weeks and I love it!  This is truly an awesome mouse.  I'll be looking into other Corsair hardware in the future.
B000SEGCRS|5.0|Great book.  It was a gift from hubby to get me going with my new camera.<br />I wasn't expecting it to be so humorous as well as informative.<br />Very practical and down-to-earth.  So much more help than the instruction<br />book.
B005FJ7DOM|1.0|I LOVE post-apocalyptic movies (I Am Legend, Zombie Land, The Road, Book of Eli,).<br />But I HATE low budget, low talent, and unrealistic movies no matter what genre.<br /><br />Once you have seen the first action scene in this film you have seen them all.<br /><br />After the first character is introduced there is little to no more character development of anyone else.<br /><br />I have no clue how they got gas for their car.<br /><br />I have no clue how they got/made their wooden spikes or any of their other weapons.<br /><br />I have no clue why \\"Mister\\" (stupid name) was always so serious and angry. I think he should have had a run-in with the Joker, \\"Why so serious?\\".<br /><br />I have no clue why \\"Mister\\" always had to find a prostitute in every town they stopped by.<br /><br />I have no clue why \\"Mister\\" had weed on his person (unless that was what he was smoking throughout the movie).<br /><br />I have no clue why they had to dog on Christians so much.<br /><br />I have no clue why they had to use BB guns (Crossman 660 was the first one I recognized) as props.<br /><br />If you have seen Zombie Land or Book of Eli, you have seen this movie but with much better directing and acting.<br /><br />This film would be perfectly at home being shown of the sci-fi channel along with the rest of their low budget thrillers, but does not stand a chance when compared with the above mentioned movies of late.<br /><br />If you must watch it, then I would recommend renting.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I love this book felt like I was watching it in real life.Sparks did an amazing job describing the details to make it so real. Finished it like 3 weeks ago and I still can remember the details extremely clearly. It's AMAZING!!! You have to read it.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I pre-ordered the book. I planned to start reading it the  weekend after it was released. However, at midnight it was delivered to my kindle. I thought I would read a couple chapters before bed... Right! I was up nearly all night  reading! I could not put it down. Philippa Gregory has a style that's unlike anyone else. I loved every second of the book. This was not my favorite of Gregory books. Better than her previous release but not as good as the white queen. It was gripping, interesting look at the well documented king maker. A must read!  The worst part about being a Gregory fan... Is having to wait for new books to be released.  She's a wonderful story teller!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey....For a so-called best seller, this is the worst piece of fiction I've ever read.  It is so unrealistic and boring I can't even get myself to pick up the book and finish the last 20 pages.  When I love a book, I can't put it down, this book is just the opposite.  It is so boring and repetitive I don't even know what to do with this book....give it away, donate it, toss it??  Apparently I need to stay with my non-fiction books.
B007URCTOG|3.0|It was a good movie but nothing like i thought it was gonna be. I thought it was gonna be a great love story but instead i just kept getting upset about how some of the stuff happened. And i didn't like the way it just ended...

034580404X|2.0|Read book 1, and partially book 2. I would wait for the markdown. The characters are absurd, the writing is trite and frankly once you have read the first 20 pages if you haven't figured the whole story you're not trying. Basically, the main characters seem to be repeating the same sequence and lines over and over again, and the \\"innocence\\" of one of them is nothing short of absurd. If she said HF one more time I think I was going to throw my kindle in the trash. Not my favorite. Now to be fair, I am sure the book has sold so much due to the bizarre sex scenes ginned up by the writer, however for me, they just became tiresome.

MOTÖRHEAD IS ONE OF THE TRUE ROCK LEGENDS, most of their music are cool, but believe me...INFERNO is one of the best!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!! WELL DONE, MOTÖRHEAD!!!!
B006RED4GA|4.0|The script and dialogue had a cleverness that keep ones intrigue.  Character development was good and should not be overlooked.  Not a horror-teenfest by any means, but just a semi-creepy story that actually does not have super-cliqued ending that I would not ultimately have guessed.

I read the whole series in just a week and stayed up late because the books are just so interesting. im such a big fan of any mythology and i dont think there is any kind of series like this on this topic. this series is also great because it informes kids about a topic that is learned in school as well giving them a interesting topic. i love all of rick riordans book and am currently reading the red pyramid. i would recomend this book to both kids and adults from all ages.
0439023521|1.0|**this may include spoilers to Battle Royale**<br /><br />Yes, I'm another person defending my love, Battle Royale<br /><br />This book, I just can't find words to express how disappointed it has made me.<br />Hunger Games moves too slow, and not in a good way.<br />Sure, it's good to stretch out important parts to build suspense, but Hunger Games makes it a bore.<br />I'll read this book and 30 minutes later I'll look at my watch and notice they haven't even got into action.<br />Also, the sappy love story. The teens don't even care about it, they care about who's \\"hotter\\", oh please.<br />I've talked to older classmates who love Battle Royale (I'm far too young to read Battle Royale, I'm just a 14-year-old girl) and they talk about how it's so incredible that Shuya will risk his life to save his best friend's (who was killed by the government) crush since she is injured in her leg.<br /><br />In Battle Royale, 42 junior high (9th graders for the US) students are forced to kill each other by the government and I'm ALWAYS excited to see what happens next. The first chapter is a bit slow, explaining the relationships between the students that have grown up together, crushes, whores, nerds & such. But after the first chapter, everything gets serious. The rules of the game, how they get students to run into each other (kindalikeHG??), how a couple tries to survive while one has an injured leg(HG??). There has been talk about releasing battle royale (the film, yes, it's also a film) in theaters multiple times since it's release, but the subject matter has always been considered too extreme. This is the closest thing to a banned film that we have had in the last decade. Collins ripped the plot of a property that had failed to puncture the American mainstream because of its extreme content, and softened it to appeal teens, which is arguably the only audience in America reliably buying books. This is not talent: it is business. Teens are their target.<br /><br />Calling Hunger Games a \\"reinvention\\" is just a nicer way of saying plagiarism, especially since she never even mentioned Battle Royale in her influences at all, which is suspicious. Considering the basic premise and various details are the same, I do not see why people are fighting for Hunger Games with small differences. The author is not completely stupid, she's not going to write the exact same novel translated again, and it's not that hard to twist the circumstances to seem \\"different\\" enough. Takami (the author of Battle Royale) has stated his inspirations and there is noway that Collins wasn't aware of his work with Battle Royale.<br /><br />And yes, if Battle Royale was an American book people would be all over Collins' ass right now screaming plagiarism. But no, since it's not, the defense is, of course, \\"all authors grab their ideas from different sources\\" and that \\"Hunger Games is written soooo much better\\" (which, for the record, is not a fair comparison unless you read Battle Royale in Japanese while being fluent in Japanese)

B001EC3JME|5.0|I have used this flashlight holder everyday on the job for almost a year.  I work in corrections and my duty belt has seen its share of bumps and bruises and this holster has held up perfectly.  I carry a small Brinkmann flashlight (found here, http://www.amazon.com/Brinkmann-809-1025-2-Armor-Polymer-Flashlight/dp/B0046O9MEQ) in this holster and it grips the flashlight securely.

B008L1PYQU|2.0|I was really excited to hear this \\"remixed\\" version, but am terribly disappointed.  I have purchased quite a few 180 Gram reissue's and box sets, and have generally been very pleased with the sound and packaging.<br /><br />This album sounds horrible!  Very brittle, heavy on high mids, and no bottom end.  I don't know what the CD version sounds like, but this was a complete waste of money.  Honestly, I think my original cassette sounds better!<br /><br />Wasn't expecting lots of \\"extras\\" or \\"bonus tracks\\". I was just expecting a kick ass version of one of my favorite albums, so I could crank it up and rock out.  Even the cardboard that the album cover was made with is thin and cheap.<br /><br />The 180 Gram reissue of Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\", also produced by Ezrin, sounds fantastic!  Not sure why this sucks so bad?<br /><br />This was a complete a waste of time.  KISS (or Bob Ezrin)  actually managed to \\"destroy\\" Destroyer.  So sad...

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Moving and sweet; this story is a refreshing deviation from modern romantic novels..  Don't get me wrong- I love the Fifty Shades- esque books also; but this takes the focus and puts it on the actual love in the love story.  And there's something to be said for the heated sexual tension here as well!  This author does a great job with her characters. The Slam Poetry refreshing-I didn't know how I would feel about it buti it added an element to th book that made it more than just an interesting read!
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|This movie was dumb. It kind of reminded me of running man but slower. And the camera made me want to puke. I think they were trying to be artsy but it was more like a three year old running around with a camera. I thought the story could of been better. Something like digging the tracking device out of your arm with a knife and escaping. A rebellion where everyone refuses to kill each other. But this was a sissy flick where no one was brave enough to rebel. The romance was horrible too. I thought she was faking it the whole time but then maybe she wasn't. Maybe she loves him. Maybe that is how I am suppose to think. 'Does she love Pitabread or not?' I was expecting something good but this really missed the mark. More like a 'look how cool I look with blue hair' kind of movie. There was nothing hardcore about this flick. The story did not have enough character development. The camera never pans out so you can see whats going on. Its always a close up of somebody's face. I get motion sickness and this flick really made me want to puke. Anyway kids might like it for the wardrobe, hair, music etc. Nothing really good as story goes. Acting was not professional but I guess they need practice somehow. cheers!

B003VANOFY|5.0|For a long time now, I have settled for 30-40 dollar wired gaming headsets.  They broke after a few months and it was frustrating to have the crappy connection from the wire;  Having a dog walk all around me and needing to get up ever few seconds made me want my next set to be wireless.  I looked for a really long time, and finally settled for this one.  What was even better was my local store had it on sale for 100 bucks, and it was like 50 bucks cheaper than usual.  My sign to buy.<br /><br />I've had my headset for a while now, and it still works great.  When I first bought it I expected it to be disappointing to some degree somewhere, but I can't found it yet.  Why I think its great?<br /><br />-Range is awesome!  I can walk from my office to upstairs to downstairs to my kitchen and even my drive way without losing my conversation with my gaming buddy and know when I'm being eating alive in the game.<br /><br />-It's a bit too smart.  The headset shuts off automatically if you have it in a horizontal position.  So if you are like me, I rip them off my head to save dinner that is burning... you tend to forget to turn it off.<br /><br />- Reads my mind.  I can be listening to my music and then I get a call on skype from my friend, it automatically brings my music down so to the right level so I can hear him in the front and the music in the back.<br /><br />-The head sets are comfortable, I game for hours and I never feel like they hurt my head.  Sometimes I only have one ear on an with the all the adjustment points, the headsets still sit very safely on my head.<br /><br />-The volume adjustment wheel is easy to get to, so I don't have to fumble twenty screens and press the wrong button and blow my ears out.<br /><br />-Mic:  Push up and it will mute the mic for you, and pull it back down and it will turn on.  There is also a button for it if you just want it off for a second without messing with the mic. The flexible mic is nice to adjust if you like it a certain distance or in a certain position.<br /><br />On the whole, I know it isn't the perfect head set, but for the money you put in it you are really getting some quality stuff.  I've dropped this headset a few times and it works great, and not having the cord is awesome.  The charge is quick and holds for a while.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a good headset without spending a lot!n distance or in a certain position.<br /><br />On the whole, I know it isn't the perfect head set, but for the money you put in it you are really getting some quality stuff.

1401235166|5.0|**This review contains spoilers**<br /><br />I found the seventeenth volume of the Fables series to be a fascinating entry to the series. I loved all of the new plot lines that have come up in the trade. The cubs inheriting the North Wind's Kingship was an interesting storyline, as is the prophecy Ozma told little Ambrose. One thing that bothered me was not hearing anything about Ghost regarding the prophecy or the contest for the heir to the North Wind's title. I know he's a secret to everyone but Snow, Bigby, and his siblings but surely THEY would have mentioned him, and how does he feel about all of this? We know what all of his siblings think but not Ghost yet. I'm not naive enough to think that it won't come up later in this storyline BUT it'd be nice to hear him get acknowledged in this Cub-centric arc.<br /><br />The storyline with Bufkin in Oz is also really fun, he and his crew of friends grew on me fast. I was afraid at first that I'd think of Bufkin's adventures as the B-plot but it actually managed to keep my attention just as much as the other stories.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying the parts with Mrs. Spratt shedding her old image (and a lot of weight) and wanting revenge on the Fables she grew to resent is an inspired idea. I cannot say how much I love that new plotline! I always just thought of Mrs. Spratt as being a background character who was only as hateful as she was because she was just a miserable person (or the fact that she was a widow after Ghost accidentally killed her husband) but seeing what she had to go through being one of the few unattractive fable women among plenty of gorgeous ones who are more well known and regarded highly for their beauty in the stories they hail from, yeah, I see why she treated people the way she did in the past. It had to have been rough on her. I was really looking forward to reading more about what she plans to do after the last TPB, but here there was really not much of anything advanced in regards to herstory, just a little bait to keep us all intrigued. It's good but I'd have liked to have learned more.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts in this TPB would have to be Rose Red becoming a paladin of hope. I really loved how Willingham used the stories of The Little Match Girl, the Goose Girl (The False Bride), and Santa Claus. I'm really impressed that he picked such good characters for the agents of hope. I guess I should point out that it does bug me a little that The False Bride made it sound as if in her story that her punishment (being put in a barrel with iron nails in it and then having the barrel rolled down the cobbles, killing her) was done just as a regular punishment... but in the actual story she was asked what punishment was deserving for what she did to the true bride. She said that such a person deserved nothing less than being killed in that manner. So she set HER OWN punishment. I thought if Bill Willingham had her say that part it would have added a greater level to her being the Spirit of Hope for Revenge.<br /><br />Other than that plotline, we get a bit more side stories involving the lustful Porky Pine the porcupine who is horny for human women. I'm pretty sure he showed up in some other arc but it's interesting to see how he gained the unusual fetish he has. Also an interesting side story involving a powerful sorcerer Abra Kadabara who has been the unspoken reason the Adversary's forces hadn't struck in Fabletown (until he is killed by Dorothy in a tie-in to the 2nd Cinderella miniseries). Fascinating stuff! Also there's a pretty fantastic backstory of the turtle with the cup on its shell from the background of the Rose Red trade.<br /><br />Suspense seems to be the theme with this volume. As other reviewers have pointed out Bill Willingham has really been setting many new and interesting twists in the Fables universe. Like a lot of the other reviewers on here, I do also wish that he would give some stories proper resolution before doing so many, but having been a Fables fan since I was 13 (way back when the first trades came out) I can already tell that when he resolves each of these, he's going to make them amaze his readers.<br /><br />The art is fantastic in this trade by the way. As always Mark Buckingham is phenomenal. He just keeps getting better and better, I adore the way he draws his characters and the expressiveness in his drawings has been even more pronounced now. The guest artists do a fantastic job as well. I always love when P. Craig Russell lens his art to a Fables story.<br /><br />All together I'd highly recommend this trade. It's a great continuation of current story arcs and has a lot of crucial suspense building moments that will leave the reader begging for more.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|When I received this item I was so excited to use it underwater. The first time in the pool it worked perfectly. The next day, I went in the pool with it again. I left it under the water for about 30 seconds. When I took it out and dried it off, the phone was frozen! We could not turn it off or on. We had to soak it in rice a few different times to remove the water.  The speaker areas in the case were so cheap, that holes broke through and water leaked in. This case is horrible, and I would not recommend it AT ALL. I already sent the case back. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME! ITS NOT WORTH IT!

It is sleek and thin and with the black finish also maintains a professional appearance. HOWEVER, the one thing that is disappointing and detracts a bit is the elastic band that is what keeps the thing closed when not in use. Wish they didnt have that one cheap feature. They couldnt have worked in a clasp or a magnetic closure? I would've even paid more for such an enhancement. This little elastic band will fray or tear in a few months I am sure. Even if it doesn't..it's kind of cheesy to have basically a rubber band that holds your cover closed. The stand feature works fine.<br /><br />So, for the money, not a bad purchase...assuming the elastic band lasts at least a year or two....we'll see.
B008MEM24S|4.0|The game is fun and entertaining but at a point it does get boring because all it is a take on &quot;Where's My Water&quot; I wish it was a bit mire intresting because it's basically the same thing just with Perry. But is a good app and I recommend getting this app.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|A lot of other people have said this is the best DC animated movie out. These people are absolutly right.<br />The animation is increditable. The story is spot on.<br />The list of talent goes on for days, but if this team comes togther on any future project I would expect great things.<br />I would love for the Red Hood to show up as some kind of cameo in a future movie.
B006O3MU96|1.0|Well all it is an HD version of this game plus you can just get the snowy one on the regular one! :-( Talk about Disappointed!

B00873GRU4|5.0|Read it! If this book can't convince naysayers that some indie authors are every bit as talented, hardworking and professional as legacy published authors, nothing will. Wool is not only well-written and compelling, it is based around a chillingly simple premise. Such works are usually the books that resonate in the minds of readers for decades to come and I am sure Wool will be no different.<br /><br />The characters are complex and multidimensional, the action is gripping, and the theme, thought-provoking. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I can't wait to catch up on the next installment of Juliette's story and revisit the silo world.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|it is a great game with great music and even cooler powerups it is a must get even better than the iphone version
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I blame the trailers for this movie for the lukewarm reviews it is receiving on here.  I too went to this movie expecting it be Liam Neeson fighting wolves, but it was so much more!  It's a meditation on death and the strength of the human will.  Obviously a thought provoking movie isn't for everyone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app its amazing it always works and its super loud so u are for sure to get up I am hard to get up and this alarm clock wakes me up easily I would prefer this app to everyone. it is just perfect. get it.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I've had the watch for 1 week and it has gained between 1 and 2 minutes. That's ok for me.<br /><br />I was not disappointed with the watch size, as some reviewers were. It's about the same size as all the other watches I've had, 37mm as stated in the description. I notice that many watches in the last few years are much larger than this traditional size.<br /><br />Some have stated the semicircular rotor, which winds the mainspring from the movement on your wrist, appears tight. Mine does not. Spins around freely.<br /><br />After taking it off in the evening, one day I did not put it on until late afternoon the following day, and it was still working, and the few hours use was enough to power it thru the following night. Some reviewers who report that the self winding mechanism does not last long if not. I wonder if these folks received and read the instructions, which state that at first use, or after it has run out of power for lack of wearing it, you must activate the power reserve feature by winding the crown 40 turns.<br />UPDATE - a co-worker who is a Seiko fanatic, who has several Seiko automatics an can recite the movement numbers on  all of them including this one says that despite that mine came with instructions to wind the power reserve, that this movement does not have a power reserve. Says will run 30 to 40 hours after wearing for a full day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the mobile version! So glad they came out with it as I rarely use my laptop anymore even if I am at home.
1451626657|5.0|Nobody needs me to say that \\"Catch 22\\" is one of the great novels of the 20th century.  It's incredibly powerful today, and it's hard to imagine the impact it must have had when it was published more than 50 years ago.<br /><br />The book strips away any pretense about the glory, intelligence, or fairness of war. It shows the cynical, base motives of the most human of actions: violence. It highlights the absurdities --- the utter contradictions --- that each of us face every day in our lives.<br /><br />The thing that struck me most about \\"Catch 22\\" on what's probably my fourth reading is that it's so densely packed.  There are entire paragraphs that you need to read again and again because they have a remarkable perspective about the human condition.  But then you struggle to remember them 10 pages later because of the new ideas that Heller has raised.  One technique that Heller has mastered to create this density (for all I know, he invented it) is absurdist statements:  \\"The Texas turned out to be good natured, generous and likeable. In three days, no one could stand him.\\"  There are hundreds of these passages in the book.<br /><br />Heller also uses rare adjectives and adverbs throughout the text, often paired with a more familiar word. Again this adds to the density of the reading, even as you turn to an online dictionary for a definition.<br /><br />The book is also memorably grueseome and sexual, sometimes together. The bomber pilots lead a warped life, and so even their leisure is warped.  They're whoring and cheating as much as possible, usually out in the open because they simply don't live in a just society any more.  As an old, starving Italian woman explains to Yossarian near the end of the book, when he asks her why Military Police destroyed her whorehouse: \\"Catch 22 says they have a right to do anything that we can't stop them from doing.\\"<br /><br />Just when you think you're going to like someone or that the book is going to be fun, Heller slams youwith a wounded or dead pilot or a child prostitute.  It never stops.<br /><br />Basically, you become like Yossarian, the protagonist, in that you want to just scream at the top of your lungs that everyone and everything is crazy, and that we need a new crop of adults to come in and change the situation.  Yet, because it's war and human nature, it will never happen.
034580404X|4.0|I really enjoyed the 50 Shades trilogy. I enjoyed it so much that I got behind on my sleep to stay up at night reading. I liked following the psycological journey of Christian and Ana's total acceptance of him for who he was. Good love story and a few lessons to be learned in caring, giving and taking care of others. There are LOTS of sex scenes and this 48 year old learned a new thing or two! The story line could have moved faster but it's definately worth the read!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game, it is so fun I cant get pass wave 5 when I play as the zombies
B001F12J0C|5.0|I am a Bourne fanatic, and the trilogy is one of the best to me. The Trilogy from beginning to end is perfectly crafted, edited, and fit together thematically with no let down in quality. Thanks to the director and actors for well done products. I can't wait for the parallel new Bourne movies.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a fascenating and exceptional journey of a dream brought to life.  Told through various viewpoints, Morgenstern ensures that you continually see different colors with each added layer in the circus of black and white.  It is impossible not to reach into the depths of imagination with this deliciously engrossing and beautifully written novel.  I have rarely seen an author with the capability to write such distinct and intricate elements that come together so cohesively.  It's quite a wonderful work of art.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|I am a Dark Knight freak, and this is one of the best. The Trilogy from beginning to end is perfectly crafted, edited, and fit together thematically with no let down in quality. Thanks to the director and actors for a well done product.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've never been able to give any app a 5-star rating until this one, because there's always something that needs tweaking or is missing a key feature.  This app is the obe exception; the designers included everything a regular calcular has and then improved on that!  I love the place that shows what you've calculated so far.  The numbers are large and easy to see.  This is an intuitive app with the perfect interface.  Well done!
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I am a Dark Knight freak, and this also is one of the best. The Trilogy from beginning to end is perfectly crafted, edited, and fit together thematically with no let down in quality. Thanks to the director and actors for a well done product.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Lovely food photography, thoroughly enjoyed watching the incredible results of one man's passion in life. Another reviewer remarked that they would like to see more about the struggles Jiro encountered, and I agree. However, I think it only highlights the traditional Japanese culture and how it affected Jiro's personality over the years, as well as his relationship with his sons.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book!Fun to read and very interesting!Nice to see how true love can help peolple try to change for the better in spite of the differences !Lots of passion!One immediately wants to read the following one in the trilogy.
B000021XS0|3.0|I write a technical, but brief review of this album on my blog. The story is very interesting - great \\"concept\\" - at least as interesting as 2112 or Operation Mindcrime.<br /><br />But the music? How can this compare to those other albums?<br /><br />There are some great (and horrible) moments in Scene 4, but really there is too much high-proficiency noodling on this album, and not enough hook, harmonic interest, etc. But that describes Dream Theater in general, so can't fault this record alone.<br /><br />3 stars out of 5.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I used to play this game quite a bit until I actually read what was going on. The game is fun, but the having to be on a network is ridiculous. Rovio, O Rovio, what hast thou done unto thy followers?

B0049GYXDG|5.0|The product arrived extremely quick and the quality was top notch!  I had never seen the Alice in Wonderland cartoon and it was slightly weird at first.  We bought if for our daughter who is almost three.  She was bored at first but now watches it repeatedly.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD. The title track is Hauntingly AMAZING..<br />Just after Mike S. Passed away, I heard this song, and have to admit<br />got a little misty.. Jerry has done an INCREDIBLE job holding the sound<br />of A.I.C. \\"TRUE to the Music\\"..<br />Rest assured.. there is NOT a bad track on this release.. If your an<br />A.I.C. fan.. this is a MUST HAVE !!!
B005LAIHPE|2.0|\\"We're going in... full attack....  That's an order.\\"<br /><br />I was lured into watching this film by the fairly high rating on amazon.com.  It should be noted that as of right now you can't actually rent this movie, which might be an indication as to the \\"enjoyability\\" of the film.  That's just a wild guess born out of suspicion, by the way.  So, buy it I did, and boy what a waste of money it turned out to be.  I didn't not like it, per se, but I didn't like it either; hence the 2 1/2 stars.<br /><br />The move starts off telling us that when scientists discovered an earth like planet in the Gliese system, NASA built the most advanced communication satellite ever so that they could send a message there.  Why NASA would do this, seeing how an earth like planet does not automatically mean life let alone intelligent life, is beyond me.  But, hey, it's just entertainment, right?  Unfortunately, the film is just not entertaining enough to ignore the many flaws.<br /><br />There's a whole comical scene in the beginning, involving a slacker named Alex Hopper who's rooming with Alexander Skarsgard (who's performance is shockingly terrible here).  I use comical in a bad sense here because it is not at all funny.  Alex meets physiotherapist Samantha Shane at a bar/restaurant and tries to talk to her.  To make a long story short, he makes a deal to get 5 minutes of her time, if he gets her a chicken sandwich (the bartender/chef refuses to make one).  Alex breaks into a gas station store and hilarity ensues to the tune of the Pink Panther theme.  Horrible.  Why isn't Alex in jail after breaking into the store or even let into the Navy after that stunt is never explained.  There are other parts of the movie like this where the jokes just fall flat.  Like the incredibly nerdy scientist (what's with Hollywood and nerdy scientists?) who thought the 1-emotion (deadpan) double-amputee black guy, Mick Canales, was a cyborg.  A cyborg, I kid you not.<br /><br />Rihanna was pointless.  It must have been some attempt to create another Vasquez from Aliens, but fails horribly.  They actually gave her the hero's final line.  You know, the yippeekayay moment and it was horrible.  Why is she the only woman on the ship, anyway?  Speaking of ships, the alien ship jumps in and out of water like a grasshopper.  Why?  It's not stated.  I guess just to give us something \\"visually stunning\\" to look at, but it just looked stupid to me.<br /><br />Anyway, the aliens look like ogres with spiky beards.  Real original there, Hollywood (sarcasm).  There's no indication what the aliens want, by the way, except for some psychic bond one has with Alex for no reason whatsoever.  I guess they wanted an Independence Day moment, but fails because instead of Alex telling us what the aliens want based on the flashes, he just says he has a feeling about them.  Well, I guess, since I don't know what they want either based on that jumbled mess.  It looked like the aliens were at war with each other, then came here to destroy our technology and infrastructure for no reason at all.  None of the weapons or aliens ever targeted people, unless threatened.  Get it, like the Borg?  From this psychic link, Alex deduces that they want our planet or themselves.  Why Alex?  Can you elaborate?  No?  Are you at least empathetic enough to save the sailors in the water, without having to be told to?  No?  Okay, moving along.<br /><br />It's possible to deduce that the aliens destroyed their planet, or were destroying it, and sent out a scout party to look for another planet to live on.  Putting aside the logic that an alien race wouldn't send a military unit to do this (you need scientist for this job, Hollywood.  do'h), it still doesn't make any sense.  War destroyed your planet and your solution to this is to start another war with another species on another planet?  Riiight.<br /><br />This brings me to the point of not caring about a single person in this film.  Liam Neeson?  Wasted.Louis Lombardi  (Edgar from 24) and Peter C. MacNicol (Janosz from Ghostbusters and Tom Lennox from 24)?  Wasted.<br /><br />And then there's Cal(sp?) the scientist.  This is like the pinnacle of nerdy scientist ever.  But this is nerdy to the point of mind-numbingly annoying.  This is the guy who makes the cyborg comment I mentioned earlier.  This is a winy little annoying uber dork who runs away from the fight, because he thinks its safe, and takes his suitcase with him.  Do you see what's coming?  I won't spoil it.  It's just too laughably ridiculous.<br /><br />Nice to see a shot of a Buddha statue instead of Jesus in a film, though.  It didn't get destroyed, though.  I guess it's not shocking enough to Hollywood for us to see the symbol of other people's beliefs being annihilated before our very eyes.  But maybe that's over-analyzing.  I'm not Buddhist, by the way.<br /><br />So, to help you decide whether you want to watch or not:<br /><br />1) Characters are pointless and their deaths don't matter to me<br />2) Aliens have no real motive and aren't interesting.  They also never talk.<br />3) Bad comedy<br />4) Boring first half<br />5) Moronic hero<br />6) The \\"S\\" word is used a couple of times, while the \\"M\\" word is half said at least twice)<br />7) Acceptable musical score<br /><br />If you like empty movies like Underworld, Resident Evil and Transformers II & III (the Transformers movies are better than this), then you'll probably enjoy this.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|John Carter got a bad rap from critics and not many people went to see it in theaters, but the ratings from dvd buyers and amazon comments says it all.<br />The movie is much better than you would think, or what dumb critics would say in magazines and tv.

B0018TLRTK|5.0|I had thought Billy Idol was probably overrated before, but hearing this cd, now I'm thinking he's underrated and I will be checking out the rest of his albums.  Maybe it's the mastering on this album that is good? I will have to compare to the re-released albums (some of which I've already been listening too).  A lot of influences are shown in these songs, whether punk, rockabilly, country, techno, Elvis, etc.  While the guitarist Steve Stevens would never be what you would call a great guitarist by any stretch of the imagination, he obviously was important for being a consistent co-writer with Idol and also proving continuity within the band.  Listening to the songs, there also some obvious musical similarities to some of the other 80's acts of the time, all in all a great cd.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|It would help to know a little of Rush's music and some of their history, but it's not essential.  The story of Getty Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neal Peart is one of unshakable determination and extremely uncompromising integrity.  Inspiring anecdotes fill the documentary, like when Neil said that they were going to do their next record [Hemispheres] the way they wanted to even if that meant not reaching a wider audience, losing their record contact and ending up back at their \\"day jobs\\".  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect I found was the very deep and respectful commentary from artists such as Billy Corgan and Trent Reznor (two artists I did't particularly care for - but have a new found respect for).  This documentary was a complete joy to watch from start to finish.  The inevitable discussion of Neal Peart's tragic few years in the late 90's was very sad to watch, but the story of their friendship and how the band came around to continue was amazing.  The restaurant scene at the end was hilarious and pretty much sums up why I think they've been together for 40 years. SEE IT!!<br />I saw this on Showtime, but just ordered it on Blu-ray from Amazon.  I'll edit my review with specifics on the Blu-ray version (which I don't seem to see much discussion on).
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So I bought this book thinking it would be a laugh and to see what all this hype is about... and made the mistake of knowing what the author looks like. Perhaps it was that this book was in first person... perhaps it was the creepy constant mention of her subconsious with the same halfmoon specs as the author or the inner goddess with pom poms but this book felt like I was reading a poorly written fantasy sex journal by and of the author... and it totally is just that. ew. ew ew. text to speech function was hillarious for a little but this book is really just too awful... even that was creepy. Save yourself the waste of money and watch comedians read snips online

0698116496|5.0|This is one of my favorite Peggy Rathmann picture books. Gorilla takes the zoo keeper's keys as she leaves to go home for the day. He lets out all the other animals and they all go to the keeper's house to sleep. Shows zoo animals as a family with the keeper as the dad.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I didn't originally intend to but this app, as I never liked the Tv show and found it VERY mind-numbing. However, this app is not that bad. It has references to the show, but didn't rely on it, and the graphics were good. The game is designed almost exactly like where's my water, but has a few more features: oil, gnomes,  and Hot/Cold/Crazy-inators.<br />So, kind of redundant, but worth the $.99
B005G4TJI4|5.0|great movie stunning on blueray and surround sound!! i would recommend this to anyone looking for a great action movie with great visual effects!
0439023521|5.0|I love it when I snag a book that I know nothing about except that a friend said it was good, and wind up reading it in two sessions. Fortunately, I didn't \\"discover \\" this book before the author had all three of them written. I just finbished \\"Catching Fire\\", also in two readings, and was surprised that the author was able to out do herself. The second book is better than the first, only because the reader is already aware of the personalities of the characters, and the setting. Opening the second book is like meeting old friends. I look forward to the last of the trilogy not only because it closes out the series, but because it did get somewhat mixed reviews. I gather that it didn't end the way a lot of people wanted it to, with good things happening to the good people and the bad guys getting their just deserts. I will probably like the book since I tend to be more of a pessimistic realist.

0439023521|1.0|I just don't understand why this book is so popular.  The writing was terrible, the character development was nonexistant, the story was just stupid, and the purpose of writing such a book escapes me.  I know this book was written for children (although the subject is totally inappropriate for children)<br /><br />Again - I ask why?
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The movie was true to the book. Some smaller details were changed, but many major scenes from the book made it to the screen, which, IMO, is rare for a book to screen adaptation. In this movie she is a survivalist. In the next movie, if it stays true to the book, she becomes a hunter. I look forward to the next movie, and hope that it too stays true to the book.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is ridiculously good. Its fun, and addicting. But the only thing I hope it would improve is make it more responsive. I have to admit, most of the times it was laggy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game this is amazing and I reccommend you get it it has really fun games and great challenges!! great!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|of course this game is wicked fun to play but $2.99? really?! all the other angry birds are 0.99 or free but on amazon u only get hd so I suggest all u kindle fire owners wait until it goes on sale or becomes the deal of the day because it is like a lot of the other angry birds; but otherwise my lil cuz loved it!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like others, I thought this would be too easy. It is addictive and makes you plan a strategy to complete. My kind of game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I enjoy this game myself and my baby cousin (6 now) loves it so much he is constantly playing it. forget the fact it costs 0.99 (ur lucky that's all it costs!) it is worth it and j spent another dollar to unlock all the levels for the fun of it duh!!! so I say this game is a bit pricey but so worth it! I spent $1.98 on it and I really do think its worth it. unlock all the levels it is twice as fun!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I usually worry whenever I hear one of my favorite books is being made into a movie. The same was especially true of the Hunger Games. And yet, they did a great job all things considering. Yes, I will always love the book more because of the depths of emotion you get being inside Katniss' POV but Jennifer Lawrence did a fantastic job showing the emotions of the character in truly horrific situations. And the script stayed true to what was important to the story. Can't wait to see what they do for the 2nd film!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I really loved the story and how much humor was written into the story line. All of the actors did a great job. I would love to see a sequal.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a very fun game with lots of variety and interaction with virtual neighbors. My only complaints are that acorns are hard to come by unless you pay real money and tokens for the mini game is even scarcer. You have no options but random discoveries in snow piles and one token available daily in the mini game. I should mention that this mini game gives you the chance to win acorns, coins or really cool stuff you can only purchase in the store for mucho acorns. All the same, I will keep playing because it's  fun.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|To all the whiners and complainers, I say get a life!  Really, what are you expecting?  If you want to listen to the original, you know where to find it.  This remix on 180g vinyl is a great addition to your LP collection.  For those who love the look, feel, and sound of vinyl this is a great way to relive those old days and get this in your collection if you don't already have it.  And there's nothing like this great album cover with a full size insert of the original with Ezrin's essay on the remix.  Spin it again like in 1976.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This was an excellent book, I am an avid reader and have read many books (well over 100) about exercise and nutrition, and this is possibly the best of them all.  In fact I was sorry I bought it on the kindle and may buy the book itself.  I have found that a long book on the kindle really sucks.  The kindle has no page numbers and so to go back and find something you really liked is extremely hard.  This particular book did not even show an index on the kindle so I could not go to a particular chapter like I can with the bible.  The pictures on my kindle were lousy also, I want to go back and reread several things but it is nearly impossible with the kindle.  If I leave off reading a book like this to go to something else on the kindle it would take at least half an hour or longer to find my place again and continue, the book is excellent but the kindle sucks.

B006964E8S|1.0|This was a disappointing read. It was basically boring and not up to Baldacci's usual standard.<br />The story line was predictable and the characters almost like something out of a jack reacher novel.
B0083IQFD2|5.0|Azealia Banks is crazy talented. If you like the ridiculously fast rap and the sick beat of 212, 1991 and Liquorice won't disappoint you either. I'm not really a fan of Van Vogue, though - it's slow and long.<br /><br />I'd still say it's a must buy, though, for both rap and dance music enthusiasts. This girl is intense.

B001C4AFOY|4.0|This is a fine film that concentrates on--as indicated in the title--the early years of Queen Victoria's reign.  Emily Blunt is lovely as the youthful Victoria. Previously, I had only seen Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada; while Blunt's role in Prada was not a particularly demanding one, I thought she still showed a great deal of promise as an actress. As it turns out, I was not wrong.<br /><br />Blunt is convincing in her portrayal of the youthful Victoria who makes her fair share of mistakes as she attempts to balance the demands of a monarch, but also displays early glimmers of the steely certitude that characterized Victoria's long, historic reign. While it goes without saying that Blunt is considerably easier on the eyes than the good queen, Blunt definitely does not skate by on her looks.  On the contrary, Blunt's Victoria is a multi-dimensioned character that is plagued by her own self-doubt, unscrupulous advisors, as well as the giddiness and naiveté of her youth.<br /><br />Rupert Friend is excellent as the young Prince Albert who is under as much pressure from the house of Saxe-Coburg to marry Queen Victoria as Victoria is to simply marry anyone from the short list of worthy candidates.  The chemistry between Friend and Blunt is interesting and the strong bond that the two forge forms the rock-solid foundation for their future marriage together. Friend is physically suited for the role of Albert and the boyish charm that he brings to the role is as irresistible to the audience as it proves to be for Victoria.<br /><br />The costuming in the movie is simply stunning, as is the light and set direction.  One particular standout scene is an intimate candle-lit moment shared by Victoria and Albert as they play chess together.  Albert coyly, but intelligently, flirts with Victoria who glows in response to the handsome prince's attention; most of the shot is in shadow, except for Victoria and Albert who seem to give off their own illumination--it is sheer magic.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the film. While it is true certain liberties were taken with historic accuracy, I don't think the final outcome is particularly damaging to the overall integrity of the movie. It is a must-see for fans of period movies, the English monarchy, or even those who enjoy a charming love story.

B008E374T0|5.0|Brian Fallon can do no wrong...for the most part. I first heard Gaslight when The '59 Sound came out, I went and bought all of their albums as soon as I heard the song Great Expectations in which I've had nothing but (great expectations) ever since...and I have not been disappointed.  Since then they put out American Slang which is a GREAT album but debatably not quite as good as '59 Sound but still worth listening to over and over. Next came Brian Fallon's side project called The Horrible Crowes...it wasn't love at first listen but slowly each song unraveled and revealed itself and it's soul and the more I sank my teeth into this album the more the two of us became inseparable. And now I've just received Hand Written (Deluxe Edition) and of course the album is incredible and for now I'd place it somewhere between American Slang and '59 Sound only because sometimes like Horrible Crowes my ears need to be acclimated to greatness, but if you want to know if you should purchase this album I think (aside from the \\"Grandma take me home\\" song called Sliver) the answer is obviously yes and if you're a Gaslight/Brian Fallon fan you probably already did.

B008GOAFBQ|3.0|There are alot of negative reviews for this disc which was rumoured to be a double disc event. For a 35th Anniversary reissue, this is not at all worthy of that moniker. It is a disappointing revist to say the least. Bob Ezrin approached KISS about this remix because he wanted to do something for its 35th. But the thing about Ezrin's recording is that so much of it was premixed during the making of it and many of the tracks were recorded \\"wet\\" (meaning that there was no way to EVER alter its effects, etc). So, from the get-go, this project had many limitations, as he notes in the cd booklet. There are differences, however.  For examples, an omitted background vocal from the archived tape of \\"Detroit Rock City\\" makes its debut along with an added effect to the end of the last verse. Also, Ace's stinging feedback intro to \\"King...\\" isn't as prominent. The piano is more upfront in \\"Great Expectations\\" . And there are other such differences throughout. Then there is \\"Sweet Pain\\" with a different solo (I, myself, was hoping that the different solo was going to be an Ace Frehley outtake) and louder harmonized gang vocals folowing the guitar part. Overall, the mix is more present. The piano agumentations on some songs is not as noticable (eg, Detroit...) and in the process it sounds more \\"band\\" like because it sounds more like just the four guys. The opposite approach could have produced a KISS Symphony version . The drum sound (as noticed in the beginning of \\"Shout...\\") is tighter, with less air.<br /><br />With all of the differences, however, this release is \\"nothing new\\" and the lack of fanfare is most distressing. Diehard fans will notice the differences but those who are just coming to the band will not even be able to appreciate them. So, for a 35th Anniversary, this really is targeted at diehards. If this present disc had been accompanied with a second disc of demos and outtakes, then there would hardly have been any negative reviews. The Remix is great for what it is. The packaging is good (although they SHOULD HAVE altered the color of the back to match the front artwork). The black disc even has a faux record label. There is so much that is good about this issue. But the complaints are valid. The bonus track is the original solo to \\"Sweet Pain\\"? THAT doesn't qualify for  an Anniversary acknowledgement. KISS has just rejoined Universal Music Group. They have nearly all of KISS' recorded stuff. There is plenty that they could have included. A live DVD or cd would have been SOMETHING. A stripped bonus disc would have been SOMETHING. A symphony remix as a bonus disc would have been SOMETHING. But what they have issued--great as it may be sonically--is unremarkable in value. I have bought this album in several formats numerous times. I don't regret buying this version, either. BUT all of it was unnecessary. Want to revisit something? How about a remix and remaster of Hot In The Shade? Some of the 80s percussive things on that disc, particularly \\"Read My Body\\" need an exit. How about a guitar-dominant remix of Unmasked? What if you release a version of The Elder with Ace's guitar parts present? There's a lot that could be remixed and remastered in the KISS World. BUT--and it's a big one--do it with determination. I'm not knocking Ezrin's remix. The disapointment is not with this issue's sonics. It's with its packaging, what it does not do because of what it does not include.<br /><br />Bottom line is that completists and die hards will buy it. New fans won't appreciate the differences.

1451627289|1.0|What a horrible book. I am amazed at all the positive reviews on here and elsewhere, sorry guys. I don't want to write about everything that was horrible, so I'll stick to a couple big issues: the beginning and the ending. Although it did a good job of producing some touching moments, the premise on which the book is based lacks any believability. The only thing that kept me reading the book was that I bought it before a 4 1/2 hour plane flight so I was several hundred pages in by the time we landed and I wanted to see if Mr. King really ended it how I thought he would. Here is why I thought the premise was ridiculous. The protagonist is 35, a generation X individual. I'm the same age, so let me tell you there is zero chance a normal gen X person goes back in time, giving up 5 years of his or her life, to stop the Kennedy assassination. One reason for that is that it's an event that has very little personal relevance to most of us because we didn't experience it. It's an immense event to those who lived through it, I completely respect the enormity of it and have empathy for the pain it caused all those affected. However you would have to be some twisted angst-ridden gen X-er who hated the present world in order to want to go back and change everything, and just having one alcoholic cheating ex-wife as a negative life experience does not get you to that point. Sorry. I can't think of one person I have ever met who would ever consider undertaking this ridiculous mission. Seriously, would you do it? I know it's a fantasy story, but character actions within a fantastical setting still have to make sense. As a side note, Mr. King's personal voice came through too loud and clear throughout this first-person narrative and jarred glaringly with the protagonists supposed age and experience. It was obviously the voice of a 65 year old, not a 35 year old.<br /><br />The ending was also painfully obvious and a lonnnnnnnnng time coming. Somehow the protagonist endures several years in the past and never seriously considers that the future outcome of saving Kennedy could be negative, despite the fact that outcomes may not turn out rosy as evidenced by experiences with the shooting victim and the Dunning family. He just seems to blindly go along with the idea propagated by the cancer-ridden diner proprietor that if Kennedy is saved, the world will be a better place. Any normal person in the protagonist's place would seriously consider a negative outcome however. Why didn't King have Jake ponder this issue at length? I believed when reading that it was because he wanted the reader to go along with the premise blindly as well so he or she would miss the parallel that changing the past leads to negative outcomes, and so it would in the Kennedy situation only in a really big way. So not too far in this book it was obvious that there were hundreds of pages of inane fiction that were going to get erased as a result of the protagonist popping up in a post-apocalyptic 2011 and then having to go back for a reset and allow the Kennedy assassination to take place after all. This is equivalent to the dream cliché where a protagonist wakes up from a long sleep and realizes that whole eye-popping adventure they'd had never really happened. 11/22/63 has a ridiculous premise and a cliche and obvious ending.
B008ETOSYI|3.0|I thought this would be like The Notebook or even Dear John but was disappointed when it came to the conflict in this movie. No way would a woman get angry if I guy found her picture and used it as a lucky charm.

B004LROMSO|3.0|I tried watching this series when it first aired, but I never made it past the first episode. Honestly, Jamie Campbell Bower as a young Arthur grated on my nerves and I decided to forego the rest of the season.<br /><br />But when I had the chance to sit down with the DVD and watch the entire season, I admit that I was drawn into the story and found it to not be quite as bad as I anticipated (although that does not mean I would describe it as \\"good\\").<br /><br />The costumes and scenery are outstanding. I love the lavish sets and the gorgeous costumes. The writing...well, the writing comes off as something a young screenwriter might produce. The dialog is often forced and the characters use phrases that I am pretty sure were not in existence before, say, 1990. But Eva Green as Morgan is stunning. Green is beautiful and really manages to pull off the air of evil and vengeance. My eyes were glued to her whenever she was on screen. Joseph Fiennes is probably wasted in the role of Merlin. He chews the scenery and I wondered if he ended up in this role because he owed someone a favor. Jamie Campbell Bower never grew on me as Arthur. He just simply does not have the physical presence to play the king that would unite Camelot. He looks like a spoiled surfer boy who doesn't quite know what he is supposed to do next. I think the most annoying character for me was Tamsin Egerton's Guinevere; the character is woefully poorly written and has little to do either than look forelornly into the distance, rail against Arthur for some slight, or prance around nude. Depending on what you are in the mood for, this might just be the ticket though.<br /><br />Still, I give this season 3 stars because it did pull me in after all, which surprised me. I actually am somewhat disappointed that Starz did not order another season of the series because I would watch just to see what happens with Morgan.<br /><br />I thought I would hate the series and I ended up actually enjoying quite a few episodes. I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy this season but if you get a chance to rent it or borrow it, it is a fun way to spend a lazy, rainy weekend.sodes.

B00351YEVC|4.0|I read the book immediately after seeing the film and still found it hard to put down. The book is written very much through Bruno's eyes, so it is told with all his naivety and innocence about what is going on. In that sense it is like a children's book with adult themes - a little like the Chronicles of Narnia in its way of getting inside a child's mind.<br /><br />The film tidies some of them up, but there are several things that seem too unrealistic to sustain the story fully. Bruno's naivety just seems too unbelievable at times - and would there have been a corner of Auschwitz where you could crawl in or out under the wire? Nevertheless, a great way to tell of the holocaust - through the eyes of an ordinary German child, even though he does sound rather too British at times. He seems unable to stop calling Hitler 'The Fury' and Auschwitz he calls 'Out-With'. Would a nine-year-old really be unable to say those words? Why do they turn into English puns?<br /><br />To my mind the best passage was where Bruno asks Shmuel's forgiveness and gradually works his way to being fully repentant of betraying him and they are reconciled.

0345803485|5.0|I read Fifty with the motive of hating it.  I made it through 90% of the book still telling friends and Co workers that I hated the book and couldn't wait to write a terrible review about the explicit portions of the book I had to skip over, the terrible quality of the writing, and the unrealistic reactions of Anastasia to Christian's indecent proposal.  In the last 10%, I found myself thinking, \\"No, don't end like this!  You love him!\\"  It was then that I realized how well developed the characters are and how invested I became in their fate.  I bought the second book immediately and I am now reading the third all while continually skimping and skimming over the love scenes.  The book is good without them.  Is this a great literary work?  NO!  Was it intended to be?  NO!  Will it leave you laughing, gasping, and openly showing emotion as you read it?  YES!  I was wrong.  James had gained a fan.  Very entertaining read for those of us that read for fun... sometimes.  :  )

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I think that I first found this book from some reddit /r/fantasy book recommendations, and when I checked the Amazon page and saw the horrible cover, I almost didn't check it out. However, since the book had so many good reviews and it was only 3 dollars I bought it, but didn't read it for a couple months. Now however, I'm kind of sad that I didn't read it earlier and that I only paid 3 dollars for this beast of a book. After the introduction, the book immediately grabbed me and there were multiple times where I would just read for hours, unable to put my Kindle down. The flavor of this novel is similar to the books from Patrick Rothfuss and Robin Hobb, but he doesn't copy anything from them other than just being similarly awesome. This novel spans many years, I'd say 10-20, and most of the conflicts and questions are resolved by the end, with the only ones remaining setting up a perfect starting place for the sequel. There aren't too many problems with this book, and the ones that are present could probably be fixed for when Anthony Ryan has his big publisher debut in 2013. These problems are mainly some grammar and spelling mistakes (most of them aren't too glaring), some confusion that stems from the narrative jumping around in time, possible problems with the perspective, and the voice of the character possibly being too aged starting off when he's 11 years old.<br /><br />For the world building, I like it, it's relatively similar to a medieval version of our world, with versions of European, African, Asian, and Middle-Eastern cultures/peoples. However, I think that this world is much more cramped, causing a lot of fighting. This world's magic relies a little on hand-waving, but I definitely like the style of it, where it's very much in the background and then it becomes more involved as the story moves forward, almost similar to A Song of Ice and Fire. I also like how the powers resemble innate gifts, kind of similar to the knacks in the Alvin Maker series. Therole of Religion is also very interesting in this book. The main character and his country's Faith is almost a combination of Atheism and Spiritualism, where they believe God is a Lie, but when you die there is an afterlife where your hard work will be rewarded and the passed ancestors are always watching down on you. The Faith is an interesting idea, but even more intriguing is how the religion is still the cause or excuse of many of the conflicts, where they try to convert the Deniers and teach them that their religion and god is a lie. I really liked this, and I also liked how there are 6 (or 7) different orders in their faith that rule it, with the 6th being the one the main character Vaelin al Sorna is given to at the age of 11. Their order is an advanced military service, where the brothers are violently trained to be a type of Warrior Monk. There is a lot of depth in the parts of the book covering this, and I immensely enjoyed it. I especially liked the psychology of this brotherhood, especially the main group of 5 featured in most of the book. There are some very interesting looks at PTSD and the life of a child turned death-dealing soldier. I also really enjoyed how Vaelin killed without any hesitation, but felt regret at times (but didn't get whiny about it) especially when he knows the person he killed was innocent but he still had to defend himself. It's great too, how every other brother of the sixth order deal with the after-effects of war differently, it's just really realistic and something you don't generally see in Fantasy novels.<br /><br />While the story relies on a few cliched gimmicks, mainly someone in the present orating their life-story for a scribe/historian, the author masterfully uses it to push along the plot. However, there some annoying parts dealing with the perspective. The Scribe/Historian in the present is in first-person, and when it switches to the past it is in third-person, but there are multiple times where the tense is broken and present Vaelin offers some sort of insight as to how he would replay this moment multiple times in the future (or something like that). Also, there are some very interesting but slightly confusing moments where we find out that while the reader learns the truth of everything that happened, what Vaelin's actually orating to the scribe is a lie or an altered version to keep his secrets safe. I liked that, but at the same time it confused me a bit, so I assume that as the reader we are witnessing Vaelin's life story in his mind before he modifies it for the in-world audience. This could also probably explain how in the first part of the book when the main character is around 11 years old, that he seems so adult. That we are actually experiencing all of the events through the filter of the mind of a late-twenties? year old warrior. There are also some instances especially towards the end  of the book where parts of the story are left out to increase the tension and drama for the reader for when we actually learn all of what happened. Again, I really liked these parts, but I was confused at times with how the narrative jumped back and forth. Some of this could be fixed by just including some sort of \\"5 Years Ago\\" or \\"Present Time\\" header so the reader isn't wondering at all when/where the character is (especially if the reader has trouble remembering the odd names of different places). The great thing though, is that by the end of this book we are all caught up, so hopefully in the sequel there won't be a lot of jumping around. The only problem is that it will be very interesting to see how Ryan handles telling his story completely in the present, he won't have the crutch of a character orating the past to jump around to the interesting parts of the story.<br /><br />For the story, this is definitely where the book shined. I loved how all of the characters, while being perfect killing machines, are very flawed beings. They make mistakes, perform thankless acts ofheroism, and are reviled for horrible acts they or their forebears committed. There is a lot we don't know about all of the main characters, and when the characters do let their secrets be known, they were all the more important. There are many coincidences and unbelievable moments in the story, but they are almost always very entertaining, and these can mostly be explained either by Vaelin's gift or people behind the scenes trying to unsuccessfully get rid of him. The characters are very complex, and I enjoyed all of the time I spent with them. The first half of the book or so where Vaelin and his Brothers are being trained and going through the trials are probably the best parts of the book. I love the things that come after, but the pace could be a little jarring at times, I felt like it was rushing to the climax. Still, all of the plot twists and different political and religious schemes are very interesting, even when they all fail miserably. Vaelin al Sorna is really the ultimate badass in this book, and all of the action involving him was incredibly visceral and entertaining. He's almost too powerful and talented, but there are multiple times where he's brought down by extenuating circumstances which increases the drama. I don't want to go too in depth with the story to avoid spoilers, but I will say that I loved all of it. The only thing is that with the ultimate ending, even though it answers a lot of questions, I found it lacking in a little power. With what happens, I think that the author was going for something really emotional, but I felt much more emotion (even a few tears) at other parts of the book, and I for some reason wasn't too sad or upset with the end. Still, I was left wishing that I had the sequel to read immediately, so I could see what happened with all of the other characters in the book and how they will react to seeing Vaelin 5 years later. I strongly hope that being picked up by a publisher doesn't delay his next book. :)<br /><br />Ultimately, I loved this book and I think that Anthony Ryan has found a place in my list of favorite authors. He's also gained a life-time fan in me, and I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone, especially if they're a fan of epic fantasy.

The writer repeats herself to much .It was always jeez! oh fifty, stop biting your lips Ana ect ect. it drove me crazy.I've read a lot of amazing books and i can't understand why this one was such a big deal but, then i thought the reason why is because sex sales.I'm glad i finished the books now i can go and read better ones out there. Much respect to this lady who wrote the book because there's a lot of competition in the writing business i just wish it didn't had to drag so long!

0553801473|4.0|George had what sounded like a great idea:  Divide a story that had run too long in half with some characters in the fourth book and another half in the 5th book.  The Fourth book was one of the hardest to read.  I love this saga and HBO has done a very good job of not rewriting Mr. Martin's work.  The fifth book is uneven but I still give it four stars.  I look forward to seeing how the Game of Thrones plays out.  I think Mr. Martin may end up being our century's Tolkien.
030758836X|1.0|Wow, what a ridiculous ending. I agree with others that it seemed the author did not now how to end the book, so she just stopped writing. Nothing clever about this at all, I felt really hoaxed. A previous reviewer said that those of us who did not like the ending just didn't get it - you know the story goes on without us - well I have news for you, we did get it and feel it was a cheap trick. She implied that we were too unsophicated to understand it - ha, you've been had! I watched the last episode of the Soprano's, which ended it the same manner and was delighed by it because it was true to entire span of the series - this was not in that league.
0752874764|5.0|Excellent audio book.  Was not disappointed and was very much like the movie.  I think Lionel Shriver is an excellent author.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Where to start with this book?  Well for starters can someone tell me what the heck \\"fisting\\" in someone's hair is?  Am I missing something there? I've read this one & the 2nd one so far (no intention of buying the 3rd) and I swear to you that they fist in each other's hair at least a hundred times. This book is just waaaaaaaay to ridiculous...don't waste your money.  I am a self described grammar nazi and I'll tell you now that this book is worse than some of the pre-teen status updates on facebook.  The sentence structures are baffling to the extent that I've re-read them and thought, \\"was this book even edited?\\"<br /><br />That said, it is addicting.  It's completely ridiculous unfathomable book porn and it's hard to put down.  I'm still giving it one star however because it's just too crappy to cost 10 dollars to be sent to an e-reader.

0307730697|5.0|This is the biography of an American hero of the type that most captivates us.  It is the story of promise, fall, redemption, valor, awakening, loyalty and courage in a thoughtfully and beautifully written prose.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The books are great they put you in a different world for the night when you are reading them. They are great and I would tell anyone to read them. Pick up these books and enjoy.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|And by \\"Ages\\" I mean all time as well as people of all ages. I was not familiar with the books and had never even heard of the title until this last spring when news of it was everywhere. I thought \\"hmm...sounds like another movie targeted at tweens/teens like the Twilight movies\\". Boy was I wrong!!! Twilight is not even in the same league as this movie and will fade away over time. What makes this movie so great is the story as well as the great acting. This movie is destined to become a CLASSIC in the mold of Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and other 'totalitarian state\\" movies/books. The story is eerily like where the world actually appears headed...where the elite 1% have 99% of the wealth and everyone else shares the remaining 1% of the wealth. And hence, the depiction of the decadence of the rich and their disdain for \\"the masses\\" really hits home and builds up our emotional \\"involvement\\" in the movie. Clearly, the author was shooting to sensitive us to the dangers of where we are headed. Anyway, the movie plot/story really feeds on this \\"us vs them\\" dynamic and does so brilliantly. What could be worse than the 1% demanding a \\"tribute\\" in the form of taking our children to die in a gory spectacle for their evil pleasure? The acting in this movie is superb by both the veterans and new-comers. The two main protagonists are both very appealing and you really want them to pull through. Donald Sutherland as the \\"king\\" of the 1% plays his role to evil perfection. And Woody....sleeper for best supporting actor? Too many great performance to list here. The cinematography is excellent and the scenes of battle/conflict are grim and realistic. And the feelings of young adults faced with being thrust into such a situation are played well. And lastly, the actress who plays Katniss is so \\"hot\\" that my new LCD TV almost melted. Another actress in this role and the movie would be still be good. But Jennifer puts this movie over the top...perfect casting. I have never been so wrong abouta movie going in relative to the hype and what I expected to see. 11 out of 10!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|I'm ordering now, so not a 5 star yet. I'm an avid reader and pick my books very well, so no problems with not knowing if I'll like it or not. This is mainly a, \\"Can't believe people\\" post. Someone said the ebook was expensive. How so?? It's normally a $15+ book full retail, plus tax. Walmart has them at $12+, plus tax. On here for the kindle version it's $9, the trilogy is $2 higher than what you would pay separate. Also, the trilogy is $3+ cheaper than Walmart and $11+ cheaper than full retail. I just don't get sense used in coming up with complaining that it's a high price. Again as another posted, buy it or not, it's your decision. Btw, GREAT PRICE AMAZON!!
B008E374PO|5.0|Owl City recovers after a snooze fest last cd (All Things Bright...) which had only a handful of memorable songs.  Every song on this cd is good and it feels like Adam Young is progressing musically on this, whereas ATB&B seemed like it was all just B-Sides and unused tracks from Ocean Eyes. Brilliantly beautiful pop tunes that will get stuck in your head as much as Hello Seattle and Fireflies ever did. If you got bored after Ocean Eyes, I'd tell you to give Midsummer Station a listen, you won't regret it.
034580404X|5.0|I LOVED THIS SERIES! I ordered these as a ebook for my kindle, however, when I find a book that I love I want to have a physical copy of it as well. I could not seem to put these books down. I think that I devoured them in about a week (I work & that time was getting in the way of my reading). I don't think that there is really anything else quite like these out there today. It is just so wonderfully distracting from the everyday doldrum life; they are wickedly delicious! Please continue the series. If not, please continue with this style of writing and I am sure that you will have a continuous following of fans. Christian & Anastasia are perfect for each other (opposites attract). I know a lot of people that hate on this series saying 'it's just a smut novel' & to them I say 'what do you think \\"Romance Novels\\" are?'. This is just a more direct approach to romance novels--a little more raunchy. I think the author did a fantastic job. Look forward to seeing (reading) more.<br /><br />Laters, baby!

B001NLKXK2|4.0|I have been pondering in the few days since I read this book how I was going to rate it. This is an amazing story about the decline of a brilliant mind from a dreaded disease. Lisa Genova is another brilliant mind in her field and if there was anyone who had the information needed to write this book it certainly was her. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book. The writing was solid and the characters were realistic enough, but there just seemed to be more medical terms and Harvard appreciation than I thought was necessary to tell this story. The side of a fictional novel that makes you laugh or cry or scream or want to get up and do...anything, just wasn't there.<br /><br />  The subject matter is touchy and a lot of people have had experience with a family member or someone they care about having to deal with Alzheimer's. I am sure that this book will touch them on a fundamental level. It is very well crafted and the information contained in these pages may even be valuable to anyone who is supporting a patient struggling with this most cruel of diseases, but I found that the book came off more like a cross between a novel, a medical journal and a textbook.<br /><br />  After giving this a good deal of thought, I decided 4.5 stars would be in order. This is a touching book that makes you think, but it isn't by far the most attention grabbing book I have ever read either. The story keeps you thinking about the disease long after you read it, but I doubt I will remember much about the actual characters for very long.
0345803485|1.0|The book was cut improperly so many of the pages were missing or unreadable.  Please send a new good copy and we will send this one back.
014118261X|5.0|The best detective fiction is written in America and Raymond Chandler is the master. Chandlers language is brilliant. The character of Phillip Marlow is very gritty, very sexy. There are few detective writers as good Rex Stout comes second and Thorogood in his Bigfoot Littlefoot and West is very good as well. I always enjoy reading Chandler and recomend it.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|I'm a newcomer to Arcade Fire, sure I've heard their songs bouncing around here and there and when I have I've thought *wow, who is that?* but due to my heavy degree of scatter-brainedism, I forget before I can look them up. a friend of mine really introduced this group to me a few weeks ago and I've really been loving the heck out of them ever since. there's a lot of talent here. if you enjoy indie-rock at all, Funeral is a great addition to your repertoire.
0812982622|5.0|Not since reading Wild Swans have I been as deeply affected as I was while reading The Orphan Master's Son by Adam Johnson. The story of Pak Jun Do is a powerful, moving story and opened my eyes to so very much I did not know. I did not know much about North Korea, Kim Jong Il, or really anything that was happening until I got a taste of it in this novel and it's done what every good book strives to do - awakened my curiosity.<br /><br />This is, in a way, a sort of traveling narrative-type of story. Through the course of the book we're introduced to various characters in Pak Jun Do's life - the Orphan Master (his father), the Captain, and so on and so forth. Each person has an impact on him, each one provides a valuable lesson, and each one gives us, the readers, an insight into a different aspect of life in North Korea.<br /><br />This book is talked about. It's received a lot of hype, and that hype is deserved. Don't let it put you off from reading it. It's a thoroughly engrossing story that is not only beautifully written, but also very accessible to readers of all types.
0345803485|1.0|Can't get into a book exclusively about physical/emotional/mental/sexual abuse of a woman.  Period.  So glad I borrowed this book and didn't spend a dime on this overhyped garbage.
0439023491|2.0|I thought the first book was flawed, but excellent.  It was tense, gripping, action packed and brilliantly paced with the many random factors that could influence the outcome of the games.<br /><br />But here, everything just falls apart.  The first problem is Katniss.  To be blunt, she does almost nothing except ponder events going on around her, but always fails to put two and two together and recognize what's really going on.  When she does make a decision that might effect something, it's always the most simplistic and effortless choice on how to react.  It was practically comical how every attempt she made to satisfy the president always backfired, and in the end she sort of fell into a revolutionary mindset almost by accident, only to abandon it later and resort to the most simplistic thing she can think of:  protecting Peeta.  She's always unwilling to take risks or take into account the larger picture of what's going on in the world.<br /><br />Furthermore, she's way too overly emotional.  What is one to think of her throwing a hissy fit because her mother doesn't provide what she feels is the proper amount of care to a wounded friend?  Um hello!  Your mother is the professional on this issue, Kat!  Not you.  Trust her judgement for once!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Worst of all is when she learns Peeta has been captured by the Capitol forces.  How does she react?  Does she<br /><br />A.  Immediately get to work on a bold rescue plan<br />B.  Decide that a rescue attempt is took risky and focus on winning the revolution instead<br />C.  Throw a pre-adolescent tempter tantrum and violently assault her friends who just recently saved her life.<br /><br />Sure enough, it's C.  What a hero<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />In the first book, Katniss was a resourceful outdoorswoman and survivalist who took everything in stride and didn't let the most horrific events keep her down.  But here, she's reduced to whiney spoiled brat who is completely unable to cope with tragedy or personal loss, and unable to consider anything beyond the survival of people she cares about.  This is particularly infuriating since it makes no sense.  Her participation in the first Hunger games should have hardened her to the realities of the world.<br /><br />Second of all, pretty much all the significant events in the book happen off camera or outside of Katniss' control.  I never got the feeling she had any major role in anything that was going on in the world around here, which made the first person narration style a lot more frustrating.  Why should I read the story from someone who is learning about the most significant events from second-hand information?  I'd rather here it from someone who was really there.<br /><br />That's not to say this was all bad.  The arena for the games in this book was pretty creative.  Almost as though it was a character itself.  I kind of wish it was the setting for the first book.  Also, I was so glad we got to see a recap detailing how Haymitch won the Hunger games 25 years ago.  Considering his condition in the modern setting, that was quite a mystery.  And the recap was really good too.  In fact, it was way more exciting then events going on here.  I think this book would have been better if it was a prequel detailing Haymitch and his adventures in a 50th Hunger games.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a major downgrade from The Hunger Games, in pretty much every way possible.  I'll still read Mockingjay, just because I want to know how the story ends.  But after this book, I have little hope for quality in the next one.e to cope with tragedy or personal loss, and unable to consider anything beyond the survival of people she cares about.

B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This is one of my favorite series. It shows life during the great depression and the prohibition. Very interesting and lots of action too. I am waiting for the second season to come out.
159562015X|4.0|This book is good at identifying and defining an individuals areas of strength and can be quite powerful, especially when paired with the \\"Strengths-Based Leadership\\" book for managers. However, to be fully useful, everyone needs to take the test.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I am an avid reader and very picky when it comes to certain genres. This book incorporated everything that I love in a book. It has supernatural, historical, whimsy, and so much more. I am one that would say that I hate a book with no problems but this is not one of them. It was well written and worth reading.
0380725398|5.0|Jamaica Inn is a great book that is full of surprizes and twists and turns. Very suspenseful and a classic. Mary Yellan is a fantastic character full of adventure, you will feel adventurous yourself. A great book that kept me up late at night and deprived me of sleep, but this book is totally worth it.<br /><br />This is the second Daphne DuMaurier book I have read. It is only my least favorite of the two because the other book was Rebecca, my favorite book of all time. Daphne DuMaurier is my favorite author.<br /><br />P.S. I am a freshman in highschool. My mom got me to read Rebecca and I loved it so much that had to read another, Jamaica Inn was a great book and I recomend it to all women ages 14+, a man wouldn't understand.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I must have spent four weeks looking at backpacks (online and stores).  The Thule was realized in week 4 and its abilities blew the others out of the water!  I am a long distance commuter by car, and I needed a pack that could hold all my belongings and not break my back.  The top features of this pack are: the exterior pocket that holds valuables from crushing, the bottle water holders, open area with cinch straps that you can easily place items in quickly, and the organization features of three three main areas.<br /><br />This is a great pack for people who have more than the average person on the daily.  Once filled, the shoulder straps are adjusted perfectly for weight distribution.<br /><br />I am a fit female (I say this for the purpose intended- women need to know this pack is comfortable) who enjoys the ease of organization,and not being caught without something I could very well need.
B000VHMF0A|1.0|im tired of the praise of this album. lets face it, it's not his best material by any stretch. it is simply his most popular songs as determined by a largely white audience with a short attention span and who knows nothing of quality reggae. all of these selections are over-produced,candy-coated excuses for reggae. 'white bread raggae' is what i like to refer to it as. the real reggae fan will have to look at 'the anthology' album instead. don't be scared if you don't recognize any of the song titles - 'the anthology' is the real thing. no real production value to speak of, not even of the highest quality sound. but the music!  simply put, people who enjoy the sound and soul of what reggae can be, get 'the anthology'. if you are under the impression that ub40 or anything like those clowns is quality, stick to 'legend'. or if you are some pathetic frat boy who listens to a few reggae songs mixed in with nickelback and journey while trying to explain to some poor girl how deep and worldly you are, then get 'legend'. just play it loud enough to drown out the noise of people laughing at you.

B005LAIGL4|4.0|Mid to late August has perennially been a weak time for new theatrical releases. When I was growing up, it was always the dumping grounds for expected hits that studios shuffled away in full acknowledgment that they weren't the films they were supposed to be (hello, \\"Superman IV: The Quest For Peace\\"). These days, some minor hits have popped up in the waning days of August, and this year has produced another sleeper: screenwriter David Koepp's exciting PREMIUM RUSH.<br /><br />A tidy, edge-of-your-seat thriller that recalls Kevin Bacon's `80s misfire \\"Quicksilver\\" in premise only, \\"Premium Rush\\" likewise follows a NYC bike messenger - here superbly portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - who's been charged with delivering a parcel to Chinatown...one that NYPD cop Michael Shannon is highly interested in. Trying to stay one step ahead of his pursuer, Gordon-Levitt darts in and out of midtown traffic, trying to figure out what he's carrying and help out a college acquaintance - a young Chinese woman - whose life seems to be riding on the outcome of his delivery.<br /><br />I've long criticized some of Koepp's scripts for high profile summer movies (particularly his efforts for Steven Spielberg, including the underwhelming \\"War of the Worlds\\" and\\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\"), but \\"Premium Rush\\" - written with John Kamps - ranks as one of his tightest, and most satisfying, screenplays, managing to mix a fast-moving action film with a twisty, compelling story that packs more of an emotional punch than anticipated. The authentic locations add immeasurably to the film's many scenes of Gordon-Levitt and his fellow bikers being an inch or two away from certain disaster, maneuvering through a maze-like succession of traffic, pedestrians and lousy Big Apple drivers; Koepp the director, meanwhile, deftly mixes in flashbacks to tell a story that works just perfectly in the short, 90-minute time frame employed here.<br /><br />\\"Premium Rush\\" didn't make much noise in theaters thispast weekend, and seemed to fly under the radar completely in terms of most viewers' pre-release awareness (I hadn't even heard of the film until it opened Friday). That's unfortunate, because it's the complete opposite of the bloated, overlong $200 million typical blockbuster most studios are interested in these days. If you're looking for a short but sweet, fresh Hollywood movie, \\"Premium Rush\\" puts a splendid cap on the (surprisingly good) summer movie season of 2012.
B00004XPPK|5.0|10 out of 10... What A Woman! She is indeed the \\" Love Goddess \\" Rita Hayworth maintained her allure and sensual personality down the years since she made this movie. This is why she can captivate audience long after her death. I was not even born when Margarita made this movie but since I googled her biography I became more inquisitive as to what she really is and she surpassed my expectation. A classic in the mould of \\" Casablanca \\". This however is more sensual, inviting and alluring without physically showing anything.  She is something especial. A woman who is naturally gifted and made full use of that talent. Feline movement is just wonderful to see.  Her electrifying personality can only be magnified on the screen.  Original story exceptionally acted by everyone......No one in hollywood today deserve to stand next to her..... I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see some out of the ordinary.....the secret is to listen carefully to what is being said !!!

I was never good at science, but this book was written where even the \\"science-y\\" stuff was interesting and simple to follow.  I had been eating paleo but never really understood the reasoning behind it, and this book helped to explain everything.  Seriously, any question I could possibly have had was answered.  Now I can explain to others why I eat the way I do. :) Thank you so much!
1936608898|5.0|I would and have recommended this book to everyone walking through my life.  This book is by far the best book that I have read in a very long time.  If you are looking for a good understanding of how to eat in order to have the best quality of life physically possible here on this earth,  this is it.  I have read numerous health and nutrition books many of which have been Paleo based and this is by far the most comprehensive and easily understood.  I will be sharing this with everyone.

It is not, however, a happy or even an especially hopeful book; this is a book about the bad things that happen to good people, exploring both interpersonal conflict and the bigger social and political issues that influence it.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|I am kind of a watch nut.  Not a huge collector but just an enthuiast.  SEIKO is my favorite brand.  This watch is great if you like the classic divers.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-PRICE, for $200 you are getting a high quality piece.<br />-TOUGH, this thing is burley and is going to take a beating or anything you put it through<br />-ACCURATE, In three weeks after setting to the atomic clock, it has only lost less than 1 second.<br />-CHRONO, is a good feature and useful<br />-SOLAR, no battery changes!<br />-BEZEL, good bezel action<br /><br />CONS:<br />There are only a few, but I want to mention them.<br />-20mm band width.  The band is OK, not the best.  And your aftermarket options are a little limited at 20mm.  It is a little small and lots of people agree it should be 22mm, more fitting to the size of the watch.<br />-CHRONO is only 1 hour max timer.  I would rather get rid of the 24 hr dial and have an hour counter for the chrono in it's place.<br /><br />That's it, small complaints, but overall this is a GREAT watch.  I also have the SEIKO 'Spork' model, which is a little dressier and an automatic, but this watch is pretty much equal and more accurate and probably more dependable in hard-use situations.<br /><br />Buy one, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Oh, I put mine on a 22mm Zulu strap.  Even though it needs a 20mm, you can cram a 22mm on the watch and it works fine.

As a first-time stay at home mom and first time entrepreneur, I struggled for months to find a way to happily manage my house, my family and myself without driving everyone crazy. I was discouraged and almost defeated when I found this book (through Amazon reviews - what a blessing!). I have been following the FlyLady method for about two months and for the first time in my life I am actually having fun cleaning and managing my home. Surprise is... my husband is using it too :)

B008GHJ6AY|5.0|I have not been as impressed with a band as I am with Riverside in over 12 years when I discovered Porcupine Tree.<br />Now Riverside has edged out Porcupine Tree as my favorite contemporary band.<br /><br />A phenomenal band. Exceptionally well crafted music, flawlessly performed, outstanding vocals and harmonies, and very deep lyrics revealing the pain of mental illness (as heard in the trilogy Out of Myself; Second Life Syndrome, and Rapid Eye Movement).<br />Simply incredible. Cannot wait for their new music to be released.<br /><br />Their vinyl releases are worth finding as they are very high quality with great dynamics.<br /><br />With a new LP coming in early 2013 and a possible tour of the US and Europe, their fan base is about to explode in numbers.

B005LAIGP0|5.0|It's one of those movies that you have to watch alone. Daniel Radcliffe had great acting as usual and the movie just felt realistic compared to other horror movies that just have blood/over-acting/screams and stuff. This movie doesn't have any nasty scene or any like disgusting scene. It's a clean horror haunted house movie and I had alot of fun watching it. Bluray quality of this is great too, also if you liked insidious then you'll love this.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I've spent hours upon hours playing the original CrossMe and am really excited to see this as the free app of the day. Beautiful graphics and the controls are much more intuitive than other nonograms I've played. I would even say it's worth the $4.95 asking price!
B00846REIS|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and can't wait until October for the follow-up! It was a great escape from reality after a busy day. Highly recommend it for those who finish Fifty Shades and are having withdrawals. :) Rated it 4 stars only because the similarities between this story and Fifty Shades were very obvious, as in this book was definitely modeled after it. Fun to read nonetheless and absolutely worth checking out! :)

B007OTZ654|5.0|I have several versions of this album (including a vinyl version which I bought in 1974 - worn out by a clunky old Dansette!).  To be thruthful, I have enjoyed the sound of them all, not having a particular favourite version - until now.  The music for me says it all, and for this album I haven't much cared for critiques of sound quality - I simply get immersed in the music every time I hear this album.  Not this time, the mix done in this remastering is absolutely wonderful, so much so that if Amazon ever offered the facility for a sixth star, this version would most surely warrant it.  Fantastic.<br /><br />If you've got an earlier version of this album and value good sound, then do yourself a favour and buy this.  If you're new to Bowie and wondering what all the fuss is about Ziggy Stardust, then click that Add To Cart button now.

B00007FOMP|5.0|This record came out when I was in high school, and I remember buying it with babysitting money.  I was a caucasion girl living in a mostly caucasion neighborhood, with 4 siblings that simply LOVED all things Motown.  The Supremes reigned supreme with my oldest sister, and all of us had a fondness for The Temptations.  We had a split level home with steps that entered into our living room, and the stairway had floor to ceiling mirrors.  (Supposedly a trick to make the room appear larger.) Anyway, we would push the furniture out of the way, line up, all five of us facing the mirror in dance position, and turn on The Temptations.  We would sing and dance in unison, just like the Temptations did.  Yes, for those few minutes we WERE The Temptations!  My point is, these folks spoke to me and my siblings!  Of course, not like Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On.\\"<br /><br />Marvin Gaye is the GREATEST singer that ever lived and it is evident on this album.  Motown employed some of the best musicians on the planet to work in their studios and with their artists and their releases were well played.  Top it off with some of the best production people and you have Motown's recipe for the success they earned and deserved over the years.  This album was released at a difficult time for our country.  People were uneasy with war, riots, poverty, and a loss of innocence  with assassinations of one president, one civil rights leader, and a presidential candidate. Motown's artists appealed to people of all races and they really didn't want to risk that by delving into anything perceived as political.  Marvin Gaye took them, and us, to a place we didn't really want to go.  Oh, boy, I was ready to go!  I have had this record in my collection since its release. I've worn out two LP's, broken one cassette, scratched one old CD and now own the Deluxe Remastered Version.  It still stands up today as one of the best albums ever made by anyone, and for me it will always remain one of my top tenof all time.<br /><br />Everyone should have this record in their collection.  It is as close to perfect as music gets with great, great, vocals, Mr. Gaye's as well as the backing vocalists, extraordinary backing musicians, exquisite production, and lyrics that are relevant and thought provoking.  It was like Mr. Gaye was tapping you gently on the shoulder and saying, hey, think about this for a minute will you?  Oh, and it contains one of the greatest bass lines ever recorded on the song \\"Inner City Blues.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this groundbreaking CD to everyone that has even a remote interest in music.  If you only own one CD, make it this one.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|After trying out most of the Jetpack Joyride clones available on the Android platform and being let down by overly simplistic gameplay and horrible graphics/lack of animation, it's good to finally have the real thing.  And even better: it's free.  Yes, you can purchase in-game gold to buy upgrades and new costumes/jetpacks, but there's nothing pushing you to do so at any point while playing.  The game can be enjoyed fully without paying a cent.<br /><br />Everything is here: all the things the clones seemed to ignore.  You've got the great character animation and background arts.  You've got an interesting series of gadget upgrades.  And you've got multiple vehicles that could be their own game in their own right (and in the case of Gravity Suit/Gravity Guy, it is).  Then there's the biggest thing every clone on Android was mission: a reason to play in the form of missions that grant you stars that let you level up.  Reach the highest level and the game doesn't end.  You get a badge for your achievement and can start back at the beginning to with your purchased upgrades and gadgets to earn more gold.<br /><br />Easily one of the best games on the Android already.  It should be on every phone right next to Doodle Jump, Monster Shooter, Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and Canabalt.

B007N0REX6|1.0|Post G N'R fame/appreciation is very ironic to me. When I grew up, G N' R was a nice blend of Hanoi Rocks, George Thorogood(I'm serious), and Punk influences. One of the many things that set them apart were their solos, which weren't overly indulgent like Poison, Bon Jovi or the other egotistical \\"Guitar Heroes\\" that dominated mainstream media. Now, years later Slash is hailed as a Guitar Hero and is splashed all over magazine covers, Guitar Center ads, and television. His current status with all the signature gear is eerily similar to the aforementioned detested bands.<br /><br />Sig. gear?! You can buy an old school JCM800 amp for a fraction of the cost. Or track down the rare Jubilee heads. The Duncan JB pickups in that over-hyped AFD guitar can be had for $160; throw them in an LP Standard and there ya go! same thing. Schooled players know that Appetite was recorded with a one-off custom made LP COPY. Stuff it, Gibson. ;)<br /><br />What makes this record bad? Current live performances feature 5 minute guitar solos! Very self-indulgent. This group feels like some hired guns covering some G N' R tracks! Sure, Slash can still play but these riffs seem very Metal and self-indulgent. I like that he's in a group without drama and tip my hat to his success, but Myles Kennedy doesn't seem to compliment him well. G N' R was successful because as a unit, they worked well. Apart, the results are so varied. Duff has remained down to earth, but a front man? His vocals aren't up to par. Same with this LP. The music, here and there has some highlights, but seems so disjointed as whole.<br /><br />How many fans like this independently of Guns? Does this record stand up on its own minus Slash's previous band? These are honest questions to ask.<br /><br />Have fun being post Guns lap dogs.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think it is a wonderful game. It has unlockables that are reasonable so you can beat the game on your own and not have to buy gold, and it can be played by all ages.
B005WGBOZM|4.0|****Contains Spoilers****<br /><br />After last season's finale, The Walking Dead had a lot to live up to for a season opener. Looking at last season (Season One) as a whole, it was a tightly packed six-episode season that never allowed us to catch our breath. It was jam-packed full of plot and character points that kept us wanting more every second and was the absolute best for any adrenaline junkie into scifi or horror.<br /><br />This episode slows things down considerably. There is time to breathe between scenes. Yes, there are still zombies coming after our band of survivors, but the tension is more drawn out, and things seem less dire and desperate. Our survivors have time to react to the zombies, plan their next move, and regroup. The deadlines/timelines in this episode do not seem as critical as they did in the Season One episodes.<br /><br />There is a scene where Carol Peletier's daughter Sophia gets lost in the woods overnight as zombies have chased her. Rick Grimes came to her aid and attempts to draw them off, but then Sophia disappears. Quite a bit of time is spent tracking her down (it turns out that Darryl is an excellent tracker).<br /><br />Meanwhile, Andrea overhears Lori Grimes talking to Shane Walsh, who is saying he is leaving the group. Andrea puts two and two together and realizes the two of them have been having an affair. She doesn't say anything to the group but does approach Shane and offer to leave the group with him as she doesn't feel like she belongs in the group, either. Andrea has been feeling suicidal since her sister Amy was killed and turned into a zombie. Andrea shot Amy in the head herself to keep her from being a menace to anyone else. Shane doesn't appear receptive to Andrea's offer but gives her no answer either way, so it is open-ended.<br /><br />Overall, the episode feels longer than the episodes from season one due to a lot of added filler scenes: There is the scene in the church where they are killing zombies, and the scene on the interstate where they run into the zombie mob. There is the long breakdown on the freeway where they are stranded and have to get their vehicle running again and have to find Sophia. There is a lengthy prayer by Carol in the church that feels drawn out and made me yawn. Even Rick Grimes prays in the church in one extended scene. Somehow, throughout all of this, the episode just doesn't have the same fast-paced flow that the season one episodes did. All of these seem like filler plot devices by the writers to extend the episode. We had none of that during Season One. Therefore, I am disappointed.<br /><br />I am still a fan of the series and will continue to watch it. For me it was a lag in the action throughout this episode and in the timing in several key plot points of this episode. I perceive it as a lag when writers feel they have a safety net (i.e., they did not know that Season One would be renewed: now they have Season Two and this time they have 13 episodes to write and fill). Newsflash: writers, don't write like you have a safety net. Write like this is your characters' last episode ever, and like you as the writers have to tell your characters' stories NOW. Today. Especially with a story like this, about a zombie apocalypse. Because today is the only thing that really counts in their world.<br /><br />At the end of this episode, we get a huge moment ... which I suppose is supposed to make up for all of the filler we sat through throughout this episode. Rick Grimes' son Carl is shot as he approaches a deer in the woods. The episode is left as a cliff hanger, with Carl lying on the forest floor, and Carol's daughter Sophia is still missing.<br /><br />Writers, please don't make us sit through all that filler to get to a huge moment at the end. Stay true to these characters or you will end up ruining this great series. I *still* liked this episode, but it did feel like I had to suspend belief about how my favorite characters would act throughout this episode. Several times they seemed to stay in one place longer than I thought they would, ruminating about what their next move would be, instead of the quick thinking and action that was so characteristic of Season One.

B008D28HYS|5.0|UPDATE 11/26/12 Version 1.7.0.1<br />I've had this app for several months now & had gotten about 75% of the puzzles completed up to the Shogun level. The latest upgrade added almost twice as many puzzles on five of the levels so now I have a lot more to look forward to completing. Also, it looks like the dev listened to many of the concerns the reviewers had & changed it accordingly. With the new update its much easier to zoom & now the numbers pop up as needed when you zoom in/move away from the sides. This fixes the previous issue it had before where you had to scroll back & forth to see the numbers so now you can concentrate on a small area without having to zoom back out. This should also make it easier for those with smaller screens (I'm using a Coby Kyros MID 7042 tablet with a 7\\" screen so I can only vouch for ease of use on this device.) Scoreloop is also gone & the only permission now seems to be 'open network sockets', which is used to link to get the original Cross Me or to rate the app. I got a popup asking to rate it only once so far when I started the app up after updating. There are no other popups or nag screens I've come across. With these changes I would have given the app an extra star if I hadn't already rated it 5 stars. I'm now looking at buying the original Cross Me since I like this one so much. Thanks Mobile Dynamix!<br /><br />---------------------------Original Review (unchanged)------------------------<br />I like puzzle type games and this one definitely got my attention. Lovely Japanese style graphics showcase challenging nonogram puzzles with an original twist using color. I spent hours playing with this app after I downloaded it, caught up in completing the pictures. I guess you can explain it as painting with logic. This app definitely has a permenant place on my tablet. For that alone, I am giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />As much as I love this app there are a couple of issues that need to be adressed. Zooming can be a bit tricky, butplaying is workable on the higher levels using a tablet (I can imagine it would be a nightmare on a phone with a small screen.) Scrolling back & forth/up & down to see the numbers can also be a bit of a pain on the more difficult puzzles. I understand the nature of the puzzle makes a workaround this difficult but I'm sure there's a solution to the problem? I understand why the account permissions are needed for synchronizing different devices, but is using Scoreloop to share scores really needed? That is one feature I will never use. Issues aside, this is a great app and I want to say thank you for making it a FAOTD. If they get the zooming issue fixed to make the higher levels easier to see then I dare say its worth the purchase price.

B007N85ZXY|4.0|This is an interesting take on songs from Americana done \\"Crazy Horse\\" style.  Some work better than others, but interesting none the less.
0007477325|4.0|There is a dark subtext to this well-written entertaining book. Had this subtext been acknowledged up front and pressed into action, I believe this book and its numerous real life experiments could have been a \\"teachable moment.\\" However, I find it rather incredible that this pregnant subtext was apparently overlooked altogether?<br /><br />The subtext is this: Once there was a time in the U.S. when there was something loosely referred to as a \\"culture of honesty.\\" It was not just an abstraction in the back of our collective imagination, but was what made up one of the unacknowledged pillars of our morality, a protective moral layers for our culture, as it were. It, and not the de facto Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMROC), introduced here, was THE moral cultural \\"given.\\" It was the moral code we all lived by. For no particular reason this protective film was everywhere, a cultural leitmotif that was one of the important byproducts of our mostly Christian upbringing. It was not (and was not seen as) an \\"add-on\\" or as an afterthought to the SMORC. It was the antidote to it - the cultural answer to the SMORC!<br /><br />We all knew that the SMORC existed, that it was the temptation \\"out there,\\" waiting to be plucked like the low hanging apple on the tree in the Garden of Eden. However, then (as opposed to now) being honest, resisting temptation, maintaining ones self-respect was the norm and not the SMORC. Being honest rather than -- \\"playing the angles, finding more moral wiggle room, sliding through the moral crevices, dancing on the pinhead full of moral angels, triangulating, compromising with evil, gaming or rigging the system in our favor, running a short or long con, and getting paid by any means necessary -- was the rule and not the exception. Unlike now, being privately honest was what was wired into our nervous systems.<br /><br />The price for making (and accepting) a rational calculation against the chances of being caught doing something wrong (i.e., apact with our inner devil) was infinitely costly, psychologically, socially and morally. Certainly there were many who took the chance anyway. But it is not an exaggeration to say that then the norm was that we were first morally accountable to ourselves and then afterwards to society. This embedded moral cultural strategy changed the moral calculus in favor of honesty for the entire culture in ways that we can no longer even account for. But something has changed, and rather drastically.<br /><br />I can remember when I first learned the lesson that this was the irreducible component of our moral cultural code. It was through a High School friend. Kenneth Caudle (Keno). We grew up in an academically very competitive segregated High School in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. At the end of our Junior year, fearing that Physics (under Mr. Bankston) might trip us up in the coming year, we concocted a scheme to order the Physics textbook from the publishers over the summer, and thereby get a jump on the competition, while at the same time allaying our fears about Physics. This devious plan worked out better than we had anticipated, as the publishers not only sent the textbooks, but also a teacher's guide with all of the problems in the text worked out in detail!<br /><br />I was ecstatic but Keno, my friend was not. Late one weekend night as I had finished escorting a date home on Keno's side of town, I saw a light on in his bedroom. I knocked on the door to see why he would be up so late on the weekend during the summer. Was I ever surprised to see that he was busy toiling over Physics problems? Naively I said, why are you worrying about Physics when we already have all the problems worked out for us? Then came the moral bolt of lightening from my friend that came as a revelation to me at the time, one that since that night I have never forgotten. He said: \\"You don't get it do you? We can't look at those answers before solving the problems ourselves because then we would only bestealing from ourselves?\\"<br /><br />The rest of the way home I had time to think about my friend's very sober message. He was right. By ordering the textbooks, we had only set a moral trap for ourselves: If we looked at the answers, we would only be cheating ourselves. We would not be learning Physics, but we would be learning how to cheat.<br /><br />As a result, we redoubled our efforts to work the problems without looking at the answers, even collaborating on the most difficult problems over the telephone, but never looking at the answers prior to exhausting all efforts to solve those problems. At least that was true in Keno's case. I will now confess that on a few occasions I did look at the answers. And I guess that is why Keno ended up being a Physicist and me a Political Scientist. The guy we were competing against, Clifton Roaf is now a respected Dentist in our hometown. All three of us ended up with A's in the Physics course. However, Keno and I earned our A's with an edge; Cliff apparently did not need an edge: Game, set, match to Roaf.<br /><br />What has changed is the context of our morality. Then honesty was the norm; dishonesty was made to be infinitely psychologically costly. No penalty that society could mete out would equal that one had to endure privately, within himself. Psychological guilt was part-and-parcel to our being (and seeing ourselves) as upstanding citizens. Self-enforced honesty was the price of the ticket -- the price of being a respected (and more importantly, self respecting) participant in our collective culture of honesty. We imbibed it through osmosis, through the normal socialization of arriving at adulthood (as I did in the lesson with my friend). The rules were rehearsed through example, through biblical parables and through imaginary/mythical models of integrity and fortitude. Failing these, this inner code was enforced and reinforced thorough more direct methods such as punishments or being socially ostracized, etc.<br /><br />The implicit cultural strategy then was: Yes, there are and always will be those who will cut corners, play the odds and angles, triangulate, slide through the moral crevices, and \\"game\\" or try to \\"rig\\" the system in their own favor. However, these people will see themselves (and will be seen by others) as \\"less than full moral beings\\" and they (and everybody else) knew it. Their \\"way of being in the world\\" existed on a lower rung of the moral ladder, somewhere on the border between the \\"low\\" and the \\"minimal acceptable\\" life. The \\"low\\" life was never accepted as an \\"understood\\" or as a \\"given\\" part of the American culture until recently. But now, all of our businessmen and politicians can certifiably be classified as \\"low-lifes,\\" well under the moral water line. And these are our models?!<br /><br />In short, the moral norm once was that self-respect came before respect, and that self-respect demanded that one had to tend to his own moral garden before being admitted to the larger collective cultural garden. One could not walk proudly with his chest sticking out expecting the respect of his peers without first understanding how to resist the temptation of the SMORC.<br /><br />Yet, over the decades, like everything else in our culture, inhibitions against \\"honesty as a cultural project,\\" has slowly eroded the protective moral coating that was once a given. And I agree with this author, that America's business has served as the organic wheel that is speeding downhill into the moral abyss. There is no longer such a thing as making an honest buck; all bucks nowadays are made the easy way: that is to say, dishonestly.  All our morally-challenged politicians and even our preachers, now use the SMORC as their starting point. Four Stars
B0000AKY7O|5.0|This was one of the last great albums he put out, where the whole album is full of interesting songs.  Not just a hit or two.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|It is nothing short of sad that Scott churned out such a normal hollywood version of Alien.<br />Everything is stock, predictable, making this movie actually boring at times.<br /><br />Yes, it looks great. But it does not look as good as the original, and given how the original looked in 79, this is one is downright lame.<br /><br />The reasons for why the first movie was good have been talked about for decades and it had allot to do with not doing the wrong things. all of which he does here.<br /><br />The aliens are now a dime a dozen, all different. Then you have one small alien somewho growing huge by staying in an ER room devoid of organic matter. There is not logic to the aliens, they are tiny, huge, snake like, octopus like, or microbes in slime. then the microbes become worms in the eye. Then a woman gets impregnated by the carier of the eye worms, with a different kind of alien. however, once that alien is removed she is healthy and has no eye worms. and so on.<br /><br />Worst of all, the human-aliens, who appear to be made out of wax, are seen running for their lives toward the familiar shaped pods full of aliens that are presumably their version of weapons of mass destruction. Not away from, but toward what they know to be death.<br /><br />Then you have many characters that have no function what so ever, like the Charlie Theron character, why was she there? Or weyland? He was so predictable, anybody saw that coming.<br /><br />What bothers me most is that lack of anything inovative. The aliens are much much more conventional und unsurprising than H.R.Gigers masterpiece. you will never better giger in this, so stick with it! The look of the ship was more bland und like \\"ehh, spaceship\\" than the old one.<br /><br />And the sexiness level was turned down. There is less new ground, less chances taken, here also with regards to the female cast. Who here will pretend he does not remember the scene in the first movie, where weaver puts on that space suit. This was more than 30 years ago. In this flick you got doctors who do not take of their undies, even while having mafor surgery.<br /><br />If this was NOT scott, and not alien, this would movie would be just another sci fi.<br /><br />However, there are no where near enough sci fi, and so I am glad they made it. Its better than nothing. But it also proves an old theory: good movie are LUCK, not the director. Exception may have been Lawrence's david lean.<br /><br />The movie is made watchable by Fassbender, the visiuals, and the references to Lawrence of arabia. My favorite movie of all time and one that shows how to do it right.<br /><br />Finally, there is bit of a scandal here in the news about how amazon scews its reviews systematically to push good ratings. and it is true that any rating that dislike a product or movie gets massive dings here. But I loved Alien, and this is movie is almost lazy in its attempt to cash in on that. Though, obviously, we have had allot worse with Indiana Jones, Tron, and the Horror that are the newer star wars flicks.

B004KZOXJA|4.0|I'd recently read Lauren Oliver's other book \\"Before I Fall\\" and really enjoyed it so decided to read this one as well.  These books are apparently aimed at young adults, but I am nowhere near a young adult anymore and I love them both.  The main characters are in their late teens, early 20s I think, but even as an older adult I enjoyed watching the characters grow and mature through the book.  Lauren's ideas are interesting, and I was left with much to think about after reading.  They are very easy to read, whilst also engaging, so as a busy working mum I found them both something to look forward to when I managed a spare 10 minutes to myself, but not overly taxing or complex so that I felt I couldn't enjoy them in the short time i had.  I found them both to be a great combination of intelligent reading (not just superficial escapism) and an easy-to-read and engaging writing style.<br /><br />I haven't read the next Delirium yet, I was quite happy with the way this one ended and didn't feel like I needed to follow it up with another (I didn't feel like this one was left hanging in any way), but I'm planning to read it just because I really like Lauren Oliver's style.
030758836X|3.0|Read this in 3 days and loved the back and forth between Nick and Amy, for about 3/4 of the book.  At that point, the plot became ridiculous.  Hated Hated Hated the ending.  Did the author really have to resort to such a cliche? I have to agree with another reviewer, seems like the author ran out of ideas and just ended the book.  The story could have been so much better, but in the end did not live up to its potential. Giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because I did enjoy most of the book.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is easy at first, but increases in difficultly.  Great game for my 7 year old grandson to use his thinking skills.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this game.  great to have a free app with minimal ads.only get ads between games and the ads are relevent to my interest.
B0086700CM|4.0|Exelent game, worth playing. Unless you hate addictive games, stop reading the rest of the reviews and get the game.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I've seen all 3 movies in the theater and love them.  First, I didn't enjoy the last installment (The Bourne Ultimatum) because I was looking for more action, but after watching it again (on DVD) I understand the last movie was to tie up the loose ends and give the audience a better understand of the 'bigger picture' of the character... Well written story line (that I now understand and respect)!  I already have each movie on DVD, so when the Blu-ray Box Set was available I had to buy it!  If you're a fan of the trilogy... it's a must (especially if you have a 'surround sound' system)!
0062073559|4.0|The only reason I'm giving this book four stars is because the setup takes quite a long time.  There are a LOT of characters and, while it does take time to establish each of them and their backstory/motive...it tended to drag.  That's not like Christie.  This book departs from her usual format.  There is a brief introduction to characters.  The murder happens.  Then, the bulk of the story is the unraveling and investigation.  Almost half this story is setup before the murder even happens.<br /><br />When it finally does, it's classic Christie all the way.  Things really take off and it becomes a pager-turner, especially when the bodies start to pile up.  True to her form, you'll constantly be changing who your prime suspect is as the plot evolves.  She'll keep you second guessing yourself and that's what a great mystery does.<br /><br />Out of all the Christie's I've read, I've only ever figured out who the murder was twice and this was one of the times.  It wasn't until near the end, but I did guess correctly.  Even so, I didn't know all the details of the HOW, and that's where Christie always shines.  Even though I did guess the murder, there were STILL a few unexpected turns I just didn't see coming.  Along with a terrific ending and a cast of very colorful characters, especially Salome...Death on the Nile earn it's place in the upper echelon of Christie's best.
B004LWZW8S|4.0|I have to say that I wanted to see this movie really for its 'special effects' and that it would just be an 'okay' movie (that would be driven by its special effects) but I was surprised.  It was a good movie (Action, Special effects and good story line). It's hard to say if you should 'own' or 'rent' it.  I do 'own' it.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I can't even tell you what a disappointment this movie was.  So many others have pointed out the HUGE plot holes, inconsistencies and continuity problems that they've saved me a lot of time and writing.  I will say that the film is gorgeous to look at.  Much of that has to do with the use of good, old fashioned practical effects...like miniatures used for the Star Wars films and huge sets built to human scale.  It makes very little use of CGI.  Because you're looking at REAL sets with REAL creatures, you always feel like these elements are actually in the scene with the actors because...the ARE, and it adds realism that most movies that depend on CGI today lack.<br /><br />That's the best thing about this movie.  Don't expect a cohesive story at all.  I knew the problems were going to be big when the space explorers land on a planet they've NEVER been to  and enter an alien structure they know NOTHING about only for one, supposedly educated \\"scientist\\" to say, \\"Hey, my electronic analyzer said the air is breathable out here.\\" SO HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF!  Unbelievable. About 2 hours and 100 WTF's later, the main character (minor spoiler) givers herself an automated C-section, then...PROCEEDS TO RUN AROUND LIKE RAMBO KICKING ALIEN ASS LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.  In the real world, she wouldn't be able to stand up straight let alone sprint around and kill aliens.<br /><br />When I heard that the writer from TV's LOST wrote this script, the condition of the movie made sense.  I tried to watch that series when it originally aired but found the pacing glacial at best.  It would take an entire 45 minutes of programming (minus commercials) to reveal one teeny tiny bit of information that may or may NOT be relevant to the barely-there plot...but you'll have to tune in next week folks to find out if that's so.  Ugh.  This movie FELT like it was written by a TV guy who wrote a LONG-winded series that disappointed most of its viewers after four years of loyalty for NO payoff and a WTF tacked on ending with tons of loose ends.  That's the feeling Prometheus gives you.  It's a shame so many writers now lack real STORY CRAFT and instead have to hide that deficit behind \\"cool\\" complicated and confusing \\"plots\\" so you don't realize there isn't a real story there behind all the razzle dazzle effects.
B00362J7LM|1.0|This video itself is cool but if you are buying this for 3d effect... forget about<br />it and just buy the standard bluray or dvd version. the 3d verision I have tells you to put your 3d glasses on in parts of the video & take them off through most of the video. that's why I gave this a 1 star. The 3d effect may be on this video but I have yet to experience it. I expected the whole bluray to be 3d not 3d enhanced!!
B001KP2J3U|4.0|The cast is superb, especially Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury who have the luxury of playing some very colorful characters.  Everyone right down to the great Maggie Smith in a supporting role give outstanding performances.<br /><br />I've read lots of Christie but not seen any of the films before this.  So, I can take Ustinov's Poirot performance with nothing to compare it to.  I must say, he was terrific.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this film, as with the book is that it takes too long for the murder to happen.  Yes, there are many characters and it takes time to do the proper setups and establishing of motives.  Even so, I could have done with a few less characters so the more interesting ones like Davis and Lansbury could have more screen time.  That way, the murder could have happened sooner.  This film and book depart from Christie's usual format.  Quickly establish characters.  Murder happens.  The rest of the book is the unraveling of the plot and investigation.  It's over an hour into the film before the murder happens.  That's too long.<br /><br />Once it does happen, it's classic Christie.  The pace picks up as the bodies pile up.  I've only ever guessed a Christie murder twice and this was one of the times...but it wasn't until near the end.  As usual, she has you changing suspects and second guessing yourself all the time.  Even though I knew WHO, and WHY, I didn't know HOW it was done.  Christie's attention to detail in the premeditation aspects is always highly detailed.  There were a few nitpicky things about some of these details, but I'm letting them go because the rest was so good.  Even after the murderer is revealed, there are STILL unexpected turns that I didn't see coming.  I can definitely see why Nile is in the upper echelon of Christie's body of work.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The graphics are great and I love it! It's an app for the entire family to enjoy. I'm sure you will love it to.

034580404X|5.0|This series of books gave you all the emotions there are.  It made you cry, happy and sad, made you laugh and of course made you horny.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'm not sure what I expected.  I would recommend it to anyone for good reading.  It's something you hate to put down.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|you won't regret it! I promise you that. I find it is actually easier to use than the site itself.
145162607X|4.0|I am a follower of historical fiction, and was waiting anxiously for Philippa's next book, even after being severely disappointed with her last \\"Lady of the Rivers\\". I am happy to say, we are back in action!<br />This book is far superior to her last (calamity) and a redeeming one.<br />Though the style, and story (It is history after all) is very similar to other books on the Warwick girls, I believe this was well done, even if you have read others like Jean Plaidy's \\"The Reluctant Queen\\".<br />That being said, I did feel a lot of the middle of the book was \\"fluff\\" to pad the book, and I am curious to know why Ms Gregory indicates the fate of the princes in the tower being different to the widely accepted one. Is there proof of this? Just wondering.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I felt that it was very well written and gave an insight into the victim's courage and determination to protect her child born out of her circumstances.  We hear of actual situations through the media but to have the victim describe day to day life and her amazing ability to educate her son to prepare him for the outside world and also to keep their days interesting and as normal as possible.  A wonderful description of entry into the real world for her son and her adjustment once they were rescued. A very informative read.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the games and the fact that you have to unlock others if you want more games to play.  Lots of them are fun and easy.
B005QJZ5FA|3.0|I long ago gave up trusting all the five-star reviews on Amazon; sometimes they're right on, but other times--like this one--they're really off the mark.  Lizzy does have an interesting voice, but by the end of the album it starts to grate on the nerves due to her lack of range.  There are some nice songs here that I'll probably put on a background playlist (\\"Video Games,\\" \\"Off the the Races,\\" but all in all I was more disappointed than impressed.  And who the heck thought it was a good idea to put that hip-hop \\"hey\\" and high-pitched yell (for lack of a better word) over and over again on so many songs (like \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\").  That's a major annoyance that makes me delete a song immediately from my computer because it completely detracts from the actual song that I'm trying to listen to.  All in all, it's okay, but nothing at all special; I think that most of the five-star reviewers will forget about this one when the next awesomely fabulous \\"new thing\\" comes along.
B0062WDHY6|5.0|I have already watched the full season, but now I can watch this video and really see whats going on, youknow replay, or rewind and look at still shots.....Thanks

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This was my first book to read by author, Jo Nesbo.  I feel the story and characters where so well developed.  It was a book that kept you reading to understand \\" who did it \\" to the very end.  I have recommended The Snowman, to friends and just bought another book of his.  There was a great interview with the author on NPR this summer, that got me investigating.
B0078ZYXSA|4.0|Pop music has a short memory, but Kevin Roland has made at least a couple of great albums (Don't Stand Me Down, Searching for the Young Soul Rebels) and one flat weird solo effort, while showing off his legs in a dress. The English press loves a comeback story and certainly Roland had some drama with his record companies. He is a good songwriter and a good to excellent singer. His new release got raves in England, and, which is not always the case, the positive reviews are fully deserved. This is a very well recorded and strong effort and is recommended.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game so much. and all those people who are like &quot;this is like a game I played when I was a kid!&quot; EVERYONE knows who Mario is so stop acting like anyone born after the nineties doesn't know anything! and all the haters who who hats this game you suck!
B000VH4OCW|5.0|There are plenty of other accolades for this album to be found here.  I agree w/ them. Here, I  would like to point out that this album was initially a 3-vinyl-LP album & was released the year I graduated high school, over 36 years ago. Both record label and artist have earned as much money as they deserve to make in an honest fashion by now. There is no excuse for any recordings so old, no matter how fine and appreciated, to be costing twice its original release price this many decades after its initial release, especially since there is no physical product involved. The same goes for any other releases by any artist from the past.  The greed involved in pricing this 36 year old album at 15 dollars for a tad more than an hour's music is just plain wrong.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I wish there were more options, but all in all it's fun to play. There are enough puzzles for hours of enjoyment!

B007STBUIW|5.0|What can be said about this Blu ray that hasn't been said already?  It's drinks all round to Universal Studios on their passion and commitment to restore Jaws to a visual and audio level never to have been witnessed before.  Yes, this is the ultimate release of this movie, a new beginning so to speak, to a movie which has never lost it's appeal.  This Blu ray looks better than what Jaws looked when it first projected in 1975, it's a hand sweating HD Blu ray experience, as stated by Steven Spielberg himself on the restoration process.  UK buyers can indeed pick this one up from the US, the Blu ray disc is Region free.  The DVD disc is Region 1, NTSC, which is only to be expected since this is a US release, but I would imagine that won't really be much of an issue for most people in the UK because the Blu ray disc is the main reason for purchase.<br /><br />Tremendous care with shipping and handling here, and it usually arrives well before the expected date given on the web page.  Top marks to Amazon once again for the service provided, a real treat of an import.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Prior to my move I had been very careful to place my electronic charging implements in a readily identifiable container in a priority box. When I could not locate that box in the first two days, I immediately ordered another Kindle Micro USB Cable. I have not yet found my original cable, but when I do I will be thankful to have one in my travel bag, and another to use every day. I highly recommend - for your peace of mind and the well being of your Kindle - the purchase of a spare Micro USB Cable.
B00005Y46O|5.0|I mentioned this once before in a review, but it's more relevant now: I had a fellow psychology tutor in college who mentioned that one day he was in a coffee house that played what seemed like an incessant sonic barrage of industrial heavy metal music, &quot;Then (he said), out of the blue they played some old BAD CO. and it sounded so good.&quot; Kind of like stepping from the heart of a big city into a beautiful forest. I thought about it more and realized... sure, compared to sampled, processed, and mechanical music, you were treated to four human beings actually &quot;playing&quot; their instruments. In my eternal book (or, perhaps, &quot;tome&quot;) real people playing their instruments to produce something greater than their individual parts will always trump any alternative. What's better than a studio production? But of course, a LIVE offering... with that in mind I'd like to take you to the world of &quot;FREE Live&quot;... instead of &quot;YOU WANTED THE BEST AND YOU GOT IT&quot;... you get the humble intro of &quot;The group is about to appear so let's 'upsadaisy'&quot; then POW!!! Right into one of the finest rock songs of all time... ALL RIGHT NOW.<br /><br />Before THE FIRM, before BAD CO. (and the overlooked band PEACE which gave us the blueprint for the BAD CO. classic &quot;LIKE WATER&quot;... HOLD ON TO YOUR WIGS AND KEYS... last night in one of our favorite restaurants some unseen presence played LIKE WATER on the jukebox!!!!! I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!! BLISS... MIRTH... GLEE!), Paul Rogers and Simon Kirke were in this outift along with Paul Kossoff (R.I.P), and Andy Fraser. Sophisticated blues based rock with hard rock, and softer acoustic flourishings performed flawlessly by four young men with a perfectly enviable composition and structure (further realized on a more terse, and radio friendly basis with BAD CO.). In a review of a BAD CO. live CD I complimented Rogers as being one of the finest rock vocalists ever, and this earlier live treat has him vocalizing in all of his glory with his always brilliant, resonant tone (properly sent from &quot;the mask&quot;). Kossoff's guitar playing is never less than inspired, and his Les Paul shines luminescent throughout... FABULOUS crunchy hard rock tone... wait a minute... I have to change the early morning mood setting music... sorry Claude (DeBussy), and now... OH MY, DEAD CAN DANCE (this is difficult)... but I must put on some FREE to help this process... hang on... wait here... OK, that's better... everything is truly &quot;ALL RIGHT NOW&quot;... where did I leave off... can't forget the rhythm section... this is as solid a rock foundation as you'll ever find... my experience in bands taught me that if your bassist and drummer are good this will only support and enhance the rest of the band. Fraser and Kirke are perfect (better than a metronome, or, for you studio musicians, the &quot;click track&quot; [so annoying... I do recall one clever engineer rigging ours so it sounded like a cowbell... HEY, this is easy to play with, it sounds like part of the song... MORE COWBELL!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHH HA HA HA])... Fraser is a superb bassist, and after 18 years as a drummer, and a lifetime of playing percussion, Kirke is my favorite no frills, no nonsense, uncluttered four to the floor drummer... it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />The setlist: the classic ALL RIGHT NOW opens the show, FIRE AND WATER, WALK IN MY SHADOW, THE HUNTER, MR. BIG, and GET WHERE I BELONG are all standouts. This is the one to purchase as you get a digitally remastered version, 7 bonus tracks, excellent liner notes, and some photographs never before included (Kossoff's solo in FIRE AND WATER is pouring forth from the tiny Sony speakers... MAGIC!!!!... MR. BIG has just begun... what a haunting, glorious blast of pure hard rock!!!!!).<br /><br />Complaints: yeah... this band provided numerous gems through their run, so I'd love to see an official release from later in their career... live versions of SEVEN ANGELS, SAIL ON, MOLTEN GOLD, GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE, LIKE WATER, and WISHING WELL would be most welcomed... I have two soundboard bootlegs from this era so the FREE archives should contain something.<br /><br />Balthazar also recommends BAD CO. and THE FIRM (I heard some live FIRM recently... much more lively and spirited than the studio releases, which begs the question, &quot;Why haven't these received the remastering treatment?&quot;... I'm sure this would spice them up) to the fan.<br /><br />Thanks again so much for reading this... and thanks to those who have put forth that some of the reviews have been helpful (especially that FM LIVE CD!!!!!!)...<br /><br />Be well, stay well, and have a fantastic musical life...<br /><br />ADDITIONAL: I should also suggest a recent live offering from Paul R. as a solo artist... LIVE AT HAMMERSMITH APOLLO... great performance from the vocalist, and he covers the FREE/BAD CO./FIRM triumvirate quite nicely... you're treated to STEALER, FIRE &amp; WATER, WISHING WELL, and ALL RIGHT NOW from the FREE era, ROCK AND ROLL FANTASY, and CAN'T GET ENOUGH from the BAD CO. era, AND (this was such a  surprise hidden precious stone), SATISFACTION GUARANTEED (easily THE FIRM's best song!)...<br /><br />BALTHAZAR 'AIR COOL' PLATINI, IIIns of SEVEN ANGELS, SAIL ON, MOLTEN GOLD, GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE, LIKE WATER, and WISHING WELL would be most welcomed...

B002MQYOFW|5.0|this was like the best book i ever read until catching fire and mocking jay. it was so great it was really hard to put it down when I was reading it. actually  I was up until midnight reading this book. All I have to say is too good to resist
140271453X|4.0|Some 560+ pages in length, encompassing 12 adventures and 11 memoirs, this is a fantastic book. The hardback version from Sterling Classic has a nice dust cover and a sash built into the spine to use as a book mark.<br /><br />Conan-Doyle is a master with the pen. His command of the language is both quaint, witty and somewhat verbose. It's perfect given the backdrop of Victorian England.  London of the time would have us experiencing Hansom cabs clippety-clopping along cobble stoned streets awash with the glow of gas lamps. Conan-Doyle makes the smell of the air and the noise of the times leap out the text and put the the reader right at the scene.<br /><br />Dr. Watson serves as both narrator and \\"straight man\\" as he recounts the adventures. Watson is the character Holmes uses to bounce his ideas off and, in turn, Watson asks the questions that we, the reader, would ask. It's great stuff. Holmes is usually sought after by people who find themselves in circumstances baffling to both themselves and the police. Holmes with his razor sharp focus and other-worldly insight muses and wrestles with the minutia of the case until he reaches a plausible explanation. Watson accompanies Holmes on his adventures and serves as both narrator and witness. I'm a huge fan of this work and, after reading, I'd assume most will be also.<br /><br />The great thing about short story compilations is that break points are plentiful as  each adventure averages about 25 to 30 pages each. I found myself enjoying one or two stories at a time then putting the book down whilst I read another novel or text. Upon picking it back up, there was no need to read back a page or two to recapture the thread. So is the strength of short story compilations.<br /><br />If quaint, witty, Victorian England type text is appealing, you might want to pick this book up. If you want to improve your vocabulary, read a classic, or just drift away in wondrous prose, pick this one up.<br /><br />Excellent work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book is omg too good I was about 11 when I read it abd it was so heart touching and good it was too good i will recomend this book to EVERYONE!
B0063GORYU|3.0|it's very easy. not as difficult as it should be. I win every time I play. need something that's a little more challenging
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was addicting. Can't wait for the release of Walking disaster which I already preordered. I have read and reread the book many times. I can't seem to get enough.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I really enjoy excercising my brain with these and the original Crossme puzzles.  It starts with fairly simple puzzles on level 1, but they do get much more difficult.  I rate it 5 because it was free.  I think $5 is a bit much.  If I had paid for it I would have given it 4.
B007MG360G|5.0|This game is fun, but i would have given four stars because it can get a little boring. The only reason i gave it five stars was because it said the more five stars it gets the more updates come. But overall its a pretty fun game.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Love this Disney classic. Great movie for kids and adults alike. Similar to the other classic Disney films. But one of my faves for sure.
0380807343|4.0|I'm a big fan of Gaiman's; from the Sandman series through the definitely adult novels like \\"American Gods\\". Because Gaiman is all over the place in terms of the kinds of novels he writes, and the audiences he writes for, it can be hard to pick which book works for which segment of a younger audience. Maybe that's why Gaiman's Newbery win for \\"The Graveyard Book' was so surprising to so many; I'm surprised the Newbery committee would even go near him.<br /><br />  Well, this volume seems to be ideal for a younger reader who can tolerate a bit of a scare. Because this is a creepy and ultimately very unsettling tale, it fits in pretty well with \\"The Graveyard Book\\" in terms of age appropriate scariness. Maybe then an older reader could move to \\"Stardust\\", which is a funny, deftly plotted fairy tale that is a little more demanding in terms of plot comprehension and the like.<br /><br />  Anyway, since there are lots of reviews here that extol the virtues of this book, I thought this review might be helpful just for trying to place the book in the Gaiman lineup and for helping to decide where and how to start your reader on Gaiman. Enjoy.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|We've enjoyed a Sherlock Holmes renaissance these past couple of years.<br />BBC (leave it to those Brits!) gave us a loopy, but oddly endearing<br />Sherlock for the 21st century - complete with a Watson who \\"blogs\\" his<br />irritating room-mate's adventures.  (Think Holmes, sitting naked in Buckingham<br />Palace and chuckling about it.)<br />Then there's Robert Downey Jr. - packing the plexes with his (quite accurate)<br />Iron Man interpretation - as Mr. Holmes.  Downey's Holmes is equally as manic as<br />Benedict Cumberbatch's SHERLOCK, a bit less cerebral but far more physical.  The first<br />Downey SHERLOCK HOLMES was classic stuff; but A GAME OF SHADOWS takes Holmes into<br />the larger world (to save it for a while) while matching him with his worthiest opponent:<br />Dr. James Moriarty.  There is a fine midnight train confrontation with the baddies<br />(Holmes badly disguised as a woman); an amazing flight through a foggy forest whilst<br />artillery shells whiz all around; and...<br />I won't give the \\"gag\\" away, but it's true Holmsian and occurs early in the film<br />(caught by surprise, I laughed out loud), then reoccurs to cap the climax<br />at the end (I think I fell into the lap of a beautiful brunette several seat rows<br />below!.<br />If you're a true Baker Street Irregular, or just in search of an off the wall<br />adventure, grab your magnifying glass and scope this one out.<br />Elementary.
0060825456|4.0|It seems that this volume would work really well as a first graphic novel for a younger reader. You start with Gaiman's story and beautiful, creepy prose. As a stand alone novel, \\"Coraline\\" is, after all, one of Gaiman's best and most accessible works. Then you add frequent collaborator Russell's artwork. Russell does an excellent job of presenting exactly what Gaiman has written. I don't see him at the upper end of the Wow! illustrators, or at the lower end of classic-comix types. His drawing is just solid, and an honest reflection of what's going on in your head as you read the story.<br /><br />  That's why I suggest that this is a good starter. A younger reader can clearly see and follow what's going on; the art supports even if it doesn't enhance, the story; and so the whole project is very inviting. That way, if your reader likes the graphic treatment, maybe you've set her on the way to more sophisticated and experimental work like the Sandman series, or Alan Moore, or some of the even more disturbing and/or over the top illustrators.<br /><br />  So, just as Gaiman is sometimes the fantasy author for people who don't particularly like or know fantasy, this could be the graphic novel for people who dont particularly like or know graphic novels.

B008D28HYS|5.0|I didn't even know this existed!!!! If you love the original CrossMe, you'll love the color version. There's not always a space between the different colors (in case you're like me and want to skip the tutorial), but other than that it's the same thing, now in color  :-)  I also recommend it if you like puzzles
1416955070|3.0|Clary finds out she has ability to see people no one else can: demons, Shadowhunters, vampires and the like. This comes in handy when her mother is kidnapped and Clary is attacked by a demon. She gets help from 3 Shadowhunters (Jace, Alec, Isabelle) whom she meets when she saw them killing someone.<br /><br />Since pretty much everyone seems to have read this I'll keep this short.<br /><br />I'm having little mixed feelings about this one. I liked it but I've heard so much raving about this that I was waiting something more. It started kinda slow and I kept waiting something to happen but it got better in action wise towards the end. But it seems I'm the only one thinking that so don't listen me...<br /><br />Surprisingly there wasn't any annoying characters even if Simon was boring but wasn't huge fan of the triangle between Simon, Clary and Jace. And I wish there had been more Alec! And how could you not like Jace?<br /><br />All in all it was good book if not great and I'll definitely read the next one.

0547258305|3.0|When Katsa was 8 year old she accidently kills her cousin and she learns that she has the Grace of killing. Her uncle King Randa uses her to punish everyone who displeases him and Katsa learns to hate him for this. Katsa organizes a Council that tries to help people and it is the Coucil's job to rescue the King of Lienid's father whe he's kidnapped. While on the rescue Katsa meets another Graceling with matching fighting skill who turns out to be Prince Po of Lienid and looking for his missing grandfather.<br /><br />I have some mixed feelings about this one. I enjoyed it but I'm still having problems writing my feelings about it.<br /><br />I liked Katsa, she was tough and nice but I felt that I was supposed to be more scared of her than I was. And at times she was more childish than 10 year old Bitterblue who acts much older than her age. And if you can't feel pain then why make such a huge thing about hairpins digging into scalp?<br /><br />But I liked Po (what kind of name is that?) and Raffin. Po was so cute and fun and loved the way he understood Katsa.<br /><br />It wasn't bad and I liked it but guess I was again expecting something more. I have Fire also so I'm curious to see how that one goes.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|My title is not an exaggeration. This film documents the issues that led to the 2008 financial meltdown and demonstrates that things haven't changed. The film does a good job of explaining how a few people were able to get VERY rich while essentially screwing the rest of us.<br /><br />Everybody needs to watch this film so that we can prevent this kind of economic meltdown again. I absolutely cannot recommend this film enough.

0385341008|5.0|Though this book started out a little slow for me- I was overwhelmed with the many characters involved and had to keep rereading parts to make sense of things- I was soon lost in its charming tale. About a quarter of the way through, I finally had a solid grasp on the different personalities. The entire book is told in a series of letters over the course of several months.<br /><br />England is healing in the aftermath of World War II and Juliet Ashton, a famed author, is looking for something to write about. Inspiration literally knocks on her door in the form of a letter from Dawson Adams, a pig farmer on Guernsey island who happened upon her name in a used book. This initiates an enchanting correspondence between Juliet and the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society which was formed somewhat accidentally during German Occupation. Each letter shares a story- sometimes tragic, sometimes comical- demonstrating the everyday acts of bravery and defiance that shaped a difficult time. As Juliet grows closer to these islanders and the memories they have shared, she herself becomes a part of their rich history.<br /><br />Shaffer presents the story of this small corner of the world with amazing characterization. The people of Guernsey- their habits, their stories, and their love of literature- completely enamored me. To be honest, I didn't enjoy so much the banter between Juliet and her London friends or editors. Their personal conversations seemed more frivolous than the stories of the Guernsey residents. The real magic of the book lies in the kind and quirky natures of these resilient inhabitants. This book is wonderful both as historical fiction and as testament to the power of a book club.
B007SGM084|1.0|I've never written a review for any book I've purchased before, but these are just the worst, most ridiculous, poorest written set of books I've EVER read (tbh, they are so bad, that they really defy description). Sadly, I bought the trilogy on my Kindle, anticipating a good, mindless, summer read....boy, was I wrong! Total & utter crap! I can't think of a single thing TO like about them. E.L.James tried too hard with her wording, using words & phrases normal people don't, and the repetition made 'my inner goddess want to bang her head against the wall...hard'. And don't get me started on the ridiculousness of their sex....who gets chased in a car, is so shaken up that they can't walk to the passenger side, but then has sex right then & there, or gets out of the hospital after being concussed & unconscious for days, gets home from the hospital, cries in his arms in the shower, and immediately wants sex? I honestly do not get how these books have taken off like they have. I want to sue the author for pain & suffering, they were so bad...she owes me money & time I can never recover.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Who are these 1,449 reviewers who gave it 5 stars?!?!<br />I mean, it's a good book, but not excellent. The plot has a very long beginning, so you need to brace yourself to get through first 40% of the book to get to the interesting part. The end is rather abrupt, there was still room for development. What will happen to other silos? Did they establish communication? What is happening in the outside world? Is there anyone still in charge of this project? Lots of undeveloped threads.<br />The ideas in this book are interesting though.<br />All things considered, I give it 3 stars.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|I agree, it is not a well written book by any means. I read it before it hit the best seller list and am still wondering how it did so well. As for the movie I don't think I'll be watching it.<br />Although not well written it took me back to the old Mills & Boons days and I did enjoy just wasting time by the fire reading a tennagers fantasy life. If you're looking for a book that has depth, meaning and is well written don't bother. If you just want to chill and fantasise and you have a spare few hours - go for it. Each to their own.
B00881VLCE|5.0|sweet. my daughter loves it. plays all day long beautiful puzzles. would recommend to everybody. kindle fires the best. so happy
0547564651|3.0|As other reviewers have already mentioned, this is much more of a education reform policy book than it is a parenting book.<br /><br />Maybe it is just me, but the idea that character traits such as grit or curiosity are key to meaningful success in life is just not news. Nor is the idea that a certain amount of adversity builds character, nor what that implies about the potential to change character. Also the notion that a warm, functional, caring, responsible family is likely to produce better-balanced offspring is no big surprize. So to me, the overall point of this book is a bit questionable.<br /><br />On the plus side, the author clearly put a lot of work into reading, interviewing, and observation before writing this book. And parts of the book certainly did capture my attention. Thoughts about GED's presented in the book's introduction were a revelation to me. Although I know nothing of chess, the section of the book that follows a middle-school chess team and its gifted coach greatly appealed to me. I think that every person should have a passionate, near-maniacal obsession with one thing to truly live fully, so I could really identify with the feelings of the chess players.<br /><br />I don't want to knock the book too hard, but I can't say overall it enlightened me greatly.
1609611543|5.0|Dr. Davis has done a masterful job in discussing his objective on the periphery, but he does a detailed analysis of the physiology of the body and how the components of wheat wreaks havoc on many parts of our body.  He dispels common myths or \\"party lines\\" about such things as cholesterol that has the whole country \\"screwed up\\", through no fault of the people.  I started with the diet as I heard \\"The Tip of the Day\\" on Bill O'Reilly's \\"Factor\\", and it has been about three weeks since I have been dieting.

030758836X|2.0|I had high hopes for this book - liked her first, slogged through second - but this one, alas, did not in any way, shape, or form live up to the critic's reviews or the effusive blurbs. I figured out the plot about 30 pps. into the book - life is too short to waste on trite, predictable books & this one is already in a bag in the garage, awaiting a run to the charity drop-off. Save your money.

No where is the description did it mention what region it is and that bugged me. The work around for this is to download VLC player (which is free) for your computer and that will play it. Also, the package came damaged from shipping (I presume) but it wasn't to bad. I decided to keep it because it was on;y $11 but I might look somewhere else to buy CDs next time.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Though cleverly witten and with a fair amount of tension this book was marred by gratuitous vulgarities and it was a little offputting that most of that verbiage was exchanged by brother and sister. There were no characters you could like with the exception of the two detectives.  And the ending was not satisfying. We generally like well defined and at least somewhat plausible endings, ya know.

B008PZ69RU|4.0|\\"360\\" (115 min.) is an ambitious 2011 release, co-produced by different sources and producers in France, Austria, Brazil, the UK and Slovakia. From the get-go we are thrown into convoluted story lines that take place all over Europe and the US. It takes a while to figure out exactly what is happening, but eventually a clear picture emerges. Without spoiling much of the plot line, we follow about half a dozen characters who may or may not eventually interact.<br /><br />Several comments: the movie is shot gorgeously, and in that sense feels as much as a travelogue than it is a \\"romantic drama\\" (as it was touted in the press in Belgium, where I recently saw this movie in the theater). The main problem with the script and plot (by \\"Nixon/Frost\\" writer Peter Morgan) is that at no time in the movie did I feel an emotional investment in the characters. Take for example the role of the Brazilian girl Laura (played by Maria Flor), whom we watch getting to know John (played by Anthony Hopkins), but when all is said and done, we do not learn what becomes of Laura when she drops out of sight at some point in the movie. That said, there are several performances worth noting: this movie is the 4th movie in recent months (the others being Dream House, The Deep Blue See, and The Bourne Legacy) starring Rachel Weisz, albeit in a small role, but once again she shines with the limited material she is given. Weisz is in my humble opinion one of the top actresses out there nowadays (along with Michelle Williams). Also very good is Czech actress Gabriela Marcinkova (in the role of Anna), here in her international breakout role, and I can assure you that we have not seen the last of her.<br /><br />In all, this is not a bad movie per se, but unfortunately the script is too muddled to be truly remarkable, as if the various producers wanted to make sure that enough screen time was given to the various countries involved in this production, and the reason I cannot rate \\"360\\" more than 3.5 stars. Come for the gorgeous scenery, stay for some of the performances, and that's it.tars. Come for the gorgeous scenery, stay for some of the performances, and that's it.

B006HL9G10|5.0|This is at least as good as Meditator from the i-store and less expensive. Good chime selection and timer settings. Interesting that it shows other meditators around the world, and if one wants to they can communicate with others, and log your meditation history. It is easy to use and I highly recommend it to all levels of meditating experiences. It is just what I was looking for. Nice to time a meditation and not end it with an uncomfortable alarm.<br /><br />Update 9-5-12:<br /><br />This is a very user-friendly meditation timer. I have used it many times. Very nice chime selection. Try it out and if you meditate I think you will like it, if not, cancel your purchase. Most physical meditation timers are very expensive, this is very affordable, and useful.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Yes, I titled this \\"Stephen King Fangirl.\\"  There's a reason for this - number one, I know SK is an author that you pretty much love or hate.  So if you're someone who doesn't like Stephen King, you can pass this review on by, and listen to someone else who better fits your tastes.<br /><br />But if you do love Stephen King...<br /><br />I have loved Stephen King since my mother deemed me old enough to read him.  SK is a superb storyteller.  The reason I like him so much is because he can take a story of an ordinary person, who has nothing really special or spectacular about them, and put them in such odd and incredible situations that defy reality - and make them seem perfectly plausible.  I can become so absorbed in a Stephen King novel that I can't put his works down (yes, even the crap book Tommyknockers - his worst one, and I still couldn't put it down!)  until I HAVE to, because the story is over, and there's nothing more to read except the back cover.<br /><br />Yes, I know Stephen King didn't write this book.  I'm getting to it.  Just hold on.<br /><br />I find it difficult to move to other storytellers, because SK has set such a high bar for my expectations.  I've tried other authors, other stories, but they just don't have that same... je ne sais quoi (sorry for the pretentious term, but I really can't put my finger on it) that SK has.  That way of crafting a world in my head, and pulling me in so deep that I simply cannot stop thinking about it until it's over (and then I still think about it anyway.)  JK Rowling did, and it took me YEARS to finally cave in and read her stuff - I was set up to be disappointed yet again by the hype and promises of her writing.  I was happily surprised that she's just as good at telling stories that are both real, and not real. (Real enough to disappoint you that they aren't real, and make you wish they were!)<br /><br />I guess its like horror movies - I watch a lot of them because I'm waiting to find that one that *truly*scares me - I don't watch them because I like the gore porn that is passed off as horror these days.  I watch because I know there are hidden gems somewhere in all that garbage, something that will draw me in and scare the pants off me, and one day I'll find it.  I dig through the garbage to get to that treasure.<br /><br />I apologize for rambling.  I don't write reviews that often.<br /><br />But this one was worth it.<br /><br />I just finished this omnibus, and I have found my next Stephen King and JK Rowling.  I have just finished these books, and ran into my living room to post a rare review, because people - you HAVE TO READ THESE.  If, like me, you read fiction because you want to step into another place, and become involved in character lives, and have a world of make-believe become real to you - even for a sadly short time - this is that treasure.<br /><br />In my mind, Mr. Howey's storytelling has entered the \\"elite list\\" of authors of which I will never miss a tale.  I will be watching for more releases - salivating for them - and he will be one of the few authors that I will buy without debating the purchase first.  \\"Hugh Howey wrote a new book?\\"  Off to the store I go.<br /><br />EDIT: should have looked in the store before writing the review. I'm already on Chapter 3 of the 6th book XD
B002I0J5FG|3.0|I never played these games before this collection came out, but I was always interested in them because of the praise they seem to get from the gamer community. Having played the games now, I can say that the settings, environments and ambiance are amazing and  the minimalistic stories presented in both are pretty interesting, considering how little exposition there is. The graphics look really good in this HD remake, Shadow of the Colossus looks particularly impressive, I dare to say it could even pass as a low end PS3 game.<br /><br />----------------------<br />Shadow of the Colossus<br />----------------------<br />I played this game first because it seemed like the more entertaining of the two games (I mean, just look at the cover!). Well, I was wrong. I don't know when the fun is supposed to begin. I can count on less than one hand the number of colossus battles I actually enjoyed (there are 16 total). Most of the time, I was just relieved that they were FINALLY over. Since defeating colossi is all you do in this game, that's kind of a problem. If you expect a God of War-esque boss battle that requires timing, precision, or intense manuevering, you'll be severely disappointed. Instead, you will be battling with clunky controls, iffy platforming, an inept camera, and, every now and then, unintuitive puzzle mechanics.<br /><br />I think I could accurately describe 1/3 or more of my time playing this game as just waiting. Waiting for my horse to get me to the location of the colossus, waiting for him to expose his weakness, sometimes waiting for the god character to give me a hint at what to do, waiting for the Colossus to stop trying to shake me off, waiting while I swam across some unnecessarily large lake, waiting 5 seconds for my character to get up after getting knocked down (literally, I counted). There was one Colossus, #11, that knocked me down repeatedly until I died, it never let me get back up, so I had fun waiting the 2 or 3 minutes it took for it tofinally kill me because I had given up trying to escape. Oh and if you fall off a Colossus, have fun waiting until you have the chance to get back on. There aren't many moments in my gaming history that I've felt more frustrated then when I fell off some of the taller Colossi only to have to go through the whole routine again. If you are an impatient person, stay far, far away from this game.<br /><br />There are only 2 or 3 Colossi that have any real chance of killing you, which definitely detracts from any possible feeling of excitement. Most of them don't do anything dangerous in particular and they move so slowly the only way you could get hurt is if you weren't paying any attention. And I feel the need to mention: There are only 2 battles in which you use your horse. Not surprisingly, these are by far the most exciting. I find it odd they didn't incorporate the horse you're on for significant portions of the game into more battle sequences. Talk about wasted potential.<br /><br />SotC has an expansive, beautiful environment you can choose to explore if you'd like, but it is utterly lifeless so there's not much incentive to go anywhere but to the next Colossus.<br /><br />---<br />Ico<br />---<br />This may surprise some, but I had a much more enjoyable experience with this game than with SotC, but it certainly isn't a perfect game. For one, combat in this game is atrocious.You get a weapon upgrade a few hours into the game which makes fights much shorter (thank god), but I still avoided combat like the plague. And to make matters worse, when you get hit you get knocked down for a few seconds just like in SotC. I imagine this was an intended gameplay element to increase the drama of your battles against the shadows while defending Yorda, but it only serves to increase how much I hate these stupid encounters. Taking control away from the player for such lengths of time is never, ever enjoyable.<br /><br />The camera is also pretty messy. It really isn't too big of an issue until one of the shadows grabs Yorda and starts to fly away. It's tough to figure out where they're going a lot of times and the jerking around of the camera angle only adds to my dislike of the combat. Otherwise, the camera is acceptable. I fell to my death a handful of times because I couldn't tell if I could make a jump but nothing truly gamebreaking.<br /><br />Combat isn't the main focus of this game though, so thankfully the puzzle/platforming is actually done pretty well throughout. For the most part, the puzzles are intuitive though there is one section I had to look at a walkthrough for. Turns out, I had the right solution, but the puzzle required a perfectly timed jump. I thought I was doing everything in my power to do this puzzle correctly; I must have attempted this jump dozens of times and I was fully convinced I must have missed something. I spent the next hour backtracking and looking for a solution before caving and reluctantly looking at a guide. Well I'm glad I did because I don't know if I would have kept trying that jump otherwise.<br /><br />There's pretty much no music in this game. You can play this game with the TV muted and have a nearly identical experience. I'm sure this was intended as an atmospheric device, and I'm sure some people might prefer it that way, but this is a pretty big knock on the game as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />----------<br />Conclusion<br />----------<br />In the end, these games, while sharing similar aesthetics and story-worlds, are completely different in how they play out. Overall, I think Ico is the better of the two games by far. My biggest gripe with SotC is that I feel like I'm not doing anything a lot of the time, just waiting around. Exploring the castle in Ico actually serves as a means to an end; you need to figure out where to go. Ico does a much better job of giving the player the feeling of making progress. This feeling is aided by the fact that you will see parts of the castle you'vealready passed through as you advance, making you think \\"hey I remember this place.\\" Except now you're seeing it from a different angle, forcing you to realize how far you've come. The only sense of progress I felt in SotC was seeing my colossus kill count increase. The game lacks a cohesiveness to tie it all together. This lack of focus is the reason the game seems to drag on and doesn't feel rewarding in my opinion. There is no story explanation in SotC until literally the end of the game, you get no weapon upgrades or new moves to use (not in your first playthrough at least), and the world is empty and lifeless. Right when you kill one colossus you're immediately on to go kill the next which makes the game feel like a never ending MMO fetch quest. SotC just comes off feeling disjointed and like a series of side-quests compared to Ico's very focused and linear journey. When I look back at SotC, I remember it in separate bits and pieces; my recollection of Ico is all the puzzles and environments blending together seamlessly into one unique experience.<br /><br />I honestly have very few positive things to say about Shadow of the Colossus. It isn't necessarily an awful game, it's just not fun. I'm not sure how the developers managed to make battles with huge towering giants boring and forgettable, but they did. I can't recommend this collection for SotC, but Ico is a worthy game that holds up pretty well, even though it was made 4 years earlier (yikes).<br /><br />I do suggest you play this collection, despite all the negative things I've mentioned. They are both pretty short; Ico lasts from 5-6 hours, SotC is about 7-8. I'm sure if I played these games back in 2001 and 2005 I would have liked them more, but I can't rate games based on what ifs.

B000VDUWMC|5.0|This book is the long answer the question: Why did the Europeans developed so much technology and conquered the other continents and not the vice versa? Why was it that Europeans and their descendants become to dominate the world instead of native Africans, Americans, Australians, Chinese or New Guineans?<br /><br />The main conclusion was that societies developed differently because of differences in continental environments, not in human technology, centralized political organization, and other features emerge only in dense sedentary populations capable of accumulating --populations that depended for their food on the rise of agriculture B.C. But the domesticable wild plant and animal species essential were distributed very unevenly over the continents. The most species were concentrated in only nine small areas of the globe,homelands of agriculture. The original inhabitants of those homeland got a head start toward developing guns, germs, and steel. The languages inhabitants, as well as their livestock, crops, technologies, and dominant in the ancient and modern world.<br /><br />The main message of the book is that the most of the world's domesticable plants and animals were concentrated to Eurasia giving head start to Eurasia for developing food surplus required for development of complex societies able to support professional armies and inventors bringing technological Eurasia had additional huge advantage over America and Africa being East-West orientation without significant deserts or bottlenecs in between allowing fast spread of new plants and inventions by keeping societes connected.<br /><br />Why Europe, why not China is also answered. Argument is that early integration of whole China under single rule discouraged innovation. Single ruler could stop new invention of being applied (several examples were given), whereas situation in Europe with dozens of independent states virtually guaranteed that one of states implemented any useful invention and if newinvention was giving them advantage (like firearms), it quickly spread to neighboring countries. Neighbors either implemented the invention or were promptly conquered by their neighbors.<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone interested in human history.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I found this book fun to read and a bit interesting. I thought it was going to be a little darker than it was. I have all three books and I think the writer could have put all three into one as there was a lot of repeating. Still I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. Kinda gets the fires going, if ya know what I mean!
B003VANOFY|2.0|This is a great headset in terms of features, sound quality, etc. I have really enjoyed it. I bought the headset about 8 months ago. The plastic pieces above the ear cups have crumbled. One is gone, the other is going. Yes, there is a metal piece that actually attaches to the ear cup, but the metal piece is held in place by the plastic assembly. When the plastic assembly crumbles, the metal piece is not supported and the ear cup dangles by the wire attached to it. I am now in the process of returning this to Logitech for replacement. I have taken very good care of this headset and have not been hard on it or abused it in any way. There is without question a design or production flaw in the plastic assembly above the ear cups. Other than that it is a great product. Hopefully a new model will be released that will correct this flaw. Unfortunately until this is corrected I recommend that you avoid this product.

B006SAR0OK|5.0|Let me start out by saying I'm a huge Tarantino fan. So, this might be a little bit biased. I loved Volume 1 and Volume 2 didn't disappoint. I don't know how it took me this long to see these movies but I suppose it's better late than never. In the second installment \\"the Black Mamba\\" continues on her revenge journey. Expect more kick-ass fight scenes, some stomach curdling twists and turns, and a healthy dose of flashbacks. In short, expect everything that you loved about the first part.

B007KOYEOC|5.0|An amazing ending to such a good triligy of the 50 Shades series. It was one of the stories that really got you in. once you started reading the first book you couldn't put it down wondering what was going to happen next. Not a story that I normally would be interested in, but a girlfriend talked me into reading them. Just couldn't put it down. Loved the set, great story line, that just sucked you in.  Loved them !!!

1451627289|5.0|The time travel device of this book works because King is interested not in the Sci-Fi elements, but in the emotional and philosophical issues raised by the idea of time travel.  Thus, there is little explanation of how the time travel device works -- it's just there, as a &#34;rabbit hole&#34;.  The reason we never get tired of reading about time travel is our desire to correct our mistakes; our desire to know whether there is a design in the universe - is life simply absurd and do we truly choose our own destinies; and the sneaking feeling of nostalgia that maybe things were better back in the day.  King thinks that while we can make a difference by our life choices, neither the past (nor the present, for that matter) really can be changed fundamentally.  All we can do is fall in love and make a difference in the immediate world around us.  As for the past -- in some ways it really was a lot better.  The food is better; the cars are better; the sense of freedom and control of our own destinies is stronger.  But the racism, tolerance for squalor, and environmental irresponsibility of the past can't be sustained.  In that sense,we can truly say we are making some progress.  The people are about the same, though King captures some of the real nastiness of 1963 Dallas and 1958 New England.  But even in these environments, truly strong, admirable, and unforgettable characters emerge.  On the downside, King does tend to the sentimental and some characters and conversations are real clunkers.  And while I'm satisfied with the conclusion, I think the alternative histories offered could have been a bit more subtle and compelling.  But the book is plain excellent and impossible to put down.  It will make a great movie -- and hopefully one is made.

1476712042|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is a very different kind of love story. Jamie McGuire has written a beautiful, heart-felt story about two people who are dysfunctional, but together they become functional. I'm the kind of reader that while I'm reading a novel the story becomes a part of me. So Abby and Travis's relationship had me very emotional. I was laughing, angry and crying. Even though I spent three-fourths of my time crying while reading Beautiful Disaster, I fell in love with Abby and Travis' love for each other. And for me, I could understand them--that when you find the right person, their love can make you a better person. Their love encourages you to want to be a better person and it gives you the hope to know you can be better a person. Beautiful Disaster also reminded me of the truth in the proverb: Two together are stronger than one alone.<br /><br />Abby came to Eastern University to leave her dysfunctional life and father behind her, but little did she know that the life she left behind would be her strength for the guy she would fall in love with. Travis was very close to his mother whose love was everything to him. She died when Travis was three, so this left a huge hole in his heart, with the added feelings of abandonment from the one person who was to give him the neutering love needed to teach him about love and trust.<br /><br />Travis is a motorcycle riding, bad boy, who oozes sex and rebelliousness. The only thing he cares about is his Harley, fighting in the underground illegal fights for money, and bagging every pretty girl. And that's not hard when every girl is falling at his feet to be with him. But there is one girl who's not gone all swoon crazy for this gorgeous bad boy. Abby's going to give bad boy Travis the tough love he needs to heal his dysfunctional heart.<br /><br />I loved Abby and Travis's messed up romance. Their love for each other ripped my heart to pieces, had me crying my eyes out and had me fanning myself from their sizzling hot bedroom scenes. But what I love the most is they are each other's equal, that their love will be strong enough to heal their dysfunctional lives.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is a heart-touching, beautiful story of how the power of love can heal two dysfunctional people who are each other true soul mates. I highly recommend Abby and Travis' love story as a must read.room scenes.

B002SAUCBC|3.0|The Long Walk is a classic from the Bachman books, and a story that sticks in the psyche for many years. This clearly dated novel is the pre-amble to the Hunger Games, and I feel is far more horrifying. When transferred from the book to Kindle it is filled with far too many type O's and some of the words are separated with hyphens to enunciate syllables (Garr-aty). After a while I have to figure out what is being said because of the large amount of mispelled words. That's irritating.  Buy the book used for a reduced price if you would like to read it the way it's supposed to be written.

I don't understand what the hell anyone would think was good about these books.  If you hate these books, here are some really funny videos I found on youtube.  You see I have a relative, who is a virgin with an eating disorder.  She dates the worst men she could.  Then she recommends this book to me.  Oh I finally understand her facination with this book.  It's her.  I wanted to know how the books turned out so I could just understand what the hell is wrong with her.  I read the first book.  I just could not read the second one, but I needed to know how it turned out.  So these videos help me out.

B005SPFB06|4.0|Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.<br /><br />Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of \\"Desperado\\" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.<br /><br />What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.<br /><br />Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious \\"Danza Kuduro\\" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.<br /><br />There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.<br /><br />The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.<br /><br />That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.<br /><br />Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.<br /><br />Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.<br /><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Steelbook Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.

B0000062GE|5.0|This is a well listened album by a band that should still be relevant today.  The lead singer is sharp, and his high register is fierce.  I love the combination of all the instruments...pure madness and melody, coupled with a pinch of poignancy.

B0053KWDES|5.0|Alright,  this is my first review ever.  I am new to the headphone amp bandwagon and must say I like it very much.  I started with the FiiO E6 to add an extra kick to the Klipsch S4 from my Ipod touch and it works flawless. I connected it to my HD-580 and it was ok but not great.  So I decided to purchase the E11 to power these cans, and holy s*** they came alive.  Should have bought this first, but now I have a backup, just in case and the E6 is small enough for my evening runs.  The E11 is lighter than I thought, the quality is higher than the price you pay for and the band that comes with it makes attaching this little piece of heaven to my ipod a cinch.  I have several cans (MDR-V900, ATH-M50S, ATH-ANC7b, AHD-1100, CX300II)and this is by far the best purchase I have made for them, especially for the HD-580 and ATH-ANC7b (due to their higher impedance).  It adds a new dimension and life to my music.  You will not regret the purchase.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I don't read much but decided to see what all the \\"fuss\\" was about I did enjoy it. Hard to put down
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Rush is my favorite band and while I initially wasn't thrilled with this album, it has grown on me.  The music and lyrics for BU2B are some of the most relevant to my life that Rush has ever composed.  Also, The Wreckers is a fantastic song that is buried a little over halfway through.  For my opinion on the rest of the album and the album as a whole, it's not that the musicianship is anything less than anyone should expect from the guys.  It's more because I feel like most of the songs run together sonically, which, to me, actually takes away from the concept record that they created.  Many of the vocal tracks seem somewhat cloudy and hard to understand and I would have appreciated different mixing for the vocals.  I'm not sure that I can find myself playing this album over and over like so many other Rush records, including the two most recent that have the most similar style to this one.
B008XBCJ34|2.0|OK, I did buy the first theatrical version that was put out....THEN he releases the extended edition, which I happily bought because it was a better version...but now were gonna try and sneak in a 3D version of the theatrical edition? Most fans already have the extended verision after buying the original, why on earth would you go back to the shorter version just because it's 3D? SHAME ON YOU JAMES CAMERON! Sounds like a Star Wars product release, as if no one learned from that mess...(which is not done yet...3D)! I will gladly wait for the extended edition 3D bluray! PLEASE do NOT encourage this behavior!!! It is a wallet raping!
B007P6VLRS|4.0|This album reminds me of why I loved Smashing Pumpkins in the first place.  The mix of volume, style, and lyrical imagination takes me back to a time when the band looked a bit different than they do now.  The new drummer exceeds my expectations and I love the apparent trading of guitar parts between Billy and Jeff.  The bass tracks are also strong.  For a refreshing rock record, check this one out and take yourself back to a time when modern rock art was about more than making pop singles.
0756405890|5.0|Okay, so I've just gone through the nay-sayers' reviews of the book, and I'd like to point out the reasons for some of the apparent \\"flaws\\".<br /><br />First, the fact that the story is \\"slow moving\\": The purpose of the first book in the series is not to be the \\"action-packed adventure\\" that it seems that all other fantasy books are. Rothfuss makes a point of writing a books in which the protagonist is not some 14 year old kid who finds himself swept off in some adventure based purely on luck. He writes a book that is plausible; yeah, sure, the kid is skilled, more so than the average kid, but he's not Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, who are both prophesied to be carried to greatness. There is no legion of well-wishers and supporters for Kvothe. The vast majority of the story is him trying to advance himself without any wealth to speak of to fall back on. If you read the second book, when he is slightly older and has had time to hone his skills, the story become much more adventurous.<br /><br />Second, \\"all the women are flat\\". Throughout the story Kvothe has said probably a dozen times that he has no skills whatsoever when it comes to women, so when he's describing his interactions with the fairer sex, of course he's not going to be able to discuss the subtleties of the conversation. Again, in the second book, when he's a little older, his descriptions of his interactions with women make the characters seem more vibrant.<br /><br />Last, the fact that Kvothe is \\"overtalented\\". He's really not. The various skills that he has picked up and that he uses in the story (i.e. sympathy, lute, thievery, etc.) all come from the various situations that he's lived in. As an urchin, yeah, it makes sense that he would learn lockpicking. By being tutored for years by Abenthy, yeah, he probably would have gotten a grasp of sympathy. His lute playing obviously would have improved if he had spent a month and a half sitting in the forest doing basically nothing else. The only actualinnate skill that Kvothe has is that he's damn smart. That's what lets him pick up the other skills so quickly. He's not invincible, he's just clever.<br /><br />If you're gonna whine about the story, at least have the decency to read the whole thing. Honestly, I love it more every time I read it, I love Wise Man's Fear even more, and I am so excited for Doors of Stone.
0307477479|5.0|A Visit from the Goon Squad is about a group of average people trying to survive in NYC. Their joys, sorrows, triumphs and failures are told in Egan's lively, intellectually-tinged prose, helped by continual allusions to music in all of its complexities. The characters revolve around each other in musical patterns, and are as taken and dismayed with their issues in life as instruments in a chamber piece. What I appreciated most about the book, though, was how completely engrossing it is; you care about Egan's characters, the noble as well as simple, and their arcs are easy to understand and even relate to. The writing is modern and entertaining, with just enough layers to reward multiple re-readings. And the PowerPoint chapter, widely divisive as either genius or gimmicky, is a little of both, but also oddly moving in its cryptic innocence. Well-deserving of its Pulitzer, this is a brave book that's necessary reading for any fan of modern American lit.
1935597760|1.0|I came to the first unfortunate chapter about the poor boy in the orphanage. I am so disgusted by books that use child abuse as entertainment. I will delete this thing off my Kindle and I guess lose my money. Its a pretty expensive book and I am not happy that it is one of these haunting stories. It is marketed as a quirky love story with no warnings about child abuse. Buyer beware.<br /><br />The book description under the paperback version says \\"charms and delights with its authentic characters and gentle humor\\" but that is not accurate. Be sure to read the description under the Kindle version which is much more real. I deleted it from my account.

0374275637|5.0|I first encountered the work of Daniel Kahneman and his collaborator Amos Tversky when I was in graduate school.  A student of artificial intelligence, I was keenly interested in the question of how to design systems that can behave \\"rationally\\" despite their computational limits.  I was thinking about computer systems, but of course human beings are also systems that have limits on the amount of \\"computation\\"--or at least thinking--that they can do.  The adage of economists that rational behavior consists in doing the actions that do the most to further one's goals given one's beliefs simply didn't seem to make a lot of sense when considered from a computational perspective:  weighing one's options in light of one's goals and beliefs takes time, and if you try to weigh all your options, the world will change before you've finished.  As various people have said, human beings are not \\"frictionless deliberators.\\"<br /><br />Enter Kahneman and Tversky, whose work showed that people deviate in systematic ways from the standard model of rational thinking.  The key insight is that the deviations are systematic--and they're systematic in ways that accord with having finite reasoning capabilities.  It's not that people are irrational--Kahneman bristles at that description of his results.  Rather it's that the model of rational thinking developed by the economists may be fine as a normative model, but can't work as a descriptive one.<br /><br />Kahneman and Tversky collaborated on psychological studies of reasoning for more than a decade, writing hugely influential papers, including their 1974 Science article \\"Judgment under Uncertainty:  Heuristics and Biases,\\" which is amongst the most highly cited paper in economics, and which reproduced in full in \\"Thinking Fast and Slow.\\"  Tversky died in 1996 at the age of 59, but Kahneman went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics for their joint work in 2002.  Indeed, \\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\" is a joy to read not only for the science it contains, but also, secondarily, for the touching accounts he provides of his long collaboration with Tversky.<br /><br />This is Kahneman's magnum opus:  an overarching review of 50 years of research that he conducted, first with Tversky, and subsequently with other leading social scientists.  It's remarkably accessible, even when he's describing somewhat arcane points of psychology.  Amongst the many cognitive biases he describes are these:<br /><br />* Seemingly little things that make it easier to process information--the size or darkness of the font in text, for example--have a powerful effect on the likelihood that you will believe or approve of the information.<br /><br />* We readily adopt a principle of WYSIATI--what you see is all there is.  We neglect the possibility that our conclusions may be biased by having only incomplete information.<br /><br />* We tend to apply a halo effect in assessing other people's character or capabilities:  we make specific assessments based on overall impression of them, and the errors that this induces are compounded by WYSIATI.<br /><br />* When we're trying to answer a challenging question, we often substitute an easier one, without even realizing it.<br /><br />* Our numeric judgments are biases by \\"anchoring effects\\" in which we are swayed by  sometimes irrelevant numbers that we encounter during our reasoning process.<br /><br />* We often assess the quality of an experience by what happens at the end of it.<br /><br />These are just six of the dozens of biases that Kahneman describes.  For each bias, he presents the sometimes astonishing psychological studies that support it.  For example, the last bias was uncovered in experiment with a group of patients who underwent colonoscopies in the early 1990s, when anesthesia was not well-administered for these procedures.  One group of patients had a few extra minutes added to the procedure at the end, during which they experienced a relatively reduced level of pain.The patients in that group felt that the experience was overall less unpleasant, even though they'd experienced all the pain of the other group plus some more!<br /><br />There's an overarching coherence to Kahenman's work:  he explains human decision-making and the cognitive biases it includes, in terms of two systems:  a quick-and-dirty Malcolm-Gladwell-like System 1, which, when needed, provides information and tentative conclusions to a more effortful, deliberative System 2.  However, while you might be tempted to think that the errors produced by the types of cognitive biases listed above are solely the result of System 1, that would be incorrect.  In fact, the connection between \\"accurate\\" reasoning and two systems is more complex, and even when humans rely on System 2, they are still not able to behave in the \\"fully rational\\" ways that would be specified by classical economics.  It takes some careful reading of Kahneman's book to sort this out, but on careful consideration one realizes that even with System 2 the economist's rationality can't be fully obtained.  How could it, by creatures with finite brains?
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|\\"THE HELP\\" did take some liberties with how it was in the 1960's but rang true in many cases. It was a delightful movie..some of the slang not needed. This movie is a great story on how it must have been in some communities. This is a \\"chic-flick\\" and I truly enjoyed it. The hair, the clothes and accents were right-on! Although I was reared in the \\"south\\", I was never allowed to be disrepectful (no sass-mouthing) to anyone...white or black! And I do like chocolate pie!!!!  Yum, good southern cooking!!! Brought back some memories!!
B0026WNGBA|4.0|First and foremost: do not have it as e-book. This is probably true for most of manual-alike books (I had similar experience with a swimming manual), but with ChiRunning you are going to miss the at-a-glance capability only the paper can give you.<br />Anyway, this is indipendent from the book, that is a GREAT book on running.<br />I have read a great number of books on sport, several manuals and guides: this is something \\"different\\". The approach is different: here Danny, the author, start from Tai Chi to get to a new running concept.<br />Well done, interesting even for a convinced Cartesian as myself, always critical towards Oriental disciplines (notwithstanding my long residential experience in Far East).<br />Other than paper edition, I would suggest DVD: ChiRunning videos you can recover from the network are not exaustive (not at all).<br />Probably a stage with a Certified ChiRunning Instructor would be the best completion, but unfortunately courses seem to be available in US only.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is soooooo fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-) i play it EVERY day because it is so fun!!! You  get points every day,not too hard or too easy,and its fun to raise your own village of animals!!!

B0078ZTWP4|2.0|This lantern looks just like the Rayovac 300lm lantern on amazon. We ordered that one for $25 and we are very satisfied with it. Since this is a no name brand, I assumed it's the same lantern as the Rayovac and wanted to save a few bucks. Big mistake! This lantern says on label 300 lumen but in fact when compared side by side with the rayovac one, this one is about 1/3 less bright. I opened the lantern and was shocked to find out there's only 1 LED chip, versus the 3 LED chip Rayovac lantern. The single LED in this lantern is bigger than the individual LED chips in Rayovac model but the light output is definitely not as much ! Spend a few more dollars and get the rayovac one you would be glad that you did!
0345803485|1.0|A synopsis of the new best seller amongst men the world over, Fifty Shades of Green:-<br /><br />When literature student Nicholas Irons goes to interview young entrepreneur Christine Green, he encounters a woman who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. Christine Green is a billionaire who speaks fluent French, is basically a concert level pianist, is a fully trained pilot, is athletic, drop dead gorgeous, tall, built perfectly with large breasts, and the best lover on the planet. In addition, she's not only self-made but is using her money to combat world hunger. The unworldly, innocent Nicholas is startled to realize he wants this woman and, despite her enigmatic reserve, finds he is desperate to get close to her. Shocked yet thrilled by Green's singular erotic tastes, Nicholas hesitates. For all the trappings of success--her multinational businesses, her vast wealth, her loving family--Green is a woman tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. Unable to resist Nicholas' quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Green admits she wants him, too--but on her own terms. When the couple embark on a daring, passionately physical affair, Nicholas discovers Christine Green's secrets and explores his own dark desires........
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. graphics are good. tasks are easy and no energy limitation. good stuff. it sucks you in and time disappears quickly.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Very good turn based strategy game.  Addictive.  Better on tablet, but good on phone. 3 races -  similar to Starcraft.  Use boats to win.
B00846REIS|4.0|Not as good as 50 Shades but attention grabbing enough to read book #2. Worth the price of the book.
0345528581|5.0|I definitely recommend the book instead of the Kindle version, so that you can flip back and forth easily to find exercises. This is a great fitness program.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased the first book of the series, instead of the trilogy, simply because I wanted to make sure I was going to like the story, not just the adult content. And as it turned out, I did get hooked into the plot, which prompted me to purchase, and devour the other two books in this series. I would reccommend 50 Shades to all my girlfriends!
B008GOAFBQ|2.0|A. A reissue of the first album on cd and 180 gram virgin vinyl without \\"Kissin' Time.\\"<br /><br />Admit it.<br /><br />You'd buy it.<br /><br />I would.<br /><br />A vinyl copy at least.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|A wicked - and well-done - contemporary take on Pride & Prejudice. Wittily written, cleverly directed, beautifully acted. As fans of Jane Austen, we found it totally entertaining.

1932100660|5.0|One of the best books about diet and health ever written. Everyone should be aware of the link between animal protein and cancer, so that they can protect themselves and their families. The author also appears in the documentary Forks over Knives, a good film about fighting disease with diet instead of drugs.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like these kinds of games. I am 12 and to me these games are fun. I get most of these games but this one so far is my favorite. The reason is probly becuz u don't have to spend a lot of gold like on the other story games. I just found out there's a &quot;monster story&quot; so amazon hurry up and get that one too
B007712XAU|5.0|I thought that Downton Abbey was the best 2 movies I & II  I have seen in my lifetime!! The acting was the greatest. I think the costumes were so very elegant. I judt can't say enough about these movies I bought them right away I started watching on PBS but I also missed a couple.<br />Thenn I went to Amazon and bought them I can't wait for the III series to come out it's driving me crazy having to wait.<br />Thank you,<br />Kathy
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Awful characters.  I did not care what happened to any of them. Ana needs to grow up.  Grey is a creep.  This is a love story?  What?  Crappy writing.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|Sluggish is the term that comes to mind when assessing the quality of this adaptation of a brilliantly conceived book. I wasn't expecting a literal adaptation & the film obliges by some rather odd content organization. Apart from that issue, the film has major flaws, probably the worst of which is the director's choosing to substitute murky lighting & audio for suspense. Not exactly a bad film, this isn't very good either. The individual performances, on the other hand, are excellent, especially that of the young leads. Sorry to gripe so much, but I was really looking forward to this and am frustrated at the missed opportunity. On the plus side, even the mediocre end result can't obscure the horror Collins evoked so well in the book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|challenges make this game new &amp; exciting every time you play it...me &amp; my kids love to play this game!!
B008Y5OWSO|5.0|A lire les premiers avis de vos clients, les bras m'en tombent....A force de se droguer aux effets spéciaux, aux histoires standardisées et aux scénarios élastiques des séries TV qui s'étirent sur des années, le public US ne sait plus regarder un film. Je le crains. C'est un comble. Le cinéma a été inventé pour eux par leurs pères quelque part en Californie.... Heavens Gate est leur histoire. C'est un film dur, qui raconte toute la difficulté qu'il y eut à constituer un peuple fait de millions d'immigrants européens de culture et d'intérêts souvent opposés. La beauté de ce film repose surtout sur la grandeur du peuple américain qui parvint à dépasser la violence pour se constituer en nation cohérente, unie quand il le faut par de très grands idéaux. Alors Mesdames et Messieurs, regardez à nouveau ce film et dites-vous bien qu'il ne critique pas l'Amérique. Il rappelle simplement au monde que les pires situations politiques ne constituent pas forcément la fin de l'espérance!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|How can you not fall in love with the characters in this book. From the very first page I couldn't put it down! I laugh, cringed, cried & fallen in love. Travis is your all around womanizing bad boy! The fighting part reminds me of Fight club & kept me on my feet. It's been a while since I've had a book that pulled my heart strings! Definite read and has got to be one of my all time unforgettable books! 5 stars all the way! I cant wait for book #2!

B008BIN9EW|4.0|If you start with the Campaign, then you go through the tutorial, which helps.<br /><br />This is a lot like a pared down version of Advance Wars for DS.  Very pared down.  It has decent graphics for a mobile app game.  The battle system is kind of wonky at times though.  It is turn based, not real time.<br /><br />It does have some pretty deep strategy style options, but not the exacting planning of attack as Advance Wars or the super resource hoarding like Warcraft 2 and 3, Starcraft, and Age of Empires.  It is on a hex grid system, so it does make it easier to put units into a space and attack based on proximity and range (like Advance Wars).<br /><br />Basically, if you like Advance Wars, this is a simpler version of that style of turn based strategy game.  I do recommend trying it out though.  It's pretty fun.

8862933177|1.0|I've been happily using Moleskine notebooks and this is the first time I'm using a Passions Journal. I like the minimalist concept and the quality of paper. However, the alphabetized tabs of six review pages each seems more of a LIABILITY than an asset to me. Why? So far, I have already watched and reviewed five movies and my journal still feels and looks empty because they're scattered everywhere following the stringent alphabetization of the titles of the movies that you watch.<br /><br />In other words, it doesn't make me feel like I had accomplished writing a lot of reviews as I would've if only I could write down my entries chronologically and see what I had written page after page. The alphabetization is a weak feature for me especially because in the back pages they already have blank index of the movies so why the alphabetized tabs especially when you can only review a limited number of six films under each letter?<br /><br />To fill this journal with your valuable insights about the movies you watch, you got to watch movies with titles that you can equally distribute across twenty-six letters multiplied by rooms for six films. But the question is, what happens once you run out of room under certain tabs?<br /><br />With an already efficient pagination and a blank index in the back, what's actually the great benefit of the limited alphabetized tabs?
B000002KHH|5.0|This is the disc that really kicked metal into high gear. This is the early career of Ozzie and all the bad press that came with these types of bands. If you really like hard core rock this is for you.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|...kidding me! This is by far the worst Cohn movie made. Sasha takes a good idea & then totally messes it up with gutter humor, stupid jokes & some sick need for him to display his gonads to every last person in the world. Don't waste you money on this film. It is a loser. The other interesting thing about Cohn is that he always finds a way to diss conservatives but it literally the best example of liberalism run amok. He is just not funny anymore-simply stupid. If you are a 12 yr. old or have the IQ of your average cabbage, this movie is for you.  Otherwise, skip it & watch the grass grow.
030758836X|2.0|Book started off pretty slow. It got to the point that I was reading reviews to decide if I were to finish novel or not. After reading about how horrible the ending was, I got curious and wanted to see for myself what everyone else was talking about. First half of book was slow and didnt keep me interested. 2nd half got more interesting, and I was hoping for something great, but instead I finished the book feeling disappointed and unfulfilled.
0345803485|1.0|I read the entire trilogy, page to page, and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />It was that much of a train wreck.<br /><br />This book is...amazing. I've read my share of books, and even the ones I could barely stand (hello, Blubber) aren't nearly as disgusting as this. The writing is awful, the premise is weak, the majority of the characters are bland, and the sex scenes aren't even that hot! Everything that's supposed to be \\"kinky\\" is boring, and the scenes that should be amazingly hot...aren't. And don't even get me started on what passes for a romantic relationship. Double standards, love martyrdom, abuse? This is supposed to be a beautiful love story?<br /><br />Anastasia Steele was an irritating character on her own, but having to slog through her POV made her even MORE annoying. I don't mind self-deprecating heroes and heroines, but I do mind the ones who think complaining about how plain they are makes them special somehow. And Christian? The less said about him the better, lest I go into a rage and use language I shouldn't. He's a grade-A creep, the end. Everyone else aside from Kate, Elliot, Taylor and Mia was filler, just there to champion or cause trouble for the Ana-Christian romance.<br /><br />I wish I could say the ending with Ana leaving the jerk made me happy, but it didn't. Because there are two more books and I knew what was coming after this.<br /><br />I want the last three weeks of my life back.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Awesome movie, for all the family! Beginning seems a little sad, but you will forget it with the rest of the movie. Amazon streaming service is very good.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I have used several different battery monitoring programs and this is by far the best.  The best thing is that you get estimated times on how long you can read or surf the web. Highly recommended.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|very gripping to begin where you feel unable to put the book down, but I found the final book a little disappointing, with unexplained gaps where you were left to fill in the blanks.  It left me feeling that more should follow.  A good read generally.

B008D28HYS|5.0|Just giving my 5 because the game is excellent like the regular CrossMe, and to try to offset the 1-star permission wahmbulance. If you don't like the permissions requested, just don't install it, giving 1-star is the lowest form of douchebaggery. Serial 1-star faotd raters should be banned from the appstore, more so when the permissions are NOT excessive, as it's the case here.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is very much like pioneerville or farmville on facebook except there are easier ways to get acorns. just like some of the games on facebook you need money to accell to the next level.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|i have to say as a 14 year old, i use to be in Disney poppy crap. when i was 12 i liked Miley Cyrus and all that stuff. now this album saved my life as a 12 year old, and for that i am grateful.<br />i remember hearing about MCR on the internet and the whole \\"suicidal cult\\" daily mail bull. but something...this little voice told me \\"give them a try\\". so i did. i remember \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prision\\" being the first song i ever heard by them, and i loved it. it was different, ambitious, it made me feel free. id dance around my room to that song, shortly followed by \\"Helena\\". i was hooked. and then came \\"Welcome To The Black Parade\\"...after i listened to that, i never looked back. i splurged on the whole album. to this date its my favorite.<br />The Black Parade is literally epic. one day it will make you headbang around your room like a maniac, and another day it will make you cry. you know an album is good if it can make you feel multiple emotions like that. The Black Parade is dark, funny, creative, smart, and leaves you with a sense of hope at the end. i have to say i have to listen to at least one song from TBP a day to cope. its definately changed my life, my music taste, my way of doing things. it changed me. i know this is coming from a teenager, but buy this and you wont regret it. wheather you are 14 or 64, i think TBP has something for everyone. from the classical rock mania of \\"Teenagers\\" to the sad and depressing instrument driven \\"Cancer\\" to the epic crazy masterpiece \\"Welcome To The Black Parade\\". this album is definately something amazing that happened to music. but after all Rob Cavallo (Green Day, Paramore) produced it. buy this, listen to it, just do it. you wont regret it.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I ordered this boxed set of Friends and almost every disc is scratched and skips.  I could actually see the scratches on these  \\"brand new\\" discs.  Beyond frustrated!!!
0307719219|4.0|As I'm finishing the book I'd like to point out at least some very important deficiencies.<br /><br />But before I do so as a parenthesis: though the book is incomplete, in my mind a bit naive in some ways, nonetheless this is a solid book that's a must read for all interested in economics and/ or politics, as it brings into focus the often neglected view of the correlation between politics and economics (the mantra of the book being that inclusive political institutions bring about inclusive economic institutions and foment a spread of a nation's wealth as well as political rights. To summarize, democratic politics = democratic economics = wide spread prosperity).<br /><br />Now for the weaknesses: the book has some serious voids in the presentation of it's theory. As an example when it describes Guatemala's \\"vicious circle\\" in chapter 12, and simply states that the democratic regime in 1945 was overthrown by a coup in 1954. After discussing Guatemala's political ills and the historical lack of \\"inclusive institutions\\", it gravely omits then to make the slightest discussion as to the 1945 overthrow.<br /><br />For this omission one must read the likes of William Blum. At least some background references to the possible reasons for the knocking down of the Guatemalan democratic government should be at least hinted/ referenced: for example the \\"coincidental\\" CIA involvement in Guatemala from 1953 to 1990's, or the fact that the democratic government of Jacobo Arbenz had nationalized the US Firm United Fruit Company.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />- Solid book, with a welcome view of the correlation between politics and economics.<br />- Some serious omissions. The book feels scrubbed clean of politically incorrect/ miss-matching data. For example a perfect void for Guatemala's 1954 coup on it's democratic government.<br />- However despite some gaps it is a must read for all interested in economics/ development/ politics.

B002DKGWSO|4.0|I have both the original movie and this version if about the same level only with a few plot twists, mainly the ending they tacked on. Both movies offer a cold blooded feeling when the convict attacks the girls with his gang of fiends in the woods, it really did give me a sickened feeling. This is an exploitation revenge flick just like the original, it's compelling in a cheap shock value way. I gave it an extra star 4, instead of 3 because it's a very vivid HD transfer.

1476712042|4.0|Abby Abernathy is trying to get a fresh start by starting college far away from home in an attempt to escape her troubled past.  She gets off to a good start when her and her best friend move into the dorms at Eastern University.  Things take a turn when she meets the ultimate bad-ass, king of one night stands.  She refuses to my sucked in by his charms and way of life but quickly finds out he has a softer side too.  Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox is a champion underground fighter and everyone at school knows all to well what a loose cannon he can be.  It doesn't stop all the women from falling all over him just to get a few hours alone with him.  Travis is immediately drawn to Abby and the fact that she seems resistant to his charms.  With one lost bet, however, Abby is required to move in with him for one month.  Will that be enough time for Travis to convince her that she means more to him than a one night stand?      The story between Travis and Abby was certainly an emotional rollercoaster ride.  If Travis is the king of one night stands then Abby must be the queen of holding out.  There's a ton of sexual tension between these two to the point that I just wanted to shake some sense into Abby.  I get that Travis is quite flawed but come on, she knows she likes him so I wish she would just stop torturing him.  Abby seems like the typical angst ridden teenage girl which gets a bit tedious after a while, but certainly didn't stop me from enjoying the book.  I can't even place my finger on exactly why I liked this book so much but it was one of those that I just couldn't put down.  I stayed up late and could barely drag myself away from my book to go to work.  There are so many ups and downs that I think I felt about every emotion throughout this book.  Abby comes to learn that not only is Travis the tattoo covered fighter/biker but he's also a straight A student.  There's was definitely a lot going on below the surface with him and I enjoyed getting to know the real Travis and Abby as the story progressed.  A couple of the names where hard for me to get over, I mean come on... America, Brazil, Finch?!  There's one area that felt a little out of place and that was the initial trip they take.  I can't really say why without giving anything away but it just felt a little forced to me, like the author was trying to add more suspense to the story when it didn't really need it.  I did love that the author managed to make sure that Travis always treated Abby with respect even with his bad reputation.  A lot of times the bad boys in these stories treat the women like jerks but then realize they love them and turn it all around.  Short of a couple small things, he always put her on a pedestal and looked out for her best interest.  Travis and Abby's story is wrapped up in this book but there are plans to have a book out in April 2013 from Travis' point of view called \\"Walking Disaster\\" and then another with a story of one of Travis' brothers.  This is a definite recommended read if you don't mind a little teen angst.    [...]
B007XIO9TU|5.0|This is \\"The Master\\" blowing away our friends in Japan with a superb show at the Zepp Music Hall in Tokyo. Johnny is playing better than ever with the back up of a super band. By the third song, he is up to full speed and making for air guitar stuff. The entire show is just great. Five star performance and outstanding production and quality.<br />You can really see that he is loving this show. Mojo will have you stunned and Johnny b. Goode is as good as ever. And just when you thought you might relax, he comes back with the firebird and just rocks out the place. Buy it, love it. Just doesn't get any better.<br />\\"I love to play and I'll keep playin' 'till I'm Dead. And then maybe more!\\"
B0084IG8TM|2.0|I finally saw this movie on DVD, I never got a chance to see it in the theatre and I am so glad I did not. Every so often you get a movie that is big hit and has great overall reviews and I can't understand why, this film is one of them. It had a weak plot, it could have been a TV movie. Also, when movie ends and the heros win the &#34;hunger games&#34; nothing happens like an attempt to over throw the evil goverment that is forcing these kids to enter this cruel games.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|I had tried to find this movie shortly after seeing advertising for it after it showed in theaters. I was sick while it was appearing in theaters so was not able to see it in theaters. I was doing searches for vampire movies and year it came out finally finding it. Glad I bought it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music never gets old. I particularly love watching it around the holidays. I love the music!  :)
B007D2XSW0|5.0|A very clean interface that stands out in the field of photo editing apps. App is stable on my Transformer Prime. Love the fact that it supports landscape orientation for working with my docking station, unlike other apps. Developer is responsive to feedback, a huge plus with the deluge of abandoned apps out there. Recommended.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|ireally like this app it use full every time im on my devic...i have only one word to say great
0425263908|5.0|Great book!  I loved Fifty Shades of Grey and wanted something similar...this book was very similar except there was no S&M, plenty of sex just no extra kinky stuff which was fine with me.  If you liked the romance and sexual yearning of Fifty Shades then you will definitely love this book!
030758836X|3.0|I enjoyed the read, but found everything unbelievable.  The mystery unravelled slowly, then took a dark, twisted turn and then went all over the place.  The ending left me unsatisfied and confused.  I think it was written to be a great page turner, but a lot of true character development was sacrificed in the process. Especially at the end.  But, I did find it intriguing and definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys a thriller.  I just thought the story could've offered more.  It had so much potential and the writer is so talented.
B00000J0O2|5.0|Cartridge was exactly as stated and in perfect working order very fast shipment I love merchants that take pride in their business
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good for short bursts of fun. ive only unlocked 20 games or so but there is some good variety composed of mostly familiar concepts from some others games
B006OGMEUI|5.0|This is my favorite CD of all time. I thought nothing would surpass Slania by Eluveitie, but this one has, in my book. The fact that it is a concept album about the rise and fall of the Gauls makes it that much more cohesive and fascinating. This is not an album that you skip past certain songs. It is a whole story and experience that needs to be taken in. Amazing work by a fantastic band.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have had trouble falling asleep for some time because of outside noise.  No more!!  This app is the perfect solution allowing me to focus my brain on a pleasant sound and sleep in peace.  I love, love, love it!
1891252089|5.0|As an aspiring yoga teacher I love this book. Don't rely on this book alone to learn ashtanga, a great supplement for someone already practicing in a studio on a regular basis.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this weather app has it all. I like the map feature that allows me to see the whole country without having to change my location. I use this app daily.
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is a terrific storyteller, even though he writes non-fiction. Outliers blew me away (as is usual with ALL of Mr. Gladwell's writing) and it gave me much to consider whenever I feel inclined to whine about some famous person's \\"lucky break\\"...! Outliers shows that success is only about 1 part lucky break, mixed with 9 parts sheer, gut-wrenching work. Just a fascinating piece of work.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is Great! Very Fun. Anyone who says its not is Lying. I play it everyday. Its much better on my ki doe than on my iPod.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I love this game!  Yes. It's pretty much a simplified version of starcraft, but excellently balanced. I highly recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Always have loved this game and still do. The display is great and is a good time killer when you are stuck in line somewhere or just need something to do for fun. I recommend this app.
1609611543|5.0|Delivery was as stated online.  The book is amazing and informative.  Makes you realize you are what you eat. If you feel with age you have slowed down check into your diet and realize you can feel great despite the years you have lived. If finishing a meal makes you ready for a nap you are eating wrong.<br />Food is fuel for more energy.  I leaned a lot and am looking forward the the cookbook due out in December.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I didn't get its at first, I over came the challenge. Now I just want more.<br /><br />In an attempt to describe the game all I can say its sort of like sudoku.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|THIS is how you stay fresh, relevent, and a player in the rock world when your ready to collect social security!

B004UID2LC|2.0|i had it for a while. but when i finally used it... my kindle kept acting up and finally started being normal when i deleted it.
B00884GR0W|4.0|After I kill a monster, it spawns in the same area a second later which is annoying. What's the point of killing it if it's not gonna go away? And aren't the monsters only supposed to come out at night? I don't understand how they get inside my house without breaking anything either. I like the game don't get me wrong but I think the creaters rushed it and if they took more time it could have been way better. Also they should update the craftbox with a more wide variety of blocks you can build. You should buy this game if the price is like $3 or less. But if the things I mentioned are updated then it could be worth even $7 or more. Lastly please make it easier to find farm animals. Everything else is good. Somewhat cool game overall.
