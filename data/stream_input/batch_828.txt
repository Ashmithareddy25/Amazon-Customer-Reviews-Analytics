B001KQKC0Q|5.0|I usually don't buy cd's just individual songs but with Nickelback I buy the cd.  I've never been disappointed, I think its an awesome cd and well worth the money.
0452289963|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read that really helps me to understand the world around me and ultimately myself.  I keep it handy to refer to on a regular basis, though I confess I have been back-sliding the past few weeks and the anxiety is returning.  The real gift of this book is that it puts everything in perspective.  That relieves the anxiousness that so seems to pervade our world which leads to wrong perceptions, violence, stupidity, etc.  I have given the book as gifts to 3 people so far.  Thank you
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I'm really tired of some people trying to defend this film as some sort of demented artistic statement about political dominance and moral depravity.  There's nothing artistic about this at all.  What this is is a film by an obviously mentally disturbed director (Pier Pasolini) who wanted to take out his inner anger about being oppressed for being homosexual, and he wanted to take it out on the general public at large.  What can possibly be artistic about a film which shows a table full of adults and children eating human feces, vivid scalpings, genital burnings, continuous sodomy, organ mutilations, and teen children being lead around naked on leashes and forced to bark and eat scraps of food from a dog dish ???  THIS is supposed to be art ???  Salo is nothing but pure evil.  No other film is as brutally, vividly disturbing as this one.  But that does NOT make it a work of art.  Quite the opposite.  It is the type of film that can make you be ashamed to be part of the human race.  If you suffer from depression or are under any sort of treatment to overcome post-traumatic stress, I strongly urge you - DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM !!!  It will only make your condition worse.  I know the film's reputation for being the sickest, most disturbing film ever will make you curious - as it did me - but trust me, if you watch it, you will wish you never had.  I know I wish I never did. The images, once seen, are difficult to clear from one's mind (and they never completely do).       I've never advocated censorship at all, but Salo changes my mind - particularly since it involves cruelty to minors.  If the director Pasolini, as some rumors suggest, was murdered as a reaction to making this film, it is not hard to believe.  This is celluloid at its worst.  Every copy on the market should be deleted and destroyed.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|Excellent watch and extremely attractive.  It is practically as thin as the band, and overall sleek and sophisticated.  The blue face is spectacular, particularly if you like blue.  The pictures really do not do it justice.  It is also very light and comfortable to wear.  Really catches peoples attention; I get many compliments and inquiries as to where I bought it.    The band is really easy once you figure it out, but there is a few minutes of confusion when you first get it.  The watch holds up well so far, and I abuse my watches pretty well.
1550379151|5.0|My 2 year old daughter and I LOVE this book. What a strong, capable, female character that doesn't stand for being treated poorly. I can't wait to buy the anniversary edition!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Even if I didn't know David Cook from American Idol, I would have no doubts about purchasing this album.  This is the album I expected from him and I'm not disappointed.  It is a good rock album.  It fits right into my play list with the likes of Daughtry, Three Days Grace, and so forth.  I have no qualms about recommending this album to anybody.  I know I'll be getting it for a few people for Christmas.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Fun, engaging, movie with good acting by all cast members. Nice special effects and good storyline. The length of the movie was perfect... Not too long nor too short.     This movie isn't just geared for kids either, but also great for adults too. I am glad that both adults and kids may enjoy watching this film.
B001CQONKY|5.0|[[ASIN:B001CQONKY CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - The Eighth Season]] On first viewing, I was somewhat disappointed in CSI 8th Season. It struck me as grim and confusing. Also, I wasn't prepared for the spoofs it includes, and I had to adjust my attitude in order to enjoy them. The first Season-8 episode focuses on the \\"miniature killer\\" Natalie and on Sarah, trapped under the car. I was disappointed that the focus of the much-anticipated episode shifted so completely away from Natalie. But then, I'm fascinated by serial killers. I also found it difficult to see a couple of the team members go through extremely stressful situations. But, once I adjusted to the plots, I found my enjoyment restored. In sum, I'd say that the season is a good mix of the dire and the delightful. I'm still one of their more devoted fans.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is one of those albums that you enjoy from beginning to end. Just great!
B001GQACGO|3.0|Yes, I listen to the radio all the time while i'm in my car even though they play the same songs over and over and over and over again.    For some reason, though I like \\"If I were a Boy\\" better than Single Ladies. (And I am a boy)    I also like the Sasha Fierce part of the album better than the I am part.    I don't know if that helps but I think I would have prefered if it were one CD with the tracks more blended together.     I probably would have enjoyed the album more if I were a girl.    Oh well.
B0018S6YOE|4.0|I have to give Rihanna credit. I'm not a big fan of hers in general but the is a fun pop record. Almost every song makes me wanna dance. I'm glad she stepped away from \\"trying\\" to do ballads because she can't pull them off. But she can definitely put out a club hit.
B00000JNNY|1.0|I order this disc twice...both were listed as new. The first disc would not track properly in my auto CD player. Returned the first and recieved the replacment...same problem with first. Will not track properly in the car CD player. I burnt the disc onto a generic CD-R and it works fine. I've been told that occasionally music labels will use less than quality material and have results similar to mine. too bad considering the cost of quality CD's today. No reason to cut corners.

B000I0QK74|2.0|I'm a James Taylor fan, and a Christmas music fan, so I thought this would be a terrific buy.  And it just wasn't.<br /><br />This is first and foremost a James Taylor record.  The Christmas part places a distant second, as the arrangements are mostly non-traditional.  His voice is clean and clear as ever, but Christmas is a really fun holiday, and there seems to be no fun in his singing.<br /><br />I've never heard \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" (where he duets with Natalie Cole) where the couple sounds completely mismatched, as it does here.  They both sang their parts well, but it just didn't seem plausible that they were a couple.  Natalie sounds bright and cheery, and James sounds like a nerdy goober.<br /><br />Other songs (Jingle Bells, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Winter Wonderland) are paced so slowly that I just can't wait for them to end.  How can you screw up Jingle Bells?!<br /><br />That said, there are some good tracks on here, too.  The Christmas Song, Some Children See Him, Who Comes This Night. . .but it's just not enough.<br /><br />He just drags down the pace, and kills the excitement of the holiday.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This album has been worth the wait and shows that David Cook's songwriting talent mirrors his one of a kind voice! Every song is incredible and truly shows the world why he deserved to win AI.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|This is an excellent album for the winter season. Loreena McKennitt's voice is simply angelic and her renditions of classic holiday songs such as \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\\" \\"Coventry Carol\\" and \\"Emmanuel\\" are absolutely beautiful. Similar to Nox Arcana's [[ASIN:B000ALIUR4 Winter's Knight]], which coincidentally contains the same traditional songs, the original songs blend very nicely with the holiday tracks, making the entire album a dose of winter magic.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith's Horses is a brutal and bloody masterwork of American punk rock.      I am a little surprised to see that this album has only been reviewed 64 times, while most of the artists that I consider to be Smith's sonic neighbors---Velvet Underground, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Nirvana, Van Morrison etc.---have many hundreds of reviews.  Maybe this is because the soundstyle of Horses is hard to classify: its too much punk to be considered psychedelic rock, and its too psychedelic to be called  punk.  Horses seems too well-planned to be garage rock, but at the same time its too primitive to be called art rock.  Come to think of it, the music is a lot like the album cover: androgynous.  It's kind-of weird for me to say this, but at times I've found myself quite unable to connect with this album, skipped through every song, and then threw it down on the floor in disgust.  Other times I've been truly inspired by the album, and have listened to it over and over again on repeat.    Finally, I must say that I agree with the numerous others who have pointed out the uselessness of the My Generation bonus track---it completely disrupts the flow of the album.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Fans of Enya will definitely want to add this cd to their Christmas wish list. The album creates a mental image of a dreamy Gaelic wonderland covered in ivory snow. Enya's ethereal vocals sound heavenly on her renditions of classic holiday songs such as \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\" and other traditional songs. Not as satisfying as Loreena Mckennitt's Christmas album or Nox Arcana's [[ASIN:B000ALIUR4 Winter's Knight]], this cd offers a peaceful journey into a magical winter realm.
B000FC10MU|4.0|This is a good book.  Enjoyed the plot and storyline.  Very imaginative and thought provoking.
B001GZ6QBU|2.0|I realize I'm an outlier in this one, but The Dark Knight was easily the most overrated movie I've seen in years. There are so many great ideas stuffed into the picture but the film never comes together. In this case, the whole really is less than the sum of its parts.     The grim, realistic portrayal of the Batman mythos is an interesting idea; I'm just not sure it works. Even in the comics, Batman was always somewhat larger than life, like a pulp fiction character. By treating Batman like an actual person, Nolan invites the audience to question all of the implausibilities in the story. And there are many.     For example, at one point the Joker kidnaps two key characters, but the kidnapping occurs entirely off-screen - we're just told the Joker has them and left to wonder how that happened. Batman also uses cell phones to spy on all of Gotham City; this is just not possible. The Joker's henchmen are supposedly insane, but they manage to pull off several daring heists. Then the Joker kills them, which seems like it would discourage new recruits. You get the idea.     If Nolan treated the material like a comic book, none of this illogic would matter. But, he treats the entire movie like a realistic crime drama ... until it's inconvenient, then he glosses over major plot points with comic book logic. I guess my big problem is that Nolan wants to have it both ways. The Dark Knight is gritty and realistic at times, but also expects us the audience to overlook some huge inconsistencies and major plotholes. It just didn't work for me.     The whole tone of the movie is so dark and grim it started to become oppressive after awhile. I was never a fan of the Adam West style campy Batman, but even in the darker comics the character at least had a sense of wry humor. Not in this film. Heath Ledger makes a great Joker but the whole conception of the character is off. Unlike say Alan Moore's \\"The Killing Joke,\\" the Joker in this movie is insane and dangerous, but not particularly charismatic or funny or even all that witty. He's just a sociopath. I've seen it in other movies, it's not fresh.     The film is also at leats 30 minutes overlong and Nolan still has no idea how to film an action sequence. It's bad enough he made a movie about a vigilante detective who does no actual detective work. What's worse, Nolan made a movie about a crimefighter who's basically a martial arts, but he can't shoot an action seqeuence to save his life. To cover up this glaring deficiency, Nolan shoots most of the action scenes in this sloppy, quick edit style that's more disorienting than thrilling.     The acting is uniformly good and there are so many great ideas floating around. The Joker is clearly a metaphor for terrorism here - a destructive force that can't be reasoned with or appeased. The movie touches on ideas like the value of torture, rendition, wire-tapping, etc. when confronted with this kind of enemy. Nolan obviously has a vision - he just doesn't have the right story.     2 1/2 stars.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|David Cook's debut album is well worth the wait. For those who watched him on American Idol, this album is EXACTLY what you would expect. For the most part, David sticks to his strengths of rock ballads. \\"Lie\\", \\"I Did It For You\\" and \\"Permanent\\" are absolutely amazing rock ballads! If you liked David Cook on American Idol, this CD is a MUST HAVE!
0375703861|4.0|I struggled with \\"White Teeth\\" when I first opened the book shortly after its publication several years back. I liked parts, didn't like others. The book seemed too loose for me, it roamed around, bouncing from scene to scene, character to character. I laughed at some of the scenes, but struggled to keep turning the pages. Now when I go back to the book, I'm simply amazed to find that it's incredibly coherent, the story woven artfully together, cohesive, tasty in its comic flare, just plain delightful. It's not the England I really know, yet I'm sure it's the England that really is. As a writer, Smith is great to read, and \\"White Teeth\\" must stand as the very best of her work. In looking at her subsequent novels, I don't find the same kind of exhilaration, the same energy as in \\"White Teeth,\\" but that's OK. She's done it so well here that all is forgiven. \\"White Teeth\\" is one for the ages.<br /><br />-Tom Maremaa, Author of the Forthcoming [[ASIN:1601641702 Metal Heads: A Novel]] from Kunati Books in Spring 2009
B000U1ZV3U|3.0|This movie is more a biography of Wyatt Earp than a simple retelling of the OK Corral shootout story.  It starts with the lead-in to the OK Corral, then flashes back to Wyatt as a young boy planning to run away to fight in the civil war with his two older brothers.  It shows Wyatt as taking over leadership of the Earp brothers and as a frustrated businessman along with the many things Wyatt did to end up a lawman-gunfighter.  The defining event in his life in the movie is the loss of his wife, which colors all of his subsequent actions from mugging a man to stealing a horse to hunting buffalo, etc.  Dennis Quaid is outstanding as Doc Holliday as is Kevin Costner as Wyatt Earp. I would have given this 4 and a half stars had it been edited down to about two hours and forty-five minutes.  It is too long.  Lots of very good actors and a big story though.
B0015HZAK2|5.0|This Album came out when I was in High School. I remember hearing it for the 1st time & just being amazed about how Awesome U2 sounded live. This Album has so much energy. I listened to it constantly. I wore out the cassette & had to buy it when it came out on CD. A lot of good memories come back to me from 25 yrs ago. It reminds me of being young. This album has to be one of the greatest recorded live performances of all time. I saw U2 for the 1st time in March 1985 at UIC Pavilion in Chicago & they were outstanding. It lived up to the Hype. They are still a good band, but not a great one like they were in the 80's & 90's.
0143113100|5.0|This has to be one of the most fascinated works I've come across in a while.<br />The main premise of the book is the extraordinary plasticity of the human brain. The author makes a compelling argument, supported by endless and very valuable examples, studies and facts to support this theory.<br /><br />Some of the most exciting topics explore how the brain develops and learns, effects of certain disorders (i.e. obsessive-compulsive disorder), addictions and strokes on its function and current treatments that reverse these effects.<br /><br />The author gives several recommendations for programs that can help young and aging brains stay alert and agile by following the latest research and applied scientific discoveries. The final parts of the book discuss how vision and culture's profound implications on the brain's neuroplasticity.<br /><br />I highly recommended this book for all readers who may be remotely curious about the human physiology.
B0007XCMQA|5.0|This CD literally lights up my speakers and/or headphones when I play it. The Rawness of the U2 War Album & the Clarity of the Original Master Recording make this a must own CD.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This album proves that he is worthy of the title of \\"American Idol 2008\\" this album is greater than I expected...I am truly impressed with his debut.  \\"Kiss On The Neck\\" is awesome \\"bar-ba-sol\\" is rock awesome!

B000000OQF|5.0|This is one of the greatest debut albums in the history of rock and roll, and 20 years or so after it was released, it's still one of the greatest albums ever.  Despite Guns n Roses being a metal band from the late 1980's, they transcend genre and make lasting music.  None of their albums have dated, and it all started with this masterpiece.<br /><br />All the classic songs are here, the real rock and roll anthems (Paradise City, Welcome to the Jungle, and Sweet Child of Mine), and they are really true classics in every sense of the word.  They still rock, still seem dangerous, and no matter how many times you spin this album/CD, you won't get tired of it.  Sure, the original band is gone and Guns n Roses consists of Axl Rose and new members, but this album reminds you of how awesome they were, how they really shook up the rock world with this album, and how Appetite for Destruction still has its power all these years later.  It's pretty cool when you listen to an album that you can listen to many years later, and feel the exact same way without giving into nostalgia.  The followups to this album are great, too, but here is where the powderkeg started.  Guns n Roses rule!
0393324818|5.0|[[ASIN:0832950165 Pain Killer Marketing: How to Turn Customer Pain into Market Gain]]<br /><br />This baseball book does a great job of asking and answering the question: What are the hidden benefits and values that others do not see? The book explains why decisions should be based upon predictive metrics, not emotion. This is the same message from our book about business. Great stories and enough explanation to relate the lessons from each story to a business situation. A great read!
B0000026TD|5.0|I thought I was the only one, but after reading some of the other reviews on here I am convinced there is something special about this album that possibly taps into a collective memory or some deep Carl Jung - like principle here!  I first heard the music of Vollenweider when I was probably 10. My uncle had bought me a walkman in 1993 for Christmas and as was the tradition back then, the whole family would go camping for 3 weeks over the summer (Christmas is during summer in New Zealand) at a place called \\"Kai Iwi Lakes\\" (Deep blue fresh water lakes with white sandy beaches surrounded by a pine forest). It was always blue skies and starry nights. Needless to say the only tape I had access to on that particular trip (amongst a few others) was a tape of my father's with `Down to the Moon' on one side and `Dancing with the Lion' on the other. I remember looking out the tent window at a vibrant milky way at night and having some pretty awesome moments with that music as the soundtrack. Every time I listen to it I am taken back to that place and time, and make an effort to fire it up whenever I am camping.  You might say I grew up on his music (although my mates could never understand it!). It is truly inspiring and I can fully endorse and relate to the other positive comments here on Amazon. This music will take you places I sware. You will not find a more rich and vibrant musical tapestry of sounds, colours and textures. And the harp....what a sound!
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|I don't know what all of the complaining is about. This album is great, and I love every song.

0066214122|1.0|Well here it is 2008 and I bought this to read while on a flight to Cancun to work.  The plot is basically terrible, the first part of the book reads like a General Hospital episode.  The part of super manager fails unbelievably.  Worse, I already had a better way to destroy the supposed villain at half the book's length than the ending. AVOID THIS BOOK!  Anyone that has seen the movie, (yeah, I know I'm using a movie reference here) The Matrix knows that EMP will kill any computer type device unless it is hardened to MILSPEC (I'm thinking that Dude missed this movie....).  So to kill nano machines that use electrical circuits? EMP! DUH! This book is dull and boring and not worth the cash I paid for it.
6305161879|5.0|I've loved this movie for years.  It always cheers me up.  Kevin Kline  won a best supporting oscar for this movie.

0316035904|5.0|One of my favorite Sedaris collections. It has some new stories as well as some old that I have read elsewhere. Great stocking stuffer for a Sedaris fan. All the stories are hilarious - especially \\"Santaland Diaries.\\" Sedaris has a gift for humor that shines throughout this book.
B001GQACGO|3.0|Ok, I have had the chance to listen to this CD(s) for the last 2 weeks (and I still bought it) and I have to say for the most part I like the CD(s). Let's get a major grip out of the way though:  This CD could have been reduced to 1 CD with interludes to separate the Beyoncé/Sasha Fierce personas by eliminating immature songs such as \\"Diva\\" and \\"Video Phone\\" (and possibly \\"Single Ladies\\" because it's a retread of \\"Get me body\\" which I hated until I saw the video; same goes for this song. That video for \\"Single Ladies\\" makes a brotha stand at attention..lol). Also, why put some of the stronger tracks for the Sasha Fierce on the Deluxe CD? For those people who will buy the standard edition of the CD, you will be cheated out of the mid-tempo R&B swagger of \\"Ego\\", the Jerry Maguire inspired \\"Hello\\" and the euro-pop/house inspired \\"Scared of Lonely\\" (I can't wait for the remix of this gem...I can heard the hand claps now). The rest of the tracks on the standard edition (with the exception of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" another future club track) of \\"Sasha Fierce\\" CD could have been cut. If you buy the standard edition though, the best CD is the \\"I am...\\" CD. \\"If I was boy\\" is one of Beyoncé's best songs to date next to \\"Crazy in Love\\", \\"Irreplaceable\\", and \\"Me, Myself, and I\\". The emotions and subtleties she brings to this song are remarkable for a singer who at times has a habit of over singing a song (I love the crack by one reviewer about Beyoncé singing to a level that can be heard in a three mile radius..LOL). She follows up the latter song with \\"Halo\\" which showcase all of these emotions at full blast. Other highlights are the Babyface penned \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\", \\"Ave Maria\\" (not a remake but an interpretation), and the bonus tracks of \\"Smash into U\\" and \\"That's why you're beautiful.\\"  The \\"I am...\\" CD is basically a pop CD but with some real raw emotions. I was pleasantly surprise in liking the \\"I am...\\" CD. I hope one day Beyoncé will give her fans a strong R&B centeredCD that does not try to cater to the trends in today's music.  She has the talent to do it.  Rating - 3 ½ ***
0316776963|5.0|This is Sedaris' best collection of short stories/memoirs/autobiographies. His writing is wonderful, in part because it's hard to separate fact from fiction. He has a true gift for writing. My favorite story is the title one but all are great. These stories are great to read all at once or one at a time!
B001H5X7I4|4.0|What year is this? How many DvDs have we come to expect with bloopers & gag reels? It is now 1:00 am and I find myself feeling a bit let down after watching this movie and seeing that on the two-disc set there are NO GAG REELS or BLOOPERS! OMFG! Okay. I hate to say it, but really, maybe there should have only been a single or two-disc set released. Not both though. I really love Stiller and he has done a great job and it was really cool to watch the extras but I felt like there was something missing by not having any gag reels or bloopers. Now we KNOW they had those, they just must have forgotten to put them on the discs... OH though, the Viral MTV movie they made will leave you in stitches. I never saw it until now and omg! Oh and of course, the PSA on retards is pretty funny too since you know that they only made that up to make up for making fun of retards in the movie. LMAO! But still I really wish we could have seen bloopers or a gag reel... :(
B0014DZ2VO|2.0|There are James Bond fans, and there are Daniel-Craig-as-James-Bond fans.  Disclaimer to the former: I am the latter.  The pre-Daniel-Craig films amuse me somewhat but aren't the type of film I would choose to watch repeatedly.  But I own Casino Royale; it achieves a perfect balance between Bond's arrogant charm and carelessness, and a hidden solemnity and vulnerability.<br /><br />On a character level, fans of Daniel Craig's interpretation as well as fans of the earlier films will be disappointed in Quantum of Solace.  The writers take James Bond so far to the dark side this time that he hardly resembles himself.  At times, he could be any other action hero wallowing in a recent Dark Event.  The arrogance, the charm, the carelessness have all but evaporated.<br /><br />Based on the final scene, the writers may be taking Bond through a slow evolution over three or more movies, and Quantum of Solace is Bond at his darkest, when he's still clinging to revenge for Vesper.  Maybe the glaringly missing line, \\"Bond, James Bond,\\" is missing for a reason: the essence of Bond is lost in this film, submerged.  In the next, hopefully his \\"bloody cheek\\" and hubris will regain its balance with his dark and driven side.  Otherwise, James Bond could become just another boring, brooding action hero.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Sometimes leans a little too much toward the \\"dancy\\" (synth-rock) stuff, but overall a solid effort.  The rock songs really do ROCK, and it's a fairly good listen all the way through.

0142000655|5.0|My daughter sent this one to me, appalled that I'd never read it. I send her Evanovich, she sends me Steinbeck. If I were an astute kind of person, that might explain some things. Good thing I'm not astute.     I've been putting off writing something about this. I think I'm a little intimidated because it's A Classic.    What the heck. The point is just to say if I liked the book and why or why not. Zillions of people have reviewed and analyzed and dissected this book, and there's really no reason for me to do that. Whew.    So, on the off chance that I'm not the only cultural illiterate out there, East of Eden is the story of the Salinas Valley of California, and about two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks.    I had a little trouble following the connections between people at first, but it became clear later on. The Hamiltons are Steinbeck's family--in fact, he's in the second part of the story himself as a child, and my guess is they're there to make the story personal, and to contrast with the Trasks and provide a nudge to them once in a while.    Mostly, it's the story of two generations of brothers: Charles and Adam Trask, and Caleb and Aron Trask. Adam was his father's favorite, which caused a lot of problems between the brothers. He later marries and his wife gives birth to twins: Caleb and Aron, and the pattern threatens to repeat itself.    There's a bit of heavy-handed Cain and Abel imagery there, even down to the names, but the characters are so convincingly realistic that it never interfered with the story, and indeed was only apparent when I put the book down for a while. What I really enjoyed was the struggle between Caleb and Aron, trying not to repeat the pattern, and the realization that everything wasn't exactly as it seemed from the outside or on the surface.

Mary Jane's show closes after one performance. Peter's former friend Harry Osborne is out for revenge, as the New Goblin, influenced by his father's spirit. The Bugle has a new photographer who's out for Peter's job, and who has a great success plan: prove Spider-Man is a bad guy. An alien symbiote bonds Peter to his suit, turning it black, amplifying his powers, and changing his personality. One of Peter's classmates, Gwen, is getting his attention and driving a wedge between him and Mary Jane. And as if that's not enough, Uncle Ben's real killer, who's only stealing money for his little girl, gets changed into the Sandman, a creature made of (what else?) sand. Oh, yes. Peter gets away from the symbiote, but it attaches to the ambitious photographer, who enjoys the power and becomes Venom.    Did I leave anything out?    That's really the whole/only problem I had with Spider-Man 3--it was just way too busy. Even at almost 2.5 hours, it still felt too rushed. Plenty of people have written opinions of which parts should have been cut or left out, but I'm not that picky--just get rid of one of the villains and one of the personal-life problems, and I'd be a happy camper.    Other than that, it was a fun movie, and pretty much what I expected. Lots of web-swinging and action, plenty of emotional depth and consequences, and really cool special effects. The Sandman in particular had impressive effects--in fact, if it weren't for those effects and the difficulty Spidey had in fighting a creature who can re-form itself, I'd have said the movie could have done without that story line.    One thing I do want to mention, because I saw a few reviews criticizing this: when Spidey is influenced by the symbiote, he becomes all arrogant, reminding me of Jerry Lewis in The Nutty Professor. But what I just loved (and this is apparently not a majority opinion) is that, unlike Buddy Love, Peter Parker's alter-ego is not irresistible to women. He's still just as inept and clumsy, and the arrogance does not endear him to people. I thought it was a nice bit of characterization, actually--the symbiote merely amplifying traits (like the suit's power) rather than actually changing those traits.
B001EO2UKO|2.0|5 years was a long time so those waiting for this album might have gotten something they weren't quite looking for.  The songs are pretty, smooth, but unfortunately kind of bland and boring by albums end. It's like waiting for a hook or tempo change that never quite comes.  A song should have a place where it picks up the beat, the emotion, and become a little catchy!  Sheryl Crow has become exactly the same way with her last two CDs (both poor sellers).  You have to have something catchy to catch people's attention or to snap your fingers to a little bit.  But this album is a sleeper, it never picks up!  Didos first two CDs had similar tone in places, but there was MORE!  Songs like No Angel and White Flag were catchy and pleasant to listen to again and again! Example White Flag starts similar than hits the high note at:  I will go down with this ship........  It's the glue that bonds the song together, up tempo and than back to slower.  But Safe Trip Home runs together and never changes.  There's hardly a place where the key changes!  I listened to it several times and now I don't want to hear it anymore! The sad thing is this could effectively end Dido's career.  After a 5 year hiatus, now hard telling how long the next release will come?  Alternative careers can end SO QUICKLY! I won't give examples, but the list is LONG!  Than for some reason all interest seems to get lost in the artist, and even the label doesn't seem to care much anymore about promoting them.  It's the one mistake, your out mentality (which is a shame).  Part of the reason could be the long gap between CDs in today's age.  Use to be every year an artist was expected to put out an album.  So if they made a dud, they could already start working on the next one.  I think Dido should do so now, get back to the studio, work on some good songs, and make something a little livelier next time (a little catchy) or at least some ballads that pick up the pace at least a little!
1592402038|5.0|If you've been living in a cave, the subtitle explains what Eats, Shoots and Leaves is about: \\"The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation.\\" Since I'm a bit of a grammar geek (albeit an imperfect and occasionally lazy one), I absolutely loved it.    There wasn't much that was news to me. Ones vs. one's was helpful, though I understand that's controversial. I spent far too much time one day googling to chase down which was correct. For the most part, I vastly prefer the practicality of the British usage of such things as putting punctuation inside or outside quotation marks depending on where it makes sense and whether to add an extra S when forming the possessive of words ending in S:  British:  When did John say \\"stop\\"?    U.S.:  When did John say \\"stop?\\"  British: Thomas's   U.S.: Thomas'    I do, however, much prefer the logic of the terminal comma in a list, since it makes it clear whether or not the last two items are separate or a pair.    More entertaining than the facts, however, was the humor. I laughed every couple of pages, and read so many excerpts aloud that my 12-year-old picked it up to read as soon as I'd finished it.    The bottom line here, though, is that this is a very subjective book. If you're the kind of person who knows the difference between there, they're, and their, cringes at new car's and truck's, and daydreams about taking a Sharpie to the 10 items or less sign, you'll probably love this. If that sounds obsessive to you, and like I should get a life, you'll probably hate it.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I need to say first - I really am not a fangirly type. However, while I was recovering from a serious illness this past late winter and spring, I caught both David Cook and David A on American Idol - a show I'd never, EVER watched. I admit, I originally rooted for David A .. until I heard David Cook sing his updated grungier (Seattle-fied!) version of Lionel Ritchie's \\"Hello\\". I. WAS. HOOKED. Every Tuesday and Wednesday night from that point forward, I looked forward so much, after a day of grueling physical therapy, to watching David Cook perform!  I actually bawled like a baby in public when it was announced that David Cook was the winner of American Idol 2008!<br /><br />I even went to an American Idol concert here locally when they toured in the summer. David Cook did NOT disappoint .. no how, no way.<br /><br />So, here I am, many many months later, nearly fully recovered, and I have been listening to this whole album non-stop - at work, in the car, at home, in my iPod, on websites, wherever I am, so is David Cook.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Nickelback, Daughtry, and of course, being from Seattle, the whole Seattle Grunge thang. So it comes as no surprise that the ever excellent Mr. David Cook has captured my full ear.<br /><br />Of the songs on his post-AI debut here (I call this his second solo album, after his self-produced \\"Analog Heart\\"), the ones that completely rock for me are:<br /><br />Declaration<br />Heroes<br />Bar Ba Sol<br />A Kiss on The Neck (hidden at the 12 min mark behind A Daily AntheM)<br /><br />Although I also enjoy the solid, chick soft rockers of:<br />Come Back To Me<br />Mr. Sensitive<br />Avalanche<br />I Did It For You<br />A Daily Anthem<br />and of course,<br />Permanent<br /><br />This being a post AI release, I hope The Time Of My Life (Bonus Track) is his last dive into this type of music. Now, I fully respect Mr. Regie Hamm, the songwriter, but .. it's just not quite David Cook's style. However, he did OWN the song this past summer, and his acoustic live performances of this are incredible!!<br /><br />David Cook is here to stay and he is PERMANENT. His album has been in pre-sales up here at amazon within the top 10 since it was announced in May, so is it any wonder that today, on the release date, it's actually #2 with a bullet??<br /><br />Destined to be a solid favorite for years to come. Encore, David!!!here to stay and he is PERMANENT. His album has been in pre-sales up here at amazon within the top 10 since it was announced in May, so is it any wonder that today, on the release date, it's actually #2 with a bullet??

B00005NRO3|4.0|I purchased this film for use in a Halloween Week Movie Extravaganza.  Adult viewers (20+ y.o.) of all ages found this film entertaining, funny, satirical, and interesting.  Older folks did not like the strong graphic violence but this was off-set by the challenging \\"who is the murderer?\\" puzzle presented in the film.   The casting is excellent.  The actors line up nicely with the stereotypical characters of the story.  The only thing I would change would be to use the alternative scene involving the students talking about the influence of films on behavior conducted by the stereotypical college professor.   The film has a superior soundtrack.   BUY THIS FILM.  It is worthy  of inclusion in your Library.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar,the greatest animation studio around today,produces yet another timeless classic,that could arguably be considered the finest film they have ever produced.    Essentially a loving homage to silent comedy,Wall-E tells the story of a lonely robot who is left to clean up the Earth after an apocalypse.  His only friend is his pet cockroach and the only things that entertain him are the remains of human culture he discovers in film and music.    His monotony is broke by the arrival of a female robot,the very cute,Eva,who has come to earth to collect samples of vegetation for hopes of repopulation.    Wall-E becomes smitten and begins to court her,but when she finds a plant that Wall-E had in his collection of stuff that he's collected,she has to go back to her ship,where all the humans from Earth have gone.  He follows her back and reveals a secret about humanity in the process and himself.    An absolutely beautiful film going experience,with lovely animation,heart felt sentiment and an absolutely timeless message about our planet.  Wall-E is truly an important film,and it's nice to see a romance today that is handled with such sensitivity and LOVE....even if there two robots.  The characters of Wall-E and Eva make for one of the cutest screen couples i've ever seen.    The film is able to effortlessly blend the genres of Comedy,Romance and Science Fiction in one to make for an unforgettable film going experience.    An absolute classic,enjoy this film with someone you love.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about 14 years old (1979), back in the days when movie channels would play the same 2-3 movies over and over.  I fell in love with it then and have been in love with it ever since.  I even won a free ice cream cone at the Ben an Jerry's in Ithaca, NY when (in 2002) I was able to tell them the significance of Maude's tatoo.  I have always told my friends that  Harold and Maude is my favorite movie and that I think the best movie ever made was Life is Beautiful, by Roberto Bergnini.  If you think about it, there are many parallels
031606792X|5.0|At some point, writing reviews of certain bestselling series seems like a superfluous endeavor. When thousands, if not millions, of readers are going to pick up the next installment regardless of its praiseworthiness or potential weaknesses, we reviewers feel even more irrelevant than we do otherwise. Penning reviews of the later Harry Potter books certainly felt like that. Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Saga, a publishing juggernaut soon to be made into a series of feature films, also, I would argue, has landed firmly in this category. I've reviewed all four novels for [...], and I've watched as a series that started out as an unusual debut vampire romance took on a life of its own. So this review is, in all likelihood, completely unnecessary --- but since the review has the potential to live online nearly as long as the immortal Cullen family, here goes.    Bella Swan is ecstatic --- and nervous. She's on the brink of marrying the love of her life, the charismatic, devastatingly handsome vampire Edward Cullen. Bella's parents have reluctantly come around to the idea of their teenaged daughter getting married. And the Cullens, particularly Bella's good friend Alice, who plans the event, couldn't be happier. Only Bella's old pal Jacob is upset at losing Bella.    The wedding goes off smoothly and beautifully, and Edward and Bella spend a magical honeymoon on a private island. There, they are finally able to indulge the desire they've always felt for each other (even if their lovemaking initially results in injuries both to Bella and their room, thanks to Edward's uncontrollable passion). When Bella begins to be alternately sick and ravenous, she becomes suspicious that --- despite everything she's been told about the impossibility of such a thing --- she might be pregnant with Edward's child. Terrified that she could lose her life to the ravenous, vampiric unborn child inside her, pressured by Edward and others to rid herself of the baby, Bella retreats into herself, concerned only with protecting her unborn child, even if it means harm to herself.    As for Jacob (who narrates the middle part of the novel), he tries in vain to imprint on other females, but he cannot forget Bella, especially when he learns of her perilous pregnancy and physical condition. When Bella and Edward's daughter is born, is it possible that this half-human, half-vampire can unite the Cullens and Jacob's shape-shifting La Push clan? Could she be the catalyst for Jacob and Edward's reconciliation? Or does her very existence --- particularly once word of her birth reaches the dangerous Voltari vampire clan --- put everything Bella loves at risk?    It was perhaps inevitable that Stephenie Meyer would disappoint some with this final installment. Readers --- who have lined up for hours for author appearances, pushed the series onto bestseller lists, and created thriving online communities devoted to the book --- obviously take the novels, and these characters, seriously indeed. Certain elements of BREAKING DAWN are perplexing, even off-putting --- particularly the scenes of sex, pregnancy and childbirth.    But it's nearly impossible to please everyone --- especially when so much of the series' drama has relied on the tension of Bella's choice between two very different but desirable lovers. Readers who are able, eventually, to gain some perspective will find much to redeem BREAKING DAWN, particularly its new insights into Jacob's inner life as well as its neat resolution to several of the series' pressing conflicts and its realistic (or at least as realistic as a vampire romance can get) portrayal of the complexities and joys of married life.    Meyer's legions of fans are likely to debate, discuss and dissect BREAKING DAWN for months to come --- at least until the film version of TWILIGHT comes out on November 21st, when they'll have a whole new set of creative decisions to consider and critique.         --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl
B00003CX8N|5.0|This was one of my favorite films.  It was very nostalgic for booklovers and fans of Anthony Hopkins.  He won't disappoint you.
B001GQSY5U|3.0|OK. Let's face it. MOST people are downing The Clone Wars because it just doesn't live up to the rest of the Star Wars saga. In that respect, the public is 100% correct.    Now, let's take The Clone Wars for what it really is. It is merely a feature-length prelude to the kid-friendly animated TV series on Cartoon Network; nothing more, nothing less. Even George Lucas himself admitted in an interview that the Clone Wars feature film was pretty much \\"an afterthought\\" after he viewed the dailies from the actual TV show.    I, for one, felt that the animation was quite beautiful and pleasing to the eye as far as the backgrounds and layouts were concerned. Yes, the characters did appear to be too rigid and expressionless and everyone's hairstyles appeared to be molded from Play-Dough, but overall, the animation was quite nice; maybe not state-of-the-art, but still quite enjoyable.    Also, it is true that the plot was rather thin, but remember Lucas' target audience for this film and the TV series; kids and pre-teens. My five-year-old loved it and I enjoyed watching it with her. Compared to the actual movies, however, it does leave you kind of flat. Even Genndy Tartakovski's 2004 Clone Wars traditional animated series was vastly superior to this film, but you have to keep in mind the fact that the 2004 series was aimed at a more mature audience (teens and adults IMHO).    Will I watch the series on Cartoon Network? If I'm home and there's nothing else on or nothing else better to do, sure. If not, oh well, no big loss. I won't make it a point to tune in.    So, take this film for what it is; a kid-friendly chapter in the Star Wars prequel saga; just don't expect to experience that same thing that the films offered and you will enjoy it.

B00000I2I7|1.0|Of course, that \\"one star\\" rating couldn't be for the musical quality of this great record which I could easily rate \\"5 stars\\" and probably you are reading this review not to know how good this record is but just to see if this \\"remastered\\" issue is worth. Well, I hope you can learn from my review and other reviews on the web that as surprising as it maybe, this 1998-1999 Sting reissues does not do any justice to the original recordings and somehow they have made it to sound worst. As I love this album I just tought it could be great to hear it in a better version. I read some reviews telling that this album, the Soul Cages and The Dream were ruined by the remastering but couldn't resist from buying this version. Well, I deeply regret it. The sound of this remastering is WEAK, DULL and they have removed almost of low frequencies. It's really a shame. You are better off buying the other versions and NO THIS ONE.
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|The latest in the James Bond 007 series and a sequel to Casino Royale is definitely action packed!<br /><br />This one begins where Casino left off. Bond is out to avenge his late love, Vespa.  As true Bond, the adventure begins and doesn't let up until the end.  It has car chases, footchases, wonderful scenery---everything we expect from a Bond film and more---nice looking people.  I could have done without the \\"quick\\" edit shots, though.  Bond, again, finds himself in trouble with M (Judi Dench).  Those two play so well off each other, I have to admit, better than Pierce Brosnan.<br /><br />I am a lover of all Bond films, and to me this one is far better than Casino Royale.  I thought Casino dragged on in parts, but this one far held my interest.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars.  The movie itself, I believe, it is definite 5 stars and worth owning a copy when it comes out. However, to me, Bond has to be the \\"perfect\\" guy (handsome and debonair) and Daniel Craig, really doesn't do it for me.  He has a great body, but that's where it ends, so I deducted 1 star.
0385339585|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read!  It is a very slow read with characters I could not come to like and/or care about.  I usually enjoy John Grisham novels, so I kept reading in hopes of a twist, a burst of action, an interesting character...anything to turn around the reading experience....but it continued to be a bore the entire way through.  I believe Mr. Grisham put some words to paper just so he could write-off a trip to Brazil, a major setting in the book. I only gave one star because the system forced me to select at least one star.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|It's fresh and it's magical and horrific.  It's the hero's story of a quest.  And it's the story of the city of Mumbai, India, with its vast contrasts of utter poverty in an emerging modern world.  It moves with lightning speed and I found myself smiling one minute and grimacing in disgust in another.  It's an emotional roller coaster ride that left me exhilarated and convinced that this breakthrough film is a true global masterpiece.<br /><br />The film opens as a young Indian man competes on a television quiz show.  He is winning and winning. In the next scene he is being tortured by the police because they think he is cheating as he is not educated and is a child of the slums.  His story is then told in flashbacks, as the audience learns how he came to know the answers to each of the questions.<br /><br />We meet him and his brother as young children living on the street and exploited by gangsters to become street beggars.  However, there is constant humor in juxtaposition to the wince-inducing revulsion which adds a special kind of humanity to the story.  Through all the misfortunes to which the brothers are exposed, there is an upbeat quality to the film, as we come to understand that it was these traumatic incidents in this young man's life that taught him the specific answers to the question being asked on the quiz show.<br /><br />Of course there is also a romance.  Our hero is looking for the young woman he loves, a childhood companion through the horror, who is still being exploited by the Indian underworld, which now includes his brother.<br /><br />All of this is packed in an upbeat and moving story that involved me from the beginning and made me want to stand up and cheer at the happy ending.<br /><br />This is not a film to be missed.  It breaks all the stereotypes and comes across as a groundbreaking fresh new voice in the landscape of the world of film.  I give it my highest recommendation.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Taken in its entirety it is not among DT's very best albums. I own all the DT and LTE studio albums because I am a huge fan, hence the 5 star rating, that's because nobody on this planet compares to the skills these guys have. But just like Octavarium some tracks are outstanding, and few will not be on your mp3s play list. Probably not one of their albums you will listen to over and over from beginning to end, but still amazed after all these years that there still isn't anyone else out there who can come close to DT's level of talent.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I never heard of Jason Mraz until a week ago when Amazon suggested the album when I was browsing for Lizz Wright. I listened to a few samples and went out to buy the album the next day. The songs are extremely catchy, all have their own character, are really original and do not bore you after a few listens. The production is also top-notch, quality of the recording/mixing is fabulous. The use of a horn section on a few songs is excellent, reminds me of Phil Collins' earlier albums. Absolutely recommended!

0810993139|5.0|I got this for my 8yr old who mostly likes to read scary stories like Goosebumps. He finished the book in one and a half day and kept coming to me to read me the funniest parts. Just about anytime I saw him reading this book he had a smile on his face and now he can't wait to read the second book in series. I read some of it too and it is so much fun.  This is the first time ever he preferred to read a book than to play video games...shocking!
0670020745|3.0|My husband is at risk for a stroke sometime within his life time (already had a very minor one), and so I read this book seeking the detailed information promised by a scientist.  The best information was to be patient, look the patient in the eyes, speak quietly and slowly over and over if necessary, stay positive and detail oriented, and develop daily plans.    Good information, but sometimes too much repeat information.  I also wished that the author had used less contrast description when talking about her first day and week after the stroke.  The message about her state of being and her \\"lost\\" abilities got lost in the words about what she \\"should\\" have been able to do.    One of many books.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|I never understood why Downey, Jr. received job after job after being released from prison.  I knew he was a good actor, but his portrayal of Iron Man and his performance in this movie was just phenomenal (I never saw the Charlie Chaplin movie).  I know this movie offended some, but my husband and I are Black and we missed some of the dialogue in this movie from laughing so hard.  We were picking out family members who really talk like that!  This movie is hilarious.  It's unfortunate that Oscars aren't considered for these types of movies/performances.  All of the characters in this movie contributed to it's pleasing experience, however, RDJ stole EVERY SCENE he was apart of.  Great Job, RDJ!!!  I'm now one of your biggest fans!!!
0930289234|4.0|As my title suggests, I found the book to be a gripping page-turner. For that reason I with-held a five-star rating - only because I found this book to be hard to put down, until the last chapter, when everything is wrapped up with a fairly deflated climax. Anyone who's studied composition knows the climax should occur a wee bit before the finale, but in this case everything just sort of shuts down right at the end. Other than that, one of the most gripping pieces of illustrated fiction I've ever seen!
B001G60FTI|5.0|I really love a good story, and the stories in this book were fascinating, especially since you weren't sure where each one was going.  So much food for thought-- you may just read it in a few days, but spend weeks thinking about it (or telling your husband about it over and over...).  Great!

0439813786|5.0|This is a unique reading experience. The story is exciting and moves along quickly, but what is unusual is that the illustrations actually tell part of the story. There are sections where there are 5-10 consecutive pages of illustrations without words carrying forward the story. It's different but entertaining. This gimmick would fall flat if the story weren't a good one, but it is. Very good.    My 8 year old loved it and couldn't stop talking about what was happening. I would say target ages would be 8-12. Teenagers might feel that a book with so many pictures is too young for them, but that's a shame because younger teenagers would probably enjoy it. With all the illustrations and exciting storyline, I believe it is a good choice if you are trying to coax a reluctant reader into trying something.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I bought David's CD as soon as I got off work today, and I think I have listened to it about three times now. I have read a few other reviews, most of which have called this a rock album. I have to disagree. I would classify it more on the pop side. Of course, with a few edgier songs. There isn't a song on the CD that I dislike....they're all amazing. David's absolutely incredible!! However, I just wish that a few more of the songs were along the lines of Bar-ba-sol. Permanent is my favorite, though. It showcases his beautiful voice, and you can place that into whatever genre you want to.
0743270754|3.0|Professor Matthew Pinsker has an interesting (cautionary) critique of Goodwin's book, Op-Ed section 11/18/08 LA Times:  \\"Lincoln and The Myth of Team of Rivals.\\" He offers some good points to keep in mind while enjoying the book.  The three stars are what Pinsker might have given, maybe four. See also Prof. James Oakes' piece in the NT Times, Op-Ed 11/20/08 for some further overdue de-hyping of Goodwin's book.  Lincoln would recognize the names, but he  probably would think the chemistry described by Goodwin never happened in his lab.
B000077VOY|5.0|STINGRAY was on Saturday morning television right after Tom & Jerry. It was a must for me. Stingray was the first of Gerry Anderson's supermarionation series, to be seen in color. I've have seen SUPERCAR and FIREBALL XL-5. As each series progressed, the better it got. I'm fan of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. As the series progressed over the seasons, the focus was on the Seaview and the new technology being created by Admiral Nelson. What I loved about Stingray, the series focused on the characters. Stingray was the perfect example of Good versus Evil and the good guys always won in the end. Stingray itself, a super submarine that was equipped with the latest technology, added to the appeal of the series. Even though Stingray was on for one season, its success and the way it was presented, led to the THUNDERBIRDS. Gerry Anderson did create live action series such as UFO and Space:1999. They did well in syndication. The supermarionation series such as Stingray and the Thunderbirds, is work that Gerry Anderson will be best known for. Stingray or any other of Gerry Anderson's series, is a must for anyones collection.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|This movie is great. It's amazing how Pixar can make a 90 minute movie with only about 500 words of dialogue and have it keep your 2 year old's attention the entire time. As with all Pixar movies your kids will watch it again and again. I love the shorts too. There is an extra short that wasn't released in the theater, so check the special features menu.    A word of warning to anyone that has a Sony Blu-Ray player. I have the BDP-S301, which for the most part has been trouble free. I received this movie last night and tried to watch it. THREE TIMES during the first 60 minutes of the movie the player locked up and I was forced to reboot it, which takes a long time. I tried again tonight and the player locked up two more times. It's a good thing I bought the DVD as well (for the car and traveling). I want my money back!!!
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home, was one of the best Star Trek movies involving the original cast. The movie was continuation from Star Trek III - The Search for Spock. During the opening scenes of the movie, Admiral Kirk and his crew, were making the hard decision to return to Earth to answer for their violations of Starfleet rules and regulations. At the same time, the alien space probe was approaching Earth and creating major problems. During the flight home, Kirk, Spock and McCoy discover the alien space probe was attempting to communicate with the humpback whales. During his research, Spock informs Kirk and McCoy, the humpback whales had been extinct on Earth since 21st century. In order to save Earth, the only viable solution was time travel. During the course of the movie, Kirk and his crew must locate humpback whales and make repairs to their captured Klingon Bird of Prey without violating the temporal prime directive or altering the time line to Earth's future. Adding to the problems, was Chekov. He was seriously injured trying to evade capture and Dr. McCoy did not leave him in the hands of 20th century medicine. For Kirk and his crew, it was a race against time. The whales they wanted were now in the open ocean and a rogue whaler had the whales in the sights of their harpoon gun. In the end, Kirk and his crew, accomplished their mission with little or minor damage to the time line. Admiral Kirk and his crew, were cleared of the major infractions that could of sent them to prison. The only thing that was distasteful, Admiral Kirk was held accountable for a minor infraction of Starfleet Regulations and demoted for it. If given a chance, he might have been able to clear himself.      The movie had a excellent story line and the special effects from Industrial Light & Magic, was the major draw to the movie. Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home, would be an excellent addition to anyone's movie collection. I thought it was appropriate for Gene Roddenberry and the cast& crew of Star Trek, to honor the crew of the space shuttle Challenger when the dedication appeared at the beginning of the movie.
B000SNUMC0|2.0|Having been a fan for a long time (10+ Years) I had some really high hopes for this album and unfortunately I didn't really like this at all. The music is average and the vocals are terrible.     Thankfully, Matt Barlow is back for Crucible of Man and that album is so much better than this one.  Especially the vocals!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Well done David Cook! This cd will not be leaving my cd player for a very long time! Very heartfelt lyrics and soaring vocals is what makes this so great! I can't get enough of it!!!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|WOW! David does come out with guns blazing indeed, just as he promised.  Please do yourself a favor and listen to this record at least five or six times before you dismiss it as generic pop. It is more complex than it seems the first time around.  It is actually quite brilliant, and just a foretaste of what is to come for this astonishing talent.<br /><br />I have written online about his vocal gift, from the perspective of vocal coach, vocal scholarship winner and pianist.  I have many years of experience in music including rock when I was young.  David Cook is a one-in-a-billion type of artist.  I seriously think he has the best vocal instrument I have EVER heard, in any genre. The voice just has shimmer and color that is highly unusual.  I describe it as a golden sphere, spinning on its axis, on top of a very tall and large cut crystal compote, and the prisms of color are shooting off in every direction!!! :D<br />God gave this young man a phenomenal gift.  Aside from the voice, his writing ability shows the potential genius he possesses.  Listen to his earlier writings. More than twice, please.<br />It hurts me for him when people don't \\"get\\" how incredible he is!!! He sings songs with a high degree of difficulty and margin for error. Takes more risks than most! The Voice does not eclipse the writing gift however. They are inextricably linked.<br /><br />Now for my review of the songs on this album:<br />Declaration - power. Sheer force. It's my new anthem for life right now!<br />Heroes - incredibly catchy. This will be a huge hit and on a big movie's soundtrack. Love it.<br />Light On - can you say \\"high C's spun out like gold\\"?? HARD! David, take care of the voice!<br />Come Back To Me - a very melodic tune that makes you want to sing along. Sweeping.<br />Life On The Moon - one of my favorites. Describes in a vivid way the life he was catapulted into by AI.<br />Bar-ba-sol - ummm, can you say \\"WOW!!\\"?? This is wildly good. In a league of its own!!!<br />Mr Sensitive - may be the best tune on the album.  Powerful and very original chord progression and melody.<br />Lie - the most generic one for me but he sings beautifully here (of course) and the bridge is killer.<br />I Did It For You - another amazing bridge and showcases his huge vocal slides. Sweet!<br />Avalanche - Stirring. Another favorite of mine. VERY catchy tune.<br />Permanent - heart-stopping...beautiful ...haunting.  Exquisite long notes. Very emotional.<br />A Daily AntheM - broad; Steve Perry-esque. Will be a huge hit.  Gets better and better.<br />[the hidden track is rather sexy - and fun!]<br />The Time Of MY Life - almost doesn't fit, but yet does somehow. It never grows old to remember his righteous win! And, the high note alone is worth the listen. This has been my anthem lately.<br />Now it is Declaration. We all have something to declare. David sure did!!!  BUY THE CD - you will NOT REGRET IT!!!<br />WE LOVE YOU OUT HERE, DAVID!!! YOU'RE ASTONISHING!!! (that's the closest word I have found to describe the Force of his Gift.)<br />Thanks for reading!  :)  God bless.  ~Rebecca Gilbert<br /><br />PS - one thing I failed to mention is that the use of DAVID'S own voice for harmonies gives the extra punch and double whammy resonance that is rare, no, impossible to hear elsewhere because nobody else has this Voice!!! He employed this on Analog Heart and the Axium stuff as well. It's a really powerful technique.ful and very original chord progression and melody.

1416562605|2.0|Just because NPR talks up a book and just because it was \\"shortlisted\\" for a prize does not make a book good. Perhaps my expectations were higher because of these things, but I still didn't find anything great between the covers.<br /><br />Balram is a poor Indian man who happens to get a good job as a driver for the son of a local landlord-mafia-type character. The mafia son seems to have more of a conscience than those he associates with and, in fact, seems to be the nicest person in the story. And at the very beginning of the story, Balram announces that there are \\"wanted\\" posters all over India with his face on it because he killed his nice boss and his family in the worst way you can imagine.<br /><br />So here we have this build up at the beginning of the story to this awful murder that's supposed to have taken place. And you continue to read and read and read trying to find out why the main character is so awful. You don't actually encounter the murder of his boss until 30 pages from the end. And he only assumes his family has been killed by the landlord-mafia-group as a result of him murdering his boss. The murder isn't a grisly one and all the story leading up to it is quite mundane.<br /><br />The only thing I can imagine that people are enamored by in this story is that it shows how a poor man in India (at least in this case) is only able to rise to greatness by killing a nice rich man. And it seems that Balram has learned not to let the little guy take the blame. Apparently, money can buy anything ... even reprieve from murder.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|In all seriousness, even with LOWERED EXPECTATIONS (I had heard this movie wasn't very good) the fourth Indiana Jones movie completely underwhelmed me.  I kept waiting for a good action scene (Shia Lebuff jousting with a Russian dominatrix on a car does not count) or an interesting plotline or some kind of payoff...NOTHING.  This movie is so far removed from the classic first two films (BTW, count me among those who loved Temple of Doom with its breakneck speed, thrills, general creepiness, etc.).  Now, I did not have any problem with the extraterrestrial stuff, as there was plenty of supernatural mumbo jumbo in the first three films...however, the \\"quest\\" in this movie LED TO NOTHING!!! There was NO PAYOFF!!! I didn't buy Harrison Ford as an action star any more, the characters were dumb, and I was left with a palpable anger towards Spielberg and Lucas for ruining a great franchise.  They spent years and years on this script...THIS is what they came up with?  Disappointing, to say the least.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Best Death metal band ever, period.  Cannibal Corpse just keep on getting better and better!  Each awesome album leaves you wanting more death metal carnage, this one is no exception!!!!
0790729377|4.0|Elia Kazan's adaptation of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is magnificent and ahead of its time with the issues it addresses.  His interpretation of Tenessee Williams' classic play is powerful and dramatic.  Kazan employs a fantastic cast.  Marlon Brandon plays an impeccable Stanley with intense emotions and a strong disposition.  Blanche is also portrayed very well.  Vivien Leigh brings Blanche fragility and vulnerability and she interacts with the other characters flawlessly.  Though her emotions are slightly over the top, this brings life to her character.  Overall this rendition of Williams' classic is a must see and is highly recommended
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I admit to being a skeptic about the causes and cures of global warming. I purchased this movie a part of my personal study to begin teaching Environmental Science at a Jr. College.  What a wake up call I got in this surprisingly compelling piece.  In addition to learning more about the \\"truth\\" of our environmental dilemma, I saw a completely different side of Al Gore - a soft, sensible, knowledgeable, and likeable person.  I've shown this movie to several classes and lots of friends.  A must see for skeptics and activists alike.
1595141979|5.0|This is book three in the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead.  This was a great book; I am so happy that this series has been consistently wonderful.<br /><br />In this book Rose is dealing with a lot of stuff.  The guardians are starting their field training, Rose is seeing things, and Rose has been out of control angry lately.  On top of all that Lissa's personal life keeps leeking into Rose's head while Rose is trying to get some rest.  Of course there is the deal with Dimitri; will they ever end up together?  There is also a rumor that the Strigoi are on the move.<br /><br />This book moved quickly.  Rose's character had some very interesting developments.  I liked that her and Christopher start spending more time getting to know each other, I also thought Eddie was a strong character in this book.  Lissa using magic again was also a nice touch.  The ending of the book caught me by surprise and made me really excited for the next book.<br /><br />I love these books.  The characters are very interesting and strong, the plot line moves along nicely, and Mead packs in some nice surprises.  Sometimes there is a little too much teenage angst going on, but well it's set in a high school so what can you expect?  I think that Rose is maturing nicely as a character, she is starting to become a true heroine and take her job as a guardian seriously.  Oh, yeah and did I mention she really kicks butt in the fighting department?<br /><br />Mead is a great writer and I look forward to reading more of her books.<br />[...]
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I want to start by saying i'm a HUGE pixar fan. I was there when they began and i grew up with their films, seeing every one of them in theaters and owning more than a normal amount of their merchandise. I was excited to see andrew stanton's sophmore directorial work at pixar and i was not dissapointed. this film is literally a masterpiece, you forget you're watching an animated family film after a while. it's dark, honest, and so absolutely beautiful, your jaw will be dropped and you will laugh alot. this film is funny and smart and is steering pixar in a whole new direction, now with that being said, i immediatley anticipated the dvd release of the film. after some lousy dvd releases for the last couple years (the incredibles being their last release to recieve a special edition), it was time for them to finaly go back to their hefty special edition packages, and once again i was not dissapointed. Literally up to the very day this dvd came out, i still was not sure what exactly i was getting. all the different versions and what not, it was hard to distinguish what came on what. so i finally cracked it open to see for myself and i was very pleased.    for a standard dvd, the picture, sound and film itself is like i said, incredible. so, considering i already went off about the film itself i'll just say i give it     10/10        now for all of you who are still confused exactly what these features include on the 3 disc standard release, i;m going to tell you once and for all.     first off, the packaging is way different from pixar's past releases. no slip case, no plastic case, none of that. instead, going along with the film's moral, the dvd comes in an eco friendly cardboard type case. for the 3 disc relase you pull open one side which reveals the first disc and the list of scenes and bonus features, you pull open the other side and that reveals the 2nd and 3rd disc along with a list of features. the case idea is kind of cool but can be frustrating to remove thediscs and what not.     now for the actual content....    i didn't have a chance to actually explore everything but i gota good idea of it all and the length and layout for everything. the first disc has the feature film, the short film, \\"presto\\" and the new to dvd short, burn-e(which is pretty funny but has alot of filler moments with actual clips from the movie to develop the story). there is also a featurette that talks with ben burt, the man behind the voice of wall-e. and wall-e's tour of the universe. there is also 2 deleted scenes that total in at around 10 minutes. the second disc has two pathways, kind of like the monsters inc dvd....\\"humans\\" and \\"robots\\"   humans section is more adult oriented and includes all the insight and goodies....the robots section is more for the kids and includes the animated storybook, and a couple other minescule features. the humans section is where it's all at. for the longest time it said there would be \\"making of\\" featurettes and i thought, \\"what making of featurettes, it doesn't say\\" wellthere are a handful of featurettes about different aspects of the film and the total time for all these is almost an hour long!   the bnl shorts consist of 5, 2 minute long \\"instructional\\" films. another big feature is the full legnth documentary entitled 'the pixar sory\\" (86 minutes long)this disc also includes 2 more deleted scenes that are a total of about 14 minutes long.      It'salways great to see a digital copy of any of your favorite films. i'm kind of new to this whole digital copy thing and i only have 2 other films in digital copy form. i was excited to get this onto my ipod but noticed that, unlike the other movies i have, this isnt meant to fit to screen. to only truly fit everything in the movie on the secreen, you have to play it in widescreen which if you have a regular video ipod like me, is kind of straining for the eyes.       Ok, so i rambled on about the dvd and other stuff for too long, but i have to say i'm glad tosee pixar is really caring about the dvd again. i'm still bummed blu ray owners still get slightly more features on their version. i'll have to put that on my x-mas list :)
1595141979|5.0|I can't believe how awesome this book was!  The first two were great, but this hit every emotion.  I am glad the next one comes out in Summer of 2009, but that still feels too far away!  But I will of course go from bookstore to bookstore and then finally ordering it on line, just like I did for Shadow Kiss!
0385340990|5.0|This is one of those books that makes you sad - sad that it has ended, because it is such a delight.<br /><br />I found it a bit slow to get into, but the very device which is a bit slow at first (the book consists only of letters between the various characters) eventually draws you fully in to the lives of these intriguing and charming (in the best sense of the word) people. You (the reader) come to know and to cherish them. And you hate to part from them.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|She is just so talented, sweet, and cute! Love her CD. Her new one is even better
031606792X|5.0|The Fourth book in this series has taken a lot of negative flack, very undeserved.  I found it immensely satisfying and the sort of ending I had hoped for after the second book.  The characters are full bodied and emotionally enjoyable.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This album really surprised me. I'm not really into Country music but I'm for this girl! Her songs are written by her and she plays guitar as well. She is extremely talented for such a young age and she really reminds you of what it was to be young again.<br /><br />My favorites are: White Horse, Fifteen (so cute and true), You're not sorry, Love Story, Fearless, and Change.<br /><br />This young girl is so inspiring and really fits the role model catagory for young girls today.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|If I didn't know who this was, I would have no idea that this is a first mainstream effort. It sounds like a sophomore album. I can't stop listening to it. It's a MUST HAVE for all rock fans - young, old and every age in-between.     GREAT WORK DAVID COOK!
B001ED7C58|5.0|There are so many varieties of songs provided on this one soundtrack that make it a must. I bought it on the release date and have been listening to it daily. The songs connect so well to the books. I love the fact that so many big name artists added songs to the mix and it is definately a great collection for any fan of the Twilight books
1595141979|5.0|This book was an amazing read, alternatingly funny and sad. The characters truly grow and change, and face well-imagined trials. The ending will leave you hooked and unable to wait for the next book. Be prepared to cry, though. I highly recommend this book. I t far outshines others of the genre, including STephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" by a long shot.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Very good cd.  Most of the songs are great and Cook's talent shows through.
0743437497|5.0|The one thing about this story that is often overlooked is that it is a metaphor...for alcoholism..a subject King knows about all too well. it is no surprise that King disliked Kubrick's interpretation, as it completely ignored this element. Jack Torrance was not an evil man. He was a loving father and husband who had bouts of evil when the Overlook Hotel exerted its influence on him..get the idea of how this book is a metaphor? Also The character of Dick Halloran plays a huge role in the book and Kubrick made him no more than the token mentor who always \\"dies in the end\\". Danny and Dick's relationship in the book is much deeper and significant. Even Wendy, Jack's wife shows an incredible strength and resolve that Kubrick seemingly ignored. Rebecca DeMornay (sp) was more true to Wendy Torrance. In short, the book is leaps and bounds better than Kubrick's interpretation..although on its own, Kubrick's movie has its own merits..the Twins in the hall (\\"Come play with us Danny\\") still creep me out to this day!!!<br />Do yourself a favor and read this book, it is deep, it is meaningful and it is far superior to Kubrick's interpretation
B001L4NJIO|5.0|Well worth the price!!  The sound AND picture are amazing!  The set list is fantastic and the playing is superb.  Stewart Copeland is one of very few drummers that can steal any show.  His playing on \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" is incredibly entertaining to watch and listen to. If you like the Police then this is an item to have.  The 50 minute documentary is entertaining too.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|\\"Wall.e\\" is an unique animated movie. This science fiction cartoon about a love story between two robots is very touching. Wall.e reminds people what can happen to the Earth if we don't take care of it. This film offers hope that the environment can change too. The animation is dazzling.  The bonus features are excellent too. The animated short \\"Presto\\" is very funny.  The other animated short is \\"Burn.e\\". This is pretty fun to watch too.  The other cool bonus feature is the commentary about how sound designs are created.  It features Ben Burtt who created all the sounds for the movie.  He provides a brief interesting history about sound design in movies too.  This DVD includes two great deleted scenes that were not in the movie.  They are very entertaining to watch.  Another thing I love about the movie is the excellent new song \\"Down To Earth\\" by Peter Gabriel.  Jeff Garlin, Kathy Najimy,  John Ratzenburger lend their voice talents to one of the best movies of the year.  It is truly delightful.
0375703861|4.0|White Teeth can hardly be called anything but epic - not only in length, but in the sheer volume of events that occur as the story unfolds. This a double-edged sword - while there are long sections of brilliant characterization and interesting plot-lines, there are extended sections of excruciatingly boring text which feel unnecessary as you're reading them. However, the greatest thing this novel accomplishes is to tie together all its strands, which continually wind tighter as the story leads to its conclusion. Most of the characters are at least entertaining, and two or three are outstanding. There are also a few annoying, boring characters which seem to add nothing to the novel at all - Clara's father comes to mind here.    This novel is certainly worth reading, even if some of the longer, less interesting sections of the narrative need to be skimmed through or skipped altogether. Truth be told, the reader would only be cheating himself to pass these sections by, as they do seem to pay off in the end. However, it reads like something of an endurance test at times, and a feeling arises that the author was being overindulgent in writing such a massive book. Despite its flaws, White Teeth showcases some excellent storytelling, and I would recommend seeing it out to the end, though I promise you, at times, it will be difficult.    8/10
B000024D4R|5.0|As a big fan of Pink Floyd, this is their best album in my opinion.  Perfect coreography of sound.
0385335997|5.0|I can never get enough of these characters and their lives. Ms. Gabaldon has an exciting creative mind!
B0000025DR|5.0|EXCELLENT! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I love all his songs, his special mentions: Come Back To Me, Declaration, Heroes, Permanent, Avalanche, A Daily AntheM, Kiss On The Neck (the very cute hidden track), Bar-ba-sol... actually they are all pretty great. I can just imagine him in his concert and everyone will be rocking with him during his \\"rock\\" set, and be in tears during \\"Permanent\\", I was in tears when I first heard it!. Perfect songs for a good concert.    As one of David Roland Cook's biggest fans, his first major album do not disappoint me at all.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Pixar, you've outdone yourselves on this one!  I won't go into the story because other reviews have covered that.  I do want to say that while the movie has an adult message and many small details that only adults will recognize and appreciate (much in way of the Shrek movies), Wall-E should appeal to all ages.  There's a robot romance and cute funny scenes that kids in the audience seemed to love, the animation is absolutely spectacular, and the story rocks.  As the credits rolled (you need to watch the credits for extra scenes) the entire audience applauded and cheered.    Those who didn't like this movie because they saw it as a movie about fat people are truly missing the point.  While I'm heavy myself, I didn't get that from it at all, but thought that the fat people were to make the point that sitting around letting technology do everything for us will help make us overweight.    A wonderful, utterly charming, heartwarming, endearing, and funny technological love story with a real environmental message, Wall-E is a keeper.  I'll enjoy watching it again and again!
B001KO8AQ6|3.0|It's a real snooze so far, but I bet it will grow on me.  She has such a gorgeous voice, it's too bad when the material doesn't measure up.
B001437DMA|5.0|Don't know, nor do I care what others say here because opinions are entirely subjective, mine included.  One word should suffice when it comes to this musician: virtuoso.  Consider the definition: \\"a musician who shows exceptional ability, technique, or artistry.\\"  That said, you'd get your money's worth out of this album with one song: \\"Revelation\\".  All the crappy, pimply, neo-rock vampire adjectives aside, this man is as good on the guitar as McCartney is on the bass, and that's saying something.  If you don't buy the CD (which would be a shame), at least buy the single.  You'll wear out your Ipod listening.
B000LV63SQ|4.0|Pete and Ronnie just getting together to rip one off. It works splendidly.  Some nice charachter songs, few rockers, good mix of both their styles. Recommend it even if your not a Who completist.
B001EO2UKO|2.0|Like many Dido fans, I had been waiting and waiting for the third album.  I loved her first two albums.  However, I am disappointed.  When I heard the single \\"Don't Believe in Love\\" I thought perhaps they had simply not chosen an appropriate song, but that is actually one of the more fast-tempo songs in the album.  The only two songs that stick in my mind at all are \\"Grafton Street\\" and \\"It Comes And It Goes\\".  The rest all sort of meld together as very minimalist instrumentally and similar-sounding.  If you like really relaxing songs with little melodic variation, like to hear Dido's voice and try to interpret the lyrics, and little instrumental interference, you will probably like this album.  For me, and probably many people who loved her last albums and the melodic richness, it is...for lack of a better word, boring.  I really really wanted to like this album, and have more songs to listen to over and over again in my stereo, but even the two songs that stand out in this album will probably not be played very often.  I still love Dido, I know she probably put a lot of her soul into this album, but I just cannot say I like it -     For the people who loved most of her old songs (particularly Hunter, Here With Me, Sand In My Shoes, This Land Is Mine, Life For Rent, White Flag, I'm No Angel, Don't Think Of Me, All You Want) - LISTEN to all the songs first before buying - hear the full versions first if you can, because the tempo-increase that you expect to come after the 30 second preview does not come.
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|Atmospheric.  Haunting.  I find it difficult to describe Elbow's THE SELDOM SEEN KID without falling back on vaporous language that neither describes nor illuminates.  But, simply, put this is one of the most interesting albums I've listened to in quite a long time.    THE SELDOM SEEN KID is a magnificently produced indie album that just manages to avoid being over done.  The keyboards are just right, the orchestration is spot on.  I found many of the gentle rhythms and melodies to be almost hypnotic.    This isn't an album of catchy pop-tunes; it took me a few complete listens before I could dig what the band was doing.  But once I got into it, I loved it.  It's slightly out of the mainstream; it's a little bit strange.  But it sure is great once you tune in to its wavelength.
B000002UJQ|3.0|Don't let the 3 star rating fool you. I love Radiohead. In fact, I think a few songs on here are among my favorite of their whole discography.<br /><br />However, I can't quite say the same over the majority of the album.<br /><br />To me as more of a listener, I don't try exploring all the little nooks and crannies of albums a lot of times and, perhaps and probably, as a result, I really couldn't and still can't see the massive appeal this album brings. Is it junk? Hardly.<br /><br />But I don't believe it deserves the massive reputation it has. Take my opinion with a grain of salt, though. Radiohead is a strongly developed and acquired taste. Both \\"The Bends\\" and \\"In Rainbows\\" took a fair number of listens before they really hit me as to how good they really were. Unfortunately, this album was the biggest let down for me. I had real high hopes for it, and seeing as how I like the aforementioned two albums much more, it's a major disappointment.<br /><br />That said, though, I still very much enjoy the songs on here \\"Paranoid Android\\" (very hard rock Radiohead), \\"Karma Police\\" (almost Beatles-esque), \\"Fitter Happier,\\" and \\"Airbag\\".<br /><br />Who knows, maybe I'll like it more with time.<br /><br />Will you? That's up to you entirely.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Vanishing Point is a movie I remember seeing on television as a child. I liked it because I've always liked cars and I liked muscle cars like the Dodge Challenger (love the 2008-09 model). Years later, I recorded the movie off of television on VHS, but the quality was so-so. I finally bought the DVD and I really like it. I loved the bonus features like the various movie trailers for the film and the directors commentary by Richard Sarafian. As a video producer and digital filmmaker, the movie still works for me. I did not outgrow it. Although, I think the drug use is a bit much, I understand how the experiences of the Kowalski anti-hero character would lead him to such behavior. Of note is the Super Soul character brilliantly brought to life by Cleavon Little. Vanishing Point is a great action car chase film, a wonderful exercise in filmmaking and a great look back at how films used to be made before the glitz and glitter of Hollywood CGI.
1932907009|5.0|As a screenwriter, as a skeptic, and a person who rarely takes anyone's advice, when I picked up this book I was like \\"Yeah right, another book to tell me how to write..\\" That's just what I need. But on the insistent advice of my co-writer, I said okay I'll read it.    So I read the book and let's just call it the single most influential 15 hours of the development of my writing career. It taught me how to think about story development in simple ways that can truly set you free as a writer. It taught me ways to represent how a story should look in a visual medium with the big-board. And overall it let the development process be as productive as possible.    In the end, it gives you the tools to help think most efficiently while developing the story. And the thing I like best, it never mentions one word about dialogue and \\"how to\\" write. Blake understands where the true creativity of the writer comes from, the words, and he leaves that up to you. So in my advice, buy this book, learn the techniques, and use them. And let your art of writing the language be the true skill instead of muddling with the development process..    And that's why I call it Save My A$$...
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I love the books and had high hopes for the show. The story lines they made up for supporting characters are awful. The whole drug angle with Jason is pathetic... They made Sookie into a self righteous piece of work, and Sam into a whiney dog boy... don't even get me started on Tara and her mother. I wish they would stick more to the vampire story line then focus so much on characters that are hardly in the books. Hopefully season 2 will be better and she can leave her goofy friends behind when she heads to Dallas.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|What else can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It reminds me of the comedies that Buster Keaton did and what he might have done with the technology we have now--very little dialog during the first half but full of character and emotion. Wall-E is the last of his kind; a robot designed to clean up an Earth that we have ruined. The rest of humanity has taken to the stars until Earth is cleaned up. 700 years later, Wall-E is still at it (which gives you an idea about how bad it was)when EVE arrives--another robot unit designed to find evidence of life and return it to the Axiom the ship housing our overweight, consumer obsessed descendants.<br /><br />The extras on the one disc version are quite good (I wouldn't spring for the three disc and as much abuse as this disc will get in my home I wouldn't spring for the pricy Blu-ray either)including \\"Presto\\" a delightful short that echoes the best Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd cartoons that Warner produced involving a rabbit, a magician and an act that has gone awry. \\"Burn-E\\" focuses on one of the service robots that we see in the movie. It's quite clever if less inspired.<br /><br />Other special features include deleted scenes, a \\"sneak peak\\" of \\"Wall-E's Tour of the Universe\\", a featurette on the sound design by Ben Burtt (who also did Wall-E's voice and created all of those wonderful sound effects for R2D2) as well as a commentary track by Director Andrew Stanton that is quite informative covering everything from the conception/changes to characters and storylines that they chose not to pursue.<br /><br />The 3 disc set evidently has a full documentary on Pixar and its history made by Leslie Iwerks the goddaughter of the great Disney animation pioneer Ub Iwerks.<br /><br />The DVD transfer looks wonderful.<br /><br />The packaging sucks. I understand that it IS important to send a message with eco-friendly packaging but the packaging on this looks like it was designed by someone who failed design school. THe disc will float around inside, get scratched (ours already was by the way)when it could just as easily been kept the same IF a small piece of plastic had been put (or even an adhesive spindle for the DVD)inside the packaging. It's a mixed message--a good movie with horrible packaging that will make sure that the disc is damaged with repeated use. It's a good thing I didn't spring for the more expensive set.<br /><br />Four stars for the movie, 1 star for the packaging. I'd suggest renting it if you want to see it once and then if you decide to buy it you might as well purchase one of those wasteful ecologically unsound DVD holders at a local retailer to store it in (the other option is a DVD plastic envelope).cratched (ours already was by the way)when it could just as easily been kept the same IF a small piece of plastic had been put (or even an adhesive spindle for the DVD)inside the packaging.

0143036556|5.0|In Collapse, Jared Diamond explains the failure or survival of societies spanning thousands of years and diverse geographies. Despite the subtitle, as he examines the complex ecological and social systems, it seems that, knowing what they did, there is little the 'failed' societies could have chosen to do differently. The answer to why some make it and some don't occasionally comes down to simple geography, but most often it has to do with how they adapt to their environment, not realizing that their way of life is, in the long run, unsustainable.<br /><br />Diamond makes the decisions and fate of the inhabitants of Easter island seem as logical and important as the concerns of modern day residents of Montana, and the broad variety of groups profiled shows why we can't think ourselves immune to the same problems.
B0001I55OC|3.0|Paul Walker is laughably horrific in his lead performance, but the presence of the ever charismatic Gerard Butler and Billy Connoly save the film from disaster.  Kate's character is played very poorly by a good actress, a fact which disappoints on several levels.  Of course the book is far better than the film, but for those of us who can't completely grasp all the scientific concepts alluded to in the novel, the movie serves the purpose of giving you the bare basics.  The fact that the movie disregards the common knowledge that modern French and English are far different from their Medieval counterparts is further exacerbated by the pathetic \\"Frenchman\\" of their group.  However, the historical romance between Marek and Lady Claire steal the show and bring this film from a taudry piece of poorly written scripting into a likeable film I'm willing to watch often enough to warrant purchasing.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I am a huge fan of the SATC show so I was a bit worried when they announced they were making a movie but it ended up being great.  I am starting to think that they can do no wrong, but who knows.  The movie follows where the show left off to an extent except it is a few years later.  I thought that it was well done and would recommend it to anyone who liked the show or to anyone who wants a refreshing chick movie.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|I have been writing reviews for movies since 1970, back when I was on my college newspaper.  I have seen some great movies, and by \\"great movies,\\" I mean movies like CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and CITIZEN KANE.  TROPIC THUNDER isn't in their league, but it is a GREAT movie, nonetheless. Funny on one level.  Crude on another.  A satire about the movie industry on still another level.  It's like APOCALYPSE NOW and NETWORK rolled together for the 21st Century.<br /><br />The acting centers around excellent performances by Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Barachel, and Brandon T. Jackson as solders in a Vietnam War movie who, due to cost overruns (after 5 days the movie is already one month behind schedule) are taken by the director to the jungles of Vietnam where it is to be shot \\"gorilla\\" style, ala BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.<br /><br />While all of the performances, including the strong support performances by Danny R. McBride and Nick Nolte, are terrific, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as five-time Oscar Award winning Australian actor Kirk Lasarus is phenomenal. Lasarus is so immersed in his craft that he undergoes a pigmentation alteration procedure operation to make him look like an African-American, and true to his craft, he declares that he remains in character until the DVD commentary is finished (which he actually did, as you will discover if you listen to the actor's commentary).<br /><br />In addition to outstanding comic scenes, action scenes, and satirical scenes, the interplay between black actor Brando T. Jackson as Alpa Chino and Robert Downey Jr., as Lasurus, is hilarious, but frankly the interplay between all of the actors is outstanding.  The screenplay written by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Ethan Cohen should win an Oscar.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT FOR JUST THIS PARAGRAPH: If there is any weakness in the Blu-Ray version, and the two-disk \\"Director's Cut\\"  ([[ASIN:B001H5X7JS Tropic Thunder)  (Unrated Director's Cut)]] DVD's by director Ben Stiller, is that the extra 14 minutes in the \\"Director's Cut\\" does not really add much to the movie.  In comparing the two versions, you see an extra snippet here and there, such as when Ben Stiller is asked by his agent Rick Peck, played terrifically by Matthew McConaughey, how the adoption is going, and we see Stiller looking for five-seconds at a 2-year old Vietnam boy with a real ninja knife in his hands, guarded by two burly bodyguards.  Or, an actor saying something in one version, and something else in the other version (as when Stiller says to Downey in the opening scene in the director's cut, \\"When we get back, I'm going to teach you how to juggle,\\" versus \\"When we get back, I'm going to teach you how to play the piano\\" in the R-rated version.) In the first instance, the 5-second glance at the adopted boy, if added to the movie would have made the scene at the end showing Stiller going back to stay with the boy even funnier.  In the second instance, it is a toss-up as to which one is funnier.  END OF SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />When these \\"Director's Versions\\" first cropped-up, it was usually because the studio wanted the movie a certain length and cuts had to be made and good scenes deleted.  However, now it just seems the \\"Director's Version\\" is used as another opportunity to sell the same movie to the public.  To me, and Director Ben Stiller noted several times in the \\"Director's Version\\" commentary, these \\"extras\\" were cut to make the theater version tighter, and this shows because the theater version flows better.  I wish we could have had both version on the Blu-Ray disc in addition to the great \\"extras.\\"<br /><br />BTW, I found it interesting that at a local store I noticed the \\"R-Rated Version\\" could not be purchased by anyone under 17, but the \\"Director's Version\\" could be bought by anyone, regardless of age.<br /><br />Speaking of the actor's commentary that accompanies all of the DVD versions, it is terrific, especially Robert Downey Jr. as he remains in character during his comments about the movie, just as he said he does in the movie dialogue.  The Blu-Ray disc has a few more extras than the double DVD version for approximately the same price, but its picture is so much better, so I would recommend the Blu-Ray version over the double DVD version if you have both types of players.<br /><br />I would be remiss to not mention one other performance, and that is the one given by Tom Cruise as the megalomaniac Hollywood producer.  His make-up was so good that in the theater when I saw the movie, I did not recognize that it was Tom Cruise playing the part.<br /><br />TROPIC THUNDER is not a movie for everyone, but if heavy doses of profanity and some grotesque scenes are not too upsetting, you will find it very funny and maybe even thought provoking.

B0013FBS20|3.0|This wasn't a bad movie.. but it's only 'okay.'  I wish I had rented it instead of buying the blue-ray.  This movie is very predictable and depends largely upon the depth of Will Smith's character.  I think they made a good attempt at developing a deep character, but ultimately I think the movie fell short.    I would recommend renting it instead of purchasing it.
1582701709|4.0|When I first read and saw the secret, it really motivated me to truly apply the LOA. I have always known about this law through the Seth materials and various new age writers from the 70s and 80s, but with the high production values, it added a different perspective to the whole topic. I know many people criticize this book a lot. But this was never meant to be the end all be all of the LOA, but an introduction to it. I also find it disconcerting that people harshly criticize it for not being \\"spiritual\\". The main criticism is that it focuses on material well being above all else. Well, I don't see what the issue is. Why not? I think the concept that material wealth and health as not being spiritual is based on outdated ideas of what spirituality is and what it is not. All things are God and anything, including excessive spirituality can be detrimental. It is about finding harmony. Through the Secret I was introduced to Joe Vitale and James Arthur Ray, both these authors have been vital to my growth. I think this is a good book to have.

I tried several times to listen to the digital tracks and i get annoyed I'm sorry but buyer's beware! SHE CANNOT LIVE OFF OF HER REPUTATION SHE NEEDS TO COME CORRECT NEXT TIME!

I have read it and listened to it countless times. It offers simple practical steps to living life more authentically. In fact, one principle about not taking anything personally fostered in me an amazing transformation. I had finally forgiven years and years of feelings I had towards a family member who is no longer with us. This book helped me get over it completely. I hope it helps you as well.

B000AADYYO|5.0|This is my third Opeth album and my favorite.  It seems to offer a more unique but consistent sound across the disk than the two previous I have, while remaining full of the contrasts (singing versus screaming, folk sound versus heavy sound) that goth bands like Opeth offer.  You'll listen a lot more times before feeling sated.    For what it's worth, I listen to prog metal, goth, shoegazer, musicals, opera, and some classical music.  I highly recommend this CD, although as a first Opeth CD it may leave you less to look forward to in your second.  In that case, Blackwater Park is also a good Opeth starter.  And I recommend Pretre conducting the opera Carmen.  But you were here to see a goth review. :-)

B0000931QA|5.0|I bought this CD in 2008 and have to say it really stands the test of time.  I expected it to give me a reminiscing experience akin to listening to Poison's greatest hits or some other 80's band.  It actually sounded current.  And, god, the story sure feels relevant to the year 2008.    Add to that the style of playing also has stood up over time so as to still sound good, and the fact it was recommended to me by others who first heard it post year 2000.  Definitely recommended.  Oh, and I'm not just a Queensyrche or just a metal fan.
0312427999|5.0|This is a well souced book about American style capitalism and how destructive to the world it has been, a horrific failure of tremendous scope--that is if the intention was to lift the people of the world up to a better quality of life. Klein lays the blame on Milton Friedman, a U. of Chicago economist. The author deliniates the strategy and the tactics through real world example after real world example. The question becomes: How was this possible? How can a few men, with very bad ideas, dominate the world to the accumulation of their personal wealth, at the expense of the great majority of people, under the guise of democracy? Answer: Through fear, lies, torture, state and intimate terrorism and; dare I say, greed, antisocial, and narcissistic behaviors. This happened not once--but time and time again, right on up through the disaster that is Iraq and the rebuilding of New Orleans. What is truly troubling is that this happened with the world watching and was, in fact, the policy of America. There are believers. And, if you are one of the beneficiaries of this policy then you probably don't care. Do you care now?
B001KO3FFW|5.0|I have been a David Cook fan since his first apperance on American Idol. I was disheartened to hear from the critics that his album was going to be a disappointment. I prepared myself for the worst. Then what happened? I heard it, and am glad to say the critics were wrong,I am pleasantly unsurprised at how good it is. This album fulfills all my hopes for his first album. Engaging, varied and thoughtful. Was \\"Light On\\" the best choice for a first single? Maybe not, other cuts are by far better. Do want some rock \\"Bar-ba-sol\\" is the song for you. Need something soulful to make you cry \\"Permanent\\" fits the bill. And I could go on.

B000021XS0|4.0|Having been a casual Rush fan since 1980 or so, I thought that I would give this group a try and generally liked what I heard.  In fact, I was surprised that I liked Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory (1999) as much as I did - I am far removed from being a heavy metal fan and prefer the \\"artier\\" sound of progressive rock.  The overall sound on this album nods in the direction of Rush, Styx, Metallica, and Queensryche, yet sounds very contemporary.  Above all else however, it is played at a breakneck tempo and with a sophistication that I have not heard in heavy metal since listening to my old Rush records.  Indeed, this is a fine example of progressive metal.<br /><br />The lineup on this album includes three former Berklee College of Music (Boston, Massachusetts) students: John Petrucci (electric and acoustic guitars); John Myung (electric bass guitars), and the Neil Peart-influenced Mike Portnoy (drums, percussion, and vocals), along with James LaBrie (vocals) and Jordan Rudess (keyboards, synthesizers).  As of this writing, these guys are in their 40s and 50s.  Joining the core group are guest musicians Theresa Thomason (bluesy/soulful vocalise on tracks 7 and 11) and a \\"gospel choir\\" consisting of several female and male vocalists.  The choir parts were arranged by the talented Jordan Rudess.<br /><br />These guys are positively top shelf when it comes to technical abilities and can play with blinding speed.  Although the \\"shredding\\" style of John Petrucci can (admittedly) be heard in any corner pub here in Massachusetts, what sets this group apart is the fact that ALL of the instrumentalists can \\"shred\\".  The fact that they can do it in unison and in odd time signatures is also pretty impressive.  While the group favors the tone colors of heavy metal (high pitched vocalist, distorted guitar played at a crushing volume), there are also acoustic textures here and there.  Unfortunately, I wish more had been made of the considerable abilities of Jordan Rudess - his synthesizer is simply pressed into service as another lead guitar more often than not.  I should not complain though - this is heavy metal after all.  Last but not least is poor John Myung - this guy is a great bassist but is unfortunately nearly completely buried in the mix.  This is too bad - boosting the bass up in the mix would lend this music extra punch and the added counterpoint would increase the sophistication of the ensemble work.<br /><br />The 77 minute long Scenes from a Memory suite is divided into two \\"Acts\\", with individual pieces ranging in length from 1:02 to 12:00.  The pieces flow together nicely, so there is not a sense of them having been arranged as a song-cycle.  In large part, the pieces alternate between sections that boast frenzied ostinati (repeated riffs) played in unison on the bass/guitar/synth and at blinding speeds, and softer, melodic ballads.  Although there are some faint whiffs of the 1980s power ballad and fairly maudlin moments accentuated by the overly dramatic vocal style of James LaBrie, the softer sections work just fine and nicely offset the heavier passages.  Overall, while the whole work sounds great, I wish there had been more variety in terms of tone color and the arrangements, along with greater use of rhythmic and harmonic counterpoint (\\"riffing\\" gets dull after a while).  I really should stop complaining though - this is a heavy metal album after all and these guys did a good job \\"sprucing\\" up the metal sound.<br /><br />In terms of the CD package it is pretty good and features the lineup and the lyrics.  Unfortunately, the production quality is not so hot (Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci produced the album).  Specifically, the keyboards are buried in the mix (save for the solo sections) and poor John Myung has all been mixed out of the album.  As can be imagined, the drums sound pretty good and John Petrucci is, well, everywhere.<br /><br />All in all, this makes for an exciting listen and would be a fine addition to your progressive metal collection.  Come to think of it, many fans regard this as the finest album by the group.  Recommended along with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002) to heavy metal fans that do not mind prog rock, and prog rock fans that do not mind heavy metal.ction.

1594201927|4.0|I'm not sure when Niall Ferguson finds time to sleep...<br />Fresh from a series of lively, accessible histories focusing on geopolitics -- the concept of empires, warfare, etcetera -- Ferguson, far from taking a well-earned rest, has tackled the toughest topic of all: the history of the global financial system. The author of other books on finance-related topics ([[ASIN:0465023266 The Cash Nexus: Money and Power in the Modern World, 1700-2000]]and [[ASIN:B000MAQV8S The House of Rothschild, the World's Banker 1849-1999]]), the author may seem to have returned to his roots. In fact, as his book makes clear, understanding how money and finance works can explain a lot about human nature and thus about our social and political institutions. Understand what money is, how it is made, invested and transfered, and you understand issues like equality, political instability and economic progress. After all, as he recounts, great fortunes were made by those willing to take risky financial bets on the eve of the battle of Waterloo. When final word of Napoleon's defeat arrived, the seeds of the Rothschild's vast fortune were sown, and the apparently nerveless Nathan Rothschild rode his stake in British government bonds higher and higher.<br />Ferguson has a knack for making this material accessible, whether it's the nature of what earliest civilizations considered to be \\"money\\" to the religious dilemmas that hovered around the concept of usury. (The popes in Rome denounced interest as usury.)<br />Of course, in the current environment, the most compelling part of the book will be the chapters Ferguson devotes to financial bubbles and in particular to the ongoing mayhem in our global financial system. Today's Rothschilds, those who have let their bets ride and rolled the dice over and over again, have finally lost out, and Ferguson gives what some are likely to view as an overly-simplistic analysis of the causes of this. (But this simplicity is likely to be very welcome to all those on Main Street who still view Wall Street as, in Ben Bernanke's words, an \\"abstraction\\".)<br />The most solid part of this analysis is, not surprisingly, the historical component. Thankfully, Ferguson avoids falling into the trap of giving readers yet another look at the great tulip bubble. Instead, he launches into an analysis of what kinds of risks speculators have taken throughout history, and the various ways they have come to grief.<br />The final part of Ferguson's argument is perhaps the weakest, although perhaps that is only because of the book's timing -- smack in the midst of financial chaos that he couldn't have imagined when he delivered the final manuscript. His look at behavioral finance is intriguing and welcome; his analysis of the behavior of today's \\"money movers\\", such as hedge funds is too simplistic. I'll look forward to reading an updated edition at a later date.<br />Most provocative of all are Ferguson's final conclusions about the role of China in the global financial system. For now, at least, the concept of decoupling -- much talked of before 2008 -- seems to have fallen by the wayside; in the current bloodbath, everyone is suffering in some way. \\"What price a subprime superpower?\\" he enquires, in the context of emerging global rivals. This, too, is a story that may be better told in a few years' time, since many of the most important issues can today be framed only as questions.<br />This is not a book for hardcore Wall Street folks or even those with a reasonable knowledge of the way financial markets have evolved (securitization, credit derivatives, hedge funds, etc.), unless they also have a strong interest in history. There are many other, better and more detailed books to satisfy them. This work, in contrast, gives any reader a firm base of knowledge as to how and why financial systems evolved. Perhaps it may even give them comfort that as we have survived periods of extreme financial crisis, so we will -- somehow -- survive thisone.<br />For anyone interested into delving into one particular era touched on by Niall Ferguson, I'd highly recommend the following: [[ASIN:0393328457 Medici Money: Banking, Metaphysics, and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence (Enterprise) (Enterprise)]]ted into delving into one particular era touched on by Niall Ferguson, I'd highly recommend the following: [[ASIN:0393328457 Medici Money: Banking, Metaphysics, and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence (Enterprise) (Enterprise)]]
B000A59PMO|5.0|As anyone reading this review is probably already aware, \\"Veronica Mars\\" is essentially an updated version of \\"Nancy Drew\\", by way of Raymond Chandler, and \\"Twin Peaks\\". However, it is so much more than the old \\"Nancy Drew\\" TV series of the 1970's. This is an intelligent and funny TV series that, although targeted at a teenage audience, is smart enough to interest and entertain adults. The main plot line of this season centres on the murder of Veronica's best friend Lily Kane (Laura Palmer for the next generation), with other continuing storylines and single episode stories along the way, to keep the audience interested... and this definitely maintained my interest. By the final episode, I found myself comparing this series favourably to the much acclaimed \\"Damages\\", and when Lily's killer was finally revealed, I felt even more satisfied than I did at the end of \\"Damages\\". This show kept my family guessing for weeks and did not disappoint any of us. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that all of the clues are there, you just have to put them together - the mark of a great mystery. This show will definitely go down as one of my all-time favourites.
0143038419|1.0|Sadly, the fact that this book is by a woman mostly aimed at women is embarrassing. This book was planned by the publisher and by the author; it was no true journey of the soul but more like a carefully crafted publicity angled journey.    Gilbert has a problem with the Bible, but easily accepts the doctrines (teachings) of her Guru, the Balinese medicine man, and others, including written Hindu scripture like the Upanishads. The only doctrine Gilbert has any problems with is that which denies that there are many ways to God or teaches that there is only one way to God. This is what she is talking about.    Let us consider where you end up if you think doctrine doesn't matter. It can take you to a place where there are no distinctions between anything because there are no authoritative boundaries between what is good or evil, or what is true or false. Everything is determined subjectively. This is exemplified in the medicine man in Bali, Ketut, who thinks all religions are \\"same-same,\\" and heaven and hell are ultimately the same, as well. In fact, he says that hell is love. This is even startling for Gilbert, although she believes everyone is divine. So if that is true, and if there is a hell, then it would be full of divine beings as well. No distinction between good and evil means that good and evil don't ultimately matter.    Gilbert gives the idea that everything is spiritual as you long as you \\"feel\\" it. This book exalts that which is shallow and self-absorbed, not what is truly spiritual.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|All The Right Reasons will probably be Nickelbacks best album, but this is a close second.  The only thing I don't like about this album is the name and album cover, couldn't they come up with something more creative?  I loved the album cover and name for All The Right Reasons since day one and still do and I think its there best cover.  The cover art here just seems bland and boring but its not about the cover its about the music and the music is the still the same old Niceklback we have grown to love.  Also to the people who complain that Nickelback write the same album and same songs over and again there not the only band that does that AC/DC has made a 35+ career doing that and they still continue to put out great albums so whats wrong with that?  Although I wish Nickelback would branch out a little bit and try something new but I've grown to accept it.  I'm a long time Nickelback fan ever since I heard Leader of Men on the radio I knew this band had potential and I was right it seems they get better with each CD.  Dark Horse is one of those albums that will grow on you which was the case for me.  I didn't like it at first but the next go round I was hooked.  I can't name the best songs on this album because they are all good and single-worthy which is why I gave the album 5 stars if I had to say a song I didn't like it would Burn it to the Ground I don't know why I just don't like this song.  So for all who loved All The Right Reasons theres no reason why you won't love this album and be sure to catch them on there 2009 North America tour they are great band live.

He even says that if the Buddha didn't agree with him, Buddha would be wrong.<br /><br />There is no evidence in the book that Tolle is enlightened at all.

0930289234|2.0|What's all the fuss about?  This may be a landmark among comic books, but as far as stories go it's pretty unremarkable--not to mention its 1980's cold war story is quite dated.  Since most of the book is taken up by cartoonish drawings there's little room for things like character development or depth.  If you like comic books, by all means pick this one up.  But if you like reading novels don't bother.
B001ESYAJY|2.0|The soundtrack to \\"Quantum of Solace\\" carry on the tradition of how the music of the James Bond films is becoming more and more irrelevant.    When David Arnold scored Pierce Brosnan's final Bond film, he declared that he didn't incorporate any of Madonna's title song into his score. Well, he shouldn't be talking because ultimately, her song turned out to be more interesting than his score for the movie. I do not understand why the people who run the Bond empire continue with David Arnold. Past non-John Barry composers like Bill Conti, George Martin and Marvin Hamlisch managed to leave their own indelible mark on the Bond movies music-wise, their scores are considered classics. Songs by Hamlisch and Conti had even been nominated for Oscars. Time will tell if Arnold's scores will be held in such high esteem but I sincerely doubt it.    The big problem with the music for the Bond movies is that after \\"The Living Daylights\\" and with the departure of John Barry, it seems the people who run the Bond empire no longer care about the soundtracks of the films. They want the songs to be sung or composed by the current big name artists regardless whether if it is any good or appropriate. As for the music, for the most part, you can't hear them anymore. All the action sequences are so inundated with loud crashes and explosions that the music is totally drowned out. For example, Arnold's \\"Backseat Driver\\" for \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\". I think that is one of his best compositions but watching the movie you wouldn't know. So, music no longer sets and complements the movies, it has become filler.    So it is little wonder that David Arnold's most recent work is so bone-dry dull. Granted that Arnold does have his moments. This man can compose songs that can give John Barry a run for his money, but unlike Barry, he never seems to hit the mark.    The weakness of \\"Quantum of Solace\\" soundtrack is the fact the film itself is one action set piece after another, and from past experience, Arnold's action cues are generic and interchangeable. Given that he didn't write the theme song to the movie, there is really no central theme that runs through the soundtrack to give it a unified whole. The more interesting tracks of \\"Quantum of Solace\\" are actually some of the shorter ones such as \\"Inside Man\\" and \\"The Dead Don't Care About Vengeance\\". \\"Talamone\\" opens up with shades of  \\"You Know My Name\\" from \\"Casino Royale\\". \\"Field Trip\\" teases us with hints of the James Bond theme.    I noticed a lot of people are complaining about the lack of use of the James Bond theme. I for one glad Arnold avoids it, for he often runs out of ideas and just stick it in there.    The music \\"Run Crawl Run\\", which is the end titles for the film was omitted from the soundtrack. That proves to be one of Arnold's more interesting compositions, so I wonder why it was left out.    Finally, the song by Jack White and Alicia Keys: \\"Another Way to Die\\". It ranks as one of the worst Bond songs ever written. The title sequence (which feature the return of nude female silhouettes) edited out most of the crappy parts of the song and the imagery of Bond in a desert comprise of naked women actually made it palatable.    As a Bond fan, I got this soundtrack because I am a completist. Although I like Arnold's \\"Casino Royale\\", \\"Quantum of Solace\\" made me realized that \\"Royale\\" was just a fluke. As the old saying goes, if you throw enough mud on the wall, some is bound to stick.
B000000Y59|5.0|I'll be brief: Bill Evans is, in my esteem, the most devastatingly moving piano player ever to walk this earth.  He is at his absolute best here, full of subtle, deep emotional expression and swinging hard with the rhythm section, often at the same time.  Evans, LaFaro and Motian are simply unmatched in their cohesiveness and supreme ability to listen and respond instantly to one another's improvisational threads and evolving harmonic and melodic ideas.  \\"Portrait in Jazz\\" is an absolute necessity for anyone who loves Bill Evans, or anyone who wants to understand why so many of us do.
B0002S947K|5.0|I love this album. I love it in a way that makes it a soundtrack for those rainy nights when I want to do nothing else but stay in with the woman I love. This is a passionate album.
B001KVZ69I|5.0|What did the Holocaust look like through the eyes of Jewish children consigned to the concentration camps? Or through the eyes of an entirely normal Nazi family whose father was \\"promoted\\" from Berlin to Commandant of a death camp in the countryside? Bruno is only eight years old, so he's naturally curious about the \\"farm\\" only a few hundred yards from his family mansion, where people wear striped pajamas with numbers on them. Where black smoke billows from chimneys, and where horrid smells fill the air. And if Pavel was a doctor, why is he now wearing those pajamas and peeling potatoes for his family? Bruno forms an unlikely friendship through the electric barbed wire with another eight-year-old, Shmuel. The innocence that they share puts into bold relief the horrendous consequences of the Holocaust -- for the Jews, of course, but in unlikely and catastrophic ways for every member of this prim, proper, and patriotic family whose father was responsible for \\"making the world better.\\" The film explores a horrible paradox of the Holocaust -- that an evil of unimaginable magnitude was carried out by everyday people just like us.
1416562605|5.0|Hearing on PBS that Aravind Adiga had won the Man Booker Prize for this his first novel, and that he was only the second person to win this prize for his first novel, I decided that this was a book to read.  I assume you have almost made a similar decision but are reading this review before completely committing yourself. If you wish to cut to the chase, buy it, read it - but I will go on.  At the tail end of my copy of The White Tiger is the transcript of an interview with the author. At one point he states, \\"The main reason anyone would want to read this book, or so I hope, is because it entertains them and keeps them hooked to the end....I hope my readers will find this book fun too.\\" Well the book kept me hooked and some moments were funny...but.  The humor is black and reminds of Dickens at his best, and the background of his novel which Adiga describes as \\"pretty mainstream (India), trust me,\\" has also a Dickensian cast. We find powerful and evil business men called \\"The Stork\\", \\"The Mongoose\\", etc. There are corrupt police and politicians. All could have fitted in one of Dickens novels. At the end of my copy there is a Reading Group Guide. One of the \\"Questions for Discussion\\" listed is, \\"Do you think of the novel, ultimately, as a cautionary tale or a hopeful one?\\"  Take warning from this questions. A case can be made either way.      I have already suggested you read this book. It is well written with well drawn characters in an intriguing plot.  It is short - 279 fast turning pages - and requires little more Hindi than one might have already picked up in an Indian restaurant.  I have not told anything of its plot because I do not want to spoil any of the pleasure you will get in encountering how Mr. Adiga tells his story.
B001ACH4DS|1.0|A little dissapointed that David's exceptional voice barely peeks through the repetitious background music.  In other words, it all sounded the same with the exceptions of tract 11 and the bonus.  But then I'm of a different generation.  Not the one that this is targeted for.  I'm still a fan, still love his voice.  I hope in the future he showcases his wonderful vocal range and reaches out to a broader audience.
B001GQO50I|3.0|Doors opened the next room to rock. Poetry paired with emphasized organ, eclectic electric guitar, and steady drums, no bass player!? A lead singer that embodied late '60's and the future.     The Doors were an LA phenomenom Sunset Strip club band, making the scene, driving teens crazy with sexual agnst and provocative performances. They recorded their first LP late 1966 and had a local top 40 hit with \\"Break on Through\\". It wasn't until the summer of '67 that the Doors truly broke on through with one of the greatest rock songs ever, \\"Light My Fire\\" It lit the airwaves and made \\"The Doors\\" one of the best selling LPs of all time.    This 2 CD set is live Doors at the Matrix, a small club in San Francisco. The Matrix was intimate, small room, and at the apothesis of SF. It was partially owned by Jefferson Airplane founder, Marty Balin, and held gigs by seminal SF bands like Great Society, Big Brother/Holding Co., etc.     History/Rumor has it that when these recordings of the Doors were made in March 1967, that only 10 or so people were in the club. It sounds like that. However, it should be noted that the Doors were not some audition band, they had a local hit and a released LP.     Listening to this oft-bootlegged set of this Matrix set sounds contradictory to \\"The Doors\\", their initial LP,released late 1966, one of the best produced, finest performances ever. Here, the Doors sound exploratory, loose, even tenatative on what were already signature songs.     What a difference! The live performances have a thrill, an up-there, I see! mistakes and takes ya back! The set list has most of all of \\"The Doors\\" and the elementary hints of the next LP soon to be recorded/released a few months later. The first glimpse of \\"When the Music's Over\\" and \\"People are Strange\\", a work in progress.     The sound is fine, particularly for a decades old beat-up tape from a long-closed nightclub. It sounds best really loud. Keep that in mind..
B0000026NC|5.0|I was born too late to know much about the early Pink Floyd, and although I've since grown to love most of their songs and albums, I've never been someone to fuss over the band's different permutations.  So, if you're a raving Pink Floyd fan, or someone with astute technical and background knowledge of the band, I ask you to understand the spirit with which this review is written.  Here it is:<br /><br />This album introduced me to music.<br /><br />I grew up in a strict religious household, the son of a Baptist minister, and during my most impressionable years, MTV (and, to a lesser extent, VH1) were in their hey-day.  I was, of course, not allowed to even think of watching either channel.  Up until the late eighties and early nineties, most of my music knowledge was of the gospel variety.  And not even of the raucous, emotional gospel you'd find in a 1930's N'awlins Church.  More the dry, dusty \\"hymns\\" that are sung from wide mouths and rigid spines.<br /><br />Puberty taught me the pleasures of rebellion, as it has many others, and one day I decided to turn to MTV and see if the devil's music was as bad as my parents always said.  The first video I saw was the live version of \\"Learning to Fly.\\"  I was blown away.<br /><br />As soon as I had scraped together enough cash to purchase my own Discman and an album, I went looking for a Pink Floyd album.  I found this set, and was bewildered and excited by the bizarre coat of lightbulbs and ominous horizon of the cover.<br /><br />You can pore over technical details and fuss about Roger Waters or studio finesse versus the energy (and alterations) of live shows, but if you're capable of and prone to that, then you don't need reviews like this to tell you if the album's any good anyway.  If you're young and don't know, or if you know OF Pink Floyd but are not a \\"follower,\\" or if you're just new to music and looking around, I can say that it is very hard to do much better than this album.  I have since gone on to [[ASIN:B000002B35 Pulse]] and [[ASIN:B0000025H6 The Wall]] and the uneven but addictive [[ASIN:0711993939 Echoes]], but nothing has ever matched this album for me.  It is, in fact, the only album I've ever owned that every one I know likes, that no one complains about if it is on, and that always strikes some kind of chord with each listener.<br /><br />Perhaps I feel this way about DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER because I discovered it at such a tender and vulnerable age, back when I was first learning the power of things like music and emotions and ideas and dreams.  Perhaps it is because the album (and the songs themselves) are so sublimely expansive while still being introspective and singular.<br /><br />It's fitting that this album is the first rock album to ever be played in space, because it has that feel throughout.  The complexity of the universe magnified so large as to be beyond comprehension, and then focused on us as single souls amongst it all.  It's as beautiful as seeing the sun rise from beyond our own atmosphere, as inexplicable as a meteor shower, and as thrilling as reaching escape velocity.  I recommend it highly, and to everyone.he Wall]] and the uneven but addictive [[ASIN:0711993939 Echoes]], but nothing has ever matched this album for me.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|This CD is so thought and emotion provoking!  David Cook reaches in and touches your soul.  Is DC perfect? No, so let's not expect perfection.  No one is perfect.  It is obvious that David Cook puts his heart and soul into every song he sings.  He doesn't pretend to be anyone else, he just wants to be himself.  His genuineness and honesty is what makes him unique.  His amazing talent for expressing himself in his lyrics and in his outstanding voice that reaches the heavens, is what draws you into his music.  It's unfortunate that some did not enjoy the CD.  They are truly missing out on something great.  There is the saying, \\"Live in each moment\\" or \\"Take one moment at a time\\".  With David Cook's CD, \\"Live in each song\\", and \\"Take one song at a time\\".  Those who spoke negatively about this CD is because they did not follow that.  David Cook puts out music that is diverse and provactive in the sense that you need to immerse yourself into each song and let it stand alone, instead of forming an opinion of the CD as a whole.  There is much to gain from his music if you do this, or you will miss DC's true intentions.      When David Cook won AI, I screamed which isn't something I routinely do.  I thoroughly enjoyed his music on AI and I was so amazed at how he could take any song and make it his own.  Incredibly inventive!  David Cook's winning song, \\"This Is My Life\\", was a great song because I was at a crossroads in my own life and it moved me to believe how it was time for me to stop hiding in the crowd and embrace my life out loud.  I think DC's song, \\"Permanent\\" is so incredibly beautiful.  With the wonderful piano and strings, it gives David a chance to show the depth of his talent and ability to use his beautiful voice range that fits each song.  This song brought tears for me because even after 17 years, the pain of losing my dad to cancer was still very much in my heart.  Also, 3 years ago, my daughter and son-in-law lost their precious 26-day-old son during open heart surgery.  He was such a sweet little boy who fought his own battle with so much bravery.  He was so young, but you could feel his great strength.  A year later, they were gifted with expecting identical twin girls.  One of my twin granddaughters went on to be stillborn and our little survivng miracle was born 3 months early, weighing just 2 lbs. and 14 inches long.  Now she is 2 1/2 years old and is definitely her own person as DC is.  So \\"Permanent\\" touches me deeply.  Mostly, it reminds me of my little grandson who I called my little warrior, Braveheart, who lost his valiant battle.  It is difficult to pick a favorite song on this CD because each one has its own special uniqueness about it.  I definitely reccommend purchasing \\"David Cook\\" and discover for yourself the amazing depth and  talent of this young man who is only 25 years old!  I really look forward to future CDs!!
0439813786|5.0|Truly a book for all ages.  Even as an adult, the story was fascinating and the storytelling style refreshing and unique! I hope to travel to Philadelphia one day soon to see the automaton myself.  This book will be a treasure and a story that I will recommend for many years to come. Don't miss it!
B001FSDOZO|3.0|Sadly, Nickelback has become the Jackie Collins of modern rock.   Dark Horse is no more than another formula album, more of the same that we've heard on \\"All the Right Reasons\\" or \\"The Long Road\\".   You have the juvenile hormonal-rush songs (S.E.X., Something in Your Mouth), the \\"wish I could find somebody to love\\" songs (Gotta be Somebody), the relationship songs (I'd Come for You) and the attempt-to-philosophize songs (If Today Was Your Last Day).  Possibly worst of all is the party rally song \\"Burn it to the Ground\\" which is unpleasantly reminiscent of Twisted Sister's \\"We're Not Going to Take It\\" or Quiet Riot's \\"C'mon Feel the Noise\\".  Perhaps the Nickelback boys should rethink their inspirations and try to emulate a really powerful party song, like Axe's \\"Burn the City Down\\".    Dark Horse has nothing new, nothing to knock your socks off: no growth, no maturity.   And without the latter elements, how can the band expect to truly progress?  The one element they did have, sincerity, or believability, has been compromised with Dark Horse's--yawn--\\"more of the same\\" offerings.      Unfortunately, it is likely this lame effort will thrust Nickelback further up the superstar ladder.  But for this reviewer, heretofore a diehard fan from the first time I popped \\"Curb\\" into the CD player, it has taken them off an already VERY short list of \\"must buy\\" artists.  Perhaps their next album should be called \\"W.A.S.T.E.D\\": Well-known Artists Sacrifice Talent (for) Easy Dollars.
0765348780|1.0|I just finished my reading of \\"Gardens of the Moon\\".  I say my reading because I couldn't get past the first 60-70 pages.  But I'm done.    This book is incredibly dense, slow, and convoluted - yet not in a good way.  I generally give books about 40 pages to interest me.  I know of professional reviewers that do the same.  I only read more than that because it had been compared to George R.R. Martin and he is among my favorite authors at present.    And just so that one doesn't think that I'm too stupid to get into it: I read Tolkien in elementary school, Robert Jordan in middle school, and I am presently in law school.  And yes, I find this book convoluted and dull in comparison to the readings I do for law school - at least in them I can usually figure out what's going on.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|im an old fan,seen em numerous times,but i stopped just like many of you did.i picked this up to give them one last chance....i'm glad i did!!!!this should've been the album after and justice.they're finally writing memorable riffs again,like they use too.i know many will hate me for this,but i actually like this album better that lightning...hmmm
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Didn't know he had this in him. I have always respected him as an artist but couldn't quite follow his musical direction in the past 10-15 years. Song for song this is his best album ever. Finally great music AND lyrics.    It is like a deeper Human Touch with sophisticated rock parts like Born in the USA and emotion like The River.  A must-buy for any Springsteen fan and anyone who wants to know how a rock album is really done.
0439023483|4.0|I definitely felt this was going to be an unoriginal idea... at first... but then I read on.  The book is very well written and the characters are worthy of the time we invest in them as the reader.  But I couldn't help but think that this book seemed to fall into an overly re-used idea... something fun like a game (of challenge / chance / etc) is misdirected to us as innocence lost.  This idea of the  Twilight Zone twist that people now come to over-expect was once a great treasure in Science Fiction - \\"The Future that Could Be\\" and these types are always distopian in nature.  Similar to Stephen King's The Running Man or Takami's Battle Royale or even slightly toward Shirley Jackson's The Lottery  - the author lets us feel comfortable in a subject we have been immersed in culturally for thousands of years and then twists into a horrible feeling of disgust.  The capturing of the characters familiarity to this otherwise alien idea only fuels the readers fascination.  If you read this and find the story intriguing, then other books of this genre should not be overlooked - especially books from first half of the 20th Century (which often come closer to predicting the future then we would've ever imagined).
B000URDEB0|5.0|im not quite sure how these people do not like anettes voice or give it a bad review. Yeah tarja was an amazing vocalist but anette is too. There is not one crappy song on this album. Its probably one of the only albums id give a 5/5 for. it doesnt matter how many times i listen to the album. it never gets old. Even the bonus tracks on all the limited additions are amazing. Ive been into metal for quite awile and this is one of the best bands lyrically, musically and vocal out there. this one will not dissapoint, not one bit.
B001AUEMFS|1.0|I find this album a little empty except for Viva la Vida.  The other songs i found bland and unamusing.  However, Viva la Vida went straight to the top of my Ipod playlist.  It was the one exception to a rather lousy album.
B001GNRNQE|5.0|This album is great. I haven't always been a fan of hers but when the ablum came out i decided to get it and i am glad i did. I had to lisgen to it a couple of times and now i can't put it down. Good Job Jennifer!
B001KQIAXM|5.0|I was blown away the first time I turned on this album.  It was the first time I had ever sampled Beyonce and i was dumbstruck.    It is one of the best items I own.  Simply put, If you love music, you must have this album.
B000UJCALI|5.0|\\"REDRUM,REDRUM...\\" CREEPIEST & BRIGHTEST ON BLU-RAY!!! ALL I WANT TO ADD TO MY PREVIOUS REVIEW OF \\"THE SHINING\\" NOW ON BLU-RAY IS THAT STILL REMAINS ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FILMS EVER MADE SPECIALY THE HIGH DEF TRANSFER & DTS SOUND. PLAY THIS VERSION ON YOUR BLU-RAY PLAYER & YOUR WIDESCREEN HD TV  WITH THE LIGHST OUT IN A WINTRY NIGHT - IT GAVE ME NIGHTMARES!!! There's so much to say about this HORROR CLASSIC \\"THE SHINING\\"! Specially for Mr. Jack Nicholson's great performance - Chilling, disturbing and REALLY SCARY!! I have seen this movie over and over again since it's release in 1980 and every time I watch it I discover new layers and levels of psychological horror in the way Mr. Nicholson gradually descends into madness until the very end when he tries to CHOP HIS FAMILY TO PIECES!! Then the ghostly apparitions - THE DEAD TWINS inviting little Danny to \\"COME AND PLAY FOR EVER, AND EVER AND EVER\\"!!  JUST WRITING THIS REVIEW GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS! And of course all the supporting cast is excellent too! - Ms. Shelley Duval and Mr. Danny Lloyd must have been scared to death!  This is a great issue of this movie for a great price for 2 disc set and in widescreen transfer for the first time ever! I can honestly say there are 2 TOP WACKOS in the history of Hollywood movies: NORMAN BATES (Mr. Anthony Perkins) and JACK TORRANCE (Mr. Nicholson) AND BOTH LIVE \\"FOR EVER, AND EVER AND EVER\\" for true horror fans like myself!! DO NOT MISS \\"THE SHINING\\"!! THANK YOU MR. STANLEY KUBRICK!!![[ASIN:B000UJ48WC The Shining [Blu-ray]]]
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Possibly one of the worst movies ever made, dare I put it right up there with WATERWORLD? I tried, I really tried but no matter what, I hated everything about this film. Everyone involved with this film, should be ashamed of themselves! It is time for Harrison Ford/Spielberg/Lucas and Co. to just stop and smell the Bengay. They are too old and this franchise ran it's course, as had STAR WARS. Move on or retire, please for the sake of all of us. And Shia Lebouf? Please, please, let Transformers 2 be good, 'cause this was not his most shining hour but he's young, he can move on, as long as he stays out of trouble. And Karen Allen? Not hard to see why she hasn't been working anymore. Too bad really but it's over. Couldn't wait to get this movie out of my house. Got it at the library, so wasted no money. I'm done and exhausted from disappointment.
1416562605|5.0|Clever and well written.  One of my favorite books in a long time.  Humorous and serious at the same time, Adigo challenges us to examine the profound changes that India is experiencing not only economically, but socially.
B001EOQWEO|3.0|I loved the film. Loved it.   Those consideriing buying the 3 disc special edition should be wary. I havent had the trouble some others have had with the discs themselves. the packaging SUCKS. BIG TIME SUCKS.     Its very difficult to remove the inner sub-sleeves (I wont call them cases) from the outer package (again I wont call it a case) the first time without accidentally ripping the sleeve apart. The die-cuts on the sleeves want to grab one another and the outer package. Children will almost undoubtedly end up tearing the sleeves and probably the outer package apart just trying to get the sleeves out of the package to watch the disc.    After buying so many dvds & dvd sets in nice molded plastic cases, to get a cheap cardboard case, and a poorly designed one at that, is very disappointing (especially when compared to the other Pixar dvds in my collection. Wall-E deserved much better, and Disney owes its customers replacements.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|It's and amazing first release and all the songs are hit singles.  It is like a \\"best hits album\\" for most singers/bands.
B001F290E4|5.0|this cd is one of seals best. i just love his voice and this one i think i like even more than the others. brings back memories. i think if you follow his music as i have you will see that he can sing anything and make it sound like a hit! he has a unigue voice that i love. i will buy every cd he comes out with. knowing i won't be disappointed.i will play this one until i wear it out!
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|What's changed in cheap clueless teeny bopper market driven pop? Nothing. The more things change...
B0010DRYVO|5.0|Casablanca is perhaps considered one of the best well-done and most-respected movies of all time. Before I even watched the film, I knew that I would love it from start to finish. So if you are sitting at home wondering what movie to watch, I recommend Casablanca because you will not be disappointed. Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart both do an amazing job in this film. Also this Academy Award winner for Best Picture clearly deserves a round of applause. Perfect film for families, couples, or anyone who wants to enjoy a good movie. Next time you are at Blockbuster or ordering off of NETFLIX, choose Casablanca as your next movie to watch.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|\\"Slow Dancing In A burning Room\\"...Priceless.From the very first note my heartstrings were pulled.   One must hear it being sung by John (L.A.)to get the full affect behind every note... Not Since Barry White's \\"Whatever We Had, We Had\\", The Temptations' \\"Memories\\" or even Enya's \\"Evening Falls\\",have I felt such an embrace of the bittersweet taste of love and the joy of being alive to experience such human musical brilliance. Savor it...don't swollow just yet... As Barry put it, \\"...such sweet sorrow\\"   Thank you John Mayer. Your gift has made room for you and the rest of the world to enjoy. Priceless.
B001FSDOZO|2.0|Nickelback's lyrics get worse with every CD.  Maybe these 30 plus year old wanna-be frat boys should try consistantly writing songs about things that really matter.  I'm mystified by the \\"party all day and night till we can't stand up\\" songs that bookend the album and yet smack in the middle of the set is a song lamenting the OD death of a best friend. Go figure.  It's too bad because Mutt Langes' production is sonically perfect.
B0019IB26I|5.0|\\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\\" Priceless Gem.   Get the DVD and enjoy it with friends. You will all be enriched by the experience of seeing a new rising son of guitar and music.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Yes I appreciate all you technical people who disect an album probably before you have listened to it at least 10 times which is IMO a true requirement.  Maybe you should apply for Siskel and Eiberts jobs!  Come on.  Look I voted for this guy and after hearing Archie's cd I am happy with my vote cuz he truly treated us (adults) and not just try to treat the teeny boppers in which Archie did a bit but not completely.  (IMO)<br /><br />1 Cookie was not quite as soulful as I thought he would be.  I thought he would be because of Billie Jean, Hello, First Time I Saw Your Face and Eleanor Rigby on the show.  I FELL IN LOVE in an astronomical degree and lost my mind for him...jeez I was in Heaven.  Yet he did accomplish that ROCK/SOUL thing for me just not as much as I thought he would.  I'm ok with it though.<br /><br />2 My favorite cuts are: in no partiular order are Bar-Ba-Sol, A Daily Anthem/Kiss On My Neck (awesome i was lost altho I did not appreciate the almost 7 min wait for Kiss, I don't like this hidden track crap), Mr Sensitive just because again I got lost cleaning my house and it sounds good loud okay? I love him and his guitar and I know that's him yeah!  He could come play for me and I would lose my mind and cry.  Next is Lie cuz again it sounds good loud.  This cat is soooooooooooo much better than Daughtry IMO cuz he just ISSSSS!!  Next is I Did It for You with much of the same groove he has established but I am HAPPY and EXUBERANT cuz nothing has stepped in and turned me off.  When I learn the words I will be the happiest chick on the west siiiieeeeeeedddee. LOL!  Avalanche is a lil softer rock and that is great for me because I am a singer too.  I love to sing and this one makes me sing along in a boisterous fashion and THANK GOD I don't have nearby neighbors that would call the police on me!  This track is a singer's song!  Permanent only emphasizes what I just said about Avalanche.<br /><br />3 My final comments on this fab 5 cd is that it SWALLOWED Daughtry and my other rock fave Bo (Gawd I flub him too) AND LIKE MARY on SYTYCD I give this CD a Mighty mIGHTY screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeech......<br /><br />People do not hesitate to buy this Rich and Soulful Rock CD because it will not disappoint and I just wanna shout out: \\"I LOVE YOU COOKIE--YOU DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000YENUI6|1.0|Apart from Viggo Mortensen, this movie is a waste of time. If they had acted it just a bit more over the top, it would have been a fine dark comedy. As it is, it's just dull and unrealistic. The violence is graphic and lurid, but doesn't add much to theme or plot. I felt it was gratuitous. If you want to see a much better movie about Russian mob life, try either \\"Brat\\" (Brother), \\"Brat II\\", or \\"Friend of the Deceased\\" (Ukrainian film). These three films have a lot more to say about life in the criminal trades, and just being human, than \\"Eastern Promises\\". Most of the plot line is just totally unrealistic.
B001F3DY9A|5.0|I probably am just off the target demographic for this album.  As a late 20s female, I'm a bit older than the high school girl who will closely related, but I can at least listen and remember what it was like.  The songs are straight from her diary, which is what I enjoy about the album.  It is her real life experience as a teenage girl.  She isn't attempting to write about things she doesn't know.  Instead she pours her heart out about a crush on a friend, how when you are you you have THAT song as a couple and even later it reminds you of that time in your life, and sneaking out of the house.  It's fun, it bring back memories, and she sings it all with a beautiful and mature voice.  I've been listening to it for over a year and I'm still not tired of it.
B001CZVVUU|4.0|What a difference blu-ray makes!  If there was ever a production of an opera to want in stunning high defintion, it may be this one, and DG does not disappoint.  The colors leap off the screen and the beautiful cast, costumes and scenery are just a feast to behold.  The DTS-HD track is very good for the most part, occasionally the singers feel too close and there are occasional balance issues, but it is excellent for the most part.      There has been a lot written about this production.  I saw it in LA a few years ago and was blown away then.  I'm very grateful to see it here on BD/DVD, but I feel there's something missing.  As amazing as Netrebko and Villazon are, there is something missing from their relationship here in this production.  I feel like the McVicar production (also with Rolando) with Dessay shows much more tenderness and intense subtlety in the first sparks of romance when Manon and Des Grieux first meet.  I'm not discounting the validity of the awkward teenager to passionate affair vision in the Patterson production here, but I think for me the McVicar approach is preferable and ends up being a bit more touching in the ending demise.  Of course, with Patterson's vision of Manon's life as a movie starlet, a touch more superficiality may be what he wanted!    In any case, this BD of this opera is a feast for the eyes and ears.  If you know Netrebko's singing, you know that the lightness and fluidity of tone required by Manon are not her strong suit.  If that is not an issue for you, then have no reservations and enjoy!

B001GQACGO|3.0|I've been a Destiny's Child & Beyonce fan & supporter for 10 years so I know their music.   Therefore I am not a 'hater' just for having this opinion.  I have to say I'm totally disappointed in this album.   I wasn't expecting another B'Day or Dangerously & I actually liked her new sound from what I had already heard.  But most of the songs chosen are slow & quite frankly sound too similar.   I was annoyed as hell as well that there's yet another Deluxe Edition, when she could've put good quality songs onto one disc.  I don't get the whole Beyonce/Sasha thing either, since there's no real definition between the two.  Songs like Upgrade U & Ring The Alarm from B'Day were more Sasha-ish  I was reading other's reviews too, & they quite rightly said it's more about the money these days.  I refuse to buy a re-release of any album & that's something Beyonce seems to be doing a lot of.  Her unreleased songs that she didn't use for this album were better, & should've been included instead of some of the others.  Her cheating/relationship songs are overdone, she should focus now on something else.  The only thing I did love was the fact that Jay Z's not anywhere on this record!  I'll probably still go on the tour as a fan, but don't expect front row seats from me!
0375505091|3.0|A Photographer's Life 1990-2005 is a complex set of images taken by Annie Leibovitz.  For Leibovitz the book represents a way to cope with the death of both her father and her lover, Susan Sontag.  It is a large and deeply personal set of images that spanned traumatic family events and love lost.  Famous for her commercial portraits of Michael Jordan, Yoko Ono, John Lennon, and Bruce Springstein, Leibovitz uses a variety of techniques in this book, ranging from snap shots to well composed images filled with set lighting.   I have a strong appreciation for the book's layout, from single images spread over two pages to small scans of medium format slides applied directly to the page.  One of my favorite compositions was a contact sheet of her daughter as she ran around on a spring day.    In the end, though, the layout of the book was chaotic.  Though this did convey the complexity of a photographer's entire life, and not just one body of work, it was a huge distraction.  Annie Leibovitz's tried to portray her grief through this layout; it conveys chaos and a sense of despaire.  She was thinking more about herself than what viewers would think as they flipped through the book.  A page depicting a deeply haunting scene from Rwanda, would be followed by a portrait.  Leibovitz could have solved this chaos with some organization, quite possibly through chapters from year to year and strict chronology or even better, the separation of editorial, personal, and commercial work.  I personally would have preferred to see her photos divided in accordance to subject matter, which I think would strengthen the essence of her work.
0143036742|3.0|One of the characters, Valentina, is actually sort of awful and teeters on the edge of being a caricature, but then it is hard to portray characters with a less-than-perfect mastery of English without them sounding either a little simplified or larger than life. One gripe I had was that the first person narrator seems to be almost omnipresent, the author sometimes seeming to be pulling back to correct herself with \\"at least this is how my father told it\\" or something of that sort. At times the prose was a little clunky, while other passages were very nicely done.    Around halfway through I was rather forcing myself to continue with the book for the sake of completion, but that said at a later point I was gripped and eager to discover the fate of various characters. The last third of the book was very absorbing, and I would have liked to have known more about why the narrator developed her obsession to follow Valentina.    Overall original and quite entertaining....
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I have been so pumped since the day that David Cook told us fans that the album would make the hair on our necks raise up. I can easily say that I was blown away when I heard this release. The songs are intelligently written, and the sound is clearly related to David Cook. Rob Cavallo (his producer) did a great job with creating the David Cook signature sound.    Now, a lot of people may not like this type of rock music. David told us on American Idol at his audition that he \\"brings something different to the table\\". There is no doubt in my mind that this rock record is brilliantly different than your average mainstream sound (ie Daughtry, The Calling, Hoobastank, etc). This debut is just one chapter out of the legacy of David Roland Cook.    Declaration- a very mainstream stand out track. It shows how David can easily belt out those notes with ease, and make them sound silky smooth.    Heroes- another mainstream track, which has a terrific chorus. I tip my hat to David on this one for hitting those hard to reach notes for a male vocalist.    Light on- This track is obviously going to be an arena rock hit. The sound is quite different from the rest of the album. We see that \\"david cook crunch\\" face in the video.    Come Back to Me- A very interesting acoustic type ballad. Really takes a toll on one's mind. It's clearly suits David Cook well.    Life on The Moon- Another suited David Cook sound and song.    I Did It for You- a mainstream song that should be used in a movie.    Basically ladies and gentlemen, this is a great, refreshing debut from David Cook. I have listened to the album multiple times before giving my review. If I could have anyone's vocal ability, it would be David Cook's. His ability is so flexible, but yet so raw and untouchable, and rather difficult to remake.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Another excellent album by Ray Lamontagne, his third.  His first, Trouble, though still more than worth the money, was at times inconstent.  He hit a home run with his second album, \\"Till the Sun Turns Black,\\" a magnificent collections of songs.  Not even a so-so one in the bunch.  With \\"Gossip in The Grain,\\" he's gone a step up.  Intelligent, insightful lyrics, mesmerizing melodies, and just the right amount of rasp to his voice to really show off the emotion.  Actually, though, I think the weakest song on the album is the first song.  I burned a copy, moving the 1st to last, and I prefer it much more that way.  My oppinion.  But there's no doubt, it's an album worth owning -- played in any order.

B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and really enjoyed it. I couldn't wait to get it on DVD. I was not disappointed.    The disc came with four 3D glasses and a widescreen and pan and scan 2D version and a Widescreen 3D version. I only have a small TV and I was still able to enjoy the 3D effects.    If you've missed this movie in the theater, the plot centers around Trevor Anderson and his nephew Sean. When the two discover that seismic activity has been detected in Iceland, they set out to investigate.    Aided by their mountain guide, they come into a cavern and find themselves falling into the Center of the Earth. Here they find all kinds of wonders that was described by Jules Verne in his novel including giant mushrooms, birds that glow and a T-Rex.    In the meantime they must find a way to return to the surface before the temperature at the center reaches the boiling point.    The Special Features include a featurette on Josh Hutcherson, the making of the movie, as well as two games that you can play with your remote.    This is one of the movies I truly enjoyed.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|It's hard to hate on an American Idol winner when said winner is dyed-in-the-wool Midwestern rocker David Cook. He cruised to a fairly dominant victory over standard-pop crooner David Archuleta with his nicotine-stained, husky vocals, his bar-rocker good looks, and most importantly, his ability to actually play guitar and create some truly out-of-left-field arrangements of songs. Cook's first album after winning Idol, and his second overall, is what you would expect from his offerings on the show, a collection of modern-rock tunes that are carried mostly on Cook's strong voice and owe quite a lot to Cook's own idols. Alas, the creative ingenuity Cook showcased on Idol in covering pop classics has been overwhelmed here, replaced by radio-ready, meat-and-potatoes rock `n roll that is entertaining, solid, and, too often, surprisingly bland.<br /><br />Unlike most of the champions who came before him, credit must be given to Cook for penning much of the material on his self-titled, and while he can at times wax sentimental like on the sappy \\"Heroes,\\" his arrangements and lyrics are what you would expect from a new alt-rock hero with the ambition to become an \\"American Our Lady Peace.\\" Single \\"Light On,\\" co-written with that Seattle rock god Chris Cornell, is your typical late `90s power ballad, while opener \\"Declaration\\" is hook-y guitar-heavy grunge-pop, and Cook's voice is the driving engine behind each song, lending appropriate gravitas and pathos at times and just sounding like he's having a ton of fun at others. Just check out the gritty, thudding rock of \\"Bar-Ba-Sol,\\" easily one of the best songs and vocal performances on the record.<br /><br />Cook still has a ways to go when it comes to making smart creative decisions, as the embarrassing metaphorical conceit \\"Life On The Moon\\" shows, and some songs just end up sounding too much like generic Nickelback-esque contemporary rock, like the uninspired \\"Mr. Sensitive\\" and the corny \\"I Did It For You.\\" The best songs are those that don't come off as sounding like they just rolled off the latest major-label rock assembly line, most notably the affecting \\"Permanent,\\" which glides along on a haunting piano and strings line and Cook's intimate lyrics. And Cook's own \\"A Daily AntheM\\" ends out the album on a powerful note, a truly ripping guitar solo that I almost couldn't believe coming from the mild-mannered Cook closing out a fairly rockin' tune.<br /><br />David Cook is easily one of the best debut albums to come out from the American Idol series, disdaining cookie-cutter pop and an anonymous hit team of writers, instead focusing the attention on its star's distinctive vocals and a rebellious image that Idol definitely needed. While much of the record still sounds a little too over-produced, a little too slick, and a little out-of-touch with progressive alt-rock, it bodes well for Cook's burgeoning career and a number of tracks give hope for a more original future beyond that of a Daughtry sound-a-like.n't come off as sounding like they just rolled off the latest major-label rock assembly line, most notably the affecting \\"Permanent,\\" which glides along on a haunting piano and strings line and Cook's intimate lyrics.

0316017922|5.0|First, full disclosure: I know Malcolm Gladwell. He was a guest speaker in my course \\"Creativity and Personal Mastery\\" at Columbia Business School and he held my class spellbound. I LOVE his pieces in the New Yorker and his earlier books.<br /><br />Gladwell uses the same technique in writing and speeches, and it is a hugely effective technique. He begins by presenting an intriguing fact, a VERY intriguing fact. He then presents a bunch of other, equally riveting, related facts so we now have a very fascinating theme. He then lays out some obvious possible explanations and knocks them down. He follows up by presenting some not-so-obvious-but-still-plausible explanations and knocks them down. And, finally, he presents the \\"real\\" reason and bolsters his case. Usually, but not always, this reason seems indisputable when he is done with his explanation.<br /><br />In Outliers he begins by noting that immigrants from a particular Italian city have remarkably low rates of heart disease. He proposes and knocks down several possible explanations like diet, exercise, genetics etc. before honing in on his explanation and I won't spoil the book for you by giving this away.<br /><br />I have a Ph.D. in Marketing and spent years as a professional market researcher so I am quite qualified to comment on his assertions. From the standpoint of rigorous experimental design his explanations fall down. There are numerous intervening variables that have not been considered or even identified. Some of the reviews have attacked him on this score. All of them have missed the point.<br /><br />Gladwell never professes to give you revealed truth. To fault him for this is silly. What he does do, time and again, is to give you a point of view that you had probably never considered. He stretches your mind and gives you the same feeling of awe stout Cortez felt when gazing on the Pacific Ocean for the first time. THAT is the real value of his books. And he has a damnably engaging style of writing.<br /><br />In Outliers he makes the case that in many fields - ice hockey, computer programming, law, mathematics, business - our traditional notions of inherent talent are flawed. Other explanations, and again I won't give the game away by revealing these, are more powerful and likelier to be \\"true\\".<br />He makes his case so compellingly that you feel amazed that you never thought of it. He would have made a great trial lawyer.<br /><br />So get this book and enjoy it. Just don't think of it as the ultimate answer for any of the complex issues he considers. Even though non-fiction it is a page turner and there are copious notes at the back for those who wish to explore further.<br /><br />There are occasional factual errors. For example, he asserts that only Bobby Fischer became a chess grandmaster in less than ten playing years. Sergey Karjakin, Parimarjan Negi and Magnus Carlsen all did it in less time than Fischer and remain the three youngest persons to reach that level. However, such errors are few and in no way detract from his theses.ase that in many fields - ice hockey, computer programming, law, mathematics, business - our traditional notions of inherent talent are flawed.

B00000I41J|5.0|Well, this is everything jazz should be, in this novice listener's opinion. Subdued in the right places, swinging in others, the supergroup Adderley put together for this album is simply astounding. Miles Davis and Adderley take center stage, but Hank Jones has some quality moments, and Sam Jones and Art Blakey provide a steady, if subdued, backbeat. I'd like to hear Blakey a little louder in the mix, but that's a small quibble.    The album may be a bit too conservative for those with particularly experimental tastes, nothing truly innovative seems to be going on here, but everything is in its proper place and is a wonderful starting point for those interested in exploring a burgeoning jazz infatuation, like myself.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I had never heard of this show nor actor before until it came on CBS due to the writer's strike last year and a friend told me I should watch it.  Glad that I took her advice.  I love the whole series.  I bought the DVDs and keep me on edge even though I had seen some on TV.  The ice-truck killer is one of the best cases and it keeps people guessing.  It also keeps the viewer guessing about Dexter's past which he cannot remember until it is almost too late.  No one can play this role better than Michael C. Hall.  Another actor in there who plays a doctor looks like Chris Sarandon so any fans of his will love this as well.  But I highly recommend this show.

0143038583|5.0|The author does an excellent job of explaining how ethics, policy, biology, culture and big business are connected and have shaped the foods that we eat today.  Many of our eating habits in the Western diet simply do not make sense and ultimately have global repurcussions.    The author raises many good questions without sounding moralistic or judgemental.  Why eat imported organic produce from a foreign country if the shipper burns huge quanitities of fossil fuels to deliver it to you?  Why continue to feed cattle corn when their stomachs cannot digest it?  Can we really say a food product has \\"natural raspberry flavor\\" when the flavor is actually derived from corn?    I enjoyed this author's writing style so well that I will likely buy his other book, \\"In Defense of Food\\".
B001C3KCSY|5.0|This is an excellent album. The highlights for me include \\"sex on fire\\", \\"manhattan\\", \\"revelry\\", and \\"notion\\". Caleb's vocals have never sounded better, and the rest of the band is outstanding here, especially the bassist. Sure they may have \\"sold out\\", but with melodies as good as are on display here, who cares? I'm not sure this is their best album though, their previous album \\"because of the times\\" is an absolute classic. Nevertheless,I would recommend any fan of rock music to buy this and you won't be disappointed. I can promise you that.

B001EO2UKO|5.0|Dido's songs from her past two albums have followed me for almost 10 years now. I think I know them all by heart, and I feel like they've become some sort of friends to whom I can turn to in every situation. When I travel, when I'm sad, when I'm in a good mood, when I drive. I don't have a particular kind of music I listen to all the time, but I \\"have\\" have a few artists who deeply touch me with both their music and their lyrics.   Needless to say, I had huge expectations for that third album. I must say, 'Safe Trip Home' fullfills every single one of them.   It is a great pleasure to listen again to her sweet, light voice, and her adorable British accent. But it actually goes beyond that. I have found the singer I always liked, but there is definitely something new in this album. More rythm maybe, more emotions. But it remains quite hard to identify. Exactly as it is hard to identify why her music is so enjoyable. Some of the songs in this album are just pure wonders. Like \\"Us 2 little little gods\\" or \\"The things we normally do'. Some are pure Dido material, like 'Look no further'. She put some beautiful arrangements, violons, piano.   I'm thankful for all these songs that are probably going to follow me for many many years again.

I've got to say 'Thank You' to James, Kirk, Lars, this guy named Rick Rubin and everyone involved in bringing back Metallica. My band Metallica has neglected me for a long time and I've survived this long quiet time. I've had lots of quiet time in the past 15 years or ... maybe more... it's been really quiet. Did I mention how quiet it's been? This CD is not quiet. It's LOUD. It's Metallica. The perfect example is the chaos at the end of `The Day that Never Comes' into the perfection of the intro of `All Nightmare Long'. That's the only way I can explain the feeling I get when I listen to this band at their best.     I stuck with them through some really quiet times, but geez, wouldn't ya know it? This one is SO loud that people are noticing the clipping of the recording. I can agree a little. Ya maybe they could've mastered this one better. My question to those who complain: When was the last time you listened to Ride The Lightning? It wasn't the best sounding master recording was it? It was really well written tho, right??? Some complain the chord progressions and chords are too familiar. Well--- you just can't please EVERYBODY now can you?     I'm really good with this one. I shall say my thanks one more time for so much less QUIET TIME!!

I was a fan from the Tom Baker days, and after college pretty much forgot about the Doctor until this past July.     The difference in special effects, stories, casting and overall packaging of the show is the difference between the original Flash Gordon B/W films and Star Trek TNG- not to say the Who series suffered terribly from low budgets- the stories and the characters were what really caught you, wasn't it then?- but it was great to see modern CGI effects and a bigger budget for sets and music elevating the Doctor series to its present glorious heights.    Solid writing, great callbacks to earlier series, and just a wonderful exploration of the Doctor's character and his companions is outstanding- Only the Davros at heart can be disappointed!
B001ED7C58|4.0|After my friend's teens practically threw the first Twilight book at me I was hooked. And after reading the third I was psyched to hear that a movie was coming out for the first book. As for the soundtrack for the movie it has a few good songs that go with it but some just don't do it for me. I love Paramore so I was really excited to hear they had the lead song and then even more later to hear they had another on it as well. The song by Rob is kinda hard to understand to me.. I have yet to find the lyrics online somewhere. Maybe if I knew all he was singing I would get it more. I love Rob but I never expected his voice to sound like that. I still don't know if I like it or not. Bella's lullaby wasn't what I had in mind. I envisioned just the piano but for a movie I guess they have to play it up a bit but the orchestra added didn't do it for me. Maybe minus it.. We'll see what it's in the movie. It's the only part in the movie I really hope is done good(in my eyes at least). The song, Go All The Way (Into The Twilight) by Perry Farrell is just funny and goes along with the movie and the series in a whole so well I love it! Even though it's upbeat the lyrics fit to me. About meeting for the first time, happy days coming, sparkles and lightning striking(baseball!) and of course going into 'twilight.' It's my favorite after the Paramore songs. Linkin Park is another of my favorite bands and Leave Out All the Rest is all Edward. Overall I'm happy with the soundtrack but I'd have liked to some different songs. I give it 4 stars regardless because it's still good even though not all I envisioned specifically for this movie.
B001AQO41E|4.0|This movie has a fond place in my heart, and the Blu-Ray release did not disappoint.  Although more extras would have been nice,  the picure and sound quality are excellent.  Highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the movie.
0670020745|5.0|It is a very good book related to the stoke caregivers.  It has a lot of information related to recovery and get help.
B001AQR3E4|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I absolutely ADORE this film...my rating is for the BluRay transfer and presentation ONLY.  This version SUCKS...especially for THIRTY BUCKS.  Only a couple of moments in the Theatres des Vampires appear slightly crisp and refined, the rest is no better than the standard DVD.  'IWTV' deserved better than this rubbish.  Shame on you Warner Bros., you did a FANTASTIC job on The LoSt BoYS but on this film you dropped the ball.      AND GET NEW DVD EXTRAS FROM THIS DECADE!  THEY ARE LO-DEF AND TIRED LOOKING!    Don't waste your money.
1416594884|3.0|Recently it came to light that John LeCarre considered defecting to the Soviets while in the British government's service. In this book he continues deeper on his politically left-driven agenda, and I must say it cheapens his otherwise classic prose.    If you think of this piece as coming from Putin's poisoned publishers, then you might relax and enjoy it, with your intellectual shotgun by your side, that is.
B001GQO50I|5.0|This is a really good cd in all respects, the sound is exceptional for a live recording from the 60's.  I disagree with the reviewers who state that this is for die hard fans. Listen to the second cd, it's unbelievable.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|You should buy this CD! This is a must buy for all...First of all this isnt your everday rock CD...this is,from the opening track, Something in your Mouth...till the last one..This Afternoon..a musical adventure!  This offering from the men hailing from Canada is amazing...Great lyrics trembling guitar rifts...awesome lead vocals..haunting background vocals..Thunderous drum beats..intermixed keyboards...it's got it all  ballads and pump your fist rockers..It's fun yet serious..It does what music is supposed to do...get in your Pysche..let you latch on the coattails of somebody who's talented enough to put it all out there and let us ride along as they take us on a musical journey...Just don't judge this CD based on there last CD..judge it on it's own..So buy it,put in on and hold the heck on!
B001GQSY64|2.0|I'm a Star Wars fan; which is to say I'm a fan of the original franchise before Lucas sold out and began making the films for merchandising rights and placed profit before storytelling. This is one more example, but I'll be more objective and base this review on content not bias.    In terms of the timeline, this takes place between episodes 2 & 3, but it undermines the Cartoon Networks animated Clone Wars cartoon (which was very well done). In the cartoon, Anakin is still a padawan but eventually becomes a Jedi and the timeline leads up literally to the opening scenes of episode 3. So where does this fit in? It doesn't.    In terms of characters, Anakins padawan is introduced. What padawan? Good question. There's never been a reference to Anakin ever having a padawan. Not in episode 3, not in the cartoon, not in the books. Nowhere. The character herself is an annoying, disrespectful, sophomoric twit. You can argue that Anakin was undisciplined, but Anakin didnt grow up in the Jedi Temple. She's the Jar Jar of the show. The only good thing is knowing that she must die before episode 3.    The animation is fine for TV, but it should never have been released in the theater, As a precursor to the series it works, aside from the fact that it never happened.     The best part of the movie/series are the clones themselves. This really shows them as people and individuals as opposed to the human robots we've come to see tham as. The entire movie and series would have worked better if it had been entirely from the point of view of the troopers, with the Jedi being secondary characters. That would have eliminated any undermining of the storyline, which is what Lucas ended up doing.
B00133KFGW|3.0|I wish Freddie Highmore was a better actor, otherwise I could have really fallen for this picture in a big way, but perforce the screenplay had to keep returning from more interesting byways to focus on August's plight, and my heart sank each time.  Funny thing too, for I used to like seeing Freddie in his other films: maybe he just isn't up to this particular part, for all he does here is widen his eyes with inexpressible delight every time he hears *music,* and then, as if that wasn't enough, those eyes widen further every time he hears mere *sound.*  Nick Castle, the screenwriter, is always bad with kids: he is the madman responsible for HOOK and also he directed the horrid movie version of DENNIS THE MENACE and should have been exiled to Neptune for those crimes.  And sorry, little Freddie just doesn't look like he could possibly be the son of Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.<br /><br />Speaking of which, for me the picture lost dramatic plausibility the minute rich girl Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) lays eyes on emo musician Louis Connelly (Rhys Meyers) in the shadow of Washington Square Arch.  He invites her to climb up and sit by him.  Sorry, if he were the last man on earth you wouldn't catch me sitting on a high parapet next to Jonathan Rhys Meyers, I'd be too afraid he'd just tip me over the side of the building.  ANY stranger, but especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  There's something sinister and creepy about him, though maybe Lyla's drawn to him because of a similar streak in her own father (Bill Sadler, the sheriff from ROSWELL), who has a strange fixation on her that leads to terrible consequences.<br /><br />I kept thinking there must have been scenes deleted from the movie, scenes covering the character arc of little Arthur (Leon Thomas III), whom we first see as the prize prodigy of crazy Wizard (Robin Williams), busking in Washington Square Park like a tiny rock star.  As the film progresses, it's rather like ALL ABOUT EVE, with Evan Taylor/August Rush gradually supplanting poor Arthur in Wizard's affections, and becoming super famous and desired, while Arthur just stands there looking glum.  Does he resent the white boy's success?  Is it a parable for American race relations--August even gets to keep the very guitar Arthur once played?  I think so, but it's almost as if they wanted to keep this aspect of the film muted--and in general, black children AND adults are nothing but helpful and kind to the lad of mysterious origins, August Rush, even saving his life on more than one occasion.  This must be why poor Terrence Howard (whom I hope they paid a huge sum to) gets to appear in the film as the helpful, kind social worker.  When you see him, your heart swells with sympathy, feeling sorry for the man who was once going to be the next big thing in the movies, and now he's playing a distant second or third fiddle to Freddie Highmore, sob.supplanting poor Arthur in Wizard's affections, and becoming super famous and desired, while Arthur just stands there looking glum.

0439813786|5.0|This book is nothing less than brilliant.<br /><br />To read this book is an EXPERIENCE that goes above and beyond what previously I considered reading to be. This is not your typical book. The reader experiences this book; they do not just read this book in the usual manner.<br /><br />This is not a traditional children's book filled with words. This is not a purely graphic novel told comic book style with bubbles of dialogue, nor is it a graphic book filled only with wordless images. The author plays with the storytelling medium, using a combination of pages filled with only illustration alternating with pages of text. The illustrations don't compliment the text as is typical with most children's books; instead the illustrations actually take the place of the text and tell the story. You can't ignore the illustrations as you can with some other books as you'd miss some of the story, the reader has to rely on the illustration to tell that portion of the story. You won't want to rush through or ignore the illustrations, because the pencil drawings are very well done and the tones set the mood and even convey action (which surprised me as most of my reading has been with text-only books). I was repeatedly surprised when the page was turned and an illustration was there informing me of the action, instead of words. Additionally, the timing of the page turning and the spacing of the text on the page create a tension and add to the suspense and action. While my eyes wanted to rush ahead to read the next words, I had to wait and turn the page to reveal what would happen next.<br /><br />This book is something superior and fantastic that the term \\"juvenile fiction book\\" just does not describe adequately. I don't think the book publishing industry has a word for a book like this yet. To my knowledge there is no other book quite like this on published for children (and adults like me who enjoy reading children's books). I can only hope that more well-written books will be published like this and then the book publishing industry will have to invent a new name for what this is!<br /><br />This is definitely a book that anyone (young or old) can easily step into and escape into the story. It hooks you in, and the fast pace and steady action creates a roller coaster ride that makes the reader not want to put the book down until it is finished.<br /><br />For those reasons this is a perfect book for reluctant readers, especially boys. If this story can't pull a reader in then I don't know one that will.<br /><br />Some notes about the book's layout are worth noting as some customers will find these worthy reasons to consider buying this book. There is a good amount of white space on many pages and the pages have a black border. Although most people may not care about either of those things, they are relevant as it is said that particular layout helps children with a visual processing learning disorder, those with an eye tracking problem. It also is said to help dyslexic children, who can for some reason, read words on a page when there is a border around the edge of the page. The book is thick and imposing to young readers, yet the story can be read quickly and this may help some children who have a fear of reading a book that is thick or who may think they are incapable of reading a heavy hard cover book.<br /><br />As to what kind of kids may like this book, the subject of an invention and a robotic man told in a suspenseful way is appealing to many young boys who don't often find those subjects (robots, inventions) in fiction books, but of course, kids who like robots and inventors would be drawn to the book. Since a girl is the secondary character, girls may like this book also. Actually this is the type of book that readers will enjoy even if they usually don't have a personal interest in that topic, similar, for example, to those of us who may enjoy a movie drama set in a sports team when we are not passionate about that sport. Thatis because a good story touches our heart and reels us in. (I would not be surprised if someone wants to make a movie adaptation of this story.)<br /><br />Besides the enjoyment of the story, beyond the excitement and the pleasure of reading it, there are worthwhile themes in the book. Finding one's purpose in life and doing work that one loves instead of work to pay the bills is one of them. A good work ethic is promoted (early stealing receives negative consequences and is not glorified). The negativity that can come when one stifle's one's creativity, how art made by one person can influence and inspire others in their own creative path and can segue into their life's work is in the book. Valuing a child who is mechanically inclined and good with his hands is seldom a trait in children's literature, but it is in this story. The value of reading books in one's spare time for pleasure, inspiration, and for learning information is demonstrated throughout. (The drawings of the overloaded stacks in the used book shop will be enjoyed by book lovers.) The fact that self-directed learning outside of school can and does take place with children is an important element in the book. The book also has obvious themes of trust, generosity, friendship and unconditional love. The value of a formal education as well as learning outside of school and following one's passion in life is underscored.<br /><br />The book is based on some real facts but the characters and the information about the creator of the automaton are purely fictional, as is explained in the end notes. There is a link in the end note to view videos on the Internet of the original automaton which was built in the year 1810! The book also touches on filmmaking and the early days of filmmaking. Children with an interest in those subjects may especially enjoy this story as well. Real facts about the history of filmmaking are in the book.<br /><br />Some who appreciate my book reviews like to hear of content that may be troublesome to their children, especially sensitive children. I understand that no exciting story can exist without some kind of problem; this one has a few that might upset some readers. Amazon prohibits spoilers in customer reviews, so I'll share general information. This book has two orphaned children, death by fire, and death by drowning, alcoholism, and stealing including forcing the main character to steal. With all that said I need to clarify that much of that is `back story' that is briefly mentioned in the book or the action in the story is so intense that we gloss over new bits of negative information, as they are not delved into deeply enough to elicit a strong reaction of upsetting children (unless the child is very sensitive to those issues). If you worry about this for your child, I would urge you to read the book first, as it is such a great book. Then you can be the judge if the book is appropriate for your child at their present age.<br /><br />The last thing I'll share is the book was so loved by my eleven year old son that he fell asleep reading it in bed at night, and finished it in the morning before he got out of bed, so it was finished within a 24 hour window of time. I read the book in about two hours and loved it.s in. (I would not be surprised if someone wants to make a movie adaptation of this story.)

B0014DZ2VO|5.0|Saw it in the theater--Another great Bond movie and Daniel Craig's 2nd 007 flick.  There is lots of action, as usual with Bond.  I didn't think I would like Craig as a Bond guy until his first Bond flick, but he does a great job and so do the writers.  Craig actually gets beat up a little when he gets in scuffles and the stunts are toned down just a little to make them a little more reasonable.<br /><br />This movie had the charachters in Siena Italy, Austria, Talmone Italy, Bolivia, Russia, and I think there may have been a stop in Haiti (not sure about Haiti).  It begins with a car chase through the mountains in Italy.  There is some beautiful scenery and Bond lives to fight in another movie.  Bond and \\"M\\" have some tension, as is often usual.  Great flick.  Worth buying when it hits the DVD racks.
B000GPI2EK|4.0|One of the best metal albums I have bought in a few years, totally non commercial, not poppy,  metal at it's finest.  Very unique sound, so much so that I can't really compare Mastodon to anyone else.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes metal and/or hard rock.
B001GQACGO|2.0|I was so excited to grab this album, since I'm a devoted fan to B's work.  But after listening to the first few couple of songs to CD 1.. it bored me to death.  Why are all the songs slow? The only songs I enjoyed listening to were \\"Halo\\" and \\"If I were a Boy\\".  The rest were crap. CD 2 did a bit better, I enjoyed \\"Single Ladies\\", \\"Diva\\", and \\"Videophone\\"  Everything else was weak.  I have to say this is by far the worse CD Beyonce has come out with. With my budget being so tight, I didn't feel I got my moneys worth with this purchase. If your contemplating on buying this album, I would recommend listening to clips of each song & to purchase the songs individually.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This album made people stand up and realize the beast is in town..<br /><br />Buy it its awesome
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|each of the 12 tracks on this cd are wonderful. the problem is they don't make a very cohesive body of work, there for, the album as a whole suffers. i've been an enya fan for a long, long time. i can appreciate her work and be open-minded about whatever she puts out there, as well as many other enya fan out there. but people who are not familiar with her music will find this album incredibly boring and ever intolerable. for them almost all of these tracks will sound exactly the same. the first half of the album gets it right, balancing beautiful, heavenly slow-tempo songs (\\"journey of the angels\\", \\"o come, o come, emmanuel\\")with more up-tempo and lively pieces. (\\"white is in the winter night\\", \\"trains and winter rains\\")  the album loses it in the second half. tracks 6-10 are ALL slow-tempo quiet ballads that to the untrained ear sound almost exactly the same. at this point many people will be pressing the skip button over and over again. and, granted, the penultimate track on the album (\\"my! my! time flies!\\") is the loudest, most bombastic track on this album, and on any other enya album, but it comes to late to break the monotony.   if you're a fan of enya, you'll definitely enjoy this album and these finely-crafted songs, but for those who are unfamiliar or vaguely interested in her her music i cannot recommend this latest offering from her.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|I'm very late in doing a review here. As a big fan of movies I have decided only just recently to start posting reviews (look for my first on 'DETERRENCE'). Batman Begins is so cooooooool. It destroyed all those cheeeezy films made before about Batman, especially when each one is played by a different actor, (nothing worse than sequels that do that) and they were just s**t anyway.  Christian Bale is first class. Being English I shocked myself when I first realised he was English, (not American) he's an actor I'm not too familiar with but he is a true pro. Loved the movie, even Micheal Caine and I don't even like him, sorry Micheal, no offense. Morgan Freeman speaks for himself along with Gary Oldman, (Hhmm... an array of English actors here). All in all a first class movie. I especially loved the martial arts training scenes, it's one of those moments where you want to do it yourself. 5 star effort, no question about it. I will start now, after years of movie collecting and following, to post reviews. I am in a position to easily set up a contraversial website on movie debates, I'd love that and would challenge anyone on their points of view. let me know what you think and I will reply accordingly.  agent.cross@yahoo.co.uk   Look forward to it.
1400031354|5.0|I'd never heard of Alexander McCall Smith until a few months ago when a friend recommended The Ladies # 1 Detective Agency. After reading it and becoming intrigued with Precious Ramotswe and her life in Botswana, I was eager to read the next book and find out what happened to this clever lady detective. Tears of the Giraffe was equally enjoyable, and I found myself chuckling aloud at some of the situations described by Smith. For instance, the scene in which Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is caught \\"red handed\\" as he and the children are finishing a photo session is amusing. So is the image of the unscrupulous maid getting her just desserts.<br /><br />The author brings in some serious situations as well, and the reader will find her (or his) heart involved with the American woman in search of her son. Then there's the moral dilemma of the butcher and his fashionable wife and child. Precious and her secretary-turned-detective shrewdly solve these and other cases, and the developing love story between Precious and J.L.B. adds a delightful side story.<br /><br />.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Right now music critics everywhere are having a field day, because lets face it critics love to dwell on the negatives, and the band that everyone loves to hate has a new album out. That's right, Nickelback may get scathing critiques by so called \\"purists\\", but how much of it is deserved is questionable to say the least. I mean can you really tell me that crafting perfect pieces of radio friendly pop rock like these guys have for the past 7 years requires no talent? Well then lets see all these people go make a song that smashes it's way up the charts and appeals to a huge audience. Try that, and come back and tell me that it's not a skill. This band is very talented at what it does best, making music that catches the ear and makes you sing along.     \\"Dark Horse\\", the band's follow up to their massive 12 million worldwide seller \\"All the Right Reasons\\" sees the band going in a more rock oriented direction. While \\"All the Right Reasons\\" was roughly 75% pop, 25% rock, \\"Dark Horse\\" is pretty much the opposite. It works out great though, because as it turns out the band has the same knack for making radio friendly rock songs, as it they do for pop songs. You'd be hard pressed to find more sing aloud rockers than \\"Burn It to the Ground\\", \\"Something In Your Mouth\\", \\"S.E.X.\\", \\"Shakin Hands\\", and \\"Just To Get High.\\" And although the band succeeds when it comes to the music of these songs, even I have to criticize them for some of the lyrics. There's nothing wrong with adult oriented lyrics, but I do have a problem when half the songs sound like they were written by a horny 13 year old boy. Nickelback isn't making it easy on themselves with their critics here. \\"Dirty little lady, with the pretty pink thong\\", \\"She ain't no Cinderella when she's gettin' undressed, cause she rocks it like the naughty Wicked Witch of the West\\", and \\"We're gonna do it hangin' upside down\\" are just a few samples of some of the lyrics from these songs. It's a real shame, because as I said these are some catchy rock songs with great riffs, but anyone who's passed puberty is going to get tired of the immature lyric overload at some point.     Though not every rock song on here is like that, \\"Just To Get High\\" is an album high point (no pun intended), as lead singer Chad Kroeger sings about a friend's addiction to drugs and the repercussions, over rollicking guitar riffs and solos. \\"Burn It to the Ground\\" shows true shades of the album's producer, Mutt Lange with it's foot stomping, Def Leppard styled \\"We're going out tonight (hey!), to kick down every light(hey!)\\" chant along.     Of course there is still the pop rock songs on here the band is probably best known for. Lead single \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\" is up there with their best pop, and has very pleasant lyrics of finding your soulmate. I especially enjoy the verses on the song. \\"I'd Come For You\\" and \\"Never Gonna Be Alone\\" should satiate your power ballad fix, with great arena style harmonies, and love-struck lyrics. \\"If Today Was Your Last Day\\" rounds out the poppier songs, and is another sure fire hit, pertaining to what you would do if the titular question happened to you. And hey, there's even some country on the album's funnest track, \\"This Afternoon.\\" This ode to just kickin back and enjoying life is practically irresistible. If the label knows what they're doing they'll release this as a single next summer, and I guarantee it will be blaring out the speakers of cars everywhere.     All in all, \\"Dark Horse\\" is a great follow up to the pop/rock brilliance of \\"All the Right Reasons\\", marred only by some of the unnecessarily raunchy lyrics. It's nice to see the band establish themselves again as more of a rock act here, and Mutt Lange does a great job with the production of these tracks. Say what you want about Nickelback, but after 30 million sold worldwide, they are certainly no 'dark horse.' 4/5 Stars    My Top 5:  1. This Afternoon  2. Just To Get High  3. Gotta Be Somebody  4. Burn It to the Ground  5.If Today Was Your Last Day
B000003C2U|5.0|For all Heavy Metal fan out there this is a must nave CD... Its aggressive and real melodic..No gay parts at all.. I love it...
B0009S2T0M|5.0|the best revenge movie i've seen. watch it with subtitles though, the whole english dubbing ruines it in my opinion
B001GQACGO|5.0|I rarely write a review for a CD, but I just have to comment on some of the people rating this album.  Correct me if I wrong, but many of the people commenting on this project are just commenting on past experience with Beyonce albums and they do not understand what she was trying to do with this third CD.  They are saying things like this sounds nothing like Beyonce.  Of course it does not sound like typical Beyonce because that was her goal behind this project.  She wanted to sing different music this time around.  I think the keyword was something DIFFERENT.  If she wanted to repeat Dangerously in Love, she would have made Dangerously in Love Part 2.  If she wanted to repeat B'Day, she would have made B'Day Part 2.  She made 70 songs for this album, but only put songs on the album that meant something to her.  These songs have meaning for the artist and she is hoping that you can see why she placed these songs on the album.  Something that may seem like crap to you at first. . . press pause . . . then try to figure out why that song would have meaning for Beyonce.  Not necessarily for a mad fan who wishes she had a whole album of Crazy in Loves and Deja Vus.<br /><br />I even read another commented that stated, \\"I thought this was supposed to be Sasha Fierce, so what's up with all the slow songs?\\"  This person must have missed the point that the first album is Beyonce being vulnerable something we rarely see from her songs.  Which type of songs usually shows vulnerability?  Ballads show vulnerability very well; thus, that is why the first album has mainly ballads.  Sasha is not only fast music, but songs that show Beyonce's sexuality, emotional and her crazy side.  If she wants to talk about her man's EGO she can unleash that through Sasha.  If she wants to be ghettofab on tracks like DIVA (which is produced by the same guy who produced Lil' Wayne's \\"Milli,\\" thus, it is on purpose people!!!) and VIDEO PHONE she can unleash that through Sasha as well.<br /><br />Best songs on Disc 1:<br /><br />1.

B000784WMW|5.0|I like this adaptation of Jane Eyre very much and it was a great price!
B001GQACGO|4.0|I really love B, and I am one of those fans that truly believes that she is really the queen. But the Beyonce side is kind of cliche', dead, boring I should say. The only songs I actually like from that side is:    Halo  Disappear    Yeah, two out of the 8 songs on that side. I really like the Sasha side because she really shows how bad she is! lol! Like Bday, this cd will have to grow on me so for now I would suggest all the TRUE Beyonce fans to get it....eventually it will grow on you.

B001GQACGO|1.0|Beyonce's old material was a lot better  To me it sounds like she's trying too sound too much like Leona Lewis by deepening her voice for demanding songs  The only good song is Halo    Don't buy  Just download Halo    All other songs are waste of time
0780626966|5.0|This has always been one of my favourite series of horror, the one I could actually watch as a child and not be too scared.  Robert Englund does a wonderful job of bringing Freddy to life.  Nightmare 6 is the only let down which does not do justice to the series.  Joss used his great imagination to bring some of his childhood fears to the big screen.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I own all of Enya's albums and this is definitely one of my favorites. The music is so peaceful and relaxing. Only a few songs have a Christmas flavor.. the rest are typical relaxing music that Enya makes. I love this album and have it playing in the background for hours. Well worth the $10.00 dollars.
B001GQACGE|1.0|Beyonce sounds like she ruined/strained her voice too much for this CD  she's trying to sound like an old blusy/light R&B   she should be doing more songs like Deja Vu    The only good song was Halo...
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have been watching many high definition movies and this production is nothing less than spectacular.  We do not have the most advanced audio system but the sounds is great.  The scenes and the quality of video shooting is incomparable.  On top of all that, the subject is entrancingly interesting.  Must have? yep.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I have watched this movie many times.  I am very intrigued by the acting and how it different it compares to today's acting, the runway show, the styles, everything. Although, I'm pretty sure if my hubby cheated on me, we'd be done...otherwise, this is a movie right?  I loved it!
1595141979|5.0|A little background... I am in my mid 20's and a high school teacher who loves to read when I can but doesn't get much time to do it in. I picked up the twilight series a year ago at a students request and was pleasantly surprised. Once the series was finished I needed another one! Before Twilight I had not been into teen romance/ fantasy books especially with vampires and such. I saw a book-list of recommendations by Twilight followers and picked up the \\"House of Night\\" series by PC Cast. This was worth reading and I am waiting for the next book to come. My husband now calls me addicted to Vamps since I started looking for a new series to pick up. I was strongly recommended to pick up the Vampire Academy series by my 20 year old sister who has always been a fan of this genre of books.   Wow! I loved this series, I know I might get some backlash on this from serious twilighters out there but I would say this is a close second to twilight though it has a very different storyline/plot. I love the background Richelle Mead gives her characters even ones that don't seem to significant at first. Rose is an amazing self conflicted character to read about. A young but amazing heroine conflicted between her life duty/purpose to protect her best friend Lissa, a last in her family royal, or choose another \\"alluring\\" path. Rose is a woman coming into her own through the series having to deal with self conflictions while those around her often idolize her more than she likes. Oh, and the fact that there is a gorgeous & lethal male \\"mentor\\" named Dimitri in it doesn't hurt! In this latest installment things heat up between a few characters and hard decisions are made that will touch everyone in the long run.  I have enjoyed each of the books but \\"Shadow Kiss\\" is what I would call the best in series so far. It is longer, which is great for how fast I read, and for those of you who like a little adult content this book alludes to some in a tasteful way. This is the most \\"mature\\" book and has lots of action and some new characters who I find very interesting. I couldn't put this book down. I bought it the day it was released and finished it one day (reading in between classes and my lunch break). I love it when a book can grab me and by the end of the book make the story seem complete but at the same time still agonizing that the next book doesn't come out until late next year!    I hope this helps anyone looking into the series and if you already have read the first two there is no way you should pass this one up (as I said it's the best so far). Anyone out there who enjoyed the [[ASIN:0316031844 The Twilight Saga: Slipcased]] or [[ASIN:0312379838 Untamed (House of Night, Book 4)]] then I would highly recommend picking up the Vampire Academy series. I am not guaranteeing anything because as I tell my students \\"everyone has and is entitled to there own opinion\\", however I have run across students and adults alike who liked this genre and were not to impressed with Twilight but still found this series a great read. As I said before great for the teen as well as the adult in the family.  Best of Luck Book Hunting!
0312427646|5.0|Bennett is one of the very best comic writers presently working in the English language, and this short book -- only 120 pages -- will keep you thoroughly entertained for the few hours it takes to read it. The set-up is simple. Queen Elizabeth II, pursuing a corgi around the corner of Buckingham Palace one afternoon, encounters the bookmobile that supplies her staff with its reading on a weekly basis. Looking inside from curiosity, and startling the librarian and the young man from the kitchen staff patronizing the collection, her natural politeness drives her to check out a book. Having done so, she feels duty-bound (duty being something Her Majesty understands thoroughly) to actually read it. And the experience is transformative. So begins her amazed discovery of an entirely new world she never really knew existed -- the world of literature. And Norman, the young kitchen skivvy (well, he is gay), becomes her guide and amanuensis. Her first approach to reading is omnivorous and her tastes, as she begins to develop them, are highly eclectic. Many of the more modern authors are people she has actually met, in her capacity as monarch -- a few of them she has even knighted -- but she never knew what to say to them before. Her enthusiasm for opening fire stations and attending youth concerts, which she has done for half a century, begins to wane. She'd rather be reading. The Prime Minister and the various equerries who surround her worry about this tendency and try to stave off what they fear is a signal of the queen's decline, but she's been in this business far longer than any of them and manages without much difficulty to follow her own desires. And after a few years, the time comes when she realizes that to read is essentially to be a spectator -- and Her Majesty has always been a doer. And what should one \\"do\\" in regard to books? Why, become a writer, of course. The narrative flows effortlessly and the sly and dry humor will keep you smiling. Bennett is also paying the queen quite a compliment by assuming she possesses the intellect to discover (given the opportunity) that there's more to life than horses and corgis. One sincerely hopes the Sovereign acquires a copy of the book. One never knows.the queen quite a compliment by assuming she possesses the intellect to discover (given the opportunity) that there's more to life than horses and corgis.

B001ACH4DS|3.0|Very disappointed in this album.  While I enjoyed David's variety of music and delivery on AI, the tracks on this album quickly become redundant---they sound too much alike.  In addition, he often seems to be screaming the lyrics instead of singing them.  I had hoped for more.      Jack
B001EYGOEM|2.0|While I think Taylor has some good songwriting skills and is a cute girl,her voice is seriously lacking. While her voice on the CD sounds ok, I caught her live on a CMT special.  I couldn't believe it was the same person!  Her voice was off key, scratchy and sounded like she was straining on the higher notes (and again, off key!)  Like another reviewer mentioned, she needs some voice lessons. If you're a big fan, stick to the CD.  I wouldn't pay a cent to listen to her in concert!
B0000640SB|5.0|Great movie for the whole family.  If you haven't already seem this one then you might want to get it.      There is also Men in Black II that will keep the fun going.  I hear that they are in the planning to do a third movie.  I'll be there for this one too, only hope that it is as good as the first two.
B000F6YW0S|5.0|I don't think that John Williams is a Jack of all trades when it comes to classical guitar, but I do think that he is a great master of baroque music, especially music with such a cerebral component to it as Bach's.    Williams adds just the right measure of flourish and he understands the score well enough to make all its intricate layers come through. I can listen to the little fugue in the first track over and over again and it never fails to amaze me how good the separation of voices sounds.    Don't get me wrong, the pieces are melodically beautiful in themselves. The extra depth though that the composer has endowed them with and that the performer allows to develop raises them to their well deserved level of the masterpiece.    As an added bonus, the recording engineering on this release is excellent. Nothing is robbed of the wonderful sound of the guitar.    Along with Julian Bream's Granados and Albeniz CD and David Russell's Barrios collection this is one of my favorite guitar CDs. A great introduction to both classical guitar and baroque music for the uninitiated.
0670019925|3.0|the book was an easy read - with a subject matter that a lot of us can identify with: our aging bodies, retirement, aging parents, lost lust, etc.  It started out a little bit like an audiology textbook but got infinitely better as the story went on.  The English humor added to the pleasure of it.  I would recommend it for the mature audience.
B000WO251Q|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this book. It was a quick, easy read. It kind of had a boring start but definitely picked up a bit later. I loved John and Savannah as a couple but I knew once he went back to Germany, it would be a struggle for them to stay together. I will say I never truly got a grasp of the love between John and Savannah in the end. It was so wishy washy. I understand their logic but it still didn't fit right. The ending was typical but I still found it to be an average/above average book.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|PRESTO is the second record produced during Rush's pop period (1987-91) and is the most successful. Despite a couple of lulls, this is one of the strongest sets of songs that the band ever came up with. I'm not sure if they are RUSH songs, but they're good nonetheless.     The album opens with a bang. \\"Show Don't Tell\\" is probably Rush's best pure pop song. Who thought they could get funky? \\"Chain Lightning\\" is almost as good and \\"The Pass\\" is one of Rush's more inspired ballads. Finally, \\"War Paint\\" is a little silly, but who can resist the coda with the \\"boys and girls together paint the mirror black\\" bit. About as shamelessly catchy as Rush has ever gotten.    After that the record is a little more hit or miss. There is nothing that bothers me, but some of it is kind of forgettable. Still \\"Superconductor\\" is catchy and memorable, \\"Red Tide\\" is great despite its silly production, and \\"Available Light\\" is a fine track to end on. I kind of like the title track, but if you asked me to hum any of it except for the  \\"if I could wave my magic wand\\" bit I'd be stumped.    Fans of heavy progressive rock probably won't find much here to love. The crazed instrumental breaks are minimized (if not completely missing) and most of the songs clock in at under 5 minutes. If you are interested in Rush's pop period however, this would be the place to start.
B00005JPS8|5.0|We saw this in the movies and thought it was a great movie! So we decided to get the dvd. You'll like it too!
0316067601|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" is an absolutely gripping account of what \\"makes\\" the men who wear the Trident of US Navy SEALS who they are.    It is educational and compelling.

B000002GWN|2.0|I think Joni Mitchell is one of the finest musical talents of all times. That's pretty straightforward, right? Okay, so that said, this is simply an unexciting album. It's nothing much - someone claimed that each version of a song shed new light on it, but I find that the new light is either not there or it should have remained unlit. All of the songs are better in their studio incarnations, although some are different enough to be fun. I hate live concerts that are mere replicas of what you already know. Well, I never owned the vinyl that most reviewers here refer to, so perhaps I'm losing something essential, but I disagree with both those who think it would be a perfect album without the band and those who think the opposite. It's a haphazard album - some songs work, some don't, regardless of whether they're solo or with the band. Unfortunately, out of 18 selections, only a half-dozen do it for me. The mercury on my enthusiasmeter has hardly budged. According to me then, this is just a strategic mistake in an otherwise superlative career for which there aren't enough review stars to qualify it.
B000P0J09W|5.0|You have to have this in your DVD collection! Full of adventure and a great cast! Brings back so many fond memories of growing up in the 80s!
B001GQACGO|2.0|I love Beyonce. I give anything with her name on it a listen. She's a fantastic performer. However this album really disappointed me. After all these years I thought she would have grown. I'm sorry I don't see growth I see someone trying to pretend to grow. If I Were A Boy, Ego and Single Ladies are the only songs I can stomach. Halo would've been better if sang by Leona Lewis. Broken Hearted Girl, Smash Into You and Satellites just left me wishing she had left them off completely. Radio sounds like a \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" reject. Diva proves even one of the best performers in the world can't be good at everything. She should leave the rapping to Jay. To me she just doesn't go over well as a deep artist she never has been. She's not Mary J. Blige there's nothing deep about her. I don't expect there to be. When I hear Beyonce I wanna move that's what she does well: get you to the dance floor. I think splitting these albums in two was a good idea because I like Sasha Fierce. That's the part that gets on the stage and makes even Freakum Dress a hot song. I LOVE her sass. I think this constant need to release deluxe editions of albums is just a selfish attempt at more record sales especially when everyone doesn't have Beyonce money. Just put all the good songs on the first cd and stop taking advantage of your fans.
0316017922|1.0|The usual story about highly successful people focuses on intelligence and ambition.  Gladwell argues that instead we should look at things around them - family, birthplace, even birth date.<br /><br />\\"Outliers\\" opens with information about Roseto, Pa, where inhabitants had minimal heart disease.  Gladwell posits this is because of their sense of community.  A statistical perspective, however, tells us that outliers are expected and may or may not signify anything.  Credibility for Gladwell's assertion requires careful comparison of communities with and without a high sense of community, with other variables randomized.<br /><br />Gladwell then moves to Canadian hockey and observes that 40% of the best (league) players were born between Jan-March, 30% between April-June, 20% July-Sept., and 10% between Oct-Dec., a phenomena related to youth-league age cutoffs and their impact on practice.  Gladwell then slides over what he calls the absence of similar findings in the U.S. as due to not as dramatic a selection process.  Problem - American youth baseball and football have similar age cutoffs as Canadian hockey.  Thus, his thesis is contradicted.<br /><br />On to computers.  Gladwell reports on a University of Michigan freshman that became addicted to computers late in his freshman year, and concludes that his later success was due to increased amount of practice obtained programming.  But what about those who started school ahead of him?  What about new computer trainees that quickly surpass their more experienced peers?<br /><br />Gladwell sees Bill Gates' success as further proof of some sort of \\"practice makes perfect\\" explanation of his and Microsoft's success.  Reality, however, is that Gates' and Microsoft's success are much more attributable to Gates' innate business talent than skills he learned practicing programming.  Specifically, Gates' decision to BUY DOS from another firm, rename it MS-DOS, and LICENSE it to IBM - thereby becoming the industry standard and handicapping IBM's ability to compete with Microsoft.  (Microsoft is known for buggy, cumbersome programming; its \\"vaporware\\" business strategy - new product promises made without reality, have also played a bigger role in the firm's success as users would rather wait for Microsoft than take the chance of changing vendors and incurring incompatibility problems.<br /><br />Readers have no means on knowing how, or if, Gladwell cherry-picked his \\"evidence.\\"  Academic experts, using a highly structured approach, have repeatedly concluded that intellectual performance (a component of success) is 70-80% hereditary, again with random outliers.

B0018M6J90|4.0|Over the years I've seen many film reviews that will label something as \\"frothy\\" or even a \\"frothy confection.\\"  This description never really spoke to me...but the other day, I watched MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY, and nothing could describe it better than a \\"frothy confection.\\"     It's frothy because it's almost lighter than air.  A lot of energy went into whipping it into something substantial...but the slightest pressure will deflate the integrity.  It's a concoction because it is almost unrelentingly sweet and pretty much of no nutritional value.     This isn't to say it isn't fun to consume...because it certainly is.     Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) is a dowdy, straight-laced nanny who has been fired from yet another job because she actually seems to insist on disciplining the children, and perhaps isn't a very good people person.  It's the dawn of WWII in London, and there is simply no work to be found.  In fact, she's trying to dig food out of the garbage, and is reduced to eating a soup kitchen, and she has lost all of her clothes except the old, brown items she's wearing.  By \\"stealing\\" a job from her agency, she shows up at the door to a glamorous apartment, whose resident, Delycia (Amy Adams) is looking for a social secretary...a job Miss Pettigrew is not cut out for.  Or so it would seem.     Delycia, however, is in the midst of a conundrum.  She has one man upstairs in her bedroom (he's a theater producer, and Delycia wants to star in his next show...no matter the cost), but she needs to get rid of him, because the man who owns the apartment she's staying in is about to come over.  Miss Pettigrew, almost despite her distaste for the situation, manages to extract Delysia from trouble, and Delysia takes an instant liking for her new \\"friend.\\"      The movie essentially follows roughly a 24 hour period, in which we meet Delysia's several boyfriends, see the two new acquaintances head to a swanky lunch, pick out some new clothes for Miss Pettigrew, attend a fashion show, host a party and visit a nightclub.  Everywhere they go, they meet the same little circle of socialites...a bunch of backstabbers, for the most part.      The movie mostly revolves around Delysia's need to decide which man is right for her (we know almost from the beginning, so mostly we're watching to see how Delysia gets there)...and even more enjoyably, watching Miss Pettigrew emerge from her shell and take some first, delicate steps towards truly reconnecting with mankind.  The two women are just what the other needs to kick their lives forward.  Not one moment of the film is truly surprising, and while there is plenty of sniping and scheming...no one is really an irredeemable villain.      While the film is not intellectually stimulating, it has lots going for it anyway.  First of all, the costumes and sets are fabulous.  The designers must have had the best time recreating the highest possible fashion of the time.  (Pay special attention to Delysia's bedroom...it is a marvel.)  I found myself literally grinning just looking at the movie.     And the performances are delightful.  Amy Adams can't seem to fail to be charming.  In ENCHANTED, she was warm, funny and irresistible.  In MISS PETTIGREW...she's bubbly and full of life, but she's also neurotic and a bit of a floozy.  Yet by the end, she's won us over.  McDormand continues to do no wrong (in my book).  What I like about her is that she can make herself appear plain, middle-aged bordering on elderly, dowdy, severe and humorless...and then in the twinkling of an eye, she drops 10-15 years, is radiant, intelligent and full of humorous mischief.  The real fun of this film is watching her very subtle transformation.     I want to give special \\"shout outs\\" to Ciaran Hinds as the stuffy, reserved fashion designer who is intrigued by Miss Pettigrew, and to Shirley Henderson as the conniving Edythe.  Hinds is just a amazingly commanding screen presence (I'm thinking of his imperious JuliusCaesar in ROME), but here he shows his romantic side to really nice effect.  Henderson is best known as Moaning Myrtle in the HARRY POTTER films...but here she is far from playing a teenager.  Her distinctive voice serves her well in this juicy little role.     MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY is the kind of film you won't remember for long...but it was so delightful during its running time, and left me feeling good for awhile after its conclusion.  Honestly, not many movies can even live up to that modest but admirable level.
B001FSDOZO|1.0|The first two albums were great. So I went into this one expecting great things. Wow was I let down. The best part about the cd is the 2 seconds of silence in between each track. If you download this album illegally then send them a bill for the price of the CD-R. I was expecting another outstanding album from them but they didn't deliver.

044661758X|5.0|The Concrete Blonde has Connelly at the top of his game.  What's especially nice is how he has structured the story around a question of justice, which he ties into the title itself.  There are three concrete blondes in this story.  Victims become avengers and vice versa.  Connelly's hero can't remember the name of the statue of the blindfolded lady holding the sword and scales, noted twice, which is Connelly's way of giving you the homework assignment to look it up yourself.  If you do that you automatically learn more than you knew about conceptions of justice.    Very cool book, thanks Mr. Connelly.
0679746048|2.0|If this book was any longer, I would have had to put it down, I finished it in one day. It started out well, I was excited to hear what happens. Parts of it were really well written, then it just trailed off. You have no idea anything about her parents or her marriage which she summed up in a few sentences. It had a lot of potential, but it didn't really build up.     This book came across as a little too 'teen angst' to me, making it fashionable to be depressed. She sounds like she has a disorder, but thrives on it, almost like she's proud of it. Totally self indulgent. Don't waste your time.
0439023483|5.0|Hunger Games is a fast-paced novel based on a futuristic plot where 24 Tributes from 12 districts must fight against each other to the death. Their war is aired live in a reality TV manner and is required viewing for all citizens. There is never a dull moment during these games. If the tributes aren't fighting against each other then the gamemakers are spicing up the game with ricks of their own.  Suzanne Collins takes you through an entire range of emotions in this action-packed journey. You feel joy over the tributes success. You feel sadness when the tributes are wounded. You feel anger at the gamemakes for the brutal game they invented. The characters in this book are so well-developed that you can't help but to care for them. This leaves the reader feeling tormented because you know only one can survive.  This book is written in a manner that doesn't allow you to put it down. Each chapter ends with an excitement that is carried over to the beginning of the next chapter. You will finish this book wanting more. Luckily this is just the first of a series. I can't wait to see where the next book will take us.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|DH and I received this movie via Netflix and when it arrived neither of us remembered ordering it. DH assumes that perhaps it was a \\"suggestion\\" from other movies we chose. It was a really interesting film that causes one to think.<br /><br />I am a little caught, because for an idea of a story it is interesting and does keep a captive audience. The acting was fairly good although the green screen and some scenes could have been much better. Finishing the film, DH and I discussed the film and the ideas within a bit, and although they are likable, it is a little uncomfortable, because they seem to be those ideas in disguise that pull you away from the whole truth while arguing that they are harmless to what you know to be truth.<br /><br />Overall, good evening watch, but not a keeper for me. I'm not sure that I would recommend it, but be your own guide. Just remember Jesus Christ gave us truth and a handbook to explain it all.
0375826726|5.0|Another good story that leaves you hanging waiting for the next book to come out.  If you can't stand to wait for the results, wait to buy this until the last one comes out.
1595141979|5.0|Okay I just finished reading the book last night and I couldn't sleep and I couldn't stop thinking about the ending and how I can't wait to read the next book. The whole book was great we really got to see a whole new Rose and she is finally looking at the big picture when it comes to Lissa, Love, and her future. Not to give anything away but the ending is haunting me and I just can't shake it, I'm upset about it but I get it.
0743496736|5.0|I really liked this book. When I first got it, I thought there's no way I'm going to be able to stay interested in a book this long (455 pages) but i could never seem to put it down. I see what some other people say, she puts a lot of filler in her books but some stuff actually turned out to be important in the end. She really painted a picture of all of her main characters, describing their physical appearances as well as their personalities, although I was very surprised with one of the characters at the end. Overall I thought this was a great read. I'm normally very picky with the books I read and I have to say, this was one of my favorite books.
B000YAA68W|2.0|Persepolis (Vincent Peronnaud and Marjane Satrapi, 2007)<br /><br />I'm not sure why I expected the film version of Persepolis to be different than the book--which I enjoyed but wasn't nearly as impressed with as everyone else seems to have been--but I did. As it turns out, it wasn't different at all, save for making certain parts of the book stand out in even starker contrast to their surrounding scenes (such as the embarrassingly awful \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" sequence, which I can't believe anyone involved with the movie wasn't horrified enough to excise before this thing ever made it to a theater).<br /><br />I'm the first to admit that my antipathy towards both book and movie stems from my dislike of memoirs, which tend to be the work of uninteresting people who have led uninteresting lives trying to cash in on the more interesting things that happened around them. Persepolis is no different in this regard (and Satrapi has since gone on two author more books, all of which are, unsurprisingly, either memoir or biography). If you're one of the millions who currently goes gaga over memoirs, you're probably going to love this. I don't like memoirs, and had the expected reaction. Half a star dropped for that painful \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" thing. * ½
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I work for government and I have my fair share of seeing characters like Minister Hempt and Lt. Colonel Grubitz, whom appear to the world staunch beholders of believes and ideals but in reality are just power hungry and greedy.<br /><br />The one who really believes in his country's direction and who really knows how to do his job (getting confessions and snooping) right is Captain Gerd Wiesler (code name: HGW XX/7), who was classmates with Lt. Colonel Grubitz and now his subordinate.<br /><br />With an old classmate in a high place, Captain Wiesler should have no trouble moving up the career ladder into a cushy position and comfortable retirement.  A chance assignment to monitor his country's best play write and his living actress girl friend changed Captain Wiesler and those he monitored lives forever.<br /><br />Many people had summarized the plot so I won't repeat here.  I just want to say that I was shouting with joy when I saw the first of the 3 epilogues.  When Captain Wiesler was demoted by Lt. Colonel Grubitz to a basement room to steam-open letters (to check for content), Grubitz screamed at him \\"Do you know how long you'd be steaming letters?  20 YEARS!!!!\\".  People in government jobs who are out of favor, who had done something wrong, or who were not aligned with rising stars know this fate intimately.  That's why it's such a joy to see Wiesler out of steaming letters after less than 5 years at it.<br /><br />Yes, Captain Wiesler did pay for not \\"doing his job right\\", even after the fall of East Germany.  He had to make do by working as a mailman.  I can't help but to feel a rush of tears to my eyes and warmth in my heart seeing the last scene when he said to the bookstore clerk that the book \\"Sonata for a Good Man\\" he was about to pay for was \\"for him\\".  There's barely a hint of smile lurking in the corner of his mouth when the frame stopped.  That was a priceless last scene to a well-written, well-acted, and well-edited film, one of the best I've seem in the past 5 years.in the past 5 years.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Having been a fan of Kansas for over 30 years, I still enjoy every single note of their best album, LEFTOVERTURE.  When it was first released in the mid-Seventies, I was a skull full of mush at the University of Oklahoma.  I had this album on my turntable (yes, boys and girls, turntable) 24/7, whether I was cramming for a history exam or sipping brewskies in the wee hours of the morning.  And as a disc jockey at the time, you could bet the farm that the \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" 45 would be played at least once an hour during my shift.<br /><br />Good times.<br /><br />Kansas has all the components:  sensational musicianship, outstanding vocals, clean, crisp rifts.  \\"Wayward Son\\" and \\"Questions of My Childhood\\" are by far my favorite tracks, but on LEFTOVERTURE it's all good.  And timeless.  The music is just as stirring and stimulating now as it was 30 years ago; it's rock that conforms to any subsequent generation.<br /><br />Which is a good thing, as the Seventies saw a handful of bands (Kansas, Boston, Blue Oyster Cult, to name a few) successfully transition rock from classic to contemporary (or progressive rock, as many prefer to designate).  And Kansas' LEFTOVERTURE is a steady, timeless representative of the best the Seventies have to offer--then and now.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
0439023483|4.0|I have never read any books by Suzanne Collins. From the first chapter she seemlessly drew me into Katniss's world. I was transported into a future that seemed real on every level. Katniss is a female lead, believable and strong, which I enjoyed very much.<br /><br />The world in which she and the other individuals reside is full of hardships and the smallest joys. Approached from the aspect of young adults and children I wanted to know how it turned out for each of them and had to resist the urge to skip forward and satisfy my curiosity.<br /><br />This book is classified as  young adult/teen, however, as with books by other authors in this category, I would never have guessed it was not written for adults. I fully enjoyed it and the author. Before I finished Hunger Games I purchased Suzanne Collins's other novels and read them in short order. A fascinating book and a great author.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|[[ASIN:B001PPLIEG Quantum of Solace]], the long awaited sequel to [[ASIN:B000MNP2K8 Casino Royale (2-Disc Full Screen Edition)]] (2006) has finally arrived and continues immediatly from where Casino Royale ended.<br />  We join James Bond (Daniel Craig) in a fast car chase already in progress. Bullets and car metal flying everywhere. With the car battered without a drivers door, he makes it to his destination to meet M (Judi Dench). He had Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) in the trunk of the car the whole time. M (Judi Dench) instructs Bond and then they attempt to get information out of Mr. White. They come to realize that there is a new enemy organization, \\"Quantum\\", and as Mr. White tells them, \\"they are everywhere\\".<br />  Bond soon finds that out and is on another foot chase in Italy on the roof tops and in a bell tower. Along the way, he meets Camille (Olga Kurylenko) who offers him a ride.<br />  Bond goes on a trail to find this new villain. He enlists the help of Rene Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) to go with him. However, didn't we the audience, after watching Casino Royale (2006), come to realize that Mathis can't really be trusted?<br />  At the airport, Bond meets Agent Fields (Gemma Arterton) who will help him on this night in more ways than one.<br />  Our CIA agent hero, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) is already hot on the trail from his end who is already in a private plane meeting with the villain Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) with his henchman, Elvis (Anatole Taubman) and others. Felix is being asked by Greene to kill James Bond. He tells them he doesn't know him.<br />  Rene Mathis mentions they are invited to a party. It is there that Bond meets his enemy Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) and his lady friend, Camille.<br />  James Bond's CIA friend, Felix, is already there.<br />  When Greene attempts to make Camille fall in the water below Fields and Bond come to the rescue. Bond makes a getaway with Camille.<br />  But what about Agent Fields?<br />  We also discover another villain, General Medrano (Joaquin Cosio).<br />  Bond ends up killing some people along the way and after he kills an agent at a performance of \\"Tosca\\", M cannot trust him and must decommission him.  Bond continues his hunt.<br /><br />Producer Michael G. Wilson makes his cameo appearance as a man sitting in a chair in the Haitian Hotel lobby.<br /><br />  Right away you will notice this film has a different look. The traditional gun-barrel scene is gone, but turns up at the end of the film. Such a stupid move. Also gone are the traditioal phrases, \\"Bond...James Bond\\" and \\"Shaken...not stirred\\".<br />  Most of the scenes are filmed on location, but in dirty, grittier, run-down looking places. Nothing exotic here.<br />  The rumored nudity of Daniel Craig never appeared and the love scene cut very short.<br />  When Director Marc Forster really wanted this film to be cut short to 106 minutes, he meant it making it the shortest Jame Bond Movie ever.<br /><br />  I enjoyed the performaces of Joaquin Cosio who I hope to see more of in the movies. I think he could have made a memorable villain if he where in the lead.<br />  Gemma Arterton as \\"Agent Fields\\" certainly raised my eyebrow. Such an interesting character, but all too short-lived.<br />  Jeffrey Wright was given much more to do in this film as \\"Felix\\" and I hope we will see him in action again in the next James Bond films.<br /><br />  Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have mentioned that they really want to change James Bond and that with the upcoming \\"Bond 23\\", they want to make further changes.<br />  Nothing is familar in a James Bond film anymore as they take away the traditions.<br />  They are practically circumcising the James Bond character and look of the films.<br />  Well I do miss the tuxedo middle-aged James Bond with the interesting gadgets and his traditional phrases and his flirting with Miss Moneypenny and quipping at Q.<br />  With every movie the MI6 headquarters and M's office looks different.<br />  I also miss the wonderful opening sequences they use to have with a brilliant song.<br />  \\"Another Way to Die\\" sung by Jack White and Alicia Keys is the worst song I have ever heard in Bond movie history.

0312370849|3.0|The topic of this book is such an important and long-neglected part of world history that it really deserves to be treated well in a great work of fiction. I'm ashamed to say that although I knew that France had been invaded by Germany during World War II, I did not know that the occupation lasted five years. Five years during which some pretty harsh stuff happened to the Jews in France, with the French ostensibly complicit in the injustice. And there was a rich underground resistance movement in France. French nationals who resisted the Vichy government. Fascinating material for a writer willing and able to do it justice.  The historical parts of this book read like the writer wanted to detach herself from them as much as possible. They read like the author almost does not want the responsibility of telling the story of Sarah and her family as they are rounded up by the Vichy squads. And the parts of the book that are set in the present day seem frivolous and indulgent.  I still have to get through to the end of the book, so perhaps the mood will turn around. I'll revisit this review then.

B001IXSU8M|1.0|I admit, as embarrassed as I may be I got kinda sucked in by Gaga's \\"Just Dance\\".  Me coming from an electronic background was kinda looking forward to \\"The Fame\\".  I saw it for sale for only $10 so I broke one of my cardinal rules & picked it up without first giving it a proper preview.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  (And the music industry is wondering why so many people illegaly DL music; don't know, but releases like this might have something to do with it.)  The rest of the album is nothing like \\"JD\\", the music itself I guess isn't horrible, but the moment you hear \\"LG's\\" voice it completely ruins whatever said song may've had going for it.  This album has some of the most retarded lyrics I've heard in a long time.  I know pop music is generally geared towards a younger crowd, but this?  I could swear this chick is singing & trying get freaky with pre-school & kindergardners.  I really don't have anything good to say about this album at all unless you're an 11 year little boy in which case read a book little dude, just beware, this CD really REALLY SUCKS!
B0014DZ2VO|2.0|UGH!! I was SO disappointed! WHAT HAPPENED? Same writers who worked on Casino Royale (which is probably the best Bond film ever)... seemingly good director, but it just failed on so many levels. First, not Daniel Craig's fault. He's AWESOME. He makes the thing worth watching at all, but the script just wasn't great and it wasn't a great story to begin with. What's it missing? Well, the spine of a great story and good characters and scenes to ornament it. Casion Royale had it because it was based on IAN FLEMING's first and, arguably, best book (particuraly the 2nd half of the movie which follows the book and not the rather pedestrian first half which had Purvis and Wade's mediocrity-by-the-numbers-writing written all over it).    Solace is a straight revenge \\"story\\" (using word lightly here) and oddly mirrors License to Kill. That was Timothy Dalton's 2nd and final Bond movie... which, while good, didn't really have a Bond feel... civilized high living world replaced by 3rd world, south of the border, with our secret agent out to kill the bad guy on the run from his own service. License did have a completed script at least.    I think Solace starts with a great opening in Italy and ends with a good scene in Russia... both of which make you long for the film to have followed along those lines. But it doesn't. The rest of the film is just kind of boring, not suspenseful, no chemistry of character and only momentary flashes of good dialogue (thank you Paul Haggis, but not quite enough like Casino). Like everyone says (and is apparent from the moment the film begins), it's a straight steal of the Bourne movies in tone and style. That would have been okay had there been better writing.     Everything gets less and less interesting, while you're hanging on hoping it will come together... but by the time Mathis enters (returns) in you're pretty bored. Mathis' whole presence induces sleep... time that should have been spent with story and character development of those already introduced (probably one of the women and Bond's relationship with them).      Other LOWLIGHTS: Title sequence which was done by the Director's \\"own crew.\\" They say they love the 60s feel and From Russia With Love, but they made it 70s feel and no where near as good as all the recent title sequences by whoever that (talented) gentleman is. Coupled with the crappy title song (derivative, boring, pretentious... kind of like the director you say?), it serves as a warning for what the audience is about to see.    That opera-thing scene where the director went \\"artistic\\" and did inter-cutting instead of staying with Craig, substituting suspense with PRETENTIOUSNESS.     The final \\"showdown\\" with that 70s(!) style lair being blown up in pointless and again, yawn, suspense-less fashion. It's even hard to remember more about the movie...    PRODUCERS: Fire Purvis and Wade, only use Haggis for dialogue. Get new, great writers (it's a BIG WORLD... they're out there!). You say you want new and great movies... well wait to you have a GREAT STORY and SCRIPT again!!! Then get a great director (I do like some of this guy's previous films too, but he just didn't work in this area- keep with that effort though). Personal plea: BEG John Barry to do another score! LISTEN to the title song before picking it (don't just go with White and Keys because they're supposedly cool). You cannot wait 3 years either... you have to make up for this!!!!! Craig won't be young forever!! GIVE HIM ANOTHER GREAT SCRIPT! YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN CASINO ROYALE, BUT YOU HAVE TO GO WITH STORYTELLING AND SUBSTANCE, NOT JUST STYLE AND TONE!!!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Why is it that Amazon overseas buyers are kept in the dark, like Batman, about the region codes on Blu ray DVDs advertised on the various Amazon sites? It would be such a simple matter to put a region code in the list of features of these movies. It need only be something like R 1 R2 or R A etc and that would make life easier for us out of towners to recognise and buy without being a pain in the neck asking questions about compatibility. Just a thought on something that irritates me! And BTW, the latest Batman movie is 100% cinematic magic - well done.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|a relative recommended this show to me, and I'm glad she did (because since I don't subscribe to Showtime)...I wasn't aware that this series existed, until recently.  Thankfully, Netflix took care of that little problem for me.<br /><br />Dexter plays a vigilante of sorts, a hero with a very dark side...he gives justice to those that the criminal justice system can't find or put behind bars.<br /><br />Michael Hall is a great actor, balancing a killer on the one hand and a likeable, lovable professional forensics expert on the other.....as he interacts in his various relationships.<br /><br />The show has comedy, drama, tension....it had just about everything...I guess one would label this a \\"dark comedy\\" type of series.  Very dark.<br /><br />All the other characters in the show are interesting and fun to watch, and we see the dramas played out in their life through the eyes of Dex.<br /><br />This is a truly original series that hooked me quickly with its stories and interesting characters- highly recommended!
B0019GO58W|5.0|In 1985 (the year I was born people!) a certain movie was released that ultimately became a phenomenon.  It has been labeled the movie of the 80's; the poster child for teen films everywhere.  It is lauded by many and sparked a generation of look-alikes that are still being churned out even today.  That movie is `The Breakfast Club'.<br /><br />I hate that movie.<br /><br />The following year the same writer/director behind the overrated slosh known as `The Breakfast Club' wrote and directed `Ferris Bueller's Day Off', yet another film that has been labeled a film of a decade.  This time though, John Hughes hit it out of the park.  There is no `corn' factor that was so prevalent in `The Breakfast Club'.  Sure, there is dancing and obvious 80's flare, but this is a teen movie that can still hold up today alongside modern teen movies.  I don't quite understand all of the reviewers stating that it won't appeal or relate to kids today, because to me it most certainly does, and I'm a 90's child when you think about it.<br /><br />The film revolves around Ferris, a typical high school kid who just wants to have a good time.  He fakes sick so that he can stay home from school.  They he convinces his best friend Cameron (who is actually sick) to help him break his girlfriend Sloane out of school so that they can spend the day joyriding in Cameron's father's sports car.<br /><br />The film is just a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />More than mere fun though, `Ferris Bueller's Day Off' broaches some of the same object lessons promoted in `The Breakfast Club' (such as parental failings) with a little more subtlety and a lot more character.  A scene where they mimic `The Graduate' is a splendid example of them tapping into the root message of the film without overdoing it.<br /><br />The point being that this film is deep yet still manages to hold onto the fun.<br /><br />Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of Matthew Broderick.  I find him rather dull and boring.  That said, he is Oscar worthy here.  He gives what may be the definitive `teen' performance.  He grapples the humor as well as the dramatic importance of his character and he possesses a flare and natural charisma that I never knew he ever possessed.  As great as he is, Jennifer Grey is even better as his devilishly jealous sister Jeanie.  Jeffrey Jones is quite good as the principle set out on disciplining Ferris and both Alan Ruck and the beautiful Mia Sara splendidly complement Broderick's every move.<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this film, for it is a little slice of cinematic heaven.  It is funny, witty, charming and smart; all around creating a genuinely enjoyable and memorable movie experience.  Not to mention the fact that the soundtrack is beyond awesome.tive `teen' performance.

Although I pushed off reading this for a while (too many books with vampires) I thought this was up their among the best of my recent reads.  A good combination of romance and adventure that doesn't dumb things down for the young adult audience.  The combination lead to a spectacular read that was difficult to put down.  Enjoy it.

At first the changes in his voice shocked me - Tom Waites meets Leon Redbone.    But the tunes were so engaging and the band so good that the voice seemed to fit perfectly after a couple of listens. Wonderful songs from an accomplished writer.    90% of my music is classical so it's a pleasant surprise that I like this disk as much as I do. Wish all 'legends' could be this entertaining.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I saw this movie this week on DVD in two sessions on a friend's recommendation. I think it is an absolutely wonderful movie: ingenious, imaginative, always exciting, with a breathtaking performance from Natalie Portman, who takes her character through momentous emotional changes and is always riveting to watch. Hugo Weaving is magnificent as the silken-voiced V. John Hurt is marvellously menacing as the High Chancellor and I thought Stephen Fry's performance really moving and highly convincing. The plotting and dialogue are simply splendid. I also loved the early historical enactments to link the modern story with Guy Fawkes. I would have liked to have seen V's face at some point but this is only a minor quibble.     Well done, everyone who was involved with this movie!    Heartily recommended.

B00005ATZT|5.0|This is a great movie with action, drama and mystery as Richard Kimbal (Ford) escapes from legal custody and must figure out not only who has stolen his life, but why.<br /><br />The action and direction are very well done here, but the real achievement is the characterization. The people inhabiting this world feel real and identifiable. We understand the reasoning behind their actions, \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". If that were not the case (as in the sequel, \\"U.S. Marshals\\") we couldn't care what happened.<br /><br />Ford is perfect. He is appropriately intense and sympathetic.<br />Jones is excellent. Appropriately acerbic, sarcastic and caring.<br />Jones' team of marshals is perfect. The characters are distinct and fleshed out. No unnecessary redundancies in characterization.<br /><br />One satisfying twist on the \\"chase movie\\" cliche is that the antagonist, Gerard, is not actually the bad guy. He's after an escaped convict, but he's not the one who murdered Kimball's wife or framed him for the murder. More than anything, he wants justice. Even if it means he may have to change his mind about what that entails.<br /><br />Great movie. A must have for any complete library.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|this concert is truly a masterpiece to the audio to the video , it is truly an amazing piece of work,  it is right on point, if you dont have it go and get it or rent it ....
B0000696I1|3.0|This one doesn't have the same kind of charm as the first two and the fact that the Jim Henson team didn't do the animatronics on this one doesn't bode well for it. It ends up as a mostly watchable outing that suffers from a lack of real gravitas to the story. At least they've moved on from the \\"origin story\\" structure of the first two movies, allowing the Turtles to simply exist in this world. However the idea of sending them back in time to Asia doesn't serve them as well as they might have hoped.
B001CVCBLM|4.0|Mogwai continues to impress without lyrics, just very cool instrumentation. Saw them in person, and their live performance is amazing. This release is well worth getting.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|This one captures the magic of Dahl's book perfectly.  Any kid would love the imagery. The original \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" has plenty of imagination, but there are moments where it gets overly tedious. For instance, it took way too long to get into the factory itself. Then there were the unnecessary musical interludes (\\"Cheer Up Charly\\"? Puh-lease.)<br /><br />In this new iteration, however, you will notice that they get to the factory as soon as possible. There are not even any songs until they finally arrive at the door of the factory. This helps further differentiate the imaginative, fantastical air of the factory from the monotonous drudgery of the \\"real world\\". When we first watched it in the theater (I went with my brother, his wife and their [then] two daughters) my brother admitted that he was so surprised that they didn't have a long unnecessary song in the scene where Grandpa Joe gets out of bed for the first time in years. The scene played out better for that simple omission.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy the Gene Wilder version, but this one has a charm and energy that is simply frenetic, while the other one got a bit too caught up in justifying certain aspects of the story-telling.<br /><br />Wonderful movie. Imaginative and colorful. Even the elements that were added to the story (i.e. Willy Wonka's relationship with his father) have a very Roald Dahl feel to them.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This should be required viewing for each and every \\"next\\" generation. You come away with a very good idea about the human cost of war, the folly of war, the stupidity of war and the horror of war. Very complete in its coverage, not just the holocaust. The actual film footage from the era is absolutely fascinating (alot of it in color). Just a great documentary. Lots of extras over and above the original episodes. And the price is right.
B00004YA66|5.0|[Slight Spoiler Alert]<br /><br />This is a great movie.  The sci-fi aspect of it is very minimal and only serves to underscore the message of the rest of the story.  Just how far would you go to save someone you loved?<br /><br />When I saw it in theaters, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has good action. It's a great thought exercise. I just loved Quaid (as always). It just had the perfect combination of elements. When I got it for my brother for Christmas however I was surprised by the reaction my mother had after we watched it with the whole family. She was just sobbing at the end. I figured she would enjoy it, but I did not expect that kind of reaction.<br /><br />In hindsight, though, it is completely understandable. The scene at the end where Quaid shows up to save his son is actually very affecting. The constant rift of time between a young man an his father creates a very unusual but effective separation. They can talk to each other, but that's it. At the end, however, the breaking of that barrier just at the time of greatest need for one of them creates a very emotional scene.<br /><br />Watch it. Love it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is one of my favorite Walt Disney movies so I purchased it to share with my granddaughter.  She of course loves it too.  We watch it almost everytime she visits.
B001F7MSFW|4.0|If you liked the first one, this is right up your alley.<br /><br />I say that mainly because the tone (darker than many mainstream movies), the occult nature and the unusual imagery do have a tendency to put some movie-goers off. But if you simply want to see a movie about a demon who was raised by humans to fight evil, this is a great movie for you.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro's direction style is very kinetic and flowing. This helps keep the pace of the movie going, keeping it from feeling like it is dragging. The scenes flow very nicely from one to the next (which is also done very nicely with some creative wipes and overlaps).<br /><br />The real draw for this film, however, is Hellboy and the team that has been provided for him. Ron Perlman is the absolutely perfect Hellboy. His delivery of the lines is nothing short of perfect in creating an acerbic, yet ultimately lovable (as well as loving) character. He has a wry humor about him that makes the Hellboy character something that we can all relate to. We've all had times when we feel under appreciated. We've all felt like the unwelcome outsider. Yet despite all of the inducements that he has to give up defending these humans, he continues to do it because that is what his \\"father\\" taught him to do.<br /><br />Of course Abe and Liz are here as well, and Doug Jones and Selma Blair each do a wonderful job of portraying their respective characters. But this is not their movie. It is interesting, however, to see one of the story elements of the first movie get turned around to portray the other side of it in this one when the team encounters the angel of death.<br /><br />In short, as I said above, if you liked the first one, this is just your kind of movie. I look forward to seeing what del Toro has in mind for the third movie. (Of course, we'll have to wait for him to finish \\"The Hobbit\\" first.)
B001ED7C58|5.0|Wonderful! Favorites Paramore, Muse and of course listening to Robert Pattinson's voice is out of this world.
B0000696I0|4.0|As a sophomore outing for this franchise, this is a competent followup to the original that delves a bit more into the actual origins of the Turtles and their mentor. It is very much an enjoyable film for those who liked the first outing. However it is also quite similar in many ways. There are new action scenes and new jokes that play out well enough. But they are still lingering on the Turtles and their origins. After the first movie, it would have been nice to see them move on to simply accepting their place as a recognized force in the universe and moving on to a story bigger than themselves. (It is also a little distracting that Donatello's voice changed due to Corey Feldman's time in rehab.)<br /><br />It would also have been nice to see them introduce more of the recognized characters from the Turtles' mythology, such as Baxter or Beebop and Rocksteady.<br /><br />Still, it is competently done and enjoyable to watch.
630542845X|4.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!    Sean Patrick Flanery is almost unrecognizable in this movie about an Albino boy with extrodinary powers.  While still in the womb, Powder's mother is struck by lightning while standing in a puddle.  She is lost but her son survives.  Gifted with incredible intellect, telepathy, and paranormal powers over electricity, Powder is pulled from his sheltered life after both grandparents have died and is tossed into the care of the state.    Children can be so cruel but never underestimate the power of the human spirit.  This movie will make you feel warm and fuzzy all over.
B000002H97|3.0|It's almost twenty years after the black album came out. I was a rabid Metallica fan when this album first dropped (I was 14). At the time, I was extremely heartbroken. This was not the band that pressed the previous four albums (five counting \\"Garage Days\\"), all of which are still in my personal top ten of great heavy metal records.   I have bought those four albums several times, on LP, cassette, and CD.  I bought this album once, on cassette, almost two full decades ago.  This isn't one that needs replacing.    Not that it's a bad album. It's just a bad Metallica album. You went in expecting Kill Em All, Lightning, Puppets, and Justice, and instead you got \\"New Jersey\\" from Bon Jovi. Bob Rock has his cheesy fingers all over this album.    The Black Album is a snapshot of one of the biggest \\"departures\\" in recording history.  Metallica were the kings of metal music, bar none, when this record dropped.  No one disputed that fact (even most Slayer fans, which says a lot).  No one wrote songs like Metallica did up until 1991.  Then Metallica started writing songs like everybody else wrote them: Short, sweet, and saccharine. Not the real thing.   In retrospect, this album is Metallica's pivotal moment.  All the albums before it are far superior. All the albums after it are inferior.  The black album itself is just \\"okay.\\" No masterpieces, no loathsome depths, just a lot of shallow water.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|There was never a more impressionable movie.  It's a wonderful, telling tale everyone in the family can adore from beginning to end!  The creators should be honored to have concocted such a treasurable jewel for the ages!  In a word, it's truly a masterpiece!  I can't speak highly enough about this movie!  :)
B0013FSL3E|2.0|For those of us parents who were expecting a movie as thoroughly enjoyable as Toy Story or Monsters Inc., which was highly entertaining for both the parents AND their preschool-aged children, this was a HUGE disappointment. None of us--my husband, I, and our children--enjoyed the movie. Having 3 little boys, I was excited by the prospect of a movie about robots made by Pixar. What better combination, I thought. Unfortunately, the movie is not about Wall-E or his story. It's about staring at the earth filled with mountains of garbage and watching a nearly personality-less robot make these mountains of garbage for extremely long periods of time. Since when have I ever sat in a movie theater and thought...\\"Okay, surely the story is going to start any moment\\" only to find out it never does? This is a first! Pixar failed miserably in utilizing a potentially great character to weave a cautionary tale--they wasted Wall-E! Instead of inspiring the spirit to take care of the earth, Pixar has nearly satirized the environmentalist message through the painfully long landscape scenes and lack of plot. The movie belabors the obvious. The robots are uninteresting and barely qualify as characters. Wall-E lacks the humor, excitement, and classic story-telling techniques I have come to expect from Pixar. This movie is certainly outside Pixar's box, and for that reason we were terribly disappointed.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I thought the soundtrack was good but I was surprised that there wasn't any Lynkin Park which I would have pictured for Bella.  I also thought that some Evanescence would have been a nice touch especially their song \\"Lithium\\".  So all and all I like it.
0061537934|5.0|I loved this book!!! A unique perspective on life from a canine point of view, which I found myself ageeing with more often than not. On my list of all time favorites and highly recommended to dog lovers everywhere.
0756404746|5.0|Without exaggeration or hyperbole, I can say that this is one of the finest books I have ever read.  For masterfully crafted prose I would pit Rothfuss against any writer of contemporary literature, but this novel is distinctly fantasy.      I have been a reader of fantasy for about 20 years including the writing of GRRM, Lynch, Erikson, Keyes, Hobb, Bujold, Jordan, Feist, Wolfe, Eddings, Wurtz... I could go on.  My point is that none of them surpassed the debut novel of Patrick Rothfuss.  Buy this book!
B001GQACGO|4.0|Unfortunately, the deluxe edition is only going to hurt Beyonce. The standard version of I AM...Sasha Fierce is, like Bday, too short and convoluted. It seems a bit incomplete. The deluxe version is much better with the addition of several songs that are by far superior than most of the songs that are from the standard album. For instance, Smash Into You, Ego, Hello and Scared of Lonely are infectious and melody laden unlike Diva and Video Phone which sound almost identical to Awwww Sh****t from Kelis' \\"Kelis Was Here.\\" And none of the Sasha songs come remotely close to matching the greatness of Crazy in Love, Baby Boy, Naughty Girl, Deja Vu, Upgrade U, and Ring the Alarm. This paradox happened with Bday too which is a great album but it was too short and omitted amazing b-sides such as Lost Yo Mind, Back Up, Flaws and All, and World Wide Woman.    It's the 1st disc where Beyonce and her songwriters are at their best with gorgeous melodies and personal lyrics. The success of Irreplaceable was the best thing to happen to Beyonce as it showcased her vulnerability and mass appeal as an artist. It's unfortunate that most fans will not dish out the extra cash (as the record company is hoping they will) to buy the deluxe version as they will be missing out on some of Beyonce's most amazing songs to date.     Throwing away the idea of a 2 disc concept album, the songs compiled here would make without a doubt her best album thus far. Consider this track list:    1. If I Were A Boy  2. Single Ladies  3. Disappear  4. Radio  5. Satellites  6. Smash Into You    7. Halo  8. Ego  9. Sweet Dreams  10. Broken Hearted Girl  11. Hello  12. Scared of Lonely  13. Ave Maria    Omissions:  That's Why You're Beautiful, Diva, Video Phone
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My family and I absolutely loved this movie.  So much so that we went out and bought it on the day it came out (which never happens).  It's lack of dialog in the beginning and simple message throughout coupled with the subtle humor that only adults would recognize make it a hit for everyone.  Disney/Pixar did it again!
B001GQACGE|1.0|Check out Solange's cd. Her sound is retro yet more original sounding. Beyonce's overrated. Yes, Solange does have talent! Beyonce needs some real writers to assist her in putting together a cd. \\"Put a Ring On It\\" sounds like  2 songs she had on B-day. Although I like \\"If I Were a Boy,\\" It is a rip off of Ciara's song \\"Like a Boy.\\" Please get some new & original material!! In my opinion, talent outdoes looks all the time. Beyonce you are still beautiful, but your music.....SUCKS!
0679735259|5.0|This is an almost stream of consciousness series of snapshot impressions of what his time in Vietnam meant to him. I feel that Mr Herr wrote the book for himself as much as anyone else, and for that reason alone, he should be indulged because his impressions are his alone and to get the true value of this book, you have to make the journey with him.     I have some small experience of conflict (Bosnia and Northern Ireland) and have to say that I do not feel as \\"sexy\\" about it as Mr Herr makes Vietnam look, but then again it was the 60s and Vietnam was the first \\"rock and roll\\" war, but in some ways, the bond of the fighting man and the accoutrements of war, the guns, the planes, the helicopters, and the momentary lack of accountability that can allow the combat soldier to revert to a more primal state, can at the instant, be a real turn on. The ground rush, the noise, the wind and the sheer head-wreck of a low level heli-bourne insertion, particularly in potentially hostile situations, is hard to describe. No soldier seriously in these times truly thinks about what it would mean to be maimed, or what would happen if the helicopter snagged a wire or succumbed to ground fire and hit the ground in a heartbeat, you just don't.    It's why generations of young men (and latterly women) join the armed services, or volunteer, deep within us is primal desire to experience combat, to kill or be killed. Its not something that many rational or sane people would admit to, but Michael Herr tries to take us beyond that world of the rational and the sane to a level where the normal rules don't apply. It's a bit of a heresy to admit that war is fun, but he sometimes does so.     I cant compare my experiences to his, because mine are different, and this book makes a very interesting counterpoint to a book like \\"Jarhead\\", but the only criticism of this book that would warrant serious merit would be from someone who was a combat soldier in Vietnam. Let him tell me why he didn't like this book and I will listen.
0525478183|5.0|\\"Paper Towns\\" was written by a smart, smart man.  I've heard about John Green before, but this is the first time I've read one of his novels, and I can hardly articulate how impressed I am.  He writes flawed, nuanced characters that spout off highly quotable dialogue.  In short, this is a book you quite simply need to buy.  To elaborate a bit...    The book is divided into three sections.  In the first, Margo Roth Spiegelman takes Quentin, our protagonist (who, sidebar, is in love with her) on a crazy, 'spontaneous' journey that changes his life forever.  In the second part, Quentin tries to make sense of the events that follow that glorious night.  In the third and final part, he goes on a road trip with his friends in order to meet up with Margo.  All of this seems rather simple, but it's packed so tight with bittersweet poignancy, insight, and intelligence that you can hardly believe the book is only three-hundred pages long.  And really, when a book can incorporate Walt Whitman's \\"Song of Myself\\" as well as this one did, and offer more insight into Whitman's words than any literary criticism possibly could... what more could you ask for?    The book is just overflowing with ideas, literary references, deep understanding of the way senior year in high school feels, and--most importantly--insight into the way people perceive things.  What I love most about Green's writing is that he never has the characters settle on these big, life-changing revelations.  When Quentin discovers something vital about understanding life, his finds are often refuted by a new realization, that is later refuted itself.  It's a very \\"in the moment\\" novel, written about a boy in love with a very \\"in the moment\\" girl.  I love how there are so many ideas at work here that you never feel talked down to, because Green isn't really giving his readers a message.  He's just encouraging them to ponder things in order to, hopefully, connect with one of these ideas.  Because, in the end, this intricate and insanely well-written book is just about someone connecting with something else.    9/10
B001HDYK6Y|2.0|Thank you Amazon, for offering this album at a special price the day it was released.  I had planned on going to my local store to pick up the cd, but decided to save a few bucks instead.  Glad I did.  There are some good songs here, but they are obscured by an overwrought production right out of 1986.  I know there's an 80's retro sound out there, but this is like \\"Starship\\" 80's, not Talking Heads.  It's one of those albums you won't listen to again after the first time.  This is sour bubblegum.
B000NA28I4|4.0|Although \\"Eragon\\" is palpably derivative of a number of fantasy franchises (\\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Lord Of The Rings,\\" \\"Wizard Of Earthsea,\\" et. al.) it is still quite enjoyable, if a bit on the lightweight side.  I have not read the original book, but coming into this blind, the film was about what I'd expected. Obviously it's been streamlined and no doubt dumbed-down a bit, but the special effects are good (the dragon, mostly, looks cool) and the story clops along at a decent pace.  Nothing here will surprise you, but it's hardly the dismal filmic disaster other reviews have implied... It's just a goofy, no-brainer Hollywood action film, good if you want something light.<br /><br />And the dragon looks cool.<br /><br />(Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B001EN71DG|2.0|If you buy this DVD set you will get both the original Star Wars movies and their re-mastered versions. Unfortunately, you will not get the special edition versions (that version has probably been incinerated) that were Lucas' first attempt at editing his magnum opus. Also, the original versions of the film have not been cleared up in any way. I don't mind that so much because I actually like watching a movie that has a movie feel to it (audiences today have been ruined by expecting perfection and have absolutely no taste for atmosphere). The real problem with this set is that there is no new material here. It was all released just two years ago. This DVD set is just another attempt by Lucasfilm to cash in. They are one company that is excellent at getting people to buy the exact same thing of something they already have.<br /><br />The only reason to buy this DVD set is if you don't own the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD. Otherwise, keep your cash and stop giving it to George until he offers something worthwhile.
0312370849|5.0|Tatiana de Rosnay has created a powerful addition to holocaust literature in this moving story of a child and a woman, half a century apart, linked by wrenching events in France during World War II. Many readers may have been unaware of the extent of collaboration between France's Vichy government and the German Nazi occupiers, and few are likely to have read of the round-up of Jews in Paris which comprises the core event in this book.<br /><br />This is first rate fiction and de Rosnay artfully keeps mystery and surprise alive in each chapter, sliding back and forth from the 1940s to 2004, even to the final page. She paints a wrenching portrait of the inhumanity of the death camps, the incomprehension of those sent to their deaths and the willing participation of average people in the brutality. This novel does more to bring home the horror of that era than any account in my fairly wide reading experience, principally through the device of reporting via a child's-eye view of the terror.
B001E75QH0|2.0|INDIANA JONES-THE COMPLETE ADVENTURE COLLECTION is a four DVD set collection of the four Indiana Jones films. For those who don't know, the four Indiana Jones movies are:<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (that's the original title; I resist Lucas revisionism as much as possible)<br />INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM<br />INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE<br />INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL<br /><br />The first three films were released in the spring of 2008 as special edition discs. The only thing new here is the inclusion of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. Other than that movie and the extras that are included with it, there is nothing else new here.<br /><br />Therefore, if you already have purchased the first three movies, just buy a copy of INDIANA JONES AND THE CRYSTAL SKULL (it has the same extras that are included on this disc) and save yourself thirty or forty dollars. If you don't own those movies, I'd still advise you buy them separately. Prices have dropped since the special edition DVDs were released in the spring and you can buy all four of the individual movies for a total of about $5-$10 less for what it costs for this boxed set.

BLESSED BE!!!
B001EN71DQ|2.0|There's really not much to say about this DVD box set. It includes the three movies that make up the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy: THE PHANTOM MENACE, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and THE REVENGE OF THE SITH. There are some extras on these discs, but don't be fooled by the way they are worded: everything on here has been released before. There is nothing new on the discs (unless there's some Easter egg I haven't found, yet). This is once again an example of George Lucas milking the cash cow for all it's worth. However, I think even die hard Star Wars fans have begun to see that George is really the President of the Trade Federation and have stopped buying re-treads like this.<br /><br />The only reason to buy this DVD box set is if you haven't already purchased thee movies before. Even if you haven't you might be able to buy all three separately and still get them for a total of about $5 less than this set.

B0017I1FP8|5.0|This music is suited perfectly to the tone of the movie, and I came out of the movie thinking that the score was almost another character of the film. Visual sets and actor's performances are easy to appreciate, but without an effective score, many movies would fall flat.    What I didn't expect was how much I enjoyed each repeated listening. I enjoy good movie soundtracks, and my recent favorites include the entire \\"Complete Recordings\\" collection from the Lord of the Rings movies by Howard Shore ([[ASIN:B000BNI90O The Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring (The Complete Recordings)]] remains my favorite of the three). Now that I've had time to listen to this title a few times, and also those other titles, I find myself enjoying this one more and more each time.    Make no mistake, this score is as dark as the movie. You're not going to get anything light and airy here, but if you've seen the movie, you know what to expect.    My wish is that they would release this soundtrack as an alternate audio track on the DVD and Blu-ray release, as I believe that it would provide an even deeper appreciation of what Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard have accomplished here. I would easily pay the purchase price of this soundtrack again to be able to experience that!    If you enjoyed the movie, and you like music, I think you will enjoy this!
B001DCQIAU|5.0|This 38-CD box gathers at super-budget price a raft of recordings that are otherwise full or mi price in the DG catalog. There are only a few sweeteners, such as a Schuman Fourth from 1987 with the Vienna Phil.  The Beethoven cycle is from 1977, the second done for DG. The Brahms is the 1977-78 cycle, also his second. Good as this bargain is, the eight symphonic cycles that are included will also be released as separate sets in due course (they are already out in the UK but at twice the price per disc).<br /><br />Veteran collectors will be disappointed to know that none of these recordings have been remastered, only repackaged.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|I was enchanted with \\"Wall-E\\" from the beginning.  I kind of have a thing for cute little robots, and this little bucket o' rust is as cute as they come.  Which I suppose suggests this is a little kid movie, but instead I found a riveting piece of art of the same quality as last year's fabulous \\"Ratatouille\\".<br /><br />The animation is stellar, and I could not help but like the infusions of live-action.  Where else does one find outer space done with such vividity, and such playful cartooniness put on its characters?  It's fantastic.<br /><br />However, what really gets me about this movie is the heart.  Its leading couple may be pieces of metal, but their story is a romance for the ages, one that does not worry about details but only pure and simple love.<br /><br />Some may consider the environmentalism bit a little heavy-handed; I happen to believe that depends on how one feels about environmetalism; I didn't mind it.  More than blatant environmentalism, I feel this is a story of hope.<br /><br />\\"Wall-E\\" is a fantastic piece of art that packs a childlike sense of innocence.  I hope this will become a classic. It deserves it.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Once again Pixar proves to be a giant among it's peers! 'Wall E' is nothing short of amazing and steps outside it's \\"kiddies movie\\" boundaries with this smart and endearing Sci-Fi love story! While the film is short on dialogue, it does not suffer from having nothing to say! It's amazing(there goes that word again!)how much is said without the use of \\"words\\" in this beautiful and poignant film.<br /><br />Not since R2 D2 stole the show in 'A New Hope' has a little robot had so much character and charm. Wall E says little, but his feelings are so well conveyed you won't miss one heartbeat! Besides having many great and lovable characters, the animation is truly breathtaking. The story may be a little too deep a satire for small children to truly understand, but they will fall in love with the characters anyway.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made bar none! It's a monumental achievement on every level and Pixar should be very proud of their new baby!......It's just fantastic! I can't wait to watch it again and I will this weekend. The 3 disc set is wonderful with so many great treasures to uncover and a beautiful DVD transfer to boot. Wall E is nothing short of spectacular and it should be up for Academy Awards across the board!<br /><br />****ONE SIDE NOTE**** My copy had problems playing for the first half hour or so, I'm waiting for a replacement to see if it's an isolated case or the entire batch of DVD's is bad, I will add the information once I know more, it would be tragic if this fantastic movie's release is defective by design!<br /><br />****DVD UPDATE**** I bought a single disc edition and it played perfectly, I am going to buy another 3 disc edition to see if I it's defective. I will add when I know more.<br /><br />****NEWEST DVD UPDATE**** I received my replacement for the 3 disc and it is defective as well! I guess I'm going to keep the single disc. Too bad. The 3 disc has some great material on it.<br /><br />The defective disc does play perfectly in some of my DVD players while not so well in my home theater Denon 3910 machine!? I have had this problem with only a hand full of discs,<br /><br />1)Casino 10th anniversary<br />2)Hammer box set(Evil Of Frankenstein)<br />3)Rodan(new 2 disc edition released with War Of The Gargantuas which plays perfectly?)<br />4)Wall E (3 disc version not sure if the 1 disc version has the same problem?)<br /><br />I hope Disney is going to correct this problem and offer replacements.rs while not so well in my home theater Denon 3910 machine!?

B0001N9ZKW|5.0|but there's really no other word for this album.  Fascinating lyrics, lovely melodies, a thoroughly pleasing mix of the wry, the melancholic, the absurd, the surreal, and the celebratory.  Linda's singing is wonderfully controlled and understated, but Richard's is even better.  He may lack her pipes but his delivery was never better.     Most amazing of all, though, is Richard's impeccable guitar work.  It is delightful throughout, but especially on the first two cuts.  The extended fade out of \\"When I get to the border\\", where he trades licks with the concertina, would be enough all by itself to establish him as one of the great originals of the instrument.  But that's just a set-up for what he does at the beginning of 'Calvary Cross,'-- a chilling display of fret-prowess. Even after all these years, it still sends spiders crawling up my spine.
0439023483|4.0|Well, all in all I really liked this book.  It's a very familiar theme, post-apocalyptic, future world with some really old school notions about entertainment.  So it takes place in the future and much like logans run or the running man, there are these events that rather brutal, to the point it's kind of uncomfortable to imagine. (The only rule of the game is you can't eat the other contestants ;-( )<br /><br />Many such themed books involve people watching this brutality as spectators, like the Romans did with the gladiators.  To be a little more timely, it's done as more of a reality show but the same principle holds. The heroine's little sister is chosen to participate and she nobly takes her place.  That's how she gets involved in the whole thing.  That's about the point the book stopped being really cool and just got cool. There's this love triangle thing that happens (I don't want to spoil it for anyone) that really made me feel like I was in a high school girl novel and not a brutal sci-fi novel.<br /><br />The book is cool and I don't want to imply that I didn't like it. Like I said, it's very interesting, she does a great job creating a really creepy atmosphere that is very dark and miserable and some of the details are just plain awesome.  I didn't like the love affair angle b/c just like Jar Jar Binks in star wars, it felt like it didn't naturally fit there and instead was shoved into fit.<br /><br />All in all though, if you like sci-fi, like The Running Man, Logan's run etc, you'll like this.
B001GQACGO|5.0|Beyonce Knowles, on this Cd delivers and creates an exceptional CD.  I Am...Sasha Fierce is a wonderful CD to listen to and purchase.  With time comes change, and throughout Beyonces career, we continue to grow, as she gains and loses things that she loves to sing about.  This album took risks that her fans may not be use to, but appreciating good quality music and change is good and healthy, and we all could use a dose of this medicine...My personal fav...Diva-Hello-Ave Maria-Satellites, hell the whole album.....Good Job To Beyonce Knowles and her inspirations for this album.....AD-TX

B001FSDOZO|4.0|I didn't know Mutt produced this new NB effort and when I listened to This Afternoon, I got the Mutt influence immediately and notice how it had the Pour Some Sugar format in the structure of this song.  If you don't believe me listen to the two songs side by side and you'll see the same bridge to chorus format Mutt used with Def Leppard.  This is not to say this is bad but it is there.  I predict this CD will be the biggest selling CD for NB.  There's to many good songs on it.  I listened to the CD and found seven songs that could/should be on radio; who knows how many more after a few more listens.  This is a must buy for NB fans and fans of good guitar music with Mutt Lang heavy drums.  This will be the album of the year and cranked next summer at outdoor parties.
1558908846|5.0|A lot of action, good movie to be a old school...Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante could pass for brother they matched them up good...Rob Schneider is so hilarious..
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Getting \\"Mutt\\" Lange nowadays to produce one of your albums is sheer impossibility. Just ask Def Leppard who have been after the man for years and come up with squat. After all the man has made his billions and is now kind of semi retired and living in seclusion going through a divorce with Shania Twain. His credits are endless....The Boomtown Rats, AC/DC, Def Leppard, Foreignor, Bryan Adams and has Produced such classic albums such as HIGHWAY TO HELL, BACK IN BLACK, PYROMANIA, & HYSTERIA. All of these albums have made these bands superstars in their own right and propelled them to sell over 20 million in record sales on each album. Can \\" Mutt\\" do the same for Nickleback? who knows? He must see something in them to produce them. Ive listened to this album 4 times already and its grown on me each time. I can hear the \\"Mutt \\" influence and his songwriting touches in some of the songs also. Im just glad this album didnt take 5 years to make. Which Mutt is notorious for. The Big hit \\" Gotta Be Somebody \\" is obviously made for radio play. It has hit written all over it. Im not going to say it breaks new ground . In fact it has an 80's type back beat with an up to date crisp todays style. Its a good song. Its a good Nickleback song, something new for them. I can see this song putting Nickle back on the map where even non rockers know who they are.         \\"Shakin Hands \\" Rocks ! Its a great rock song and it says to young fans....We havent abandoned you,even though were moving forward. I love the song . One of the best Ive heard all year.           \\" Never Gonna Be Alone\\" is a sweet ballad. Maybe directed towards airplay also. Maybe thats what Nickleback is aiming for .After what the last album did with \\" Photograph\\".   Last but not least my all time favorite on this album.....I LOVE THIS SONG....\\" THIS AFTERNOON\\" what a great song! Its funny ,you can sing along to it, its got a great memorable chorus. Its just a great song. Its just about having fun with your friends andforgetting about life for awhile.      All in all Id give this album 4 stars out of 5 . Go do yourself a favor and buy it. You wont be sorry. Who knows you may just be holding onto a classic. Mutt'll never steer you wrong.
B001GQACGO|3.0|Although I am a HUGE fan and own all of DC's CD's and Bey's CD's....this CD is just not enough.  I think there are only a coupole of hits on the CD and they are both getting air play right now.  I will continue to be a fan and probably go back to see her in concert again...but I am just not feeling this.  I will play it some more and hope it grow on me.

B00180R06I|5.0|Released at the same time as Dracula and Frankenstein,Carl Theodor Dreyer's dreamlike film,\\"Vampyr\\" is one of the few times in cinema a director has succeded in capturing a nightmare on the screen.    The film loosely follows Sheridan Le Fanu's \\"Carmilla\\",Vampyr follows the story of a wanderer who finds himself in a village surrounded by superstition and the supernatural.    The mood Dreyer creates is one of intense dread and terror,creating a dream like feel to the film utilizing elements such as cloth draped over the lens to create a shadowy haze effect upon the viewer.  Vampyr is a collection of some of the most outstanding and scary supernatural images ever put on film.    For years the film was thought lost,and the Criterion edition is the best that has ever been available.  The subtitles are pefected and the sound and quality are better than ever.  Criterion has also released this DVD in a beautiuful case complete with Fanu's original story and the screenplay of the film.  Commentary and a documentary on Dreyer are also included.    This is a must not just for the serious Horror buff,but any student of cinematic art.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I bought this for my partner, and she plays it ALOT!  It's not my cup of tea but to her it is great.  So, I guess if you like his style of music,you will enjoy it.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Well, I think that says it all, right? He has a great voice he uses to perfection in this CD. It has great melodies and excellent lyrics. I voted my fingers off for David during AI, because he was so different, talented and a gifted virtuoso performer. If you want a great listen, buy this CD.     The only negative I have of this CD is the picture of David on the cover, it's awful. I think it's an unfortunate choice.
B001GQACGO|4.0|FIRST OF ALL, LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT I LOVE BEYONCE AS AN ARTIST. SHE IS VERY TALENTED. I AM A BIG FAN!<br />THE FIRST DISC.<br />I LOVED EVERY SONG ON THE DISC ONE ESPECIALLY,IF I WERE A BOY, IS A VULNERABLE SONG, JUST HER VOICE AND A GUITAR.<br /><br />DISC TWO<br />THE CD STARTS OFF WITH SINGLE LADIES,PUT A RING ON IT. I HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT I DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT IT HAS GROWN ON ME. IT IS UP TEMPO.<br />NOW, TRACKS 2-5 I DON'T LIKE AT ALL. AS I SAID BEFORE THIS IS NOT THE BEYONCE WE ARE USED TO.<br /><br />BUT TRACKS 6 HELLO, AND TRACK 8 SCARED OF LONELY ... ARE ALSO NOT WHAT I'M USED TO WITH BEYONCE,BUT SURPRISINGLY I WAS REALLY LIKING IT.SCARED OF LONELY IS A REALLY NICE TRACK.<br /><br />SO, OVERALL OUT OF THE 16 SONGS ON BOTH CD'S I REALLY WILL LISTEN TO 10 OF THEM.<br /><br />EITHER YOU WILL LOVE THE CHANGE OR HATE IT.<br /><br />I JUST AM HAPPY TO SEE BEYONCE DOING HER THING REGARDLESS OF THE HATERATION. DO YOUR THANG B.<br />YOU MADE THIS FAN CHANGE HER VIEW  OF WHAT I THOUGHT IS A TYPICAL BEYONCE STYLE.
B001EO2UKO|4.0|Dido is one of those artists who is instantly recognizable just by listening to her cool, controlled and soft voice.  Even when singing about tragic situations, the most emotion she allows to enter her voice is a wistfullness.  For Dido, everything is steady as she goes.  Even in the most painful moments, which this CD encapsulates.    Like many fans, this album has been a long time coming, filled with much anticipation.  But I knew the moment I heard the tragic news of her father's passing that it would be awhile for the CD to percolate.  And it's true, her father's passing has cast a pall over the songs here.  It's a very somber album, moreso than her previous two.  But it's also a terrific melding--finally--of her voice and the instrumentation.      I've always felt that, in the previous two albums which I love by the way, the music was there to support her voice.  If you were to strip her voice, you wouldn't have much.  Enter Jon Brion, a producer/writer who's worked with a variety of female artists through the years.  He brings to the table some nice melodies that are distinctly his.  It helps add to these songs in ways I never expected, whether it's the fun beat in \\"Us 2 Little Gods\\" or the sudden swelling of strings in some other songs.      The lyrics here are the best she's written.  By far the most heartbreaking song is \\"The Day Before The Day,\\" a song that seems to directly tackle her father's death.  She sings, \\"I didnt get to say goodbye the day before the day / was trying to get to work on time, thats why I turned away / and missed the most important thing you've ever tried to say / I've lived my life without regret until today.\\"  It's moments like these that showcase a mature and powerful voice and its this dichotomy between the painful lyrics and her usually controlled voice.  During this song, however, wistful sounds and even despair come into play.      Safe Trip Home is a terrific album, even though the last half turns very sad and slow.  And Dido's voice is still the pure and beautiful instrument it has always been.  One thing I'd like to see, though, for once is to see that constant voice break and see Dido really let out some emotions.  But that's not really her.  And that, I think, is ironically why I love listening to her.
0743298039|5.0|Diane Setterfield's novel is based on the story Vida Winter, a well-renowned author in England. Her dark and tormented past led her to finally divulge her story to Margaret Lea, a quiet, passionate librarian. Even though both women seem to be complete opposites, the readers discover that they both suffer from separation from family and the death of a twin which gives them more in common than they expected.    The Thirteenth Tale is a story about a dysfunctional family, where the birth of a girl named Isabelle led to incestuous feelings from a brother, and the birth of two twin girls; Adeline and Emmeline. However, the readers find out that there are more secrets in the house than just the strange twins. There is a presence of a ghost that drives away the mistress, Hester, and the strange transformation of the radical Adeline into a smart, sensible mistress of the mansion. During Winter's recollection, the readers discover her true identity and the mystery of the twin is resolved.    As for Margaret, she has her own set of troubles to deal with. Her mother's coldness towards her existence and her father's indifference was something she had to endure all her life. The readers discover a hidden passion within Margaret, despite her bland introduction, and as the story progresses, she begins to take charge of her situation and actively solves the mystery behind Winter's life. During her work, she encounters a man named Aurelius, who is connected to the family and towards the end of the novel, they both find a family in each other.    The book was an enjoyable read, and even though the content matter seemed too dramatic at first, Setterfield's use of subtlety left the readers wondering in the end. A plot based on an average family is marvelously unraveled as secrets begin to pour out and I believe the readers will find something to relate to in this book, especially those who are twins or are close to their siblings.
1552091090|5.0|I don't usually write book reviews, but this book has a special place in my heart and I wanted to share my love for it. Let me also preface by saying that my husband HATES this book. It is very sentimental and sappy. You have to be able to appreciate allegory, to suspend disbelief.     Obviously it is creepy if a mom actually drives across town and climbs into her grown son's window so she can rock him to sleep... but reading this book with such an unimaginitive outlook misses the essence. And I think that many readers underestimate their preschooler's ability to \\"get it\\". In fact, given the fantastical quality of a little old lady rocking a grown man, I think preschoolers are more capable than most adults of suspending disbelief and appreciating the message of love.     I was fist introduced to this book when my little brother -- 17 years younger than me -- took a liking to it. Truth be told, my mother loved it, and inspired his love for it with her enthusiasm. She liked to comment on how much the little boy in the story favored my brother. It made the story even more sentimental for them.    My mother unexpectedly passed away 9 months ago, and I have been unable to read this book since then. I have the old tattered copy that my mother read to my little brother, now 19. She gave it to me when my first daughter was a toddler. I now have three daughters -- 6, 3 and 8 months.     I have read this book to my own daughters in the past, and like other readers, I was often moved to tears. Today the story strikes me in such a visceral way that it is painful. I hope to be able to return to it someday -- with my own little girls and if the fates are willing, my grandchildren.    This is NOT a story about a creepy over-involved, over-protective mother. It's the story of all mothers. All parents. Your children grow. You grow old. We all change over time. But you never stop loving your children. You never stop worrying about them. You never lose the desire to embrace them and show them your love.     So, for those who have given this book a low rating... perhaps you aren't as easily turned to mush by the words of a book as some of us. If you don't remember ever being emotionally moved by a book, then you should probably heed the advice of these reviewers.     But if you can remember books that have made you tear up, struck a particular cord with you, then you may find this book as special as myself and many others.     Finally, I'll say that while I wish everyone was as open to interpretive story lines for young children, I understand that not everyone finds the appeal. The most important thing is really to read every day to your childen and to convey your love of reading. If you love the book, that makes it a lot easier.
0689835604|5.0|This book is one of my children's favoirte books.  They loved pulling down the flaps and seeing what was hidden.  It is also a fun way for them to learn their body parts.  A fun way to learn terms and concepts like \\"behind\\" and \\"underneath\\".  My children wanted to read it over and over again.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|I am 42 years old, and when I heard that this might be AC/DC's last album, I was hoping it would be good.  It exceeded all expectations!  In my opinion there are only two average songs on here, (Wheels & Decibel), the rest ROCK!  Not only are the songs good, they sound good.  None of that slick over production stuff like on Stiff Upper Lip and Ballbreaker.  Rock-n-Roll Dream and Anything Goes are great songs, that don't particularly sound like an AC/DC anthem, but they are definitely rockers, unlike what some other reviewers said about them.  If this album is their swan song, (which I would hate to see happen.) then they went out on top and they can be very proud of this effort.
B001GQACGO|1.0|Now I am a HUGE Beyonce fan but this album is absolute GARBAGE! This album seems rushed and put together without thinking. If she had 70 songs to choose from for this album then she chose 16 horrible tracks! Popa Knowles needs to sit down, retire and let someone take over the reigns. This is NOT a normal Beyonce CD and I am mortified! What is going on BEY!?! This is definitely not a good look. I can't even groove to anything on this album. Sasha Fierce is suppose to be her crazy \\"alter ego\\" then why the heck are majority of these songs ballads? The only songs I like on the album are \\"Single Ladies\\", \\"If I were a boy\\" and \\"Halo\\".. Damn Bey 3 out of 16 songs? Sad! Well you did one thing right.. You married Jigga! Thats the ONLY thing I can commend you on this year.     Here's a suggestion.. How about letting Sasha Fierce go? How about something simple? Like.. Ummm.. BEYONCE!??! Sasha Fierce didn't do it for me! Sorry. I'm not buying into this one Bey..     You need to go back to making good music instead of worrying about who's going to take your space in the game if you're aren't being heard on the radio. Take a break!! Let Keyshia Cole, Rihanna or Ciara take over for a while. You need to recuperate from this loss because you are definitely trying TOO hard!     And for the other customers reviewing this album with more than 3 stars, WHAT ALBUM WERE YOU LISTENING TO??!!
0345494768|5.0|[[VIDEOID:28947681]]While this book was published in 2007, it's actually about the making and the history of the first Star Wars movie released in 1977. Considering how much time has passed, it's amazing the amount of material that has been collected for this book.<br /><br />There are twelve chapters documenting the journey from the scripting stage, casting, set building, location shooting, all the way up to the movie release.<br /><br />This book is written before anyone knew it was going to be a major hit. What that means is, they are writing it on the spot at that point in time -- in 1977. There's nothing closer to understanding what's going on during production and on their minds while the shooting the movie.<br /><br />Included in the books are hundreds of behind-the-scenes photos, scanned scripts, sketches of sets and ships, several film stills and immensely valuable and insightful interviews. It's essentially a very well documented production diary.<br /><br />There are lots of details included. Read about how George Lucas was a compulsive writer who doesn't and cannot stop working. Find out how they overcome crisis like when one of their robots caught fire. Share their euphoria when they first received reactions from movie goers. And I can go on and on.<br /><br />This is the definitive volume. It's well worth the money for any Star Wars fan or movie maker.<br /><br />There are two covers for this book, a hardcover and the paperback. It's highly recommended to get the hardcover, more expensive, version. This book is big and thick at 314 pages. The spine of the softcover will most definitely wear off in the future.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|My only question is, will the BluRay disk work on existing players? The studios have a history of releasing disks with features they either forgot to tell the player manufacturers about, or the player manufacturers ignored. I have purchased BluRay disks and had to wait three months for an update from the player manufacturer in order for my player to play the disk. This is very frustrating, so much so I quit buying blu-ray disks until 3-6 months after their release so I would know the player will actually play the disk. The recent Bond disks are but one example of many.    My suggestion is to wait a few weeks after this is released before buying it, and read the reviews here or on one of the AV websites, just to be sure it will work on your player. Otherwise, you could be disappointed at Christmas by not being able to watch the movie.

B0002O7XW2|5.0|[[ASIN:B0002O7XW2 Christine (Special Edition)]]<br />During post-war, pre-inflation 1957, the Detroit assebly lines were the bread and butter of the American economy. It was a time of cheap Gas, plentiful steel, and an insatiable hunger for the dream-machines that were cranked out by the Big Three, FORD-GENERAL MOTORS-CHRYSLER. John Carpenter, opens the film in are-created Plymouth plant in Detroit, late 1957, where a singular red and white Fury rolls down the line amid the roar of machinery and the whine of air-tools. Finned, fitted, sleek and shiny, another new '58 is ready to cruise. The foreman is glad to see this one go. It has been trouble all the way down the line, killed a line worker - somehow even the air feels cold as the car goes by. Some cars are just - born bad. Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is the school - jerk. There's no getting around it. The minute you see the adhesive holding his glasses together, the moment the Garbage bag breaks all over the driveway, you know this guy.<br />Arnie Cunningham's parents refuse to let him keep the car, but the car already has a bad influence on him. He defies his parents and keeps the car at Darnell's Garage, where he starts working part-time to make enough money to restore it. John Carpenter is an accomplished musician and has scored many of his own films. For Christine he uses a selection of '50s and '60s rock and roll to puntuate the events and dialogue.<br />Carpenter is quoted to have said, \\"You can't take certain machines for granted. Ever. Not for a second. Or they will come and bite you\\"!
1400063515|2.0|Taleb wants to tell us about 'Black Swans' - highly improbable events that have a disproportionate impact - and the subject couldn't be more timely, in light of the global financial crisis, and especially in view of his (2006) comments on the precarious state of Fannie Mae. He makes the point that much statistical theory (and certainly economic modeling) assumes normally-distributed data, whereas the real world  (\\"Extremistan\\" in his parlance) contains significant outlier events that can create havoc with models - and, as we have seen, with shareholder value.    Another bonus is that he is widely-read, widely-traveled, and eclectic in his sources. So he should be worth listening to. Unfortunately, he spends most of the book telling us about himself, and in particular how only he and a select few academics (Benoit Mandelbrot comes in for particular praise) really 'get it' as far as probability is concerned. He is a self-described 'erudite' whose exotic background (Lebanese Greek Orthodox, with several languages) gives him special insight that more pedestrian practitioners lack. Taleb spends much of the book reiterating how fraudulent, foolish or ignorant most economists, mathematicians and philosophers are; and how 'NNT' - as he prefers to call himself - has, through his empirical work as an options trader and his wide reading, achieved insights that the Nobel laureates have missed. (Nobel laureates are especially scorned.)    Apart from the self-aggrandizing and repetitive nature of his prose, the book's main failings are that Taleb tries but does not succeed in making the case that stock-market returns are fractal in nature (sorry, Dr Mandelbrot - this was discredited some time ago), and he offers virtually no useful advice on the central problem he raises. That is, given that Black Swans are so far outside our normal experience that they cannot be readily modeled or predicted, how should be prepare ourselves for the worst (or the best)? Taleb's answer: think outside the box, pursue potentially 'good' Swans, and hedge against bad ones. Oh, and 'don't be a sucker'.     I was - I paid money for his book.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|The movie is great, but Amazon packages it in a mailer that says \\"Wall-E\\" in three different places! It also says \\"Disney\\" all over it, so I guess it's great for promotion, but I can think of reasons that buyers would not want the contents of their Amazon mailers labeled with what's inside. Guess whose kids figured out a Christmas present when they got the mail today?
B001EOQWEO|1.0|I Love this movie to death, but every copy i bought(i have bought seven of them. NO JOKE!)simply would not play! i beleve that the paper mix they are useing is some how hurting the disc. I am going to rent it from netflix to see if there is a diferance.
B000MGUZKM|4.0|Randy Crawford came my way by the unforgetable song \\"Street Life\\" when she performed on the album [[ASIN:B000003N56 Street Life]]. I have listened to her releases off and on since and feel this is a special release. She appears to be in top form, united with original  Crusader band member Joe Sample on keyboards for a mellow and at times dramatic presentation. There are echoes of the voice on \\"Street Life\\", like on \\"End of the Line \\" where her voice trails off and flows much like it did on that memorable song. The title track is a classic, that begins with a bouncy nu-bossa-nova-beat to introduce Randy's magnificently soulful pipes. Another song for which Randy is known is \\"Rio de Janeiro Blue.\\" She performs it here , an updated version with more improvisation but I prefer the more melancholy vesrion that can be found on other discs , including the extensive collection [[ASIN:B000002MZH Best of Randy Crawford]]. This is a laid back disc perfect for those relaxed moments or when you are trying to relax. She even does a nice job on the old pop hit \\"Everybody's Talking.\\" Least I forget, this is a colloboration and Joe Sample rips some nice melodies on the keyboeards but Randy's soulful musings are what make this colloboration special. She reminds me of Nina Simone or Sarah Vaughn at times and that is good company. She has good range that is eveident throughout the disc. She performs a soft , romantic type song entitled \\"Save Your Love For Me\\" where she comes across as the torch-burning-songstress-seductress. I love her voice, very nice mood music to put you in the mood. A highly recommended disc from one of the underrated contemporary female jazz singers.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|Awesome CD, awesome smooth voice.  I will be buying more of his music!  I've told everyone that I know about him.
015206396X|5.0|I LOVE it when you can watch a movie or read a book and it's SO well thought out and so unique that it can take you away to another place to simply chew on and enjoy.  Graceling does this! I could not put it down so unfortunately, laundry didn't get finished in the past couple of days!     Like other reviewers, I don't see a need to post details of the story line when so many others have...I PERSONALLY don't care for reviews on books when reviewers post details...SOME details turn out to be spoilers for me.      Graceling is not too long where it take eons to complete which is really nice but not too short where you feel short changed with details in the story and where it takes you.  My ONLY complaints are that...I do NOT and would not recommend it appropriate for 14yr olds...I think I'd lean more towards 17 or 18 years old.  Another is I would have liked to order more of the tattoos! My boys fought over it and keep asking me to buy more 'sword' tattoos!    It was exciting and romantic without being obviously 'mushy' romantic which I appreciated, full of 'girl power' without being cheesy.  I thought the author did an excellent job in allowing the main character, Katsa, 'evolve' into her own...strong character to match her physical strength.    I think this would make an excellent extra gift this Christmas - I appreciate having it and have plans to read it again!!  I'd highly recommend this for an older teen - young adult - adult...say 17-18+ female.
0316017922|2.0|At the end of the day, in the larger scheme of this thing we call life, this and the other books by Gladwell are a whole lot of nothing about nothing.  His perspective is just that.  His perspective.  Personal perspective is NEVER the truth.  Ever.  That's an easy concept to understand.  You might have to do some self research on the topic, but it's worth the time investment if you truly want to \\"find the truth\\".  And isn't that what most of are attempting to do anyway?      Any one of us can pull together enough data and string it together in the attempt to support our point of view or our argument.  That's traditional debate.  Most authors of these \\"types\\" of books use a debate type format to support their ideas.  And does that make them the firm foundation of truth?  I think not.    Why waste your time reading about his theories which add up to nothing and instead continue to live your life as it comes at you and succeed because it's firmly rooted and set in your mind to seek your own truth, and not some theory that someone else who just happended to find a publisher, discovered their \\"clever\\" side and now stand on the altar of self perception.    I sure hope we're a lot smarter than this.  Is this the continuation of the dumbing down of the World?  I think it is.  Why don't we start using our own ideas and form our own truths, which will ultimately make us and the world we happen to live in a better place.  More drivel from another \\"so called\\" expert, is.........nothingness and valueless!  It's actually limiting.  Is that what you're looking for?    Geez!
B001EOQWFI|1.0|Be very careful about purchasing the special 3-disc Blu-Ray set.  They had something go horribly wrong during the manufacturing.  Discs missing, unplayable, etc.  My first copy from Amazon had no feature film, two copies of the Bonus Disc 1, no Bonus Disc 2, and the Digital copy.  The second one from Amazon had no Bonus Disc 2.  Hopefully the third time is the charm.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I saw this at a local theater last summer and in the process of bouncing around in my seat to Mamma Mia that song song finished but the seat bouncing didn't.  It was an earthquake-what an omen?  I saw the stage production and was impressed with the energy and fun of the play.  I will get my own copy.
B000K4WPCC|1.0|i bought this movie when it first came out and got around to watching it i could have waited forever.This has to be the worst movie i have ever watched in my life.They forgot to write a story and do anything special with the special affects.They took a good idea for a movie and dropped the ball big time.do not buy this movie its a waste of time i want the 97 minutes of my life back i spent watching this turd.No there is nothing it its thats good
B000HIVO64|5.0|great CD, many of the songs here take awhile to grown on you like Soldier Jane (not my fav at first) but this is the genius of beck, that guys is such a chameleon.The DVD that came with it now, its uh..not anything great but its amusing to say the least, the guys went to thrift /costume store and made a bunch of crazy homemade videos that are just \\"out there\\".  Love the music tho!
B00003CXB4|1.0|Please do not buy this movie, it is anti-american and perpetuates a state where only the elite are well off and lower classes are discriminated agains.    1. The hyenas far outnumber the lions. Even though they wanted Scar as the 'president,' the only rightful rulers were from an elitist bloodline. Once Simba comes back, he throws Scar to his death, reminicent of the struggles of the persian Sultans of the 1600's. I do not want my children to learn such things.    2. There were two characters that could be identified as 'black' one of the hyenas, portrayed as low class, filthy and illeterate being. We are forced to hate this character and to chear at their misfortune. Also, you have the baboon, an outcast of society, just left alone to his own non-mainstream (white-society) world view. This shows unabridged bigotry.    4. The evil that is Disney. To try to create an artificial demand for their products Disney only does limited time releases of their movies before they go into the \\"vault\\". This way Disney forces your hand into buying their DVD's for fear of never having another chance to buy them again. If you think that is symbolic of a fair market then great, but I know that this ploy is not in place to help out consumers, it is there to squeeze out money from the little guys. Those who want it after it's in they 'vault' are forced into an unriliable and unsafe secondary market.    3. False advertising. Disney advertise a great new song for the DVD release. What they provided us with absolute garbage plain and simple.
B0007M22TI|1.0|Just a warning to anyone wanting to see this group live - I saw them in concert last year with a friend at the Greek Theatre and my pleasure at the singing and fiddle-playing quickly turned to disappointment at the obviously lyp-synced vocals and dubbed fiddle.  Their CDs are probably wonderful, but their live performances are apparently not live at all.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Wow is all I can say! I love David Cook so much and was ecstatic when he won American Idol. This cd does not disappoint!! I loved every second of it. Man his voice just makes me melt =D. Hes so cute too <3  Yes I am a fangirl and Im proud of it :D
045122499X|2.0|Why would such an excellent writer feel compelled to write soft-porn sex scenes in otherwise terrific historical fiction? It just ruined the whole book for me.
B001FBJULI|4.0|Look at the dates on the reviews.  I think only one review so far is about the remastered cd set - and it flags several problems with the remastering. There is no word on sound quality (otherwise) of the remastered disc (sometimes \\"remasters\\" sound about the same as the older cheaper discs).<br /><br />Reader beware.....
B001ACH4DS|4.0|So I decided to actually write a CD review of my new favorite record and put it out there into cyberspace. Unless, you have been hiding under a rock, you have heard the name David Cook. I am what you would call a die hard fan of his since his appearance on the show back in the spring. So I was very excited to hear his major label debut record. (His second overall because he release an indie record Analog Heart in 2006.) So here it goes.     This record overall is very eclectic. Ir has some power ballad, a gritty rock song and a piano ballad. I really think that this record has something that will peak many musical tastes. Personally, I would have liked a little more edge but I understand why he chose the songs he did. If I had to pick two favorite tracks, it would have to be \\"Bar ba sol\\" and \\"Permanent\\" These two songs are the two extremes from the record. \\"Bar ba sol\\" is a very heavy, gritty song which I love to blare in my car. Then we have \\"Permanent\\" which is a bare piano,strings and vocal ballad written about Cook's brother who is battling brain cancer. I cried when I first heard it and still get goosebumps when I hear it.     Now on the art of the power ballad. I am in my 20s but I have a great appreciate for great 80s power ballads. I think David has crafted some great mid=tempo power ballads. \\"Declaration\\" and \\"A Daily AntheM\\" are two of my favorites and I really think they will get some commercial airplay. Also, the single \\"Light On\\" is a great piece that was penned by Chris Cornell. It has alot of rock influences and is a great song that I think will stand up over time. It has not been performing that well on the Top 40 charts but I think people will remember it. Besides rocks stars sell albums not singles.     Some of the other critics out there have called his CD \\"predictable\\" or \\"Daughtry 2.0.\\" I think they are way off. In my humble opinion, I think he is a breath of fresh air to hit pop/rock in a long time. He has a great set of pipes and is a great performer. I think his album is quintessentially him and can stand on its own. Chris Daughtry did help pave the way for him on Idol but musically they are different people. Interestingly, I looked back at some review of Daughtry's debut and some of the same things were said. Some called him \\"a Nickelback ripoff\\" or \\"generic\\". All I have to say is that David Cook is a great live performer and Nickelback is not. Part nof what makes a great rock artist is great live performances. So there you go. I give this record an A- and 4 stars.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|I am a big fan of the comic and of the first movie. I must say that this movie rocked! It was excellent and I loved it from beginning to end. Johann Krauss was a hilarious addition to the BPRD!!!
B000EQ5SRK|2.0|As Carly Norris said: \\"You like to watch, watch this!\\"<br /><br />But seriously, don't watch this, unless you are fascinated by train wrecks, and enjoy seeing a movie spin totally out of control. Joe Eszterhas has recently been born again, after a bout with throat cancer he has given up tobacco, booze, writing trashy but successful scripts, and instead he's taken up the cross. I wish him luck. So far, he has yet to sell any scripts, but he has written a few books. Looking over his oeuvre, there are some successes and some spectacular failures. I'll get to 'Sliver' in a minute, but first a brief recap:<br /><br />'Flashdance' was rather ridiculous in premise, nevertheless, a huge success. 'Jagged Edge' I haven't seen, but from the afterbuzz I sense that it was a taut courtroom drama that may have been ridiculous in premise, but was no doubt entertaining. 'Music Box' may have been the rare Eszterhas film that was both serious, well received by critics and public alike. The story of a daughter who discovers that her father was a Nazi may have resonated for Eszterhas due to personal reasons. 'Basic Instinct' was very trashy, but it worked, even though you knew you were being manipulated, you liked it. Admit it, you did. A guilty pleasure--and Sharon Stone's interrogation scene? It made a big impact. If you have seen it, you remember it, and if you haven't seen it, you've heard about it. 'Showgirls' won several Razzies and is renowned for being one of the worst films of all time. It was supposed to be a box office bomb, but actually it is the highest grossing NC-17 film of all time, probably from DVD sales I would surmise. 'Jade' is notoriously bad. David Caruso quit a lucrative TV career to make this, and his film career went nowhere and he's back on the small screen. Finally, 'An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn' ended Eszterhas' screen writing career. It is ironic, because \\"Alan Smithee\\" is a name that directors use when they make a movie so bad that they don't want to have their name attached to it, and the film was about a director who made a bad film and didn't want his name attached to it, but his name actually was Alan Smithee, so he did not have that option. Further irony is piled on by the fact that \\"Alan Smithee\\" as a pseudonym was retired after this movie because the name became too well known, so it was no longer effective as a subterfuge when trying to duck responsibility for a project gone wrong. Like the film within a film, 'An Alan Smithee film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn' itself was also a disaster, and Eszterhas' career took a nosedive. No more multi million dollars for ideas he pitched at lunch or scribbled on a napkin.<br /><br />Which brings us to 'Sliver,' another disaster. Nothing left but to dissect the cadaver. Based on a book by Ira Levin, who also wrote Rosemary's Baby, The Boys from Brazil, and The Stepford Wives, Ira was reluctant to sell the film rights because Hollywood always trampled on his dreams. The one exception was Rosemary's Baby, which was directed by Roman Polanski. Producer Robert Evans sent Ira a book by Polanski with the passages where he (Evans) had saved the project highlighted, and this convinced him to let Evans produce 'Sliver.' Unfortunately, Polanski was forced to leave the country, and though at first they planned to film a few exterior shots in New York and have Roman finish it up in Paris; it ended up being directed by Philip Noyce. Though he was no Polanski, Noyce was no hack, as proved by 'The Quiet American;' but he was unable to salvage 'Sliver.'<br /><br />For a movie with such a titillating premise, 'Sliver' managed to extract all the juice. For a movie about high tech voyeurism, it sure managed to turn down the heat. Though 'Basic Instinct' was trashy, it was much more fun. In 'Instinct' there is a kind of cat and mouse, love/hate thing going with Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. She is a murder suspect/novelist, and he is the cop investigating her. Talk about good cop, bad cop, he is a very bad cop. He shoots tourists, and has numerous bad habits. Stone plays him like a Stradivarius, pushing his buttons, making him dance to her tune, and all the while, he thinks he is in control. Total trash, but the audience, like Douglas, is also played like a Stradivarius. The Sharon Stone of 'Sliver' has no chemistry with either Tom Berenger or William Baldwin.<br /><br />'Sliver' doesn't deliver on any of its promises, and it squanders its titillating premise. It also botches the ending, because focus groups found the first ending incomprehensible. Eszterhas wrote five new endings in three days, but the one they picked changed the killer and tried to make sense of the botched attempt, and failed again. It makes no sense. Don't want to spoil it by revealing the ending, but it would be hard to spoil it any more than the writer, director, producer, and actors have already. Neither Ira Levin, Joe Eszterhas, the critics, film audiences, nor Tom Berenger were pleased with the result. I tend to agree with them.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00008L3T0 Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn]] (1998) (written by Joe Eszterhas)<br />[[ASIN:6305278024 Jade]] (1995) (written by Joe Eszterhas)<br />[[ASIN:0792844882 Showgirls]] (1995) (written by Joe Eszterhas)<br />[[ASIN:B0000JCFPE Basic Instinct]] (1992) (written by Joe Eszterhas, and Sharon Stone was Catherine Tramell)<br />[[ASIN:B00008RV0G Music Box]] (1989) (written by Joe Eszterhas)<br />[[ASIN:0767821742 Jagged Edge]] (1985) (written by Joe Eszterhas)<br />[[ASIN:B00005JKG5 Flashdance]] (1983) (screenplay by Joe Eszterhas)<br />[[ASIN:B00005JN75 Looking for Mr. Goodbar]] (1977) ....

B001ACH4DS|5.0|This long awaited CD was well worth waiting for.  No disappointment with any part of this CD.      Enjoying it so the MAX.  I can't believe that it took America Idol to discover him.  I could listen to him all day.
B00023B1LC|5.0|These Bourne movies rock my world. You know THE BOURNE IDENTITY and subsequent sequels are so bad. The Bourne movies are so bad they got James Bond to change almost everything about himself except his name. And James Bond probably didn't change his name because he at least has the same initials as Jason Bourne. Seriously they knocked it out of the park with the Bourne films. Don't know which is 'the best' one. Hard to say. Nobody's better than Paul Greengrass (director of the sequels) at doin the realer than real life thing, but Bourne Identity is the first and has the most engrossing story to tell. And 'Shaky cam' is cool, but in much smaller doses than are invariably used. They go over board with the shaky cam. But not here. All that goes overboard is Bourne as he gets shot up and falls off a boat, floats in the sea to be rescued by Italian fishermen, and then goes on a balls-out --- kicken mission to find out who in the world he is. On the way, goes all over cinematic Europe, picks up a pretty German girl, outwits everybody and their mother, and puts on the ground all that get in his way including other elite assassin agents from his own unit. You very quickly understand this dude is like the ultimate bad ---. But here's the kicker -he feels bad about it. This 'action thriller' adventure hero -or make that anti-hero?- has a conscience. Interesting. He actually thinks that it's wrong to kill people as a tool of the government. The Bourne movies are all a step up in action/spy thriller film making. They showed how to do it well and do it intelligently.
B0018CWESK|4.0|This was a  good movie. Lots of action and great Dialogue.  The best lines..     Just as the vampire harpy is about to kill ANNA  ( Kate Beckinsle)  Aleera: Anna, my love. It is your blood that shall keep me beautiful. What do you think of that?   [laughs triumphantly, then screams as Anna catches a silver stake and impales her through the chest]   Anna Valerious: I think if you're going to kill somebody, kill them! Don't stand around talking about it!     Overall a  good movie. I hope they make a  sequel!
B0014DZ2VO|2.0|Ah, so I see I'm not the only one disapointed... Yes, I'm affraid this one is a step down from CASINO ROYALE. There are more than a couple issues here: the film was not shot well, written well or edited well. The story started off promising. I was interested in Bond uncovering the truth about this scary orginization that has people everywhere. But it doesn't really go anywhere. Well Bond goes all over and it's hard to keep up, cause of editing really, but you do have the names of each exotic locale written on the screen for you each time just like your looking at a post card. I want to say I'm weary of poorly shot action sequences -I think THE DARK KNIGHT was the last movie I saw in the theater which would make this the second time I was put off by a confused, jumbled mess on the screen. I don't mean the shaky cam, but that too. It reminds me of some other recent movies... Along with most folks I've really appreciated the new Daniel Craig Bond but he needs a better filmed movie and a better script. One highlight is the big diss served up to the CIA! Lol. Great stuff. I read a column in my newspaper by a rightwing idealogue that mocked the idea that the CIA does naughty things like interfere with foreign governments and help to overthrow them on occasion. Or help bring a corrupt puppet regime to power. Amazing. (If you want a good overview of this type of thing take a look at a book called _Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq_ published in 2006 by award-winning New York Times foreign correspondent and author Stephen Kinzer.) But I do think they're getting a little too far away from the character of the orginal Sean Connery films. Btw, you hear about the Matt Damon's opinion? Not everybody buys the new Bond (lol). Check it:<br /><br />Interviewer: I think that a lot of people see these movies as what Bond movies should be, and that's why the most recent Bond took a darker, more realistic turn.<br />Matt Damon: But the characters are so fundamentally different.<br />Interviewer: Well, they're both action movies, they have exotic, globe-trotting locales, and they're espionage movies...<br />Damon:Well, yeah. But I mean, James Bond is an imperialist, misogynist guy who slurps martinis and ------- laughs and kills people and cracks jokes. Whereas Bourne is this tortured serial monogamist whose girlfriend is dead and [he] won't look at another woman and carries tremendous guilt and shame about the things he's done.<br />Interviewer: But that's exactly how they made the latest James Bond.<br />Damon: I didn't see it. I bumped into Pierce Brosnan and he was like, ''You can't update the character because he's a character of the '60s.''

0930289234|5.0|I found this book at target and i have to say that at first it overwhelmed me a little bit. After about an hour i couldn't stop reading it. It is very suspenseful. The ending totally blew my mind.
6304779356|5.0|I purchase this dvd for my daughter who is a big goosebump fan, I remember this movie being a big hit when I was growing up, since I could not remember all the parts, I screen the movie first,before letting my 8yr old watch it, and thought it would be fine, it did not have any nudity, or sexual scenes except for one part which was very minor compare to whats on T.V today, there is one part of the movie that is a little gruesum, but it goes so fast it dosent have much impact. There is alot of humor which softens the movie, saying all that,  my daughter absolutely loves this movie, she has watch it over 10times, I think she has a crush on David (Keifer Sutherland). I hate to have to disapoint her and tell her that David is all grown up now.  If you are consider getting this for a younger child please view it first, every child is different, I thought it was a great movie, but I know I couldnt show this to some of my childs friends.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|My family and I LOVED this movie!  It is very well made, with great characters and storyline -- an overweight panda who dreamed of being a kung fu master!  Of course it's silly -- do you know of any pandas who can cook noodle soups?  And of course there'll be punching and kicking -- it's a kung fu movie after all!  The movie had several memorable scenes.  One of my favorite scene was the one where the panda came puffing up the stairs to save his mentor.  Gash, if I had to climb that many stairs, I'd be puffing away, too!  LOVE that panda!  Jack Black did very well as Po.  The other memorable role belongs to Dustin Huffman as his unwilling mentor.  I also learned a thing or two about the past, the present and the future, but I won't give it away.  See the movie.  Two thumbs WAAAAY up!
0739368257|5.0|What a fabulous tale!<br /><br />Having read all of Garth Nix's trilogy ('Sabriel', 'Lirael' and 'Abhorsen'), as well as his collection of short stories 'Tales From Across The Wall', and having enjoyed them all thoroughly, I was thrilled to find 'Sabriel' available on CD, read by the legendary Tim Curry beautifully narrating such a dark and intriguing story. A fantastic tale detailing the life of a young girl with a dark path set out in front of her for which she is not prepared and only half willing to follow, it is a must read/hear for children and adults alike. I pre-ordered it as soon as I found it due for release, shipping it all the way over to the UK, and I am eagerly awaiting the release of 'Lirael' and 'Abhorsen' on CD so I can sit back and enjoy them as much as I continue to enjoy 'Sabriel'.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|It's too bad that the movie was pushed as a classic Indiana Jones film. It's not. It plays off the others, but the story is lousy. The Fate of Atlantis would have been a much better story. The effects are too computerized. They look too smooth. It looks more like toy story than good artistic filming & effects.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|It's no secret that debut albums from American Idol winners (and runners-up) are typically assembly-line productions that are rushed to market with pre-processed hits and little to no input from the artists themselves.  But 'David Cook' the album stands out (much as the man himself did on the show) as clearly the most introspective and eclectic debut ever to come from the Idol franchise.      Cook himself wrote or co-wrote 10 of the 12 tracks on the album, and the lyrics are extremely personal and raw, touching on the support of his family, dealing with loss, and the inner-conflict that comes with sudden fame.      Cook has proven himself to be an extremely versatile vocalist, but the focus here seems to be on highlighting the arena-filling upper range of Cook's voice, which is so searing it can make the hair on your neck stand on end.  But there are a few delicate moments where Cook is able to utilize the rich timbre that sets him apart from many other rock vocalists.  One such song is the standout track \\"Permanent\\" (written for his brother who is fighting brain cancer) - it features just piano, strings, and a tender and wrenching vocal.  He also moves effortlessly into his lovely falsetto for 'Avalanche,' one of the more straightforward love ballads on the record.      On the other end of the spectrum is the driving urgency of the heavy riff-rocker Bar-ba-Sol, which is probably the best track on the record. Cook is a born performer who commands the stage and knows how to work both the camera and the crowd.  Bar-ba-Sol plays to this strength - it is a song that demands to be heard live with a beer in hand.      It's obvious that some compromises had to be made in order to satisfy the 30 million fans who watched him sing covers on Idol every week.  There are a few fairly generic pop-rock tunes ('I Did it For You' and 'Come Back to Me' most notably) which may ultimately become big hits in the Daughtry mold.  But produced by the highly-respected Rob Cavallo, the albumis for the most part a cohesive rock record with several songs that are both representative of the artist as well as radio-friendly.  In addition to those mentioned above, I particularly like 'Lie,' 'Declaration,' 'Life on the Moon,''Light On' (co-written by Chris Cornell), and the rough and sexy easter-egg track 'Kiss on the Neck' which appears after several minutes of silence following the strong closer 'A Daily AntheM'.      Under the circumstances (written and recorded in just 10 weeks while in the midst of a 53-city tour), the album is an imperfect but nonetheless impressive debut from the clearly talented Cook.  I look forward to seeing him continue to break the Idol mold and stretch even further on his next record.
0316017922|4.0|I have to give Malcolm Gladwell a hefty pat on the back for his attempt to capture the essence of success in Outliers: The Story Success.  I also have to commend him for stressing the point that hard work, and to a degree, luck, is required to be successful.  I spotted that tidbit while scanning through the book and decided that perhaps there was something here after all.<br /><br />Gladwell may turn out to be this generation's Studs Terkel in that he has a need to look at subjects the rest of us take for granted.<br /><br />I do have just a wee bit of a problem with his reluctance to ask questions about the studies he quotes.  I also think that when Gladwell hits upon an idea that seems to work as an explanation for a conclusion (Asian math prowess and raising rice) he stops there; giving virtually no thought to the subject beyond that point.  For example we've been growing rice in this country for centuries.  Shouldn't we be equally advanced in mathematics as students of Asian ancestry?  Why aren't we? Perhaps in something similar to the 10,000 hour rule we need to raise rice for another thousand years before we accrue any benefits from that activity.  Obtuse?  I don't think so.<br /><br />When you look at Mozart, Oppenheimer, or any of the others cited, no one can argue that they were not world class successes; in one narrow aspect of their lives.  Most were also miserable failures in other parts of their lives.  Einstein was an absolute failure as a father and husband.  Oppenheimer was disgraced by the American government.  Mozart died in misery.  Point to any successful personality and then take a second look.<br /><br />Success comes from talent, intelligence, and a lot of hard work.  I also very much like that Gladwell sees human workers as the backbone to corporate success even stressing that companies should invest in workers as a resource.  This is an idea that is not new but has been floating around for fifty or sixty years.  Perhaps, in the present economic debacle corporate leaders will begin to heed it.<br /><br />The truth of the matter is that despite my problems with Outliers, I'm giving it four stars because it is a book that provokes thought, and we need a lot more of that in our society.  Gladwell is an entertaining writer/researcher/thinker.  I thought his book Tipping Point should be considered for book of the decade. Outliers, while not quite up to that level of quality is sure to be a successful book.  Finally, Gladwell should be congratulated for turning out books like Tipping Point and Outliers.  I may not agree with all of his conclusions but at least he's asking the right questions.<br /><br />I recommend.<br /><br />Peace alwayswill begin to heed it.

B001GQACGO|2.0|Wow what an awful album. We must have alot of Bey stans on amazon because aint no way this album is worth 5 stars or $14.99 considering the fact she will re release it in a few months anyway. Tracks like Halo, Single ladies and Diva are my ish, but that's all. I didnt buy it for If I was a boy because I like BC Jean's  version better. I feel duped into buying fake double cd. Who has a double cd with 16 songs on it come on Bey? I am a fan but this just is not right.
B00160TDBA|5.0|This is a wonderful recording indeed (though I too have reservations about Vishnevskaya's contribution).    But: I would avoid downloading it in MP3 form, since (most unusual for Amazon) the tracks do not join smoothly: when one track should smoothly connect with the next, you can almost always hear a little burp (for want of a better word) when the new track is starting. This can be annoying.
B00005UDFZ|5.0|I just watched this on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt and was mesmerized. Wonderful to see a wilder side to Lennie, to listen to the heart melting songs, to see Jose struggle with the rapid fire English lyrics and the thrilling orchestra. I rarely buy DVDs given how easy it is to rent or download these days but I bought this one.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|In my opinion this is the best CD of 2008.  I also saw them live last night and they were phenominal so I may be riding a little high from that amazing show.  I have read the comparisons to Against Me!, Springsteen, and the Killers and I do hear a mix of influence from all of these artists.  I also hear a lot of down to earth originality with the lyrics.  All of the songs on this album are awesome.  The album flows together nicely with a variety of songs.  I recommend all of their music.  I think I have all of their songs that I can possibly have and there is not one bad song in the bunch.  Also go out and support this band at their live shows.  They put on an awesome show and they are a very humble and down to earth band.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I am not the biggest Nickel Fan, have all their albums but to be honest do not hear the entire album, but, when I got Dark Horse I let it play during the whole Internet surfing session and let me say that i Liked all of the song on this one. Most are so powerful and deep, that it really made me repeat it for at least 4 time last night. Best songs are : Something in your mouth, Gotta be somebody, I'd Come For you, I today was... Burn it to... and the best of all as a ballad, IMHO, For me, and deep slow songs fans, Never gonna be alone.
B001F2W4Y2|2.0|Black Ice has all the usual AC DC sound & imagery.  It's competent but not memorable.  There are no \\"classic\\" songs on this album.  Once the years go by this album will be forgotten.  Eg in the same way the Stones' A Bigger Bang sank without a trace in the fullness of time.    It's an album I listen to in the background & it's great to have these guys still around doing it, but it's nothing to get excited about.  The  last great AC DC album was The Razor's Edge.  They still play very very well & the recording quality is great, but the creative juices have gone.  And that's not unexpected or unreasonable given their age.    I hope to see AC DC on tour next year.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS SOUNDTRACK NOT KNOWING A SINGLE SONG, OR EVEN KNOW ANY OF THE ARTISTS, WELL MAYBE JUST ONE. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING I HAVEN'T TAKEN IT OUT OF MY CD PLAYER YET, IT IS AMAZING. THE BEST MOVIE SOUNDTRACK I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANY \\"TWILIGHT\\" FANS OUT THERE.
0452289963|5.0|This moving and transformational books offers real-life, concrete solutions to managing the stress of modern living.  Where traditional therapy ends (understanding the \\"why\\" behind our misery) Mr. Tolle's book and mindfulness begin, by teaching the \\"how\\".  How to find meaning in the present moment. How to stop looking for happiness in external things.  How to learn to appreciate the true self and live a life of intention and kindness.  Mr. Tolle gives the reader a wonderful introduction to Buddhist and mindfulness principals, and he also shows how all the major religions are more alike than they are different.  His book is an inclusive, welcoming, and loving invitation to change the lens through which you see yourself and life.  Highly recommended.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|This is a wonderful CD and Anna Maria Jopek has the perfect voice to bring vocals to Pat's music.  If you are a true fan of Pat and Anna Maria, go out and get this CD.  A true fan of PM would not have to listen to this first before buying and anyone giving this CD a 1 Star rating has no concept of what music brings to us all.  *****
B000127LW2|4.0|I'll keep this short, since this was a short season (they deferred several episodes to season 2).   Season 1 is kind of a mixed bag.  The show starts out with a lot of promise, and there is better to come.  However, I think the last couple of episodes are a let-down.  The season definitely ended with a whimper.    There were several good episodes, but overall the show does not have the strength that it will in later seasons.  Chiefly among my complaints is that the 2-hour opener is badly paced in some places and some of the plots seem recycled or very generic.  For a show that is supposed to be about being alone with a potentially hostile crew, many of the episodes seemed like they forgot that.    What really saves the show is two things.  First, the Holographic Doctor (Robert Picardo) is great.  Second, the show does have a good cast and they really do gel together well.  The first season lays the foundation for things to come, and I have to say that the cast was very good through-out the seven year run.    One final comment.  Lower the price since this is 15/16 episodes compared to future seasons!  Paramount is making enough off this series, so this should be lower than the other seasons.
B0001XALTG|4.0|This is a story about a bunch of stupid losers, who have nothing at the center of their lives, so they became addicts, drunks, and thieves.  What is amazing about it is how blackly funny they all are, as they dive into toilets, allow babies and friends to die, burst into violent rages, and seek some kind of fantastical out.  The acting is so good that you can believe all of their chaotic lives that can go nowhere but down or prison.  Will the narrator turn his life around with his latest scan and last chance?  You assume so, but don't know.<br /><br />Recommended.  Cult classic.  And that young Ian McGregor!  First rate.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I have to agree with several other reviewers of this album.  I bought the CD last week mainly for \\"Viva La Vida,\\" which I think is one of the best songs Coldplay has ever done.  The first time around, I listened straight through, and didn't really care for many of the other songs.  However, after listening to it again yesterday, I'm totally hooked.  I'm not sure what did it, but I can't get enough of this album.  It's not \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" but then again, I don't think Coldplay will ever have another album like that one.  Be sure to give this one another chance if you didn't like it at first.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I think this album is just great.  Good lyrics, good sound, and good voice.  It is just the way I would want David Cook's first album to sound like.  Light On is written well by Chris Cornell.  Lie is one of the best songs.  I think it is so cool that he help write so many of the songs because that is not always the case with today's artists.  Every song is great to my ears.  I can not wait for more to come from Mr. Cook.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Why would you buy this version if you can buy the singe packs for $40 each.  Is there a difference?    Being a Trekkie, this version is beautiful and I for one don't really care one way or the other about the additional special effects.  (I am not a purist)
B000001F95|5.0|Truly beautiful electric guitar and flute music.  This doesn't sound like a soundtrack at all - more like a very special arrangement of sweet and bittersweet folksongs.  Mark Knopfler has a real talent for portraying character with music.  You'd never know he's a rocker from listening to this, but I can't imagine anyone with a folksy bent coming up with such a beautiful melding of acoustic and electronic sounds.
B00066VUPM|5.0|Has all of their best hits.  If you want an album that has most of their greatest hits till now, get this.  It also has a few extra tracks that haven't been on their other albums.    I love Travis!  Buy it now! :)    If you like Coldplay, Keane or other melodic British rock groups check this out.
0618918248|2.0|What is important to remember is that this is a book of opinions.  Surprisingly, mostly ranting opinions that verge on savage intolerance.  The book is all about self-arrogance and grand opinion...  not much else.  Regardless of the rhetoric, if the author can explain where or how the Big Bang came about, then I may lend him an ounce of credibility.  Until then - none at all.  He simply does not know anything for sure.
B000000W3G|3.0|This is an admirable collection of rarities from the Mellon Collie sessions, sure to make any Pumpkinite very happy, though fans not belonging in the obsessed category might want to stick with their  better B-sides set Pices Iscariot, as this five disc set tends to cover everything else they ever considered, including mostly stripped down, demo-like takes, many times echoing Corgan's solo work due to his lone input on some tracks. Whenever the throwaway vibe becomes too consistent, the band always manages to throw in just enough interesting material to keep listeners intrigued.
B000001E21|4.0|Very good cd and I have to admit the cover, which looks like a skull if seen from a distance, intrigued me. I have been a fan of DL since Pyromania and I never forget to mention to young listeners ( I am a DJ for internet radio station Gorean's Portal Radio) about the trials and tribulations the band members have gone through as well as Rick Allen's Unique method of drumming.
0439023483|5.0|I read this book in one night!  I was unable to put it down, and as soon as I did, my 12 year old daughter picked it up and read it.  The story line, characters and imagination in the setting is all amazing.  I can't wait for the next book to hit the shelf!
0810979772|5.0|My 9-yo is a voracious reader and loved Kinney's two \\"Wimpy Kid\\" books. When he asked me for this at our school book-fair a few days ago, I was really against it because I figured he'd read what was there and that would be it. But for $5 for the paperback, even a slight chance he would write in it was worth it.     This is a boy who is almost done with the Harry Potter series - reading is not a problem. But getting him to WANT to put pencil to paper is a challenge, and that translates into a lot of painful school nights getting homework done.    Turns out the secret to getting a kid who hates to write to get some practice is a good running start and fart jokes. He's picked it up every day, and though he struggles with his penmanship and getting ideas out of his head, he has really used this! I don't think he'll be journaling regularly any time soon, but I think even the past few days of comic strip writing and other activities has been well worth the 5 bucks.     Kinney is a genius!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I became a Metallica fan, as a teenager. I think Ride the lightning and Master of Puppets are two of the best metal albums of all time, and Justice is quite good too. Kill em all and Metallica had their good moments too, but one was full of songs that sounded alike, and the other was too poppy. I viewed load-reload-disc1 of garage inc, with a little more of an open mind than some, but they were even poppier. I kind of view them as another band. What got me to quit on them was them suing their fans and everyone else they could. Never paid for this one, got it from a friend. They are definately money grubbing bastards, but damn if they can't come up with some good music. We won't get into st anger which I can't believe people paid money for.<br /><br />This one's actually a good album. At least the first half. The musicianship is solid, all the way through. The vocals aren't too bad, he'll never be able to top the lightning puppets days, but that's ok. The sound of the guitars reminds me of Megadeth, but I can't remember which album, I'm thinking Rust In Piece, in sound not style. This is far and away the most energetic album they've come out with since Justice, and it might be the most energetic album I've listened to this year, of albums that have come out. The drumming's pretty good, who knew lars could still play? The guitar work is great. Hearing it made me want to listen to the old ones. I'm reluctantly re-adding them to my music collection. My problem mostly being them suing people, not selling out.<br /><br />My only complaints would be for one the production, as many have mentioned. I noticed the clipping, not enough to make me stop listening. Metal has never been a genre for good production, look as Black Sabbath's Ozzy years. Also the second half is noticibly weaker than the first. I have trouble remembering these songs still.<br /><br />That Was Just Your Life 8/10 Starts with a slow intro before erupting into a song full of thrashy goodness. This has to be the fastest song they've come up with since the And Justice album. Some great riffs, decent vocal performance, actually a decent rhythm section.<br /><br />The End Of The Line 9/10 QUICKLEY becoming one of my favorite songs of the year, definately top 2 on this album. It has a nice flow to it, another heavy song. It's slower than the last, which isn't saying much considering that one's quite fast. I love the pace of this one.<br /><br />Broken, Beat & Scarred 7/10 I really didn't like this one the first couple listens, but it's growing on me. It's another up-tempo song, it can get a little repetative, but it's still good.<br /><br />The Day That Never Comes 7/10 This one's ok. It's the first slower song, but for once it's not poppy. I like the clean guitar riff in the verses. The chorus is a little weak, but it's servicible. It gets heavier towards the middle and never lets up again.<br /><br />All Nightmare Long 9/10 My other favorite on here. Nice slower intro, bursting into another great thrasher. Love the vocal melodies in the chorus. I'm a sucker for a good chorus. The verses are only ok, but the chorus and solo make up for it.<br /><br />Cyanide 5 or 6/10 I'm not sure yet. I have trouble remembering this one. This one's slower than the other heavy songs, still has some fast parts. Musically I like it, but the song itself doesn't do a lot for me. I like that it's a change of pace.<br /><br />The Unforgiven III 7/10 I guess. Another unforgiven? Really? Did we need another? As another reviewer said it doesn't resemble the others. They could've called it something else. It starts with a piano intro, which is kind of wierd on here. It's well played though. Then we get some clean guitars before the electric guitars and the verses kick in. It's a slower song. The chorus is softer. I'm still letting this one grow on me. I enjoy the guitar solo.<br /><br />The Judas Kiss 7/10 The intro kind of reminds me a bit of sad but true, part of it anyway. It quickly becomes afaster song though. Some more nice riffs. The chorus is decent, but once it loses it's rhythm it lags on a bit. Overall this one's growing on me.<br /><br />My Apocalypse 5/10 I don't really like this one as much. It's ok, but that's about it. The drum beat in the verses is kind of annoying, and I'm not a fan of Hetfield's vocals in the chorus. The bridge is ok. It's definately another faster one.<br /><br />I gave the instrumental a pass, because I'm not a fan of instrumentals. I'm sure it's well played though.<br /><br />Overall it's a pretty good album, one of the better metal releases of the year. The fact that it's a metal album is amazing in it's own right, they haven't put one out since Justice. Heck it's amazing compared the everything they came out with in the 90's, and st anger. If you like their 80's stuff then don't pass this one up.ce it loses it's rhythm it lags on a bit. Overall this one's growing on me.     My Apocalypse 5/10 I don't really like this one as much.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|The remixes and remastering are great.  Haven't got to the DVD's yet, but those look equally rich with content.  The packaging is also very well done. I haven't bought a CD in over 2 years, but only having digital copies of these would be missing out on over half the content (videos, liner notes, written stories). Very well done.
1416594884|5.0|If one reads the 90-odd reviews of A MOST WANTED MAN posted on Amazon, it quickly becomes obvious that one's view of this book has more to do with one's politics than with the merits of the book.  I do not pretend to be the exception that proves that rule. Having said that, I believe A MOST WANTED MAN is a great book from the greatest writer of espionage novels in the English language.    For 47 years, John LaCarre has been telling us fascinating stories that put human faces (often unattractive human faces)on the people who work in the clandestine intelligence agencies of the western world.  A MOST WANTED MAN is one of his bleakest.  I recommend it highly.
B000KGGLCU|1.0|I like much of the music on the studio version of Madonna's Confessions On a Dance Floor; the production quality was high, the music itself was GREAT, and the lyrics were more moral than usual for Madonna. But the DVD in this set is over the top.<br /><br />You'll like the DVD if you enjoy:<br /><br />1. Rampant homages to S & M and other sexual deviance. At least once she kisses one of the female dancers. Another time she puts her hand down the front of her pants then licks off her finger.<br /><br />2. Young women pretending to pummel and otherwise physically assault men who are supposedly their husbands.<br /><br />3. Repeated cursing from the stage, and multiple displays of 'the finger.'<br /><br />4. A terrible crass reference by the singer to President Bush's private parts. Completely disrespectful and disgusting.<br /><br />5. Seeing Madonna on a stylized cross while wearing a crown of thorns. What's the message here? She's the Messiah b/c she makes a five minute appeal to help orphans? That appeal was indeed a valid one, and the Scripture she posted on the jumbotron screens to back up the plea was fitting; yet the context in which the request to help \\"the least of these\\" was made served to undermine her point.<br /><br />6. Political commentary from the stage video--why not just play music and leave politics out of it?
B001EO2UKO|3.0|Having been a super fan of Dido's debut album NO ANGEL, I was only slightly disappointed with the follow-up LIFE FOR RENT which contained some great tracks and few less-inspiring songs. With her latest album SAFE TRIP HOME, Dido reveals that her key strengths (catchy melodies, distinctive and pleasing voice, and earnest lyricism) are still intact. Nevertheless, STH suffers from a \\"muting\\" effect throughout--basically the songs are of a same or similar tempo, the instrumentation is leisurely and the delivery is all rainy-afternoon laden. I would definitely classify this as \\"adult-contemporary.\\" While the album is worth purchasing and has moments of inspiration, the tracks tend to meld into a lengthy, ruminating sort of experience. There are no real uptempo (SAND IN MY SHOES) or even slightly rockin'(DON'T THINK OF ME) numbers to fill out the album. I think  the fact that Jon Brion took over key production from Rollo (her brother, and an electronica wizard) resulted in a watered-down version of what could have been a great album. Still, it is a solid record on the whole and should be appreciated be Dido (and maybe Carpenter) fans.
0143112724|5.0|I wish I could remember who originally recommended the original Strunk & White Elements of Style to me. If I could remember, I would find them and hug them unabashedly.<br /><br />If you're writing ANYTHING and care AT ALL about how it turns out then do yourself a favor and pick this one up. The organization is very strange (there isn't any to speak of) and the writing style is very direct. The result is a no-nonsense book that teaches you to cut the crap out of your writing.<br /><br />There are many, many valuable lessons contained in Strunk's short and useful guide but the best ones, for me, are the ones regarding comma usage and his favorite command, \\"Omit needless words.\\" During everything I've ever written since reading this book I've heard a disembodied voice telling me to remove words. I've noticed while editing other people's work that the piece can be improved dramatically by deleting all the words that say nothing.<br /><br />It's a quick read but a necessary one for anyone doing any kind of writing.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|I did like Quantum Solace but this is a movie that seems to have very little to do with the fantasy James Bond.  Clearly the attempt has been to make 007 more real but the more real he becomes the less like James Bond  he is.  Imagine making a Batman Movie starring Bruce Wayne (James Bond) but eliminating Alfred (Moneypenny).  Getting rid of all of the Bat Gadgets (no Q gadgets) and eliminating all of the super villains like the Joker (no Goldfinger or Dr No).  Keeping Commissioner Gordon but placing him in a common role (M is part of the action).  Then taking all of those pneumatic women that characterize Bond films and making them into --- a babe.  This is what they have done to Bond - interesting and fun film but is it James Bond?<br /><br />This movie starts out with a car chase that has no beginning but seems to take forever.  The purpose of this chase seems to be to bring the culprit to M for questioning.  This merely becomes an attempted assassination of M , which results in a foot chase that also takes forever and right in the middle of the Sienna horse race.  This setting doesn't seem to have any relevance other than a great chance for the film crew to see this famous race.<br /><br />The bad guys here seem to represent some sort of a super secret organization that is fronting a nefarious business enterprise.  Of course they are thwarted but the super secret organization apparently marches on after Bond, the Agent Babe, and the bad guys totally destroy a luxury hotel built in the middle of nowhere.  How this hotel survives or why it is there is never clear.<br /><br />The film editing meets current standards which means that all action sequences have so many jump cuts that you can't follow the action and the close-ups are so close that you can see the weave of the clothes but not what they are wearing or doing.  Of course there is the requisite plethora of car crashes, car chases, property destruction, and killing innocent (nameless and unseen) people to satisfy contemporary tastes.  The plot is the classic plot where Snidely Whiiplash threatens Tess Trueheart and ties her to the railroad tracks.  But Dudley Doright arrives in the nick of time and rescues her - that sort of sums up the plot of Quantum Solace.  I do admit they didn't include the villain twirling his moustache and shouting \\"Curses Foiled Again\\" as he fades into the night.<br /><br />This is a fun film but just your run-of-the-mill action film that happens to have a hero named James Bond.  It's fun but not a 007 film.astes.  The plot is the classic plot where Snidely Whiiplash threatens Tess Trueheart and ties her to the railroad tracks.

0071359168|5.0|This book was given to me by my dad, the king of business books and the fastest, most prolific reader I know. This guy blows through almost 1,000 pages a month on top of all the magazines, newspapers, and online sources he devours. Though our reading tastes aren't completely aligned, when he recommends a book, I typically read it (or at least add it to The List in earnest).<br /><br />This is the kind of book I don't read. Though I find the advertising industry slightly interesting, I mostly hate it and wish it would go away (despite having a hand in it). This book, however, really cuts through the crap and explains positioning and branding in a way I've never heard before. In terms of marketing and branding, I pretty much live by the concepts in this book. Oh, and it's about 30 years old. That's how good this book is.<br /><br />The  book shows you what successful companies have done to become that way and what other successful companies have done to screw it all up. With tons of examples and a very straight-forward writing style, this book will explain why certain products win and why others fail.<br /><br />I read this book quickly and moved onto others by the same authors. They really know their stuff.
0446402389|5.0|I bought Child 44 based on a review I read in Publishers' Weekly, which was chancy for me because PW and I don't often agree on what's good and what isn't.  But Child 44 is brilliant.  We don't simply read about the Soviet Union at the end of Stalin's reign; we become IMMERSED in life in late-Stalinist USSR.  We feel not only the cold; we feel the constant uncertainty of life; the reality that at any given moment we may be denounced to the powers be by anyone, including our children, and will be sent to one of the prison camps in Siberia where the life expectancy is very, very short.  The author's decision to create a main character who works for the agency that is the forerunner of the KGB, to make that character a major player in that agency, and to make him a sympathetic character despite all this was a gutsy, chancy decision, but it works brilliantly.      To discuss the plot in much of any detail would ruin the book for most readers; I will say that I'm old enough to be rather jaded when it comes to suspense/thriller/mystery/horror genres, and very little surprises me -- but this book blew me away.  I really thought I had it all \\"figured out\\", and as it turned out, I was wrong, wrong, wrong.  The ending is stunning, horrifying, and completely unpredictable, but it ties all the different threads of the book together in one shocking moment of frightening realization, and another moment of decision that no matter what the main character does to attempt to resolve the situation, he will be wrong, no matter what that decision is.    Dostoevsky would have loved this, as would Solzhenitsyn and Pasternak, and the novel is of such complexity and drama, as well as unexpected twists, that it will likely be ranked, if not with these Russian literary giants, with important contemporary books about the Soviet Union.  I honestly didn't want the book to end and read it straight through.      The writing is good, the author's conceit works, the history is accurate, and we feelthe emotions of ALL the characters, not just the protagonist.  So we have a good book, a good writer, good writing and accurate history, all mingled with the horrors that only human beings can perpetrate, and one great eclat of realization, a stunning climax, and the weight of its aftermath.      I honestly can't think of a single reason why anyone should NOT read this book.  It's wonderful.  I hope the author can pull off the same quality and honesty and drama when his next book appears -- which I hope will be soon, but not TOO soon -- the pressure of absurd deadline dates all too often end up making a really good writer churn out novels that aren't worth the reader's time.  I really hope he's got a good agent, a good publisher, and a contract that will allow him to write another dazzling book.      So, in a word, READ CHILD 44!  And give kudos to Tom Rob Smith for a terrific debut novel that deserves literary awards, whether or not he gets them.
0446402389|4.0|Smith's title was recommended to me by a retired NCO, who like me,is fascinated by the excesses of totalitarian governments. He could not put the book down, he said.  Well, I could, having extended family whose ethnic base was murdered off by the millions in the Ukraine.  The cleansing of the population went on full bore,and we did not care,because they had no oil we could steal.  I took Mr. Smith's tome more personal than a mere work of fiction.  Then, there was my mother-in-law, who sent her relatives in Russia packages of army blankets and  coffee, as if the commies would not steal whatever they wished and as if our own Uncle Joe McCarthy would not add her to his list as somone else who should be marched off to an American Gulog.  But, as the story goes, Leo relentlessly pursed a hideous serial killer of children the state denied existed.  And, I will not even mention the fantastic coincidence in the final chapters, or the killer's \\"motivation.\\"  And, then, the book ends happily ever after...  Incredible!!!  Now, as an allegory, suppose a  country suspended its citizens' constitutional rights with some chuckled faced law such as the Patriot Act.  Suppose the public is disarmed.  Suppose education is taken over by No Child Left Behind nincompoops. Then, how much different will our position be than that of Leo's?

B000EBD9TY|4.0|\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" 11/20/08    By: Kevin Green    \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" was a brilliant depiction of a marital angst triumphing over sibling affection. Although Blanches' (Vivien Leigh) performance was a bit too theatrical for the big screen it was still a performance well worth her academy award. Blanche's only tie to reality, Stella (Kim Hunter), broke away from her and hence allowed Blanche to fall deeper into insanity.     Marlon Brando displayed a very natural performance as Stanley befitting of an Oscar. Mitch (Karl Malden) provided a good opposite to Stanley as a well-mannered gentleman. Overall, \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is a deeply passionate film that expresses realistically the common emotional tribulations a person may go through some time or another.
0385512058|5.0|What makes Never Eat Alone different from other business books that focus on the art of networking is that Never Eat Alone includes tips and advice that are unique. I've read more than my fair share of business books, and I can say with all confidence that this one is worth the purchase. The author brings in a good deal of personal narrative and real-world examples that illustrate just how easy it is to meet people and connect. \\"Connect\\" is the operative word here, because so many other books look at meeting people as a means of getting ahead. This book goes so far as to suggest that we actually try to get to know and build relationships with others. Now if that isn't unique for a business book, I don't what is.
B00000APLB|5.0|That's the opening line from Mick on disc 2...and who exactly is \\"dancing on the piano\\" there, sir?<br /><br />Actually, EVERYONE in the band dances on this live outing...the whole band is in top form.<br /><br />I've always interpreted that as a garbled line that evokes very amusing imagery, especially when one considers the time and place that this concert took place...all that 70s glitter.  I can almost see Jagger prancing around in a top hat as I listen.<br /><br />This is the Stones in top form, with a little punk, a little funk, and a little glam...and it takes place after the release of the 'Black and Blue' album, so they have lots of variety to throw at the audience.<br /><br />They also mix it up a bit, such as the funky version of \\"Get Off My Cloud,\\" and the bluesy improv of \\"Little Red Rooster.\\"  Fun stuff.<br /><br />The only thing that could have topped this might have been a live recording from the Exile on Main St. tour, or perhaps an expanded version of Still Life, which doesn't exist as far as I know...but this will do.  Interestingly enough, I believe this is the only live concert album the Stones put out in the 70s.<br /><br />This full length concert is essential for Stones fans, and an excellent snapshot of the band on the heels of their peak and in the midst of a late 70s noodling into punk, funk, and disco...showing all the little whipper snappers out there who's REALLY boss.<br /><br />Get it, you won't be disappointed...it might actually exceed your expectations.  It did mine, big time.
B001GQACGO|4.0|I made sure to purchase this album deluxe so that I can listen to all of the tracks throughly. For her 3rd album she did alright. This album was not one that I would expect her to drop. I feel that Beyonce should have taken her time, and possibly concern herself with her new married life. beyonce is on top of the game, and no one can knock her out for the next year. However, the album has been in heavy rotation in my ears since the day it dropped.    Best tracks on I AM:  -HALO: Beautiful subtle song, that MAKES you place that Halo over that special someone. This is my ultimately favorite one. I cannot wait until she sings this live.  -DISAPPEAR: This song is sooo beautiful! Describes that every feeling that you feel for that special someone that is oh so close, but yet so far :(. Good one to play to serenade your loved one after a heated arguement! LOL  -SMASH INTO YOU: I don't know how this song made it onto my list, but the concept of this song was cute. Good thing she put it on the delux instead of putting it on the standard. I would have been pissed if i purchased the standard and heard this track on there {LOL}.  -SATELLITES: This song is another beautiful ballad. Her lyrics on this track is wicked! You can hear her vocal range on this track. I wonder what her thought process was when discussing this song before it was made into this beautiful song!!   **BONUS TRACK: SAVE THE HERO: this song is my second favorite song. It makes me think about Clare Bennett of Heroes!! LOL. This song is real! Thank God that I paid extra to hear this song!! The vocals on this is crazy!!  I love the backup singers on this track!!!!!     WORST songs on I Am:    -If I were a boy: *quiet* I don't know about you, but I rather hear her sing this song while she is performing on some show than to hear it on my ipod or radio. Who cares about boys?? LOL  -BROKEN-HEARTED GIRL: Never heard the track so cannot really comment on it. After 1 minute of listening to it, i immediately skipped thetrack and went to the next song which happens to be on the next one on the list.  -AVE MARIA: come on Bey, really?? This could have been on a soundtrack or sumthing!  -THAT'S WHY YOUR'RE BEAUTIFUL: another wreck, come on bey!    Now we can discuss SASHA FIERCE!    Best Songs on SASHA FIERCE:   -SINGLE LADIES {PUT A RING ON IT}: CLASSIC Bey! Get them gurl.. i am actually listening to this track right now!!!!  -DIVA: I ultimately love this song!!!!! I am truly the definition of this song!!! Get them bey!!! oh yea, and Jay-z definitly helped her with this song.. you know her rhyme game is weak!! LOLOL  -SWEET DREAMS: I downloaded this song during the Summer time and fell in love with this track! I would bump this song out of my car, and everyone did not believe me that it was Beyonce!! Well the proof is finally out..   She is truly the new Queen of Hip-Hop!! I love this song!  -HELLO: this track should have been on the 1st half of the album!! I don't know how the hell it got onto here!! LOL.. This song is another reason why beyonce is where she is at!! She has a strong choice with picking the songs that will rock you out of this world!!!    WORST tracks on SASHA FIERCE:  -RADIO: this is something that had to grow on me.. catchy little tune!!! U can tell that Jay probably helped her out with this song LOL.  -SCARED OF LONELY: This song made it through the skin of her teeth, other than that it's alright! LOL  -VIDEO PHONE: come on Bey!! this is soo bad  -EGO: Why???? this is the track on this side of the album that convinced me that someone on the knowles Camp pushed her to come out with this poppy album!!   -WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME {BONUS TRACK}: i think this is a song on that new upcomiong song that she is coming out in!! LOL.. forreal. This song probably was a song that Etta James would have been singing. you know how Beyonce was all going full Gusto on the Dreamgirls coattail, well here is her other time to shine!!!    See you on tour Bey!
0743437497|4.0|THE SHINING is an excellent read, and had the potential to be better than it is, but King pulled his punches on every occasion when the story had an opportunity to go from great to sublime. King's ambivalence about the characters dilutes their energy. That is, Jack's congenital alcoholism and identification with his father should have been collateral to a Faustian pact with the Devil. You know, trade Danny for fame and fortune as a writer, and use the booze and pathology to make the kid get with the program.<br /><br />This would have set up an internal Armegeddon in Jack, where his good battles his evil for the boy.

B001GQACGO|1.0|Beyonce obviously has a problem selecting and writing good songs. This has been evident on all her solo releases and 'I am Sasha Fierce\\" proves the point eloquently. As with 'B'Day' and 'Dangerously In Love' it was necessary to separate the wheat from the chaff but this new effort is all chaff.    The title track was 'stolen' and an out of court settlement resolved the issue.  Still, it must have been a shocker for a young unsigned singer to hear her song blasting out over the radio sung by the biggest and most successful pop star of the day. Another song on this 'double CD' is also reputed to be 'stolen'.    Most of the great soul singers know a good song when they hear it. Not so with Beyonce.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I will keep this short. There have been times throughout the entire history of Doctor Who, when an episode will be emotionally charged, whether through the life of the character, or the Doctor. While they may be far and few between at times,  in this season they come in spades. There is the infernal pleading of Donna for the Doctor to save just one life from the destruction of Pompeii, the incredible heartbreak that her grandfather seems to wear on his face like a death mask, as if he really knows what had happened before the end of Turn Left (even though no one else does), when everything reverses course, and when the Doctor's daughter is shot and apparently killed. Then of course, one of the deepest cuts comes from the Library, where we meet an apparent highly emotional connection from the Doctor's future in the form of Riversong. Finally, at Journeys End, it appears all is lost, only to go through the vacuum of space time and come out the other end a little dustier, but still just as confounding as ever. Thus continues the enigma that is the Doctor. In addition, the thing from last season that really hit me was when the Doctor had to decide to come out of his professor protective persona and he was torn apart by it. It is hard sometimes to remember episodes from the older series when it was so emotional, we all know it is film and face, but there is some magic in all the mystery that just touches some of us in that special place inside that says, \\"what if we could travel thus?\\".
B001C48EFQ|1.0|When the director of a movie disses his own creation as it's released, you know that you're in for something spectacular. Spectacularly ghastly.<br /><br />Alas, such is the case with Mathieu Kassovitz's \\"Babylon A.D.\\" You can see why the director denounced his own work -- the end result is an incoherently chaotic thriller that comes across as the malformed, mildly psychotic love child of \\"Children of Men\\" and \\"Blade Runner.\\" There are some really bad movies out there, but \\"Babylon A.D.\\"'s incoherence puts it in a place of honor.<br /><br />A Russian mobster (Gerard Depardieu) hires a thuggish mercenary with the bizarre name of Toorop (Vin Diesel) to do a simple task -- transport a girl named Aurora (Melanie Thierry) and her guardian Noelite nun (Michelle Yeoh) to New York. But it soon becomes obvious that Aurora is no ordinary charge -- she seems to have precognition and inherent knowledge that a sheltered girl could never have, such as how to operate a submarine. No, I am not making this up.<br /><br />But it soon becomes obvious to Toorop that more is going on here than it appears -- apparently a malign High Priestess (Charlotte Rampling) is aiming to create a genetically-engineered messiah, which Aurora is now pregnant with (she's a virgin, by the way). Now Toorop -- whose cold, dark, selfish heart has been touched by Aurora -- must try to keep her safe from those who would use her...<br /><br />The movie may be called \\"Babylon A.D.,\\" but a better title would be \\"Babble-on Addled.\\" Apparently Kassovitz's original creation was thoroughly sliced'n'diced in the editing room, and seemingly random parts were stitched back together. Therefore, this Frankenstein's monster is graced with more violence than plot, and manages to be both painfully simplistic and incomprehensible.<br /><br />Admittedly, I doubt that it would have been worth much anyway -- the absurd religious criticism is handled with the subtlety of a sledgehammer in the eye (Virgin birth? \\"Noelite\\"?), and the dirty dystopia reeks of better, more unique movies that have come before.<br /><br />But the choppy reediting makes it phenomenally awful -- about half the plot seems to have been whittled away. Presumably the plot was pared down to make room for the action sequences, which are filmed in a blurry, eyeball-jarring manner. Some of them -- like the snowmobile chase -- are outright ridiculous. Pair that with some truly excruciating dialogue (\\"Cross me and you'll have no place to hide anymore, Toorop.\\" \\"It goes both ways, Gorsky\\"), and you're guaranteed to have a headache.<br /><br />And near the end, the plot goes utterly downhill -- major developments spring up out of nowhere with only the barest shreds of foreshadowing, before spiraling down to a ghastly out-of-nowhere ending. It's as if someone slapped together two radically different versions of the same story, and expected the result to make sense.<br /><br />Vin Diesel is playing basically the same character he always plays -- a thuggish, violent sort who Lives By His Own Rules and growls threateningly at everyone. Diesel is a pretty bad actor, but even a brilliant one would be hard-pressed to handle this dreck -- particularly since, late in the movie, we suddenly find out that he's got a Special Connection to Aurora.<br /><br />Of course, Aurora is an even bigger waste -- she's super-smart, super-talented, super-pure, and bleats about sensing death when she isn't kicking butt with yet more magic abilities. Absolutely zero sense. Michelle Yeoh, Charlotte Rampling and Gerard Depardieu are all utterly wasted here, and it's almost embarrassing to see such good actors getting such a raw deal.<br /><br />\\"Babylon A.D.\\" is a spectacularly wretched piece of work, with a disastrously messy plot and random violence.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|I really have enjoyed the rebirth of the James Bond series with Daniel Craig as our least Bond hero. The ones prior to Craig's Bond were becoming gimmicky and even silly; the quality had noticeably slipped.<br /><br />This movie is action packed and at times, violent; there is very little down time what with all the chases and the beautiful people (well mostly women) vying for the their own personal interests.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this movie was that some of the chase/action scenes were very choppy; they were forever quickly changing cameras and camera angles, almost giving the viewer as sense of vertigo with their rapid rotations and gyrations.<br /><br />Conclusion: An action packed James Bond sequel, however not quite as good as Casino Royale. 4 Stars
B000Z1LOBI|4.0|The only reason I do not give this album five stars is because every track on this album is not great, just most of them.  I recommend this album to the listener that likes death metal vocals but thinks Cannibal Corpse is too over-the-top. If you have never listened to death metal, this is a great place to start. Also, if you are not fond of lengthy guitar solos or would like to hear some moderate paced metal without excessive guitar solos for a change, this album is for you. I think 'Demonic Refusal' is the best song off of this album. Gene \\"The Atomic Clock\\" Hoglan, as usual, delivers drum parts that both display his virtuosity and fit in with the rest of the band.

B000EBD9TY|4.0|Elia Kazan's adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire is one to be reconed with. With the cast of superstars, such as Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh, he was able to show the constraints of raw human emotion at both ends of the primitive and cultural ends. Stanley's stone age actions towards and \\"ownership\\" qualities towards Stella is a pure contradicting parallel to the cultural qualities of Blanch. These two main characters battle throughout the movie, and each think they know just what the other is, either the caveman or the Nile queen. Although the movie is in black and white, you cannot deny the significance of the performances, or how it was directed so perfectly. I believe this movie will stay a classic for decades to come.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Granted some reviewers have created a de facto plot line by arbitrarily deciding that some parts are reality, some dream & some symbolism, etc. but they ignore large parts that can't be fitted into their story line. It's important to note the film started out to be a TV series, its seems a reasonable assumption the movie was cobbled together out of scenes that were originally intended to be used in separate episodes with a different plot. I guess Lynch thought every scene was so precious he had to use them in regardless. The movie could have been cut down by 30-45 minutes and not lost a thing.      Sadly rewatching  the movie didn't clear up a thing, I only saw more problems the second time. Can someone explain -    Who the laughing man is, what does he have and why is it worth killing for?    Who are the Mobster types that are trying to tell Adam who to cast as the lead?    Why is he living in a flop house, why his money cut off, who is looking for him.    Who is the huge guy that goes to Adam's house, why does his wife react like a psycho?    What's with the old lady prophetess of doom?    Who is the 3rd girl seen leaving when Betty and Rita are breaking in and I assume the one who comes back for her stuff?    Why is her ash tray she takes still there in the next scene    Why does Rita decide to go blond then is back to brunette in later scenes?    Who is the middle age red head that wanders in & out for a few minutes?    Whats with the Betty / Diane name swap.    The movie does have some interesting scenes as they stand alone, but trying to fit them into a whole is probally a waste of time. Analyzing movies like this have become the modern equivalent of debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. But it doesn't make for good movies or the director a genius. Genius is making a well crafted movie with a compeling story, not 150 minutes that leave you with that \\"Huh\\" feeling.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|Oh my gosh, could this movie be any cuter?  I don't mean that in a sickeningly sweet way.  This movie is just a good story about women trying to make it on their own after the war in London.  The Fossil sisters were all foundlings of a collector of all things paleontology.  They grew up in a big old grand London house alongside trilobites and T Rex until those treasures had to go to make room for the growing girls.<br /><br />Petrova wants to be like Amy Johnson when she grows up.  I think Amy Johnson must've been the British Amelia Earhart.  Posy was found with only a pair of pink toe shoes when she was a baby, her mother having been a young ballerina who had neither resources nor time to care for her child.  And the oldest is a stage natural.  These three girls live a life filled with love and possibility, if not one of materialism.  Still, their needs are always met and the girls receive great educations and theatre training.  IN fact, everything in this movie seems to be blessed and appointed by Providence.  Every time they have a need, it's magically filled by strangers literally at the door.  And in the end, everyone has a happy ending.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Ballet Shoes.
B001ECQ6YW|4.0|\\"Kung Fu Panda\\" has a pretty good kick. You're given the standard boiler-plate unlikely hero makes good plot, with Jack Black as Po the Panda and Dustin Hoffman as his not-so-willing coach, Master Shifu. The \\"Furious Five\\" are all super-jocks that think this oafish bear doesn't belong in their rarefied air, but Po eventually wins them over with pluck, wit and courage. The evil villain Tai Lung (voiced superbly by [[ASIN:B001FA1OTU Deadwood's Ian MacShane]]) comes back to get revenge on past indiscretions; can Po save his beloved valley and prove that he was correctly chosen the Dragon Warrior?<br /><br />That's the plot in a nutshell, and if you think you've seen this a million times before, you're right. Both live action ([[ASIN:0800177258 A League of Their Own]]) and animation ([[ASIN:B000UVKGQC The Shrek Trilogy]]) have covered this ground, and \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" walks the same turf like it was rice-paper. What sets it apart are the clever nods to old-school Kung-Fu flicks (along with having Jackie Chan add his voice skills) and its ability to resist over-indulgence in easy humor. Only once or twice does the film resort to butt or burp/fart jokes.<br /><br />That helps hold the film's IQ higher than much of \\"Family Film\\" content, so I feel safe bumping \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" to a fourth star. The dialog is also clever and snappy, which leaves Jack Black plenty of room to riff and vocally mug. (Something the clumsy [[ASIN:B00005JNQS Robots]] couldn't overcome, even with Robin Williams leading the voice cast.) The animation is super, giving each character his or her own special trait; I especially loved the burning eyes of Tigress. The battle scenes were exciting, too. With such a positive message in the midst of it all, \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" was second only to [[ASIN:B0013FSL3E Wall-E]] as the summer's best animated movie.
0385312083|5.0|Somewhere in the first chapter (or maybe the second, if you are convinced that the first chapter is a foreword), it dawns on you: this is not normal. The main character is not dynamic. There is no real, driving conflict. There is no escalation, nor any other conventional literary mechanism used to move the story. That would probably be the best word to describe Vonnegut: anticonventional.    What follows is a masterful tale the likes of which we may never see again. The sublime tones combine with a graceful, immersive imagery and characters that are bare and gaunt while also full of fervor. The themes are beautiful and horrible to watch, but Billy Pilgrim's journey is one you won't be able to avoid. It'll call to you whenever this book is not in your hands. At any given moment, you'll find yourself murmuring to no one in particular, \\"So it goes.\\"    I am not sure how this novel is assigned to high school literature classes, because the book is so subtle and layered: I would think that teaching this book to teenagers would be like describing Newton's theories to a family of Dachshunds. I guess that's why they (high school English teachers, not the dogs) descend to the level of Ethan Frome, or other such toys, to pass the time. Purely put, Vonngeut doesn't deserve to be put on your bookcase; the proximity to so many inferior works might lead someone to believe that Slaughterhouse-Five is comparable. I'd suggest framing the book and mounting it on your dining room wall, but that might prevent you from reading it again. Which you should. Immediately.
0385340990|3.0|I am surprised at how well-received this book is.  I don't think it's five star worthy, but it's not a complete waste of time. I think this book would be universally appealing, however, because it's a classy, charming read, but it's nothing mind-blowing.  It's written as a collection of correspondence between the characters and I think that's appealing to the reader as it seems to let the reader \\"in\\" on their lives.  While I certainly think this book could be recommended to ANY reader (young or old), I found the writing a little stuffy.  It's a basic format, but it's written pleasantly and harmlessly well.  It's slightly romantic and a little sassy, not too heavy but not shallow either.  I found that while the characters are charming, they aren't nouveau.  They're a basic stereotype on what kind of people you would expect to find living in a small remote area.  Overall, I found the story cute, but unsurprising and unimaginative.
0316017922|1.0|For males traveling by air, this is a nice ego boosting read. For females traveling by air, do not waste your money on this machismo, female deficit, piece of crap. I did waste my time and money, bought it on the way back from a trip thinking I might learn a secret or two about success. There are none. Total chest pounding praises on how to be a very rich male. Mother Theresa, Princess Diana, Oprah Winfrey, JK Rowling are several women I wish had been included in this stupid book. I do not recommend it.
0316017922|5.0|I have to admit I am a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's. I was impressed by his previous book, Blink, although I was was slightly disappointed towards the end of that book as I felt he was rehashing earlier examples and issues to make the book a little thicker than it otherwise would have been.    Outliers has no such problem. In fact, I would have been more than happy if he had been able to write another hundred pages. I devoured Outliers, and would happily recommend it to my family, friends, and enyone else who has any interest in anything remotely related to people. In fact, I will be giving a copy to my father for Christmas.    Citing many references, he explains how many people who seem to be successful are so not because they are purely talented, but because of a series of events which occur beyond their control, which those people with appropriate talent, drive and ambition, are able to take advantage of. Many such people happen to live in the right location, were born in the right year, go to the right school, or even born to parents of certain skin colour. They also have a lot of help and support from many people.    And counter intuitively, many of those who seem to be talented and high achievers, are simply those who have had the opportunity to achieve ten thousand hours of practice. If you are not as talented, it is not necessarily because you lack the talent, it is because you didnt put in the time, literally. The pianist example is very revealing.    As a non Caucasian, I connected with this book in several other ways.    I felt proud when he explained why Asians seem to be so good at Mathematics and such hard workers.     I could understand and relate to his last chapter on the influence of skin colour. A Caucasian would not have been able to have such an insight. And yet it is written in the way the rest of the book is written, explaining clearly, without venom, and without political correctness, how the attitudes and actions of those in the past allowed certain things to happen in the future, which, in turn, lead to a successful individual.    This is a fine book. It is mind opening, with lots of details, yet is easy to read.     I most heartily recommend it.

B000YD7S2Q|4.0|The three remarkable performances here are by Ekkehard Wlaschiha (who really brings Telramund to life, even makes you feel sorry for the stupid rock-head; also he displays flawless high-register technique and comfortable mastery of one of the most difficult roles in opera), Gabrielle Schnaut (her Ortrud is fearsome, especially when she challenges Elsa at the end of Act II, watching this is like being attacked by a moulting ostrich) and beautiful Eike-Wilm Schulte, relaxed but not soft or whiney as the Herrufer; whose personality he makes enthusiastic but dignified and modest, like a perfect broadcast reporter.  Also the choruses are fantastic.<br /><br />The other singers are adequate (although Paul Frey and Manfred Schenk are both way too boring), and the staging and costumes are terrific, with just the right balance of tradition and fantasy.  I especially enjoy the slow-mo sword fight in Act I.  And having Ortrud run into the river and turn her back to the audience for her prayer to the displaced gods in Act II is a nice touch.
1416562605|5.0|Adiga's \\"White Tiger\\" is compelling and extremely well-written.  For some reason, I had a hard time getting involved at first, but the quality of the prose eventually pulled me in.  I blame the initial hurdle on myself rather than on Adiga, however, as this isn't normally the type of book I read.  In fact, I bumped my initial four-star review up to five, because I was won over despite my own reluctance.  Looking back, this is almost entirely because the writing itself drew me in, and captivated me despite my own initial disinterest in the topic.  No wonder it won a Booker :-)<br /><br />The bittersweet transition from dark to light, which is the escape of familial and cultural oppression into the grip of class oppression is powerful and well portrayed.  The protagonist and grows as he transitions from villager to the driver of a powerful boss, and then again as he discovers corruption and disgrace in his new position.  For a first time author, this is exceptional.  I'm deliberately keeping this review short, because I don't want to give away too many of the nuances of the story by talking about them here: suffice it to say that White Tiger is enjoyable as both a character study, a cultural study, and as a novel - especially towards the end when (again, not to give anything away) things turn a bit darker, and more exciting.

B001GQO50I|1.0|The lineage of this recording is questionable, and it shows. Many of the tracks are hissy, and contain artifacts that are present in bootlegs of this material that have been circulating for years. It's also a shame that the guy who made (and owns) the master recording, Mr. Peter Abram, is not credited. Why would the Doors management bury their head(s) on these issues and release this in its present form?
0743290119|5.0|One of the greatest and best written chick lit books I have ever read. Funny, witty and still full of sensitivity, it follows Leigh, Emmy and Adriana who despite having seemingly perfect relationships, all struggle against what they should or shouldn't be doing and reconciling what looks good to society and what feels right for them. Great read, highly recommended.

B001ESYAJY|2.0|There always seem to be complaints on David Arnold's Bond scores that he doesn't use the Bond theme enough, and I have to agree.  This film seemed to get away from the elements that make Bond what he is, and by not utilizing his theme songs helped take away from that.  I know having it used over and over gets repetitive, but he could have incorporated it in different ways by building on it with themes that would have supported the character.  His score for \\"Casino Royale\\" didn't use the score but he masterfully set it up for the payoff at the end.  Here, I felt there were no traces of Bond.  For an example of how to do it right listen to John William's scores for the first three Indiana Jones movies.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|This album just grew on me the more I heard it.<br /><br />Listening to more recent Camel CDs is like taking a journey: you encounter different landscapes along the way, each with their own merits and while not all the music encountered is great, there are moments of sheer brilliance and bliss that it makes it all worthwhile.  As always, the guitar playing of Andy Latimer is excellent and the final cut \\"For Today\\" makes this CD, in my opinion, well worth buying for this alone.  To hear the sound of the last extended guitar solo is just a treat and brings back memories of earlier guitar songs such as \\"Ice\\".  Another standout track with shimmering musical passages is \\"A Boy's Life\\" - again, you just enter into the song, let it lead you where it chooses and enjoy the journey.<br /><br />Just as prior Camel CDs such as Rajaz and Harbour of Tears had their own distinct flavor and influence (Middle Eastern and Irish respectively), this one has a decidedly English folky sound to it.  A refreshing cariation on the Camel sound.<br /><br />Compliments are also in order for Mr. Latimer for his vocal work which is particularly strong and passionate on several of these cuts.<br /><br />If you enjoy music that rewards the listener, rather than just tries to please on first hearing, and if you appreciate tasteful guitar work, I would highly recommend this CD.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell's \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\" generated thousands of dinner-party conversations.  This book will continue the string.     His subject is success and how it is attained.  Not routine success, but \\"outlying\\"--exceptional--success.    Gladwell is a forthright scavenger of others' ideas and research.  His test for appropriation is, \\"No kidding!  I never would have thought of that!\\"  His special skill is turning ideas into melodrama. So this book, like his earlier ones, is a collection of stories, each a parable.  He is a terrific storyteller.    Where, when, and to whom you were born are decisive, right?  Well, yes, but not always in the obvious ways. Joe Flom, for example, born to poor Jewish garment-makers in New York City  in 1930.  His entrepreneur parents taught him how to fend for himself. His birth date fell in a demographic trough, so  he got easy admission to student-short schools. Being Jewish kept him out of white-shoe Wall Street law firms. So he and three others set up their own firm and took the work that \\"gentlemanly\\" lawyers wouldn't do, litigation and corporate takeovers. The 1970s boom in these fields made Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom the premier firm in the country in takeover practice. LACK of privileged birth can be an advantage    Some of Gladwell's stuff is old hat.  For example, intelligence matters up to a point--about a 120 IQ.  Above that, there is little correlation between intelligence and success. The decisive factors are found in people skills, or what he calls \\"practical intelligence\\".      Some of  his stuff is head-snapping.  Why did Korean Air have seventeen times more crashes per million miles than United?  The reason is cultural.  He explains brilliantly, with a saga of air crashes and their causes that you can't put down.      Some of his stuff is whimsical.  One little-known reason for The Beatles' success was a grueling pre-fame soujourn in Hamburg, where they played eight- and ten-hour sets in strip clubs,seven nights a week for a year and a half, while their old pals in Liverpool were playing one- and two-hours sets a couple of nights a week.  McCartney and Lennon were gifted, no question, but without this intensive skill-sharpening, the band might have been just another bunch of Liverpool hacks.  Genius requires 10,000 hours of practice.    It is a mistake to suppose that this is just another simple-minded attack on \\"privilege\\".  Talent and hard work are necessary to success, Gladwell repeatedly reminds us.  But outlying success requires more.  It \\"is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky....\\"    The book is more diverting than profound. Nevertheless, you can read it in a single evening, and there are a lot worse diversions.

1590171993|5.0|For a short novel, Stoner has the feeling of a much longer work.  Perhaps part of this is the unremitting melancholy which Williams attaches to the main character, William Stoner.  A kind of Everyman who sets out on the course of higher education, Stoner never quite fits the bill of the academic super star he wants himself to be; yet he continues to struggle, to write a book, to be a better teacher, to be closer to his wife and daughter.  In the end, Williams' great accomplishment in this novel is his unflinching ability to show all sides of his characters.  In Stoner, even minor characters have a rounded feel.  And Stoner, the character, through all his struggles, remains appealing.<br /><br />This work, a \\"typical\\" novel about college life, somehow never falls to the level of the banal or expected.  Williams' great achievement is to make the college a legitimate arena for the human experience to unfold without staleness.  Rather than showing a lack of experience on Williams behalf (read Augustus to see this man's great range) Williams illustrates in Stoner that ANY area of human life can be subject to scrupulous literary exploration, even one so over ploughed as the college campus.

B000NS45DW|5.0|I initially listened to the audiobook of \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" while commuting and fell in love with Bety Smith's writing style.  Both books paint a vivid picture of the lives of Irish immigrants in NYC at the beginning of the 20th Century.  I am of Irish descent and had not realized the extreme poverty, exploitation and discrimination the Irish people experienced after coming to America.  I was very touched by the audio book -- so much so that within a couple of months I checked this book out at the library to experience the book again and to read Betty's other book \\"Maggie Now.\\"  Both made me sad, but also proud of the characters as they pridefully fought through sometimes overwhelming circumstances.
0312360266|4.0|After being severely disappointed with the Twilight series, I was a bit skeptical of Marked.  However, being stuck in a waiting period while a book was coming in the mail and having nothing to read, I decided to give it a try.  It came highly recommended from a friend...but this was the same friend who ranted and raved about Twilight, so I wasn't really sure how much I could trust her recommendations.  The back-of-the-book synopsis of Marked seemed...eh...rather typical of teen vampire books.  The cover was certainly attractive but, as I've learned many times, one shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  So, with relatively low expectations, I started to read.      And was pleasantly surprised.      Marked had an interesting plot.  Nothing earth-shatteringly new, but not as unoriginal as some books out there.  I personally found the idea of vampyres being accepted in society to be intriguing.  In my previous experience with vampire novels (which, I must admit, isn't that much), the vampires are typically in hiding and aesthetically unrecognizable (save for the typical pale skin and whatnot).  To read about them being almost completely accepted in the world and, on top of that, being easy to recognize physically with their crescent moon and other tattoos was rather refreshing.  The concept of fledgling vampyres having to go through a risky change and attending an academy were also relatively new to me.  Again, not completely unique, but different enough.       However, with that being said, it did get a bit annoying that pretty much EVERY famous person who ever existed was once a vampyre.  Shakespeare was a vampyre, the Amazonian women were all vampyres, some of the most well known country singers were/are vampyres, everyone worth mentioning in history was a vampyre.  It just struck me as odd and kind of silly to make anyone who mattered a vampyre and anyone who either didn't matter or was frowned upon in the book (for example, Bram Stoker) was just a normal person (usually someone who thought negatively of the vampyres).  Perhaps the authors should have cut the number of famous vamps down a bit.      When it comes to characters, there are few complaints from me.  The main character, Zoey Redbird comes off as a bit annoying and superficial at first.  I mean, she has an almost relationship with the hottest (and stereotypically lacking in intelligence) football player, constantly puts down people (in her head) for how they look, and bashes those from subcultures or groups that are a bit different.  But, as the book continued, Zoey became more likeable and realistic.  Honestly, I found it easy to relate to her because she was just the average teen, struggling to find her place in the world and overcoming the confusion of life.  She constantly worries about what other people think of her and becomes a bit self conscious about the fact that her mark is different and people stare at it...hey, that's how sixteen year olds are.  Zoey reminded me of the typical sixteen-year-old trying to gain independence and accept that she (like everyone) is different and unique.     That's not to say there weren't problems with the main character.  She really was just too powerful for a fledgling vampyre.  Some of it would have been believable...but not all.  It almost seemed as it every vamp trait Zoey exhibited was extraordinary for a first year fledgling and shouldn't be seen until the fledgling was in their third or even fourth year (for example, the blood lust and tattoos).  And, on top of that, she's possibly the only vampyre to ever feel all five elements.  And her mentor is the current high priestess.  And, on a social level, she was very easily accepted into the Daughters of Darkness, the most exclusive clique in the school.  Like with the number of famous vamps, Zoey's talents and positive traits could have been cut down a bit.     The other characters weren't that bad, either.  Sure, it was somewhat stereotypical to have the group of outcasts: the gay guy, the Okie to-a-tee roommate, an African American girl and another girl who thinks of themselves as twins, and one or two other typical outcasts.  Heath filled the role of typical dumb, drug doing, drinking, romantically eager, hot football player and K played the part of jealous ex-high school friend.  Erik was the Mr. Perfect of the book, the guy everyone wants to date, and the guy who, ultimately, only wants to date Zoey.  Aphrodite was the common school slut, stuck on herself and nasty to anyone who challenged her power.  Neferet was the mystical and powerful priestess and comforting motherly figure.  The various teachers were just that: teachers.  Zoey's grandmother was the typical, loving, accepting grandma.  And Zoey's parents were the usual closed minded individuals who care more for what the neighbours think of them than the fact that their daughter/step daughter may die.  Yet, despite the stereotypical-ness of the supporting characters, many of the characters still had personalities and quirks, traits that make the reader actually care about them.  There was at least some thought put into taking these individuals from the often cardboard role of supporting character and making them into real characters, breathing life into them, so to speak.       The romance was, well, somewhat typical for teen books.  Zoey is caught in an almost love triangle between Heath, her ex from her old school, and Erik, the hottest boy at her new school who has shown great interest in her.  I actually found this to be somewhat realistic, too, in that she's stuck between her new love and her old love, not really sure if she wants to move on and leave her old love behind, but not wanting to pass by an opportunity for someone possibly better.  Honestly, I felt that there was more chemistry between Zoey and Heath than there was between Zoey and Erik (even though, I'm sure, this is the intended relationship).  The romance, surprisingly enough, does not take centre stagein the book.  In fact, it's almost more like a subplot that isn't really explored in this novel.       Some people have made complaints about the sexual content, drug references, and drinking references in Marked.  My response to that is simply: real teens in real life do the stuff in this book and worse and, unfortunately, it's probably not going to change, so deal with it.  I didn't think it was that bad.  Again, it was keeping to typical teen-life and in real life, it happens.       The other major complaint that seems to be made about this book is its negative view on organized Christian religion and its encouragement of paganism.  This didn't really bother me, as I'm not religious in the slightest.  Organized religion often is, in fact, narrow minded and unaccepting of anything or anyone different.  I'm not trying to bash religion, but that's just how it is.  And I think that since it was told through Zoey's point of view, the reason for the negative view on Christianity was well grounded.  Think about it, her father died when she was young and her mother later remarried to a pastor (so to speak).  In the three years that passed since that remarriage, Zoey's stepfather basically took control of the family, molding the mother into what he wanted her to be (telling her she can only have friends that he approves of, that she can't wear makeup, she can't wear clothes she likes, etc) and distancing her from her children, all in the name of God (as he claims).  So, I found it to be understandable that Marked would hold the view on religion that it does, seeing that the religion her stepfather was a part of played a fairly big role in practically destroying her family life (and the mother she loved dearly).       As for the writing style, it often struck me as rather juvenile and too teen-ish.   Really, I don't think this mother-daughter team thing is working well in terms of the writing.  It felt as though PC Cast wrote the manuscript and then handed it off to Kristen to make it more \\"teen-like\\".  All the modern references were annoying and, as other reviewers have said, put an expiration date on the novel.  Unfortunately, in five or so years, the modern references will no longer be modern and the book will seem dated for the references.  Seriously, the modern references could have been cut out without hurting the story.  Also, some of Zoey's thoughts were rather immature.  For example, I don't know of any teenagers who say \\"poopie\\" or \\"boobies\\" (and then giggle at it).  It felt like the authors tried too hard to make it teen-ish and ended up overdoing it.  They do, however, know how to write suspense, especially when the climax of the book begins to be led up to and takes place.  The plot was pretty well thought out, even if the pacing was too fast...everything takes place in a couple of days.       All in all, Marked wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  In fact, I rather enjoyed it.  Not bad for a light read.  It's no Twilight (thank God), but I don't think it was trying to be.  Which brings me to my final point: stop giving this book low ratings because it isn't Twilight (as some have).  Yes, for whatever reason, Twilight has become the \\"top\\" teen vampire book and I'm sure this has something to do with all the teen vampire books that have recently emerged.  However, just because Twilight is the trendsetter for vampire themed books doesn't mean that every vampire teen book HAS to be JUST like Twilight.  If you want to read books exactly like Twilight, then please, for the love of God, just (re)read Twilight.  These other vampire books don't deserved to be bashed because they aren't exactly like Meyer's series.  In my humble opinion, Marked was better (story-wise, anyway...the writing is often questionable).  I recommend it for anyone looking for a light read or maybe even a change of pace from their normal books.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|Quantum of Solace is the 22nd James Bond film.  It is directed by Marc Forster ([[ASIN:B00005YU1M Monster's Ball]]).  It is the second film to star Daniel Craig as the iconic secret agent and it is a direct sequel to the other film Craig plays Bond in, [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale]].  For the record, I'm obviously recommending this but definitely see Casino Royale as well if you haven't.<br /><br />The idea that Quantum of Solace is reminiscent of, and perhaps even derivative of, the stylized action scenes in the [[ASIN:B001F12J0C Bourne film series]] is of course a double-edged sword in terms of being critical.  I've opted to forgive that because the film opens by smacking you right in the face with one of the greatest car chase scenes in recent years.  Film Critic David Edelstein was critical of this scene, and probably the overall action style for being hard to follow and he went on to recall classic car chase scenes like the one in William Friedkin's [[ASIN:B0006GANN2 The French Connection]].  I see his point but I liked having a hard time following the chaos, it seemed more real to me and I was sold very quickly.  I thought it was quite a way to start a movie.  Speaking of the classic chase in The French Connection, I thought of that as well, and to me that means even Edelstein knew he was watching something big and loud enough that the comparison is a fair one.  I certainly think it is.<br /><br />The rest of the cast includes Bond's nemesis Dominic Greene played by Mathieu Amalric, a member of a secret society that poses as an environmentalist.  He is both formidable and detestable.  Opposite Bond are always some delightful looking women with appropriate spy-craft nomenclature.  Here we get Camille Montes played by Olga Kurylenko and Strawberry Fields or Mrs. Fields played by Gemma Arterton.  Judi Dench returns as M, her sixth film in a row as the character.  Dench started in [[ASIN:B000M53GM2 GoldenEye]] but I don't remember her getting as much screen-time then as she does here in Quantum of Solace.  She does a great job with a character we get to know a little more about.<br /><br />I'm not a huge 007 fanatic.  I've seen most of them and I've enjoyed the ones I've seen for the most part.  However, because of that perhaps I hold less obligation to the 007 legacy, so I make no reservations in my assertion that between Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale, Daniel Craig is the best James Bond so far.

I was the only person that went along for the show and about 20 minutes into this film I began to squirm.      Sequels get a bad rap, but this was unnecessarily bad.  If you want to watch an Indiana Jones movie got and buy a copy of Raiders of the Lost Arc and sit back and enjoy it, this is not even close to being in the same class.  What you get instead is Harrison Ford trying his best to work with a bad script, a horrible plot in a movie that lacks suspense, joy, excitement or clarity.  Blanchett's horrible Russian accent immediately confirmed that nobody who made this movie gave a damn about its outcome - it was just a pay day.    That will teach him to buy movies without reading reviews first.  Hopefully you are smarter than he was!

B000YABYLA|5.0|I wanted to hate Juno so bad.  I suppose all of the trendy dialogue and often unnecessary indie credibility made me want to target this as among the most overrated films of 2007.  In retrospect I hate when I have preconceptions going into a film but at least here I can admit its impact.  Juno isn't overrated at all and although the dialogue is still hard to believe in flashes; the characters were compelling, enjoyable, and very easy to like.  It was a simple task to forgive the few flaws I expected to find.<br /><br />The film is directed by Jason Reitman ([[ASIN:B000H0MKOC Thank You for Smoking]]), the son of director Ivan Reitman ([[ASIN:B000060K4O Ghostbusters]]).  It is written by Diablo Cody, a known blogger who won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for Juno.  The film's cast is actually very deep for its modest budget of $7 million dollars.  The cast includes Ellen Page in the title role, Michael Cera as her quasi-boyfriend and father-to-be, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the would-be adoptive parents of Juno's daughter, and J.K. Simmons as Juno's father, among others.  It always surprises me when J.K. Simmons appears in a role as a nice guy after seeing him play an imprisoned Aryan gang leader for years on [[ASIN:B000G6BL42 Oz]] and the fiery J. Jonah Jameson in the [[ASIN:B000UR9T82 Spider-Man movies]].  He is always an outstanding supporting actor.<br /><br />Juno follows a young girl named Juno MacGuff (Page) who discovers she is pregnant.  The film looks the issue of abortion right in the face, for better or worse, seemingly indifferent to the views of either side, and eventually Juno decides she will have the child and put it up for adoption.  Mark and Vanessa Loring (Bateman and Garner) are a married thirty-something couple that want to adopt the child.  Juno's interactions with both Mark and Vanessa are engaging and surprisingly fresh.  The supporting characters are very strong and make the main characters even more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The strength of Juno's character seems to be one of the film's contentious points.  Everyone seems to agree that Page is amazing in the role, and she is, but the way the character is written was something I expected to tackle as a flaw.

Everyone seems to agree that Page is amazing in the role, and she is, but the way the character is written was something I expected to tackle as a flaw.

0061122416|5.0|Paulo Coelho weaves a masterpiece confronting the very basis of the way we live in society today. He tries to show that if you follow your, \\"Personal legend\\" which is what your deepest dream is, and what God has planed for you, you will achieve true happiness.   Paulo Coelho was born in Brazil. He has always been devoted to art of literature. He was once captured by paramilitaries because of his deep faith in freedom of speech. He started writing at age 27, and his first book was not much of a hit. When he wrote the first edition of the Alchemist it only sold 900 copies. He brought it to a different publishing company. It caught on like wildfire and sold more than any other Brazilian literature. Since then, he has continued to write books and has sold more then 65 million copies in 150 different countries in 60 different languages of his various novels.   Paulo Coelho does an amazing job of showing his perspective on how life should be lived. He writes a vivid story of a Shepard that gives up all he can to find a treasure. The Shepard is constantly challenged along the way and has to overcome these challenges. Coelho focus greatly on following your heart and omens from God in order to achieve your personal legend. Personally, as a high school student, I think that it is a good book, but can seem a little far-fetched, as far as the ideology goes, to some people. I think that it takes an intelligent individual to understand the book for what it truly is.   This book is written extremely well and is full of very insightful wisdom. I agree with him when he states \\"To realize one's destiny is a person's only obligation.\\" However, this can be quite hard to do in today's society. Overall a very good book.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|This is a departure from the initial three albums from Coldplay, and the songs often sounded disjointed and strange compared to those on Parachutes, X&Y and a Rush of Blood to the head.  Those albums are so great that the first time I played Viva is just didn't do it for me and I found myself longing for the album of old.      It took a while but it has grown on me, I am still not entirely sold however when I saw Coldplay in Kansas City I was belting out the songs with gusto.  Maybe its the nostalgia from a great show but Viva has got its hooks in.

B001AR4K8K|5.0|I can understand if the Newer generation of kids are not digging this movie.  I must say though that this is one of the best films of the 80's.  Personally, I think it's untouchable.  The lost boys: The tribe doesn't even come close to the greatness of the this one which is the original.  It's really hard to put into words though because I grew up in the 80's and this movie was strongly talked about at that time.  For people that grew up in the 80's and were old enough to get into the movie, this movie gives an unexplainable warmth that rushes over you.  The songs in the movie go extremely well with the movie.  Everything from the music to the actors were perfect, If I could somehow change one thing...I wouldn't even dare.      This movie just brings back so many awesome memories of that time in my life.  The 80's were really good for these horror flicks but this movie is a complete gem all on it's own.    Do not miss out on this movie, you will love it.
0800141660|5.0|I must start this review stating my biased approach. I love this time era and this story so of course I would like it. Here is what I will add that some people might find useful in deciding whether or not to purchase this.<br /><br />The story is believable and the characters are honest. You see the imperfections of the system as well as the optimism that kept them going. The sisters loose their father and are left with an emotional mother who is beside herself for the outcome of their situation and all that threatens her daughters - no dowry, no status, no husband to look after them, no future or hope. One sister goes the rational way and the other gets lost in romantic ideals. Both have faults and  it is through those wounds that they are bound together and become a family.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This film is cute. The story is fine, I think the whole \\"Evil Liberal Agenda\\" argument was more of a marketing ploy that was blown out of proportion by some.     For a film with no dialog save for \\"bleeps\\", \\"squibs\\", and \\"wall-e\\" through the firs two thirds of it, this anthropomorphic little robot is really engrossing and endearing. It's also one of the few films where a cockroach would be classified as cute.    I thing the CG is fantastic, there are points in the film where I actually forgot WALL-E was not a plastic model. The animation on EVE seems like it's from a different film and for my eyes almost 2D. I realize she is a newer robot and streamlined, still she looks 2D in a 3D world.

0316017922|3.0|This book, much like Gladwell's other books, is an enjoyable and educational read.  He presents many interesting research findings in a cogent and very readable manner, weaving a tale of the importance of chance in success.    One issue I take with this book, is that it suffers from survivorship bias; he examines very successful people, like Bill Gates, and decomposes their lives to see what helped get them there; time and again, showing the importance of chance in people's success.  This is not to say he is making the claim that chance is the sole reason for success, his book is replete with examples of the importance of practice & perseverance to attain success.  Nevertheless, he does not analyze a cross section of people who had similar 'chance events' yet did not become the next Bill Gates or Malcolm Gladwell.    In the case of Bill Gates, he attributes a great deal of his success to the fact that Bill Gates had access to computers (every abnormal at that time) through a series of chance events, none of which was really in Bill Gates' control. Gladwell postulates that had this not happened, Bill Gates probably wouldn't be the richest man alive today.     However, to really determine the role that his access to a computer played (and thereby eliminating survivorship bias), Gladwell would need to examine every other child who had access to a computer at that time; surely Bill Gates and Steve Jobs weren't the only ones who had access to a computer.  Of those kids that did have access to computers, how many attained similar wealth?  If it turns out that several thousand kids had access to computers, then this 'chance' might fairly be said to have contributed little to the success of Bill Gates.    This is not to say that the premise of this book isn't in part undeniably true, we are all where we are, due to chance events (or as Malcolm explains it: events that are beyond our control, due to familial, cultural or epochal reasons).    I recommend reading this book, asit is an engaging read, weaving together information from numerous disciplines; just be aware of the survivorship bias that exists throughout.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|This album will go down as my favorite of Sigur Ros. Regardless to the language barrier I feel like a child - innocent, carefree and happy, whenever I listen to this CD. Musically it is incredibly simple yet precise to musical genius. A must have for musical explorers.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|At first, I was not sure how to take this series- It was a darker, naughtier, grimmier Dr Who without the uplifting fun of David Tennant and his band-    Slightly disappointed at the opener, it was not until the 2nd or 3rd episode where I really started to appreciate, then love the characters and premise despite their naivte at times. After all, they ARE NOT the Doctor, they are humans who for the most part have had little to no exposure to aliens and their technology, and are basically winging it (well, despite Jack) with 21st Century know how- They don't have all the answers like the Doctor, but they carry on their mission to learn more and adapt.     It is a reflection of how the earth carries on WITHOUT the Doctor's presence and the learning curve associated with trying to deal with extra terrestrial incursions- really, did Mulder and Scully ever get this much exposure or effect when dealing with aliens? Seems like every time they got close to a close encounter, the plot did not allow for prolonged or even physical contact with their protagonists, and they were usually relegated to staring at the thing as it disappeared.     The interpretations that the characters are morally compromised, well, I am sure that everyone of us is so perfect that we can judge other's character.    A great series and only getting better, with competent acting, great stories, and the FX is on par with Dr Who (Suprise?).
0099429799|2.0|It sounded like a good book when I bought it, but didn't enjoy it.    It seems that most people really love this book, but I hated it.  I only give it two stars because various passages of the book were interesting.  I enjoyed those few pieces but as a whole I wanted to toss it in the trash.  The book seemed to drag on and on.    I was not able to care about any of the characters, I found them all self absorbed and immature.  I could neither really love or hate them, they seemed too fake to me.  Without the story invoking feeling I couldn't get into it.

B000H5AK1W|5.0|This book is one of the best novels of our time!  Carl Sagan was such an extraordinary human being!  I highly recommend this book to anyone! Especially if u have seen the movie, regardless whether u liked it or not.  The book is, of course, very different, and, of course, much better than the movie (although the movie is pretty good too). It seems there are very few books like this one who manage to talk about all the big and important issues of our human race.

031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn or New Dawn    BEWARE...CONTAINS SPOILERS.  Breaking Dawn, the fourth book in a series of novels by Stephanie Meyer, stands alone from the pack. You can't even compare it to the other three books because of the character development and depth of emotional interplay that focuses the attention of a more mature reader. Not that the other three weren't filled with emotion and lively characters, but this novel moves from the teenage world to that of an adult with responsibility.   The progression of the titles is a metaphor for this change. The first book, Twilight, involved Bella's life in the dark and moving to a town that lacks sunshine for seven months. New Moon signifies a new chapter in Bella's life as she continues her relationship with Edward. Eclipse concerns the sadness of Edwards's departure and the happiness upon his return. In Breaking Dawn, Bella moves from the teenage world of the previous books into the sunshine of marriage, a child and her metamorphosis into a vampire.   I absolutely loved this book, but I felt that there might have been a little too much going on for one story. There were two parts to Breaking Dawn. Part one was in Bella's perspective, like the other three books were. Part two was in Jacob's perspective, and then part three went back to Bella's viewpoint. I think Stephanie Meyer should have put part one and part two together for one book then put part three into a separate story. It would have made the book easier to follow and definitely would make her fans happy knowing that there was another book after Breaking Dawn.   When I read Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse I found the books to be predictable. For example, in Eclipse when Edward left I knew he would return. But Breaking Dawn was a whole other story. I actually couldn't figure out what was coming next. I wasn't even sure if it would have a happily-ever-after. I suspect what we are seeing in this novel is the real life experiences of the author which naturally aren'tpredictable. Perhaps it's the author who is maturing, not the novels.   After finishing the first three novels, I was left with a satisfying \\"WOW,\\" but with Breaking Dawn it was more of a \\"Whoa! What just happened?\\" I had to re-read a few passages to fully understand everything.   Breaking Dawn was a romantic, gripping and enjoyable read, filled with zippy one-liners and quirky anecdotes we've all come to adore, but one I had to put down often for reflection. As always, Meyer has left us satisfied, but instead of looking forward to a sequel, she's left us all hoping for a new series.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|FINALLY, HBO is must-see Pay-TV again!  As much as I love LITTLE BRITAIN USA and the under-appreciated FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS, it is TRUE BLOOD that is turning HBO right back around and giving SHOWTIME a reality check that the original HBO knows how to do a series right. I am totally hooked on TRUE BLOOD!  Knowing that it is going into a second season after my beloved PUSHING DAISIES just got cancelled, is something of a relief. Now my two favorite dramas on TV are: LOST and TRUE BLOOD!
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|Howard Hawkes can do it all. The screwball comedy was never better and alas never will be better. I suppose you could say this is a gimmick picture as they use a live leopard in a number of scenes. The Cary Grant brontosaurus has a small part as well.     Hepburn sees Cary the four-eyed prof and goes after the befuddled handsome man with everything a 1930's girl has. Madcap motor-mouth one liners rip away. Cary is embarrassed, disgraced, and horrified for ninety minutes till Hepburn cannot be denied. Amazing fast pace and editing for one of the finest comedies ever made; it can be watched again and again.

B001KO3FFW|4.0|I voted for Cook every week and was heavily anticipating this album. I wasnt disappointed for sure but I wasnt blown away. He does what he does best, a rock voice with a slight edging into emo. I suppose thats what he was known for on AI. I was wishing perhaps for a bit more creativity. Most songs on here could be exchanged easily on a Daughtry album which is not a bad thing per se', it just feels more corporate than artistic.
B00004RF97|5.0|The Great Depression, some things never change. The rich are evil and the poor are sainted. Tracy Lord, the unfortunate name of a recent adult film star, she is kind of a glorious snot ; she'll marry a rich piker to get even with her suave but drunken ex-husband, Cary Grant.     Grant is Cary Grant, but Stewart, a newcomer, holds his own as the young writer skittish about rich folks and women. His long-suffering girlfriend, charming, Ruth Hussey, stands by demurely.    A little dated, but clearly courting mores were more distinct and perhaps safer way back then. Wonderful film!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This CD is a must buy if your a Metallica fan.  I bought this like 3 weeks before it came out on amazon and had first day delivery, but just decided to review it now.  This CD is more like earlier albums in a way more than St. Anger, Load or Reload.  It features some great songs like All nightmare long, The day that never comes, my apocalypse, the unforgiven 3 and many others.  Just take my word for it.....this cd won't let you down.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I knew when I first saw him that he was destined for greatness.  I loved every song he did on Idol (especially his own arrangements), so I knew I had to have this CD before he did it.  I was even more suprised at how good it is.  A lot more than I ever expected.  He also wrote most of the songs.  The lyrics are so beautiful, he truly is a \\"Word Nerd\\".  A must have CD.  Something for everyone.
030014332X|5.0|I read this to my boys and we learned tons together. I have a degree in history, but was taught a great deal. The writing is warm and easy to follow. Gombrich includes his interpretation of events but is very respectful to all groups involved. I think it would be very helpful to all college history students to start with a course based on this book or one similar. It just puts all of human history into a concise linear perspective. Later courses would put meat on the skeleton. My education isolated periods from how they related to each other. This book will help you understand how in the world we got where we are today.
006088732X|5.0|THIS IS THE PERFECT BOOK TO READ ALL IN ONE SITTING.  BUT NOT RECOMENDED FOR CHILDREN.  THESE ARE PERFECT FOR TEENS.  MY FRIEND AND I LOVE THIS BOOK.  YOU SOULDN'T SAY IT IS SO INAPROPRAITE IT IS NOT MENT FOR LITTLE KIDS BUT MOST OF MY FRIEND SAY THIS IS SUCH A GOOD BOOK AND ITS TRUE.  I WOULD THINK IF ANY YOUNG CHILD WAS INTERESTED THEY COULD HAVE THEIR PARENTS READ IT. I BET YOU THEY WILL LOVE IT.  YOU JUST CAN'T GO AROUND TRASHING A GREAT BOOK.
031606792X|4.0|Whereas the previous books in this series focused on the very human and clumsy Bella and the vampire, Edward, this one is a book of Bella's transition into the vampire world. For me, this wasn't the best of the series, but a definite must read for fans. Some of the character conflicts were resolved a little too easily, but perhaps this was to make room for the story of the Volturi. Let's face it, Stephanie Meyer could have kept this series going for a long time, and in a way, I wish she had, rather than trying to resolve so much in one book. Parts of it seemed rushed towards a resolution, just so something else could happen. I thought there were way too many vampires introduced in this book and for me it was hard to keep up with who was who and what their history was. While there is a guide included at the end to help with this, it was still hard to follow. That said, I have totally enjoyed the series and this book as well.
0140067477|5.0|Simply put, this book is excellent.  It is simple and concise, and it keeps you reading.  I also think it does a great job giving you the basics of Taoist thought.
0375826726|5.0|wasnt expecting it to be so great!  so, i got the book just cause i hate not having finished a series i have started. it will irk me to no end. but oh my, what a surprise, the first chapter had me and for the rest of the week i read it eagerly. i was especially loving the morbid parts for some reason, especially that first chapter, it really hooked me.   ... shame on me, i had forgotten how much i had enjoyed eragon and eldest.  i am very pleased with 'brisingr'. paolini does not dissapoint.  i loved reading nasuadas and rorans storys, i was very surprised to see that the book did have more than eragons perspective, i dont recall if the other books did that or not?... and i enjoyed the snippets of a dragons view!  hmm, i do believe that harry potter 7 has somewhat wounded me. when i found out that roran had his own storys throughout the book 'brisingr' i pleaded with each of his storys 'please dont kill him. please dont kill him. NOT LIKE FRED, DONT DO IT PAOLINI!'    well, youll just have to read to find out if roran lives or not.   Oh, yes! probally like many of you, i watch 'the seeker' on sundays. and yes, it does remind of eragon very much, there are similarities. but im not nettled by it. their just influences. eragon is great and original in its own right.  and i enjoyed the authors note at the end. very endearing. and the dictionary was a bonus!  oh, and i thought eragon the movie was ok. no, i admit it, i liked it alot! but, yes, it left parts out that play out in the second and third book, but i believe they can still make the second movie...   i hope they do.   anyways, enjoy brisingr!
0439806119|3.0|Uglies:  This is a great book in a great series.  Someone told me that this book was not that great but I thought I would read it. I saw where my friend was coming from but this was not that bad of a book.  It kinda had a confusing begging but as it got deaper into the story it grew better and better.  I would recomend this book because there is just something about it that makes it great.  I have never liked sci-fi I could never finish a sci-fi book.  Not saying that their are not any great sci-fi books but this one is one that you just get hooked on.  The author at the end of each book leaves you craving more. This book is so intriging.  But this is a series you shouldn't give up on.  If you don't like the first book I am almost positive you will like the next books.  The books get less complicated as you move on.  If you do not like the book the book like I say nothin' ventured nothin' gainedd.  If you like series these books are probaly perfect.

0765316897|5.0|For the last 2 years Vin and Eland have been trying to stop the end of the world.  But how do you fight a force that lives to destroy everything and can hear every word you say?     With this book Sanderson has pulled off something rare among fantasy trilogies, a well thought-out and satisfying conclusion to his story.  This book gives you lots of answers, and unexpected changes for all the characters.  Some people rise and others fall and we find things out about this world that are dramatically different from what everyone believed were the true answers.    If you a looking for a well thought out, and well written fantasy series with characters you can like then pick up this series and you'll find yourself saying \\"ah hah!\\" and \\"that explains a lot!\\" all the way through this instalment of the series.
B00061QJZI|5.0|This flick pertains to it being 1975 in San Diego about a famous and successful anchorman Ron Burgundy(Will Ferrell) who works alongside his pals on the news-team such as fashion-oriented lead field reporter Brian Fantana(Paul Rudd), sportscaster Champion \\"Champ\\" Kind(Dave Koechner), mentally retarded chief meteorologist Brick Tamland(Steve Carrell), and female newsreporter from Asheville, North Carolina Veronica Corningstone(Christina Applegate)who has been forced to hire as Ron's co-anchor.<br /><br />I liked this movie so much, MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Christina Applegate was sexy as usual and better looking and the most talented I have ever seen her throughout her whole acting career and I think Christina Applegate did an astonishing performance in this movie as well, not to mention she was definetly eyecandy in this movie.<br /><br />I also enjoyed all the oldies songs they played from the 70's like \\"Use Me\\" by Bill Withers, \\"Who's That Lady\\" by The Isley Bros., etc., plus I enjoyed all the outtakes they showed us at the end of ANCHORMAN as well, which were quite a crack-up.<br /><br />This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had in 2003-2004 when George Bush, Jr. was still president and Senator John Kerry was running against Bush during this movies theatrical release in the Summer of 2004.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a funny movie with Christina Applegate or Will Farrell in it, I highly recommend ANCHORMAN to you.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I bought this CD last year and, in the busyness of the season, never really explored it till this afternoon when I brought my Christmas music back out again for the holidays.  What a beautiful gift it is.  There is a nice variety of styles, and the creative arrangements perfectly compliment Mr. Taylor's velvety voice.  What I especially appreciated was the reverence by which the sacred songs were performed, especially \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\".  It is my new favorite Christmas CD!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|It's November 20th. Why is it only November 20th?  The Dark Knight drops in a few weeks, but it's so far away. I would very much like to see this film for the third time in my own living space already.  Holy Gadzooks, this movie is awesome. I really am looking forward to seeing Heath Ledger's Joker again in all its disturbed maniacal glory.     Now, it only makes sense that I should watch my copy of Batman Begins again to tide me over until December 9th, but that's not going to do it.  Of course, that is a possibility I may just entertain considering I did that a few times before The Dark Knight's theatrical release.     What I really liked about The Dark Knight besides Ledger's Joker is how the movie went in several different directions all the while remaining to the main plot theme and its central focus.   We saw the development of Two-Face and the conflicts created from a domino effect that occurred through Batman, Alfred and Lucius Fox.  But I'm not here to analyze this fantastic movie, I just want to use this medium as a means to deal with the time between now and then.  You know - the certain satisfaction of having that movie in your hands at the store the day it's released. That one movie that augments your personal library in a way that makes it almost seem complete. I'm not talking to the people who arbitrarily purchase films and such, this is for the folks who only collect those films with high replay value. Films that you watch repeatedly just to catch subtle things you might have missed once before. The films that you take great pleasure in introducing to your friends and family. The films that create a world for you to explore and appreciate, a perfect escape from your reality for a couple of hours.   Damn, I wish it wasn't only November 20th.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|This was a solid action movie, but I expect more of my James Bond films.  This had<br />a number of the elements, the sinister plot, gunplay, mystery, and great set pieces<br />which invariably explode at the end.<br /><br />How did it go wrong?  I'll start with what I have not seen from Daniel Craig:<br />the wit and style of the gentlemanly spy that is Bond.  Oh Craig looks right, and<br />handles himself fine, but Bonds as a rule have sort of glided through the scene,<br />avoiding enemies with ingenuity rather than brute force.  They also have charm,<br />something which I have not seen from Craig.  Oh he looks good enough, but Bond charms<br />the ladies, he doesn't just show them abs.<br /><br />Some of this may not be on the actor.  Maybe the directors are to blame.<br /><br />Either way, it is a nonstop action ride, at the expense of understanding and plot.<br />Fun, but nothing unique or special, like I expect from 007.
0783231032|2.0|My first impression about this movie: too much overrated and hysterical. Check other parodies, like Dr. Strangelove which is shoter and much better than this.
B00019HOMC|5.0|If you don't \\"get\\" this movie, it's understandable.  If you simply \\"don't like it\\", you have no sense of humor.  Give up.<br /><br />Now...Where's that damned \\"Special Edition\\"??

B001GQACGO|5.0|First of all I want to say this album is much better then the last album B'day. This album is more complete. There are both emotional and quick songs. You feel peaceful and balance after u listen to this album! BDAY IS WAY TOO NOISY AND ANNOYING FOR ME. She definitely improve her taste    2nd of all, I want to compliment for her courage to jump out of her circle. Her songs are really very different compare to her last two albums. This evolution may not be other people's favourite but for me it is absolutely perfect! (I am) contain things which are more personal. This part is like her diary. She is going through the stories in her life. I like some of the songs like \\"If I were a boy, Halo, and Ave Maria.\\" There is one song which I want to recommend. The song is \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" Whenever I listen to this song, I will feel a sense of heat pierce through my body. Even though I am a guy, I can absolutely understand the feelings of a broken-hearted girl because a lot of my female friends has been tricked by a lot of guys. This song is definitely a best choice for girl who broke up with her BF.    The 2nd CD is one of the more energize and fast disc. It has a lot of fast tempo and funky songs but IN MY OPINION is not as good as (I AM...). Some of the good songs are(Sweet Dreams, Diva and Hello). One song I want to recommend is Radio. It is one of the best song is this album. This song includes a lot of disco and future elements. Which is quite interesting! Beyonce also express her vocal versatile in this song which is wonderful!     Last, I want to sae this album is really Beyonce' heart and soul. I can feel it. I can also feel that she is changing her taste every dae. Things that are once her favourite are no longer her favourite anymore. She is evolving evrydae and getting more mature which also affected her fans. Her fans are getting more mature toO. This is what every singers should learn from. Dont always stay in the same circle.:)
B00005N5S5|3.0|I think it's safe to say that you aren't watching an Arnold movie for the acting, right?  You want to see things blow up and people get shot, right?  Well, if that is what you are looking for than this is probably the best way to get that fix.  `The Terminator' is one of those cult films that every `guy' in America, and quite possibly all over the world, has seen and has loved.  I personally saw it for the first time about a month ago.<br /><br />What...a whirlwind.<br /><br />I was totally in the dark going in, so the fact that Arnold actually plays a bad guy was like a big \\"whoa\\" moment for me, but whatever, I'm in the minority and I accept that.<br /><br />The film takes place in the present (well, the 80's) but the real story is what happen in the future, the year 2029 to be exact.  The world is overrun by the machines.  These machines devise a plan to change the future by altering the past.  In other words; they send a robot to the present to kill off the mother of humanity's savior before she has a chance to birth him.  That woman is Sarah Connor.  In order to save humanity a man named Kyle Reese travels back in time to save Sarah from the Terminator.<br /><br />The film is riddled with bad dialog and bad acting, all except Linda Hamilton, who actually turns out a very respectable performance as the conflicted and confused Sarah.  Arnold is, well, Arnold and Michael Biehn is horrible as Kyle, but like I mentioned earlier, the acting is far from the point of the film.<br /><br />Some of the effects and CGI are a little weak, especially as the film draws to a close and the Terminator is reduced to his metallic shell, but the film is an 80's gem and so its technical flaws are forgiven.  Personally though, I couldn't help but draw comparisons to the vastly superior `Matrix' film, which carries a similar storyline yet executes it much better.  I know that a lot of devoted fans may hate me for saying that, but I'm just trying to be realistic here.<br /><br />This brings me to my point mentioned in my title.  Is this really a classic?  I mean, looking at the film for what it is, a sci-fi action film, and then looking at where we have come in terms of special effects, acting and direction, I can't see why one would want to watch this when so many other options are much better.  `The Matrix' for example is much smarter, much sleeker and constructed much better.  Sure, Reeves is not the greatest actor in the world, but `The Matrix' may be the one film where his breed of apathetic deliver is desired.  `The Terminator' just doesn't stack up to modern spins on the genre and so it baffles me that so many stick by its side.  Sure, sometimes we have a special fondness for the films we grow up with, but honestly, this is generic and decent at best, but there is much better to be found elsewhere.this really a classic?

B001FOPODS|5.0|This unique stop-motion version of the classical musical tale was justly awarded the Academy Award for best animated short in 2007.  With its detailed models and wonderful animation, this is truly an enchanting version of how the young Peter makes a name for himself by capturing a mean and hungry wolf. Prokofiev's classic score is handled in high style here and is a treat for the ear. There are also delightful characters throughout ranging of the balloon-riding bird to the sly cat.  The wolf is especially forbidding and adds a real sense of menace missing in some versions.  Many folks familiar with this classic will be caught off-guard by the surprise ending, which teaches a rather touching lesson.  For fans of the stop-motion technique, this is definitely a must-have flick!
B000J3EEBY|3.0|While I enjoy the music on the CD which I bought from amazon.com, I cannot seem to download it to my real player and play it on my computer as I can every other CD I buy. Also, I can only hear it by going to their website which came up as netscape which is no longer supported. I'm not sure if these people are just behind in technology or doing something weird to protect against piracy or what but probably I won't buy any more of this artist's work.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|This is a movie everyone who can should see.  It provides a step-by-step,film account of Gandhi's transformation from a dapper young lawyer to religious figure to international icon representing love, forgiveness, acceptance, sacrifice and spiritual leadership.  It is interesting throughout, deeply moving at many points and occasionally spiced with humor.  The movie reveals that in his role as a spiritual leader, Gandhi's influence transcended all the divisions and subdivisions of organized religion.      It is emotionally galvanizing to see Gandhi shot dead in live footage and traincar after traincar of people from all corners of the world descend on India for Gandhi's funeral.

0765316897|4.0|I really liked the first book of this series and enjoyed the second book almost as much. The third book may not be as good as the other two but it is still a very good fantasy book. This book only gets less than 5 stars because of the high standard set by the previous two books.    The reason I liked this book less is probably because it is the last book. We've already established the characters and setting so the book is less focused (probably a little to unfocused) on character development. Instead the book seeks to answer and expand upon the themes laid down in prior books. These themes include the validity of religious belief, various forms of government, and the conflict between ideal action and necessary action. Sanderson works very hard at clarifying his position on each.    Overall the final book is deep, well thought out, and has a great ending. This trilogy will not turn into some long, overdrawn 10 part series that kills itself. This is really the last book and the ending to it is satisfying. The ending ties up all the loose ends nicely and rewards the reader for sticking with the series.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Hollywood masterminds Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks created an unforgettable 10 part miniseries based on the story of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army. An extremely impressive, deeply engrossing, emotional and brutal look at combat during World War II and Easy Company following in their footsteps from boot camp till the end of the war. Easy Company took part in some of the most difficult battles, including the D-Day invasion of Normandy, the failed invasion of Holland, and the Battle of the Bulge, as well as the liberation of a concentration camp and the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest. Drawn from interviews with survivors of Easy Company, as well as soldiers' journals and letters, making this miniseries very accurate upon dates and events that happened. This miniseries is very moving and  captures the wide range of the realistic responses to the stress and trauma of war fear, cynicism, cruelty, compassion, and all-encompassing confusion.<br /><br />The writing, directing, and acting are superb throughout. The cast is largely unknown, emphasizing the team of actors as a whole unit, much like the regiment; Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston play the central roles of two officers with grit and intelligence. It's clear and is shown in this miniseries that the things these soldiers had to do are both terrible and understandable, and the psychological price they paid is made clear. This also brings forward that these wars brought out some incredible acts such as unbelievable courage and sacrifices in some people while bringing out the worst in others. Here it shows both and makes this an unforgettable moving experience. This miniseries is very moving and captivating and I highly recommend this, for it's a fantastic piece of work.
0575081406|5.0|This story is fantastic. It was the best fantasy I read that year and one of the few that I read more than once. When you hear or read the plot synopsis it may feel familiar. Don't trust that feeling! The way that this story is told; its descriptions, character development, everything is a step beyond a normal fantasy novel. I can't wait for the next book, I ordered it about a year in advance.
031606792X|3.0|I was late jumping on the \\"Twilight Saga\\" bandwagon, but over the summer I picked up Twilight and finished it in two days. The same with New Moon & Eclipse. But Breaking Dawn was sorta a slow-read. It just didn't have the same intensity as the first IMHO. Renesmee was  a cute addition the the Cullen family, but like others I didn't really dig the whole imprinting thing on her. It wrapped up nicely though, but I did sort of wander if Bella would ever see Renee again..All in all I give it a 3/5
055358894X|3.0|This book was really entertaining but felt kind of shallow. It's more of an event based story than one driven by character development. You'll care more about what happens next than how what happens next will effect the main characters.  The main point I want to make about this story is that I read it and I liked it. But I don't want to and won't be ordering the sequels. Why? Mainly because I didn't really connect to anything in the book. I should have been sad when people died but I wasn't. The Lies of Locke Lamora is a page-turner that I didn't regret reading but won't be reading again.
B0000029J5|5.0|This reviewer has spent much ink in this space over the past year or so touting various old time country blues singers like Bukka White, Skip James and, of course, Son House. I have noted that their music reflected the rural southern, mainly Mississippi Delta. plantation life of hard toil (picking that damn cotton), hard living and hard loving from an earlier part of the last century. That age effectively ended on an economic level with the vast increases in the mechanization of agriculture and the migration of blacks north (mainly to Chicago and other Midwest industrial stops) in the period leading up to World War II. Musically it ended with the electrification of the blues guitar as the music headed north. That, however, begs an important question. Who would, if anyone, continue that old blues tradition?    Well we know part of the answer. The various white (mainly) urban folk revivalists of the 1960's, including the likes of Dave Van Ronk and Eric Von Schmidt and British rock aficionados like Eric Clapton of that same period held the tradition together by physically \\"discovering\\" the remnants of the old time singers like the above-mentioned artists. And by creating their own blues tradition. But what of now. That is where the artist under review, Keb' Mo', comes into the picture. He has gone back to the roots with some sassy, saucy, sexy songs (mainly of his own creation) that would do his predecessors proud. In the age of the `hip-hop nation' the sheer number of those who are committed to the maintenance of this music is surely much too small but the quality, as represented by Keb', makes up the difference.     So what is good here? \\"Anybody Seen My Girl\\" deserves a listen as does \\"Dirty Low Down and Bad\\" but if you have only time to listen to one give a listen to the old Robert Johnson tune \\" Kindhearted Woman\\" then you will know why the old blues tradition is still in capable hands. Kudos Keb'.          Note: I first heard of Keb' through part one of Martin Scorsese's six part 2003 PBS series on the history of the blues. I recommend that series for those who want a primer on the history of this music-then push on from there.
B001EO2UKO|2.0|I am a huge Dido fan and have anxiously awaited the release of Safe Trip Home.  Unfortunately, Dido has departed from what made her such an interesting artist and settled on a sound that fails to distinguish her from any other artist on pop lite radio.      Her first two albums artfully used electronica to create an atmostphere appropriate to her themes of heartbreak and disaffectation.  Even when the lyrics weren't particularly riveting, the music infused the songs with an urgency or pulse that, years later, still lends them a modern sound.    With Safe Trip Home, Dido has removed most of the electronica and relies upon a much more organic sound.  While it's nice to see artists branch out from tried-and-true formulas, the more organic nature of this album strips Dido's music of its signature sound.  Dido's voice is lovely throughout the album, but nothing stands out about any of these songs.      Moreover, while her songs have always been tinged with, if not celebratory of, sadness, removing the intriguing musical atmosphere gives the listener no reason to care.  Not a single song is upbeat or uptempo, causing one brooding song to simply roll into the next.  Indeed, I found myself checking my CD player several times to see if I was still listening to the same song or if a new one had begun.      I can only recommend this album to true fans and I suspect even many of those will be disappointed.  What a shame, as there is so much talent here.
0679731725|5.0|Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky have long been touchstones by which I measure how in tune an author is to the human condition.  To them I would add Kazuo Ishiguro.    In THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, Mr. Stevens' life, like peeling the cell-thick layers of an onion, is revealed ever so slowly.  Mr. Stevens had long ago set aside his humaness, emotions, and even intelligence in his pursuit of becoming 'a great butler.'   Variously he's laughable, lamentable, absurd, and downright infuriating.  More than once I wanted to shake the guy!  But at the end, when I realized that he realized the truth of his life, and how he, aided and abetted by his own, albeit unconscious, manipulation of memory, had sabotaged every chance for happiness, I broke down crying.   For Mr. Stevens is the Beatles' 'Nowhere Man':  'a bit like you and me.'  We all do the best we can with what we have.  No one can ask more of anyone else.    Yet there is a rainbow of consolation.  A small one, but what choice is there but to take it.      After I had read the last page, I went back to the beginning, intending only to compare Stevens' manner of speaking -- and ended up reading the entire book again.  And it was even better.  I couldn't possibly appreciate how brilliant Mr. Ishiguro's novel from one reading; even after the second, I knew that I would be reading 'Remains' many more times, and get more out of it -- and myself -- each time.
B001GQACGE|4.0|Beyonce took a chance with this release. She really believed that her star power is strong enough to push a 60 minute double CD. Unfortunately it did not work, I feel sorry for anyone who bought the standard edition because they will really feel short changed. At 11 tracks (standard edition)this CD is not very different from her first two but the double CD packaging makes us expect more.<br /><br />The 2nd problem I have with this release is the fact that Beyonce jumps on the pop rock bandwagon like Alicia Keys and John Legend before her. I enjoyed 'Irreplaceable' and 'No One (Alicia Keys)' as much as the next guy but I do not want a whole CD like that. Unfortunately for me \\"I Am\\" is a nothing but. Not to say the songs are bad but damn...whatever happened to soul music.<br /><br />\\"Sasha Fierce\\" fortunately rescues the album. Its bold, funky, energetic and very current. Bangladesh & Jim Jonsin prove that they are the real thing and they are ably supported by the rest of the production cast. Beyonce is in her element on these tracks and its a real compliment to her that she is equally comfortable on the fast stuff as she is on the slower songs. Also she really gets into character for this half of the CD and challenges her good girl persona.<br /><br />I'm itching to hear/SEE a live performance of 'Video Phone', 'Diva' and the rest of \\"Sasha Fierce\\". What I like about disc 2 is the fact that it still manages to sound different from what's out there in the R&B scene. Songs like 'Diva' may recall Lil Wayne but no one is doing that in R&B yet.<br /><br />Ultimately, the CD as a whole fails because of the packaging and the blatant attempt for radio. Its a real shame because the music itself is really good.

0790737345|5.0|WOW! Such a powerful movie! It is by FAR one of the best movies p.e.r.i.o.d. The chemistry was amazing, not to mention the acting, but of course when you have two phenomenal actors as Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan, your bound to have an excellent movie. City of Angels is no exception!   Cage plays Seth who is an angel that comes to collect the dieing, Ryan plays Maggie a heart surgeon...without telling you all the good parts Seth shows himself to Maggie and he ends up trading immortality to be with her.  Funny, heartwarming, and an all around great movie!
0312360266|3.0|I recently became interested in the Vampire novel genre after reading Twilight. Since reading it i have read about 10 other vampire series, including this one. Sadly this one is at the bottom of my recommendation list for other to read. The first few books from this series were very promising, which made me read all of them that are released but i was very disappointed afterward. I did not feel as close to the characters as i wanted to, or become attached, at all. And i felt as though there were many loose ends in the novels. I found myself asking questions about the story and characters that were given no answers. If you want to read a great story based on vampires, i would look elsewhere before reading House of Night.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|This is the best work from JP since Hell Bent for Leather. Been a Priest fan from the start. This is a must have. This CD rocks start from finish. Pure JP - screaming and mesmerizing Halford with the typical jammimg riffs by Tipton/Downing. A little bit of everything in this.  Not a bad song in the 2 disc set. Great change-ups.  Rock opera at its best. Off the chart lyrics. These guys just keep on getting better.  My favorite CD in years!

0870703781|5.0|The introduction to this book by John Szarkowski is the best essay that I've ever read about photography period.  It perfectly matches the photos themselves which I also believe to be perfect.  They may not mean much to you at first but keep on looking.  They are mysterious and baffling.  The book to me is perfect and a true ICON of american art.  Everything else pales in comparison, even other Eggleston books.
0060935464|4.0|It is perhaps appropriate that this was the first book I read after the election of America's first black President. My real reason for re-reading it, however, was for the purposes of comparison with Faulkner's \\"Intruder in the Dust\\", which deals with a similar theme. Indeed, I recently came across an allegation that Harper Lee's novel was essentially a plagiarism of Faulkner's.     The book is set in Maycomb County, Alabama, during the depression era of the 1930s. It is a first-person narrative told through the eyes of Jean Louise Finch who, for some reason, goes by the nickname Scout. Although she is only a child at the time of the events described, the narrative voice is that of the adult Jean Louise looking back at her childhood from some point in the future. The action of \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is set over a few days and tells the story of one single incident, the murder of Vinson Gowrie; \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is set over a period of about two years and essentially tells the story of Jean Louise's childhood between the ages of six and eight, although it concentrates on one crucial incident. The main characters, apart from Jean Louise herself, are her brother Jem and their friend Dill (another unexplained nickname; his real name is Charles).       Jean Louise and Jem are the children of Atticus Finch, a widowed lawyer. The book's central incident is the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, for the alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell; Atticus is Robinson's defence attorney. Like Faulkner, Lee uses a classic thriller plot- the fight to prove the innocence of a man wrongly accused- to explore racism in America's Deep South. Although Robinson is clearly innocent of the charge, the all-white jury nevertheless vote to convict him, largely because to admit that a white woman, even one as sluttish as Mayella, was capable of making false accusations would force them to abandon their cherished ideas about the purity of Southern womanhood.      Harper Lee's concerns are wider than just the race issue. The book also has a lot to say about attitudes to social class among the white community, contrasting affluent middle-class families like the Finches with the likes of the Ewells, who can quite literally be classified as poor white trash. The family live in a shack next to the town's rubbish dump, where Mayella's father Bob earns his living as a scavenger. A favourite saying of the liberal, tolerant Atticus, who believes that most people, when you get to know them, are essentially kind, is that you should never judge a man until you have stood in his shoes and walked around in them. (At times the tone seemed quite preachy, as though Harper Lee were writing an extended sermon on tolerance).     Atticus applies this principle of non-judgementalism not only to racial issues but also to various acquaintances whom his children dislike or disapprove of for one reason or another. He applies it to Boo Radley, a simple-minded and reclusive, but inwardly kindly, neighbour, to the cantankerous old Mrs Dubose and to the Cunninghams, another poor white family but one who have retained a greater dignity and self-respect than the Ewells. The title of the book refers to a saying of Atticus that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they never do any harm, but it is a phrase which also refers to his philosophy of life. At various times several characters in the book- Robinson, Boo Radley, the children- can be seen as \\"mockingbirds\\", harmless creatures in need of protection.     One problem with the book is that Lee never really explores the tension between Atticus's liberal philosophy of life, and the problem of human evil as exemplified in the book by Bob Ewell, who is neither misjudged nor misunderstood but just plain wicked. Not only does he give perjured evidence in the hope of getting an innocent man sent to the gallows, and encourages his daughter to do the same, he also makes a vicious and cowardly attack on Atticus's children. Trying to stand in such a man's shoes would not, I feel, be a very productive exercise.           My other criticism of the book would be that it explores the question of racism from an exclusively white perspective, albeit a liberal one. For a number of reasons I think that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a better book than \\"Intruder in the Dust\\", the most important being that Harper Lee's prose style is much more fluent and readable than Faulkner's often impenetrable sentences. Nevertheless, Faulkner creates, in Lucas Beauchamp, a black character who is much more well-rounded than any of those in Lee's book. Tom Robinson is little more than a plot device; the most prominent black character is Calpurnia, the Finch family's maid, who is that common literary stereotype, the faithful black servant. The book would have been better if Lee had given us a black perspective on the events she describes.                     Those criticisms apart, I found this an excellent book, with a number vividly drawn characters, especially the spirited, loveable young Jean Louise and her father, who was memorably played by Gregory Peck in the brilliant film adaptation. Despite the limitations of his world view Atticus is an admirable character, who shows, in his defence of Robinson, not only great moral courage but also great physical courage as well. The immense improvement which has taken place in race relations in America since 1960 is owed, in part, to men like Atticus Finch, and also to women like Harper Lee who were prepared to confront the endemic racist attitudes of their society.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|With hundreds of reviews in place, is there any need for another one?<br /><br />I'll leave that unanswered.<br /><br />Instead let me say that I went to see Ratatouille with my daughters. They had a wonderful, fun time, and might possibly have learned something about French restaurants. And I had a completely reasonable time, laughed some, and generally enjoyed myself. The Pixar folks have a pretty good handle on making kids films that adults at least tolerate, and often appreciate. Isn't that the definition of a family film?
0061537934|1.0|I'm a dog lover and wanted to like this story so much.  I'm actually shocked it's gotten such wonderful reviews.  Basically, it would be an okay book for a fifth grader, but unbelievably flat, boring, dull and silly for an adult.  It seems like a middle schooler wrote it!  The story is so lame and uneventful.  I'm embarrassed to have finished it, but kept thinking (hoping) it could get richer/deeper.  Sorry to say... you need to pass on this book... it's plain DUMB!

B001ED7C58|5.0|When I first heard the music, I have to agree it was not what i was expecting BUT that does not make it bad.  I had to decide to try and  listen objectively, not with my preconceived expectations for classical music like Edward and Bella enjoyed in the book.  After doing that, I really began to enjoy the CD.  Then, after seeing the movie and how the music fit each scene perfectly, I LOVE IT!   I have learned the words for almost every song, and it has become my favorite new CD. I even have a few as ringtones.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|For the ultimate in sexploitation & vulgar violence, see I Spit On Your Grave. The first 50 minutes, you get a giant rape scene,  the remaining 50 minutes she kills and castrates the guys.<br /><br />Any slasher movie connoisseur will appreciate the subtleties of  I Spit On Your Grave. The characters are memorable and fully developed. Much of the dialogue consists of zingers that you will remember long after watching the film. The hickish chauvinism of the men and the goofy grocery delivery guy are hilarious...not as hilarious as the tub scene mind you.<br /><br />If you dig exploitation flicks, and somehow this one slipped by you, get this immediately!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B001EC9V58|5.0|I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, you already know that this movie is the original predecessor to the recent American film Quarantine. As of this writing, I have not seen that film, so I cannot fully compare the two. However, I will note that it seems the only positive reviews of the American adaptation came from those who did not view this movie first.<br /><br />That being said, if you have seen and enjoyed Quarantine, I will wager that you will like this this movie. In fact, I consider this to be one of a very few \\"Must See\\" horror movies from the past 10 years.<br /><br />The story is simple, and has been relayed in countless other reviews here, so I will keep the synopsis short:<br /><br />A TV show hostess visits a local firehouse for an evening to see what a fireman's life is like, and upon finding that it can be boring, wishes there were some sort of call to go on. Soon enough, she gets her wish, as the firemen are called to an apartment building to rescue an old woman, something the firemen view as a routine call. However, upon arriving at the building, the group finds that things are not as routine as they expected, and they are quickly sealed in until further notice due to a possible outbreak of disease, with all contact to the outside world severed. As tensions rise among the tenants, the hostess and camera man set about documenting what they feel \\"the public needs to know.\\" What they find is more horrific than they could ever imagine...<br /><br />And now for my opinion:<br /><br />The scares in this movie are not your typical \\"jumpers,\\" meaning that they do not come from cheap musical effects while someone comes around a corner. No, the real scares here come from the dark, claustrophobic, hallways of the building and the noises coming from off camera. In short, the atmosphere of the film creates an edge-of-your-seat type of tension that slowly builds until something shocking pushes it over the top; where it begins all over again. In fact, even the things that I knew were about to happen still managed to scare me; something that is very rare these days.<br /><br />The movie also doesn't resort to cheap gore effects to frighten the viewer. Now don't get me wrong, I like the red stuff just as much as the next guy, but it seems too many movies these days are just laying it on to get a reaction. This doesn't mean that there is no blood in this film. In fact, there is quite a bit of blood, but none of it is spilled without any reason or effect. The same can be said for the \\"monsters\\" in the film. For most of the time, they are kept just off camera (though you can hear their odd noises in the background all along), but when they reveal themselves you certainly get the effect that the filmmakers intended. And while I'm on the subject, the \\"monsters\\" are not zombies, as people have taken to calling them; they are people who have been infected by something that is not clearly revealed (though it is hinted at during the final climax).<br /><br />The less-is-more approach used in this movie was perfect because, luckily, the directors kept the running time on the short side at a lean 73 minutes or so. This means that the movie avoids the dragging feeling that most others of it's type wind up producing (Blair Witch anyone?). Granted, the first 20 minutes or so (when the hostess is at the firehouse) are a little slow, but during that time you are basically getting to know the characters who will become your main focus, and this helps make what happens to them later all the more unpleasant. That being said, you must also keep in mind that once they get to the apartment building, the pace picks up greatly and the scares remain constant up through the last 10 minutes or so, where the situation explodes into a veritable frenzy of scares and suspense. In fact, these 10 minutes are the perfect culmination to the build-ups before them. Think of it as a roller coaster where they save the giant hill for last...<br /><br />In short, I think that all horror fans should really take a chance and watch this movie. Additionally, I would strongly advise against viewing the remake beforehand as I have the feeling that it may ruin the suspense since you will know everything that is in store and I've heard that it is much less atmospheric.<br /><br />I also would like to advise all those complaining that there is no Region 1 release of this movie to go out and buy a Region-Free player. Not only so they can watch this film, but because there are so many others of its caliber out there that will never make it to the States otherwise, and the bootlegs that do are usually costly and poorly copied. Seriously, they are about the same price as a regular player these days (I payed $120 for mine about 5 years ago and it still works great, which means they are probably about $70 now).

B001EOQWEO|2.0|The movie skips and doesn't play on my computer. However, it plays on my friends DVD players but not computers. Did my research and this movie holds yet another example of DRM. Thinking on returning to Amazon since I didn't rent it. Big dissapointment to see this things on great movies. Guess I'll go back to only renting.    Other than that, the movie deserves an oscar.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|the movie itself was awesome--good acting, nice storyline, super graphic scenes...and the graphics on bluray makes it SO MUCH BETTER! theres truly a difference with bluray VS reg. DVD's. just totally worth it!!
B00005JPTK|1.0|Don't waste time with this movie.  Lucky I didn't pay for it.  The Omega Man was much better.  This one was outright stupid.  Will Smith can't act, and the bald sissys terrorizing him reminds you of an Act Up revolt.  Richard Matheson's plot was drowned by the special effects.
1416594884|3.0|The hardest books to review are the ones that don't make you feel powerfully one way or another. This is compounded in this book because it actually operates on two levels. This is a novel on the one hand but it is also political commentary on the other. As a pure novel I neither thought the book was fantastic nor was it horrible. I haven't read LeCarre before so I can't compare this book to earlier outings but I found the prose a bit tedious in places and the characters not quite as full developed as I would like, but it is equally obvious that LeCarre isn't ungifted as a novelist. My take away is that LeCarre probably isn't a writer I will seek more books from, but if I were stuck without a book somewhere I wouldn't be afraid to pick up a novel by him to pass some time. As political commentary I am sure that many people will be polarized by this narrative and will express strong emotions but frankly I was just depressed. The amoral western intelligence agencies is a somewhat cliched depictation but not necessarily inaccurate for that. It is not easy though to simply say \\"bad guys\\" though because as organs of state security their function is not necessarily to be the good guys and wishful thinking aside, they do have other bad guys to contend with. I don't see any solution to the issues raised by this book, ergo I was just depressed to be reminded of how the world actually works. For me this was just an average book, but I can see clearly how some people will enjoy it and how some people will not. I'd say if you like LeCarre you won't find anything here to bother you, but if you're looking for something to make you feel good then this isn't going to be your cup of tea.
B001GQACGO|5.0|I listened to this album and it grew on me. It is showing her going in a different direction. This double album reveals a distinctly different side of her personality, character and sensibility, a forum for the yin-and-yang of her developing artistry. I AM....,provides Beyonce with a musical showcase for a group of intimate heartfelt ballads. SASHA FIERCE gives voice to Beyonce's up-tempo dance-oriented other side. With this album, she reveals a variety of musical aspects and interests that may take us fans by surprise. She has produced, written, recorded and performed a finely crafted selection of contemporary ballads that combine the best elements of pop and soul music while expanding the possibilities of both genres. I hope this album will be successful like her other ones. Get this album if you are a fan of Beyonce or R&B/Pop music.

The authors have done an excellent job in putting across the theme of, `...taking full responsibility for everything you do, think, and say.  The book doesn't tell you how to live your life. It does provide the reader with instructions on how to achieve a better and happier YOU.  According to the authors, \\"This book contains what [they] call the timeless `ingredients of success.' Just like there's a recipe for your favorite dish, there is a recipe for achievement too.\\"<br /><br />Their book consists of twenty chapters.  At the end of every chapter the authors include a \\"My-to do-List.\\"  An example of the list after the first chapter is as follows:<br /><br />1.[[ASIN:1932196536 The Kids on the Block]]\\"Realize that the person in charge of my life is ME.

031606792X|1.0|ive started getting my hopes up just after reading the first book twilight.. but it just started regressing towards the last book.. and all i can think of was i wanted to keep my sanity and find another good book to read to compensate for the wasted time i spent on this last book. \\"b-down\\" was dragged out a lot.. there was no actual plot until the last 1/4 of the book and when it finally came it just seemed flat, completely anti-climactic. it has more holes than i can count. i wish there were more vampire actions.. more fights.. maybe some sacrifices that will make the story more meaningful. a real battle shouldve happened that was anticipated from the beginning.  but it was a good thing that everything ended well.. the happy ending was actually compelling, still edward and bella and nessie together after everything.      but still.. i was very very very disappointed er nauseated! whats with all the jacob imprinting on nessie part? that is sooooooo wrong in soooo many levels!!! it makes me and a whole lot of people i know who read the book really sick! okay it was said that the reason why this imprinting took place was coz bella always sees jacob as family.. but they're already bestfriends.. what more should be proven? sigh. jacob will always be a big part of bella's life. being very good friends means that they are and will always be a family and that is priceless. it means a lot. thats justifiable already. thats special enough. why does it seem that it was forced on this part that jacob still has to be imprinted on someone connected to bella? oh and edward calling jacob his son towards the last part of the book? (i just couldnt stomach it). i just hoped that jacob imprinted on leah instead considering the two developed chemistry in the story. and still jacob is the best uncle and he will be protecting nessie all the time. that will make more sense, and the wolves will continue to be stronger allies of the cullens. jacob doesnt have to wait till nessie turns 18 or20 and know that they're more than friends. so his imprinting on the half-vampire daughter of his former love-of-his-life just to mean or forced he is still family- is truly unnecessary, it is so just not right. i cant and a lot of readers cant really stand it. i wish there was a poll about this imprinting lol.     and one last thing, something that is certainly essential that i couldnt get over with.. i hope the author showed here that edward and his daughter had more connection to each other.. more chemistry.. more bonding.. i hate the fact that the imprinting overshadowed this very important matter. please.. have mercy! huhuhu..     so if midnight sun will still be released, considering this is edward's point of view of twilight and onwards maybe, i hope it will be shown this time how close nessie and her dad is, important facts, details, how edward was longing to have a kid of his own and he thought it could never happen but it did.. how it is to be a biological vampire dad lol..how nessie feels about her dad too and him being very good friends with bella's bestfriend as well at last etc. and edward doesnt have to be jacob's father-in-law. i wish it was shown that jacob is finally at peace with himself towards edward in a way that it wasnt coz of the imprinting on his daughter and it doenst have to happen anyway to begin with. (it's difficult to accept it otherwise..)i know there are lots of things left unsaid.. so much to learn from edward's side. sigh.     so there, i hope it all goes well.. everyone, every couple, every coven, every pack, every alliance, every family,- WITHOUT THE IMPRINTING OF JACOB ON NESSIE- will be living their own lives but still be in harmony and close to each other if there really is a fifth book.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I don't buy too many cds these days because I find myself only listening to one track or two.  I pre-ordered David Cook's album because I loved his performances on AI and was hoping for a solid album.  I am not disappointed in the least.  I can listen to all the tracks without finding the need to hit the \\"Next\\" button.  My favorites are Avalanche, Declaration and Permanent.

The thing that kept me totally engrossed in the audiobook version was Jeremy Irons's reading.  I could listen to him read the phone book and not quit in the middle.  Mr. Irons should consider reading lots of good, serious, important, perhaps difficult, but unpopular books to increase the world's knowledge of them.  What a voice!!

On the plus side, the music swings - the arrangements and instrumental performances are very entertaining - but Mr Bennett sounds awful on this recording.  I wonder if he listened to this sad affair before it was shipped to the public.<br /><br />If he did, he owes us all an apology.  What a shame!
B000WTNCYA|4.0|Worrisome Heart is the first full length studio CD from Melody Gardot.  It is a smoky and mellow mix of jazz and folk that one should enjoy slowly as repetition leads to depth of appreciation and understanding.  Melancholy runs deeply through this short collection of songs.  While one might expect this from a young artist who survived being hit by a car while riding her bicycle, her torment on Worrisome Heart comes from another, but common, source.  Even the song titles themselves suggest that the primary source of her pain is from love gone wrong in one way or another.  Whether she pines for someone to take things slowly as in \\"Love Me Like A River Does\\" (\\"Baby don't rush/You're no waterfall\\") or the love from which she is separated on \\"Sweet Memories\\" (\\"Pretty soon I'll want the real thing instead/But for now I've got this sweet memory\\").  Gardot lyrically wears her heart(aches) on her sleeve.<br /><br />Yet these don't come of as a simple collection of poor me drivel.  Gardot has a vocal delivery somewhere between Diana Krall and Norah Jones, and she even mixes in scat singing on a few tracks.  Her producer, Glenn Barratt, did a wonderful job of setting Worrisome Heart against a rich and varied instrumental backdrop.  \\"Worrisome Heart\\" and \\"Love Me Like A River Does\\" both feature muted trumpet while the slightly upbeat \\"All That I Need Is Love\\" is set against a flowing clarinet line.  Other songs such as \\"Gone\\" and \\" Sweet Memory\\" feature strings and/or guitar.<br /><br />When you add it all up, you have a very musically mature sounding CD from a new artist.  While you won't likely find yourself dancing to or uplifted by Worrisome Heart, it is still a very fulfilling musical experience.  It is perfect for unwinding and relaxing after a stressful day.  As you see the beauty that Gardot makes of her own troubles, you will find your own to be somewhat lighter as well.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I don't know about that! To me, \\"Raiders\\" will always be the lame one of the bunch! \\"Raiders\\" suffers from the same flaws that \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" and \\"Batman\\" did: all dazzle and no substance. This one has the same non-stop action, character development, humor and incredible situations and juxtapositions that made \\"Temple of Doom\\" and \\"Last Crusade\\" so entertaining. However, there's a HUGE Spielbergian element in the hokey mysticism/science involved with the storyline. This is the childish way Spielberg handles ALL his science and/or eldritch goings-on in his movies, and you'd think Lucas would have held that aspect in check in this movie. Alas, he did not!<br /><br />You know the story by now: Indy's closest buds are now dead, (his dad, Marcus,) and Sullah is nowhere to be found. However, another character, Charles Standforth, played by Jim Broadbent, has taken the place of Marcus and has very little to do with this episode outside of being the bearer of bad news in the beginning of the film. Well, after having a run-in with the U.S. Govt. over the elaborate goings-on that open the film, (Indy being coerced into helping Russian operatives track down a mysterious artifact stored in Area 51 in New Mexico,) he's fired from his university job and then gets sucked back into further dealings with der Russkies after a mysterious young man yanks him off a train he was taking home. (*Spoiler Alert!*) What follows are chase scenes from hell involving Indy, a Russian cutlery freak straight out of central casting played by Cate Blanchett, an old colleague whose integrity he overestimated, his old flame, Marion Ravenwood, and surprise, surprise...LITTLE INDY!!<br /><br />After the SPECTACULAR image of the a-bomb going off in the New Mexican desert in the beginning, (and it's a major distention of suspension of disbelief to accept Indy surviving all that radiation,) it was obvious that the visuals in this film were going to be a major focus, as well as action, and the movie doesn't disappoint on either level. It's a non-stop art-director's extravaganza from beginning to end, and MUCH more substantial, I think, than \\"Raiders\\", still, to my mind, the weak link in the Indy oeuvre.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|\\"Wall-E,\\" which is one of Pixar's last films for Disney, is an absolute masterpiece -- a heartwarming, lively, funny film with a deadly serious message about the dangers of unconstrained mass consumerism, and a glimmer for hope on what may be a dying planet. You probably know the basic outlines of the plot -- Wall-E is the last of a series of small robot trash compactors. left behind to clean up Earth as the frightened remnants of the human race flee into space, to avoid the fallout from their mindless trashing of the planet. Almost by accident he catches up with the humans and finds them flabby and apathetic, each one permanently plugged into their personal entertainment/life management device, and utterly unaware of anything happening in the physical world.<br /><br />What Wall-E discovers, though, is that once the people become unplugged -- or are reached out to in any meaningful way -- their humanity and compassionate spirit emerges with surprising strength.  Left empty by a consumer culture that makes everything \\"easy,\\" the humans are ready for real-life experience and real-life connections, and are unafraid to make sacrifices to live, rather than simply exist.  The skill with which the Pixar folks tell this story -- and tell it in a way that is not noxious or saccharine -- is astounding.  These artists are at the peak of their form, and seem headed for even better things to come.<br /><br />As far as the reviews, etc., that found this film too bleak, or perhaps unsuitable for younger viewers, I'd say it's certainly worth a preliminary viewing by concerned parents, but it's not really as depressing or dark as early critics made out. It's certainly not as stressful a film as, say, \\"Finding Nemo,\\" which I do *not* find appropriate for really young viewers. It's worth previewing -- you won't regret seeing it one more time, and it will prepare you for any discussions you might want to have about with your kids about the environmental and social themes of the film. All in all, this is a highly entertaining movie with a substantive message, but it's not preachy or depressing. You'll love it.. your kids will, too.

B0015XASFS|5.0|For Josh Groban fans you won't be disappointed. 20 songs to sing live and it actually keeps you awake during the whole concert. Mixes some fast up beat songs with some slow ones. Great Concert ending with the two most popular songs \\"You Raise Me Up\\" and \\"Awake\\" as encores. The CD doesnt have much to offer however, but the DVD is defiantly worth checking out. For those of you who doesnt like listening foreign language songs it might not be for you cause he has a couple in there. Me myself used to not like his foreign language songs but it started sounding good to me. I guess its those kind of songs that you have to get used to. BUT this CD/DVD combo is defiantly worth checking out especially if your a Josh Groban fan and for those of you who doesnt know who he is, BUY THIS CD/DVD and you'll know why he is such an Amazing and Talented singer!!

006082543X|4.0|My daughter and I had a long car trip this summer in which we listened to a library audio copy of Coraline (charmingly illustrated by Neil Gaiman himself) and absolutely LOVED the story.  So, for Christmas, I had decided to give her a beautiful hardbound copy of the book to read together.    UNFORTUNATELY: this graphic hardbound novel is like a comic strip version of the novel.  DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE BOOK PROPERLY.  It would be more suitable as a keepsake or extra copy, but the regular text novel is too good to miss.  The description here on Amazon was confusing enough to make ME think that this would just be an extra snazzy version of the novel with SOME illustrations thrown in.  NO.  It's ALL comic strips all the time.    Sorry, but I'm a little miffed at Amazon, NOT the book.  A little more information would be nice on these kind of top sellers (at the very least, we could expect that kind of service).  As a very loyal amazon user, I am highly displeased at times with the lack of description on some items, and this is the worst thus far.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|As the ending titles came up for the latest James Bond adventure I have to say I felt a little numb.  Though the movie was not bad by any means some scenes just did not work for me.  The beginning car chase and rooftop scene was a edit nightmare for me!  I really cannot think of another movie that had so many cuts in a minute and a half time as this one did(it made BLAIR WITCH PROJECT/CLOVERFIELD camera work look like MY DINNER WITH ANDRE)I was really feeling nauseas.  The script was not original and I felt sometimes I was watching LICENSE TO KILL with revenge being the solid motive.  However I do like Craig and though he is not suave and debonair ala Pierce Brosnan  he is a brutal kick your a&& Bond that one can't help but like.  Also love the chemistry between him and M.<br />The Bond girls(only two????)are pretty indeed and their is plenty of killing.  Oh!  The title song was solid I felt.  Good Bond movie that I wished was great. Really hope that the 3rd movie with Craig A ETERNITY OF DESPAIR is far better.<br /><br />P.S.also prefer the famous gun scope entrance of Bond at the beginning and not at the end as was in this movie
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality,Sabbath's third offering,and possibly there heaviest,is a milestone in the Heavy Metal genre.    By 1971,the band had formed there sound fully and this was quite the step from there last two releases.  The result was a thicker degree of heaviness and the fact that it was just one MEAN record.    Each track is a classic,several among the greatest of all time.  Here's a look at the album's tracks:    Sweet Leaf-The band's ode to the joys of pot is unerlined by one of the most iconic heavy riffs of all time.  That beginning cough is Tony Iommi taking a bad drag on a joint!    After Forever-\\"Would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope,do ya think he's a fool?\\"  With a line like that you'd be shocked to learn this is actually pro-christianity!  Great deep album track that certainly dispelled the band's satanic image.    Embryo/Children of the Grave-A moody instrumental piece follows into one of metal's great metal anthems,sung with absolute conviction by Ozzy.  Covered,rather well,by Dio on the Live Evil album.    Orchid-Lovely acoustic instrumental by Iommi,showcases what you could get away with in Heavy Metal at one time.    Lord of the World-One of my favorite riffs ever,and a surprisingly neglected Sabbath song.  The song is about how the devil has corrupted our world,and the question of who is actually in charge of it.  Typically good lyrics by bassist,Geezer Butler.    Solitude-Depressing,soft song about Ozzy contemplating his existence and loneliness of love long lost.  Rates among the best metal ballads ever made,and one of the most underrated.    Into the Void-About as heavy as it gets!  Probally the stand-out track on this album,Into the Void was very ahead of it's times,with a structure that set the standard for many a metal classic to follow in the next decade.  That riff is quintessential Sabbath.    And so is this album.    Metalheads,Rockers and so forth,if ya don't got it,pick up a copy now!  Classic.
B001EO2UKO|3.0|Never having been a big fan personally of down tempo melodic female artists sitting on a stool with long hair and a guitar singing about lost love and other sadness I was knocked off my feet with Dido's appearance.<br /><br />I first heard of in Stan by Eminem where her \\"Thank You\\" was a part ... what a melodic almost godly voice ... after that I was hooked and loved both her two previous albums to an extend I still frequently listen to them on my Ipod on the plane or in the car. Then years of waiting followed and for the first time in a long time I visited the music stores in London and Copenhagen to check if the new album was out...<br /><br />Now it is finally out and I feel a slightly flat feeling. Hard to sum the experience so far up other than it is ok but leaves a feeling of being a non-event. Her voice is still beautiful but the tunes are forgettable mostly and too low beat even by Dido standards. Where the previous material cleverly mixed the slow passages with slightly more upbeat ones  it seems in this album that this variation has been left out. The sound is pleasant alright but a bit stale for lack of a better word.<br /><br />I acknowledge my long waiting and high expectations might have a strong effect on my disappointment and I thus opt to rate the album with 3 Stars. I see far too many reviewers tempted to make their point stronger by excessive use of 1 and 5 Stars.. In my mind very few movies, books or music albums deserve either.<br /><br />All other said it is still pleasant listening and had it been a debut album by another artist it would be very decent. No single title stands out and it is probably best listened to in its entirety before sleep. No need to send out video's and singles for sure.<br /><br />For an avid Dido listener this is a far cry from meeting the very high standards she herself set in album 1 and 2.
0786915749|4.0|This is really a wonderful book in the finest tradition of fantasy.  It is about a group of heroes who go out on a quest to defeat a GREAT EVIL.  LOLOLOL.....I can already see some of you hardened fantasy fans groaning.  But wait, there is hope.  Weis and Hickman are able to breathe such life into this cliched setting that you can't help but become enthralled.  And yes, the characters are straight out of a D&D campaign, but the authors succeed where others would fail in giving them each distinctive, captivating personalities.  This is the first of a trilogy, so be prepared for an ending not close to being wrapped up.  Overall though this book and the entire trilogy is pretty good.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|If you Like James Bond Movies, this is one of the Best..Also If you want to show off your Blu Ray system, this is the disc to show..the picture transfer is the best possible & the sould quality, out of this world.  Meanwhile This movie has all the Bond ingredients we have come to enjoy.  so go for the Bly Ray, you won't regret it.
B00063F8B2|5.0|The Polar Express soundtrack is one of our family favorites, the music spans from the music in the movie that the characters sing, to the Josh Groban song everyone is looking for, to the Standards Christmas Singers (Andrews Sisters, Bing Crosby) and to finish it all of Aerosmith's Rockin' on Top of the World.<br /><br />This cd runs the gamut, and it's great for the whole family.
B000UW8596|1.0|There is absolutely no point in ordering this DVD.  Criterion has a definitive re-mastered version now available.  It is a bit pricy, but it is infinitely better than this version.  I just tossed this one in the trash can.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|simply brilliant!!! Love the film and the complete Unique style of the visuals. I heard bad things from the reviews about this film, but when I took a chance on seeing it and buying the blu ray, I was simply astonished by it!    Being a fan of the original cartoon I thought the idea of a live action movie would lose the camp feeling of the series, but i was wrong. its faqntastic, and I'm quickly becoming a Wachowski fan.    and again love Michael Giacchino's score, brilliant music capturing the fun of the film. AND Matthew fox as Racer X was perfect!!    Seriously reccomend everyone at least give the movie a shot! It may not be to everyones liking, but it sure is a unique experience
1582701709|2.0|I bought this book a while back but just started reading it...not what I expected. I was debating whether to get this book or \\"The Last Lecture\\", and I opted to get this book. I don't understand how this book got such good reviews because it's pretty redundant and is not very insightful, it talks about the laws of attraction and how \\"like attracts like\\". I have not finished reading the book, but from what I have read, I'm not a big fan.
1400064287|5.0|This delighful and insightful book has something for everyone. I was initially turned off by the gimmicky cover of this book, but after reading multiple great reviews, I decided to give it a try. The name of this book comes from Malcolm Gladwell's book, \\"The Tipping Point\\" (which I also enjoyed). I enjoyed and learned far more from this book than Gladwell's (it is not necessary to read Gladwell's book prior to this). The Heath brothers try to teach readers how to create (or more importantly spot) \\"sticky messages\\". The authors show us that sticky messages are not merely useful for advertisers, but can be important in many different situations we encounter in life. You will become a better communicator which can be useful in personal as well as professional situations.    There are lots of books out there that teach readers new concepts but what sets this one apart is that the authors try to keep it simple (as per their own recommendation) and come up with a system that readers can remember and apply years later. Their mnemonic for the six characteristics of a sticky message is SUCCESs:    Simple  Unexpected  Credible  Concrete  Emotion  Story    Interestingly, the other fantastic book that I read a while back that I continue to think about also had six components which I still remember. It was Cialdini's \\"Influence\\". The Heath brothers refer to Cialdini in their book.    I highly recommend this book. Besides its educational value, it will dazzle and entertain you.
B000LC55F2|5.0|If you truly want to be entertained, and you appreciate magic (as in: professional stage magic and magicians) you will adore this film.    All the actors are at their best, here.  And, the film holds a bit of a surprise at the end, although cynical folks will say they saw it coming.    It's easy to say, after one has viewed the film, that it was all so obvious...but, it wasn't all so obvious on the first viewing.    Repeated viewings do yield some interesting gems, even when one knows what happens at the end.

0767903862|5.0|I read this book right before a trip to Australia, finished on the first leg of the flight.  The whole time traveling around the country (great place by the way), I found myself seeing and hearing things right off the pages.  My wife got so tired of listening to my chuckle and me trying to explain what was so funny that she read it on a train trip we did in our second week of the trip.  If you've got a trip to Oz in your future, get the usual travel guides but also get this book.
B0001FR3IQ|1.0|The story has a great concept i'll admit but the acting and such are just bad. why amazon recommended this to me i don't know.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I'm getting on the PT train very late here I know, but this is just a superb record. I've been listening to Progressive Rock since I was a teenager - Rush, Yes, King Crimson, UK etc. The new bands in this genre haven't really blown me away, but I recently picked up this record and I was shocked and how great the songs are, and how tasty the playing is. It took me a few listens to really get into this, but I'd say FOABP is as good or better than any album Rush has released since Moving Pictures. I actually played this for my 12 year old nephew who also totally loves it and has it on his iPod right alongside Radiohead and some old Prog stuff I turned him on to.<br /><br />The \\"prog rock\\" tag isn't really desired by any band, but suffice it to say, this record (and this band) sits right in the crosshairs of that genre. But it's worth a listen by anyone who digs smart rock music.
6304698690|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a little girl and bought it simply to remind me of childhood. Watching it as an adult has still been a great experience, I think it's a wonderful movie.
B0000C1733|3.0|I love RHCP and I was disappointed after finding out that there weren't a lot of tracks on this cd and that a lot of the songs were the slower ones. They are a great, diverse band with lots of different types of songs and I think this CD did not do the diversity a favor.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|Great compilation of songs. Some parts of the CD dragged on too much for me, but overall I enjoyed it!
B0013ND30M|5.0|Love this movie and I do not see any problem with the dragon slaying prince, the pretty princess and the evil witch! I think Disney has made a huge mistake staying away from classic fairy tales. There's nothing wrong with having classic stories being animated.<br />Anyways, the digital remaster looks fabulous and the 2nd disk really helps kids enjoy the movie more.
B0012Q732O|4.0|Okay, so this movie may not be the blockbuster hit of the year, but I actually thought it was halfway decent. First off, I love Stargate so I thought the not-so-surprising resemblance in certain areas extremely amusing. Also, the story itself is not so bad. Love conquers all, good vs evil, man vs nature, conincedence vs fate--they pretty much have it all.<br /><br />As for historical inaccuracies... well, really, who cares? Can we say '300'? Or any of the other hundreds of movies set in prehistoric/ancient/classical times that swerves so far from reality as to be completely unrelated? If it really bothers viewers so much, just do what I do: pretend it's somewhere else. Pretty easy, really.<br /><br />I will say that the best part of this movie had nothing to do with special effects (which I thought were fairly impressive) or the acting (which... did leave something to the imagination) or the plot (yeah...), but with the music. Harold Kloser did an amazing job with this music, even if parts of it do sound strangely similar to 'The Day After Tomorrow'. Eh, who cares? There are times when I can't tell the 'Independence Day' and 'Stargate' soundtracks apart, but they are both very good.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie was good and even if it isn't a I-must-have-this-movie flick, it's still good fun when your in the mood for a movie that's filled with beautiful scenery and cool prehistoric animals and Egyptian/Stargate-style sets.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I bought this movie for my friend on his birthday.  We happen to have a projector in our apartment and watching it on there was amazing!  The bigger the screen you have the better the action.  Downey Jr. cannot be beat.  This movie blew everyone away.  Most people thought it would be like every other comic movie, but this one actually has a good plot and good actors.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|My six year old and four year old love this movie, and as movies that get played over and over in my house, I find this one repeatedly entertaining. The nature of good and evil here does confuse my elder son, as he perplexed that one teacher can create a very good and a very evil student. Still, he is puzzling out that the world is a little more complicated than he once thought and having a great time doing so. The movie is fun, and if it makes a kid think a little --all the better.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I am only 20 Years old, And I knew a few songs for Abba, When I saw this fantastic movie, It made me see how Abba is a legend group!     Watched it 5 times already and my rate is 5/5!!!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This is worth watching for the gorgeous animation alone-the lush jungle where Horton lives, and the imaginatively wacky ton of Whosville. Throw in a funny story with a genuine moral message and a heartwarming ending and you've got a movie that's the kids will both enjoy and can learn from. I often wonder whether it makes a difference having big name actors do the voices-after all who cares about the voice if you're not seeing the face behind it. In this case though I don't think anyone would have been better matched for the voice of the off beat Horton than Jim Carrey. One of his best comic performances even if you don't see him.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|I bought \\"Saw III\\" because I needed to see it.  You have to understand, I am a large horror fan.  I am also a fan of TV shows like \\"Buffy\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Dr. Who\\" and \\"True Blood\\".  Therefore, suffice to say I like serials.  That's why I had to have \\"Saw III\\".  And (unfortunately) \\"Saw IV\\". (Heck, I even wasted money on the latest \\"Indiana Jones\\" drivel.)    When the first \\"Saw\\" came out, I was captivated.  Great villain, lots of gore.  I loved the whole mythology.  And due to the cliff-hanger style ending, I bought in for \\"Saw II\\" as well.     And \\"Saw II\\" was fine.  Decent story line.  Interesting characters.  Good amount of gore.  Liked it.      Then we come to Saws \\"III and IV\\", which according to Wikipedia happen concurrently.  I liked \\"Saw III\\" for the gore.  And the plot had enough twists to keep me interested.  There is also the inclusion of the pretty doctor and a good finale which appears to wrap everything up.  Or does it?     I have to admit I only bought \\"Saw III\\" because of seeing and enjoying Saws \\"I and II\\".  But it is a fine film, if you like the series and want to see how everything turns out.     Then I went out and bought \\"Saw IV\\", and as far as I'm concerned that's where it has to stop.  Watch the first three films and you'll see why.  \\"Saw V\\"?  \\"Saw VI\\"?  Give me a break.  What's next...  Jigsaw comes back to life in outer space (a la Jason X)?  No thanks.  Moving on....
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This CD is awesome.  It has so much emotion, especially after you've seenthe movie.....with a touch of humor!  Any person with any sentimental feelings at all would love it!
0374280967|2.0|After the initial cleverness of this book, which I did laugh out loud at a couple times thinking of the queen getting hooked on reading, it deflated for me. I think because the longer it went, the plausibility factor greatly diminished. I did pass along the book to a friend though, for grins.
B001H5X7JS|2.0|There's no doubt that Tropic Thunder is one of the funniest movies of the year- if not THE funniest movie of the year. I remember seeing in the theater and laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. I was excited when I found out that there was an unrated DC coming out... 2 discs, and 15 more minutes more footage.<br /><br />However, as much as I gotta say the movie rocks, I have to say: BUY THE THEATRICAL CUT INSTEAD. The unrated version slows the movie down a bit, and most of the added stuff doesn't seem to fit in. They changed some funny lines, and even took some out as well. In fact some of the added stuff makes the movie feel a lot longer than it really is, and after awhile the movie seems repetitive, which is one of the few things that killed the movie for me.<br /><br />So if you're planning on buying the DVD, get the single disc rated version instead... this movie is definitely one of the funniest I've seen, and I definitely look forward to owning it, but really, just get the theatrical. It's MUCH better.

0938045695|4.0|I have trouble understanding why some reviews of this book criticize it on the basis of lack of content.  I think the book is chock-full of content, so much so, in fact, that I seriously urge any reader to take Pavel's advice to re-read chapters.  I have repeatedly gone back to the book to refine my technique, finding details and emphases I missed in the past.    Others, who criticize on the basis of advertising content are also off the mark.  While there is some promotional material throughout, the bulk of it is in a handful of pages in the back of the book and is not intrusive.      Pavel does take the \\"hard core\\" this and \\"man's man\\" bit a little far.  To be honest, though, I think it's more in fun, as some of humorous pictures in the book hint that Pavel himself doesn't take the attitude thing seriously.    Pavel is heavy on precise technique.  This is for safety and also maximum gain from each exercise.  It is precisely this detail that makes the book so valuable.  Rather than simply describing a generic kettlebell swing technique, for example, Pavel lays the groundwork in preceeding chapters on hip flexibility and how to develop it, but ultimately covers grip, breathing, elbow and shoulder protection, callouses and hand maintenance, pull techniques, leg, hip, and back positioning, bracing, workout routines (e.g., ladders), and more.  So also for the heavy use on pictures of both good and bad technique.  Proper form is important in all weight training, but doubly so with the highly-leveraged dynamic movements used in kettlebell training.  Kettlebells aren't just dumbbells with a handle.    This is the most worthwhile book on basic kettlebell I've seen to-date.  If you're wondering whether to also purchase The Russian Kettlebell Challenge, the answer is no - Pavel makes it clear that this book supercedes the earlier volume and there have been some refinements in movement details.  His other books are complimentary, however, including Power to the People, The Naked Warrior, Relax Into Stretch, From Russia with Tough Love, etc.  (Each of which should be evaluated on their own, of course.)    On the topic of the few movements that are covered in this book, first, this is a beginner's book that hammers technique on a few things.  Second, these movements cover a lot of muscle groups - a few genericized exercises like this are highly appropriate for beginners.      There's a quote in the book to the effect that kettlebell swings alone are better for strength and conditioning exercise than almost anything else you can do.  Believe it, but you won't find out why unless you do them properly and with sufficient resistance.  Couple swings with movements that work the shoulder girdle, arms and upper back and you have something powerful and simple.  That's the basic premise of this book, again, targeted at beginners and non-elite athletes.  Having gone through it myself, I think it has considerable merit.    Pavel does not discount specialized and sport-specific training.  On the contrary, he says in the book that people involved at a certain level not only have to have specialized training, but need coaching from experts in their field.  Some readers are apparently mistaking his emphasis on general strength and conditioning training for a disdain for other exercise, movements, and training. Nothing could be further from the truth.    My only problem with the book is that whoever edited it could have done a far better job organizing the material.  I found that you really have to read the book cover-to-cover several times to put it all together.  You can't take it a chapter at a time as you progress, except perhaps for the section covering preliminary work for flexibility.  In a similar vein, some of the writing describing details of certain moves could be clearer.  While the book describes 3 distinct workout programs (not routines), it's actually quite difficult to discern where they begin and end, and how to put together routines to implement each program.  Pavel gives some general guidance in putting routines together, but it's not sufficient if you don't have the knowledge or confidence to do it - and a good portion of the audience for this book will have neither.  In the case of Enter the Kettlebell, having a beginners video is helpful, as it helps in getting around some of the ambiguity.  I prefer Art of Strength's \\"Clinic\\" DVD.  AOS also publishes a progressive workout routines book based on Enter the Kettlebell.  I have them but again, still find myself going back to Pavel's book for refinement.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Lot's of action and special effects. Not to thrilled with producers selection of the lead man.
B00004TEUX|5.0|These 1957 and 1960 classic performances of Mendelssohn's masterpieces \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and the third symphony, \\"Scottish\\", are simply the best available. Since they first appeared on LP, they have been among the primary choices for classical music connoisseurs.<br /><br />Listening to them for the first time, one will notice unbeatable, splendid performances, with a perfect grasp of every detail and the overall structure and spirit of these works as well.<br /><br />The Swiss conductor Peter Maag (1919-2001) is not the most well-known conductor on disc. He studied theology for Karl Barth and Emil Br&uuml;nner; philosophy for Karl Jaspers; and - most importantly - music for Alfred Cortot (piano), Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler, Ernest Ansermet, and Franz von H&ouml;sslin (conducting).<br /><br />It is possible to trace the influence of Furtw&auml;ngler in these performances. First, the performances are very powerful, with clear contributions from all departments. Second, the interpretations are significantly individual, demonstrating a superb knowledge of these works but also the hallmark of a great conductor's deliberations.<br /><br />Now there are many excellent performances of \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" on CD. Here are my selected comparisons:<br /><br />Klemperer (1961)<br />Krauss (1950)<br />Kubelik (1964)<br />Previn (1977).<br /><br />Only Previn's 1977 recording is complete in the sense that all of Mendelssohn's music for Shakespeare's play is included (Kubelik's selection is almost complete). All the others are selections, with Krauss, Klemperer and Maag presenting the same selection:<br /><br />1. Overture op. 21<br />2. Scherzo<br />3. March of the Fairies<br />4. \\"You spottd snakes\\"<br />5. Intermezzo<br />6. Nocturne<br />7. Wedding March<br />8. Funeral March<br />9. Dance of the Clowns<br />10. Finale<br /><br />This could be seen as the \\"standard selection\\". What you get is the core of these outstanding pieces. Of course, Previn's classic recording is unbeatable in terms of completeness. But as a performance, good as it is, it lacks the punch and brio of Maag's interpretation.<br /><br />Now, even if I cherish and rank Krauss', Klemperer's, and Kubelik's interpretations very highly, I think Maag must be the first choice. The reason is that Mendelssohn's incidental music has never sounded better on record. It is a stunning performance. Sound is fine, despite the age of this recording (51 years old), and the orchestra plays with ultramost dedication. It's a feast for your ears.<br /><br />The performance of the third symphony, recorded three years later (1960), is in the same class. References include Klemperer (EMI) and Abbado (DG) But Maag is, again, without real competition.<br /><br />Strongly recommended!of Maag's interpretation.

0743496736|3.0|I've read all Jodi Picoult's novels after I read the first one, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". The twist at the end of that book was truly well-done and unexpected, and I loved the writing and the emotional pull of the subjects. Picoult is a great writer. However, I've read many of her books after I read \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", and I can't help but be disappointed, every time. The books are all emotionally provoking, masterfully written, and interesting...until the end. With the exception of \\"Mercy\\" and \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", I've found the endings of all her books to be disappointing. Not because they're bad endings, but they're so plain and boring that they're a complete letdown from the rest of the book, which is beautiful.    I wanted to give this book four stars, because the entire book (except for the ending) is lovely. But I felt so crestfallen after finishing it, because during the entire book she had been building up the mystery about what really happened in the locker room, and everything is so emotionally charged that I expected a dramatic and deliciously shocking ending. But it was none of these. The twist isn't really a twist at all, and it felt forced and abrupt.
0307387178|5.0|This is not normally the type of book I read,but I am so glad I did.It's moving, and amazing. The story being recounted is quite interesting. (Later I saw the movie which seems very true to the novel, but is far more boring and slow moving than the novel- although the casting seems perfect.) Kraukauer is a beautiful story teller and lets you see the full character (smart but stupid, selfish but loving) boy who only wants to \\"walk into the wild\\" You can tell he loves him, but also wants to tell the truth. He is sensitive to those left behind and wants to depict Supertramp's final adventure as he might want it told himself. The book is interesting, and will make you sad, angry, and annoyed. It will remind you of the differences in humans, and how some people can be lost even unto themselves. The book pieces together fragments of the final months, year of Supertramps life to build a story of who this person was up to the tragic end.
B00168OINK|5.0|Disney who?<br /><br />Dreamworks offers up another great family movie (there is almost no such thing as \\"kids movies\\" anymore unless they are educational!).  Kung fu Panda, also known as Po, gives us a chance to see that an unlikely hero can save the day and understand a message that the best of the best can't always see.  There are tons (pun intended) of laughs, adventure and the thrill of rooting for the underdog.  This is a movie for the kid in all of us (much as Shrek has become) and yet another gold star for Jack Black's comedy stylings.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|I loved her first CD, and love this one as well.  \\"Love Story\\" is a song that is stuck in my mind, playing over and over every day.  Her songs are unique and catchy, even if they are centered around her age.  I am a 47 year old female and I am a fan.  She is also a true performer on the stage.  Very entertaining!
B000002N3N|5.0|As someone who has friends who don't share my eclectic taste in music I don't have many places to share my love of what I do like. That's why I like coming here and writing reviews of stuff I love. I reviewed Enya's recent Christmas album and it was a painful experience because it just didn't live up to my hopes. I hated writing an average review of an artist I respect so much... so I decided to review an album I consider my favorite.<br /><br />There are a lot of differing opinions on what is Enya's best work, least favorite work and all in between. For me, this album don't have my favorite Enya song (That would be Flora's Secret from A Day Without Rain) or my favorite instrumental (Shepherd Moons from the album of the same name). But this album is probably my favorite overall for many reasons. I love the gentle feeling this album gives off. If I'm having a bad day it's a nice album to cool off to. I love the two songs \\"China Roses\\" & \\"Hope Has A Place\\". Very beautiful songs. \\"Pax Deorum\\" is a very epic sounding song and quite a neat piece of music. I'd love for Enya to explore this kind of musical landscape again. She does this kind of thing so well! \\"On My Way Home\\" is an excellent \\"Orinoco Flow\\" sounding, up tempo close to the CD.<br /><br />Also, this was my first Enya CD so it also holds sentimental value to me. Ever since I've listened to this album I've been a die hard fan of Enya. Many people call this elevator music or boring. That's fine, I understand & appreciate how we all can have differing opinions of what kind of music we chose to enjoy. I hope some people give this album a chance & end up loving it as much as I did!
0143036424|5.0|I must agree with the reviewer stating \\"I had trouble following who was saying what. I had to go back and readdress the paragraph heading to see who was speaking\\".   while I enjoyed the book immensely, this aspect was very annoying. The author needs to pay attention and clarify who is making the statements, etc. Wonderful book, cannot wait to get his other books. The Indian 'spirits' occuring in the snowy woods was a little bit much, but perhaps easily overlooked. All in all, a great read!

I wish I would have known about this book while my dad was still alive.  He suffered through several strokes and died in July.  It gave one a new perspective on what a stroke patient is going through, which would help a love one and caregiver provide empathy for the patient.  The end of the book makes you realize that we humans spend way too much time on things that do not matter and we miss out on a lot of living because of the time spent on such insignifiant events.

Inspired musicianship from Tony Williams ,Larry Young, and John McLaughlin.<br />the singing is actually more like talking its infrequent and not bad at all.<br /> the poor sound quality is the complaint most encountered , this is minimal.<br />All musicians are heard clearly! and now is your chance to snap up a fusion, jazz rock or whatever you want to call it ,masterpiece.<br />lets just call it inspired music

B0010V4TZU|4.0|I stumbled across a track of theirs on Starbuck's radio, and liked the sound.  The CD didn't disappoint.  A driving beat and funky instrumentals.  Different.
B001GQACGO|5.0|I absolutely love B's new CD, despite what haters are saying...trust me when I say haters.  I'm a loyal fan who has ALL of beyonce's CDs, so I feel that I can offer a qualified opinion of the work on this album.  I believe some of the reviews you'll see posted on here are from people who may have purchased Beyonce's very last CD and was hoping that this CD would be same...and when it wasn't you can tell that that's the reason they are dissapointed.<br /><br />I love the fact that this CD doesn't sound like the others...that's what Artists are supposed to do...that's why they are ARTISTS, their job is to CREATE music, not just play along with the status quo.  So, make no mistake about it, this CD is great because it's a breathe of fresh air which is different than the stale overplayed music that's sitting on the air waves right now.  So, if you're looking for this album to just be a continuation of her last CD, you'll definitely be dissapointed and I wouldn't recommend you purchase this particular album.<br /><br />If you're a loyal fan of Beyonce, you'll notice that she is a artist that continues to evolve, both artistically and fashion wise.  She hardly ever does the same thing twice and she's definitely a trailblazer.<br /><br />This album reminds of the full package of Beyonce PLUS more. If you're a loyal fan you'll notice that when Beyonce first came on the scene, way back when with Destiny's child, their songs were fierce with R&B beats flying off the walls of any club.  You'll notice that there are a few \\"gangsta qaulity\\" songs on here as well, such as Video Phone.<br /><br />The song \\"Diva\\" was so clever...I know the guys have their anthem song called Amili by Wayne but this is the female version.  GO BEY!  What other female artist is putting out music that celebrates \\"who we are\\" and \\"how hard we work\\" to attain our status...NONE.  So, again, GO BEY!<br /><br />For a few of the fans who loved B's last album \\"B Day\\", there are a few songs on here for you too such as \\"If I were a boy\\", and \\"Broken hearted\\"  Basically this song has a different beat to it, reminds me of an artist who's trying to \\"cross over\\", but DANG it sounds so great and it's something that every woman can relate to being that we mature a lot faster than our counterparts.<br /><br />There are some songs on here I label as \\"cross-over\\" because the beat sounds a bit country: That's why you're beautiful and If I were a boy.  These two tracks are beautiful songs, but I do know and can tell you that you find songs like this on any of her last albums.  She's mixing a little bit of R&B and Country music and that's what I like and appreciate: An artist who can expand my mind and take me new places, sort of like reading a book.<br /><br />On this CD package she's definitely done something different that other artists haven't done.  In my opinion, instead of the CD could have been seperated into three because there's (1) Hood Songs (2) Slow down to earth sultry ballads (3) Female anthems along with (4) A few bonus Country songs.<br /><br />In my opinion, as a loyal fan, and an avid follower, I think this CD is awesome because it gives you the wide range of that most artists won't dare to venture into.  No matter how you're feeling one day, Bey definitely has a track on here to celebrate your mood, whether heart broken, a song to celebrate womanhood, or a song to hype you up before you go club hopping!<br /><br />I love it! My favorite tracks on the bonus tracks release are: \\"Hello\\" and \\"Ego\\" which is when she opens up her heart about her relationship with Jay-z.hearted\\"  Basically this song has a different beat to it, reminds me of an artist who's trying to \\"cross over\\", but DANG it sounds so great and it's something that every woman can relate to being that we mature a lot faster than our counterparts.

1596680296|1.0|I bought this book based on its great reviews. I am finding it very difficult to follow. The authors keep referring to Needle 1, Needle 2, and Needle 3 and then say see Figure 1, 2 etc. ---- well, none of the Figures have any labeling on them as to which needle is which. I don't know what the other sock books are like, but I don't recommend this one.
B001GQACGO|5.0|The album is the bomb!!!!!!! Disc one really shoes that she has grown up. It's also the disk that I listen to when I want to relax. disc two \\"WOW\\" I love disc two Ego, Ring on it, and Video OMG. You have to take chances and try different things. Beyonce pulled that off for sure!!!!!!!!!!     P.S.-To all the Haters that have jumped on the Rhianna band wagon. No one complained when she went from Island queen to Pop superstar. How did she pull that off? She switched up her style and stepped her game up. Stay on top off your game Beyonce. AKA the trend setter!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000URDEB0|5.0|Unlike most people that have reviewed this CD, I believe that this is one of, if not, the best CD Nightwish has put out. For one thing, the greatest song on their greatest hits was the Pink Floyd remake, \\"Hope.\\"      The new vocalist Annette, is by far a greater addition to this band. Maybe i wasn't the biggest Nightwish fan, but now I am going to be a loyal fan as long as they have this vocalist. In my opinion, this is a must have and the best Nightwish has to offer.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I watched this movie almost like I would have watched a fairy-tale. Actually, considering, I would say Zach is a modern Cinderella... His desires always came second after his family's and he didn't even realize how much his sister (or his absent father for that matter) took him for granted. And when his chance to have a life eventually came his way he almost pushed it away. Felt bad for Shaun - who didn't deserve at all Zach's rebiffs and second thoughts - but oh, how understandable these second thoughts and self-guessing were...  It would be difficult to choose favourite moments in the movie. There were several - loved a lot the 'fast forward over few days' silent scenes - the first showing the beginning of Zach-Shaun relationship and the last one showing a glimpse of their and Cody's life, the touching moment of Zach's apology, the comic of almost-discovery by Gabe of our couple in bed and so many others.  And, if there was any doubt, there is a happy ending. To paraphrase a publishing site, maybe there is not the certitude of 'happily ever after' but there is absolute a 'happy ending for now'. Which, considering your own quota of optimism could easily be upgraded to 'ever after'.:-)  I highly recommend this movie. It will prove a very enjoyable entertainement and will leave you smiling happily at 'the end' moment.   If you seek for more however, a big movie to make you thinking etc, this is not it.
B0017MO10U|4.0|The quality is good but we live in Australia and our problem is that we can only watch the DVD's on our computer as they won't play on our DVD and TV. There must be something wrong with the formatting oe something, but we can watch them on the computer which is ok but disappointing.
1416594884|2.0|John has written some wonderful books, but should throw in the towel. It's sad to see the author of so many great books putting out the books he has been doing lately. After his last book I vowed not to read any more of his. However, I was talked into trying this one.It might be a shade better than the last one, but nowhere up to his previous standards.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|'Bladerunner' is one of the greast Sci-Fi movies ever.  It depicts a future both technically sophisticated but, at the same time, a morally degraded freak show.  After so many great reviews I'll make no effort to condense this great film.  The action revolves around the fact that technology has evolved to the point that it can produce artificial humans, or 'Skin Jobs', as they are contemptuously known.  These individuals are basically biological robots but, instead of machinery, they are composed totally of human tissue.  They have been produced with different purposes in mind and, in the film, we see...in the several 'Skin Jobs' depicted...advancing levels of technology.  The most advanced model is 'Roy', blonde, powerful, beautiful and deadly [here we see a reflection of Nazi superman theory].<br /><br />Unfortunately, all models, because of their perceived danger to the human race, have an inbuilt defect--they are limited to a very short life.  They are sentient enough to resent it and active enough to do something about it.  Four escape to earth to try to gain the secret of longer life.  It's a desperate ploy, especially because Harrison as the 'Bladerunner' has been commissioned to destroy them.  Great stuff really and better yet because no one has yet been wrong enough to try to serialize this great film.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico
0894803123|5.0|We purchased this book at the same time as we invested in Cuisinart's Indulgence Ice Cream Maker. Both were excellent purchases and make a great team.    Please read the introductory pages and sidebars in this book. Not only a fun read but also enlightening and encouraging for small business dreamers and ice cream makers.    All of the recipes I have tried say they make a quart. This is a generous (of course) quart because generous is part of Ben and Jerry's philosophy.     We like a little sweeter chocolate so I substitute semi or milk chocolate for their unsweetened chocolate squares. I also use a microwave to melt the chocolate rather than double boiler. Just my preference.    We started reading some of the book aloud to our teen kids and they asked for more!  Along with their ice cream, of course.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already?  This is a comedy about a grim subject but WHAT a comedy.  The characters are literally to die for.  Obviously Peter Sellers in his many roles is terrific but it's tough--even for Sellers--to top his truly odd character, Dr. Strangelove.  Strangelove's previous work for the Nazis has left him with a strange schizophrenia in which is right hand, quite literally, doesn't know what his left hand is doing.  It's constantly flying up in an attempted Nazi salute and, by the end of the film, like the B-rated horror flick \\"The Hand\\", tries to strangle the confused Dr. Strangelove.<br /><br />Slim Pickens is equally great as the hilarious cowboy B-52 pilot who, overcoming all odds, Russian and U.S., flies his bomber in low, fast and deadly to deliver a nuclear bomb fated to--indirectly, at least--destroy the world.<br /><br />Then there's Sterling Hayden with his obsession with the purity of his bodily fluids, women and Communists.  Sterling has figured things out, though, and 'punishes' women by depriving them of his bodily fluids.  He also lauches the nuclear strike doomed to--yep--set off the Russian \\"Doomsday Machine\\" that will utterly demolish the earth and all life upon it.  Great fun.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico
0385338724|5.0|A great read, with some humor inserted at just the right times.  I passed it on to my sister and she loved it also!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Bought this for my 10 year old as he loved David Cook on America Idol.  He listens to it every night.  Great for a David Cook fan.
0307269752|4.0|I found this book to be rather slow in the beginning but it began to pick up and, as of the middle, was so suspenseful that I couldn't stop reading until I finished it.  Others have written of the plot so I won't be redundant but I thought that elements of it were reminiscent of Grisham's THE FIRM - and that the book would make a terrific movie.<br />As for the writing and the place, Larsson presents a fascinating picture of male-female relations, family dysfunction, morality, media and business in modern Sweden. The writing style is deceptively simple but very effective in making his characters and their circumstances come alive. His heroine is almost an anti-heroine and reminds me in some ways of Lee Child's Jack Reacher.<br />While it's clear that violence against women is at the heart of the book, Larsson doesn't preach at the reader but just lays out the facts.<br />Excellent book, highly recommended.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|I wanted to enjoy this first CD by Jennifer Hudson and was not disappointed.  I especially appreciate the clarity with which Ms. Hudson sings the lyrics and the feeling she gives them.  I predict several hit singles from the CD and all of them have her singing solo.  Here's my order for the hits (I didn't include Spotlight, her first single release):  We Gon'Fight, Giving Myself, Invisible.      The only duet that I came close to liking was the one with Fantasia.  Fantasia has a great singing voice but the producers of her duet with Jennifer would have served her better by sharpening her speaking voice.  Unless they intentionally wanted her to sound bad.  Keep moving higher, Fantasia!       Okay, back to Jennifer.  It was almost eerie that the single gospel song that she chose for her CD is Jesus Promised Me a Home Over There.  She gives a stirring rendition.  Following the deaths of her family members, I couldn't help but think how fitting this song is.    Ms. Hudson has a long, bright career ahead of her.  May her mother smile down from \\"the home over there.\\"
B001ACH4DS|4.0|The typical Idol debut record is cranked out within 6 months of the end of the TV show to capitalize on the holidays and to mitigate the effects of the public's short-term memory and the impending next season of Idol.     As a result, the typical Idol debut record is fairly predictable (gotta keep the Idol stable of writers/producers busy!), safe (have to appeal to grammas and tweens who watch the shows) and engineered for maximum Top 40 single appeal (The Man gotta get paid!) Consumers get Another Idol Record - 2.5 Stars, good enough to tide over till next season's favorite, but nothing memorable.    This is not the typical Idol debut record, despite being subject to the same time and corporate strictures as previous Idol records. Firstly, David Cook was not handed a sheaf of prewritten songs to sing -- he has cowrites on 9 of the 12 tracks and a solo credit on the closing track. Secondly, the music is not the same old generic spun-sugar pop -- it's rock, it's big and epic, and omg there are actually a couple of sexy songs on there. Thirdly, the lyrics are heartfelt and intelligent, with some nice wordplay and music of their own going on with the sounds of the words.     The songs range from delicate piano/string ballad \\"Permanent\\", to 80s throwback powerballad \\"Light On\\", to high-energy bright \\"Declaration\\", but tying it all together is David's distinctive, strong voice and intuitive delivery. Credit should also go to producer Rob Cavallo for engineering a disc with a cohesive flow and identity.    The two critiques I have are that some songs suffer from overproduction (10 guitars is not always better than 2) and that a string of midtempo songs make the CD sag near the end. Apparently the label was insecure about preserving what they thought Idol viewers wanted. I think they should've just let David and Rob Cavallo loose. The fun hidden track \\"Kiss On The Neck\\" (12 minutes into track 12) and swagger-rock track \\"Bar-ba-sol\\" hint that there's harder stuff waiting inthe wings, once we cut this silly Idol umbilical cord. Let's make a date for the sophomore album, yes?
B00006JDVV|5.0|The only thing that  I have to said is that the DVD is in good condition and the delivery was fast.
B000000OQF|5.0|No reason to give anyone an actual review here.  Just go out and listen to the album.  Every song is classic; and most of all pure rock-n-roll. If you can come up with a better debut album from any \\"hard rock\\" band, please let me know.  In the meantime, just listen to this mammoth accomplishment.  Amazing what a handful of douche bags can accomplish.  Forget their late stuff save November Rain and a few other tracks and GnR Lies the album.  This is it.  It's f'ing amazing stuff.
0345495004|1.0|How is it possible to bore a reader to death with a story of celebrity, artistic acheivement ,passionate love, adultery, and murder? Just ask Nancy Horan, the author of \\"Loving Frank\\", the story of the scandalous, and ultimately tragic, love affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mameh Cheney.   Let's give Horan her due.....she is consistent.  She never misses an opportunity to gloss over a conflict or miss a dramatic moment. In one sentence she decides to leave her husband and small children; in half a page we have the account of murder and mayhem that left seven innocents slaughtered.  The book reads more like a student research paper than a book of fiction.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This has to be the best Marvel movie so far.  It is like reading a well written classic novel.  The movie is well structured from start to finish.    I like the way how Tony is casted into different characters in the movie.  What I want to say is that the Ego, Super-Ego, etc. which are part of Tony are being played by different characters in the movie.    I have the Blu-ray 2 disc copy.  The movie is great but the extra and two documentaries are kinda boring.  And the BD-Live never works with my PS3.    Overall, this is a great movie.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I don't listen to records anymore. I hear a single. I like it. I buy it. I don't bother with the record because I never end up liking more than a couple songs. With David Cook. I can honestly say that I like almost every song. Especially the Easter Egg. My favorites keep changing and I even go back to a song I might not have been hot on at first and find something I like about it. The songs on this record are crying to be heard live, in an epic concert atmosphere. Stand out Tracks: Bar-ba-Sol, Lie, Mr. Sensitive, Declaration, Heroes, Kiss on The Neck, Avalanche, Permanent, Come Back To Me and the epic closing song A Daily Anthem.
B001GM0GNC|5.0|I am so thankful that this cd/dvd set was released!! I have been playing it over and over again since I purchased it. The first dvd disc is the concert in Argentina. I was very impressed at how good the band sounded in a live performance! It was so much better than the dvd Synchronicity concert! Viewers will also be impressed with Andy Summers' guitar solos. For fans that loved the first album, Outlandos D'Amour, this concert will definitely become your favorite...There are so many songs performed from this album! \\"Truth Hit Everybody\\" is one of my favorite   performances on this disc! The second dvd is was great,too!  It's a behind the scenes look at The Police rehearsing for the tour and a surprise performance at The Whiskey,in Los Angeles!! The other 2 discs are of the concert which any Police fan will enjoy listening to at home or in the car!  This dvd/cd set was more than I expected. You will definitely feel the nostalgia when you sing along to the concert!
B0002858YS|5.0|When I first heard a Killers song on the radio I thought it was okay, then I saw them on SNL and found them interesting.    Eventually I went and purchased this CD and I am very happy I did.  Maybe they are not breaking new ground here, and their influences can be heard, but it still works.      They are combination of The Cure, Depeche Mode and even U-2 (as you can hear on Midnight Show ) with a bit more of a rock leaning than some of the 80s bands such as The Cure, with songs that are very well done.      The first time I listened to the CD I was able to listen to it all and it kept me listening to the entire record with solid songs.  If you like pop/rock/synth blends you will like the.
B001GQACGO|4.0|It was amazing just watching it and listening to what she had to say about the album.<br /><br />\\"Life has to have a balance\\" she said. I don't disagree!<br /><br />Anyway, this album is nice. At first, I was thinking that the first CD was better than the second but the uptempos are growing on me, especially Video Phone. It kinda reminds me of B'Day a bit and I loved that album after a few listens.<br /><br />From the first album, my favorites are IF I WERE A BOY, DISAPPEAR, AVE MARIA, SMASH INTO YOU and SATELLITES (which had to grow on me).<br /><br />The second album is more dance/fun-oriented. Almost every track has a back beat and is anything but soft. My faves here are SINGLE LADIES, RADIO (love it/killer dance vibe!), SWEET DREAMS, VIDEO PHONE and EGO.<br /><br />I'd advise all fans of B's to try it out, especially if you liked B'Day and/or love her ballads because the first CD is full of them!<br /><br />4 stars.<br /><br />end note: This is the version I own, and this is the version TO own. It has 5 more songs than the normal version does. Don't miss Ego and Satellites. If you have the original album, download those two tracks also.<br /><br />Update: 5/30/09 -- My thoughts on this CD are a bit changed. I'd rate it lower than 4 stars. More like a 3.7 stars.<br /><br />Some of the songs are just \\"meh\\".
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Season 4 of this incredibly addictive television series picks up where season 3 ended off... in the future (or the present...technically).  After three seasons of Lost, the format had begun to get a bit stale.  While flashbacks for newer characters such as Desmond, Ben and Juliet had made for some interesting episodes, many viewers became bored with Kate running, Sawyer conning and Jack pining.  Seeing this as well as any viewer could, the creators of Lost decided to switch things up a bit in the fourth season.  The \\"flash forwards\\" as they have come to be known added an intrigue to the show that hadn't been felt in quite some time.  Who are the Oceanic 6, what happened to the rest of the survivors of 815, how did the 6 escape the island, and who the hell is in the damn coffin!?!?! These were just a few of the questions posed (and answered, thankfully) in the fourth season.      The fourth season also includes some of the finest episodes and acting of the entire series.  \\"The Constant\\" is 40 of the most emotionally gripping minutes of television you will ever see.  Henry Ian Cusick continues to make Desmond one of the more lovable and let's be honest, coolest characters on television.  In addition, Terry O' Quinn continues with the John Locke character where he was left off at the end of season 1.  That is as the most mysterious and captivating characters on television.  And of course, we can't mention John Locke without mentioning Benjamin Linus.  Mr. Michael Emerson does the impossible in this season.  He makes you actually feel bad for Benjamin Linus.  I challenge any other actor to do that.      Well, I could go on and on.  I'll try to wrap this up by saying that save for one or two episodes like \\"Eggtown\\" and the eagerly awaited yet terribly disappointing  \\"Meet Kevin Johnson\\", this is a near perfect season from start to finish.  Even those episodes are far beyond worth watching.  So what are you waiting for?  Catch up, it's almost January!

1400082773|5.0|Published in 1995, long before Barack Obama could have even conceived of running for president, this coming-of-age memoir brilliantly reflects the confusion of having mixed race parents and of being a \\"black\\" man in today's America. It also finely tells the story of a boy and then a man and his elusive delusions about his missing father. Finally tracking down his heritage and the truth, through Kansas, then Hawaii, and then Kenya, Obama spins an insightful and authentic tale about losing and then finding himself through his father. This tale of the son seeking his father is an ancient one, and Barack does it justice here. He transcends race, and embraces his fragmented past in order to make himself as whole as he can be.<br /><br />This is a literary work. Its metaphors and descriptions are well thought out and satisfying to read. It bears contrast with James Baldwin's \\"Go Tell It On the Mountain\\" and James McBride's \\"The Color of Water.\\" Read it, and be amazed that we have this thoughtful, brilliant, introspective, self-aware person as our president. What a miracle!
B000002ADT|5.0|Owned this labum for more than 10 years, I love Coltrane (not all), I love Miles (not all), and many others (I recommend Abdullah Ibrahim), but this one is the quintessence, the one I ALWAYS go back to. I just don't grow weary. If I were to take one album on desert island, that would be Kind of Blue.
B00006JIA4|4.0|THIS IS A GREAT PACKAGE BUT WHEN I PUT IT INTO ITUNES THE TITLES WERE ALL WRONG ON THE SECOND DISC, THEY CAME UP WITH THE SAME TITLES AS THE FRIST DISC
0756404746|5.0|Outstanding book and great to have a new fantasy author, if you are salivating for A Dance with Dragons and you can't stand Christopher Paolini or Terry Goodkind. The Name of the Wind is a great read and you will love Kvothe.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Gone now are those marvelous guitar solos, charged with energy yet seemingly effortlessly controlled as, for instance, the Basel live version of \\"Sultans of Swing\\". But still very apparent in this CD is the ability to tell a story in a song and to express emotion on the guitar. Knopfler has moved on, and although the youthful energy is no longer there, his art has not diminished, and that puts him in another league from any other musician that I know.<br /><br />The quality of the music is toned down but still very apparent. Some of the story songs are certainly by comparison to his classic stuff a bit quaint - like \\"The Scaffolder's Wife\\" and \\"Secondary Waltz\\" - and they are not the stuff that invites listening over and over again. But they are well done and not just throwaways, although perhaps they require the listener to be beyond a certain age.<br /><br />The rest of the CD has a lot more understatement and more staying power. Songs such as \\"Behind with the Rent\\" and \\"In the Sky\\"  are gems that are beautifully done. As a whole the lyrics are subtle and clever. The guitar says much in a quiet way.
B001GQACGO|3.0|It appears that another artist has fallen victim to the drastic call for change.  Maybe the term \\"victim\\" is a tad-bit drastic, but it appears that artists such as Beyonce, John Legend, Usher, and others are not just growing, but they are broadcasting loudly that they aren't the same artists that they were last week, last month, or even last album and we, the consumer, will have to take it or leave it.  In my opinion, this is comparable to McDonalds getting everyone hooked on burgers and fries, but then switching up formats and saying that their passion really is fine vegetarian cuisine.    In all honestly, I'm open to change.  When Pink changed styles from her first album to her second, I was pumping my fist rock 'n' roll style.  However, there are some artists that we grow to love for a certain thing.  Beyonce is one of them.  Her uptempo stuff, for a female, is possibly some of the best and most consistent there is.  Years from now, Crazy In Love, Get me Bodied, Check Up On It, and Single Ladies will still be bringing people to the dance floor in droves.  Uptempo is her signature thing, though I must note that we do appreciate the slower stuff like Irreplaceable. However, any female artist could have done it--and I think Rihanna did with Take A Bow.    With her latest effort, Beyonce is not just showing us that she has grown, she's forcing it down our throats.  With the exception of Single Ladies, the one or two other tracks that I like, such as Ego and Sweet Dreams, out of the 19 or 20 had to grow on me.  I'm not used to that from Beyonce.  Though I now tolerate If I Were a Boy, with the exception of that, the other 8 or so slow songs seem to be variations of the same song and I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to listen to them through-and-through.  Though I'm happy that she is growing as an artists, 10 slow songs on a disc is just not what I want from Beyonce.  And let's not just call the songs slow because there are some classic slow R&B songs, but these are like a merge of R&B & contemporary, or classical or some other uninspiring genre packaged and marketed to people in there teens, twenties and thirties.  It simply misses the mark.    The uptempo stuff does give Beyonce fans a little of what they want, but even this has her stamp of \\"I've changed\\" written all over it.  My fear is that with the release of the first two singles, we've heard the best this album has to offer.  Unless she repackages it, there will probably be no further hugely successful singles, and after the first week or so, the album fully ladden with all it's change will change from being on the top spot to falling right off the charts like Usher's did.  Though she may get a few award nominations in categories that she'd previously not been eligible for because of the slower more contemporary stuff, the majority of her true fans will probably be disappointed.

B001DSNF8C|5.0|Plenty of action, beautiful women, and a great script once again thrill us to the core!  The Blue-ray version is spectacular in all aspects.  Add it to your must have list! It's a five star ride you'll enjoy over and over.
B000AP04MO|5.0|Such a classic -- the Simpsons honored it with a parody (11/9/2008's \\"Dangerous Curves\\")!  Hepburn was never lovelier, and Finney was a fine figure of a man in this vignette-filled study of a romance/marriage. Set in Europe, using the device of various road-trips, \\"Two..\\" shows the ups, downs, and d&eacute;ja-vus of a 10-year relationship. Sure, some of it seems dated, but its heart rings true.  (Don't miss the wacky couple Eleanor Bron/William Daniels as \\"ugly Americans,\\" or the early scene with the young, not-in-the-opening-credits Jacqueline Bisset.) It's a rocky road to love, but it's a great trip in their cars. Not to be missed!
B001F7MSF2|4.0|This is a great movie with plenty of action, and attention to detail.  THe Blue-ray version is incredible, showcasing the sharpness of the movie shooting sets as well as the characters.  Also, the extras are super, especially the tour of the movie sets. The collector's set is a fan must have!
B00006AUIG|5.0|It's been a long time since I saw a horror movie that made sense, wasn't slasher or torture focused, and really scared me. This movie really did. I won't rehash the plot, it's already been done. I do think that people who think that Simon was an actual demon (like I do), rather than a psychological state, found this movie scarier, but they still liked it. I watched it with a friend and we came away with totally diffrent conclusions, but we both loved it. Get it today!
B001GQO50I|1.0|Jeff Jampol and the Doors Management, as well as whoever else at Elektra Records and Warner Music Group, have done a shameful thing by releasing this subpar quality CD. While the original masters were safely in the hands of the original owner for all these years, The Doors and their management never even attempted to contact him to work out some agreement for the usage of the tapes.    Don't support a greedy management that has no respect for those who were actually responsible for preserving such historical musical performances!!!
0393312836|5.0|This sentence from the second-to-last chapter of our modern Dante's journey through Hell sums up this book in many ways. Intellectually stimulating, violent, fun, beautiful, dark and open; you won't find a better dystopia.<br /><br />The problems I tend to have with dark novels about possible futures are that the authors tend to be extremely proud of themselves, and this smugness can ruin a book--and also that the changes in society often seem too clever or silly for me to actually enjoy the story.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange, however, pleases the ear as much as it does the mind. Maybe this is because most of Burgess' new words are actually words stolen from other languages. Whatever the reason, this counter-culture comes off as eminently plausible; and one that embraces violence without condemning it is a refreshing change from all these didactic novels about the \\"dangers\\" of the nature of humanity.
B000W1V7K4|3.0|I enjoyed this movie in theatres and decided to buy it on Bluray since it was a very visually appealing movie. Well let me tell you, don't spend the extra money on Bluray, just buy the DVD if you like this movie. I borrowed my friends DVD to see the difference after I was very unsatisfied with my Bluray and the quality is almost identical. If you're into High-def movies like me, this isn't one to get. Spend half the money and get the same picture quality.
0143038583|4.0|As a teacher and omnivorous reader, I evaluate books in terms of \\"is this something I wish students would read?\\" (or- is the time invested worth the knowledge gained?) This one earns a qualified \\"yes\\". The qualifier is simply that many of them wouldn't read a non-fiction book of this length without a weapon pointed to their heads. But the combination of easy to understand science and personal example is exactly what can encourage students to begin learning outside of the standards-based curriculum that has come to rule education today.                Aside from all that, why do I like this book? My mom was the original \\"eat your vegetables\\" mom. Every dinner, she said, should have at least two vegetables; one green. We lived far from the urban centers, so local produce was easy to find. I early on noticed the difference between my grandfather's tomatoes and those from the supermarket.Then I lived in New Orleans where the Whole Foods Coop was walking distance from my apartment. When I became a mom, I used a little grinder to prepare my own baby food.       Time marches on. Now I work full time outside of the house, and am happy with myself if I manage one fruit and two veggies in a whole day to offer to the kids. But I still care about what we eat, and wish we had more viable options to our perfectly beautiful supermarket food, which I suspect to be less than \\"wholesome\\".       Maybe with education, we can create more demand, and give more people the option to choose healthier food, and support small scale sustainable farming. I think this book a valuable contribution to that goal.
0316743003|5.0|Living near the Nest of Stealths, I had a great interest in who created this plane. Many books came out about the planes, and uses in the Gulf War and Panama... but none on the engineers and managers...until Mr. Rich decided to write a book.  While the entire book is not dedicated entirely to the F-117, it was interesting enough to pick up and read. There were many areas I had never considered stealth technology would be useful - heck, a stealth ship (the Sea Shadow)?? Whodathunk?<br /><br />Mr. Rich was the protege of an amazing engineer (Kelly Johnson), and an outstanding one in his own right. His amazing story, and those of the projects he built, are intertwined inside the fabric of national defense. Wanna know where Lockheed Skunk Works got the idea for stealth? Read the book.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|Something changed for Dido on this album. She had nothing left to prove to anyone but herself. 5 years can make you grow so much. Losing a lover, a father. All I can say is, when I first heard, \\" Don't Believe In Love,\\" I thought what the heck. This is not the Dido I knew. Yet, that is exactly what is so great about this album . Dido takes a chance. True fans will let this music grown on you, and realize how much effort was put into this piece of art.    My Favorites:    Don't Believe In Love  Never Want To Say It's Love  Grafton Street  Look No Further  Us 2 Little Gods  The Day Before The Day  Northern Skies  For One Day    Thank you Dido for not being a sellout, and redefining what a true artist means. Grammy Award winner, hopefully!
0743497465|1.0|Dan Brown has some wonderful books.  This is not one of them.  I picked this up, due to my interest in U.S. government agencies (three letter ones), and the space program. I should have put the book back down instead of buying it.<br /><br />While I don't begrudge Mr. Brown his conspiracies, I would recommend do some better research on *what* the agencies actually do, than assume.  I'm sure, after I write this, the NRO will send their \\"hit-squad\\" after me. Or not.<br /><br />The two main characters were decently written, action was enough to keep me reading, and the premise (while flawed) had some taste of \\"within the realm of cocaine-addled possibility... but using a Three Letter Agency (TLA) as the harbingers of death because a satellite program was jacked up... What?!?  The U.S. govt has lost *billions* of dollars to satellite programs that don't work, break down immediately after launch or blow up on the launch pad. You don't see people dying en masse because of THOSE screw ups.<br /><br />I'm a TLA purist - I do studies on the Intelligence Community and their agencies... I could even believe that the CIA has kidnapped Roswell aliens in their Langley facility... but to think the NRO (made up of lazy Air Force bluesuiters and pencil-pushing CIA geeks) could conjure up a convincing conspiracy TOGETHER... now that's definitely fiction.  Save your dollars for the Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, or a coloring book. Put \\"Deception Point\\" back on the shelf.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Well, I caught the Lady G's videos online and loved her energy, 'tude and beats. Used Zune Pass to sample the album ... and love it! Comparisons to Madonna's Hard Candy abound and I have to admit - I give the edge to Lady GaGa. This album is hot - danceable, urban, edgey, fresh. Keep it banging, girlfriend!
B001BGTWXI|3.0|All Hope is Gone starts out much the same as the other Slipknot albums.  They build you up with an intro track and you lose your mind on the first song.  All is certainly good there.<br /><br />After that, Slipknot attempts to evolve into a band that should be called, Slip-Sour.<br /><br />Instead of keeping up the pace with the blistering, opening track, \\"Gematria (The Killing Name)\\", they go into a mid-tempo, radio-friendly rocker.  Granted, there is always some of that on their albums and often they are good songs.  \\"Sulfur\\" IS a good song.  Unfortunately, it isn't even the most commercial song on here by any stretch.<br /><br />The hardest aspect to deal with is that Corey sings WAY too much on this album.  If I wanted the Stone Sour singer, I'd buy Stone Sour albums.  Pretty much every song on this album has Corey using his singing voice to some degree.  Yuck.  He has a good singing voice, but in Slipknot, it is best when used in moderation.<br /><br />Even though I am entirely bothered by Corey's vocal direction on this CD, I think this album is really good up thru Track 5 (\\"Dead Memories\\").  After that, the album becomes rather underwhelming with nothing standing out as being catchy or interesting (sans \\"All Hope Is Gone\\").<br /><br />Let's take a song like \\"Snuff\\".  It's not actually a bad song, but it belongs on a Stone Sour record -- NOT a Slipknot album.  What maggot want's a weepy ballad on their Slipknot album??  Go 'mature' on someone else's dime and stop wasting real Slipknot fans' time and money.<br /><br />I think this album is ideal for those who mostly prefer Slipknot's singles, who likes Stone Sour and/or thinks that Volume 3 was the best Slipknot album up until this point.  If any of that describes you, you'll be happy with this album.<br /><br />If you are a long-time maggot who thinks that Slipknot and Iowa were the best Slipknot material, you might not be too happy with All Hope Is Gone.  This album certainly wasn't made with those fans in mind.  This was clearly an attempt to please critics and casual fans -- and I'm not even sure that they will ultimately accomplish that.asual fans -- and I'm not even sure that they will ultimately accomplish that.

0553382179|5.0|It is not too much to say that this book (and the author's associated website) changed my life.  I read it four years ago and still consult it on an irregular basis.  Marla Cilley teaches us not only how to get our homes in order (and this in itself is no mean task; I used to be traumatised by my house, because of my 'perfect' homemaker mother who made me feel inadequate) but also, strangely, how to get peace into our lives.  All this is explained in simple babysteps and a lovely, chatty, no-nonsense tone of voice.  Above all, Marla Cilley has been there and done it, and she really understands us women struggling with house, kids, career, life.  There is no hype here and no pretense at having the key to solving it all, just simple steps and routines.  I implemented most things straight away and although my house is far from 'perfect' (which, in the author's mind, is a good thing!  read and find out why), everything is so much more in order than it was.  I recommend this book with all my heart.    Nina, university lecturer in Cambridge, UK
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is an excellent DVD to keep. The movie is excellent and the first disc in and of itself is worth the price. Not sure if the second disc with the special features are all that great unless you like seeing the old Bond girls. Still, a great dvd set with a great price!

Then there is EVE  which is Eve in the bible and the axiom is the ark, ant the robots are noah and te humans are the animals (no offense) What I am saying is that ever scene has a porpose Pixar does not make movies just for fun tey make porposes like for The Incredibles that meaning is to stick wit hyour family and don't separate.See what i mean.

B001CZVVXW|5.0|This is my first exposure to opera on blu-ray. What a great introduction. The audio and video are simply stunning and the cast is outstanding. I cannot wait to see what is coming in the future. For all those who argue endlessly about blu-ray versus upconverted dvds, stop wasting your time and enjoy the latest advancement in home theater.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E lives up to the hype I heard about it.  The storyline is excellent.  This little, yet extremely durable, robot really has some character about him.  When a new robot lands on the earth, Wall-E finds someone to share his lonely world...Lucky for Wall-E it was a female robot.  Lucky for the viewers too, I guess.  The two end up on a wild adventure out in space with some out of shape humans and robots in need of repair.<br /><br />The comedy in Wall-E is great fun and a joy to watch unfold on the screen.  Pixar almost always seems to deliver a great product.  Wall-E is no exception.  Buy this movie, pop some popcorn, and sit back and enjoy a work of art!<br /><br />May God bless!<br />See ya next review!<br /><br />[[ASIN:1414100574 The Running Girl]]
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|I never could stand ABBA even when they were popular, Dancing Queen made my skin crawl. I had no plans or desire to see the show. When a friend wanted to see it in Las Vegas I considered it a huge waste of time and money ($110 seats) but went along to be polite.   It was magic. I've been back since and will go again before it closes there in Jan '09. I cannot say enough good things about the Vegas stage show.  For the movie... they take the story line and ruin it. The whole point is a cast of six adult leads who are jaded by the choices they've made,  everyone else is young, vital and searching for the most they can find in their bright shiny new lives. All is demonstrated through constant action and singing.  Lead role Donna (streep) should be early 40's in age. They picked Streep and turned it into a senior moment. She can't solve a 20 year age discrepancy. Then they have to surround her with senior friends, one of whom couldn't carry a tune in a bucket (Brosnan), he tries so hard it's painful. Even the movie supporting cast are villagers (mostly old ones disconnected from the plot) instead of the young locals in the stage show, who work at the taverna Donna runs.  I'm not young and I tire of the constant need to feature youth as the epitomy of life, but in this case the story demands it. The stage show features youth and vitality because it's central to the theme of the story (not to mention 90 mins of dancing). One would expect the long shooting scedule of a movie to allow better casting, not worse. Clearly they went for names in the movie, without regard to the plot.  The ultimate scene in the play is on a beach, cast members dancing in costumes that are so over the top it's hilarious. In the movie it becomes about 5 seconds of dancing on a dock sans costumes. Deflating at best.  Same for the flashback scene when the 3 female leads reprise singing in their old band - the costumes make the moment. In the movie the costumes are totally different, and dull.   If you haven't seen the show, see the movie first. If you've seen the show, borrow this from the library, don't waste your money.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I always planned to see Rent (the stage version) I pass the Nederlander Theatre ALL THE TIME. I just didn't do it. When the movie came out I planned to go to and see it. (I didn't)<br /><br />One I was stuck in bed with a badly sprained ankle & I ound a website where you can watch entire movies for free online. I found myself thinking of what movies I wanted to see but hadn't, I thought of Rent and pleased when the search engine had found it. I realized then that I wanted to see it for 3 years, I didn't even realize it had been out that long.<br /><br />Anyways I watched it & was blown away.<br /><br />I was going to wait until the holidays and ask for it as a gift, but the message of Rent had already sunk in too deep & was tired of waiting for tomorrow - NO DAY BUT TODAY right? The first day I was back on my feet I went out & purchased the 2-disc DVD & the soundtrack.<br /><br />I have been listening to the soundtrack ever since & I have watched the movie at least 3 times a week since I bought it.<br /><br />It is either a love or hate thing. None of my friends get it, but that's okay, it means something to me. It has changed my whole perception on life and what's important.<br /><br />It's a great movie & the music is incredible. Jonathan Larson made something real. His effort causes me to question my own motives and my own abilities. Just what could I contribute if I put today first?
B001LRICM4|3.0|Oh, boy. I love this show, and I had trouble respecting this episode.<br /><br />It's a disjointed, quickly-thrown-together, crappy episode. It hurts to say that about one of my favorite shows, but there you go.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1) the Ruby character--oy. Where to begin. Will she ever really be more than a prop? I don't know. But she isn't more than a prop in this episode. She feeds  Sam some lines that help shape later bits in the episode, but otherwise, she does a lot of screaming and bleeding and not much else.<br />2) Castiel and Uriel--they are wasted here (although Castiel actually is a plus in some ways--see below). They come for Anna, ostensibly to kill her, and they of course encounter resistance from the menfolk, who just don't get that these angels aren't all warm and cuddly and. . .well, angelic. No, they have a mission, and sometimes the stuff they gotta do is horrible. Why is this surprising to the Winchester men? I dunno. Anyway, these two angels get short shrift here, and it's annoying that Castiel, in particular, gets used that way. Also--what's up with the whole Alastair-can't-be-killed thing? Does that mean he's better than an angel of the Lord, or what? Utter confusion. So--these guys get used in the plot line, and all that happens as a result is that the viewer gets utterly confused. Perfect.<br />3) The whole plot line is convoluted and filled with happenings that don't make much sense. Pamela comes back to help Anna figure out what's really in her head that she can't remember, but that comes from left field. And almost everything that happens here seems disconnected. Maybe it's that so much is left kind of unexplained, and the show won't be on again until January, so eh? I'm confused, unsatisfied, and basically left to be so for another two months. Fantastic.<br /><br />Good stuff:<br />1) Jensen Ackles. He's been kicking acting butt for two years or more now, and he just gets better and better. This guy knows how to make Dean vulnerable, and his willingness to just put Dean Winchester out there and let him be human and flawed and in deep, deep pain, with all the acting challenges that comes with--well, kudos to you, Jensen Ackles. You are superb. From the way your face can show childlike glee (think the \\"Mystery Spot\\" episode) to the way your eyes can actually go blurry and your face seem to crumple in on itself from guilt and self-loathing. Oh, yeah. The last scene in this episode is a perfect example of what I mean. Every muscle twitch, the way you refuse to stop those tears--a long time coming, they are--to just overflow, and the way every single emotion is just. . .THERE. Awesome. Someone give this man an Emmy.<br />2) Castiel--like Jensen Ackles, Misha. . .what's his last name? Huh. Can't remember. Anyway, the guy who plays Castiel. He can convey so much with just a subtle shift in expression. At one point, when Anna realizes that Dean has given her up to Uriel and Castiel in order to save Sam from death or a quick toss into the pit of Hell, she turns to Dean and tells him she understands and forgives him. The camera pans to Castiel a couple of times, and the longing in his eyes (for the human emotions that angels aren't supposed to feel or enjoy having) as well as the respect he has for Dean and the decisions he makes at risk of his own sanity and happiness--all there on this guy's face and in his eyes. Good job here, too.<br /><br />Those are the only two positives I can see in this episode, but they were enough to keep me from giving it one or two stars.<br /><br />Hopefully the new episodes in January will return with the quality of the first four or so of this season.<br /><br />Again--someone give Mr. Ackles an Emmy or a People's Choice or something.

B000FQJAIW|4.0|Star Wars 4 Limited Edition includes the original theatrical release and the 2004 tweaked version.  There are some fans who refuse to watch the 2004 edition. They prefer the original version where Han shoots first.  Then there are people who prefer the 2004 release because it looks more realistic and updated.  This DVD will please both fans.   The only reason this DVD does not get five stars is the lack of special features.  There are no deleted scenes or inside looks. It just includes commentary.   If you already own the 2004 DVD, it is up to you if you want to spend 15 dollars on the original.  You might want to wait for the Absolute Blu Ray Star Wars Episode 1-6 set becasue it will probably be made.       Note: For those of you with widescreen tvs, you will have to zoom in on the original disc because it is non-anaphormic. No biggy.

B000VS6R26|5.0|This was a great movie to see in the theater, which is not a typical thing for me to say, and so it is even better in your own home (although the 61\\" telly helps), where you can pause it and get up to go to the loo. But it was every bit as amazing and moving and incredible to watch. And even though I knew the end of the film, I was still on the edge of my seat as the ship went to her watery grave. An amazing experience for all ages!

0375500901|4.0|Gabriel Allon is, arguably, one of the most fascinating characters devised in works of espionage and this was the initial book in the ongoing series. As with all of the stoties by the writer, the characters are richly developed and the plot is a very complex one with numerous turns existing. The witer is able to handle numerous plotlines in different parts of the world in a most skillful manner. One is able to visualize the characters as real people and empathize with their reasons for reacting as they do. Perhaps the most significant issue raised by the writer deals with the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. He is able to verbalize the deep passion that exists on both sides and presents this as a reason that causes problems in a resolution ever coming to the fore.  This is a superbly well done book that is a rapid read and that will give the reader meaningful insight as the existing Conflict. Perhaps the only area of weakness concerns the manner in which the writer brings his book to a close. It was a  bit too pat for my liking although it did not detract from enjoying his work.

B001GQO50I|1.0|EDIT: UPDATE: Sept 12, 2009 - The Doors purchased the complete Matrix Master tapes from original location engineer Peter Abram circa April of 2009.  Doors manager Jeff Jampol recently posted on the Doors Message Board that the band will issue a complete Matrix Box Set in Q1 or Q2 of 2010.  This upcoming official Matrix box set will include 2 previously unheard instrumental jams recorded on March 7, 1967.  If you are considering buy this CD, it is recommended you wait until 2010 and buy the complete box set which will mark the first time the original master tapes have been used.    -------------------------------------------------    The Doors and Warner Music Group issued a press release to promote this CD, stating: \\"Restored and carefully mastered from first generation tapes acquired by Elektra Records and The Doors 40 years ago, these historic shows never sounded better.\\"    However, at least 4 tracks here were sourced from 3rd generation or higher bootlegs.  The remaining songs were mastered from an edited 2nd generation 1/4\\" reel to reel copy of a cassette dub made from the master reels.    Neither the Doors, nor their corporate record label Warner Music Group (aka the Rhino and Elektra imprints) own the original master recordings.    The master tapes are owned by Peter Abram, who had the foresight to record the band at The Matrix (with the band's permission)--more than two years before Elektra and Paul Rothchild got around to recording The Doors in a live setting at The Aquarius theater in 1969.    These legendary 1967 live tapes were well engineered by the young Abram and find the rock band at the peak of their prowess as an improvisatory unit.    However, the tapes Warner Music Group has published on this 2 CD rip off are vastly inferior to the master tapes, brief samples of which are circulating on the Internet with Peter's permission for comparison purposes.    Some fans may choose to believe that Abram is being greedy by asking for cash for his tapes.  However, The Doors manager Jeff Jampool has publicly stated the Doors' policy about acquiring live tapes is that they will only provide a small royalty based on sales.    According to Abram, he wasn't even approached to sell his tapes to the Doors for this release.  And what about all those bootlegs on the market?  According to Abram, all bootlegs derive from the missing first generation cassette copies in the Doors archive, which vanished in the 1970s.    The fans get a sonically subpar, incomplete product.  The legality of this release is suspect since Peter owns the master tapes.  Peter Abram receives zero money from  this product, even though he owns the master sound recording.  Meanwhile, your purchase of this material will make Warner Music Group and The Doors a little bit wealthier.    And this is the same rock band that recently sued itself for $5million dollars over issues of \\"integrity.\\"    By the way, how much money was cover designer Stanley Mouse paid for his Matrix album cover art, while they guy that actually recorded the show--on his own nickel and made this cash cow possible for The Doors--doesn't even receive a credit as recording engineer in the liner notes?
B001H5X7KC|4.0|This movie certainly is not for everyone.  It starts out very promising with some very funny \\"fake\\" trailers.  Then the squirming begins.  This movie funny, but it isn't a laugh out loud, tears streaming down your face funny.  It's more of a \\"Oh my gosh, I can't believe they just did that\\" snicker.  You almost feel bad for watching it because you will find things humorous that you somehow feel you shouldn't, but you will smile anyways.  I personally found it to be entertaining and I bought the Blu-Ray even after seeing it in theaters so it wasn't a blind buy.  It's one of those movies that I will enjoy watching with others just to see how they react.  For most people, I would say this is a rental unless you catch a good deal, but you should make the effort to see it.  The performances are great and this has become only the second movie that I have enjoyed Robert Downey Jr in, with Iron Man being the first.  Jack Black was the only character that I really didn't like for most of the movie.  I just wanted to watch him in \\"The Fatties\\" which is his characters money maker.  Anyways, again, it's a solid rental, but if your thing is comedy, action and a lot of uncomfortableness, then go ahead and buy it.  It looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray and you might end up liking it like me.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian gets an amazing workout in for 20 minutes. Even Level 1 would be tough for most people. If you workout regularly you'll still struggle but will probably move up to Level 2 fairly quickly. By the time you work your way up to Level 3, you have plenty of strength. The other Jillian videos aren't as good. I recommend this video to anybody.

B001AMVN3U|3.0|In an effort to bring my music collection toward some level of legitimacy i purchased this album instead of downloading it.  Mistake.  The Music is excellent (*****), but it is encoded 256VBR w/a NON-LAME encoder.  For the un-initiated, they used a third party poor quality encoder that cuts off most frequencies above 16khz.  A proper LAME encoder would have kept all frequencies at least until 19khz.  Next time i will download the uncompressed FLAC encoding via BitTorrent.<br /><br />note: Amazon MP3 Downloads seem to vary; some have been encoded properly, just not this one.

031606792X|5.0|I loved all the Twilight books. Before I got to book 3 and 4 - by the way I was completely hooked by 1 & 2 and couldn't put them down - I read reviews where people had shared how disappointed they were by Books 3 and 4 because they weren't as good as 1 & 2. I didn't slow down though and read book 3 then 4 and was pleasantly surprised and happy I didn't listen to the reviews too much.**SPOILER** It was fun to experience Bella's world as a vampire and the series has only left me wanting more!

1580176941|5.0|I am a pretty decent cook but NOT a baker -- I have never used a piping bag before nor have I ever made icing. Under a fit of curiousity and inspiration, I bought this book a few weeks ago and LOVE it! After reading the book and purchasing some suggested supplies, I did one test run of cookies and then a few days later made leaf and pumpkin cookies for my daughter's entire class. They loved them and they looked fabulous. The authors make cookie making and decorating as simple or complex as you would like for it to be. My designs looked a lot more complex than they were, thanks to the authors of this book who made it easy to get started. Couldn't recommend a better book for beginners, and the more complex designs (like a standing cookie sled centerpiece!) will challenge and inspire those who have been decorating for years. Since I'm a visual learner, the only negative is that I would have liked for the authors to provide a picture depecting the consistency of flood and piping icing, instead of a written description. However, I easily found pics online that answered my question.    Edit: I'm adding this comment one year later after purchasing this book. I've been decorating cookies this whole while and this book has become my cookie bible. The sugar cookie and chocolate/cocoa dough recipe in this book are the only two cookie recipes that I use. The chocolate sugar cookies taste almost like brownies. Yum! And the royal icing recipes work like a charm. I love how they give all the different recipes for icing depending upon if you use liquid eggs, powder egg whites, etc. I still find massive inspiration within these pages. I've bought several cookie books since this one, and though great for ideas, this is the only one that is my go-to for every cookie I make.
0316017922|5.0|I found this book to be totally engaging with highly entertaining discussions of success... failure... near misses... and what might have been. The author's discussions include historical figures who made it... and enigmatic figures who missed. Discussed are the required combinations of pieces needed to complete a *SUCCESSFUL-PUZZLE*... as the pieces for some people float by each other as if they are minute particles in an infinite galaxy... while other people who achieve success... are blessed with the same minute pieces of potential... that collide like a monstrous head-on collision... resulting in success.<br /><br />The material presented ranges from the shockingly high percentage of professional hockey players and baseball players whose birthdays fall within particular months of the year. And after further explanation from the author, the reader (if a sports fan) realizes that the logical explanation was right there in front of you all along. In Little League, Babe Ruth League, etc. there is a legal cutoff birth date for the maximum age of a boy to be allowed to play. (Generally July 31st) Coaches and managers when selecting their high ranking \\"travel teams\\" believe the bigger older kids are better... older by up to 364 days if their birthday is August 1st as compared to a boy born on July 31st or earlier. It's an obvious fact that at that age, a boy who is 10-12 months older than another child will be way ahead in size/intelligence/maturity compared to a boy almost one year younger. Once selected for the \\"special\\" team... the player will play up to three times as many games in a year... get better specialized coaching... better equipment... and so naturally the odds are much better that later in life, the older boy on the \\"right\\" side of the date cutoff will be a better player. If you doubt that \\"assumption\\"... how about this: \\"THERE ARE MORE PLAYERS IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES BORN IN AUGUST THAN IN ANY OTHER MONTH!\\" \\"IN 2005 AMONG AMERICANS PLAYING MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 505 WERE BORN IN AUGUST VERSUS 313 IN JULY.\\" The same truism applies to children when they first start school. There is a date cutoff that can make a 364 day difference in children. The older children learn quicker... are more mature... advanced study groups are formed... \\"GIFTED\\" students are put in special classes and the odds are the younger kids may never catch up.<br /><br />For every hard working successful person reading this book... I guarantee you one of your favorite chapters will be \\"THE 10,000-HOUR-RULE\\". Regardless of your occupation: musician/programmer/ballplayer studies show that you did not simply wake up and became a success. Varying examples are given with such wide ranging subjects as \\"THE BEATLES\\" and Bill Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems. This book will keep your interest with a kaleidoscope like array of fascinating subjects including: A LIST OF THE SEVENTY-FIVE RICHEST PEOPLE IN *HUMAN-HISTORY* and the common connecting outlier... an American with an IQ of *TWO-HUNDRED* (Note: Einstein's IQ was ONE-HUNDRED-FIFTY.)... Key moments in Bill Gates life (Note: He is \\"not\\" one of the seventy-five richest people in human history.)...<br /><br />There is deliciously interesting biographical information on geniuses such as \\"ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, THE PHYSICIST WHO FAMOUSLY HEADED THE AMERICAN EFFORT TO DEVELOP THE NUCLEAR BOMB DURING WORLD WAR II. OPPENHEIMER, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, WAS A CHILD WITH A MIND VERY MUCH LIKE CHRIS LANGAN'S (The aforementioned American with a TWO-HUNDRED-IQ.) HIS PARENTS CONSIDERED HIM A GENIUS. ONE OF HIS TEACHERS RECALLED THAT \\"HE RECEIVED EVERY NEW IDEA AS PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL.\\" HE WAS DOING LAB EXPERIMENTS IN THE THIRD GRADE AND STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY BY THE FIFTH GRADE. WHEN HE WAS NINE, HE ONCE TOLD ONE OF HIS COUSINS, \\"ASK ME A QUESTION IN LATIN AND I WILL ANSWER YOU IN GREEK.\\" OPPENHEIMER WENT TO HARVARD AND THEN ON TO CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY TO PURSUE A DOCTORATE IN PHYSICS.\\" HE STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION HIS ENTIRE LIFE... HE TOOK SOME CHEMICALS FROM THE LABORATORY AND TRIED TO POISON HIS TUTOR.\\"<br /><br />One very important thing you will learn through these stories of intellect... success... near misses... and what could have been... is that *NO-ONE- EVER-MAKES-IT-ALONE!\\" This is a non-stop-engrossing well written book. I recommend it highly.E TOOK SOME CHEMICALS FROM THE LABORATORY AND TRIED TO POISON HIS TUTOR.\\"    One very important thing you will learn through these stories of intellect... success... near misses... and what could have been... is that *NO-ONE- EVER-MAKES-IT-ALONE!\\" This is a non-stop-engrossing well written book.

B001GQACGO|2.0|So Beyonce finally released her new album, \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\".  The problem is that there aren't enough \\"fierce\\" songs.  The only song that I initially loved from the get-go was Single Ladies (Put A ring on it).  If I were a boy, ego, sweet dreams (beautiful nightmare), video phone, grew on me.  i had to force myself into liking diva, disappear, and thats why your beautiful, and the rest of the songs suck.  i think beyonce is trying too hard to do something different, and she should go back to what made her a pop star (crazy in love, baby boy, irreplaceable, freakum dress, green light, me myself and i, naughty girl, ring the alarm, suga mama, etc. etc.).  i am one of the BIGGEST beyonce fans, but i will have to be honest and say that this album is probably my LEAST favorite from her.  my favorite would have to be B-DAY.  she said on BET that this is definitely NOT her last album and there will be 'many more to come' so hopefully the next time around, she learns from her mistakes and goes back to what we all started liking her for in the first place (uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-no-no)!

014240876X|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.<br /><br />But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.<br /><br />Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.<br /><br />But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.<br /><br />Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave.will come alive, and never quite leave.
B001GQSY64|3.0|The August 2008 release is set between Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. It is a stand-alone story and - crucially - was designed as an introduction to a weekly animated TV series of the same name.<br /><br />The animation-style has the look of Japanese anime and manga, while giving a nod to the supermarionation of the classic British 1960s series, Thunderbirds. The fight scenes are visually stunning in this presentation, though the dialogue to push the story forward often suffers from being quite stilted.<br /><br />What makes for a successful TV series does not necessarily translate to the large screen (the reverse is also true).  While obviously aimed at younger audiences and as a marketing tool, it does not set the foundation to propel this Star Wars universe concept into a remarkable movie franchise.

I remember the day i saw the video for \\"How You Remind Me\\", and I instantly fell in love with this band.  Chad has one of the greatest vocals in the history of hard rock;and his guitar skills prove that he's God in comparison to over rated guitarist of the past.<br /><br />This CD demonstrates their ability to make another superb album, regardless of what negative critics say. 5 stars is not enough for this band or album.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|The movie Wall-E is a great movie!  However, the DVD \\"special edition\\" (non-blue-ray) does not contain a DTS audio track that is common in other special editions.  Disney did however include a DTS-HD track on the blue-ray regular and special editions.  Amazon also covers this up by vaguely referring to the specifications of the both the blue-ray version and the regular dvd edition.  Additionally, Disney also left off the disney home theater audio track that accompanies other special editions... this must be so that Disney can re-release Wall-E in the future... with a \\"Specialer\\" Special Edition...  brilliant marketing Disney!
B001GQO50I|1.0|This CD is such a mess one hardly knows where to start!    The reason why I am giving this product a bad review is simply because it is NOT what it says it is. This CD is NOT first generation tapes acquired by The Doors.    This CD is just a cleaned-up-in-the-studio copy of the tape from which all the Matrix bootlegs come from, plus some tracks lifted straight off the actual bootlegs. The hiss levels vary dramatically from one track to the next, exposing the fact that this is just a collection of different sub-par sources.     The fact that The Doors and their management lie to their fans like this is a real disgrace, and shame on them for advertising this CD as quality \\"first generation\\" product when IT IS NOT. It is just a rip-off, plain and simple.    This material has been out there for years. Don't waste your money on an incomplete, out-of-sequence copy of a bootleg.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|I never thought the day would come that another Pixar movie would come along and surpass Toy Story...but Wall-E does it!  This is a total masterpiece of film making.  From the breathtaking CGI to the amazing story, this movie is by far and away the BEST Pixar has to offer.  The story is just so moving that I get chills every time I watch it!      The message is clearly one of warning to humans about wasting our precious natural resources, recycling and global warming but that message is SO important for our children to hear.  I for one will make sure my daughter understands the true meaning of this film yet also just enjoys it for the pure innocence and love that spills from it.    This is the BEST FILM OF 2008...if you don't add this to your collection then you are not human or truly \\"alive\\".  THANK YOU PIXAR!!!!!!

Really hope they make a 2nd one before Avengers comes out. If you want a decent Blu-Ray then here it is get it! I have absolutely no complaints with this Blu-Ray and the fact its 2 Discs is even better.

B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood is based on the life and work of Edward D. Wood Jr, who has been perhaps both saddled and blessed with the title of Worst Director of All Time.  Filmed entirely in black and white it both mirrors Wood's own work and draws humor from it.  The result is one of my favorite films of all time.<br />The first time I watched it I spent most of the movie laughing at everything from the bad props, to the poor scripts, to Depp's even-more-optomistic-then-Spongebob portrayal of Wood, but with subsequent viewings I have come to see the sadder side of the story; Wood's failure to find success and stardom, Legosi's fall from grace and struggles with drug addiction, and the rag tag band of partners that would all share their exploits. It tells the tale of all those left in Hollywood's dustbin.<br />Burton splits that finest hair between tragedy and comedy in a manner that is somehow both satirical and loving.  In the end either way, it always brings tears to my eyes; sometimes they're tears of laughter, sometimes they're ones of sympathy.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|The first thing I am curious about is the '9 December' release date for Lost 4... I walked into our local CD/DVD store the weekend before last and found it in the new release section. And no, it is not a bootleg of some sort. My wife and I had not watched Season 4, as it airs on pricey satelite tv here, and we waited patiently for the DVD box. We ended up ploughing through all of it (special features included) by Monday evening.    If I have one criticism it is that the season seemed quite short.    The filming is superb (It must be simply stunning to watch on a Blu Ray system) and as always, had us on the cliched edge of our seat..... Now we have to wait (im)patiently for Season 5...
B00008AWOG|5.0|I have owned the original 2 channel CD since 2006. I own most of Opeth's releases and this is my favorite release from them. It is one of the most interesting and complex albums ever created for 4 pieces. This CD is also one of the cleanest and clearest you will ever hear, as well. This is 4 very talented musicians at, perhaps the top of their game. If you like Dream Theater, Queensryche, Tony MacAlpine, Yngwie Malmsteen or Rush you need to listen to this band. What really amazes everyone is not just their ability to go from brutally heavy to acoustic folk with a large amount of prog and jazz tossed in, but the intricacy of the songs and the dexterity of the guys. This CD rivals anything from King Crimson, Mahavishnu Orchestra or Yes, as well as the other bands mentioned above. Just to put the icing on the cake there is also tragic love story here. Have a seat and try to keep up with what they are doing here. This is one of the best Progressive Metal bands in the history of the genre.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell's third book (after The Tipping Point and Blink) has the same recipe: the author has the curiosity to study social phenomena and draw unusual conclusions. This time he tries to figure out why out-of-the-norm successful people (smart people, rich people, or even geniuses), like Bill Gates, The Beatles, Mozart or Robert Oppenheimer, get where they get.  He reckons that accidents of birth, childhood, family, culture, friendship or geography are the best indicators of a person's success. It is a blow to the great American myth of the self-made-man. But chance alone is not enough, Gladwell says, introducing also the ''law of the 10,000 hours'': the key to success in any field is simply to practice 10,000 hours of it.  Gladwell's gift is to crunch dry academic material, statistics, experiments and sociological studies and come up with accesible prose which immediately captures the popular imagination. Although the conclusion of his book is pessimistic, Outliers is an interesting book worth reading. You could read it as a manifesto for affirmative action or as a self-improvement book, but I prefer to call it pop science, excellent read for weekends and discussions with friends.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Magnifico! A most beautiful phantasy story around a 'real life' hospital  friendship of a 5 year old immigrant girl (the 'actress' is from Romania, her movie script family seems to be Bulgarian (?)) and a suicidal injured stuntman in California during silent movie times. The man tells the girl stories, which drag them both into colourful adventures all over the world and which get more and more mixed up with events in the hospital and the friends' real life. A major source of charm is the little girl Alexandria's cute immigrant English. (is not gibberish! is English!)<br />I did not expect to like the film so much; my daughter convinced me that I needed to watch it by pointing out that Darwin and Wallace have parts in it and that it is partly set in Bali.

1433502410|4.0|The ESV Study Bible contains a wealth of helpful information--perhaps too much! The notes are from an evangelical perspective and are generally even-handed. I especially appreciate the charts and colored maps that are interspersed throughout the text. For me personally, the main drawback of the ESV Study Bible is that the print size is too small for easy reading. (The print in The Reformation Study Bible [same translation] is easier on the eyes.) Much of the information in \\"Articles and Resources\\" could be published in a supplementary volume. Even though the current edition of the ESV Study Bible is somewhat hefty, I would prefer an even larger volume with larger print. I use the ESV Study Bible for reading at home--not for taking to church.

It may provide confirmation to you that your instincts on gentle and life-affirming parenting practices are right-on. But it just as likely will turn everything you have ever learned about discipline and parenting on its head.<br /><br />Try this one on for size: The \\"carrot\\" (positive reinforcement) is just as detrimental to your child's self-esteem as the \\"stick\\" (punishment). Yes, you read right. Praise is not the cure-all you have been lead to believe it is. What is important to your child's well-being is that he knows that you love him unconditionally. Which, of course, you do. But does it show through your words and actions? Your intentions are meaningless. All that matters is what your child feels.<br /><br />Children are people too. In fact, they are probably the center of your universe. So why are we encouraged to treat them as second-class? Why must they bow to their parents' every whim without so much as an explanation? This book will open your mind to the fact that children deserve and need to be respected on the same level that you expect to be as a parent.<br /><br />After all, are we not trying to raise the next generation of human beings to be compassionate and respectful of others' needs and feelings? This goal will not be accomplished by accident. We have to model the behaviors and attitudes that we want our children to learn are morally sound. If we want them to consider the effect that their actions will have on others, then this is exactly how we must act ourselves. They love and idolize their parents. Why would they not grow up to act exactly as they (we) do?<br /><br />If you are open to a new--or rather, an old, primal, instinctual--way of thinking about children and parenting, I encourage you to read [[ASIN:0982021313 Healing Our Children: Because Your New Baby Matters!

1594481938|3.0|Although I just finished the book two days ago, it took me a few minutes to remember what happens at the very end of A Long Way Down. Nick Hornby's novel begins, essentially, with its climax. Four people decide independently to go to a certain London rooftop, called Topper's House, to kill themselves on New Year's. However, as each runs into the others, the suicidal plans give way to feelings of hostile camaraderie, and the group leaves the rooftop to embark on a search through London's parties for the wayward ex-boyfriend of Jess. Thus the first section of the novel shows the characters - Martin, a disgraced morning show host; Maureen, whose son has been in a vegetative state since birth; J.J., an American whose band has recently broken up; and Jess, a maniacal and impulsive teenage girl - learning about the lives of the others and coming together to work toward a common purpose. This collaborative spirit continues after the critical night, and they decide to keep meeting up until the next most common suicide event, Valentine's Day.    Hornby tells the novel through a rotating first-person of all the characters, and although they each have a distinctive voice, his casual observer style remains audible in all. So, if you already know that you enjoy Hornby, you're probably going to get some pleasure out of A Long Way Down. I could already hear the voice-overs of the future movie of the book, if a studio could get past the whole suicide factor. However, if you've lately been cutting your teeth against more literary fare, you're likely to feel as if your time could have been better spent reading something less pat. While A Long Way Down at no point made me throw it to the ground and stamp upon it in a disappointed rage, it neither gives the trashy glee of a compelling genre novel nor the contemplative satisfaction of word art. It's fiction. It's Hornby. And you know what that means going in.

For those who don't know, a PSA.<br /><br />The work of Stevie Nicks is sublime, the alternate and live versions of her songs  make this a must have.  To hear the artistry of a young Stevie Nicks-  so many layers, such vocal genius in the ''I'm exhausted' versions of Angel and Storms- to hear each nuance in her magnificent singing makes it absolutely worth buying this set for, the McVie and Buckingham work is good to great.  YOU DON'T GET TO WATCH THE BAND at all.<br /><br />It is a bit cleverly sidestepped both in the listing here and in emails-  .  &#34;Tusk (Deluxe)(5CD/1DVD/2LP)&#34;.- Yes, Dvd 5.1 is audio, we know that- Disk 4, 'Tusk 1 Live'- Dic 5 'Disk Tusl Live 2'-  cds.  Okay.  Booklet papr quality: subjective.  NOTHING to frame or display-  know the buyer- Pink Floyd does with 2 posters and buttons-  The out-takes- live perforamces=- great-  The most nuanced Lindsey vocals are on a live 'The Chain'- the man can sing-  then you hear his ''every little bit'' embarrassingly awful vocal line readings on 'What Makes You Think'- lousy song not worth typing the title of.  $96 or so with tax- compare this package- and book- to &#34;The River'' by Springsteen-  with BLiRay DVD and multiple live FILMED performances.<br /><br />OH, amazon should change this listing  NO '10 DISK''- edition-  a mistake on this page-  it's 6 disks and 2 vinyl LPS.<br /><br />&#34; There are no two 5 song disks.&#34;  It doesn't matter-  it's just a mistake.<br />NOTHING TO WATCH-  that  sidestepped- even in the shipping email from amazon:  . You ordered &#34;Tusk (Deluxe)(5CD/1DVD/2LP)&#34;.<br /><br />Others here - my mistake- but may think 5 CD/1DVD/2LP means you get a live DVD to watch.  NO DVD to watch, no live concert on film.

0143034901|5.0|This is a wonderful novel built in a candid and poetic rithm that almost reinvents the art to tell a story. If you are that kind of people that sometimes miss old good books, this is a mordern one that for sure it will make you feel rewarded. Take your time very consciouly, after the first few chapters, I dare you are able to give it up and then...enjoy the surprising story end.

0757302661|5.0|When I became pregnant with my daughter, I knew that there must be a better way to give birth than what is typically presented by the American media. Laying on your back and being yelled at to hold your breath and push strenuously is not my idea of a peaceful, natural way to bring a child into this world. Luckily, in my exploration of only the most mainstream pregnancy websites, I happened across a description of how some women use hypnosis for natural childbirth.<br /><br />Now, if hypnosis does not sound \\"natural\\" to you, hear me out, because it didn't to me at first either. But, once I read about how the neocortex (our big modern brain) has gotten in the way of normal birthing, it made sense. Our cultural impressions and fear of birth have become engrained. Combine that with the self-consciousness and anxiety caused by laboring in a hospital, surrounded by strangers, and you have a recipe for a slow (if not completely stalled), painful birth experience.<br /><br />The Mongan Method builds on the natural childbirth movement and acknowledges that women around the world and throughout history have given birth easily and painlessly. A pain-free birth? Who wouldn't sign up for that??!! I enjoyed a peaceful and comfortable labor and birth and cannot overstate my satisfaction with Hypnobirthing.<br /><br />It is strongly advised that you read this book in conjunction with instruction by a certified Hypnobirthing childbirth instructor, which I totally agree with. My Hypnobirthing instructor was an amazing mentor to me on my road to natural parenting. If you are interested in providing your child with the best in natural parenting strategies, I also highly recommend [[ASIN:0982021313 Healing Our Children: Because Your New Baby Matters! Sacred Wisdom for Preconception, Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting (ages 0-6)]] by Ramiel Nagel.
1400097029|5.0|The story of The Sea matters less than the way it is told. Max Morden, a recent widower, takes up residence at a seaside inn that played host to a transformative summer of his childhood. Now, he spends his time drinking and reflecting upon his wife's illness and that summer long ago. Using the sea as both metaphor and setting, Banville deftly handles the universal nature of loss.     Banville writes not about but through his narrator, an art historian, and the language of The Sea reflects its protagonist's linguistic background. Every third page, I had to look up an obscure art or ocean word, such as craquelure or groyne, which would be casually tossed in as a descriptor. In fact, I eventually took to reading the novel while sitting under my laptop and an open page of dictionary.reference.com.     The prose of The Sea will draw in any reader, such as myself, who loves to linger over a poetic phrase. Many of the sentences in the novel are like sumptuous packages, and they often present the reader a depth of wisdom. Take, for example, this observation: \\"Happiness was different in childhood. It was so much then a matter simply of accumulation, of taking things -- new experiences, new emotions -- and applying them like so many polished tiles to what would someday be the marvellously finished pavilion of the self.\\"     Banville finds the fine balance between that exploration of the child and a revelation of the adult self. Occassionally reminiscent of high modernist stream-of-consciousness, The Sea considers the connection between all moments of life, with its tides and undertows of thought and understanding. I definitely recommend this quick and rewarding read and will set to diving through Banville's other works in the near future.

B001GQACGO|1.0|I used to like Beyonce. Now I have very negative feelings about her motives with this record and do not feel I could support her again.     The standard edition is garbage. I am so glad that I was able to listen before I purchased it. But you noticed how they had the standard edition and deluxe edition mixed in together for listening on the myspace page, so you don't have a clear idea as to the fact that the standard one is lacking...everything. They were blended together as if they were all one record. The only really good songs are If I Were A Boy and Halo, which she didn't even write. She stole the first one. What a joke.

That is very wrong and I will never support you again. I downloaded the few songs I liked because you won't be ripping me off.

0930289234|5.0|I wanted to read this before the movie released. I'd previously read Alan Moore's V for Vendetta. I was not disappointed. Alan Moore is an amazing writer, and this is a stunning story, very well crafted, very well told. I'm even more excited for the movie now. Why can it not be March already?
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Creating a popular Christmas carol has, I think, been a longtime ambition for Enya.  You can count the attempts, from to the _Sounds of the Season_ mini-album for Target, whose tracks popped up on many versions of _Amarantine_, to the recent snowflake ode \\"Beneath the Falling Snow\\" to 1989's \\"Oíche Chiún\\", a Gaelic version of \\"Silent Night\\".  None, except perhaps \\"Oíche Chiún\\", has really stuck.  _And Winter Came..._ might change that, though.    Top of the list: \\"White Is in the Winter Night\\", blending bright imagery and yuletide cheer with the nimble verbal poetry lyricist Roma Ryan lent to \\"Anywhere Is\\" and \\"Only If...\\".  It's a merry and accessable marriage of Enya's vocal style and Ryan's talent for visual evocation with a carolesque collection of tactile memories of Christmas (\\"gold is in the candlelight / and crimson in the embers / white is in the winter night that everyone remembers\\") that's catchy and fun to sing.  It's a beautiful greeting card.  _Winter_'s other big success is \\"One Toy Soldier\\", a simple, slow Christmas story set to a marching beat; it may seem unimpressive at first, but I was smiling by the jubilant ending.  \\"Soldier\\" proves charming, affecting, and childlike without being the least bit cloying.  This song has the rich and simple, stalwart craftsmanship of an old wooden toy.    The album is bolstered by the standard beauty of \\"Journey of the Angels\\", half-carol, half-hymn, and the rich (yet, paradoxically, somewhat empty) \\"Dreams are More Precious\\".  Both needed a bit more depth to make them truly memorable, but they have a dependable beauty with the slightest odd turn that hooks your ear.  Also included is a version of \\"Oíche Chiún\\", found hither and yon in Enya's oeuvre throughout the years yet never really showcased and perhaps unfamiliar to a wider audience.   It's a well-wrought turn on an old standard and merits inclusion and further attention here.     There are also a couple unconventional tracks that strike.  \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\" has a stark beauty with vocals that recall, to use a paradoxical comparison, a Jewish prayer.  Later verses add reverb and more instruments, which is a mistake; the first part, nearly a cappella, has a tense awe, less a veneration of the Christ child than a hymn from an Israel waiting for a savior.  \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\" is a compelling head-scratcher; it seems to be a modernization of the Nativity story or the flight into Egypt, casting the Holy Family as homeless travelers hitching a ride in a boxcar through an urban blur of \\"neon signs in the night / red and blue city lights\\".  (I may be misreading, but in a Christmas album, typically only one person's arrival is heralded by \\"in the sky a star alone\\".)  The metaphor is unexpected and intriguing, but the song skimps on the lyrics; it's an interesting idea undeveloped.  (Then again, perhaps the open-endedness reflects how the plight of the Holy Family, like that of many modern-day transients for whom \\"every time, it's the same / one more night, one more train\\", has no ready or easy solutions.)  Regardless, the catchy, sideways chorus and the song's pleasantly odd rhythm stick in your head, despite the off sound mixing.    Enya stated that she wanted to make a winter album, not just a Christmas one, and so _And Winter Came..._, befitting the lean season, includes a few meditations on mortality (\\"Last Time by Moonlight\\", \\"Stars and Midnight Blue\\", \\"The Spirit of Christmas Past\\").  These in general aren't successful; while not somber or depressing (they're more expressions of a \\"carpe diem\\" philosophy upon poignant reflection on family memories), and while certainly not bad, they're just not inspiring.  And what's with \\"My, My, Time Flies\\"?  Topical references?  A bridge featuring an electric guitar solo?  Sure, there's a nice sassy Broadway kick to the tune, but last album's \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" covered that territory ably, and a couple lines (\\"could be tomorrow, but then / it could be 2010\\") aregoing to date this badly  -  a strange problem for an artist normally so timeless. \\"Time Flies\\" takes itself so lightly that it's hard to hold anything against it, but it still wandered in from the pop dregs.     But this is supposed to be a fun album, one to celebrate good times, and there it succeeds.  It relies a little too much on reverb, and I miss Enya the composer's elaborately-constructed instrumentals, largely absent since 2000's _A Day without Rain_.  For fans, though, this winter album won't disappoint. For nonfans, those who perhaps want music for a Christmas party or just a change of pace, _And Winter Came..._ proves a nicely different offering  -  not as groundbreaking as her best work, no, but genuinely cheerful and sweetly reflective, with a few carols that deserve to outlast this winter season.        (P.S.: \\"Miraculum\\", the bonus track exclusive to Amazon MP3s,  is a Latin rework of \\"One Toy Soldier\\".  It's not a waste, but much of \\"Soldier\\"'s joy comes from the story told by the English lyrics.  I'd recommend it for completists only.)

B0012BX062|5.0|Another review said something about how this album is nothing but death, and killing. Well lets not forget that was gasgsta rap in the early to late 90's. Not until the turn of the century did rap become watered down BS about money, fame, and having sex. Frankly this will be remembered as the golden age of rap and this album along with Ready to Die are two fine examples for how Rap was.

It is a captivating novel with wonderful characters and a wonderful story line!  A joy for all to read!  I couldn't wait to tell my reader friends about this charming book!
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm covered a lot in the book, but here are my quick takeaways:<br /><br />Cutoff dates matter - The artificial cutoff dates for athletic or scholastic dates do matter.  There is a distinct advantage to have a birthdate as close as possible to the cutoff date.  In general, older children are bigger, faster, stronger and smarter than their age group peers.  The error is that in many cases, we confuse maturity with ability - and then compound these differences until adulthood. My son is an example of this.  He is a second grader but he started kindergarten a year late because of his October birthdate.  So he is at the older range of his class and in reality, there is as much as a 16 month range in ages across his entire second grade class.<br /><br />10,000 hour rule - It takes a lot of time to become really proficient in anything, whether athletic, artistic or occupational skills like software programming or tax preparation.  Studies have shown that there is a 10 year and/or 10,000 hour rule to reach this stage.  For example, a pianist who practices 3 hours per day, 6 days per week will reach 10,000 hours in roughly 10 years.<br /><br />IQ is just a threshold - High IQs are not necessarily a good predictor of success.  However, there is a threshold where you need to be 'smart enough' to be able to succeed.  As Malcolm states in his book, \\"being successful is about a lot more than IQ.\\"<br /><br />Generational limitations - Success also depends on when you are born which drives when you reach adulthood.  For example, to be born between 1900 and 1911 is demographically unlucky as you would have hit the most devastating events of the 20th century - the Great Depression and WWII - at the wrong times.<br /><br />Meaningful work - Observing and participating in \\"meaningful work\\" as defined by autonomy, complexity and a correalation between effort and reward is critical to becoming successful.<br /><br />Social heritance - According to Gladwell, \\"Cultural legacies are powerful forces\\" and they can persist generation after generation long after the social and demographic conditions that created them have passed.  Gladwell told about a psychology study conducted by Dov Cohen and Richard Nisbett at the University of Michigan in the early 1990s around the culture of honor and violence.  It turns out that there is a difference between young men from the Northern and Southern US respond to insults and which partially explains the higher rates of violence in the South.<br /><br />7 errors - A typical accident involves 7 consecutive human errors.  Gladwell examines airline crashes and it is very rare for a crash to be blamed on equipment, and the typical cause is human error.  However, it is not just one human error but a series of small errors that contribute to an eventual catastrophic accident.<br /><br />I thought the book was a great read and it brought up some interesting ideas - it's quick moving and definitely worth your time.fter generation long after the social and demographic conditions that created them have passed.

B00013RC8O|5.0|I saw this in the theater in 1972 while restrained in the Marine Corps and was transported by the music, wide open desert spaces, anti-establishment themes, Kowalski's sense of fair play and nude hippie chicks on motorcycles. In other words all the freedoms I missed while being in the service. I really loved it then and was a little apprehensive about seeing it again as I wasn't sure it would hold up over the years. 36 years to be exact.<br /><br />Well, the movie works on many different levels and it still holds up today for the same reasons it was a great \\"B\\" movie way back in the day. Now, the 1970 Dodge Challenger is a sweet, classic muscle car and just the sound of that engine revving over my home theater system is a nostalgic celebration. (Gotta get me one of those!) We miss Cleavon Little even more as he nearly steals the film as Super Soul the seemingly clairvoyant and misplaced desert DJ. We can still relate to the angst and frustration of not fitting in with mainstream society.<br /><br />There are real humanistic themes here to go along with the weirdness and action. I appreciated Kowalski's sense of fair play, notice how when someone might be injured he usually stops, gets out of the car and determines whether they might need help. Nice touch. He does this in different ways all through the film. You really see the man behind the wheel as a person.<br /><br />I did get concerned about the present value of this film during the first fifteen minutes because the early chases seemed rather like \\"Smokey & The Bandit\\". I was relieved that we move away from there quickly and head into deeper, darker waters. A very entertaining little film, indeed.<br /><br />On the downside I would like to have seen some DVD extras like a \\"making of\\" segment or interviews and a 5.1 remix of the sound would have been great, too. I know, it's an old \\"B\\" movie, I'm just happy it's available at all!

B001H5X7JS|3.0|I wish that studios would release the theatrical versions, rather than the extended versions, of their movies onto DVD and keep the once-deleted scenes as deleted scenes in the Special Features section of the disc.<br /><br />That said, I must admit that I laughed-out-loud several times while watching TROPIC THINDER, now available as a 2-disc \\"Director's Cut\\" from DreamWorks Home Entertainment.  However, I think I would have enjoyed the movie  much more if the producers had not inserted approximately 15 minutes of scenes that had been cut from the theatrical release.  That extra footage slowed the film's pace considerably and I found myself checking my watch before the movie's halfway point.<br /><br />Directed, co-written by and starring Ben Stiller, TROPIC THUNDER is a very clever send-up of Hollywood, filmmakers and war movies, like PLATOON.  Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jack Black play primo dona actors who are starring in a war movie being shot on location in Vietnam.  Stiller is a fading action star, Downey is a 5-time Oscar winner and Black stars in gross-out comedies.<br /><br />When the filming falls a month behind schedule after only  five days of shooting, director Steve Coogan decides to take his cast further \\"in country,\\" in order to get more realism.  Unfortunately, events don't go quite as planned and the actors find themselves up against an army of deadly heroin dealers.<br /><br />A barely recognizable Tom Cruise, as the picture's producer, and Matthew McConaughey as Stiller's agent, nearly steal the movie from the stars.<br /><br />DVD extras include audio commentaries, multiple \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes and deleted scenes.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B00151G08Y|5.0|I really like this album. I got it after hearing one of their songs used in a Formula 1 video and had to find out what it was. It turned out to be Propane Nightmares which is awesome. The guys who put together the video did a great job matching it with the action onscreen, do check it out, I must have watched it a million times and I still hear the engines racing even when I listen to the CD, LOL.    [...................] (play the BELGIUM vid)    Much to my surprise, after listening to the CD for awhile, I ended up liking just about all of it! My initial feelings were great, I only like one song (Propane) but give it time, its really great and worth a look. I will definitely check out their first album (that others say its better is hard to believe). I mostly listen to rock/alt myself, Radiohead and Muse are 2 of my favs. I don't usually listen to dance/electronica which is what I would say this is but its got more attitude than what I'd expect. Plus being a child of the 80's, the sounds of synthesizers brings me back to the music of that decade along with memories of playing videogames (and yes I love that classic midi-style music).
B00004WGC4|5.0|Like all the Monty Python alumni, John Cleese is talented and funny.  From Monty Python (of course) to A Fish Called Wanda, Cleese always just makes me laugh.    And it is not different in Fawlty Towers, where he is at his acerbic and crazy best as the owner of a hotel where circumstances always leads to laughs, and Cleese is surrounded with other actos who do a great job.    Echos of Monty Pythin are here, plus other elements thrown in, so if you are a Python or Cleese Fan you will find the series hilarious. British style humor that works well for all and the extras do add to the set which makes it a wothwhile DVD set to have in your collection since the episodes, like all good comedy, can be watched more than once and still be worth it.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers is an excellent book about some of the often overlooked factors that drive success.  He investigates factors other than the personal meritocratic view of success.  You may not agree with all of his conclusions, but the book does help bring to your attention factors that may not always be taken into account.    Malcolm Gladwell argues through a variety of stories that structural factors often drive who becomes a success - who becomes an \\"outlier.\\"  For example, Canadian superstar hockey players are often born in the first three months of the year.  They often rise to the top because they are the most physically mature of their peers and thus get selected for extra training and better leagues and this intense training that occurs over years helps these players rise to the top of the sport of hockey.    Mr. Gladwell also shows how the year in which a person is born also determines in certain cases the persons chance for success.  This is often driven by demographic troughs in which there are fewer people competing to get into elite institutions.  He also discusses Jewish immigrants and their experience in the New York garment district, New York City lawyers, and also a small town in Pennsylvania in which heart disease is virtually non-existent, among other examples of cases in which structural factors dominate over our conventional views of personal success or accomplishment.    He also discusses experts and expert performance and how it usually takes 10,000 hours for a person to become a true expert.  He ties early selection of young people for \\"gifted\\" and other programs and how how such early selection earmarks the person for additional learning, training, etc. enabling them to achieve the 10,000 hours of \\"practice\\" needed to become an expert.    If you are interested in understanding community, sociology, personal success, structural anthropology, or are just interested in learning generally, this is an excellent book.  It provides excellent insights intohow factors that we have neglected to take into account of our analysis of \\"success\\" and what drives people or allows people to become very successful or to become an expert or other \\"outlier.\\"  Just like Mr. Gladwell's other books \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\" which became best sellers, this book brings to the forefront of our understanding new concepts that we may not have been aware of and thus is a welcome addition to our public discussion and debate about structuring institutions, providing people with \\"second chances\\" for selection, and other opportunities for \\"corrected\\" individual selection these institutions should undertake to select from a larger pool of people.  I highly recommend this book.
B000O76TA4|5.0|The movie edition is the special edition with all the special features - just enclosed in a thin metal casing.  I was impressed that the metal casing is the exact same dimensions as a typical plastic dvd casing.  It just seems more substantial and fitting for a movie of this calibre.  I will definitely buy the Steelbook edition of Man on Fire, and I wish more movies were available in this casing.  The movie itself is great, and the special features are very deep with several commentaries and loads of behind the scenes extras.  I recommend this version for anyone who likes Fight Club considering the Steelbook edition is cheaper than just the regular special edition.

0671799320|4.0|Very informative. If legislators would have read this book back in 1992 we would be energy independent today. Oil is used as a weapon against America, the free World and it's citizens. Even the \\"Big 5\\" oil companies (Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP Arco, Chevron, Conoco Phillips)who operate in America and import oil from the Middle East are putting America and Americans at risk. As the author of, The Truth Behind Gas Prices, I say it is time to get energy independent. The Prize will not tell you how we can do this, but my book will.<br /><br />Richard Clough<br />[...]

1400079276|5.0|Kafka on the Shore is a dream voyage to another land that is nevertheless familiar. It is gentle, violent, abrupt and entrancing. Murakami's worlds take you through the Looking Glass. Sometimes, the world you enter seems strange, disconnected and totally unrelated. But at other times, you feel like you've been offered a glimpse of your personal space of awareness that is typically hidden, but now, suddenly revealed. This novel feels like an invitation to revelation and the unknown. It is brisk, awakening, and warm. Totally unique.

Applause time is minimal with more time for the music, which is clear and lovely.  The DVD and optional commentary in which she speaks of the history of the Alhambra is educational as well as beautiful.  Thanks to Loreena McKennitt for this special performance.

He was referring to Disk 2 and the jam with Winwood, Clapton etc.  But why was Sheryl Crow even allowed in Chicago on the day much less on stage with real musicians. Eric may have owed her or wanted something to allow her anywhere near a guitar. Could she have been backstage entertainment? Oh well. Despite her a great great DVD.
B000002KBU|5.0|simply beautiful.  i avoided joni mitchell not even knowing what she's all about just because i kept on hearing her name everywhere.  i'm in my mid-twenties born a good decade or so after the album was released.  when i first heard A Case of You, i literally touched my heart, or where it should be.  a poem wrapped in the purest voice and the simplest embellishment of guitar breathing out the rawest emotion... great music transcends generations.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Songs are polished and changed but I think the integrity of the song is stil there.  Nice interpretations.  For example \\"I wanna hold your hand\\" and \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\". Great versions.  Lots of good stuff.
1932100660|5.0|I am a man of 70 years and in excellent health.  I'm 5' 10\\" and weigh 150 pounds. I can still jog 5 miles and not feel tired or short of breath - even after two hours at the gym.  My lab test results would suggest that I am a young man.<br /><br />This is NOT genetic good fortune:  My mother died of a heart attack at age 58.  Heart disease and mental illness runs in the family on my mother's side. Alzheimer's disease and cancer runs in my family on my father's side.  Fortunately for me, I was raised in Los Angeles foster care until I emancipated myself at age 15.  In foster care, I hardly ever was fed meat or fish.<br /><br />On my own, I simply had better eating hab8ts than most Americans  For example, I don't eat butter or margarine.  I hardly ever eat in a restaurant.  I prepare my own meals that are fairly lite on animal portions and heavy on vegetables, whole grains, and fruit.  I drink skim milk and rarely drink anything with added sugar or caffeine in it.<br /><br />The last couple years I have been getting positive reinforcement for my eating habits from several books, written by physicians and PhD's.  But after reading \\"The China Study\\" I find I can still improve my eating habits.  I eat more added fats and more protein than I should, and I could make some better food choices.<br /><br />\\"The China Study\\" not only SEEMS sensible, it is well documented.  Every assertion is backed up using scientifically valid research methods, and every chapter has a long list of references near the back of the book - just before the index.  And the reader doesn't have to have a college education to understand the contents.  Of all the health improvement books I have ever read, this one is the best.  It is more scientific, better documented, and broader in scope than any of the others - although most of the others were helpful.

1416914293|5.0|This book was AWESOME!! I loved the City of Bones which is the 1st book in this series in case you didn't know. And if you haven't read the 1st book in the series you need too!! Well Clary has found out that she has a brother, Jace, who in the 1st book she started crushin' on & they actually kissed. So now in City of Ashes they have to deal with the awkwardness of once having major feelings for each other. Now that they know that they are brother & sister they really have a hard time dealing with the situation. And moving on... Clarys best-friend Simon has confessed his love for her & she doesn't have the same feelings for him, but she totally loves him like a brother. Hmmm.. Clary has one messy situation on her hands in the guy department! Alec has started having somewhat of a relationship with Mangus Bane who is basicly the wizard on hand. Mangus is openly gay but Alec however is not and is terrified of being outed to everyone. Issabelle is same old Isabelle not alot going on with her that is one thing that I hope we get to find out in the next book in the series, what is she like. Because for me at least I feel like there is no background telling, really anything about her personal life in the books. Oh! However we do get to know Alec & Issabelle parents in this book. Also we find out alot more about Luke and meet a new weregirl Maia. She adds an interesting twist. One more thing Simons story also takes an interesting turn!! So if you are into YA Fantasy then this is a series you will love to read!! Be sure to read City of Bones first!!
B001GQACGO|5.0|I'll say that at first her single \\"If I Were A Boy\\" i wasn't really feeling it but after a few more listens and watching the accompanying video.  I have a new respect for the song and Beyonce as an artist.  First its her first lead single without a featured single.  Also it's a sparse song that lets her do her thing on the mic and she does it very well.  Explaining to her man would it would be like if she did all the things that he does and doesn't even think about.  How it affects their relationship as a whole.<br /><br />The rest of \\"I Am..Sasha Fierce\\" lets Beyonce show the world what's really going on in her world as the first half of the cd.  Is just that about what she's been through with lots of ballads and slow songs but they never wear the listener down or get boring.  Her vocals are heartfelt, the lyrics are on point and the overall songs are well done and produced.  As she uses a variety of songwriters and producers (but not without her own personal touch on every song) minus the first song.  Also of not the Itunes version of the cd has an excellent addition with the song \\"Save The Hero\\" so check that out as well.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The second half of the cd is her alter-ego, energy-filled and excellent uptempo dance ready songs that folks have come to know from Beyonce.  She rocks each and every one of them..from \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) to \\"Diva\\" and \\"Radio\\".  I'm sure that you will hear these playing at a club on the regular.  While i loved \\"B'day\\" I'm more impressed with \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" because \\"B\\" took a risk and made a complete album minus the featured artist craze that some artists do all too regularily.<br /><br />The cd is sure to do very well for the rest of 2008 and well into 2009 without question.  It's fierce...

B001FSDOZO|5.0|to their previous effort, All The Right Reasons.  This time around the guys in Nickelback bring even more energy this time around.  From the start to finish each song ramps up the music and takes the fans both old and new on a well deserved musical ride.<br /><br />\\"Something in Your Mouth\\" starts off the new effort and has much going for it.  By way of Chad's vocals and playing of the rest of the band.  It's a fast, furious fun song that should be released as the next single off the album.<br /><br />\\"Gotta Be Somebody\\"<br />\\"I'd Come For You\\"<br />\\"Next Go Round\\"<br />\\"Just To Get High\\" feels like it could be an extension of \\"Rockstar\\" (just with some of the lyrics from this song) off \\"All The Right Reasons\\"<br /><br />These are just a few of the songs that should be relistened to and ones that should be getting released as future singles of the album.  This album is a bit more upbeat than the last not comparing the two because they are different.  \\"Dark Horse\\" is the album that should have fans off the fence and into the Nickelback area of things as it's fun to listen to more than just once and should be a favorite for sometime to come.  Excellent effort all around by the guys.
0061122416|1.0|Those that know me well already know that I have a propensity for being the last one in on a fad. That is to say, no, prior to this, I had never read \\"The Alchemist.\\" But several friends told me I needed to, and so I finally got around to reading it.     I put this book in the same category as I do the \\"poetry\\" of Maya Angelou, or the \\"star appeal\\" of Britney Spears. OK, so what's all the fuss about? If that's poetry, then so is all the scribbling on bathroom walls, and if she's talented, I'm the next Emperor of China.     The only good thing I can say about this book is that it was mercifully short. I almost quit around page 80, but I thought, \\"well, I'm halfway through it: maybe the good parts are at the end.\\"     Alas, such was not the case. There is, I believe, a fine line between true mysticism and pop-psycho-quacketry. (Don't look that up: I just invented the word.) This book simply ignores the distinction. To put it, as the Brits might, succinctly: What a lot of claptrap.   When I had finished the book I read all the accompanying articles in the book, including an interview with the author, in which he proudly states that Bill Clinton was seen reading the book and that Julia Roberts had declared it to be \\"the most amazing book!\\"     I wish I had read that interview first: had I known that THOSE two luminaries praised the book, I would have known better than to have read it myself....
B001EO2UKO|2.0|I am a huge fan of Didos first two albums, but I am dissapointed with this one. The lyrics maybe ok, but thats only half the song, because there is nothing musically interesting on this CD. It's just plain dull.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|After viewing Brokeback Mountain, or as some like to peg it, \\"the gay cowboy movie\\", I found myself having to defend it's merits in a debate with my brother.  He made two key arguments:  first, that the love story involved two gay men was a mere ploy to make the movie seem more important than it really is and second, that Heath Ledger's character, Ennis, was let off the hook by the film's ending.  So I'm going to begin this review by responding to each of those criticisms.  There is no doubt that the fact that the two main characters in this movie are gay men is to push an agenda.  But it's not a gay rights agenda.  It's a human rights agenda.  Yes, the movie garnered attention because of its subject matter, but that's the point.  The film wants us to realize that love and desire do not discriminate.  It can find anyone, be it a heterosexual, interracial or gay couple.  By presenting us with two gay men as leads, the film challenges our ingrained predjudices right off the bat.  Surely this will be a movie that will make even the most open minded individual a bit uncomfortable, right?  Wrong.  The genius is that as soon as this beautiful film starts to unspool, we forget that we are watching two gay men.  Jack and Ennis could be any couple who are separated from one another by society's constraints (think interracial couples, rich kid/poor kid, etc.).  They become two human beings who find love with one another but never realize it due to their own fears and the expectations of others.  The movie's goal is to change hearts and minds and in order to do that, it has to prove to its viewers that we are all human and victims of our own emotions and desires, regardless of our sexual orienttion.  If the movie had spent the entire time preaching about the prejudices of society and hammering us over the head with a blatant gay rights agenda, I would have agreed with my brother's first point.<br /><br />His second point does have some merit.  In one reagard, the ending of the film lets Ennis off the hook in the sense that he never has to step forward and make a choice; to continue living a lie or to come to terms with his true nature and make a life with Jack.  In real life, most people faced with Ennis' choice would probably do nothing and simply watch as time passed them by.  So I agree that Ennis did get out of having to make a choice.  But here is what my brother's argument misses:  although Ennis has the choice taken away from him, he does not get to escape the guilt and loss that will live with him for the rest of his days.  He doesn't get to decide whether or not he is going to be haunted by his indecision and he will never get an opportunity to change what could have been.  But is it possible, that by having this choice taken away from him, he will grow and learn and in the future he will act on opportunities?  Sometimes the only way people learn is by their mistakes.<br /><br />Oh, and as for the movie, it's skillfully directed by Ang Lee and the performances are superb.  Jake Gylenhall is great as Jack, the man who is more in touch with his needs and desperrately wants a life with Ennis.  But it is Ledger, as Ennis, who gives this movie its heart.  In Ledger's performance Ennis is a man who doesn't understand his own emotions.  He reacts with anger and violence whenever his regular life bumps up against the urges that are rumbling beneath the surface.  He says more about his loneliness, yearning and anger with downward glances and barely intelligible mumbles than other actors could have with lenghty soliloquies.<br /><br />In essence, Brokeback Mountain is an old-fashioned, tragic love story that never resorts to cheap sentiment and keeps its emotions largely in check....much like its wounded, lost soul, Ennis.lets Ennis off the hook in the sense that he never has to step forward and make a choice; to continue living a lie or to come to terms with his true nature and make a life with Jack.

B00139W3NE|1.0|A Hollywood studio spent millions of dollars making a movie that sucks the life out of a fantastic book--what a surprise!

But don't waste your time on this pointless exercise.
B00168OINK|4.0|Animated films rely heavily on the appeal of the actors voicing the various characters. Get a group of them who could care less about the material and you'll get a quick-to-DVD release (see [[ASIN:B0006JMLRK Shark Tale]]). But get a bunch that really gets into it, and you can capture lightning in a bottle. It's happened before. I consider [[ASIN:B0015HS5S6 Finding Nemo]] and [[ASIN:B000EQ5UHS Hoodwinked!]] to be the prime examples of this type of success. And KUNG FU PANDA now resides in close company with them.<br /><br />Whomever cast Kung Fu Panda deserves some serious recognition. All of the voice characters, without exception, were perfect for their animal type. From Dustin Hoffman's wise Shifu and Angelina Jolies rough Tigress to Jackie Chan (as Monkey), Seth Rogan (as Mantis), Lucy Liu (as Viper) and the unforgettable Jack Black as Po the Kung Fu Panda, every one of them were awesome shining lights of pure ...um ...awesomeness.<br /><br />The story is standard fodder: a nobody Panda (Jack Black) seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a shlepper of noodle dishes. But Po (the Panda) has always been infatuated with the Kung Fu masters. And when a call comes down from on-high that a new master is being chosen, Po rushes to the tower to find out who it might be (will it be Tigress? Or Viper? Or one of the others?). Surprisingly it turns out to be the rotund and out-of-shape Po.<br /><br />Training begins and Po is neither liked nor respected by any of the Kung Fu fighters (yes, the song is in there, too, of course). But once Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) learns how to motivate Po, the training begins in earnest.<br /><br />Problems arise, however, when word spreads that an enemy of the Kung Fu lands has escaped his prison and whomever the new Kung Fu Master might be will have to deal with him.<br /><br />The antics and battles are funny and epic. Using his blubbery size, Po often bounces his way to success, or eats his way into the audience's heart (particularly funny is when he finds a stash of cookies in a high cabinet and does a perfect split in order to reach them and gobble `em down).<br /><br />It is a telling story that shows us you don't have to be some foxy 007 type in order to succeed. Using your natural abilities often times allows you all the power you'll need. And Jack Black's sloth-like nature was a perfect fit for Po and those who enjoyed Kung Fu Panda.<br /><br />Skadoosh!h of cookies in a high cabinet and does a perfect split in order to reach them and gobble `em down).

If you're an adult looking to be entertained, please don't bother. If you want your kid to leave you alone for a minute buy it and play it over and over again. In the end it's my fault for thinking that as an adult I could be entertained by the same people that gave us the newest Indiana Jones movie and Iron Man.

B0016Q2D5M|3.0|It'd be tough to pin down exactly how many times JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH has been adapted to TV and the big screen, but a fairly accurate accounting might be \\"too many.\\" I've been able to find at least eleven adaptations (a few of them foreign productions, but still productions). What's more puzzling is that in 2008 not one but TWO versions of the book made it to film. The first was a [[ASIN:B0016MJ6HE horrible television adaptation in January]] starring Rick Schroeder ([[ASIN:B0017I3RKO Scrubs]]). And the second is this supercharged action version starring Brendan Fraser ([[ASIN:B000EWBKLW Crash]]) who's probably best known for his portrayal as Rick O'Connell in the new [[ASIN:B001HQZJPM Mummy series']] of films.<br /><br />The big question as to this particular Jules Verne story's appeal is obvious: Why? Why so much fanfare and Hollywood hype? Many people have been critical of Hollywood and their lack of originality, and if you use Journey to the Center of the Earth as a barometer to that affect, then you'd be absolutely correct; they have to keep reinventing old shtuff because they can't come up with anything else.<br /><br />Regardless of your take on originality, the one large positive that comes from these hyperbolic recreations is that it introduces a new audience to Verne's masterpiece. And the action in this one is really fun to watch on a big screen with 3-D images plunging into your vision.<br /><br />Although this edition is cool from a visual perspective, I still hold the [[ASIN:B00007JMD8 1959 version starring James Mason]] as the penultimate adaptation. Quirky, funny, and outlandishly impossible (and in technicolor!), the `59 film was an adventure fantasy/SF film ahead of its time. At the 1960 Oscar's it was nominated for three awards, including special effects. I doubt this 2008 recreation will be so blessed. But...<br /><br />It is fun, however. You can't help but smile at some of the newly introduced lines (\\"What? You're thirteen, you can't calls dibs.\\" -- when the two males in the party realized how attractive their guide was). But herein also lay a big problem: distance from the source material. With the exception of getting to the center of the Earth and how they leave it, there's not much Jules Verne left in here. For a beloved classic, that's a shame. But, again, the film will hopefully introduce a new set of readers to [[ASIN:1562549146 the novel]].<br /><br />It is also noteworthy to mention newcomer Anita Briem as the incredibly attractive guide Hannah. A stunning looker in terms of natural beauty, she not only prettied up the film but also gave a surprising rugged quality to her character. Also of note is veteran child star Josh Hutcherson as Sean. Many will recognize him from his roles in [[ASIN:B000DBHX4M Zathura]], [[ASIN:B000P6R5Y8 Bridge to Terabithia]], [[ASIN:B000GCFNZY RV]], and the soon-to-be-released [[ASIN:0316153788 Cirque Du Freak]]. He played well next to Fraser and was the sympathetic character most will come to identify with.<br /><br />The final word...<br /><br />It's an okay diversion with lots of action and an update to Verne's classic, but it's not really Verne's anymore. Beware purists.wo males in the party realized how attractive their guide was). But herein also lay a big problem: distance from the source material.

I do think the music on Death Magnet sounds like the \\"old\\" days, Black, etc..but the lyrics? Obviously getting off the drugs and getting some counseling has killed the ability to write lyrics that mean something. Unforgiven III - sailing? What? I think better lyrics would be \\"I don't have anything to sing about now, but I need the money cuz I used it all on drugs. I know my lyrics stink, just call me unforgiven again, again, oh yeah and again.\\" If there were no words to this cd, I'd probaby enjoy it alot more. I've tried to love it, I've tried to give it a break, but I'm ashamed that I bought it for my son's birthday. I should'a gone with his first choice of the new Disturbed cd.

I simply can't wait to see what he comes up with next, I just think that it'll be a masterful, mature work and will be the last thing we would have expected.  This guy's only in his early 20's; the only artist I ever recall bursting onto the scene this young with such advanced songwriting skills was Roddy Frame.    This album manages to be grand and intimate at the same time, it flows well and has no weak song.  It's easy for symphonic pop to sound overproduced, but this never falls into that trap, in fact it never loses its singer-songwriter feel, and the songs would probably all sound great if it was just him and an acoustic guitar.  Possibly the best LP of 2008.

0684853523|5.0|In On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft Stephen King says that we must come to writing in almost any way but lightly. We may be angry or exhuberant or jealous or anguished. I repeat, as does he, we must come to the craft any way but lightly. This is a side of Stephen King I have neve seen before, and I like it. The book is a wonderful guide to the art, to the craft of writing. My book is new, but is already earmarked and looks worn with age, as all great books should. All true devotees to the craft of writing, all who know that the demands of writing are great, should own this book. It is a revelation.

0316067601|4.0|This is a damn good book.  Not so good if you're looking for TTP's but a very good story about some very tough men.<br /><br />The first half of the book is all about how tough SEALS are, how great the SEALS are, and just how bob bitchin' the SEALS are.  I really, really got sick of hearing how tough, cool, patriotic and elite the SEALS are.  You would think there were no other warriors in the world.  The author goes way overboard emphasizing this and I really got tired of it.  OK, SEALS invented water, walked on it, then turned it into wine.  Holy smokes how about a little humility?<br /><br />When the authors aren't full of themselves, the details of BUDS and how physically exhausting it is, is pretty good.<br /><br />The Book really takes off about halfway through, when the gunfight starts.  It took me about a week to get to that part, then read the second half in a day.  I couldn't put it down and when his team mates started dying it made me really, really sad.  The authors did a great job of putting you there and make you feel for these guys that are dying in a far off foreign land....<br /><br />Overall this was a great book and would have got 5 stars from me if it were not for the overly redundant self ingratiation.  Don't get me wrong, I have immense respect for the SEALS and they are great at what they do. Especially what these guys did, which was give their lives. I do believe in Esprit De Corps, but the book IS way over the top in that dept.<br /><br />If you can get a cheap copy, definitely pick it up.

B001DHXT2U|4.0|\\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is a romp in a Marvel Comics translation into film, but lacks the depth of [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)]] or [[ASIN:B001GZ6QDS The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)]]. What could have been absolutely astonishing becomes only credible viewing enjoyment, a great popcorn movie, as other reviewers have described it.<br /><br />Edward Norton is fine as the scientist Bruce Banner, but not outstanding. He does a credible job with the script as presented, but motive is lacking, a foundation for the story. The film--its writers, director--assumes viewer knowledge of the Marvel story, but a great film would fold the viewer into the story by providing missing background. We know what the Colonel wants but not why Banner was participating.<br /><br />So the film ends up being superficial--all show and no depth. I want to know more about Tim Roth's character, what motivates him. The film certainly gives nod to the stereotype of the military seeking troop enhancement at all costs. Are they all like that? As for William Hurt as the Colonel, he went beyond his usual acting portrayals to give us at least a thoughtful \\"villain\\" rather than his usual bullish portraits. I thought this character was the highlight of the film.<br /><br />And moon-struck Betty? How did these two get together? I have to assume that Betty and Banner worked together, but how? Showing her wearing a lab coat cannot take the place of some kind of explanation. What is their connection? I know that a film cannot be all-inclusive but some are. [[ASIN:B001C08RHA Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)]] did just that! Now there's a five-star film!<br /><br />\\"Incredible Hulk\\" is certainly a well-made film--the cinematography is awesome!--but it takes more than film editing and CGI to make an incredible movie. Although I enjoyed the movie, I finished wanting just a little more. However, the final scene is something to cheer about! May it happen!

0142406562|5.0|Stormbreaker is a new whiz-kid kind of computer that Herod Sayle wants to put into every English school in the country. M16 (you know, James Bond's world) is supportive of the effort, but officials want the skinny on Sayle just in case he is not the philanthropist he seems to be. Ian Rider, an M16 agent, is killed trying to learn this background.<br /><br />Thus sets the beginning of the Alex Rider series, a thrill-a-minute ride (pardon the pun). Ian Rider was Alex's uncle and guardian, who lived his public life as a bank manager. The only bank he managed was the bank-on-it, it's the spy business! Alex discovers his uncle's identity through a spy-like setup by M16 officials. They want him to assume work where his uncle left off.<br /><br />His mission, should he accept it--and he will have no choice--is to continue to learn what he can about the Stormbreaker with a signature lightning bolt across its side. M16 trains him extensively for two weeks, then sends him out on his mission.<br /><br />Everything that happens to him from this point on is unbelievable, unless you examine each situation and finally admit, yes, this could be possible. Given that he is in unusual circumstances doesn't mean he can't do the job. Alex must improvise almost constantly.<br /><br />The amazing gee-gaws he is given by the equipment team are stunning and, of course, work out perfectly for his benefit. For example, the one that melts metal (it looks like skin blemish medication, ha ha) but comes in very handy at the appropriate time. I wonder if Anthony Horowitz laid out his story beforehand, knowing that Alex would need this cream in this scene, or if he invented the products and decided their use as the scene developed.<br /><br />Oh, why is this book believable when impossible situations arise for the average fourteen-year-old? Alex is not average because of his M16-employed uncle. In fact, his uncle began training Alex at an early stage in self-defense, sports skills such as scuba diving and snowboarding, language acquisition by living in three other European countries, and how to drive, as well as other skills.<br /><br />This series is great reading for the middle school set, ages 11-15, depending on interest and reading level. It's not an easy read, but definitely not difficult. There is violence but not too graphic, no cursing, and no \\"adult situations.\\" It would appeal to action junkies, thrill seekers, and Double 07 fans, all of which I am one.<br /><br />I wish to inject a theme.

B00004XPPB|4.0|D. Brasco is a good story and is alot less violent than most mob movies. It isn't as good as the Godfather or Goodfellas. This movie shows the sacrifice of a F.B.I. agent who loses years of his life with his family to bring down the mob.
B001EOQWFI|1.0|Here is a minimalist approach to children's movies.  Forget the story line.  Forget what was learned in Finding  Nemo.  The cricket ends up as a pathetic device.  Create a film without dialogue or characterization, except for the scene where the robot runs about calling Eve's name.    Have an environmental message that would completely baffle little children before putting them to sleep,    Embrace the abstract while making some obtuse reference to fat people drifting along on floating rafts who cannot do for themselves. What this has to do with Wall-E is a lost cause.  Oh, yes, create a captain character who has no personality, who is pathetic.  Who would have believed that Walt Disney would forget their primary market--children?  Gee, if Walt Disney/Pixar continue in the same direction as Wall-E, their future will end up as dismal as the brown planet in the movie!  What were they thinking?  Have they run out of plots and lovable characters to tell their story?
0756404746|5.0|From the gentle beginning set in a quiet tavern, Patrick Rothfuss' story draws you into its world, and by the time you're a little more than ten pages in you'll have been transported, and find yourself in the midst of the narration, wholly unable to pull yourself away from the story.  The main character, Kvothe, takes us through his life, revealing the facts behind the myths of his actions and feats.  The story isn't your typical fantasy, and is devoid of cliche, elves, and wicked wizards.  however, it more than makes up for that by being rich with story, humor, and tension.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1401203078|2.0|I'm not going to go into the detail that some of the other reviewers have.  I will merely say, the 2 star reviews are spot on. This book has some serious issues and isn't worth the price.  If you buy it in the bookstore, it even comes wrapped in plastic, so you can't open it up and see what a piece of meat you're getting.    Bad show, move on Alan.
B0012BX062|1.0|I bought this because it was on sale and is extremely popular. After a few hours of listening to it I deleted it from my computer.<br /><br />There's too much death in this music, all it talks about is death, dying and shooting in gory detail. Things like girls getting mutilated by gunshots and brains being sprayed all over the sidewalk.<br /><br />If people like listening to stuff like that then you'll love this album. As for me, I don't see why anyone would. Rap is great when its clever and talking about something important. I wouldn't waste your money on this and instead use it for something that has a little thought put into it like Immortal Technique or Talib Kweli.

B001EO2UKO|1.0|I own and love Dido's first 2 albums, so I was eagerly anticipating this release.  I've listened to it 4 times through, and all I can say is that I miss the old Dido.  This album is too slow and lacks any catchy beats.  That's what I most enjoyed about her previous albums.  I'm still a fan, but I'm not going to rush out and buy her next album without hearing it first.    Disappointed
B0019T9FL6|5.0|This CD grew on me. I started out listening to the songs I liked, Spotlight, My Heart, I'm His Only Woman.  But as I explored the other songs, I found this to be a very soulful collection of songs that each tell a story.  Jennifer has a very powerful voice and a heartfelt delivery.  The only song I really can't relate to is Pocketbook, although I love me some Luda.  This is a great CD to sit back and relax with that special someone.  It's nice to listen to someone who can ACTUALLY sing.  A good debut album and I look forward to more from Ms. Hudson and will keep her in my prayers.

0312427646|5.0|Bennett drags the reader in by a series of humorous incidents as the Queen moves from a non-reader to accomplished literary critic or even writer.<br />Rushing out to stop the royal dogs barking at the portable library the Queen borrows a book and it opens a new world for her. Incidents such as these at the Palace with the dogs , Prince Philip ( who says  \\" Are you all right old dear ?')

Something of interest to all readers.<br />An innovative, humorous and thoughly enjoying novella . I strongly recommend it
B00004Y6NU|4.0|I've been a so-so casual Dire Straits fan for quite a while. I came upon this recording many years ago and it passed from my listening stack.    But it left an impression. At this point in my life I'm revisiting some recordings that left a mental mark, so I purchased it again this time on cd.    And I love it again. The ethereal feel and mood (and playful FUN of Industrial Disease), wonderful instrumentation and playing that builds compositions and not singles...it takes me on imaginary journeys. I love to just sit back, soak it in and let it take me way.     A standout performance in my collection.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|28 Days is a fabulous movie that stirs many emotions associated with addiction, immaturity, and insecurity. Sandra Bullock plays a character that demonstrates how many perceived strong and \\"vibrant\\" people in our lives, are too often driven by hidden insecurities and emotional pain. The movie centers around a beautiful and charismatic woman about 30 years old, that has surrounded her life with equally colorful and insecure people that routinely gather and celebrate in public places, all attempting to demonstrate that they are part of the \\"in-crowd\\". Although these people can be perceived to be having the time of their lives, it turns out they really have no life at all - and do a great job of indirectly hurting themselves and their family. Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a common outcome, and I am guessing that we all may know people like this.<br /><br />The movie makes you laugh and cry, and really makes you think about those people in your lives that may mask an internal pain, with external friendliness or happiness - maybe even ourselves. I can't imagine a better actress than Sandra Bullock to play this role, and have to say I really enjoyed the intelligence of this movie.<br /><br />GREAT MOVIE!
6304712936|5.0|I've loved this movie for years and bought this dvd to replace my old vhs version.  I was surprised to find only one disc and moreso to discover that it is reversible.  When it came to the end of side one I wasn't sure what to do, but tried flipping it over and sure enough, there was side two. I didn't know there was such a thing and a couple of friends I asked didn't know it either. I don't buy a lot of current dvd's, maybe this is old stuff, but it was news to me..lol..
B00003CXQY|4.0|Hilarious movie--way for Disney not to take itself so seriously.  2-disc version worth the extra few dollars over the 1-disc one.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I am IRON MAN. It's about as epic as it sounds.  I didn't go in to the theater with high expectations. But, after the movie was over I was speechless.  This movie has everything from comedy to action.  Iron Man opens with a breathtaking view of a desert.  Not bad.  Then you find out that it's in Afghanistan and the warm and fuzzy feeling fades away.  A military car comes into view fallowed by some rock music.  Still a bit confused.  That scene in the car with Dowry Jr. is probably one of the best scenes in the movie.  Not for class but for comedy.  And he doesn't miss a beat throughout the entire film.  The director does a good job of easing you into the movie and then he hits you with an explosion.  After that the movie cuts to a flash back of Tony Stark's life and what he is all about.  This movie can be a little confusing at first but its work the confusion.  Iron Man is warm, funny, action-packed and very visual.  Whoever came up with the costume design for the suit is a genius. If you have a chance I would definitely recommend this movie.  Anyone will love it.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Being a musician myself and an early No Doubter- I thought I would see what Gwen was up to lately, so I purchased this CD.....what a heartbreak & disappointment    This CD represents what happens to a talented  musician and song writer, it shows what fame can do to a  once a unique lead singer in a great band, that now seems to be abandoned, to a breast implanted million dollar Bim Bo,  Maddona wanta be?  Who the hell is the idiot she is taken advice from.....    This has to be the worst piece of crap I think I ever have heard come from the industry and I have heard a lot of crap, so bad that I actually Frisbeed the cd out my car window in absolute discuss.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I loved this movie. More then I've enjoyed any movie in a long time. Yes, it's fluff. But as many times as I saw it in the theatre, I never failed to leave smiling. No, it's not perfect cinematography. Nor is it perfect singing or acting. And maybe it is a bit over the top in some places. But there's more to it then I think some people are getting.     I love that the two male members of Abba make cameos. I love the nod to the old Greek plays they give with the islanders being the gods in disguise to get Donna where she needs to be (watch the \\"Mama Mia\\" scene again if you don't understand what I'm talking about.) I love the fact that the actors seem to have FUN. Like it or not from a technical view, there was a lot of creativity and FUN in that piece. And I love the energy and the joy in this movie.     And to the person who said it's not appropriate for a young girl - have you SEEN a movie recently? Or watched TV? \\"Mama Mia\\" is a lot more innocent fun then most things you're going to find out there.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|This was a great movie for kids with the 3D.  I however could not watch the 3D. Being over 40 my eyes would not both focus at the same time to ensure the 3D effect.  The 2D version was good but I lost interest in the story line about half way thru the movie.      If I had not seen the old version with Pat Boone then it would have been more interesting.      The visual effects are very good.     I give it three star because it lost my interest so quickly and I am usually easily amused!

0575081406|5.0|So I get this book and I am about 70 pages in but I have a ton of other stuff in my reading stack. I (foolishly) lent it to a friend who is plagued, like me, by insomnia and a vicious hungry reading habit. I figured since the plot is good and the characters hooked me in and made me CARE about them it was all good. However, she read the book, lent it to her wife who read it, and then they BOTH re-read it. Since that's almost done, I figure the only way to pry this book out of there is mentioning there is a sequel. I am calling this a delicious read because I love it when I start a book and after 45 minutes I pull my head out of it and look to see the page count because I know I wont want it to end! Get it when you can devote the time to it. Harry Potter fans, fantasy fans etc will not be disappointed I think.

0439813786|3.0|So yeah, the illustrations were neat.  Yes, I highly liked the design and the color of the pages.  But the story itself?  Overrated.  Nothing much happens.  The passages are short.  At the end of the book, it's revealed that the entire story is based on a real person, really ruining the book for me.  It started out really powerfully and you think, hey, this might actually be a neat, slightly supernatural mystery, but nope, all you've got is a boring book about artists and film-makers.  It took only half an hour to read, and the majority of the book just had me flipping through pictures, when I had expected it to be an \\"illustrated\\" book as in 'there are small images maybe once per chapter.'  This had such potential, and I'm having lots of trouble understanding all the hype surrounding it.  Not as tremendous as it should have, could have, and is portrayed to be.

B001E75QH0|5.0|I am a Harrison Ford Fan.  The only movie in the pack that I did not enjoy was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I bought the pack because I wanted all of the Indiana Jones movies in one fell swoop and this was pretty good price.  I hadn't seen the latest one and that was a plus, as well.    My favorite is still Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - I watch that one over and over.  I like Raiders of the Lost Ark, but the new one, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has the number 2 spot for me.  It was adventerous and exciting and intersting since Harrison Ford is so much older.  The ending was a little different holding open the idea of a newer, younger Indiana Jones, but perhaps not...    If you like Indiana Jones, then this is worth it, even if you don't like one of the movies.
0312360266|3.0|This book was too simple for my liking. However, it is a great set up for book 2, which I loved. If you are a fan of Twilight or the Gemma Doyle Trilogy, you will like this book. It is has elements of \\"Mean Girls\\" and talks about Gossip Girls and cool clothing. I recommend it for teen girls.
B001F290E4|4.0|Boy, this was a hard review to write simply because I have always loved Seal's work and still find his voice very comforting.  I purchased this album after a live performance he did of Sam Cooke's \\"A Change is Gonna Come.\\"  I was unaware that the entire work was one of covers.  I personally do not like many covers and after hearing some of these songs know why.  If you are forunate enough (or unfortunate as many reviewers may think) to NOT know the originals for some of these songs, you may fall in love with them.  I never heard the originals for a handful of these songs and those quickly became my favorites as they were NEW to me, seemed like SEAL songs, and there was no basis for comparison.  However, learning of these \\"new\\" songs had me wanting to later find and listen to the original versions.     I think \\"SOUL\\" is extremely disjointed.  Some artists are fortunate enough to find or develop tracks that seamless flow into one another.  This one does not.  Had Seal stuck with an entire album of slower, melodic ballads as the opener, it may have been a less bumpy ride.  Throwing in the more up-tempo tracks like Al Green's \\"Here I Am\\", Curis Mayfield's \\"It's Alright\\" and  \\"Knock On Wood\\" left me wanting to hit \\"skip track\\" on my remote as they sounded like (and it pains me to say this) bad karaoke or something done by \\"the wedding singer.\\"      Some classics are better left untouched or have been redone too many times already.  Ben E. King's \\"Stand By Me\\" is an example of a song that should NEVER be attempted by anyone simply because it is too well known and has King's trademark sound which can never be duplicated.  And I dare anyone to try to listen to \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now\\" and NOT think of Simply Red.  Their version trumps even the original and in a way has become one of their classic hits.      Surprisingly, the song \\"Free\\" if you never heard it, which I had not, sounds very Seal-esque and could have fit well on any of Seal's prior works or would have beena wonderful reprise type song to add to a future work of his own originals.      I must confess that despite my disappointment in the album as a whole, there are a few tracks that I loved and could listen to back to back, over and over and made this worth purchasing.  Not knowing the orginals aided this list for me and again all of these tracks are similar in style and feel.  Track 1, Sam Cooke's \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\", Track 3, James Brown's \\"It's A Man's World\\" and Track 9, Al Green's \\"I'm Still In Love With You\\".  I wish Seal would have delved deep in the music history vault and pulled other, similar tracks as these that have yet to be redone.  That could have taken \\"SOUL\\" from so-so to super! Seal, it's time to revisit \\"Crazy.\\"
B001D08SK0|1.0|I have 3 versions of \\"Kind Of Blue.\\" I have the MD version, the old Columbia Masterpiece remaster, and the newly Columbia remaster with added alternate takes. I think something like this is a huge waste of money even from a collector's standpoint. If you didn't have \\"Kind Of Blue,\\" then I can see something like this being a good investment, but take it from a jazz collector like myself, it's not worth $70. It's worth maybe $25 or $30. I'm disappointed that Columbia continues to put this album out. I mean it's like we get the idea already. It's a groundbreaking album, but how many times does it have to be released?<br /><br />Columbia seems to do this a lot and totally ignore other jazz legends that recorded for them like Thelonious Monk and Dave Brubeck. The attention to Thelonious Monk's discography on Columbia isn't that great. I have all the re-issues of his albums and the attention to Dave Brubeck is even less. Miles wasn't the only jazz musician that mattered on that label. Wake up Columbia! Pay attention to the people, like myself, who think you should start releasing out-of-print Dave Brubeck Quartet albums like the rest of the \\"Time\\" series, \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" etc.<br /><br />As I mentioned, if you already have different versions of \\"Kind Of Blue,\\" then I don't see any reason why you should buy this, unless you like throwing money away. To those who don't have this album and want to explore the album that made Miles a legend, then you might want to pick it up, but you can buy the individual album so much cheaper and still get the same quality. Thumbs down, Columbia!<br /><br />*Special update to potential buyers: Columbia will be releasing a special two-disc version of the 50th Anniversary of \\"Kind Of Blue\\" in January, so save your money and just buy this edition as it will contain the unreleased material from this box set.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|The return on Indy left me waxing nostalgic but the plot was a bit thin.
003061368X|5.0|I love to read historical fiction, but don't love the droning of history books.  This was a fun, entertaining, easy to read novel of 15th century England.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|Oh Man...I can listen to this all day long.  I LOVE Bar-Ba-Sol.  My fave part is at 20 secs...that bass--oh that bass!  Kudos to the drums and bass player.  They really make it a rock album and not an AI album.  And who can't relate to Lie?  I mean how many of us choose to ignore the truth just to avoid being crushed?  And Permanent is so SAD!  That is so about his brother you can tell.   And Come Back to Me brings back memories from a day when I thought I needed to find myself as well.  However, I don't remember my man saying I'll wait for you though.  DC has a LONG career ahead of him. AWESOME ALBUM!  BUY IT!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I really enjoy this soundtrack. It doesn't exactly say \\"Twilight\\" to me, but  I still like the music. After watching the movie, I feel like this music went really well with all the scenes. I really wish Robert Pattinson would have not slurred all his words so much though. He has a really nice voice!
0345350499|4.0|This is one of the books I read many years ago, that inspired me to read more about my Pagan cultural background. It is a gritty tale, in the tradition of the dark & at times disturbing style of our own ancestral myths.<br /><br />It is well written, and like all good fantasy, draws the reader into a world of intrigue and endless possibility. It also offers a sympathetic view of Pagan spirituality.<br /><br />As long as you avoid taking this as anything more than inspirational fantasy, it is a darn good read.
B000050XEI|5.0|My wife loves this and me too.  Maybe the best from Enya as my personal view.
B0001I561E|5.0|I've loved this ever since I was a kid. I love the plot, and the direction. It's a classic! Aladdin is a poor kid who lives in the streets of Agrabah who has to steal to eat His friend is a monkey named Abu. Princess Jasmine is being forced to marry, so she runs away.

When he goes back to Agrabah, everyone thinks he's a prince, with the help of Genie. Jafar gets the lamp, and brings destruction to Agrabah. Aladdin must stop him before it's too late. I highly recommend ALADDIN!!!

B00005K9LM|5.0|Priest hit it big in the 80s.  After the groundbreaking 1980 release of \\"British Steel\\",the band took a slip in quality with there next release,\\"Point of Entry\\".    This slip was made up with there biggest commercial success,the classic,\\"Screaming for Vengeance\\".    However the band wasn't quite as heavy overall on that album and compensated for a heavier release resulting in this album.    In my opinion,this is the Priest album of the 80s with the most pure metal outlook,an absolute blind attack of metal purity that unfortunately the bad foresakes for half a dozen years.    Now mind you,the writing was never back to the brilliance of there 70s releases,but few albums were as consistently rocking as this heavy classic proved.    It seems underrated,yet seriously,more fan favorites have sprung from this album than any other of there 80s albums.(Even British Steel).  Here's the album,Track by track:    Freewheel Burning-This opens the album with one of Rob's best vocal performances.  One of the best OTTs of the band's career.    Jawbreaker-Another Classic with another definitive vocal performance,and a particularly burning solo by Tipton.    Rock Hard Ride Free-Dumb as hell,but who dosen't pump there fist to it?  A live favorite that we all continue to rock to,\\"ALL DAY!ALL NIGHT!\\".    The Sentinel-The best track on the album.  This is the epic,a sci-fi tale of a hitman from hell.  The intro is one of the great metal intros,ever.    Love Bites-Wonderfully high octane gothic track with a great riff and one of Rob's most predatory vocal jobs,singing about his intentions as a sexually driven vampire(what other kind IS there?).  That ending is headbanging goodness!    Eat Me Alive-PMRC favorite,originally titled \\"Bad Girls Wear Leather\\" is a hilarious song about.....just guess.  Absolutely awesome.  Rob confesses he was in a deep state of inebriation when he wrote it!    Some Heads are Gonna Roll-Not written by the band actually,but a classic headbanger that fits them justfine.  One of there best songs,with a chorus that won't stay out of your head!    Night Comes Down-One of Priest's all time best ballads that is heavy enough to work with great guitar work and vocals.  Somewhat reminiscent of there 70s work combined with an 80s sensibility.    Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith-A triumphant ending to a great metal record,as Rob and the audience proclaim what they are and always will be.  Defenders of the Faith.    Absloutely classic record that is an essential for any true metalhead.    Get it now.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Basically, this album is classic enya. Regardless of the themes of Christmas and winter, she hasn't done anything remotely drastic to her sound ... so if you believe enya's music to be too samey and you are hoping for change, this isn't for you.    If you are an Enya fan and liked her most recent albums (a day without rain, amarantine) as well as her earlier work, then I think you will like this.    The music- instruments and arrangements, vocal layering etc are classic enya... I personally don't find her music too samey and enjoy listening to every album when it comes.. I can see why some people complain she won't change, but I (like many others I suspect) wouldn't want it any other way... it's this sound I want and am buying into, that soothing, relaxing gentle sound...    This Christmas / winter album won't disappoint if you accept she isn't straying too much from the enya sound we know and love.     I should point out, the album is really a Christmas album, this winter tag is something of a new record industry gimmick I suspect... people don't want to call their albums Christmas albums anymore in case it offends non-christians or restricts the market for the album too much I guess..  This album is laden with Christian refernces to the nativity story of the birth of jesus, so if that is likely to offend , disinterest you, this won't be for you.    As a Christian, this is exactly what I want, meaningful Christmas music.    Winter is a theme that does run through the album but the album really is a Christmas album... because most of the tracks reference Christmas more. Still, there are a few tracks (slightly less than half ) that could be listened to throughout the year.    My faves: I love the instrumental And Winter Came, the dark but uptempo Trains and Winter Rains, the soothing Last Time By Moonlight, and the reflective and gentle The Spirit of Christmas Past and My My Time Flies is terrific... really catchy and a change on sound for enya, more pop sounding.Also, White is the Winter Night is the catchiest song on the album... I agree with many others... this would have been the best choice for single and it would be much more radio friendly too.     Also, I've heard many criticise this as a commercial and cynical album... the idea and the label pushing for a full Christmas album from enya would indeed suggest to many that yes this is this case (don't forget we've had 2006's Amarantine Christmas re-release edition and last years Christmas secrets ep.) but, enya  has avoided the pitfalls of simply cashing in with a Christmas album... she has stayed true to her sound and self... the songs all maintain her deeply reflective and spiritual tones of past work... nothing vacuous here.    Finally, enjoy if you buy. And thank you enya for a perfect chrsitmas album to relax to...  Just as no one else can sound like enya generally, her Christmas album is a unique gem in the Christmas music market... a soulful, soothing listen.
B000QXDED6|4.0|I didn't know much of what to expect--just that it was a historical war movie.     I tell you this so you'll understand why I was underwhelmed for the first quarter of the movie. The monochromatic filming, mostly in sepia tones, but then occasionally in blues, got pretty irritating. And then there was the Heroic Music and the Ominous Music trying to get me all excited or worried about characters I didn't even know yet. And that was really irritating.    It starts off with voice-over narration and a little boy going off to be trained as a Spartan warrior. Complete with a weird-looking CGI wolf. I couldn't figure out why they couldn't use a real wolf. Lots of scrawny kid skulking around being shadowed by a goofy looking wolf with the dramatic music. In sepia.    Truthfully, I was tempted it to the males and go off to the computer or a book.    But it's a good thing I kept watching. Once the boy grew up, he became King Leonidas (Gerard Butler). Xerxes of Persia invades, and Leonidas goes to the Oracle to get... well, basically to get permission to repel the invasion. But the priests are paid off and they advise against it. So Leonidas takes 300 men for a walk.    There's intrigue back home as the Queen tries to send reinforcements, but mostly, it's battle scenes. The fighting did really remind me of the Alerans in [[ASIN:0441016553 Captain's Fury (Codex Alera, Book 4)]]--the shieldwall type of fighting and the disciplined soldiers were very familiar.    The cinematography continues, with the colored filters and a somewhat dizzying switching between slow motion and fast forward. Here's where knowing what I was getting into might have helped. I've since discovered that 300 is based on a graphic novel that's based on a movie that's based on history. And then it made sense--the cinematography gave it that stylish, surrealistic feel that fits with the graphic novel.    It also made the violence much easier to take for this squeamish viewer.    So, 4 stars, but if I'd knownwhat to expect, I'd probably have enjoyed it a half-star more.
1400031362|5.0|This book actually brought tears to my eyes in the closing pages.  MFBG is an amazing book in a delightful series.  Having read the first three books, I see why the first one burst onto the NY Times bestseller list.  They are engrossing and a pleasure to read.<br /><br />The story of Precious Ramotswe is the frame for other stories.  Her story and character are charming and reflect everything fundamentally good in human nature.  Mma Ramotswe reminds me a bit of Diane Mott Davidson's Goldie in that she is an independent self-employed professional who we meet after one dreadful marriage and who develops a positive, long term relationship in the course of the books.  You learn her past, watch her evolving life story, and share in her thoughts.<br /><br />Unlike many mystery books, these are not hard-boiled and classically \\"tough.\\"  Each book has several situations the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency solves, consults on, or investigates and advises.  Mma Ramatswe's greatest gifts are her ability to listen and her courage to speak up and occasionally bluff in strained circumstances.  Her instincts are credible, she's lucky, and so far she hasn't missed a trick.<br /><br />Like a good Western, where a classic human interest story is transported to the setting of the Old West, these stores are touching and timeless.  And like a good science fiction story which explores a different reality, these stories transport us to Botswana and paint a vivid picture of a foreign land, its people and culture, displaying humanity identical to our own.  These stories could have been set on Antares IV, in Chicago, Laredo, or London.  The African setting is intriguing and molds the stories to its hot dry world.<br /><br />My preference is to read a series in the order in which it was written so as to walk with the author as the characters evolve.  These are characters I love.  Their pride and courtesy are refreshing.  The sensory delights of Africa unfold along with genuinely puzzling mysteries.  These are beautiful books.  Enjoy.  Hope you like pumpkin.oks.  Enjoy.  Hope you like pumpkin.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|Rocky Balboa is pretty much what you'd expect. Rocky's retired from boxing and running a little Italian restaurant where he gives fellow former boxers free meals and entertains the customers with stories from his days as the champ. But Adrian's dead, and Rocky's living in the past, and their son is tired of living in his famous father's shadow.    The current champ, Mason Dixon, is suffering from a bad reputation. He's had nothing but knockouts, so boxing fans are complaining that he's only taking easy fights and that he's not a \\"real\\" champ.    A computer simulation fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon that shows Rocky winning brings everything to a head. Rocky wants one last fight, and Mason Dixon's promoters want an exhibition match between the two to shore up Mason Dixon's reputation.    There are a lot of flashbacks, of course, and the training scenes are similar to [[ASIN:B0006GAOGI Rocky IV]], contrasting Rocky's working-man methods with Mason Dixon's high-tech. And we get the raw eggs and beef carcasses, too, just because.    And there's a new girlfriend for Rocky, to add a little hope for the future for him, since this really has got to be his last fight.    It's not nearly as good as the first movie, of course, but it's a much better end to the series than [[ASIN:B0006GAOGS Rocky V]].
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is one of the best videos I have ever seen.  My husband and I read the John Adams book by David McCullough and this follows it very good although there are some parts missing.  You need several days to watch the video, but it is absolutely wonderful!  The actors playing John Adams and Abigail Smith Adams should receive an Academy Award!  They were exquisite.  Tom Hanks was the producer and it really showed his expertise.  Anyone who likes history, and our American history especially needs to see this video.
B0009UC810|5.0|When Jake and Elwood Blues are reunited after Jake's stint in Joliet, Jake finds that the beloved Bluesmobile has been replaced by a former City of Mount Prospect police car, and the Blues Brothers Band has been disbanded.    They visit \\"the penguin,\\" the nun who runs the orphanage where they grew up, only to find that the orphanage will be shut down unless they come up with $5000 in back taxes. Since she vetoes any suggestion of ill-gotten gains, Jake comes up with a plan: put the band back together.    From then on it's non-stop action, laughs, and music, as they're \\"on a mission from God\\" to collect the former band members one by one, equip them, then try to get enough gigs to earn the money. Along the way, they also collect quite a trail of people out to get them: a mystery woman armed with everything from a bazooka to a flamethrower, Illinois Nazis, a country-western band, as well as the cops.    Star-studded doesn't begin to cover the casting, either. It's practically a who's who of rhythm and blues, as well as immediately recognizable actors. Check the IMDB for the list.    As with Blazing Saddles, the humor is hilarious without being pointless. Maybe I'm showing my age, but my sons agreed, and it's something we've discussed about other movies as well. In this case, nobody's safe from being skewered by humor, and everything's a target: relationships, crime, racism, poverty, country music, etc., etc. It's no surprise that The Blues Brothers' roots are in the original irreverent TV show (SNL).     Anyway, it's a classic that I never get tired of, and I'm not a very patient person when it comes to re-watching movies, so that's saying something. Plus, it's fun to send the boys off to school in the morning with \\"remember, you're on a mission from God.\\" (Okay, maybe that's just fun for me.)
B000002LIM|5.0|The Batman soundtrack by Danny Elfman is one of the best soundtracks to any movie, ever.  There is not a weak track on the whole album.  Anybody who has seen the movie remembers the familiar soundtrack.  This music is powerful, haunting and gothic at the same time.  This music really portrays the darkness of this great movie.  This is Danny Elfman's best work, in my opinion.  My favorite tracks are 1. The Batman Theme (a classic), 2. Kitchen, Surgery, Face-Off, 3. Flowers (eerie and emotional),<br />4. Clown Attack, 5. Descent Into Mystery, 6. Attack Of The Batwing (dramatic), and 7. Up The Cathedral (really dramatic).<br /><br />This soundtrack is far superior to The Dark Knight soundtrack, which is repetitive.  I highly recommend this soundtrack for fans of this great 1989 movie and for fans of dark classical music. For people who have never even seen the movie, you'll still enjoy this soundtrack.

B001GQ2TGA|4.0|If you have the same taste in Enya's music as me then prior to this album being released, your own personal Enya Greatest hits CD consists mostly of the following songs:<br /><br />Storms in Africa II<br />Amarantine<br />Book of Days<br />Caribbean Blue<br />Anywhere is<br />Only if<br />Orinoco Flow<br />Only Time<br /><br />With that being said, you can add 3 songs to that list from Enya's new album AND WINTER CAME,,,,<br /><br />1. MY! MY! TIME FLIES ! : Although if released as a single it may not become the mega hit that ONLY TIME became, it could be the cross over hit that ORINOCO FLOW became.<br />MY MY,, is a very catchy upbeat song that includes an electric guitar solo. Yes you read that right, an ELECTRIC GUITAR!<br />MY MY,, is the type of song that could catch on various radio formats and could easily be remixed like ONLY TIME was remixed for radio.<br /><br />2. TRAINS AND WINTER RAINS: Within the first 3 seconds TRAINS,,, is instantly recognizeable as an Enya song which is part of the reason Enya is so widely popular. Enya has a unique sound all to her own and TRAINS,, does not disappoint as a catchy song with many vocal and istrumental layers.<br /><br />3. WHITE IS IN THE WINTER NIGHT: The best way to describe this song is that it sounds like a cross between ANYWHERE IS and ONLY IF. With easy to sing a long vocals and an upbeat tempo, you cant help but be in a good mood when listening along.<br /><br />There are other good selections included in this album but as I said in my opening paragraph, if you are looking for songs to include in your ENYA greatest hits mix, TRAINS AND WINTER RAINS, WHITE IS IN THE WINTER NIGHT AND MY MY TIME FLIES will surely be included in any ENYA greatest hits CD that you make for your listening pleasure.
1596434252|4.0|ABC3D is not groundbreaking in any sense of the word, but it takes a familiar childhood concept and improves it until it is barely recognizable. I first saw this item on a popular blog and immediately placed an order. Though you are unlikely to go through it more than once yourself, it certainly is a great conversation starter and can happily reside on your coffee table if you so desire.   Its very well made, and looked just as good in my hands as it did online. It makes a good gift, granted that the recipient ought to be just as quirky and nerdy as you to truly appreciate it, since it has little value once the novelty has worn off.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I regret that I missed \\"Love Actually\\" at the theater.  I'm so glad that I bought the DVD, because it has become one of my favorite movies, and certainly one that I see at least once during the holidays every year.  I never tire of it.  The music and characters are full, real, and wonderful. It's not all laughs, but it's life affirming.     As charming as it is, \\"Love Actually\\" is strictly an ADULT movie, not family fare. It wouldn't be the unique movie it is without the adult scenes and language, but be forewarned.     Soundtrack includes music by many artists. Check out the soundtrack album here on Amazon.Com.

B001G60FSY|3.0|Although I found \\"blink\\" engrossing, Gladwell's talent as a writer often lets him get away with murder.  The distinctions he makes sometimes seem arbitrary, particularly if one takes just a little more than 2 seconds to mull things over.  Some of his extrapolations not only seem unjustified but mislead.  For example, in his discussion of malpractice, Gladwell urges his patients to find their doctors \\"wanting\\" if they appear not to be listening or talking down.  But the research on which Gladwell bases his malpractice discussion simply found a correlation between this sort of behavior and a physician's likelihood of being sued.  There was no discussion of whether the physicians who were sued more frequently when this sort of behavior was present also had delivered less appropriate care with any greater frequency.  While many of us would prefer a doctor who takes the time to listen, we also want a competent doctor.  Would it necessarily be wise to pass up a doctor with an excellent clinical reputation simply because he/she was a cold fish?  In a discussion about hospital emergency departments, Gladwell asserts that \\"what screws up doctors when they are trying to predict heart attacks is that they take too much information into account.\\"  He bases this conclusion on research performed in the 1970s that produced an algorithm for determining heart attacks that considered far less data than traditional methods of diagnosis and was far more accurate and safe.  What seems obvious, however, is that the algorithm worked better not because it required less information but rather because it had identified the right information to use.  And the algorithm had been developed after only \\"feeding hundreds of cases into a computer\\", so there also appears to have been nothing intuitive about which data would prove to be the best data to use in assessing the likelihood of heart attack.  Gladwell ends his Afterword with the suggestion that, given the demonstrated bias against black defendants in criminal trials, \\"the accused shouldn't be in the courtroom\\" and \\"should answer all questions by e-mail or through the use of an intermediary.\\"  In this manner, the jury's and judge's bias would be mitigated.  Constitutional issues aside, if juries and judges are on average (at least unconsciously) biased against black defendants, why shouldn't those same biases affect jury and judge perceptions of black witnesses?  Do we also need to remove all witnesses from the courtroom?  But after having removed all witnesses and defendants from the courtroom, how much potentially valuable information is lost by the inability to view witness and defendant (if the defendant chooses to take the stand) facial and body language of the sort that Gladwell earlier in the book asserts is so meaningful?  Has one type of injustice been \\"solved\\" in exchange for creating the possibility of many more?  My gut tells me that figuring out how to remedy courtroom racial bias is going to require more thinking than blinking.
B000001DQG|4.0|This is a flawed classic from Eltons golden period when he was selling more records than anybody else on the planet. There are a some all-time classic Elton tracks in the \\"The Bitch is Back\\" and \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" as well as \\"Pinball Wizard\\", which is a extra track on this CD.<br /><br />The main difference with this album over say his other classic albums of the 70's is the addition of the Tower of Power horn section. This adds some umph to the whole proceedings. So very average Elton songs like \\"Your so Static\\" and \\"Stinker\\" (both of which I love) become much funkier affairs.<br /><br />Overall then this is an underrated album, that whilst not quite as good as GYBR or Tumbleweed Connection, is far better than its given credit for.

B00002MZ4W|2.0|Along with [[ASIN:B000002IT2 Tori Amos]], Fiona Apple repopularised the piano as a rock instrument in the 1990s amidst a stream of annoying grunge and techno. Influenced by long-forgotten 1970s albums like [[ASIN:B000000132 Turn of the Cards]], Tori's first two albums were exceptionally personal and melodic works that for me as a first- and second-year student of Melbourne University, became beacons of hope in a musical landscape that seemed to be deteriorating all the time.<br /><br />When she first emerged in 1996 with [[ASIN:B000002BE9 Tidal]], I thought (oddly) Fiona Apple was from my native Australia and she seemed interesting enough that I bought \\"When The Pawn\\" almost as soon as it came out despite not being pleased with the new direction she seemed to be taking. With hindsight, I feel at present that my judgement has been vindicated. Just as Tori tried some quite silly experiments on [[ASIN:B000002J88 her third album]], on \\"When the Pawn\\" Apple is trying to be a \\"twisted\\" rocker. In the process, both her voice and piano lose out. What is undoubtedly meant to be eerie soundscapes on most tracks on \\"When the Pawn\\" tend to come off as half-hearted, notably on the opening two tracks. In other parts of the album, Apple simply comes off as tuneless.<br /><br />With the exception of \\"Fast As You Can\\", which really does pull off the trick of being utterly creepy, none of \\"When The Pawn\\"'s songs have a really memorable line or lyric: instead, they sound like [[ASIN:B00000DGUG Alanis Morrisette]] trying to be an art-rock singer. The lyrics, too, tend to be too much of the angsty, [[ASIN:B0000AZKDL Melissa Etheridge]]-style \\"wronged lover\\" school to really be effective: there is not nearly enough personal reflection or serious storytelling.<br /><br />All in all, if you want to see a record that is truly \\"pretentious\\" whilst not achieving much, you've come to the right place. Stick with Tori's first two albums if you want some really genuine piano rock, though.
1595141979|5.0|I can't tell you how much I loved and hated this book. This series has been the best when it comes to connectivity to the characters. I can easily connect to Rose and the loyalty she has to her best friend. But, I agree with the others when saying it is such a sad book. I hated the ending, but I believe it was for the best. It will change the direction of the whole series and its about time Rose gets the limelight, but I hate that she has to hurt people in the process. I couldn't believe my eyes when the tragedy happened. I thought this couldn't be true. And I felt the same when Rose said a little part of her soul died that day. Thats how I felt. After reading I was soooo emotionally and physically drained, by a book no less. It's such a good turn for the series and is well worth the read. I just wish the next one would hurry up because I need some kind of closure, it's making me go insane having to wait. Richelle Mead is such a great writer; I really hope her next book comes out soon!

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|What a wonderful experience to see the movie, listen to the sound track and just feel wonderful everytime.  Besides the story and music, it was absolutely trementdous to see actors acting their age and not everyone was a small size - just full of people being normal. Hurray!  Can't wait for the Dvd.
0312427999|5.0|I have known, for a long time that we were not the guys in the white hats, but this book is a true eye opener.It is as horrifying as it informative.  It should be required reading for all high school students in order that they not be lulled into the compacency of their parents generation.
B0017U7PT6|1.0|I am pretty open to all types of movies and I even liked Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. This movie is so laden with WTFs it can't even be called entertaining. It would do much better as a comedy but the stage is set for a serious production.   The opens in a snowy land where the guys are too stupid to wear shirts and coat themselves with mud. The girls though have been smart enough to invent bras. They also invented mascara, eyeliner, rouge and lipstick and in the beginning of the movie they have apparently been working under cars as they are greasy smudged as opposed to the mud smeared men.  \\"Native\\" dialects soon give way to strong modern accents including more than a few who have apparently invented British inflections and the 'broken' language of 'primitives' becomes intermixed with complete grammatically correct sentences bearing $10 words.   I love the part where our hero falls into a pit trap containing a Saber-toothed tiger who apparently fell in, recovered the hole then pinned himself under a log so he couldn't move.  I still can't figure out the reasoning behind stampeding the mammoths and chasing them miles for a kill. I would have dropped one where he stood grazing so I wouldn't have to carry it all so far back home, I guess I'm just a spoiled lazy movie buff.    The graphics were excellent but the writing and directing were pathetic. Quest For Fire gets my vote hands down.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|Based on a true story, \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" features Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a struggling San Francisco medical equipment salesman beset with financial problems.  Tired of the struggle, his wife moves out and leaves him with their little boy.  As they spiral down the financial shaft, they are reduced to sleeping in homeless shelters and in subway bathrooms.      Gardner lands an unpaid internship to become a Dean Witter stockbroker.  Juggling the demands of fatherhood, keeping financial wolves at bay, selling his remaining inventory of bone density scanners and cracking the books to become a broker, Smith's character pursues his vision like one who has run out of alternatives.    Yes, it's a bit hokey and at times requires you to swallow the implausible, but this is an uplifting film that can inspire you to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals.
0143038419|2.0|I picked up Eat, Pray and Love several times in the bookshops since it was published in 2006. I put it down. Several friends asked me: have you read the book?  I hadn't.  Finally, at the bookshop a few weeks ago a friend asked, you haven't read it?  Let me get it for you.  OK, I said.  I finished reading it a few days ago.  It reminded me Sarah McDonald's Holy Cow.  Written in a breezy style, I felt it lacked depth.  However, I was empathetic with the Gilbert's need to do what she as doing and needed to heal. The strengh of the book is that Gilbert does carry out her dreams and helps herself.  Many women I know have this need, but not the courage to cary it out.  For those I think the books is inspirational.  It talks of following your heart and geting in touch wiht your heart.

The Dr. Manhattan character embodies the unholy power of nuclear weapons in a frighteningly cold persona. This is really a stand alone work of comic fiction, any Sci-Fi or comic fan should own this one. Can't wait for the movie, hopefully it does it justice!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Wow! This set of DVDs is overflowing with breath-takingly beautiful photography shown in such stunning clarity in Blu-ray that it will blow your socks off! One question that was frequently asked as we viewed various scenes was \\"now how did they get that shot?\\".<br /><br />The narration by Sir David Attenborough is excellent, very informative, and pleasant to listen to. The scenery of this set offers views of our planet that is absolutely astounding, shot from land, sea, under water, air and space. The episodes were so enjoyable that when one would end we wanted to watch another, and another, and another.<br /><br />No doubt that in my home, this series will be watched many times for years to come. I was concerned about the price at first, but the set has proven itself to be well worth the cost! In fact I'm planning to send this set to family members as a gift.<br /><br />I'd give this more than 5 stars if possible... it's that good!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was recommended by a former boss. I quickly dubbed it 'Space Cowboys', and didn't expect to like it. However, I ended up buying the series. The characters are all interesting, the episodes are thoughtful. I especially liked the backdrop mix of languages and cultures. It's a shame this series was canceled.
1433502429|5.0|Many others have reviewed the ESV Study Bible, so I will keep my review brief, as the other reviews have covered so many aspects of the Bible that I hardly need to add my effort.  I have given the ESV Study Bible 5 stars.  It is a fantastic product from Crossway.  The ESV translation needs little comment.  It is a word-for-word translation and I never thought I would prefer any translation over the NASB but I do.  The ESV has clarity, beauty and is easy for memorisation.  The page layout is excellent.  I do not find the text too small - though I do need my reading glasses.  There is no red letter text.  I'm not sure if that was mentioned by any other reviewer.  I bought two - the TruTone Black and the Calfskin Leather.  One reviewer was disappointed in the Calfskin Leather product but I was not. The leather is supple and the product appears sturdy and well made.  There are two ribbon markers on this product.  However, for those looking for value for money, please consider the TruTone version.  It is excellent.  Looks beautiful; the leatherlike cover has a gentle polished effect, which adds to its appearance.  The interior of both versions is identical and the workmanship on the TruTone appears as professional as that on the Calfskin Leather version.  Many TruTone Bibles fall short of their leather cousins but in this case Crossway has produced a TruTone Bible which looks, feels, reads and is made in a way which I believe makes it a viable alternative to the Genuine Leather or Calfskin Leather versions - at a much lower cost.  I was thrilled when I unwrapped my TruTone Bible - and if you are looking to buy an ESV Study Bible which will last, looks great and yet you may not want to pay the higher price for the Leather versions - this is the one!

I bought the album immediately, and was not disappointed. This is one of the best and most innovative titles I have heard in a while.    Alcest's lead artist, Neige, released one album before this, which was classic melancholic black metal (also recommended). It was really surprising to see the artist make the switch in style, using the powerful melancholy of black metal with an uplifting theme of childhood dreams.

B001H5X7I4|4.0|TROPIC THUNDER is finally Ben Stiller's moment to rise out of the ashes of bad comedy. Here he has virtually redeemed himself as a funny person. It is evident he put a lot of passion and thought into this film, backed by a huge budget, which, without the big budget, this film would have lost its meaning.<br /><br />Although I believe that Stiller has almost redeemed himself, he is still a crappy actor, and as a comedian himself, he is never funny as he over plays his roles where he is just a caricature of himself.<br /><br />There are 2 real gems in this film, and neither of them are comedians: Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. Downey Jr as the black man in the film takes his role so seriously, that to not believe him would mean you did not enjoy the film. His mannerisms and tonality throughout is spot on, that you could not help laugh at everything he does. Just hilarious! Tom Cruise takes his role to new levels. He can sink into a few bad films - and they are bad because he takes his roles too seriously. This looked like he was having tons of fun playing Les Grossman is so over the top that you have to be in awe of his acting range. But his exaggeration is pitch perfect! I don't know anyone else who could have done it better. Watch him dance!<br /><br />Jack Black, the second billing of the movie, I felt his talents were completely wasted. Which is too bad. Of all the big names in this film, the chemistry seemed to work so well. Black was definitely working well with the group, but his role was of little ultimate use and his comedy was marred by his drug addicted character. I dont feel it was necessary and it was not really funny. Because he was fixated on drugs, it seemed he had no other relationship with the people and so the humor was reduced to base biological cliches.<br /><br />Two other honorable mentions of course is Jay Baruchel, who is a great geeky type person who fits perfectly as the scared young kid, but provides the sanity for the group of egotistical big named actors working together. And Brandon Jackson as 'Alpo Chino'. What a great name. And I loved his commercials in the beginning of the flick for 'Bust'a'Nut' energy bar. Awesome stuff!<br /><br />TROPIC THUNDER was written by Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux (Mulholland Drive) and together they have written a great comedy that can offer repeated viewings. I gave the film 4 stars because of some minor issues I had with the film, namely Stiller. His career, I think, would serve him so much better out of the way of the camera, and instead, stepping back to write and direct. His serious and always angry style that is so prevalent in just about every comedy is way overdone and was never funny to begin with because he could never write well enough for himself. When he did write for himself, it was usually an inflated role that served himself and not the film. So I say, step out of the way Ben, you are not the star.<br /><br />In sum, the film is definitely recommended to all. Yeah, there is lots of swearing and even some gore in the beginning. The racial issues are all part of the comedy and should not be taken seriously.<br /><br />Other celebrities who makes their way into the film are Matthew McConaughey, Christine Taylor (naturally, Ben Stiller's wife), Nick Nolte, and a lot of celebs who play themselves. Just a great, fun film that will keep you laughing for the entire ride!gether. And Brandon Jackson as 'Alpo Chino'. What a great name.

B001D08SK0|5.0|Much has been said about the Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue.\\" The album is the  subject of two books and any Miles Davis bio worth picking up devotes several pages to it's development and musical importance. The record is known for its simplicity and improvisation, as the sextet of jazz masters use a minimum amount of chords to create a mood that's profound, yet accessible. The original album consists of five tracks recorded in two days. Now, a half a century after its creation, there's a lot more.    The musical paleontologists at Epic/Legacy have given this superior work the full treatment, expanding the music onto two CDs, with more Miles on a DVD, which includes a documentary on album and a rare television appearance of Miles and his band, from 1960. The box set also includes four essays, session transcripts and a 60-page book.     The documentary, which is described as \\"newly produced,\\" obviously isn't a recent as you might expect, as the late Ed Bradley comments on the influence of the album along with Bill Cosby, Herbie Hancock, Carlos Santanna and Q-Tip. The late Jackie McClean also it appears, making this the only element of this reissue of a 1958 record that could be called dated. A rare television appearance of Miles and the band is also included, catching Miles in his prime, living up to his legend even when he's smoking cigarettes in the background as his band plays.    The songs on  \\"Kind Of Blue\\" were believed by many to have been recorded in one take, but among the \\"new\\" music is an alternate take of \\"Flamenco Sketches,\\" along with shorter versions of album's five tracks and one false start. Jazz nerds are given further insight into the recording process through the brief dialogues between Davis and the record's producer and engineer, between the takes. This banter is transcribed and followed by analysis in the accompanying book. On the second disc is another session with the same musicians, which were first released together in 2000, and a 17 minute live version of the album's opener \\"So What.\\"    The voluminous criticism, discussion and the additions to this essential album threaten to overwhelm a work known for it's lack of complexity. The music authorities may have tried to drown the public with data and transcriptions, but they've provided the ultimate life preserver in the box set: A 180-gram blue vinyl version of the album. - Craig Belcher
B001DHXT1G|5.0|This version of the Hulk was fantastic! This is the kind of movie you have to watch on blu-ray.  This version goes back to the television series and even adds the sad travleing song Dr. Bruce Banner (he was David on TV) endured everytime he hit the road.      Edward Norton takes over for Eric Bana.  This version is not a sequal and should not be taken as one.  It has a different direction and gives us a real bad guy we can follow played by Tim Roth who turns into Abomination.    Also, watch closely for hints for future villians and the set up for The Avengers.

B001GQACGO|2.0|Beyonce said in a recent interview that she would like to do a Broadway show.  Apparently she is already practicing, because all of the songs on the \\"I Am\\" CD sound like Broadway productions.  Seriously, can't you imagine watching a play in which JayZ breaks Beyonce's heart and she steps to the middle of the stage and breaks out into \\"If I Were A Boy\\".  The rest of the songs on \\"I Am\\" have the same flavor.  They're not bad, but they're not what  I expected from Beyonce, and thus, a disappointment.  The songs on the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" CD are just, well, bad.  Again, it's not what I expected from Beyonce.  And to add to the situation of the songs not being that great, the sound - at least of the CD that I got - was of poor quality.  The vocals were muffled and the thump-thump-thump of the bass drum almost drowned out the muffled vocals as well as the rest of the instruments.  Sorry, B, I love you but this CD set only gets two stars.

B00005JNJV|5.0|I have doubts this movie (or its sequels) fit in with Warner Brother's previous Batman series of movies (though there are some similarities).  I also doubt it fits in with the TV series (which has far fewer similarities).<br /><br />If there is a weak link, it is the time spent on the origins development.  The comic books give the impression that Bruce Wayne trained after his parents' murder getting physically prepared for his role as Batman.  The TV series didn't deal with the subject at all and the movie series barely touched on it.  (The excellent animated series did deal with the subject to a small extent.)  This movie dealt more with it, with some similarities to the Matrix in the process.<br /><br />I will admit I had to adjust to Michael Caine in the role of Alfred.  Of course Caine did a great job with the role -- we're talking about Michael Caine, after all -- but looks wise he did not fit my image of the role.  Christian Bale did as good as anybody as Bruce Wayne, though Michael Keaton was my favorite Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />One major difference is the description of Chill, who orphaned Bruce Wayne.  This movie made him believable as a thug, and not as cold-blooded as the comic book crook or the pre-Joker Jack Napier of the previous series (both of which contemplated killing the boy, which Chill did not).  I won't touch any more of the story to keep from spoiling it any further.<br /><br />The one interesting thing was that it showed Jim Gordon in his pre-commissioner days.  It developed the relationship between Gordon and Batman that was basically ignored in the previous movie series and taken for granted in the TV series.  Another interesting thing was the insertion of the comic book/animated series villain Scarecrow as a minor villain.<br /><br />In short, the acting was great -- in addition to Caine there are great performances by Liam Neeson (who I didn't recognize), Rutger Hauer, and Morgan Freeman.  The action started slow but ended up on pace.  The special effects were more spectacular than in the previous movies.  I probably would not take children nine or under (an arbitrary age) to see it, and would accompany any minor before seeing it.  To me, though, there seemed to be less sex than in the previous series, which was a plus to me.<br /><br />This ended with a minor cliff-hanger (the introduction of the Joker, another sign of independence from the previous movie series), enough to whet a person's appetite for \\"The Dark Knight\\", but not enough to keep them from sleep.than in the previous movies.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|Right to the details...<br /><br />^+++ The Pros +++^<br />+ Lightweight, easy to carry around<br />+ While the brushes are spinning, the sweeper feels like it's gliding and nearly weightless on the floor.<br />+ Well balanced (battery is at a little past 1/2 way down the handle to counter-balance the weight of the sweeper<br />+ Low profile, swivel design makes it a champ for getting easily under furniture and into tough areas<br />+ Excellent at getting into the corners<br />+ Comes with a hair/tangle cutting tool<br />+ The rotating brush design does double duty; rotation of the brushes pulls the debris into the sweeper for collection and at the same does some light duty brush-up on the floor to loosen some items up for collectionx<br /><br />^--- The Cons ---^<br />- The battery is made up of 6 X AA rechargeable batteries inside and the charger charges at 200mA. If the charge time is rated at 6-8hours that makes the capacity at something around 1500mAH. Not exactly the highest capacity batteries available.<br />- Also, the 200mA charger isn't a \\"smart\\" charger, it doesn't automatically turn off when the batteries are charged (hence the warning in the manuals that the batteries shouldn't be left on the charger for 24hrs or more)<br />- While it does an excellent job on hardwood, the Swivel Sweeper is nearly worthless on carpeted areas.<br /><br />*** Conclusion ***<br />If you're a pet owner and have hardwood floors then you're likely familiar with the \\"tumbleweeds\\" of fur that no matter how often you vacuum or use the brush for, they just keep showing back up (ahhh, what a joy being a pet owner can be sometimes huh?).<br /><br />Especially frustrating is trying to keep up with cleaning the areas under the furniture, on the stairs and in the corners. Our Dyson vacuum has great suction, but it's a hassle for doing light work or getting at stuff under the furniture. The broom is good for getting into corners but then you're always bending down to scoop up the dirt, which the dustbin never fully is able to pick up all the fine dirt. Not to mention it's no good at getting under the furniture.<br /><br />We've also tried the hybrid broom/vacuum, but it was essentially the worst of both worlds. It was inept at getting under furniture and the suction power was weak.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweeper turned out to be fantastic (on hardwood). There's no suction to it, instead, the rotation of the brushes pulls all the dust/dirt/hair into the collection chamber. Kind of like why you'd want mud flaps on your car because while the wheels are turning all the mud, snow, rocks and such are kicked up against the car body.<br /><br />Along with the \\"kick-up\\" collection method, the swivel head allows for the sweeper to literally be used at a 180degree angle. Which makes getting under furniture an absolutely menial task and you can get the sweeper as far under furniture as you can reach your arm!<br /><br />I should stress again that this is all on hardwood, the couple of times I tried using the sweeper on carpet the brushes could never spin up to full speed so the \\"kick-up\\" power was diminished and since the brushes had to work that much harder, the battery doesn't last nearly as long.<br /><br />If you have hardwood floors and especially if you have pets that produce fur tumbleweeds like we do, then I wholeheartedly suggest this Swivel Sweeper!Not to mention it's no good at getting under the furniture.

1576754227|5.0|The analogy here is to identify a task you are putting off as \\"eating a frog\\" and Brian Tracy sums it up nicely when he identifies in the introduction, 2 rules about eating frogs. 1) If you have to eat more than one frog, eat the ugliest one first. 2) When you have to eat a frog, it's best not to look at it or think about for too long, just get it over with. As the subtitle to EAT THAT FROG suggests, you'll learn 21 Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time.<br /><br />Some might say there is nothing new here, and they would be correct. However Brian Tracy has a special touch when it comes to reminding us of things we already know, but fail to use. He gives us easy to follow advice and shows us ways to take action. In today's fast paced world of business, time management is more critical than ever before and Tracy will shows you ways to cut hours out of your day.<br /><br />Each chapter is concluded with action steps that will help you implement what you have learned, right away. This is a quick and easy read, so there is no reason to procrastinate. So go ahead, eat that frog, now!
B00004RFFS|5.0|You will really enjoy this movie!    Great acting, fun, funny and incredibly horrific!    If you are a fan of Anne Rice's, this movie is for you!     Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt have great chemistry together.    Sit back and enjoy!
0691131511|5.0|I bought this book, Byzantium, by Judith Herrin as I had been advised to read it before visiting the excellent exhibition at the Royal Academy in London. Judith gives a great deal to readers: like the builders mentioned at the start, I had little idea of Byzantium or what byzantine art was about. She writes a clear historical and often witty account of Constantinople through its Christian era from the 4th to the 15th centuary. This beautiful city is described in detail and one follows with excitement the lives of the emperors, their religious beliefs, belief in the power of icons,their disagreements with Rome, the expanding and contracting empire, the disaster of the Fourth Crusade and the final sacking by the Turks. Her scholarship is indisputable but her easy use of the English language and prose makes the book a delight to read.
B001GQACGO|2.0|I am a Beyonce fan...scratch that..WAS. This was a complete downgrade from her past efforts. The majority of the songs were very bland and all too similar..especially the Beyonce disc while the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" was filled with a lot of songs with strong beats and lackluster substance. I could go and on but I'd rather you see for yourself. Preview the album before handing over your$9.99 or $12.99. I don't understand the purpose of putting out two cds. I mean who wouldn't buy the Deluxe and not the Standard. Come on now. Its obvious this was simply a ploy to make more money. Certainly not off of me.     Enjoy...HA!
1596434252|5.0|Fantastic Pop-Up book!  Probably the most creative and imaginative pop-up book I've ever experienced, with a wide variety of \\"pop-ups\\" and other mechanics.  A real treat to own...and share with others.
B0013ND30M|5.0|One of the best and my favorite Disney movies.<br />Great to watch over and over.
B000QUU4OQ|2.0|I enjoyed Emma very much...BUT...    As far as Shakespeare in Love--I was very disappointed to find an \\"R\\" rated movie packaged with Emma...The nude scenes and the Sex scenes were not necessary to the storyline and were vulgar.
B00004YB9Y|2.0|Most great artist have recorded a \\"stinker\\" album and for the Three Tenors, this is the one.  The album suffers from the lack of a good producer - someone to say \\"Ah...guys, lets try that one again,\\" and \\"Do you really want to sing Winter Wonderland?\\"  There are sloppy entrances, one or two flat notes, and some really bad song choices.  With all the great Christmas music available, why did anyone think that it was a good idea for these particular singers to sing \\"Sleigh Ride?\\"  However, as another reviewer noted, their rendition is good for a giggle or two.  Unless you are a completist, don't waste your money.  Pavarotti and Domingo have both recorded wonderful Christmas albums.  Buy those!
B001KQIAXM|5.0|suprisingly good album!      I recommend all of Disc I, and from Disc II: radio, vidoe phone, smash into you, and that's why you're beautiful (very pretty)    it's worth paying the $3 extra for the deluxe ablbum    good album Beyoncé!
1400032717|2.0|I'm surprised by the glowing reviews this book got. I really thought it was a terrible diservice to \\"aspie\\" people. The boy seems to not care about anyone and the adults in this book are all totally screwed up. I don't like the connection that people are bound to make that the parents of children with autism can't handle the complex life they have been given. While well written in a literary sense, this book leaves you sad and feeling as though people are truly pathetic. Not a good read at all and not at all a true vision of what autism really looks like.
B000059XUP|4.0|This movie is really good.  However, it tries to hard to be like the original Crow.  The similarities make it feel more like a remake than a sequel.  For an interesting twist and a good solid sequel you should buy; \\"The Crow; Salvation\\".  But if you are like me and you want the whole collection it is still a good watch.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I love this movie so much. I used to watch it at my grandmothers house when i was a child although i am only 23 years old and i still love it. I have wanted to own this for a long time and I hope to one day share it with my children. The whole aspect of the movie is relaxing and exciting at the same time i think it lets your emmotions take hold because your not concentrating on language more so just reactions and activities that are going on. It's fantasy like and a wonderful story.
B001DELX08|5.0|I was very impressed by this version. From the first minutes you understand that new era of high quality video has already become. The image is so three-D-mentional that it's even hard to see something similar in our every-day reality. Modern HD-cameras create the effect of physical presence in the scene. I saw this blu-ray at 52\\" plazma TV, and I felt that I'm in the scene, even can touch any object. It reminds me of my experience in IMAX-theaters.     Take into mind that creators of this production use plenty of luxury fabrics, authentic props and similiar things, and in the whole pay much attention to detailes of scenery. The ball scenes are truly of royal range.     The image of these materials has high contrast, deep colours, well-shaped textures of everything, shine of jewellery strikes your eyes, but little pity for singers and actors: you can see all their skin defects.    Quality of audio is also the same as they noted in features of blu-ray disc. Often in my blu-ray experience I face the problem that producers of so-called blu-ray discs just sell old recordings with standard audio-video quality on blu-rays without any improvements! Here all is real blu-ray quality.      I have already saw some operas on blu-rays, and think this is THE BEST!
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|46 years, and who would have thought James Bond would have made it this far? We've gone through 6 different actors- Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig.<br /><br />Casino Royale was one of my favorite 007 movies- Daniel Craig sure puts Brosnan to shame. He definitely gives the darker feel to 007. He did so in Casino Royale, and does the same here. Sure he ain't Sean Connery, but he definitely is a great Bond.<br /><br />Now this one starts an hour after Casino Royale's ending. Bond is Vengeful, dspite Vesper having betrayed him in the last film. He is not himself and has yet his biggest challenge- Dominic Greene, an eco-power enviromentalist, who's planning to drain all of Bolivia's water supply. Along the way he meets a hot Russian chick named Camille, who is the only one who contains information about GREENE and the company QUANTUM, requiring him to put himself ahead of MI6, M, and everything else to unravel Greene's secret sinister plan and stop it... even if it means his life.<br /><br />THis film is amazing. Sure it's a bit slower than Casino Royale but it still does have great action in it, and even a cool opening credits scene. Oh, and the action scene towards the ending with the explosions and the collapsing floors was AWESOME!!!!<br /><br />Anyways, if you're a Bond fan, DO see this. Lower your expectations and have a blast!
B000FA5Q5E|5.0|After reading the first 2 books by Nicholas I figured I would go in order of how they were written and \\"A WALK\\" being the 3RD.  It was was heart breaker, Jamie was the preacher daughter and where ever she went she took her bible. Landon was a troubled teenager, who after a play and going to the orphanage falls in love with Jamie.  When she tells him she is sick, he is heartbroken.  I had tears in the eyes for a while in some of the chapters.  At the end you never really know if Jamie dies or not from being sick, you have to use your heart to figure it out.
B00004RF8J|4.0|I recently ordered the DVD Little Shop of Horrors.  It is one of my favorite movies and I only had it on VHS. I was glad to find it on DVD. I am pleased with the quality of the product and I'm also pleased with the shipper.
B001AQMBMS|1.0|This is so BS!........MGM's Usual Suspects and Robocop was barebones release and now is Ronin.  These are great titles, but are being treated with no respect (clearly double dipping)!!!!!!    Whoever is making these types of decisions clearly needs to be replaced because they do not know how to market a new medium that is striving to break through to the masses!    Oh yea, and Universal needs to stop butchering their documentaries and leave them intact!..... \\"The Thing\\" gone is that 80 min Doc!, broken up as U-control.
B001GJ3VYG|5.0|For me, Dido is all about the voice. In a world of identical voices, hers sticks out. That is what drew me to her music initially, and it is why I continue to enjoy every minute of music she produces.    The instruments she uses, the ambience, the electronica etc. is just window dressing. The voice is almost otherworldly, the emotion coursing through it is so real. It takes me back to a certain time in my life, when I was stationed in Japan. I put her CD on and drove up and down Okinawa. Relaxing, intense, amazing.    Thanks for another great record, Dido.
B0012OVF2U|5.0|Excellent quality CD. Duffy rocks on this CD and I have enjoyed listening many times since I received it. It did take a long time to receive the CD and I became impatient but now its like glue and will not leave my hands! Will be watching for more releases from this talented artist. Thanx AMAZON!
B0018QCXH8|1.0|This movie sucked, yeah I said it. For all those people out there who think I'm stupid, so what, doesn't change the fact that this movie was awful. Rent it or download it if you just have to see it but for god's sake don't buy it! You will be stuck with a movie that you spent all that money on and you may only watch once, twice if you wanna remind yourself how big a mistake it was buying. The only reason this movie should be considered epic is because it takes an eternity to watch. This is a propaganda movie showing you how evil the oil industry is, and thats it.
B0007RT9LW|3.0|OK, neither of these movies are the deep, moving, cinematic masterpieces that Halicki and Cage are both otherwise known for (are you kidding me?)<br /><br />This is a car flick, period. My interest is purely my inner 14-year-old's car nuttiness coupled with my (now 36 yr old's) appreciation for awesome Mustangs; and Eleanor is one awesome hunk of steel (either the 1973 mach I OR the 1967 GT 500)<br /><br />So it ain't \\"Shakespeare\\" as another reviewer said, it ain't supposed to be. You don't go to a strip bar looking for fine wine or to Six Flags  in search of the ultimate metaphysical meaning of life (or maybe you do, i ain't yer momma)<br /><br />The reason I'm chiming in here, though, is because the reviews that have been voted to the top are for Halicki's ORIGINAL movie, shot in the early 70's (or, the remastered DVD that came out a few years ago)... NOT THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE is the 2000 remake with Nick Cage and Angelina Jolie. Actually, this DVD is the director's cut of that movie released in 2005.<br /><br />Cage and Jolie would have had a hard time stealing tricycles in 1973, when those reviewers saw the movie they are talking about. The shocking thing is enough idiots rated these wrong reveiws all the way to the top, without anyone catching the fact that they were talking about a different flick.<br /><br />On an unrelated note: It really bothered me when Stephen Speilberg and Tom Cruise caused that panic in 1938 with their \\"War of the Worlds\\" radio play. I bet it really ticked off President Taft and the Roman Empire.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I think the movie is cheesy but I like the message behind the movie. It's about human endurance and individualistic side of mankind. I don't think Rocky movies are of any importance in terms of artistic value or theme but it is a great way of showing how people fight for their freedom, honor and how they endure harsh situations to achieve these. Oh btw, the sound track is now a classic. Good movies!
B001DJ7PN2|5.0|This film is one that requires the watcher to immerse oneself in another world. A world of cold war tensions, clandestine operations, high level plants and communist witch hunts. Historical facts not with standing, it is a very enjoyable film and is very well done. The pacing and character development is second to none. The movie is star studded and the talent of those present is easily recognizable.   It does not have 21 cars exploding, bullet time kung fu or little kids out smarting adults, so I suspect the general public of subhuman idiots that is today's movie watcher may complain that it's boring.   I highly recommend it
B0013FSL3E|3.0|I loved this and I think it's a unique and great story. I just don't get the whole anti-human message that Disney has displayed in the past in its cartoons (finding Nemo, Wall-E....). Do they really hate human beings? The movie is extremely well-done but for its anti-mankind message I can't give it any better rating.
B001KYP55A|5.0|This is another great cd from taylor swift she is an amazing songwriter and singer. It's a great cd but some of the songs sound the same but that does not take away from the cd at all it's great. My 2 favorite tracks on this album are fifteen and the best day. It's a great cd and the dvd is really good too. A must buy if you have the first cd or just like any of taylor's music.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|It is worth the money.  If you are use to looking at the cartoon Hulk.  You will not be disapointed.
0195067142|5.0|This is one of the most intimate and exceptionally written books about combat I have every read.  Eugene Sledge portrays the war in the Pacific in such a way that you feel the pain and suffering of the men who sacrificed everything for eachother in combat.  You will be humbled by Sledge's memoirs.  A must read for all.
B000UR9T82|5.0|I, like everyone else already saw the films prior to this release.  Sometimes it takes me a while to watch films.  I bought this set when it was first released and all that I did was to preview them.  That is, I looked at the picture quality and sound quality.  They are both excellent!  I still have not watched them through on BD, but I saw enough to give the highest marks.    I only speak on BD quality, not the films.  If I must, then I would say that the Mary Jane being caputred and held as bait should not be the plot point for all three films, but it is.  In the comic books, Spiderman did not spend any where as much time with Mary Jane as in the movies.  She was hardly ever involved with exploits.  I hope that the next film reduces Mary Jane's role, does not have the villian holding a Gwen Stacey hostage as bait for Spiderman(it will kill the series), and it would not be a bad ideas to follow the comics and have Spidey battle non-traditional Spidey foes such as Dr. Doom, The Punisher (that would have been a good way to tie-in a NEW Punsiher film - think!) or the Leader.    This set is a must buy and is probably (along with Casino Royale and politics) why Blu Ray won the war.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I haven't been able to stop listening to this CD.  I love it!  It is perfect for a winter night.  Each song has the unique flavor only Sarah McLachlan can give.  Beware that The First Noel is pretty different, but it is awesome!  And I love her take on What Child is This and In The Bleak Mid Winter.  Very good CD.  I highly recomment it.
0780626966|5.0|As a big fan of horror in general it's nice to finally have THE definative collection of the Elm Street films that is pretty sweet. While it's true these movies do get progressively more campy and less scary they still hold the same interest they did when they were released.    I enjoyed this set, and the extras are very well done, plus at this price where else are you likely to get 7 flicks plus a bonus disk?     Well worth the cost...I may even get another to give as a gift!
B001FSDOZO|3.0|Okay, I know rockers love to party and have sex but do all of their songs have to be about that?  Their last few CD's were so much better and I am a disappointed fan.  I do like \\"If Today Were Your Last Day\\" and the one currently playing on the radio \\"Gotta be Somebody\\".      I'd like to be a rockstar for a day though....sex, drugs and rock and roll.
B001EOQWEO|2.0|The movie is good, but the DVD has problems.  VLC on a PC can't play it on my Vista based PC.  My Samsung HD931 can play the bonus features but not the movie.  The same for my XP-based PC (WMP - I'm not sure what DVD decoder).  It does work with the Mac OS X 10.5 DVD player application.
0812975219|5.0|This book is great and should be a compulsory reading for everyone at college. Lots of people do not realize how much chances and coincidences play roles in our lives. This book is about learning to appreciate the vast number of variables in common life which are not controlled by anyone.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|Was this movie \\"amazing\\" \\"fantastic\\" \\"invincible\\"...no it was INCREDIBLE.    Great reboot to the franchise, if you can even call it that.    Great respect shown to Bill Bixby...great job to Mr. Norton for bringing us a real hero movie.    Box office numbers don't always indicate the true impact that a movie has.    Many people have even said to me they enjoyed this even more than IRON MAN.    Bonus features are great.  Would have liked to have seen Norton's version that was chopped up...aside from the deleted scenes.    Blu Ray compared to dvd format...volume had to be lowered to 1/2 as to not shatter the windows.  Better on bluray even compared to seeing it in the theaters.
B001CQONKY|5.0|When you like the CSI series, this is of course a must to see. You won't be disappointed.
014241039X|5.0|My 5- and 7-year-old boys LOVED this story! Lots of great mischief. I never knew Roald Dahl beyond \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" \\"The Twits\\" is great for younger audiences. I can't wait to get more of his books.
1582701709|5.0|I love the book.  I start my day by reading a couple of pages to help me keep a positive outlook to guide me through the rest of my day.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|It's pointless to review music CDs as any other piece of arts because I have regretted buying many music CDs reading good reviews written by others as much as I have enjoyed watching movies that had very poor reviews.  If you loved previous Enya CDs, you know you'll get this one so don't bother reading any reviews.  Buying a piece of art is not like shopping for a car or looking for a vacation resort.  Taste is something you can't share with others; either you like it or you don't.  This is the same reason why you shouldn't pay attention what Zagat says about restaurants.    If you're already Enya's fan just get the CD; if you're new to her music I really hope you enjoy listening her sounds.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|If you like a classical music infused with rock and a bit of new age sound, you will love this dual CD.
B000069HZP|5.0|The product was received in excellent condition and the movie dvd was also in excellent condition.
B001GQSY64|1.0|Let me first start out by saying I am a 100% Star Wars fanboy. I own zero movies on DVD/Blu-Ray except for anything Star Wars.<br /><br />That being said, I thought that it was a good idea for Lucasfilm animation to release a movie to promote/kick-off the Cartoon Network series. This movie, however, was not their best effort.  I usually think everything that comes out of the Lucas camp is gold, but this one was way below average. A big miss people<br />Like other reviewers have stated, the story was very poor. I mean all the great writers from the expanded universe books and this is the best they can do?  I love the prequel era books. I have read too may to count. Almost all of them are just fantastic. They have great characters unlike Asoka. I want her gone now. The \\"Skyguy\\" nickname made me cringe. It was the worst.<br /><br />Enough about the bad, let's talk about the good. I have watched every episode of the Cartoon Network show on TV and it is just great. Why didn't they make the storyline for the movie like the series? They have the feel of Star Wars and I can't wait till they are released on Blu-Ray. Great job Lucasfilm animation on the network series. They are phenomenal. Now just collect all the remaining copies of the Clone Wars animated movie and bury them in the desert ala \\"E.T.\\" the game.<br />May we never speak of this again.
B00005JPO1|5.0|We went to the show to see this movie and loved it.  I couldn't wait to own the DVD so we could watch it again and again.  This movie had the feel of the other Indiana Jones movies, it was an action movie without taking itself too seriously.  If you didn't see this movie in a theater shame on you but buy the DVD and it will be money well spent and as far as I can remember there is nothing in the movie that would prohibit this from being a 'family' night movie.  A well done movie that everyone can enjoy.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This is a great album.  I'm so happy with it.   I'm a huge fan and I've been waiting for this since his performances on AI when, whether or not he was going to win, I signed up hook, line and sinker for anything he planned to deliver.   His win was just a bonus - and brings him to us that much faster and with more backing - unlike some other worthy contestants in years past who didn't get that benefit, and have to fight an uphill battle to come to us now!  I'm just so thrilled that the win this year was so dead on, so worthy, so unique.   And once he's free of the obligations of that win, David Cook is going to be able to really open up and be that one of a kind we saw on AI.   For now, this album completely satisfies!!  It's GREAT!
031606792X|3.0|SPOILER    If you want to complain about the whole pregnancy, why don't you read up on some vampire folklore. Renesmee is esentially a dhamphir. She is the child of a vampire father and human mother.    --    Breaking Dawn is not as bad as it sounds. This is a PERFECT book if you are the type that loves neatly wrapped happy endings. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people and like some loose ends and bittersweet endings.    It was interesting to say the least but the conflict was too easily overcome or perhaps too short. The book built up to this last conflict for so long that the conflict itself... was a disappointment.
160459201X|5.0|This book is very easy reading and very informative for the person who really wants to get in touch with the subconscious mind. It taught me alot of techhniques to use. This is a must have book for the people trying to take the learning of the secret to another level.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This is a movie you'll love at first viewing, and appreciate more and more each time you watch it. The extra features let you get inside the movie.
B001DHXT20|5.0|This is buy far as close to the comic book story as possible so far. the special effects were stunning. A must see.
B001GQO50I|1.0|Messrs Manzarek, Kreiger, Densmore and Jampol should be ashamed of their unethical claim that this release uses \\"first generation tapes\\".  It is nothing more than an official bootleg using disparate and subpar tapes when they in fact knew all along better quality (re: master) tapes existed and who possessed them.  Jim Morrison is rolling over in his grave at this cash grab!!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|After the huge succes that was \\"All The Right Reasons\\"(2005) you have to wonder how Nickelback or any band could continue and release another album without deceving anyone.I admire the band for not rushing to make another album after such a success,they just took their time and made sure the album was good before releasing it and in my opinion it was worth it.\\"Dark Horse\\" is released three years latter and after listening to it many times I can say that it's a really good album,I don't think it's their definitive album but I'd say that it's well worth it.I didn't think they could make something this good but they did,I didn't expect much of it so I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />  I have to say first that not a song here sucks,some are better and will be remembered more than others but I think they all have something that makes them each special and likeable.You get the heavy songs,the ballads,something to please everyone much like any Nickelback album.I like their previous album All The Right Reasons but I tought that they lost some of their edge present on earlier albums on that one.\\"Dark Horse\\" is similiar to it but it's less poppy and it's more edgy wich should still please both.The thing about this album is that it's a lot more sex oriented(songs like \\"Animals\\" and \\"Figured You Out were like that)with songs like \\"S.E.X\\",\\"Shakin'Hands\\" and \\"Something In Your Mouth\\" wich may offense you or may not.<br /><br />1. Something In Your Mouth : The opening track of the album is possibly my favourite,I love the energy,the riff great,everything on this track works 5.5/5<br /><br />2. Burn It To The Ground : Very strong song,strong energy pretty much like the song above,classic rock!5/5<br /><br />3. Gotta Be Somebody : The first single,good beat,I like lyrics a lot check them out.In the vein of their last album.5/5.<br /><br />4. I'd Come For You : A song that could have also been found on the previous album,not much to say about this one,it's a good one.The breakdown section was very well done.4/5<br /><br />5. Next Go Round : More sex-oriented song.\\"We're gonna do it hanging upside down\\" kinda thing wich gets lame after a while.3.5/5<br /><br />6. Just To Get High : A song about drug addiction, very catchy chorus and a strong message behind this one.5/5<br /><br />7. Never Gonna Be Alone : Great ballad,I predict this one will be a radio hit, reminescent of \\"Far Away\\",very good.5/5<br /><br />8. Shakin' Hands : I don't have much to say about this one.It's okay to me but there is much better on the album,good slow riff tought.3.5/5<br /><br />9. S.E.X. : Listen carefully to the chorus(and see review title for exemple),love the heavy riff,great song.Great little dirty song!5/5<br /><br />10. If Today Was Your Last Day : I think every band at one point of their career cover this subject so I've grown tired of it,the song itself is good but the subject's been overkilled.I don't really like this one.3.5/5<br /><br />11. This Afternoon : Very much a feel good kind of song,good for what it is but it's a little too happy for me.3/5<br /><br />  I think hiring producer \\"Mutt\\" Lange was a good idea,the result is a very good album.The band was very reserved and kept to a little group of people,by letting Lange in they made a good decision,at least it didn't hurt them.The songs are all good,I can listen to each of them,listen to the album fully trough and like it.<br /><br />  Of course there's always going to be people who say the band sucks and play the same stuff over and over again but that's not necessarily true,even if it is you're free to like what you want.Over the years the band's caught on quite a few fans and they're going to determine how sucessfull the album is going to be or how good it is,not some dude who says he doesn't like the band.I always liked the band because they sound sincere and seem to have something other bands out there today don't have.Their songs can be heavy or a ballad with great melody,yet it all works for this band and Chad Kroeger has a pleasant voice wich is one things most bands from today don't have in my opinion.<br /><br />  Nickelback made a terrific album with \\"Dark Horse\\" and judging by it's quality they still have some left in the tank and could still be around for years to come.I feel I will really enjoy for quite some time to come,in fact I already am.If you like Nickelback,especially ATRR then you should like this one too.don't have in my opinion.        Nickelback made a terrific album with \\"Dark Horse\\" and judging by it's quality they still have some left in the tank and could still be around for years to come.I feel I will really enjoy for quite some time to come,in fact I already am.If you like Nickelback,especially ATRR then you should like this one too.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I loved this movie.  I actually saw it twice in the theater.  Defiantely entertaining!    Bruma's Gift Shop  [...]
B001G5IJVK|3.0|Well, do we really need this ? For sure, that's a beautiful package, and as far as there's nothing new for years, like each and everytime there's this kind of compilation, I buy it just to heve the feeling to buy a new KISS record. Il you're not a die hard fan, you won't be interested, but if you're one you'll buy it just to have the satisfaction to have each and every record by your favorite nand : I'll name KISS.

B001GQACGE|1.0|Wow.  Never been a Beyonce fan, but enjoy Beyonce thoroughly, only when she is paired with intelligent, creative, and musical-minded producers (Swizz, Rich Harrison, Pharrell, Timbaland to a lesser extent.)  Her last album tricked me into thinking that B actually had a respectable musical mind...not.  Thanks to her producers, B-Day was a street album, almost a cult-sounding album, with inventive melodies, beats, and themes that appeal to true music heads.  Now enter I Am...Sasha Fierce.   When I saw the producer lineup about a month ago, I figured it would be hot garbage (Stargate, Amanda Ghost, Shondrae)?  But, off the strength of her last album, I took a chance anyway.  The best song, \\"Single Ladies\\" was co-produced by the awful \\"The Dream.\\"  The first disc on this album (splitting an 11-song album into a double?  Yet another sign to stay away) sounds like a half-dead Celine Dion album.  Clearly, she wants to expand to the 50-something sect who possess no ear for music whatsoever.  She probably plans on performing this disc in Vegas 20 years from now to maintain her lifestyle.  Throw in the second disc, with two songs similar in sound to Lil Wayne's \\"A Milli,\\" and you have not only the most dissapointing album in a long time, but a reason to kick yoursel in the behind because just by looking at the packaging and display of the album, to the double-disc format, to the lame alter-ego trip, to the sappy song titles, it looks like a waste of time and money.  Damn, B.  As a Black male, I love your style, intellect, and overall aura.  We still love you.  Always will.  But from this point forward, this Man will not respect your musicianship.  For the next album, don't feel too empowered to call real music people to pull the strings and make all the decisions as to how to use your voice.  You're too good to do MTV ballads.  Whatever money I lose selling this CD back, I will happily chalk up to self-punishment for making a ridiculous impulse purchase.  Maybe this album just wasn't made for me.  On the other hand, her little sister made an outstanding album.  Beyonce should have begged Produced Jack Splash for a few selections instead of no-names who frankly make nasty music.  If you haven't heard either of the Knowles latest albums, PLEASE take my word: You will enjoy Solange's Sol-Angel, you will loathe Sasha Fierce, unless you are a 16 year old girl from Nebraska who wakes and sleeps to MTV.  I shutter to think of the crap that's on the \\"Deluxe\\" disc.  Beyonce's new hair commercial is not backed by a selection off her new album for a huge press boom, but instead employs the incredible \\"I Decided\\" from her sister!  Even Beyonce's handlers know she made a dud!!  Beautiful pictures in the CD booklet, but they aren't worth $10, because that's all you get here.  There are millions of pics of this stunning lady on the internet for free.

B001GQACGE|1.0|She may changed her Holloywood name to Miss Fierce but nothing about this CD is fierce. I am a fan and usually like most of her music. The only song I liked was Single Ladies....The boring songs are dull and you will end up zoning out the music you are listening. I was amazed that she can even create crappy music this. I was very disappointed.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is a truly exceptional film both for its technical accomplishments, as well as for a story that is prescient. This film has all of the makings of a classic and I am quite confident it will be remembered as such.
0783240236|2.0|The Birds was the most ridiculous horror movie I've watched (and that includes The Evil Dead and other junk). Not only because of the lousy special effects - let's relegate those to the lack of technology. But the characters' reactions to the bird attacks often are preposterous. Let's pick the final scene when Miss Daniels hears a wing flutter and goes in the room at the top of the house, and see how many things are wrong with it:<br /><br />  1. Why would she go there?!<br />  2. Why, after peeking into the room and seeing it chock-full of birds, would she enter and...<br />  3. ... close the door behind her?<br />  4. Why then, when the birds start attacking, does she make all sorts of uncoordinated gestures instead of getting the hell out?<br />  5. Finally, her acting in that scene was just horrendous.<br /><br />Now, why is The Birds worth watching? For the 60s aura (listen to how word intonation used to be back then) and especially for the chemistry between the two lead characters. Mitch (Rod Taylor) is handsome in the movie, and he knows it; he knows that Miss Daniels is strongly attracted to him, and he calls her bluffs with masculinity and confidence. Their dialogue is humorous and witty, and the power play is well worth watching...<br /><br />...until about 1 hour and 10 minutes into the movie. After that, the birds march in, and the rest of the film is pretty much a waste of time. As philosophical food for thought, imagine a coordinated global ornithological conspiracy and how mankind would fight back - THAT'd be an interesting motion picture.
0060555661|5.0|Bought this book with an eye towards value stock picking.  I've read a few others, most notably Peter Lynch, and dabbled with a few thousand while keeping my savings in cash.    Graham and his commentators seem to have no agenda other than what's best for the investor.  Before I got to chapter 8 he had convinced me that individual stock picking was a waste of my time.  Dollar cost averaging into Index Funds and ETFs while they're cheap, balancing towards bonds when they're not; these are easy \\"set and forget\\" strategies and Graham has convinced me that they pay off.    I'll still buy a few individual stocks, just like I still like to shoot craps in Vegas.  Take a small amount and be willing to lose it.  For the rest of my savings I'll do the hardest thing for a \\"Defensive\\" Investor:  leave it alone.
0307269752|5.0|Everything I've read about this book by way of reviews is accurate. The most I can say is that I can't wait for the second book in the trilogy to be published. Larsson's death is a tremendous literary, as well as a humanitarian, loss.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I don't get why people are so hard on this movie. I guess it didn't live up to their expectations based on the previous movies. Well, I was never an Indiana fan and I never watched any of the previous movies. At least, not all the way through. So this was really my first movie to the series and I thought it was a lot of fun. The alien thing was kinda weird but it didn't stop me from liking the movie. So stop hating.
B00000DOYS|4.0|Obviously this itterance of Yes does not include Jon Anderson or Rick Wakeman. This allows Steve Howe and Chris Squire expand their songwriting chops. \\"Into the Lens\\" is a great example of a song that does not suffer without the Anderson Vocal style. \\"Tempus Fugit\\" is a great Steve Howe guitar riff.

0446581348|1.0|Was very diappointed in this book since I already own the others Bobbi has written.  No new information or techniques at all.  Bobbi seems to be stuck in a rut with both her technique and her own appearance.  And what is with the overly done blush on the models?  They look like they just got done running a marathon in the cold weather.  Wasted my money.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|Finally a good hulk movie!!!! I thought they would have to get big Lou Ferrigo back in the main role to get it done but this is the next best thing. And Edward Norton was great.
159102594X|4.0|Joe Abercrombie does a nice job with the first book of his First Law Series.  Setting the story in a well-built world and filling it with interesting, gritty characters creates a good balance of stage-setting and story-telling.<br /><br />The Blade Itself is told from the perspective of five-sic major characters who are gradually drawn together and who's collected experiences create a very interesting combination.  There is the mage, the apprentice, the barbarian, the gifted young noble, the crippled anti-hero....and so forth.  Very interesting characters for me.<br /><br />I think the only drawback that I saw in the series was that it take a while before things reach a boiling point and the story gets going.  That's not a serious drawback, but enough that it kept me from wanting to give it more than 4 stars.  Once the story gets going, then it's truly a lot of fun to read.<br /><br />Abercrombie's use of classic Fantasy themes is very good and his world building is exceptional.  I can't wait for the second book in the series.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|Make sure you get the 3cd edition. For the occasional AC/DC fan that should be enough. However for the hardcore fan this might not be enough. There are lots more great material out there, so AC/DCology 1, #2,#3...  Bring it on.......
0689865384|5.0|After recently getting back in touch with reading I have been searching for books to read. I started out with the Twilight saga and wanted to read more books that would entertain my imagination. Uglies did the trick. The book touches on a number of issues forcing the reader to contemplate them also. I liked it's commentary on self image. It definitely asserts that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that society dictates to us quite often what beauty is.   It is asserting that if we could look objectively at our surroundings we would be more likely to understand that sometimes what society is saying you should do may not actually be in your best interest.  I enjoyed watching Tally Young blood's character develop. Scott Westerfeld portrayed her very well. She is not some shiny wonderful hero. She is real with real mistakes and bad decisions, she feels shame about what she does and tries not to conceal her mistakes. Despite all the harm she causes she has the strength of character to try and make amends of her errors.   The book touches on the issues of friendship, betrayal, love, beauty, self image, bravery, environmental impact of humans, the nature of humans, evolution, being manipulated by society and much more. I think that this book is a great, thought provoking read with lots of action. I would highly recommend reading it.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|A Must Have For Any Eastwood Fan<br />Great extras with commentary from Rene Russo, John Malkovich, and Clint of course and interesting footage of real Secret Service agants<br /><br />The story of course is well known by this time to any Eastwood fan. This is one of Eastwood's best: a pretty good action thriller, lots of chases and shootouts but all connected inteligently so as not to insult the viewer. If you're an Eastwood fan you probably already have this or have seen it, so I won't waste a lot of time and energy describing the plot to you. Eastwood has put out a few duds in his time but this isn't one of them - this is well worth the money and I think you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Eastwood is an aging Secret Service agent on the trail of a potential assassin. Basically, his character, who is beginning to show signs of wear and tear gets a chance to redeem himself by tracking down a potential assassin. Pretty intense dialogue, some good fight scenes and even a little romance with Renee Russo make for an above average thriller. Eastwood is believable in the role and the story doesn't get too far out to be enjoyed.<br /><br />There is some back story about both the agent and the assassin contained herein which make things more interesting. This ranks up there with one of his best.

0486437507|5.0|Robert W. Chambers is an almost forgotten writer of fantasy and horror who should be honored for his originality and insights into human nature. To read the King In Yellow is to give Robert W. Chambers a chance to show how a well written psychological story can unfold. His stories build slowly and soon pull the reader into a world only Chambers could envision. To reveal any of his story plots here would do him an injustice.   The sad part of today's readership is that many no longer have the patience to move slowly and deeply through a story to it's climax. Everything must be swift and obvious these days. If you read Robert W. Chambers prepare for a time in another world that slowly sucks you into the unknown and often the terrifying. Grab an armchair, turn off the tv and the radio and quietly allow yourself to be absorbed by Chambers masterful writing. You will be delighted.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It is unbelievable beautiful! The videography, photography, the subjects, but above all the human effort that was invested in bringing us these glorious views and animal/nature actions. We are enjoying it tremendously.
B001E75QGG|3.0|I could not get uncompressed digital audio (Dolby TrueHD) in english.  It would only work in 5.1 Dolby Digital on the foreign languages and I had to watch the movie in 2 speaker stereo.  This greatly reduced the overall watching experience and I would not recommend it for this reason.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|The movie itself doesn't have much substance, but has some cute one-liners, and is fun to watch in 3D.  After fumbling with the glasses and getting them situated in the right place, I actually enjoyed the movie.  Lots of neat special 3D effects, but I must admit, dealing with the glasses was a hassle.  They did make the movie appear darker, and there were double lines and images at times.  No doubt, DVD 3D processing needs much improvement, but for now, this seems to be the only thing we have.  Hopefully, they will keep working on the technology and bring back 3D movies with better viewing options.  If you can, get the 3D version, and watch the movie for what it is - just a fun experience.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This was our first of many BluRay movies to purchase. Right away we were impressed. The menu alone is beautiful. Once the movie was running, we could see the difference between regular DVD and BluRay. The detail was stunning. You can see grains of sand in the desert scenes. The BD-Live features also work well. Bottom line, we would recommend this BluRay.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|this is what blu-ray was meant for.journey is based on the jules verne book of the same name.360% diferent then the 1958 movie with james mason and pat boone.     without getting into the story,which won't burn deep in anyone memory  bank it does do what it was meant to do, intertain!this blu-ray comes with a slip 3d case,2d and 3d versions and a bonus digital copy.    the 3d is first rate,most likely better then the sd dvd.  from the opening new line cinema[which come right at you]to a t-rex that wants to eat you!flying fish with huge teeth,sparks from the lava that come at you and around you,its 3d at its best.the 3d process,well there is a trade off,colors are not as defined as a 2d movie and some ghosting acures,but all in all its great fun,the surround sound is active in all speakers,but no dolby digital true hd.but a dolby digital 5.1 which is at a higher bit rate then  on a sd dvd.  to sum it up this movie is a hoot and if you never have seen a 3d film this is the one!  one more thing, with blu-ray players prices dropping like a lead baloon[500.00 to a 1000.00 last year],this year a couple hundred and big friday around the corner,it makes sense to jump to blu-ray...enjoy
B001GQACGO|4.0|I personally enjoyed this CD, at first I was a little upset at how the standard version is like the warm up to the deluxe version...everything should've just been on one CD but that's my only problem with it. I think she decided to branch out and do some different things which I like, when you give the same stuff over and over again you get stuck and can't get out. Everyone who knows anything about DC3 and Beyonce knows that she's had this alter Ego Sasha for years so the whole concept of the album was very interesting. The Beyonce side of the CD has a lot of ballads which most people said they missed from the B-day album. I think that alot of the ballads are strong. Halo and If I were a boy are the standout ballads but I'm also feeling Broken Hearted girl and Smash into you. On the Sasha side of the CD Singles ladies is a must and then my favs are Ego, Video phone, and Diva which was produced by the same guy that did Lil Waynes A milli. Overall I think the CD is great she tapped into her artistic side and did some new things. Everyone who are really fans will appreciate this and enjoy the CD...it's only those haters without an open mind that will dog the album out. It's worth the 14.00 go grab it.
B000W4HIX6|4.0|I bought this Blu-ray when it went on sale. Best blind buy ever. I had never seen the movie before, so I took a long shot and ordered it anyways. Great action, great storyline, great picture quality, and great audio quality. I was so happy with my purchase, that now I want all the Die Hard's.    So go ahead take a chance, Die Hard on Blu-ray is a must see.
1572704497|5.0|Whenever I'm going to be doing something labor intensive, but not very exciting, I enjoy listening to an audio book.  Some people like to point out every instance of failure as a novelist they can think of regarding Agatha Christie.  I, on the other hand, choose to overlook any defects in her stories and just enjoy them.  When you add the narration by Hugh Fraser it makes the experience all that much more satisfying.  I did not find any defects or glitches in this recording and Fraser has a warmth and intimacy to his voice which makes it seem that he is right there in the room with you, almost telling you the story personally.<br /><br />Ten people were invited to Indian Island, Sticklehaven, Devon.  Ten people who didn't recognize the name of their host (or in some cases, their employer) but who went nevertheless for their own personal reasons.  Everything seemed to be going well until the recording was played which accused each of them of the crime of murder.  In each bedroom was a large framed piece of parchment, a poem which most of them recognized from their childhood.  When the deaths began to happen, they realized that the poem was put there as a warning of what was about to happen.  And they were trapped on the island.<br /><br />Even if you have read this story by Agatha Christie you will still enjoy the narration by Hugh Fraser.  He is so permanently linked in my memory with the Hercule Poirot stories presented on PBS that I feel as if I am visiting with two old friends, Fraser and Christie.  Highly recommended by a Christie fan and a fan of audio recordings.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great work out. Love that the intervals are timed and you're not counting reps, that gets annoying. Jillian is motivational and only annoying because you see her say the same things over and over. Anyone would get annoying.

B0000041Z6|4.0|This recording ofers fine sound quality and the Fifth is perhaps the best performace. Chicago as always features a great brass section.

B001E75QGG|4.0|The filming was true to the originals. The blu ray version has a great picture and sound.     Although it should have been made 10 years ago while H. Ford was a bit younger, then Connery could have been in it
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is an exceptional series and it's put together very well.    Yes, there are several places where the image quality is poor or has some kind of \\"noise\\" but they mention on the cover that not all of the video was shot in HD.  Just that some of what appears to be HD shots have some weird noise on it and it's definitely on the disc.    But this does not detract from my opinion of the disc as it's content is excellent and the image and sound are also excellent, overall.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|-Highest quality video and sound  -Action is awesome  -Acting is superb    This movie is straight up the best blu ray so far. Dark Knight should be a grand slam if they do it up good for blu ray.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I had heard some of Alison's music on the radio but hadn't sought out her specifically. One night I watched her and the band perform on our local PBS station.  The next day I ordered this CD and was delighted to find it was the same performance I had seen the night before. A new favorite.
B000002UVZ|4.0|In what was a transitional album for R.E.M., Michael Stipe's vocals are pushed to the fore of the band's mix, and suddenly, their jangle-rock puts the emphasis on Rock. The greatest evidence of that is on songs one and three. \\"Begin The Begin\\" pairs Bill Berry's drum slam to Peter Buck's ringing guitars and delivered on of the band's most propulsive tracks to that moment. Then comes the first of Michael Stipe's more overt socially conscious songs, the environmentally themed \\"Fall On Me.\\" While the intent is masked by the usual lyrical obtuseness, you can hear just about every word Stipe is singing. When you added Bill Berry (whom I have long considered the band's secret weapon) singing a counter lyric throughout the song, it shows that R.E.M. were making \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\" an effort to polish their sound.<br /><br />Mich of that can be credited to producer Don Gehman, who was partly responsible for putting the stonesy wallop inside of [[ASIN:B00062ID4W John Mellencamp]]. If [[ASIN:B000002UW0 Fables of the Reconstruction]] was often dark and dense, \\"Pageant\\" was the light at the opposite end of the tunnel. There's more joyfulness here than on that previous album, down to the band playing pranks by listing the songs out of order and hiding the cover of \\"Superman\\" - sung with a goofy cheer by Berry - entirely from the track listing. There's even a oddball of a track, \\"Underneath The Bunker.\\" R.E.M., often accused of being overtly serious, just wanted to have fun.<br /><br />\\"Trust in your calling,<br />make sure your calling's true.<br />Think of others,<br />the others think of you.<br />Silly rule golden words make practice,<br />practice makes perfect,<br />perfect is a fault,<br />and faultlines change.\\"<br /><br />So sang Michael Stipe on this album's \\"I Believe.\\" The band was one album away from their commercial breakthrough, [[ASIN:B000002UW1 Document]], and \\"Pageant\\" was the real harbinger of their future.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I would give this album 4 1/2 stars if I could. I sort of stumbled upon David Cook through a deal made with my fiance. I would watch American Idol, if she watched UFC with me. Needless to say, I got hooked on Cook, from the very moment I heard \\"Hello\\". I was thrilled that I could actually root for a rocker on the show. I managed to get my hands on some of his music with Axium, and even picked up Analog Heart...which needs to be released so everybody can hear it.     The reason that I give 4 1/2 stars is because of Analog Heart, his first cd. It is an unreal album. The self titled cd is excellent as well, especially \\"Bar-Ba-Sal\\" and \\"Permanent\\". It took me a few listens to really catch ahold of what the album was all about. \\"Bar-Ba-Sal\\" sticks out because it just rocks, it may noy be a Top 40 hit, but maybe that is why I dig it so much. Great guitar work. \\"Permanent\\" is his gutsiest song on the album, obviously dedicated to his brother. He puts his whole heart and soul into it. \\"Heroes\\" is another well written song. \\"Lie\\" and \\"Avalanche\\" stand out to me as well. The album however falls short in comparison to Analog Heart, mainly because I feel that the songs are too mainstream ready. What I liked about Axium and Analog Heart was the fact that he was still struggling to make it in the industry, and you can definetely feel it in his lyrics and music. That aside, this album does fill the need for new material from David, and regardless I will continue to listen to it.     Alot of people bash this album saying that Cook is still living in the 1990's with his grunge roots. I say let him, everything comes back full circle. Cook made me want to listen to my old STP, Our Lady Peace and Candlebox albums again. David is a true representative of the Midwest rock scene, and I am glad he brought on MWK's guitarist to play in his band.    That being said, I recommend this disc to everybody, whether you listen to Top 40 radio(ehhh), or want to bring back the feeling of the 1990's again...and if you can get your hands on a copy of Analog Heart, DO IT!!!

B00169N0BK|1.0|I am new to color management - but not to software engineering and release having done support, engineering, test and release since 1982 in the retail and enterprise space.<br /><br />I think I am one of the CM's target market segments being a part time wedding and portrait photographer. I am using an Epson Stylus pro 3800.<br /><br />Downloading and installing version 1.05 at 364 MB and using it as my base install on a Vista home premium, x64 SP1 system here are my observations:<br />Tehe install requires .net and java - making it quite long to install and cluttering up your machine - this was on a new dual core 3 Ghz system, it took about 42 minutes to install.<br /><br />1. monitor profiles do not stick, they disappear after UAC or on resume from S3 standby. This has been a known issue since at least mid 2007, based on threads across multiple boards and product lines.<br />X-rites supports comments - \\" it's a Vista issue - not our problem\\". -<br /><br />That's poor response - they could have a work around for it, instead of making me figure out what do do on my own by searching the internet.<br />I've temporarily solved it by placing the CM gamma icon on my desktop and after resume rerunning it.<br /><br />2. Per CM support the patch reading process is iterative and there are rounding errors on each successive pass of reading.<br />X-rite has no hard and fast rule - surprise ! But I have been told that no more that four or five at most optimizations can be read without inducing errors. and there is no way to determine when a color profile has become unusable.<br /><br />I have a profile that has gone far green blue - at eight optimizations using Epson Ultra Premium Photo Luster I sent it into technical support to get a comparison to a known \\"good\\" profile and got told to go purchase their professional services.<br />On the Luminous Landscape, other users reported that they also were told  to purchase X-rite's other solutions as the technical fix.<br /><br />3. I am used to a customer is right attitude,  or maybe a don't care attitude, but typically support being helpful, off the bat and from the beginning I have to say they have referred me to third party vendors and third party online forums, told me to go buy their three thousand dollar solution, and then go puchase training and support from then, all for profiling Crane Museo Rag and the above Epson pper - what a crock ! they have been quite antagonistic maybe they have knowledge - but interaction of some tech support stinks to put it mildly.<br /><br />I will say when I changed technicians - I got a different one who was more civil and answered some of the questions rather than giving me a run around.<br /><br />4. the profiles generated are not visible in the Epson control panel version 6.50 under vista x64 the answer I got after switching technicians after 5 email rounds was that Epson does not read version 4 of the ICC profiles - although Photoshop, Lightroom 2.1, Qimage all seem to just fine, and Epson support states that they read icc version 4 profiles just fine.<br /><br />5. The Colormunki made profiles do seem to get rid of some of the color casts from the stock factory profiles, however the shadow detail seems to be somewhat compressed, this may have something to do with the way in which they read and sample colors - but I really do not know.<br /><br />Overall I would not recommend this product to anyone who was not aware of the technical hurdles and problems in this segment of the industry, compared to support from Canon, Epson, DDI, or about any other vendor I've seen this was quite poor.<br /><br />The amazing thing has been the utter and total arrogance exhibited that bordered on plain hostility, well now I'm hostile.. and I'm usually able to put up with a lot from flaky drivers and know nothing tech support.<br />The problem here is they do know something about color and I do respect that, - but literally X-rite thinks that there is not a single solitaryproblem with their product and that you should be grateful to have it.<br /><br />I fist called them as I became concerned while waiting for the ColorMunki as some threads had commented on the vagueness of the instructions - asking what the exact steps were to turn off color managment for my printer.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|oops...Genesis always gives me verbal diarrhea...  this is a continuation...    To stop from repeating the same thing over and over...    Mike's bass and Phil's drums thru the five albums are a revelation.  LAMB's recurring riff of BUH-BUH, BUH-UH, BUH is hypnotic...my lord check out the beginning of Back in NYC!  Like a crazy heartbeat...then the new backing vocals of NO TIME! NO TIME! NOO!!!    Hogweed, Salmacis, Watcher, Can-Utility , The Knife, Apocalypse 9/8, Musical Box, Fly on the Windshield are all BLISTERING and perfect...Phil is just beating the crap out of his kit...the toms sound great osscillating between my ears.  I have heard alot about compression problems from other reviewers...don't listen to these audiophile snobs...they just like the look/sound of their own jargon.  These new mixes are FANTASTIC.  Just put on your headphones and prepare for the angelic caress and hellspawn pummeling that is Genesis.     Now...the DVDs  I hope they are holding back the best stuff for the live box.  The footage is good, but not great.  I wish there were more performances of deeper album cuts, not just the usual Musical Box and Supper's Ready.  Plus, the albums that precede a live one (FOXTROT, W&W, and ABACAB) all have less than stellar footage...again, I can only hope that GENESIS LIVE, SECONDS OUT, and THREE SIDES LIVE are going to be HUGE.    First, I thought the box would be worth it just for the live footage, but having gone thru it all, it has reversed...just for the new mixes alone, this set is worth the money if you anykind of fan at all.  The video stuff is a bonus.  Oh, and the Genesis Plays Jackson is fascinating...to hear Anyway with new lyrics about making a Frankensteinish sex slave is hilarious, added to the fact that these geniuses were only 20!!!!!!    BUY IT!!!!!!
B000UAE7RW|5.0|What a great movie - and such good acting. Jack Nicolson and Faye Dunaway are superb in this movie.
B000000W5P|5.0|\\"Some Girls\\" created controversy upon its release as black leaders objected to the title song lyrics.  Controversy must sell as the album sales outdid everything else they've done.  It's the \\"New York\\" album, as Jagger's dancing days at Studio 54 seemed to be chronicled here.  \\"Respectable\\" mocks his wife with Mick's anger towards women, a love-hate thing Mick has with women, and a frequent motiff in his lyrics.  \\"Some Girls\\" reflects Jagger's social life as he kisses and tells all.  The band explodes on \\"Shattered\\" as Mick has his 20th nervous breakdown.  \\"Beast of Burden\\" reeks of Keith's problems with Anita.  Mick's country music joke, \\"Far Away Eyes\\" adds humor and a fine steel guitar to the album.  \\"Lies\\" is probably the weakest song on the album, an angry rocker.  \\"Before they make me run\\" is an ode to Keith's narcotic inspired legal trouble.  \\"Just My Imagination\\" is old Stones', an English rock band covering the R&B classics, something they do on every album, for old time's sake?  This is one of their best covers, as Mick brings new life to the tune.  Mick gets very shiek, kinky, and cuts a dashing path with \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\", one of the best rockers the Stones ever did.  The big disco hit \\"Miss You\\", four on the floor rhythm, with hypnotic harmonica and breathless passion, was a big hit on the radio. \\"Some Girls\\" is the Stones at their peak, right before their incredible 81 tour (saw them at Anaheim).  It's a peak the Stones revisit with \\"Shine a Light\\", their latest movie, which revisits many of the songs from this album.  Is it better than \\"Sticky Fingers\\"; \\"Exile on Main Street\\" or \\"Let it Bleed\\"?  I can't say as it's a dilemma for me, I love all of these albums.  God knows I love the Stones.  Been listening to them since they were \\"England's newest hitmakers\\", came to San Bernardino (my parents wouldn't let me go at age 12), and dominated the radio with \\"Satisfaction\\".  Saw them in 69 (San Diego); 73 (Hawaii); 81 (Anaheim); and Las Vegas (07), and I hope to see them again.and I hope to see them again.

1433502429|5.0|ESV is an excellent translation of the Scriptures. The English Standard Version was created to help people understand the Bible in a deeper way. It enables you to encounter the timeless truth of God's Word as a powerful, compelling, life-changing reality. The ESV is a literal translation, suited to Bible study.    On each page are the actual words of the Bible in a larger font for easy reading. On the lower part of the same page are the study notes in smaller, but easily read font. The flow is natural and easy on the eyes.    The doctrinal perspective of the ESV is that of classic evangelical orthodoxy. While I enjoy both the King James Version and the New Living Translation, I find the ESV to be similar to both. It is accurate, enjoyable, and study worthy.    I would recommend the ESV to everyone who wants to study God's Word and yet do so with the same enjoyment level as when you are reading for pleasure and prayer time. This version has really blessed me.

B000089CJI|5.0|The only way to describe this album is \\"indescribable\\".       Of the entire collection, one song will forever stick in my mind. \\"Such Great Heights\\" was introduced to me by my ex, along with several other songs from the album. Though they were difficult to hear over the rumble of the car's ragged engine, I got a sense of the album's pop-electric-indie ambiance which still haunts me.  \\"When you are out there on the road...\\"    The chorus makes me think of flying high above the earth with the one you love, above the troubles where \\"everything looks perfect from far away.\\" The middle \\"break-down\\" is perfectly spaced and wonderfully blended. This song encompasses all moods, from wistful, to happy, to hurting, to love.        This song blends wonderfully into the next song \\"Sleeping In\\", which I also fell in love with. Each song is distinct and unique, wonderfully creative. Obviously extremely creative, this pair of talented musicians known as Postal Service (with wonderful, subtle backing vocals by Jenny Lewis and Jenny Wood's duet in \\"Nothing Better\\") has collaborated to create a magnificent work.        The beauty of The Postal Service lies in their ability to incorporate non-musical electronic sounds, found them on a driving beat, and blend in soaring, heart-melting vocals that glide over honest, simple, yet profound lyrics and create a unique musical experience. Complex layers of sound intensify the need to cry and dance at the same time.    With Ben Gibbard's lyrics and voice alone, this album would be worthwhile. But the electronic elements and wonderful mixes of sounds make this album truly distinctive and exquisite. I had considered just buying \\"Such Great Heights\\" on Itunes, but after reading all the great reviews, purchased the whole album. I'm so glad I did, because I love every song on the album, and have had it on repeat on my ipod for weeks.     Ben Gibbard has an outstanding concept in creating a cd that defies so many \\"rules\\" of song, traditional music,and use of sound. His creativity and openness shine through in this charming album. You can't help but sigh as he melodically sings:    \\"I want to take you far   From the cynics in this town   And kiss you on the mouth...\\"

B000002KHF|5.0|Van Morrison's 1970 album \\"Moondance\\" has always been acclaimed as one of the best albums in the history of rock music. Whilst of itself that distinction means little to me, in the case of \\"Moondance\\" there can hardly be a more fitting description for what stands as the most remarkable example of the blending of dense, funky rhythms to pastoral folk music settings.<br /><br />All through \\"Moondance\\", Van Morrison's deep mystical sense, inherited from living in the rich, fertile \\"Emerald Isle\\", stands strong in a manner that grips a listener forever after a single serious listen. The upfront vocal of the simple, dreamy opener \\"And It Stoned Me\\" might be soft in tone, but it sure packs both a punch and the ability to create the most evocative sort of imagery you will find in music history. The title track is one of the greatest moments in the history of music: the soulful rhythm and Morrison's warm, soulful voice combine with a now-fabled theme of the coming of autumn in the British Isles and the backing of powerfully blown flute and saxophone to create a song that is emotionally explosive in its intensity even if it never announces the slightest desire to be. The way in which Van Morrison sings - making the lyrics sound less poetic than they are - only adds to the mystery of an amazing piece of music.<br /><br />\\"Crazy Love\\" and \\"Into the Mystic\\" have a simple, truly transcendent beauty in which Van's voice can at times seem totally rigid, yet manages to convey the sweetest emotion better than a huge number of bad imitations (some of which, like Joe Cocker, were already active when \\"Moondance\\" came out). \\"Caravan\\" may lack the intense drumming, but still the wordless chorus is a perfect complement to the verses of praise to radio - out of place, maybe, in 2008, but still impressive historically.<br /><br />\\"Come Running\\" returns to the simple, funky beat of the title tune to almost equal effect, whilst the harpsichord and flute turn the underrated penultimate track \\"Everyone\\" into an amazing singalong anthem. The gospel-based \\"Brand New Day\\" is the most mysterious song here: a tale of redemption that nobody has repeated.<br /><br />With is earthy, mystical lyrics, simple arrangements, and fiery, passionate vocals, \\"Moondance\\" created a fusion of folk-rock and soulful vocals that many have been influenced by but none have come near replicating. There is a reason why so many critics rate this as one of the best recordings ever made, and you too will understand for sure if you listen.g singalong anthem.

B000005H7D|5.0|Art is challenging because there are purposely only a few \\"rules of the road\\" and often no trail of clues left for the uninitiated to find his way around or especially to find his way into the artist's head, which is often where he needs to be in order to understand anything -- not to mention, in order to understand what was intended. Lucky for the uninitiated, there is almost always an ascending ladder of understanding with multiple open doors at each rung of the ladder for appreciation and enjoyment -- even when understanding is elusive (or even completely closed off).  As well, there are invariably multiple routes to meanings, feelings and even to the transcendental itself. That is to say it is entirely possible to make the artistic journey and many of the necessary connections without any artistic understanding whatsoever. The mind is a powerful instrument, that often can cut through intellectual complexity and just levitate to other worlds of meaning without any independent effort, and without \\"passing Go.\\" However, to do so without full understanding makes life much less interesting, certainly less rich, and always much less fulfilling. The quest for understanding is life itself.<br /><br />Some artists like Theolonius Monk, send out complex signals through their music and could care less whether the message is received or not.  Others like Lionel Hampton is concerned about nothing else. Omar Khayyam's poems for instance all seem to have a simple motif about how fleeting life is and about how enjoyment for the moment is the only reality, so drink up. But then he springs on us the idea that \\"God plays tricks:\\" for the ultimate truth is that the only reality is death itself: In a hundred ways he tells us (with tricks of verse) that real men face death straight up. Period. Painters are notorious for feeling cramped by modes of expressions such as by a canvas, by different paints, by the dimensionality of space, time and distance, by colors, texture, and form and,by structure even more generally. Most times the artist is unwittingly playing games with himself as Bach does with his Fugues: the message is often in the pattern, in the riff, in the mood, even in the smell in the air.<br /><br />Why they do this is not always clear? But a good guess is that they are often trying to stretch their art form, trying (sometimes desperately as is the case with Coltrane here) to remove conventional strictures, trying to get outside of themselves and outside of their instruments, struggling to make new connecting across previously forbidden barriers and into new modalities: that is, trying to move across and beyond conventional dimensions, grasping to reach the transcendental state, trying to transform old modalities into new ones, and for any of a thousand other reasons. The ultimate goal however is that all roads lead to that elusive inner self, the soul.<br /><br />In music this quest to reach the transcendental state through cross-modality can reach insane proportions, as is the case with Theolonious Monk, whose exquisite rhythms and angular chords border on the edge of both insanity and cacophony. Monk didn't care about either. He always \\"knows\\" where he is headed, even if no one else does! Period. Some musicians like Miles Davis, in an indirect route to the soul, want to use their horns to paint pictures with notes. Some Painters like Wassily Kandinsky, do the reverse in seeking to make the canvas speak to the ear through form. Well, of course there are limits to what can be done cross-modally, but equally, there is also a place where the search is endless, and it is in the quest for trying to touch the soul: reaching for the transcendental is the same as reaching for the infinite.<br /><br />John Coltrane in this incredible album (under a pseudo name and for another recording company) is a study in how to use \\"sound\\" to reach for the soul, the transcendental, the infinite. This album, Blue Trane, is lesson #1 enroute to linking the Blues form to the transcendental, that is to say to the soul. It presages what was to come in Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme.\\" It is a clear, unadorned lesson in higher musical understanding. There is earthiness, incandescent fire, saxophone wailing and honking, intricate beauty, violent torment, soulful vamps and riffs, a virtual musical potpourri of expressive forms. As always, Trane leaves everything on the table. No one who is trying to understand him will be left unsatisfied no matter what rung of the ladder you may be. But even for those who do not even try to understand him, there is meaning here. Its like the Sisters in the Baptist Church who \\"get Happy\\" and resolve all their fights with their demons in a transcendental paroxysm of  \\"jumping and shouting,\\" and then they faint, and there is peace between them and their God.We all bask in their glow. We know instinctively that something important has just happened. The same is true here. Understanding is helpful but not necessary.<br /><br />Here Trane too attempts to get inside the \\"bone marrow\\" of the blues and then he tries to turn it inside out and wring every ounce of meaning out of it. He jumps up and down as if he is beating a rug. When he finishes there is peace, incandescent light, a quiet flow that connects the Blues to the larger universe. The challenge has been met; it is over, it has been overcome. There is peace all over the musical world and the Blues will never be the same again. This is the best album in all of Jazz. Period. 1000 stars.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather Series (I-III) is without doubt the greatest trilogy to be placed on film. Add a bonus disc that includes interviews, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes and much more and you have a collectors edition. Put it on Blu-Ray and you have a fantastic experience. On a winters weekend in Michigan, my wife and I watched the entire set and it was like watching for the films for first time. Many scenes were filmed in dark settings (to set mood), however VHS, Laserdisc and even standard DVD did not do justice to the experience. The Blu-Ray version however blew me away. No need to review the movies unless you have just crawled out from under a rock, however if you want to know if the investment is worth the price?  It is for us...
0670020745|5.0|After hearing about this book from someone, I really felt to get it.  It did not disappoint.  This woman had an incredible journey that changed her life forever.  I could identify with so many different aspects of her process, I really enjoyed it.  I was amazed how much I could identify with her about, even though recently I had just had a fractured arm, nothing like her experience, but, many things changed anyway.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
