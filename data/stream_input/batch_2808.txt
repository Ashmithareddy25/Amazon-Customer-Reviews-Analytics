B00BU18U82|5.0|Just purchased today, my son LOVES it. I loved the price! Go Amazon!<br />  Keep farm style games coming, we will buy them all!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book. Forget that it's a sci-fi book. Yes it's set in space and the future, but the setting is just a vehicle for the story. Coming of age and loosing a child's naïveté.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Any time I see a new book from either Douglas Preston or the combination of Childs & Preston I know it's going to be a winner
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is great for kids or for the kid in all of us . I enjoyed the music and all the fun characters . If you love fish like me you will go bananas for this app . I know you'll love it so give this app a try!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This Sci-Fi/Fantasy Adventure novel Outview is about time travel, reincarnation, and discovering the inner powers we all have if we could just connect with them.<br />Nate is on the adventure of a life time trying to save and prove his brother isn't crazy. Trying to prove he isn't either. The journey takes him to so many different places and thru many life times. Each story was a story itself that I felt thoroughly involved in.<br /><br />First lesson you will learn is everything can change in an instant and in this fast paced, page turner is does!<br />The writer literally makes you feel as it you are a part of the story and every new adventure was very creative from the highest mountain peaks, and rain forest to riding a mountain lion and even in war with his dead father.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book and will have to read the second one for more great adventures. There was so much going and the time just flew by as I entered into every world with the author.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and wish I could give more than five stars.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I would rather see the play.  Book was slow, too wordy.  A sleeper, not for everyone. I may pick up at another time

B00992CF6W|5.0|This the best game in the world and I might ever get the pc version.  Some people think it's boring but I think it's the best game because of the mobs and trying to find wool for beds and finding diamonds is just exciting.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I deleted this app because after every calculation it would freeze. I would have to force close the program and restart. I would not recommend this app.

B000FC10MU|1.0|There was only one well-written line in the whole book -- though in fairness the delight that line provoked was greatly enhanced by the 400 odd pages of drudgery that preceded it.  But I read the whole thing.<br /><br />I couldn't tell you why, though.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|...I love playing this game. It is great fun.  I could play I t all the time.  Uno is  very fun to play.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I downloaded this app to a Kindle Fire HD.  When the alarm went off I had to go through the screen saver and password to turn off the alarm.  My wife was pretty unhappy!  At least it woke me up with no need for a snooze alarm.

0385335997|5.0|This third installment of this fabulous epic \\"OUTLANDER\\" adventure has always been my favorite of the series.  All the books hold so much adventure and detailed historical information...but THIS installment is absolutely, mind boggling thrilling.  At least it is for me.<br /><br />To quickly recap:  In the first book, Claire Randall had disappeared from 1945, to the eighteenth century Scotland; the year of 1743.  She vanished when she went through the standing stones of Craigh na Dun and her adventure began.  She fell in love with and married Jamie Fraser, and lived with him for nearly three years, before being forced to return through the standing stones to 1948, Scotland, which is the end of the second book, Dragonfly in Amber.<br /><br />It's now twenty years later, 1968.  Claire, Brianna (Jamies' daughter) and Roger Wakefield MacKenzie (a Historian) are reconstructing and following Jamie's life after Culloden, trying to locate where he might be buried.  After thinking Jamie has been dead all these twenty years, Claire discovers Jamie survived Culloden.  Roger eventually locates Jamie in History.  Jamie is alive!  After a tearful goodbye to her daughter, Claire goes back in time......again.  She knows she'll never return to the Twentieth Century, or see her daughter again.<br /><br />Claire locates Jamie and finds a man different from the man she knew before.  Their reunion is shocking, tearful and full of questions and readjustments.  Seeing all the changes in Jamie, Claire begins to doubt her decision to come back the to the eighteenth century.  But Jamie won't let her go.<br /><br />This third book of the OUTLANDER saga could actually stand on its own....but WHY would you not want to read this fabulous epic from it's beginning?!? IMHO, it's best to start at the beginning with [[ASIN:0440212561 Outlander]] if for nothing else than to fully appreciate and understand the devoted relationship between Jamie and Claire....and to thoroughly KNOW them.  Then proceed to [[ASIN:0385335970 Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, Book 2)]] to understand how their devotion for each other grows.<br /><br /> Ms. Gabaldon ALWAYS discloses and informs the reader of facts, events and experiences of Jamie and Claire, then walks away from those events and experiences.  And then, somewhere in later episodes, she brings that moment back ....somewhere in the series. And VOYAGER follows this line of dropping information upon the reader, only to make it reappear later in the book. It's like little informative puzzle pieces that she plops down and walks away from, closing the chapter.  And leaves the reader thinking, \\"wow!\\"  ....and then somewhere later in the same book, (or subsequent books), that information or event is brought back to our mind/attention.  And the reader is soundly blown away!<br /><br />As I've previously stated (in the first two reviews), this is the third time I've read this Epic 7 book Outlander Saga through the many years but it's the first time I've taken time to give a review. Like all the other 5★ rave reviews, I can never put this story down once I begin...errands are curtailed, housework goes to pot and laundry piles up. It holds me completely captive with crippling intensity with all of its emotional structure and profound dimension. The story is so captivating and consuming that I find that I begin to slow my reading down as I see the end looming in sight, hating to let Jamie and Claire go. It never fails. BECAUSE THESE CHARACTERS ARE REAL.. DANG IT!  Reading VOYAGER for the third time, I noticed chapter 61 gives us a definite clue where Jamie and Claire will end up in the end (of the Saga).  It's gonna be hard to wait to find out.<br /><br />When I read this story, I'm IN Scotland, or France, or the Colonies of America! I mean...I'M THERE! I see the deplorable living conditions...smell the stink of the slops thrown out the windows.  I'm walking the cobblestones and seeing the people...seeing all the immigrants in their different cultural garb. The descriptive detail and narration are so strong, exact and perfect that one cannot help be emotionally invested in little time. You're transported into another world and time...and you're reluctant to return. Diana Gabaldon is...simply put... brilliant! The absolute best!  Yes, the stories are long but each character is carefully considered...and the events that are chosen to be included are necessary to have the story told well.<br /><br />If you will allow the time, and give the effort to patiently absorb the detailed narration, you will be blessed with the most emotional Saga ever to hold in your hands.erent cultural garb.

B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This book was magnificent. It is better than any book I have ever read. The extraordinary tales of Alex and Connor breath-taking, and excitement fills the air. I recommend this book to any fairy-tale lover or book worm,  and is perfectly suitable for anyone who needs a good book. I highly recommend it, and if you choose Harry potter over this,  you will regret it when you start reading the 5th book. Believe me, Don't waste your time reading Harry Potter for 5 months.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|You must watch this movie. I am sure you and your family will love it. Consider \\"North Face,\\" the bone-chilling, superbly mounted record of an assault on the north face of the Eiger, which is known by the grim understatement as \\"the last remaining problem in the Alps.\\"
B005SCSL56|5.0|I love this book. There is nothing like it. Iran, who wouldn't want to learn about the history of the evil queen and why she really hated Snow white? The main characters are in such a exciting adventure, who wouldn't want to join them? There is no excuse to not read read this book.  Furthermore, I rate this five star.
0525478817|5.0|I love this book like i haven't started reading it but i will tomorrow. Shipping was so fast came in 1 week after purchase. 1 thing i love about this is that its hardcover and was free shipping and really good price. Over at barnes and nobles i wouldn't want to pay 20+ dollars just to get it , so i got it online and it was way cheaper. I would recommend this book to teens.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|I got this in recently, and I'm waiting for season two. I love this anime to death (pun intended)!<br /><br />Let me tell you what's good about it: The plot, the panties, the naked, bouncing, massive boobs, the characters (even the guys), the relationships between the characters (not just the fact that the girls like the main guy best, but the friendships as well). Everythign is good about this.<br /><br />Oh, and on DVD, the nurse's Eiken-sized tits are totally uncensored when she's naked. SQUEE!

0786956291|4.0|The map and player's handbook that are included are great. The DM guide, not so much. You need to find the other books if all possible and read them also. This starter kit is made for people that have some experience.

B008C20TDG|5.0|The Whole 30 is the working for me, and it is really the first eating plan that has made a difference for me in decades.  I read the book in an afternoon, on my kindle.  It all resonated with me rather quickly, and I began the plan the next day.  Since I started feeling better and seeing results within days, I am totally sold on this plan.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|a well- written, beautifully constructed novel; McCann weaves a story which is hard to put down.  I definitely recommend it.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I forgot how much I missed reading a Neil Gaiman story until I picked this one up. It's a well told story told from a childs point of view, for the most part. It's a little short and I was sad to have finished reading it, but thats a good thing, right? :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|the dead don't talk, but they walk and eat, the drama is cool. it keep me at the edge of my seat. I can't wait for the next season to air, to see how the living will survive the dead. their issue, situation,  and how they solve the problem. when it come to their attention.
B001BIMYXQ|3.0|I am a huge Annie Lennox/Eurythmics fan from WAY BACK.  However, I bought this to have all the old favorites in my digital collection, yet, when I compared it to the old songs I already had (from one of the old CDs), I was surprised that 1) the sound quality was not as good, it had too much base and still sounded a little tinny.  Further, when comparing the songs from the old CD, I noticed this version had shorter edits.  I'm rather disappointed and find this version almost un-listenable because I SO loved the original songs...  I guess, I may have to buy each song now from the original recordings if I can find them.  Before you purchase this one, you might investigate these things yourself.
B000007WK4|5.0|Unknown to me these past 40 years this extremely talented and creative man sold over 40m albums in Europe. He never crossed the pond. I feel so fortunate to have found him by accident and have bought 2 Dvd's and his blues box set as well as this and a few other Cd's.  He writes all his own music. His skills on a bottle neck guitar are breath taking  I am flying to London in October to see him in October.  Twilight of his career but better late than never. Recommended for those that like rock, jazz and blues. I have no idea why he never really crossed the pond.  Outstanding talent
B005HSG3U6|3.0|This case protects my Kindle Fire, the stand feature is not real secure when holding it in your hands, or sitting it on your lap. It's very light weight, my previous case was much heavier.
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious. Nick Cage was well cast and sardonic.  Miss Fit was my favorite character. I watched this with my 19 year old daughter and we are already planning to see the sequel.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Like many others I am having the same problem with installing the game and immediately getting the message that I needed to update it doesn't have any update but won't let me actually play the game. Any plans to fix this so I can try it out???<br />Finally was able to play the game.  It is a fun game and I'm still trying to figure a few things out.  I hope that as I level up, I'll be able to get more energy since it seems to get used up quickly.  Especially when you need to use 7 just to chop down a tree!!

059306495X|3.0|I Am Pilgrim is without a doubt an extraordinary take on the contemporary thriller and running to 700 pages a remarkable interweaving of the lives of two men defined by the experiences of their formative years drawing them into a headlong collision in the defence of their personal affiliations. Opening with a baffling crime scene in New York, the plot expands into a race against time to thwart a devastating terrorist plot by a man known as Saracen, scarred as a boy by the execution of his father in Saudi Arabia who seeks to wreak revenge on the rulers of his native country by attacking its most stalwart of supporters- the United States of America. Pilgrim is the codename of the man dispatched to track and nullify Saracen, himself a man with a convoluted past comprising many identities whose pursuit of Saracen takes him on a terrifying journey across the world to stop this potential act of terrorism which could lead to mass murder...<br /><br />Reflecting the author's background as a screenwriter of many influential action films, the book relies heavily on the visual quality of the locations chosen, and the undying credo of the United States as the harbinger of justice and power in the fight against terrorism, so the ending is never really in doubt but it's a hell of a journey on the way. As the book pivots between the personal stories of Pilgrim and Saracen, so begins a convoluted and at times totally engaging story of cat and mouse, as both men strive to fulfil their roles and we become immersed in to how they have become the men they are. As Saracen's mission becomes clear and we learn more of the background of his pursuer Pilgrim, the depth and scope of Hayes characterisation of both is probably the strongest aspect of this book. As both men embark on differing pilgrimages in their lives, there is a clever blurring of their personal demarcation as being `good' or `bad' as Pilgrim and Saracen exhibit the qualities of both, and my empathies as a reader were waxing and waning between the two. Despite the painting of Saracen as a `baddie', I actually found the unfolding of his personal history the most gripping of the two, but unfortunately towards the middle of the book, there is an imbalance and the weight of the story with the emphasis and drive of the narrative falls more on Pilgrim, with to my mind anyway, an opportunity to maybe have done a little more tightening up in terms of plotting. I actually found myself getting a little bored as events unfolded in Turkey in these middle sections, and wanted to get pulled back to Saracen's skulduggery sooner. Likewise, the careful build-up to the final denouement is largely undone by the sheer incredulity of the ending, which oozed the potential incarnation of the book as Hollywood action film, and all the cliches thereof and to me bore little resemblance of how this should have played out. With this book's evident position as a new take on the somewhat stale espionage thriller genre, I felt Hayes could have been a little braver in light of what had preceded this, and really shaken the reader up instead of relying on a truly stereotypical outcome. In the light of the sheer brilliance of some of the plot threads, the obvious depth of research he has implemented and the strength of the characterisation of both the two main characters and Pilgrim's cohort, NYPD detective Ben Bradley whose personal story and his comeback from the depths of despair is deeply affecting within the main plot, I was disappointed that this fell at the final hurdle.<br /><br />Judging by the enthusiasm for this book by other reviewers, there is no doubt that I Am Pilgrim is a unique, clever and at times enthralling thriller, that is defined by its difference in terms of superlative plotting and characterisation, to other practitioners in this genre. Despite my own observations on some of the weaknesses of this book- much of which could have been resolved by closer editing and a more credible ending- this is definitely worth reading if you enjoy an ambitious and intelligent espionage thriller with plenty of action and a truly international feel.efinitely worth reading if you enjoy an ambitious and intelligent espionage thriller with plenty of action and a truly international feel.

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love this game you can play with real people and that is awesome. I don't like the fact that when we go to play a game and it freezes or sends us back to the main page we lose our coins and tokens we spent to play the game. It wold be nice if  this was fixed it is upsetting to use your last coins and not be able to play a game. Also you can't play with a computer it has to be real people.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|James O'Barr is a master of the morbid, yet poignant love story.  I have loved this story since it was first published in Graphic Novel form and love the role that Brandon Lee plays in the film.  Yet another actor who died before his time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the most captivating stories ever!  It takes you back in time with the beautiful home, characters of every sort and a storyline that keeps you hanging on, waiting for the next show!  I love it!
B004S699HC|5.0|While this movie does not stand up to the quality of the original, it is not TOO bad for a sequel.  I like the premise of the avenging spirit, coming back to &#34;take care of unfinished business&#34;.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|The plot was predictable, but the action sequences were many and mostly well done.  Surprised they eliminated a major character of the franchise.  Bruce Willis' role very underplayed.  Dwayne Johnson is still &#34;The Rock&#34; and acts accordingly.  Fun to watch if you're looking for an action flick.
0345522478|5.0|What a fantastic series. So much fun to read!<br /><br />For me, it's like Dresden Files but more fun/exciting to read, has a more enjoyable fantasy world, and minus all the traits I found to be slightly annoying about Harry Dresden. Honestly, for the first few Iron Druid books I thought, \\"This is like a fun, slightly lesser version of the Dresden Files...\\" then eventually that changed to \\"Screw it, love the books WAY more than the Dresden Files!\\"<br /><br />Ancient Irish/Celtic Mythology. So cool! So much so that I can't believe no one's ever capitalized on this before. We've seen Greek, Roman, Norse, Christian, Vedic, and many others...but this entire pantheon has been completely ignored. I'd never before had a whiff of any of the names he brings up, and I'm simultaneously elated that Hearne enlightened me and furious that I'd gone my entire life ignorant of them.<br /><br />In later books Gods from various pantheons enter the mix, and no matter what the mythology is, Kevin Hearne is (in my opinion) the new reigning champ of finding the perfect balance between paying homage to the familiar mythology we all know and love and yet giving it such an edgy new take on it that it's completely fresh.<br /><br />This series is also surprising clever and insightful in spots, and the casual historical/mythological references he throws of the cuff are fantastic. I don't know where he get's all his info from, but every time I think he must be taking liberties with the personality of a mythology figure or bit of historical background, I look it up and find it is shockingly accurate. He finds these little bits of history that all other authors I've read have ignored, and it really makes it a fresh, interesting world he created instead of using all the same mythology tropes we've seen a thousand times already.<br /><br />It made my super-extremely-uber exclusive list of Top 5 Fantasy Worlds I'd Way Rather Live in Over the Real World.
B0022CY8WK|5.0|I'm a fan of the music of Chicago. Once I saw the movie, I had to buy the soundtrack! It's wonderful and has some great extras! The only negative aspect I would point out is Cell Block Tango. The sound isn't as great as the movie; it seems as if the sound has been dampened. Other than that it was great!<br /><br />P.S. - I do not like Queen Latifah and Lil' Kim's rendition of Cell Block Tango.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|I want to keep watching this show. It is a great modern day telling of a classic character. I can't wait until season 3.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is the first David Baldacci book I read and I am glad I did.  A book has to grab me in the first few pages for me to read it and The Innocent certainly did.  I will definitely be residing more of Baldacci real soon.  I savor books like this and do not want them to end.
B00003CX8N|3.0|The video portion of the movie was great, the audio was poor.  The sound went from an ok level to almost no sound.  Returned it for credit.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Thanks. For nothing. I have spent HOURS AND HOURS on this stupid game, finally reaching level 73/100, then this update today completely wiped out my stupid town.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've been a passionate devotee of LesMiz since my first season viewing on Broadway and have followed this epic in many theaters and several generations of CD and DVD's - hung out at Victor Hugo's Paris digs just breathing in the air (read the WHOLE novel in high school so became addicted early on.)<br />This production was differently portrayed from the stage productions with new talent and perspectives, keeping it alive and fresh for us devoted followers.  The costumes and sets were so authentic it was easy to believe we were dropped into the middle of the Revolution and feeling their passion.<br />Surely not for the very young, and anyone not familiar should read a full synopsis - twice - before delving into the disc.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|A bit repetitive and has an obvious design towards wanting you to pay to unlock additional options, however the overall experience is still an enjoyable one. As a cheap game it is fun beyond its cost. If you opt in to additional options, as a medium priced game it has a fair amount of diversity and replayability.<br />Easy 4 star.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|Terrific movie.  Liked the realistic plot, Pierce Brosnan was super and good supporting cast. Even the scene where J Bond gets a tank in position to blow up the train was a &#34;stretch&#34; it's still a great Bond movie. A must see movie<br /><br />Ron K

B00CEF014E|5.0|SOLSTICE by Damian Stevenson is a well-written psychological thriller with descriptions so vivid they nearly leap off the page.<br /><br />The main character, Dana, is on a road trip with her boyfriend, heading on her way to move in with her sister.  Her boyfriend goes missing, and Dana (a former mental patient) is led to believe that he doesn't even exist and that her fractured mind has contrived the whole situation.  When she moves into the commune where her sister lives, things really begin to get strange, and Dana has to pull herself together to save what's left of her sanity.<br /><br />I enjoyed the author's writing style and the many twists and turns to the plot.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves a thrilling story with a little horror thrown in for good measure.
B00006AW2M|3.0|With this album, the Stones were merely trying to imitate the Beatles ... and were in over their heads ... they could never on their best day beat the Fab Four in an area that they were indeed the best at !<br />Other than the superb \\"2000 Light Years\\", and the very good \\"The Lantern\\", & \\" The Citadel\\" , the rest of the songs sorely miss the mark. Give the Stones an 'A' for effort ... and luckily for their fans, they went back to what they do best with their next album.

1423136802|5.0|So exited to read these books. Only complaint was that there was slight damage to the box and one of the books.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Don't let the price scare you, this mouse is worth MORE than what you pay.<br /><br />BACKSTORY: I needed a new mouse cause my Corsair M60 had the Back button completely break.  I play Guild Wars 2 and have the main attack bound to the Back button on the mouse so I use it a TON.  Eventually the spring in my old mouse gave out and a day later the button stopped working altogether.<br /><br />So I started shopping, found a good review for this mouse and decided to dive in.  First of all the DPI is insane, I'll probably never use the highest setting. There are plenty of buttons (unless you're a fan of a TON of buttons like the Razer Naga), and these buttons are conveniently placed, big and feel SOLID.<br /><br />The software is nice too.  Very clean interface, easy to setup and has more options that needed (in a good way, not a Whoa-too-many-options-too-confused way).  I also liked how I could actually use a Double-click macro (the old mouse couldn't do it), as a matter-of-fact, the mouse came with a Double-click macro as the default macro.  The profiles are stored IN the mouse, so I'm assuming the replay of the clicks is through hardware (not software), so the support for various games is high (my old mouse had issues with macro replay unless I used hardware mode which limited me to ONE active profile).  The profiles can be swapped with a button on the bottom, so it can be done during the game, just not on-the-fly during battles (since you have to pick up the mouse to do it).  The feet glide nice on the desk, but gave me a bit of trouble with the old plastic mouse pad I've been hanging onto for the last 10 years.  Also, switching the mouse to the highest polling option (1000hz) made windows act as though I had unplugged and then plugged the mouse back in, afterwards my saved profile was gone.  Reprogrammed and switched back to 500hz polling and been rolling smooth ever since.<br /><br />All in all a GREAT product, hopefully it will stand the test of time (and clicks)that I plan to put it through.  Love the product and am interested in trying out other Anker products.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Good button layout<br />-Big, solid buttons<br />-Great, intuitive software<br />-DPI through the roof<br />-Buttons are ALL repgrogrammable<br /><br />CONS (mostly just minor gripes):<br />-Feet can be sticky on some mouse pads<br />-Mouse wheel is a bit too recessed from what I'm used to<br />-The ad says you can change the LED to ANY color you want, some colors don't show up right on the mouse itself (this is a minor, MINOR issue at best)<br />-I would prefer a scroll wheel that also tilts, but I can understand reasoning against this on a gaming mouse<br />-highest polling option seems to have some compatibility issues (maybe?)
B001QFZADA|5.0|I loved this book.  I only hope I can properly apply it to my relationships, including family, friends, and coworkers.
B007MG360G|5.0|This is a great app really fun I'm twelve and I thought it was fun I liked how it was so User friendly and neat.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|The weaving of an enthralling story is still an art, and here is a perfect example. So taken was I that I started again as soon I had finished the first reading, just to make sure I hadn't missed anything, and admired the tale even more at second reading. Lovely characters beautifully drawn, scenery so real you could walk in it, and enough twists to keep you guessing right to the end!  Marvellous
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I am a huge Dave Grohl fan and I loved every minute of this documentary.  Anyone who loves music will love this!
B0023SDPS6|4.0|These books are always interesting and well written,  making them worthy.  I'll read the series. The characters are well defined making the series attractive.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Great movie to watch by yourself or with a friend or family member.  When I tell someone that I saw this movie, they agree with me on what a feel good and warm movie this is to watch.  Enjoy!!!!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|bought it for my 8 year old daughter...was one of my favorites as a good kid.  A lot different from movies she watches now but she enjoyed it.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I love sudoku.  I dislike the way summer sudoku twirls the numbers around and does not allow me to continue to put in more numbers while continuing to count off the seconds.  If not for this, i would give it five stars instead of four.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read the John Carter novels in school, they were a little dry.<br />The movie took out a lot of the draggy parts.<br />It was filled with action and adventure but also had some really good humor.<br />And of course one of the big pluses is not a lot of really crude language
B00ECUARO8|2.0|It was not the thriller I thought it would be. Way too slow, until the very end, then a big finale, boring!
0307341550|4.0|Has a more oddly dysfunctional family existed? This one teetered a bit too much on the edge of unbelievability for me. Amma was infuriatingly disturbing and disgusting, Adora was creepy, and some of Camille's actions just didn't make sense ... but maybe that was the point. While a fast, engaging read, I expected more.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I love Jonathan Rhys Myers and this show is a great addition to his filmography.  I highly recommend to any one that likes historical fiction.
B0016LTNL4|5.0|This movie had me laughing so hard. I highly recommend it. It's absolutely hilarious! It's also a great story about how a family comes together to honor a loved one. But, seriously! It's so funny.
0307913090|5.0|The book came in almost new shape.  The story creates a new world like Tolkien did in Lord of the Rings.  If you liked Lord of the Rings you'll probably enjoy Game of Thrones as well.  Haven't seen the show yet so I can't compare.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Without a doubt, one of the best versions of Emma out there! I especially like the rhythm: nothing is hurried like in some of the shorter versions. Great acting!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Well done exploration of the times and the difficulties and differences class life offered. I would recommend this to everyone
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is an awesome series that involves a little intellectual humor that I like a lot better than stupid humor like family guy or south park.<br /><br />The story plot has underlying drama, but how they close the cases never ceases to amaze me. I always try to guess what avenue they will choose and they always have a better game plan. It is truly the best TV series that I have seen in a long time. Go ahead and watch it from the beginning and if you don't like it after the first 3 episodes, it's probably not your kind of show. However, my guess is that you'll love it and can't wait for them to produce the next season!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|It looked like a new set when I got it. Worked perfectly, I hadn't even remembered it was used. Great deal.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I was playing this game earlier today and loving it until I tried to get on now and couldn't play because of a message that says I need to update it. It is so frustrating because I can't play and in the app store, it doesn't say I need an update. HELP!!!!!!!  I really enjoy the game and need to harvest my potatoes and save my sick pioneers and duck!
B0053KWDES|5.0|Excellent Headphone amplifier. High signal to noise ratio with built in Equalizers and volume control. Recharges from a USB port and lasts for hours/days. This made a huge difference in my Bose headphones. Works great with laptop or TV, etc.
B001NIA27E|4.0|A great story. Dealing with vaciltise and stuff. They did a great job making every thing very interesting and teaching at the same time.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Great collection... I remember seeing the first Alien in a theater when it came out. This is great because it has the Directors cuts. It was many years before I actually saw them. They make the movies much more sensible.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|A WORK OF TALENTED ARTISTS THAT IS AWARD WORTHY--Kenny Loggins-one of the most talented artists of our time, joining up with Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr to form Blue Sky Riders - a brilliant move. Three successful song writers unite in this award worthy CD.  I purchased it because I trusted Kenny Loggins choices in music. It is a blend-not straight country. Each song is a classic, each a realistic presentation of life experiences. Little Victories contains beautiful vocals of Georgia Middleman, and this piece will bring tears-it is a very touching expression of the emotions one experiences with a loss within their life. Gary Burr, the award winning song writer, finally gets to display his talents that extend beyond writing on stage. Then there is Kenny-that unique and amazing voice that has been presented and enjoyed in our musical history for decades. The BSR adventure is another display of the unlimited range of his talents. On the CD, \\"Dream\\" is an answer to the false impression that age is a negative factor in a person's ability.  Just Say Yes - an optimistic view of a new relationship. The refreshing harmony of these voices is perfection.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I dont know what all the negativity is about. My son and I just watched it and it was very creative, entertaining and fun. We laughed, cried and had lots of popcorn. The acting and story line were just fine. You will not be disappointed.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This was not a good app. I was super disappointed when I couldn't get anything to play and nothing worked right. It was really super slow and had to many ads.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Anytime you need a calculator this one is great to use even if you hit the ca button  it still saves it in the memory
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love this on my kindle fire HD. I also use this on my cell phone to keep an eye on this crazy weather.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Don't update when you do you can't play the game anymore. Sad cause this WAS my favorite game. Every time they update ,the game gets worse about problems.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Accessories logitech have always loved, very reliable durable, thin, long crowns and mouse use, carry around almost 5 years I uitlizando the logitech g5 and is perfect, the sound of this headset is excellent a very good response time considering it is wireless which is what necestas when you play FPS, and surround sound crazy thing is, the sound of the microphone too.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Can't believe that this is 99 cents!! If you reading this and you like first person shooting? Then get this before they raise the price haven't researched the how much you would need to spend to upgrade the game. I mean there's always some type of dlc you need. But this is worth it. Unbelievable. Haven't touch the ps3 since. For to beat this one.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|why do this games is been stuped it said failed to connect i cant go in games someone do something
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />This is my first time seeing American Horror Story: Asylum. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Loved it and would highly recommend to other viewers.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Victor Gomez
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Seldom do you get to see a perspective on World War I from the folks left at home. Then, you also get the opportunity to see it from the viewpoint of the privilidged gentry and their servants. I was a big fan of Upstairs, Downstairs, but I like the series even better.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This is an interesting speculation about the historical Jesus (as contrasted to the Christ presented in the gospels). But for readable up-to-date scholarly treatments, check out similar books by Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, Bishop Spong, and Bart Ehrman. The most interesting thing about Zealot is that the author is a Muslim convert.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a wonderful portrayal of life in an English manor house. The intricate way in which the lives the servants and the gentry are connected is presented in a very realistic and fascinating way. I was sorry to view the last episode, as I will miss the characters.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I recommend it. Entertaining, action and more. Tom Cruise good as always. Good movie I recommend you rent it. ENJOY
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|It's a talented cast but the road traveled has been pretty well worn by other films and with less of the &#34;graphic comic strip&#34; elements and dialogue.
B009J2VQSK|4.0|cd came on time.  good music.  watched the movie and enjoyed the music soundtrack.  good movie good music.  good cd
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Quirky, charming. Eminently watchable.  Too bad Syfy decided to cancel it, but at least we can watch it on Amazon Prime.
B000059HB7|5.0|My friend was looking for this DVD and I found it here cheaper than any other sites I had checked it worked great and he is happy with it.
B005FFW46S|4.0|I enjoyed the book. But the I am a fan of both Terry Pratchett and Sir Samuel. The story itself is rather pedestrian, but I have always enjoyed the WAY Sir Terry tells a story more than the topic (in most cases) any way.
B00BY8DNK6|1.0|Nothing here to see keep moving along bad sound, the guitar never really popped for me. There is better live stuff from philly
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is one of the greatest trilogies ever, and you get it here for a great price. Nice package too. I believe there are better collections available, but for a much higher price.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Really good story line and never boring . Good acting and story make for fun adventure . Great effects wish more movies with Tom were this good
B005AKFXZW|5.0|The whole concept of the book fascinated me with the intertwining of the characters and how they eventually interact with each other throughout the plot is fascinating and makes the book a great read. I struggled to put the book down and hurried to pick it up again when I could
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Historically accurate, highly engaging and a great drama. The instant video 's quality was a great and pleasant surprise to me.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I think this is a thought provoking album.  I rated it 4 stars because I couldn't rate it 3.5 (either 3 or 4) so I gave the artist the nod.  Good, but too short for my taste.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This book begins to explain a path to awareness.  It is a gift that we all can benefit from. Find your happy quiet calm joy place soon.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This app is a copycat because it is almost the same a temple run...  :( but it is fun sometimes.
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|Boring.... My granddaughter got tired of it pretty quick too. I'm just glad it was free when I downloaded it. I uninstalled it, there are way better games out there.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game for those that enjoy match 3 games, there is a degree of difficulty with time limits and locked pieces, never boring.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Love the game. But the new update won,t download and can,t play on either of my Kindles.  Too bad. Had a great town going.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey is a wonderful adventure that should satisfy every fantasy fan. It isn't perfect. This movie takes far too long to get going at the start. In particular,the scene at the hobbit hole where we 1st see the dwarves is waaaaaaaaaay too drawn out. But once Bilbo and the dwarves set out on their journey the pace picks up considerably and you are swept up into the adventure. The last 2 hours of this movie are flat out great with all the adventure. And the riddle game scene with Gollum and Bilbo is especially good. I LOVE the depiction of the riddle game and the portrayal of Gollum. The filmmakers NAILED that part. The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey is well worth watching but be prepared for a slow start. 4 out of 5 stars.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The world created by Mr. Martin is highly detailed and imaginative. The characters are well-described. I just finished Book 1 of the 4-book bundle. Three more to go.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Derek hit the bulls-eye.  A business is a great way to create your own utopia, however that may look.  Big or small.  Just get started!
B006IGZWB2|4.0|There aren't many movies that I can watch more than one time but The Help I can. Great acting and although it can be sad, a good story line. These women were awesome!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I REALLY ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME.  IT IS HARD ENOUGHT TO KEEP MY ATTENTION AND WILL RECOMMEND IT TO MY FAMILY AND TRIENDS.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|They have like one video or maybe two for an artist, the rest are live performances or interviews.  That kind of goes against the whole &#34;Watch Free Music Videos.&#34;
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I like this game, it is fun to play but it does have issues. Cash money is hard to come by and you need it to buy lots of stuff. You can buy it with real money and some systems I think you can watch advertisements and get some free cash, but not on the Kindle. You also can use cash to reduce or even prevent natural disasters. The game would be better if they just charged a little for it and got rid of the cash part and only used the coin money you earn from playing the game. What I really don't like is them putting in side quests where you either have to install another Gameloft game or spend you game cash to complete the quest. It was very hard to start because natural disasters and sick people kept coming all of the time (over 60 people sick or injured in the fist 10 day of playing), but once you get going you can stock pile supplies that you make or get from friends and once you heal/fix everything you get a 24 hour break from disasters. There is also connection issues fairly frequently, even though the device is always connected. I also found that game cash seems to go missing at times but this may be because you can spend money with a wrong tap of the finger extremely easily.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book. Even if I didn't understand some of the words or meanings, I looked it up. It's a wonderful book and so much love is going on.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|I had watched this movie many times until my child broke the disc in half...fast forward several years later...we now watch through Amazon onto our TV. No breaking disc and the movie is rich in character, story line, amazing animation and sentiment. Pixar films top our favorites list and this one may be the best.
1781162646|5.0|It was short for a Stephen King book but it was a great read and I enjoyed the story line.
0061950726|5.0|I love historical novels. I hated to put this book down, so I didn't get much done until I finished it. Now I want to learn more about the orphan trains. Very hard lives for those children.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Even without a tablet, I am able to read books because of the Kindle app for Android. I am able to access all my favorites. I bought my girlfriend a new Kindle HDX 8.9, so I will get her old Kindle. Electronics are so much fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The girls at work all warned me that Pinterest was great. That was an understatement. Pinterest is addicting. I just cannot get enough.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|My HTC One uses cloud storage, so adding this to my phone was a bonus. I don't need to download music to the phone or a phone storage card. Wonderful how technology has improved.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app, simple to use! Gives you a quick glance of the weather at the notification bar and offers weather information for more than one location.
B002UTKSBK|5.0|I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan and enjoy listening to the music from the movie. Good when you just want something different to listen to.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I like this game very much. I purchased the full game and completed the campaign quickly. Then started on the sealed deck option. Won a few matches , now the game will not open. Anyone have any ideas ??
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have never written a review before, but this was so bad I had to voice my opinion to try to save people from the excruciating experience of trying to get through this mess of a \\"novel.\\" This might be the worst book I have ever read in my life. If I could give it less than zero stars I would. It had no semblance of a plot whatsoever. The Crossfire Series was meant to be a trilogy, and it should have stayed that way. It is clear that Sylvia Day wanted to milk every penny from the success of the series at the expense of their quality. I won't be wasting my money on her work again.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed the Kite Runner the author's previous book but this one left me confused about the characters much of the time. The author jumps around from one location to another and it's hard to keep the action and the characters together.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Somewhere along the line, if you haven't seen this, someone is going to make you watch this movie -- convinced with the idea that you will love it,  They might be right if you're a 15-year-old boy, but other people might not be so inclined.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I thought it would be entertaining for myself and 3 kids to play. Unfortunately it keeps locking up my Kindle Fire. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it still continues to freeze my tablet.
B00D5EWRHW|3.0|i just liked the genre i guess, but this remind me of coldplay when they were deep and adults, you know, \\"good\\"
B00C1GBOU6|4.0|...but still pretty good.  I guess I'm too old to understand the art work, though.  As a trio (with additions as necessary) not much has been lost.
B000E41MRC|5.0|I read about the film. Then I saw movies about Nazi Germany. But this was a real feast for the eyes. If you are interested in WWII, it is a must to watch it.
B003477DVK|5.0|This movie is a  great coming of age family movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I would recommend this movie.
B000TGCR38|5.0|In Nazi occupied Holland during WWII, a Jewess hides with a christian family. The house where they live is bombed and, when she goes to a city and gets involved with the resistance. Through different sub-plots involving several men, she finally gets to Israel. Worth watching!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|My wife didn't watch it when it was on the TV so, she has 4 more seasons to go. lol
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Love Tennant, so I knew going in that I was going to like this. Didn't hurt that Arthur Darvil was also in it! Aside from having some excellent actors in it, the show itself was taut, well acted, and the story was engaging. I'm interested in seeing where this goes from here.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I'm not a big gamer but is there even any skill required for this game?  I think it's a big waste of time.
B00DP3IESY|3.0|All of these stars are for the visuals because they are magnificent. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the film. The story is a mashup of MOON and DEJA VU without the suspense of either. Tom Cruise plays the same character he always plays, only flatter than usual. We never get to see the aliens. Bummer. Be sure you see this film on a big screen because the visual element is the star. Kudos to the folks who make this film look so good.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I love this book.  It was my first one I read on my kindle.  Will read more books by her.
0316056863|5.0|First of all, love the cover and the quotes on the back.  Second, I did read the entire book.  It's great, easy reading.  The book is funny, but I also enjoyed getting the inside scoop on how she likes Amy Poehler and how it was starting out in the comedy business dominated by males.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Excellent amplifier with high sound quality, I highly recommend it and is priced gift, rather than 5 stars I would give it 100 stars. Best of the best
B0012QRPU4|4.0|One of the best drama/comedy's in a long time. I love the twists and turns, but mostly the surprises. Great job AMC.
B00065GX64|5.0|and this is one of the most suspenseful movies you will ever view. Directed by the great German director Fritz Lang in 1931 this is one film that will keep you on edge as the events unfold in the story. Starring Peter Lorre as the serial killer Hans Beckert this may well be Lorre's best acting performance and that says a lot considering what a great acting career he had. As for the director, Fritz Lang had a stellar career himself behind the camera. Best known for the silent classic \\"Metropolis\\", \\"M\\" (which would be Lang's first sound movie) might well be Lang's masterpiece. It is a story that looks both at the uncontrollable madness Beckert falls into to kill while at the same time looking at how the murders of young girls effect society as it deals with the horrors of the murders. That makes \\"M\\" just as much a psychological thriller as a suspense movie. There are certainly twists and turns to the film to. As the police become more frustrated in not being able to find any kind of evidence to show who the killer is while the public hounds them for results in capturing the murderer the criminal element in the city begin hunting for the killer as well. The police are leaving no stone unturned in their hunt for the unknown killer which includes busting up all the illegal activities the local gangsters are running in their quest to find this person. That of course is interfering with the gangsters profits so they decide to hunt for the killer too to bring him to their version of justice. The movie then becomes a race to see who can capture the killer first once both sides finally figure out who the unknown serial murderer is.<br /><br />To make this such a great experience to watch is the work that has gone into restoring the film to its original state. The transfer of the film onto DVD is outstanding. I have a copy of \\"M\\" on VHS tape that is about 20 to 25 years old. The picture on that is grainy and faded in places and there are parts to the movie that are missing. But with the work done to restore the movie thanks to todays technology the picture is clear, crisp and many of the missing parts of the film have been added again bringing better continuity to the story line.<br /><br />This is one suspense film I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who is a fan of this genre of movie. The film does come with subtitles so you can understand what is being said plus there is a second disc with all kind of special features including a 1975 interview with Fritz Lang conducted by William Friedkin. For the serious movie collector this is one film you just got to add to your collection.t with the work done to restore the movie thanks to todays technology the picture is clear, crisp and many of the missing parts of the film have been added again bringing better continuity to the story line.<br /><br />This is one suspense film I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who is a fan of this genre of movie.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the book so much. I had to buy it for my English class and I was a bit skeptical about reading it but I am so glad that I did.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|all main characters were underwritten. oz the man needed to have done something positive before reaching oz the alternative reality (or city or whatever it was); the two villans, as  well as glinda, needed more definition in the story (just labeling them evil or good was not helpful enough to the audience) - of the two evil sisters, one entered the story already unbalanced, the other entered already evil, and glinda entered already good, so audience didn't get to experience the reasons for their evil/goodness, we were merely presented with a story where these characteristics were already in play, leaving us out of the loop as to why; no way we could understand what motivated the female characters, and these are 3 out of the 4 main characters.  if we don't get the characters we won't get the story. oz the guy was self absorbed for the first act, and then he wasn't, due, apparently, to glinda and the china girl's words; needed oz to change because of story events that audience witnessed, along with us getting to see his character evolving in response to the changing events, not just because of other character's words.  two and a half stars.  film is okay for little kids, just needed two more rewrites, and a rethink of the presentation of the major characters.  serves as an example of a surface story, or rather, how not to write a story if you want your audience to become emotionally involved.  the actresses/actors were good, writing was the weak link
B004R0WKNE|3.0|Intriguing story, but a bit slow to develop. Needs a few more laughs. Grumpy Harrison Ford.. Great stars are interesting
159463176X|3.0|It was a little frustrating reading this book.  I wasn't engulfed by its characters as I was in Housseini's previous books. At first, I couldn't put it down, I was sure I was going to finish it within a couple of days. The points of view started to change and continued to do so throughout the entire book. Just when you start to understand a character, Poof!!!! they're gone and onto the next one. During these transitions, I found myself less and less interested in the weaving of these characters(some of them insignificant). I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say that all I wanted was for the two beginning characters to reunite, so I stuck with it and desperately waited for that moment. The moment finally came at the end, but it was very disappointing and not at all what i expected it to be. Nonetheless, i did shed a tear.  All in all, it was an interesting read, as I've never read a book where every character was the narrator at some point. I did enjoy it in its entirety, but it wasn't as good as &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I enjoy using this. I like the size of the numbers and every thing. It's just nice and basic. It is  as nice one.
B000WBZ5M0|5.0|This movie was all sorts of great! Ocean's Eleven was great, Ocean's Twelve didn't do anything for me, but Ocean's Thirteen is clearly Ocean's Eleven amped up.<br /><br />They leave the wives at home, they jump into the scheming (with more elaborate schemes), and there are few boring scenes. Also like that Olga Sosnovska was in the movie (was in Spooks/MI-5)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I don't know what all they hype was about the Hunger Games, but it is a good movie.<br />If you are interested in love and action, I would suggest this video.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|At first, I was hesitant to touch this film. It looked like a rom-com or chickflick. Then I saw the clips on YouTube (dinner scene, alternate ending) and it started to grow on me.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is cute as all hell in the film, Bradley Cooper does a nice job (I remember him from the Alias days), DeNero plays a decent fatherly-figure, could've did without Chris Tucker.<br /><br />This is a great Philadelphia movie, great Eagles movie, and a great movie for those that, well, believe in silver-linings.
0552998877|1.0|This is the same as Confessions of a Shopaholic.  Bought it thinking it was another in the series.  What a waste of money since I'd already read the other book.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Little background: Die Hard 1 was great, Die Hard 2 was alright, Die Hard 3 (Die Hard with a Vengeance) was watchable, and I skipped Die Hard 4 (Live Free or Die Hard).<br /><br />I felt this was what a Die Hard movie was meant to be. Over-the-top action (with very little CGI or really nutty scenes), loads of guns, loads of destruction, and villains that actually act like villains.<br /><br />Lastly, even if you read the spoilers and watch the clips, the twists and turns right to the endings are still surprising.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Interesting plot and twist to the story. I would recommend it to a SciFi fan for sure. Have a nice day.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|The Astro Slim3 external battery pack is (in my opinion) the most user-friendly external battery on the market.  The built in micro-usb charging cord makes a good product great.  It can charge my Samsung Galaxy S3 2.5-3 times depending on how low the phone's battery is when I start.  Since my sole use of this product will be charging my phone, the 6000mAh is plenty of power.<br /><br />Great job Anker.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This was definitely \\"action packed\\", but refined with a human touch. It will keep you interested and intrigued right up to the end...<br />And, my friends, you will LOVE the ending! Stay tuned, sit and enjoy!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie for being predictably sweet but full of clever one liners...<br />It really made me laugh out loud!<br />I love the minions too! Just a nice family night movie. Cute! And no sad sad moments like in UP. It stays on a silly happy pace.

0307292096|5.0|the review will be based on the design of the book, not the story. im no expert but the book looks well made, is sturdy and doesn't feel cheap in any way. there is a graphic novel in the back which i could have done without but there are maps as well as brief histories of the houses. fits well in the slip case. only complaint is that this is the only book with this treatment. none of the other books in the series have been printed in the same style. but the seller was very fast, courteous and the book was packaged with GREAT care. if you're looking to add it to a collection and worried about damage during shipping they did an excellent job at preventing that.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|[[ASIN:B0062NAX1U Courageous]] Here is another well made movie starring Alex Kendrick, Ken Bevel, Kevin Downes and Ben Davies. This one is another tear-jerker. Men will attempt to hide tears. The movie is about a group of men who develop a commitment to themselves, their families and God. Though that might not sound like much fun, the movie has a good story and a few twists and turns. Its about mending broken relationship and holding ones self accountable for action. It about passing it on to their sons and daughter. Again an excellent movie that I own. You wont regret owning any of Alex Kendrick's movies. [[ASIN:B0062NAX1U Courageous]]

0345803485|2.0|Sooo I finished this novel. I really just wanted to know what all the talk was about. I have a couple questions: They truly intend on making this book into a movie? Is Vivid Entertainment going to be producing it? Seriously, short of making this into a porn flick I highly doubt there's enough substance to this book to actually get a complete movie. This book severely lacks any form of believability.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Enjoyed the dogs and adventure.  Mystery and of course the expected love story.  A favorite Nora Roberts book for me!
B009WUBERW|1.0|Movie stopped in the middle three times and went back to the very beginning and asked me if I wanted to watch the movie.<br />Also I was only given the choice of twelve movies(one screen) and when I tried to select the green arrow for more choices nothing happened even though I tried several time. Trying to watch this movie was a waste of time and very frustrating.
0385342071|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's books! I loved this book all the way through! Her heroines are always so real, understandable, you can always count on them to do wacky things. The only problem I had with all her books are the bad language.
B00008LDPU|2.0|Having recently enjoyed the first two Matrix films (the original more so than Reloaded), I decided to continue my experience through the library. Conveniently, I received both The Animatrix and The Matrix: Revolutions (or Revelations), and so I was able to watch them in sequence. Today I'll be tackling the nine anime shorts that serve as...well, it's difficult to classify what exactly to call these unrelated mini-flicks (although a few words I plan on not using in my review come to mind). Anyway, let's begin with some background.<br /><br />The Matrix is an extremely good, extremely original action film from all the way back in 1998, but which manages to remain just as gorgeous looking today. For my younger readers, think of it as the previous generation's Inception, and you pretty much have it. Granted, there were some plot points I took issue with (most notably how the heroes go about killing the very people they're supposed to be saving), but that's really irrelevant here.<br /><br />Although I'm by no means a huge fan, you could make the case I grew up with anime, albeit of the popcorn variety shown on Tonami afternoons on Cartoon Network. Still, as I've gotten older and my interests have expanded, so has the anime I've viewed: everything from Gundam WING to most of the Pokémon series to Dragon Ball Z and the original to Death Note and High School of the Dead. I'm not really sure what this says about my taste in anime (although I might add I highly enjoy Spirited Away, proudly own a copy of Steamboy, and was rather baffled by Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke). I suppose you could consider Final Fantasy: Spirits Within and Advent Children anime as well, along with Resident Evil: Degeneration and Damnation, so I'll throw those out as well.<br /><br />The Animatrix most closely resembles none of these, considering that it's nine separate stories that aren't really even connected via anything other than all being set in the same universe. To me, it seemscloser to a collection that was certainly inspired by it, Halo Legends, although Legends was, for the most part, a more cohesive story than these, since it took place more or less all within the same forty year span. The Animatrix is spread all over the place, and never really manages to introduce any characters I found particularly memorable (there are two exceptions, detailed below). Anyway, let's dive right in and examine each piece individually.<br /><br />Continuing my Legends comparison, I have to quibble about Animatrix's order. The Halo anime started off with its origin story (called, rather creatively, \\"Origins, Parts I and II\\"), but the Animatrix starts with action, so we get \\"The Last Flight of the Osiris\\" instead. It wouldn't be so bad if \\"Osiris\\" was a stronger piece; sadly, it isn't. It suffers from the same problem Square Enix had with their previous anime, Spirits Within: namely it was populated by characters I felt no connection to whatsoever. To be fair, it seems unrealistic to expect the same studio to accomplish in nine minutes what they couldn't do in over an hour, but still.<br /><br />Supposedly this one got screened in theaters as a prequel to Reloaded. I don't remember this, but then I was about nine at the time, so it's understandable. The short starts off with what is quite possibly the worst choreographed fight scene I've ever seen, which quickly and predictably dissolves into shameless fan service as a man progressively undresses his girlfriend with a katana. We get a big, five second shot of her butt cheeks through her thong, and by this point I've already consigned this one to the \\"Are you kidding me?\\" pile, but it keeps going. Soon enough things go bad: sentinels attack the ship, which has just stumbled upon the drilling machine attacking Zion (object of the main battle in film three), forcing them to make a suicide run for the surface, in order to broadcast to humanity and warn of its impending destruction. We get some very Mirror'sEdge-esq sequences (although I suspect DICE was copying this, and not the other way around, given the years between the two), but in the end I'm just left wondering why I care. The crew's ultimate sacrifice (alluded to with a throwaway line in the second film) is expected from the get-go (plus, you know, the title),  but Enix just can't make me feel anything for them. Perhaps with a full-length movie they could've pulled it off, since some actual development wouldn't been possible, but as it stands, the cast feels mostly like retreads from the first film (we have a strong, bald, black captain, a nasally white pilot, a strong female lead, etc.). Overall, \\"Osiris\\" is a swing and a miss, despite its gorgeous visuals.<br /><br />The next piece (which ought to have been the first) is entitled \\"The Second Renaissance.\\" This is the tale of humanity's downfall, but while the art is a little wonky, it isn't the story's main problem. No, it's the fact that, after watching about a minute of this short I'm left thinking humanity got exactly what was coming. I mean, I know it's all cool and lefty to make humans the bad guys, but seriously? This is like making a movie about Israeli occupied Germany focusing on the resistance, then making another film detailing the Holocaust. It completely destroys any sympathy I have for the characters, all the more so since humanity seems to be comprised of a bunch of extremely stupid bullies. The machines (who were apparently created self-aware, since someone decided to skip step two of the Robot Apocalypse) repeatedly attempt to coexist with humanity, but humans just seem incapable of this. A particularly memorable scene involves a lynch mob beating a young woman to death with a sledge hammer while she frantically screams \\"I'm REAL!\\" It's the sort of image the reboot of Battlestar Galactica or its tragically short-lived spinoff Caprica could've pulled off, but here it just seems horrifying and unjustifiably pointless. (There's also gratuitousnudity, since the skin-job is fully equipped). The only other image that comes to mind is one of UN troops in the trenches just before the final battle, as the Pope and various other religious leaders exhort them. It gives you an interesting look at how humanity has united, but it doesn't manage to feel positive; you get a sense of the hopelessness of these guys, though, which is almost as good.<br /><br />Anyway, humanity commits atrocity after atrocity, but the machines roll with the punches every time, eventually forcing the UN to accept surrender and the Matrix. This isn't before humanity darkens the sky and destroys most of its own civilization (the machine city of 01 from Revelations, nestled deep in Iraq, is bizarrely totally accepted in the super-stable and famously tolerant Middle East). Nuclear warheads are equally ineffective (ignoring that EMPs are Zion's only hope for combating the Machines in the films), which is yet another plot hole in a short starting to look like Swiss Cheese. There's a throwaway line about liberal humans siding with the robots to demand an equal right to life (a bizarre choice considering how closely the opposite side mirrors the real-world Pro Choice movement, but I digress); after one clash with police, this group is never seen or heard of again.<br /><br />After watching travesty after travesty, the machines win, and I'm none the wiser about where the title came from, who first developed the Matrix (the Architect and Oracle should be main characters, but are never mentioned), or how the first minds were freed. I did gain a new question, however: After everything I've seen, why do I want humanity to win?<br /><br />Coming on the heels of what we just saw, \\"A Kid's Story\\" is extremely jarring, and that's without even getting into the irritatingly shimmery art it features. This one is quite possibly the most distracting art in the entire collection, no mean feat. It follows the story of...that kid who kept following Neo around inthe second film. You remember? No? Well, I didn't make the connection until after watching it. My first take was \\"This is crap,\\" and it still makes no sense for Agents to just show up at a school for no reason and starting trying to waste a kid, but anyway...Thinking about it, the story climaxes with the titular character plunging off a roof to escape the Agents, freeing himself through suicide, a disturbing message if ever there was one. On the positive sides, it features Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss (something the Halo anime was sorely lacking) and ties more or less well into the overall series, but considering the overall Judeo-Christian theology the series seems to riff off (with Neo as an extremely dark Christ figure), it irks me that the final line amounts to \\"Salvation comes from within, not without.\\"<br /><br />\\"Program\\" is similar in approach to the fight between Neo and Morpheus in the first film, but it quickly devolves into a bizarre fantasy Samurai battle that makes little sense. It's not overall a bad piece, though it adds very little to the overall series. Still, it comes about as close as anything else to being a completely flawless entry.<br /><br />Undoubtedly the worst is \\"World Record\\" which has absolutely nothing to do with the series, manages to make the Agents look extremely stupid, and is, on top of that, borderline racist. It revolves around a champion sprinter who can run so fast he actually breaks the Matrix (something that shouldn't even be possible, but whatever). An extremely unimpressive Agent (who looks like...a cheesy anime villain rather than the more or less faceless automatons they were in the series) attempts to stop this...somehow, the sprinter pulls his everything, and the last scene is of said idiotic Agent screaming at the athlete he'll never walk again. The story makes very little sense and brings not a blessed thing to the canon; it's a waste of time. On top of that, the artist has clearly never actually seen a black man: the main character looks hideous. Watching the looping one second frame on the chapter select menu, I actually thought he was some sort of monster. This is by far the collection's low point.<br /><br />Continuing the trend of mood whiplash is \\"Beyond,\\" by far the best of the lot. It revolves around a group of Japanese children who discover a glitch in the Matrix, which takes the form of a haunted house. This whole concept was my favorite one from Reloaded, and to see it play out here in this way is awesome. It reminds me very much of Spirited Away, and I'd love to see a full-length version of this.<br /><br />This one was a tough call. I first saw screens of \\"Detective Story\\" on IMFDB, and was sold upon seeing Agents wielding .50 Action Express Desert Eagles. This chapter revolves around a PI about to hang up his fedora, when he gets a call from a mysterious client, asking him to track a hacker known only as Trinity. After a little indecision (and some financial aid), the PI comes around, and begins the hunt. He learns he's not the first man for this job; three others have been contracted. One killed himself, one vanished, and the third is insane. A visit to this unfortunate doesn't shed much light, but the PI catches up with Trinity anyway...one step ahead of the Agents. I was really hoping this one would play out one way, but complete cop-out ending ruined that for me. I'd love to see a full-length version of this as well, albeit one with a different, not so downer ending that doesn't make me dislike one of the main characters.<br /><br />The final story is \\"Matriculated,\\" and it makes about as much sense as its title. While the premise is solid (Resistance kidnaps a robot and plugs it into their own Matrix, hoping to cause to empathize with them), it died pretty early on for me when the main lead doffed her space suit. Underneath she was wearing some sort of super-tight leather top, panties, and heels, and I was so distracted by my constant \\"Why doesn't she put some pants on?\\" that I really couldn't follow the rest. It doesn't help any that \\"the rest\\" consists of some extremely garish and bizarre set pieces that make no sense whatsoever and drag on for far too long. The writers ought to have either scrapped this one or shortened it; it's the longest of the nine, and it drags. Granted, Reloaded dragged too, and in places it didn't need to, but somehow this seems worse. It doesn't help any this interesting premise is never referred to again (Big Lipped Alligator Moment anyone?), which seems to me as if the Brothers Wachowski realized it was bad and dropped it like an ugly baby. And on this note, the collection ends.<br /> So, here's my tabulation:<br /><br />The Good: Well, there's something wrong with every story, even the ones I liked. I guess the best they can hope for is that they aren't really bad per say, just not amazing.<br />\\"Beyond\\" This one makes the entire collection worth a single viewing. It's the one story that can stand as anime in addition to being a Matrix short. My only problem is that it's ultimately forgettable.<br />\\"Detective Story\\" A great noir piece with amazing artwork, this could've made the entire thing worth owning but for its awful ending. A major disappointment, but I just can't quite bring myself to hate it.<br />\\"Program\\" As illogical as this short is, it isn't actually bad. It's just not good.<br />The Bad: Again, this is all relative. None of the shorts listed here are without merit, but they're just a little too off the wall for me.<br />\\"Kid's Story\\" The art and illogical nature of this story got me. The writing and acting are great; it's just too jarring.<br />\\"Last Flight of the Osiris\\" This one is nothing but fan servicy eye-candy. The art is great, but it has no substance at all.<br />\\"The Second Renaissance\\" I outlined my rationale above. Mainly, were it not for the two scenes I mentioned there, this one would be utter garbage. As is, it's disturbing and disgusting. Then again, maybe genocide should be.<br />The Ugly: Honestly, these two are equally bad. There's no equivocation here.<br />\\"World Record\\" Is pointless and grotesque. I have a hard time putting a 500m dash on the same level as the fight for humanity to survive.<br />\\"Matriculated\\" This one is just distractingly odd. It has a solid premise, which it quickly smothers with strange art and a little dab of fan service.<br /><br /> Overall, the Animatrix is a pretty weak anime collection. While some stories do have merit, none of them are perfect. Honestly I can't think of a single audience that could enjoy everything here; while some might say this is variety, I see it as narrative incohesion. It's just not something I can ever see owning or recommending to anyone else.
1476734941|4.0|Just for interests sake, this is an Islamic prophetic tradition in existence for over 1400 years.  It is a recommended practice (Sunnat) of the prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) to fast on Mondays and Thursdays every week.  Muslims all over the world follow this optional practice, however we fast in the traditional sense, i.e no food or water from sunrise to sunset.  This practice has been recommended for its many health benefits.  It is also an exercise in self discipline and self control .... Something I think is recommended in these times of excess.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|I've seen this movie over and over and I love it. Peter Sellers is my hero. One of many Stanley Kubrick greats. Particularly enjoy watching the Russian ambassador break up while Peter Sellers &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; Struggles with his out of control arm. Great cast including Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D Ripper, Slim Pickens, A young James Earl Jones, Pre Patton George C Scott and of course Peter Sellers and Peter Sellers. Mandrake and The President. Always good to watch a great movie from time to time.
B0089OBLDO|1.0|but that's not what i bought it for, i bought it so I can use a arcade stick for ps2 on my xbox. If i got my xbox 360 controller, I dont really need to be able to use my ps2 controller on my xbox 360, i'll just just the normal one? I plug it into the device and all the lights does is blink forever and none of the controls respond.

B007PT1PEY|5.0|First of all they are competing e-book kindle editions of the complete Sherlock Holmes. This heirloom edition has the clear advantage of truly being complete unlike other or practically all other e-book editions. The problem lies with the final set of short stories titled the casebook of Sherlock Holmes. They were written after people clamored for more Sherlock Holmes stories after Conan Doyle supposedly eliminates him in the short novel the last bow. Other competing editions in e-book form do not have these final set of short stories again titled the casebook of Sherlock Holmes. This can be true of a nicely leather bound book with nice not too small print from Canterbury classics. Speaking of print size it is comfortably large with even illustrations. Other editions have problems with comfortable print size. No need to play with font size here. Indexing  and table of contents are excellently done in a three volume set for ready access to the short novels and short stories. With all this going for the e-book edition and the greatness of the Sherlock homes stories what more can you ask for. A well deserved five stars.  Eric warwick

B005IQZB14|1.0|I have much respect for anyone who writes a book, because lord knows I could never do it.  But man this book was absolutely, painful to get through.  I kept hoping it would get better and then by the midpoint I just wanted to get it over with.  Most of the story, descriptions of her adventure, were just boring and the &#34;deep&#34; parts about drug abuse, death, and sex were equally as mundane leaving me without a feeling of connection or empathy.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|If you like suspense and thrillers, this book is for you. I really enjoy this kind of book. I read for enjoyment!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best app I have ever played it is awesome I played it for 2 hours straight  yesterday I was actually looking for candy crush saga and found this it it awesome
B00866H7SS|5.0|Despite the fact that this book is rather different from the books I usually read, with its explicit and sexually charged descriptions, there is no doubting the fact that it is well written. The plot is interesting, the language choice interesting and one cannot help but fall in love with the characters. True, some of these characters seem to be larger than life, but that only serves to add to their attraction, making them all the more delicious. There is never a dull moment and the book continues to grasp your interest to the point where you find it hard to put it down.<br />If you are after an extremely gripping book, which heightens your sense of romance and completely takes your mind off mundane, ordinary matters - then this is the book for you.

B00142X56Y|5.0|I bought this primarily for Simon Keenlyside's performance. It didn't disappoint.  The rest of the cast are fine. Keenlyside has been featured on several new opera recordings Macbeth and Don Giovanni to name two new'st and they/he is very very good. I enjoyed the Don Giovanni a great deal  I have many many recordings of the Don but this performance moved to the head of the line for me.
B000YAX3P0|5.0|Think what you want about her offstage (and occasionally onstage) debauchery, this girl was out-of-this-world good. In a time when music was and is so abusively mass-produced, &#34;Frank&#34; restored my faith in musicianship. Bluesy, jazzy, witty, funny, and soulful, Amy knocked it out of the park with her debut album.
B0027J4SKA|5.0|Similar in style to Diana Krall but more voice as apposed to Diana's awesome piano riffs.  A true artist bohemian.  I love her look.
B0037BB00I|5.0|Honestly, I kind of like this earlier album more than her followup, &#34;21.&#34; This album has a few of the namesake emotional ballads that fill the sophomore album, but incorporates more musical stylings--jazzy bordering bubbly pop songs complementing some downright blues. &#34;21&#34; tends to go for power, as opposed to &#34;19&#34; and its highly syncopated, rhythmic selections.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Excellent western.Well acted,great story,fantastic casting,great scenery,great production,and crisp clear quality.A true western in all sense of the genre.I personally dont care for all the cussing but the days of &#34;the DUKE&#34; are long past...support your favorite artists.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|Whereas &#34;Alright, Still&#34; seemed more personal and light-heartedly sarcastic, &#34;It's Not Me, It's You&#34; bridges out to some larger themes and offers a little more gravity to these. Don't get me wrong, it's still very much Lily Allen, it's just a little more grown up and hard-hitting.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|the game was crap and just could not get into it - don't know what all the rave is about this game.
B006FS22Y8|5.0|It's a great listen, but it always makes me a little teary to think what could have been. All in all, it's a wonderful homage to the great Amy Winehouse.
B001DF68MA|1.0|I am puzzled about all the raving reviews, and puzzled about who can fit their child into this bike seat.  The seat looks well-built, and feels good, but surely no one over 15 pounds can fit in it. Our child is 2 years old and 27 pounds, and we did try very hard to squeeze him in there.  No luck.  He sort of spills over on both sides, and the buckle strap is not long enough to buckle him up.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This was a cute movie, but some of my coworkers are obsessed with it and it doesn't seem warranted. I rented this to see what all the fuss was about and just thought \\"Meh\\". It got a little long in the middle and I would imagine young children having trouble sitting through it.<br /><br />Great acting, good visuals and a fun soundtrack - liked but just did not love.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I watched this movie in the theater, to tell you truth, I fell in love with the trailer and consider it, &#34;The One&#34;.  The movie creates a premise filled with originality, precision, perspective and the same time, is a roller coaster ride to follow, which is all the more exciting.  Compared to the Matrix series, this movie is completely different, night and day different, which goes to show why the Wachowski's are two of the best directors/producers in Hollywood because of the diversity they show in this famous flick.  it offers a story, a certain way of thinking that still haunts me (in a good way) to this day.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and own it on blu-ray, I don't think you'll be disappointed!
0385349947|5.0|This book is a necessary read for professional women everywhere.  In addition to your briefcase, you need this work to function.<br />I highly recommend!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|my fault first off for not installing this and trying it out right away. with a busy schedule, i ordered this on July 26th. so after a week and a half after receiving, i was able to finally try and hook it up to my Panasonic Viera, about 4 years old now.<br /><br />first issue: with 3 HDMI ports used up with my WDtv Live, xbox 360, and my media center pc (each device using HDMI connections). i disconnected all of the HDMI devices then connected the chromecast. i saw a red light, which looked promising, but when i turned my tv on, and switched to HDMI 3, there was no picture of the \\"set me up\\" screen. i shut my tv down, then tried both of the other ports, with no success in getting picture. my tv does not have a usb port, so i had to use the power adapter, which is fine. i don't have cable tv hooked up to the tv, so i was unsure of whether i needed it nor not.<br /><br />\\"maybe i had to install the software first\\" i thought, but then the setup failed to find my wi-fi network. \\"no big deal - it looks like your wi-fi is not turned on\\" it said - LOL. i was using my desktop to set up the software, and installed chrome first, even. my tablet can see and connect to the wi-fi at will, but the chromecast software did not want to cooperate. after about an hour of rebooting devices and reconnecting things, i may have just given up.<br /><br />might pass this onto a google-loving pal of mine to see if they can get it to work, because i don't think i will be able to return this thing. at least it has been a nice deal.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|Summer Sudoku is a nice interface for one-finger game play.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />it keeps getting hung up.  Once every couple or few games it just hangs.  Won't accept any touchscreen input for 5, 10, 20 seconds.  Sometimes I have to restart the app.<br /><br />If this were on paper and suddenly my pen didn't work, that would be one thing.  In this case, there is a timer ticking and players get a graded score that is based on time.  That makes it frustrating to try to play against the clock when you're not allowed to play.<br /><br />The interface with cues like highlighting all similar numbers that have been played is great.  Makes it much easier to solve quickly.  The spinning of the completed number/block/line is a nice cue, but - again - while the numbers are spinning the clock keeps ticking, but you can't play until the spin stops.  A better interface would pause the clock while the grid is unplayable.<br /><br />Lastly, likely as an offshoot of the hanging issue, I have also had the experience of finishing a puzzle, closing out, and then coming in the next time to see a score of, say, 20 minutes added on to my last time, and when I hit &#34;resume&#34; it goes to the finished grid.  It's not like I'm racing to turn the tablet off before the game can reasonably acknowledge that the puzzle is done.  In fact, I'm fairly certain that I'm waiting for the final time to pop up before I shut down.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good game, but it would have gotten a higher rating from me if they were to work these playabliity- and time-related kinks out.<br /><br />I'm using a Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|very very good story<br />impressive .....thanks<br />I am recommend by my teacher to read this book<br />I never regret to have read this book.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Playing this album for the first time was a real revelation. Not because I didn't anticipate it being good--widely popular singles like \\"Ho Hey\\" and \\"Stubborn Love\\" accurately reflect the whole collection. In fact, they precisely reflect the collection; nearly any randomly selected track could soar up the charts. They could have shrugged their way through the occasional deep album cut, and nobody would blame them, yet they maintain the momentum throughout.<br /><br />The Lumineers are driven by the same syncopated acoustic folk-rock sound that characterizes Mumford & Sons, the Lone Bellow, and the Avett Brothers. Half a generation ago, they probably would have gotten sold in the Country Music shelves, before C&W became insular. You can also hear influences like the Beatles, the Everly Brothers, and even Woody Guthrie in their socially charged lyrics. This inclusiveness probably explains their broad cross-genre popularity.<br /><br />If I had to pick one word to describe their themes, I'd choose \\"grief.\\" Songs like \\"Submarines\\" and, especially, \\"Big Parade\\" express the young adult's realization that the promises we believed as children were founded on optimism, not reality. Moreover, they know that what they've discovered about life isn't some mere momentary aberration; life really is like that, all the time. This translates into raw, unadorned music with muscular lyrics that don't fiddle about.<br /><br />I wish I could say that the Lumineers aren't like anybody else, but given the list I've already written, that would be a lie. Rather, they're probably the most prominent and successful exponents of a trend in our society. Rather than the cheeky playfulness of the 1960s or the swaggering machismo of the 1970s, they represent a culture mourning its lost opportunities. They speak for us, where we stand right now. And that's why we can't stop listening.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love this game...not for the simple fact that I love puzzle games but bescause pudding language is amusing. But in all seriousness this gamebis a challenge a creative challenge that makes you see stars, ice blocks and green sticky pudding in your dreams.
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|This man is flaky in a good way. The research and his ideas have challenged me to action and the good results are beginning to show two weeks later.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I might not be a teenager but I remember how awkward it was. This show is cute but too racy for most Tweens and teens.  Or maybe I'm out of touch and sex on a first date actually is a thing now with the kids. Fun for girly giggles or tourturing your husband.
0061438294|4.0|This book is very easy to read and does a good job of going over the basics of body language. There are pictures which help illustrate the topics they go over in the book. The author's experience in the FBI and his everyday life is also used to further explain the topics in the book. This is what differentiates this book from a textbook style book, which I think makes it more enjoyable to read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|though I am not a huge fan of Collins's writing style, the story in this book is gripping from start to finish.
B0036G1T78|1.0|I was unimpressed. Why did this get a good rating? I thought it was awful. Boring, and the acting was pretty bad.
B009I2UH2W|2.0|Purchased four units. Only one works but does not fully charge the phone. Of the other three; two never worked and one just works when it wants to. Don't waste your money.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|With so many products out there promising what they do its nice to receive what you expected, thank you.  No disappointing surprises.
0679809015|5.0|the intended audience is for the really young readers.  my niece and nephew love this book.  it's a small chunky board book that's perfect for toddlers' hands and curious tendencies (biting and throwing).  flip open the door/flap and see what animal is hiding behind.  make an animal sound to engage your young reader.  it's short with simple pictures but very inviting.
159420411X|4.0|This book told a lot of stories about other aspects of Nate's experiences with math and numbers.  I wish he would have dove into more math as it pertained to the elections.

0670026182|2.0|I read all the reviews before I bough it. And decided that if not precipice at least the photography will be worth it.<br />To tell the truth I disappointed in both.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of options.  Great time-killer.  Sure there are ads at the start of every game, but that keeps it free.  I love FREE.
0756686970|4.0|The book was in good condition. The only problem was the tear from where the toy had been removed.  Other than that, the pages were neat and clean.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I started watching this because I am a Henry Cavill fan.  I will continue to watch all the shows because it's just an outstanding show.  The story (very historically accurate......i think...lol) the sets, the actors, the costumes all done with meticulous care and the chemistry of ALL the actors is really quite amazing.  Henry is, of course, fab but, I am very happily surprised how much I am enjoying all the other actors.  Just brilliant.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|My favorite movie of all time.  Greatest western movie ever made, in my opinion.  I watch it at least yearly.
B00C6F624K|1.0|The &#34;Peggy Sue Got Married Blu-Ray&#34; I just received was really bad!!!!!. The Picture Quality did not compare to the standard Peggy Sue Got Married DVD. The Blu-Ray came directly from the studio-brand new sealed and was not clear-grain-poor color transfer and not worth the money. I am shocked that the studio but no interest in making this blu-ray even equal to the original dvd copy. I will trade it in at a local used cd/dvd store for a few dollars credit. It's not worth returning because of the cost of shipping.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's a very fun and addictive game, it does glitch but not to much. I'm happy with what o got I just cant get the update. It says i need to and cant play until i get it but it won't let me get the update. That's why i rated this game 4 instead of a 5.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Where is this update supposed to be? It won't let me get into the game without doing the update, but yet I go to the app store &amp; there is nothing. Will it be fixed soon??
0345475674|4.0|I will make this short and sweet. I could not put the book down. Besides being  historically accurate, it is a sexy, brilliant, tragic pageturner. Barb.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it!  Addictive and a lot of fun. Really enjoy the graphics when I win. It gives you the option of taking back a move for example if I touch the card by accident coming off the deck. It will also give you hints if you want them.  I like the score card after a game so you can try to beat your best game..

B00D23GXB2|5.0|GPA is a man who has taken hold of the world as if it were a blank canvas and on its surface has painted his portrait in words of passion and grace. This is the strangest book I have come across in a very long time. And there is nothing wrong in that. In an age of dreary sameness and manic graphology, a time when words spill into the air as rain in the monsoon spills from the sky, it is a rare thing to come upon something original. And entertaining.<br /><br />GPA has constructed an erotic autobiography in short powerful poems that draw you into his world until his narcissistic claim of being The Greatest Poetic Alive has about it a ring of transcendental truth. Being a gentleman, as he says, GPA doesn't provide readers with the names of his lovers, even his own is veiled in initials. Instead, he allows his words to drill into our imagination like woodworm in soft pine. The first poem in the anthology is called 15 Minutes - and, in that time, on meeting his lover, GPA takes us through a minute by minute cycle of sensual touches, warm kisses, dancing tongues and a glimpse of souls. Read the first and you are hooked.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Excellent scripts with plenty of surprises.  Very good acting by all in the show.  Very nice to have dialog scripted on screen.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It is really good this app is free because it just won't download. Black screen with add in the corner is all that it is but it looks like a really fun game and I wish it would work.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I haven't really had a lot of time to check it out but what I have seen so far it is a great App. I trust Amazon enough to probably bet it will be 5 star!

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I'm sorry to say that I had never heard of Neil Gaiman before I read The Ocean at the End of the Lane, but now that I have, I plan to read more of his work! I didn't know what to expect when I bought this book, but I read a few reviews and everyone seemed to really like it, so I decided to try it. I am so glad I did! It has been a while since I've read a book that was able to make me actually feel the emotions of the character in the book. I felt everything the boy in this book went through. I was transported back to the summer in the book and became this little boy, and I went through everything he went through. Even though the events of that summer were fantastical, they seemed totally feasible. My only complaint is that the book ended way too soon! Read this book, you won't be sorry!

B0046B3QTG|5.0|There is enough in this movie to keep kids and parents entertained.  I did not see most of the humor the first time I saw this movie, but the second time, LOL.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This book moved quickly and was a great read.  I had felt one of the other books was slow and left me uninterested but this was just like the beginning ones and didn't disappoint at all! Never wanted to put it down!
B00DH773IA|5.0|Another great album from this band.  Although it is weird hearing John playing with a strat/tele tone, great album and grooves
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|These books are different from the originally published editions, right? I couldn't find any confirmation of this anywhere but I suspect it's true.
B0055OG2BC|5.0|First off, it must be said that the 1967 version of CASINO ROYALE is either a film you like or you hate--there's no inbetween! Almost everyone I know who has seen it is either mildly amused, or they just don't like it at all. I can appreciate this, because the film really only makes sense after multiple viewings and some research of the subject. Even the most diehard Bond fans, of which I count myself among since an early age, usually dismiss this film. This film, however, takes on a magic all its own, and after 25 years since I first saw it, it is the only Bond in my personal top ten, and the only Bond film I will own on Blu-Ray. Other than being a one-of-a-kind film experience (and on the big screen it is breathtaking!), there are some facts that are indisputable--it IS a big mess, casting ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous, the idea of multiple James Bonds turns many people off (look at the billing in the end credits), the script had too many people working on it, and the overall film had too many directors to work properly. The problems are legend! But, this film has a lot going for it as well...David Niven is, as usual, his delightful self as Sir James Bond, ringleader of what is certainly a three-ring circus! The cardre of women in the film (less Bond Girls, more Characters)--Ursula Andress, Joanna Pettet, Deborah Kerr, Daliah Lavi, Barbara Bouchet, Anna Quayle & Jacqueline Bisset--all turn in lively performances that keep the action moving. In many ways, because of them, this is sort of a women's picture. Collectively, they have more to do than the Bond Girls normally have to do. The music is not only one of the finest scores of Burt Bacharach (amply aided by lyricist Hal David, Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass, and Dusty Springfield)  but one of the best EVER written! The standard \\"The Look Of Love\\" was written for this film--and nominated for an Oscar! The production and costume design are eye popping, and need to be enjoyed at least in a letterbox format. Blu-Ray takes the look of this film to a level I don't even think the film makers would have perceived in 1967. In conclusion, just try it, you wont regret it...EVEN IF DANIEL CRAIG IS YUMMY WITH A SPOON!rmat. Blu-Ray takes the look of this film to a level I don't even think the film makers would have perceived in 1967. In conclusion, just try it, you wont regret it...EVEN IF DANIEL CRAIG IS YUMMY WITH A SPOON!
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|Not sure who had more fun watching Nemo, my kids or my husband. Suitable for the entire family.<br />Loved everything about this movie. It's awesome!!
B0092S4WLY|2.0|No instructions as to how the game is to be played no fun at all for my grandson and he's really good at games.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|When I turned on the game this morning it said the game needed to download additional memory to my device. After doing so, it said there was a new version and the only button that shows up is &quot;go to App Store&quot; when I go to App Store there is no update button. Only &quot;Open&quot;<br />. Now every time I open to try and play, it just tells me to update to new version, but never gives the option to. Very disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very addicting game. Great graphics, lots of things to do, and a surprising number of my friends play it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Can't wait until i get into Season 2.  Love watching all the seasons back to back.  Play is great on my TV
0061537934|5.0|Fantastic story of relationships from the eyes of a dog.  Many references and analogies to racing, but you need not be a race fan to enjoy and appreciate Enzo's observations.  Difficult subjects and situations through much of the book, but doesn't life bring those to us all?  Enzo deals with them and helps his family do so also.  In the end, it's all about taking care of each other.

B008EZVNO0|5.0|Love Van's music - his voice is not as perfect as in his youth, but still the Van we know and love!
0142420891|5.0|Full review on Reader's Dialogue: [...]<br /><br />Both books each tell about a single day, but they have lots of flashbacks and memories so the character's entire story up to that point is told as well. I loved this style, especially in Where She Went, because I got the feeling that everything that happens on this one day is directly affected by what happened before, that everything that happens in a person's life is linked to everything else.<br /><br />The music laced around the story is also really great. Especially in Where She Went, when some chapters are prefaced by an excerpt from the lyrics Adam wrote about his heartbreak. Funny thing, though, at the end of If I Stay, Gayle Forman says she can't write lyrics and so appropriated published songs for her fictional characters and bands. But in Where She Went, Adam's lyrics are obviously original - so who wrote them? Just wondering.<br /><br />Mia's story, and her choice, in If I Stay is heartbreaking, but even in that book, I felt more of a connection to Adam. And Adam's story in Where She Went broke my heart into tiny little pieces and - thankfully - mended it together at the end of the book. I think that the magnitude of Mia's choice is shown more clearly in the second book, when she and Adam have a sob-worthy conversation/argument/soul-baring about what went down between them. Absolute heartbreak!<br /><br />Basically, highest praise from me - the books made me cry multiple times, and my heart ached the rest of the time. If you haven't read these yet, what are you waiting for!!
B000002KAT|5.0|Van at his best....I listen to it nonstop and will continue to do so.  Also got his latest one and love that too
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I love the die hard movies! This one was more action than plot. Usually the bad guy targets John and his family. This 'bad guy' does more running away. Action packed, John always finds new ways to take down helicopters :)
B006LXQID8|5.0|This is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  If you like movies of transformation, with some quirk and whimsy thrown in for good measure, you should enjoy this film.  It seems totally original to me.  Amelie, played by Audrey Tatou, has been damaged by life's circumstances, and because of her resulting sensitivity she is able to intuit the needs of different people she knows and meets and supply those needs in unique ways.  To sprinkle their lives with a touch of magic and whimsy.  When watching it, you realize that life needs more whimsy and silliness.<br /><br />Audrey Tatou is simply enchanting as Amelie - and yes, she is very Audrey Hepburnish.  It's hard to imagine anyone else playing this central role with the same aplomb and gamine artistry.  The book is more character-centered than plot centered.  If you like linear plots, it will probably frustrate you.  But if you like small intelligently sentimental vignettes, the movie should reach your heart and delight you.  I found it totally charmante and can watch it again and again.  It's a little work of film art.  And how refreshing to have an upbeat film with an affirming message.
0062278096|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, a huge Sherlock fan, and she loves it.  Great book for any fan. But it!

B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the app before the recent upgrade. It used to be easy to see the information and it had included the UV index throughout the day. It no longer has this feature and I really miss it. It is now not possible to jump on real quick and check forecast. Wish it hadn't changed.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show! This was a good quality DVD set and the extras are worth it.  I bought the DVD set before I owned a Blu-ray player so I will probably replace it with Blu-ray eventually but not because of any quality issues.
B00881VLCE|4.0|its an ok puzzle app, but once you work the few puzzles that are there, then if you want more you have to purchase other packs. i do not like this at all
B005LAII4E|5.0|I loved this movie in 3-D in the theatre! This isn't the 3-D version but the quality of the Blu-ray plus the extras were great!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|unbelievable, Loved it so much. The Doctor explained his experience so well. If only we had that much love in this
B000FCKGPC|4.0|So you have probably just finished the amazing A storm of swords. This one isn't like that. You can notice by the page number (almost half of the previous book) and by who are the POV characters here. It is a slow reading at times but still unpredictable and interesting things happen as always in Westeros and Essos.<br />Just keep on reading... Amazing 5 books in total.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Our group has been reading Marcus Borg, N.T. Wright and James Tabor. I found Dr. Aslan's book very helpful in explaining what would likely be historically accurate for the period in which Jesus lived. I thoroughly loved the book.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Finally, after reading all of the books in a row I got to this one! And it didn't disappoint.<br />What else I can say but, read it, enjoy in it, and try to stay away from spoilers.<br />Can't wait for Winds of Winter :)
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the character development and plot line.  Sci-fi fans will love, as will others too!  Was hooked from the first episode.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I really did like this book. It was well written and easy to read even though it had been translated. I wasn't overly happy with the ending of the book but it was still a great book.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|This CD is unique and passionate.  I do not get tired of listening to Sinead O'Connor.  My husband and I enjoy music that is not main stream and look for artists that don't give up their art for popularity or money.  Her music speaks to you.  Very enjoyable listen....every time.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|The transmitter works as expected.  It does drain the ipod's battery but not enough to interrupt a 1-2 hour workout.  I have not tried it on other apple devices such as ipad or iphone.  I am a little concerned with the small size as it tends to lose itself on my cluttery desktop....lol
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My daughter loves it, my granddaughter loves it.  My kindle has become the family kindle.  I never knew so MUCH could be done on this little device
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Wonderful app for wireless printing. Got a new position that required a lot of printing.  This App saved my life...
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you are looking for all the HP movies and hoping not to spend a billion dollars on them buy this! It doesn't have a ton of special features but who cares if you just want the movies. I did a lot of research on which set to buy and the only other option woulda been about $300... for special features and a cool case thingy. Definitely worth the $44!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Same loop others are experiencing.  Go to Ap Store.  Open.  Go to Ap store.  Open.  Can't play at all.  I' m at a pretty high level and REALLY don't want to start over!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love to play this one the monkeys are crazy but I love to free the birds .my grandchildren love it too
B0079TQHDO|4.0|thoroughly enjoyed the 2nd part of this series by jeffery archer. there was one chapter that i was a little uninterested in but that was a personal opinion
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I don't like this one that much is not fun to play and I don't understand it I will keep trying
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|what a way to finish this series<br /><br /> .left you wanting more .can't wait for<br />the next book .hopefully there is one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play minecraft A LOT and I have tons of world's. Get this app!!<br />I am so addicted! Survival and creative, both are VERY fun
B0038P59A0|5.0|This movie is pure entertainment from the very first scene to the last. I refer to this depiction of Holmes & Watson as 'alternate' because the characters aren't quite in line with Doyle's depiction of them in his brilliant novels. But, the actors do maintain the essential elements of Doyle's characters. The unspoken friendship love, and loyal bond between them. The incomparable deduction, and awareness capabilities of Holmes, with the human element of not always being right. Robert Downey gives this figure a lively jolt, that makes him more 3 dimensional, and believable. I really like Jude Law's interpretation of Watson. He is anything but a buffoon without a clue, as so many others have portrayed him. This was well worth the instant rental fee I paid. In fact, this would be worth owning on Blu-Ray.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I love the hero's of Olympus series! I love that it has some of the old characters from Percy Jackson and some new ones. I also love that it picks up from the end of Percy Jackson.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Daft punk's entire new album does not disappoint- no one else is doing what they do. Good amount of dance and thoughtfulness in each song. Cannot recommend this song or album enough!
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I liked this movie a lot more watching it a second time.  Danny Boyle's near-future tale of a daring mission to reignite the Sun's thermonuclear reactions with all the remaining fissile material on Earth--and solve the mystery of why a predecessor mission failed.  Good effects, storyline and acting.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I know I haven't learned even a third of what it can do, but what I have learned I really love. Being able to synch my journaling and notes across all my computers and phone is, well, a gift.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|While remaining faithful to Cap's origins and legend as outlined in Marvel comics, this Hollywood tale also added additional details to bring the Super Soldier up to date. Great start for this American icon and for what I hope is just the beginning of more great Captain America motion pictures to follow.
B005LAII4E|5.0|this movie was sad and i think the guy in the mustash is going to be in evry movie in the word i loved it complitly good
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Epic, intimate, and unforgettable. The individual voices written by Brooks are the stories of ordinary people thrust into an unimaginable horror, and still survive; scarred, bitter, yet triumphant.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This book is similar but different than Harry Potter series and it is very enjoyable and took me only a few days to read it I would recommend this book to anyone who likes myths and legends along with the gods.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great fun app and my 6 and 8 year old love it. I recommend it to anyone with kids.

B00D5YNQWM|1.0|This title is a -1 Star. I see Aerosmith is still doing the same thing once again, You Gotta Move. Give us a complete full concert without an over produced production, thxs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This games is so fun and you get to have with I cute minion&lt;3 so cool so great and cute you get to have fun with your own minion and dress it up like a mom or Dad or the baby everyone loves
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After vesting time and money to read the first (2) books of this series, I was completely disappointed in Sylvia Day and how this book ended. There were so many unanswered questions, the storyline took a turn and went totally off track, and overall was a terrible read. Do not waste your money. I will stear clear of Sylvia Day after this experience and I suggest you do the same!!!
B003NX75B8|5.0|These two authors make an interesting team. John Green has a humorous style that makes his Will Grayson a love able dork. The accompanying author David Levithan's Will Grayson is a damaged soul whos journey is touching.  this is a great story.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is definitely a different style of game play than their normal games. I however don't like having to buy items for the game, it's very frustrating. The collections are fun.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has once again written a funny, touching, and intellect story for the young adult crowd and anyone else interested in a good story. For anyone fromilar with John's works you will have come to expect nothing more.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The only thing it is really good for is the current temperature.  I hope that's right.  It is not very user friendly.  The current maps aren't current.  It's just not good.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I wear my watch 24X7 so self winding works well. Seems to lose 2-3 minutes over the course of a week but I am fine with that. Good looking watch and the crystal is showing no mars or scratches after 2-3 weeks of daily wear including banging into walls, doors, etc. etc. I was initially going to simply replace the band on a Indiglo Timex that keeps great time but whose plastic crystal is badly marred but value at $60 dollars was hard to pass up for a Seiko. Only wish is better visibility in the dark (I got the Indiglo for a purpose....).
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It was fun until an update needed done now I can no longer play. Every time I go to pay it sends me to the app store.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun and cute and the kids love it.  Reminds me of subway surfer a bit.  I would recommend it.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I like the pages manager app as it allows me to view, work on and post to my page much easier than having to constantly go back and forth to add content when I want.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Ok it's not as awesome as Mass Effect but the music and style had me thinking about it the whole time...<br /><br />Good movie, Tom Cruise even though he gets flak for speaking a scum company Walmart or is into Scientology, he really is a good actor.  You have to watch this closely and watch the details.. no spoilers but the ending made me go &#34;WHAT?&#34;.  Some parts of the movie on the acting side from Tom's 'teammate' made me cringe at times (being totally honest.. not that I can act...hate to critique when I can't even act myself but it was tough watching a few scenes..)<br /><br />Generally Sci fi movies that are &#34;good&#34; are rare and a few friends said this movie was weird.  These friends being the general movie types who go to a movie just for a ride at a roller coaster..don't care much for details just want to be entertained..so for those types I'm not sure if I would recommend but if you are into science fiction movies; this one is a good one..I enjoyed it and the story was shown in a unique way.
030758836X|4.0|This book reels you in and never lets you go.  I read it white-knuckled all the way through just waiting to see how it was all going to turn out.
B00555X8OA|4.0|I really liked this book. The introduction is long and dry and doesn't do the content of the book justice. It turned me off the first time I picked it up. However, once I was through it I found the content of the book enlightening and perception-altering.<br /><br />Kahneman relies on years of research to support the organization and operation of our mind. What was most convincing was the statistical analysis that challenges our approach to intuitive perception and how our unconscious prejudices fail us (the author includes himself in this flawed belief).<br /><br />While the concept of our automated thinking systems (system 1) is nothing new, Kahneman supports how active thinking (system 2) is often lazy or duped into letting system 1 do the thinking. The interaction of these two systems can make our perception of reality questionable (Did you see the gorilla?). His use of statistics to demonstrate our unconscious bias is convincing.<br /><br />I had particular interest in this book from a Zen practice point of view and found myself integrating it into daily system. System 1 can be an accumulation of habits and influences from childhood that continuously fly beneath the radar. It has been curiously valuable to observe how thoughts and compulsions seem to rise from nowhere (system 1) and the resultant resistance when I engage awareness (system 2).<br /><br />It's a long read. If you are a slow reader like me, it could take more than a few library renewals to finish.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i loved them.  that is enough words so let it be.  love it love it love it love it lover
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved the story and the characters are wonderful! The book could use a bit of editing but the basic love story is great and I'm anxious to read the rest of the series.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|this product was good before out of no where theres no sound coming out of the headphones. i would have to play around with the cord at one point for the sound to come out like i was trying to get cable playing with a clothes hanger.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the series - great acting with a remarkable insight into British aristocracy and service life at the remote houses.
0812550757|5.0|A Wonderful read in the series, you should read it now before the movie comes out and the price goes up.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I just downloaded the game on my kindle. I played the computer game and thought it would be fun playing the game on here. Before I can even get the game started it tells me to download the newest version. I don't have any option other than open. So how do I update the game if there is no update? :(
0143034901|4.0|Was looking for a good summer vacation read and was intrigued by the premise posed by the author that the selection of a book could have life altering consequences.  The hero is buoyed by friends and acquaintances, and plagued by villains as he attempts to learn the true fate of the selected book's author.  Bravo Carlos Ruiz Zafon!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. I mean it is just beast. If you ask me what the first free game that you get should be I am going to say subway suffers.
B007HPO3CC|5.0|I purchased this product used, however when I received it ...it look like and operated like it was brand new ...plus it arrived on schedule
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have been on this 6 weeks and lost 17 pounds. It is the easiest diet.. or non-diet I have ever followed. The more fast days you do, the easier it gets and I look forward to them. I still have 90 pounds to go. looking forward to it.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|This is excellently done. It is a favorite story told beautifully. I cannot wait for the next parts. I am sure it will remain a classic always.
B000000XBC|5.0|I love CCR and this cd fits in with the rest as a collection. Very good cd with a couple of songs I didn`t have. Would recommend.
0307950654|4.0|P.D. James, declared by no less a source than the NY Times to be England's \\"most talented practitioner\\" of British Crime Fiction, makes a departure from her contemporary work to visit the world of Jane Austen. In Death Comes to Pemberley, Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett have been Happily Married for several years and are the Parents of two Young Sons (and Heirs). Elizabeth's impetuous sister, fans will recall, is married to the roguish and ever unfaithful George Wickham, who is Decidedly Not Welcome at Pemberley. In the course of arriving as uninvited guests, Wickham becomes involved in the death of his close friends, which takes place during a stormy night in the Pemberley woodlands. He's accused of murder, of which even Darcy refuses to consider him capable. Soon Wickham will be on trial for his life.<br /><br />Ms. James is the consummate author, and she does a more than creditable job of channeling the Regency era among the aristocracy. The plot is simple, and Darcy is no Dalgliesh, but it's a great pleasure to follow the course of this charming story, which does capture the tenor of Jane Austen's fictional world. The Darcy marriage is, of course, idyllic, and he never neglects the opportunity to declare his love for his wife. He calls her Elizabeth, but we don't know what she calls him, as I can't recollect ever seeing her use a name. Fitzwilliam? Wills? Billyboy? Fitz? Alas, we'll Never Know. I'm generally Not Fond of books in which authors confiscate the Famous Characters of others, but in the case of the brilliant P.D.J., I've made an exception.<br /><br />Nothing short of Delightful.
B001AKTZPA|5.0|CCR is my favorite band of the day and this cd is very good. It had a couple of songs I didn`t have on it. Would recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book left me sobbing and broken in so many wonderful ways. Can't recommend it enough, but make sure to have your tissues handy.
B007TK77QE|4.0|shows how people interact and how entanglements and character comes to the fore and how w are all connected in an intangable way
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I loved this book! I am always a bit concerned when I start reading one of Mr Follett's books and see the extensive list of characters at the beginning of the book. I worry that I will never be able to keep everyone organized in my mind. However, the characters are all so well developed that it is really a simple task to remember who is who. I love the time period of this book. Times, they were a-changin'! The people were passionate because you just never knew if that would be the last.
B008Y768XO|4.0|Great true story about a dog and his master and how loyalty plays a part in life between an animal and his owner.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|While I liked the first two books of this trilogy better than the final installment, I thought this book did a good job of tying up all the loose ends. I was sad to see the story come to an end because I had come to enjoy the characters immensely.
B002FOQY2M|4.0|Not as commercial as their latest but I DO like it very much!  I brought it to work and popped it in the computer and just let it run - a few times...  Sometimes you don't get the full flavor until you've done that.  I really like it!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I am a new Ken Follett fan and am in the process of devouring his works as quickly as possible! The characters in this book are believeable as real people. They have flaws and they have strengths. They grow as people and they throw fits when they don't get their way. I love that! My great great grandfather could have been a character in this story. I can't wait for the next book.
B001B6EAOY|5.0|I really love this it works well and dont have any issues with it I got to have it and when I first use it was so easy and till this day I never have a problem with it
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I admit it. I'm a sucker for the young adult, utopian tales. I think what really draws me into these books is that they all showcase the indomitable human spirit to be free. This particular book does a good job of portraying the guilt that a person can feel when the survival instinct kicks in and we do what must be done to survive. How do you live with yourself when you've betrayed what makes us human? Do we even want to survive that way?
B004LLDN3A|5.0|We just watched this with our 2 and 5 year old granddaughters who were seeing it for the first time.  They were enraptured and have been running around singing the songs ever since.  (My wife and I enjoyed it too)
B006LXQID8|5.0|It brings about a certain amount of hope to the human race.<br />You have an eccentric girl who never fit in that finds joy in helping others in her own unusual means and along the way, finds someone who is just as strange and travels a personal journey where as a young woman, she has to overcome the difficulties of typical social norms in order to pursue her own happiness.<br /><br />There is a certain innocence that is inherent in the main character, Amelie, that is almost taboo to adults who are expected to conform to their surroundings. It is that eccentricity that brings about the funny bits and the angles she has chosen to help others, and in some cases, her feelings of hopelessness that most would have chosen to ignore.<br /><br />It is difficult to not smile towards the end.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great soundtrack, obstacle courses, bananas and more fun for everyone. it isnt that easy but it isnt too hard and it never gets boring. i got my wisdom teeth out yesterday and this is all ive been doing on the couch :P i recommend for anyone!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Definitely the best puzzle game and worth paying for. The music is relaxing and the different materials used are beautiful.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This a great book. Helps you understand more than you will ever know on your own in your relationship. I now know the live language of my partner.
B007SGM084|5.0|The Fifty Shades trilogy was one of the best sets of books I've read in a long time. I loved the details and the story line. It was very hard to put these books down.
B00D1DBO1C|4.0|This had all the specifics that I was looking for in a calendar app.  It's easy to update and access.  I can see all of my appointments at a glance.  Lots of different &#34;view&#34; options and reminders.  And it was free!  Very happy with this one!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great story right from page one-good relaxing read when you need a change-a master story teller-one that you'll wish didn't end.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|It's Unbelievable! Gary Moore nails it! What a shame he is not still here to help us get our Jimi fix!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love this CD, especially the duets with Jennifer Lopez and Edith Piaf.  The entire CD just puts a person in a great mood!
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I love Susan, Derek and their band. These are truly good people. When you see them you just feel it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very enlightening book. I had always suspected the historical integrity of the New Testament, especially the Gospels. Thanks to Reza Aslan, I now understand that most of the Gospels are pure fantasy fiction, and also understand how this came to pass. This is a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone who wants to get a true historical perspective on the life of Jesus and how his message was embellished, exaggerated, and turned into pure fantasy in The Bible.
B0085HWZDK|5.0|Saw the concert. Being a hard core Led Zep freak, I was skeptical. The music is really unique. I love these guys.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was an amazing read! It was fun and exciting and scary to. Loved this book awesome awesome book
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great game, agree with all the great reviews. The only downside is, it costs two tokens to play a game. You only earn one token each time you win a game. Otherwise you have to buy them. There is the chance to &quot;scratch off&quot; one of three free cards and win up to four free tokens that is supposed to occur every 45 minutes, but it is very sporadic. Some days I don't get any scratches, and if you get one and miss it, it doesn't wait for you - you have to wait for the next unpredictable one to come along. Guess I won't be playing much.  I did notice there is a special Kindle version that costs 99&cent;.  The free version plays just fine on my Kindle.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have read other books by Hosseini and expected this to to be the same,  but it was disappointing.  The story really didn't go anywhere for me,  but there was,  as expected,  great detail.  At  some points  there was too much  detail.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Harry Hole is one of the best characters in literature.  Nesbo is awesome with his twists and turns.  A lot of good info about many things.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|I cannot believe how fantastic this movie was! No critical persuassion needed, it is that good. The acting is flawless and the entire movie is captivating with a graceful integrity in regards to the subject matter. A must see!!!
0882847953|5.0|The first best book to have of course is \\"Stick Control\\".  This book is an absolute must for anyone wanting to use \\"books\\" to help them learn how to play the drums.  Used in combination with \\"Syncopation\\" and diligent practicing, you can become quite proficient in using the sticks.<br /><br />Playing on a set of drums is another matter.  To do that you need to know how to get around the drums and play beats and so on.  For that, you just have to get on a set of drums and start playing.  There are books that will help you for that.<br /><br />But, if you want to have good \\"chops\\" (ability to play) to be able to play those things around the drums with any kind of skill, you need some technique.  These two books will give you that.<br /><br />You can apply these exercises to the feet also.  By substituting your feet for the hands in different places and playing rides on the cymbals, you can get different kinds of rhythms and fills.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />In Stick Control you can substitute the right hand with the right foot in the exercises.<br /><br />In Syncopation you can substitute the last notes of some exercises with the bass drum or fill in the rests with the bass drum.<br /><br />The ideas are limitless.<br /><br />One more point.  Just playing them is one thing, but playing them up to Buddy Rich speed is another.  Obviousy the exercises are going to sound completely different depending on how fast you play them.<br /><br />So, I suggest these two books to start with:<br /><br />1. Stick Control<br /><br />2. Syncopation
B00E3RFKMY|5.0|What is there to say. He is brilliant. I wish that there were more people like David Garrett making beautiful music.
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|I simply wanted an app for watching my Amazon Prime videos.  Your link indicated that you have such a link that you were prepared to allow me to download.  Instead, I had to download your Amazon Mobile link, which is NOT what I desired.  I remain unable to locate the ability to watch my Amazon Prime videos and have a useless Amazon Mobile app, which I will uninstall at my earliest convenience.  I do NOT appreciate the misleading links that you posted.
B002B3D2TU|5.0|Saw the PBS Shows and Love listening to his music. I wish that he had more CD's available. Oh Well.
B003I55BIA|4.0|It was pretty good.  I would recommend it for light reading.  I liked the ending - even though it was not a surprise.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is the most complete single collection of Metal Gear games to date. The only omissions are Portable Ops (and PO+), AC!D 1 and 2, and Ghost Babel. Honestly, only die hard fans would likely be interested in those games, so that doesn't detract from this collection at all.<br /><br />The version of MGS4 included already contains Trophy support, but it does not include Metal Gear Online as the service has shut down. This is true for every copy of MGS4, sadly. I am hoping MGSV has plans in development for longer-term support of its online component.<br /><br />The other disc is essentially the HD Collection disc, with the digital graphic novels added. It took me a little while to realize that the graphic novels were in the Video section of the XMB. The HD Collection includes Metal Gear 1 and 2 as well, but they must be accessed from Metal Gear Solid 3 HD.<br /><br />This is clearly a repackaging of previously existing assets, but I don't think that's enough to outweight the sheer amount of content included in the collection. It's another great excuse to play this great series.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I have not been able to get any document started and therefore have not be able to use the font package.  Maybe I'll like it more when I figure out how to use it.
B004I744AS|3.0|the application is easy to use, not phenomenal, but the interfase is quite good.<br /><br />Buying the pro version is a must since you can dowload the dictionaries data base, so that you can have offline acces to the dictionary.<br />Also is quite cheap the pro version it is worth it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|When you journey with Neil Gaiman, you never know just how far away you will go - only that it will be an amazing, funny, scary, sad, and memorable ride.<br />This is another gem fated to become a classic. The story begins innocently enough with an average man returning to the place of his boyhood. Then WHAM! You're off down memory lane in a souped up race car with no doors, windows, or brakes.<br />The characters are vivid, familiar, and relatable....until the magic starts...then the familiar morphs into the the unpredictable.  To say more would spoil the fun.<br />If you've read Gaiman before you understand, and you will gobble up this book!<br />If you've never read Gaiman, please prepare yourself for some amazingly entertaining and memorable stories.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have become obsessed with ncis after rediscovering it a couple months ago. I watch atleast two episodes a day and its the part of my day I look forward to. Its really great stuff!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|people, I have bought the set on so many platforms and I continued here. I liked all of the extras on the three extra discs. Definitely added to it for me.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The action and special effects were pretty good but the story line was odd and the ending was pretty terrible.
B005LAII4E|4.0|I liked this film a lot better than the original, and I am happy to hear that there will be a third movie. I don't understand the death of Duke, especially when the role is played by Channing Tatum. He is huge right now, so why wouldn't they want him for the next? I don't care about Tatum, but Duke was always my guy in the cartoons!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Slow start...slow middle...then it got interesting....and couldnt put it down or was thinking about it when I wasnt reading it; have started Day Two book now....Our book club is reading it; not a book I would have picked up on my own, but am glad I did... :)
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I was behind on all of the Marvel films, and I have liked them all so far. So far so good.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I really love this program and I have made it my primary listening choice. I am very glad that I found it.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Not exactly what I expected when I bought it, but it makes a pretty good summer reading.<br /><br />Nothing to do with the movie, though.
0810989956|5.0|Perfect for our 9 yr old - kept her busy reading, writing, & being creative. Would also be good for 2nd graders through 8th graders.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Rented for our sons birthday. He was really pleased and happy that we could rent a movie and watch it through the kindle fire HD.  Well we were aslo.  We have never done that till now.  We really enjoyed that!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When you start reading, everything seems kind of nihilistic and gritty. Hazel is a bitter person waiting to die. The twist at the end is: she's still alive and not leaving scars. Augustus makes her beautiful to the reader and Gus is the catalyst for change in her life even if her lungs suck at being lungs. John Green's writing is epically impact full and dare I say ridiculously quotable? I highly recommend reading this book and doing so with a highlighter on hand.
B00AYR2FQ6|3.0|I LOVE the first 3 or 4 songs and play them over and over but the rest of the album hasn't grabbed me.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|While the writer is a Muslim - the book - is consistent with the historical Jesus movement.<br /><br />I should note that I was raised as a Roman Catholic. Our sect of Christianity, unlike Protestantism, is based on there being a middle man between Jesus through the Holy Sacraments. While Protestantism is based on a more personal relationship with the Old and New Testament.<br /><br />Hence Protestants logically may see this book and the historical Jesus movement as blasphemy.<br /><br />I don't have a horse in this race.<br /><br />But the Roman Catholic New Testament is different from the King James bible. Not so much in content, but in terms of openly prefacing the four Gospels, Acts, Paul's letters, the four apostle books and Revelation within its historical context.<br /><br />In my mind, the author, has made such prefaces more understandable to the masses. He also has made the historical Jesus movement - most notably Dominic Crossan and other Catholic theologians - more understandable as well.<br /><br />Like all things that hide within plain site, Catholic theologians, have long understood, the Gospels are not consistent. They know when they were written and how to explain them within historical context.<br /><br />The only primary research we have is the New Testament and the Jewish writer Josephus. That is a fact the author and Catholic theologians like Crossan agree on.<br /><br />The only important thing is that the religion has lasted for 2,000 years. Whether it is by divine inspiration or not, is immaterial; real people were inspired to write the New Testament.<br /><br />Meaning the entire historical Jesus study is one of curiosity; Christianity? An undisputed history of thousand of years.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book - not for inspiration or sowing doubts - but because it is way for all Christians to truly understand the New Testament they profess to being the most important book in their lives.
B005PK57IK|5.0|It all started with season 1 and it just kept geeting better! Not sure if it's the composure, sexitude, or chemistry that the cast has but I love to watch Alicia Floreck and Will together as well as Carrie and Callinda. Always good entertainment!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Predictable plot but good movie anyway. With digital backgroung, all filmed in a pavilion,  they probably had pretty good bottom line... :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't pit it down! I have read all 3 of her books and I just love the way she writes. It's a great read and you will completely loose yourself in it!
B00B9ZBZ2C|5.0|Gripping story.  Interesting having the perspective of a socialist rather than looking in from the outside.  Story line was quite believable.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am an 8th grader and read this book for the first time. Needless to say, I loved it. Placed around the French Revolution, this was a classic tale about love, loss, friendship, freedom, and faith. This lovely piece of literature has been loved for generations and I strongly believe it will be loved for many more.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl was a hard book to read when you have had mental illness in your family.  It demonstrates the dilemma that mentally ill people (and their families) live with ... that they must recognize their problem and voluntarily submit themselves for treatment,
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I realized I was crazy about candy crush when I tried it for the first time and couldn't stop playing...it's really addictive.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|This is another family favorite. Even mom and dad enjoy this movie! We enjoy watching our Amazon digital copy immensely.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The writing style is a little strange and took a minute to get used to. After that this book was glorious! Tragedy, triumph, joy, pain, love, hate; it explores them all and weaves them into something magical.
B0093Q9YNQ|5.0|This movie is classic and timeless. My husband, who isn't a musical fan, even likes it. I think we are going to make watching this movie a Fourth of July tradition in our home. It's really one the whole family can enjoy . . . . and sing along with.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|This movie is fantastic. Mel Brooks is a genius. Still relevant today. R.I.P. John Candy. Rick Moranis is always great.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|The scoring seems tricky on this game, but we have fun just pulling it out and creating one of the pictures and then guessing what it is. We use all our Legos, not just the ones included in the game, and everyone draws a card, picks a picture they want to create and we all build at the same time so no one is sitting around waiting for a turn. Then we try guessing what was built when the time is up. It is a fun, family game, at least the way we play it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This was Tarantino's best work.  This movie has a great story, lots of action, and fantastic acting.  The only negative is it is almost 3 hours long, but you barely notice because of how engaging the movie is.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I am not an anime fan, but my children and I love Ponyo. It is a touching story that reminds me of the story of the Little Mermaid, but without all the evil or more mature themes. The sweet little girl fish innocently loves the little boy and turns into a human. We like the music from the show and the illustrations are bright, happy and so sweet.
B000021Y77|5.0|I wonder why the TV networks show the same movie that was on two other networks just last week, when there are gems like this that never get played.  This is one of those neglected foreign movies that nobody's seen, but everyone will like.  It's the kind of movie I like to show to friends.  You might be able to find it on the internet.  The problem is that will be in German with subtitles and they'll insert commercials.  On this DVD, you get a good English version that is better to watch.
0316789720|5.0|This book is for all doodlers. I picked this book up to fill some summer time when it is too hot outside to play. It keeps our 8-year-old busy for hours.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This book was great. Bronte is an amazing writer as we all know but this book is my favorite.<br />It is a tale of love and life. It is not a gooshy child like love tail.<br />An amazing read!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I'm a BIG ALIEN fan so this was a no brainer for me.  Awesome visuals  and art work again from Giger.
B0001I561E|5.0|My granddaughter loves it so her grandmother is happy. Only negative- it is not blue ray. Was excited that it was available
B001993Y2C|5.0|Love the series and the packaging is original. You can display the box with lid up to view favorite characters.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game I really fun and addicting.  If I were you I would buy this game in a heart beat!
B004VFN7BE|4.0|How does Harry Conick Jr look so bad? I had forgotten he was in it at first. Although plenty of serial killer movies have been done, I still find this one suspenseful. One of my favorite movies!
B009R659L8|5.0|Loved this book.  It had me guessing until the very end.  I was surprised at the twist at the end.  I liked the relationship the two sisters had.  There were enough characters in this book to keep things interesting throughout.  I would recommend this book to other mystery buffs.  Another great read from Mary Higgins Clark.
B00004R99F|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and was so excited to find it and watch it with my 3 year old. She loved it too!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series.  Cant wait for season 4.  Each season get a little better and more exciting.  Like the change in characters.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This is another file that has a feel of timelessness.  Maybe the clothes or cars might date the film, but the content and the actors do not.  Alfred knew how to string a suspense moment into three minutes.... Do not forget to breath.
B004L3AQFG|4.0|127 Hours is one of the better movies I have seen in the last few years. A climber falls and gets his arm stuck. He can't free himself and the film shows his experiences over 127 hours of agony. It never gets boring, manages to tell a simple but believable story and allows you to empathize with the main character's plight. Camp and comedy are avoided here in favor of an effectively dramatic performance about one man's ordeal. What struck me was how easily anyone can relate to this situation in some way. I'm surprised more people haven't rated and reviewed this little gem. It got 6 Oscar nominations but only managed to break even at the box office. The picture and audio quality are superb in this release. There is 103 minutes of bonus content.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/MPEG-4 AVC   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround<br />Special Features: Audio Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending, Featurettes, Short Film, Digital Copy<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Just listen to the stunning tone on George Harrison's distinctive, sinewy electric guitar in \\"Savoy Truffle.\\" Hear how it cuts through and complements the rich bed of low, distorted saxophones. Listen to Ringo Starr's inimitable tea-towel-draped tom fills during the solo, as Paul McCartney's rich bass weaves and pumps along under the song. Hear how the organ floats into the background of the bridge (\\"you might not feel it now...\\") and the final verse. Note how the beat stutters at the start of the verses, then how each verse builds up to the release of its chorus. Throw in some effortless harmony vocals and some fearless use of studio EQ... dammit, this was analog, and this was The Beatles. We shall not see their like again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|...and this one is so beautifully told: how decisions and non-decisions change the future of family members and those yet unborn.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions are super cute and the game is really fun and I love the party zone 1out of 10 . 100,000,000
B005COO1X6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this single.  Was almost sorry to finish it. A good read especially for the small amount I paid.
0857207520|2.0|This book was quite disappointing. I do not like the way the author portrayed Henry and Elizabeth's relationship. By all accounts they were quite happy and very much in love. She portrayed him to be abusive and rapist. I do not like the tacky attempts at foreshadowing like with the quote \\"a great Elizabeth Tudor will rule this country one day and be the best ruler.\\" How ridiculous, she would never have dared say such a thing. Those were the days women didn't rule but the author clearly wanted to make the character seem as if she had some divine sense or whatever. The book contradicts many historical facts. For one Elizabeth of York never met the imposter of her brother Richard, Perkin Warbeck. Though in this story she does and recognizes him to be her brother. Also this books starts off with Elizabeth being her uncle Richard III's lover. No facts to prove that whatsoever. I find this story overall to simply be a fantasy and I warn no one to read it and believe most of any of it to be true!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Started out a little improbable, but it really worked out well in the end.  Great acting by Lawrence especially.  Go see.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I love this app and Wikipedia. At anytime I can satisfy my curiosities or settle disputes. Finally a way to prove me right!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|And enjoy the acting and drama. Archie Punjabi is a favorite. All are good. It's fun too when you recognize the legal actions and the scandals. Great show.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a really good story. I hope no one as devious as the wife 'Amy' reads it, food for thought about the perfect crime. I really wanted her to be caught, it's a tease to have an open ended thriller I know, I just like closure. It's a personal thing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved the characters, the plot kept me guessing and it was all so full of atmosphere.  I strongly recommend it to lovers of SF as well as anyone looking for a story that's really different.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I found this interesting a little bit hard to read sometimes as it needed concentration with changing from one person's story to the next but it was definitely worth reading - thank you
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Gave the DVD to my mom and kept the BluRay & 3D versions. I love the graphics in this movie and my TV is perfect for 3D.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Every time I try to watch a video I have a HUGE banner over the entire video it is really annoying!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I really like watching this movie on those days when nothing on Netflix  or amazon seems to peek my interest. Really good movie!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I tried to download it never got ot boo f-----g hoo caveat, caveat  emptor pity the fool here I sit
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|I really dig this move, it's got a great cast and story line isn't hard for anyone to follow. I recommend this as a movie night movie!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the digital display easy to use and haven't been late to work no more since I downloaded this app!$$
B001F7MSFM|5.0|Love the Hellboy movies. The cast is great and the story line is easy for youngster to follow! Plus he likes cats!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Worth the watch tho not as great as I'd hoped for action. But def worth watching! Cheers to y'all! Boom!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|After reading my first James Rollins novel, I was hooked!<br /><br />I had eagerly awaited the release of Eye of God and purchased it as soon as I could.  Rollins, as usual, delivers on the fast-paced, action packed adventure I have come to relish.  I absolutely love the richness of historical, relational and scientific information he weaves into his books and can't wait for his &#34;Fact of Fiction&#34; at the end of each Sigma Force Novel.<br /><br />I highly recommend Eye of God and am now eagerly awaiting James' next installment in the Sigma Force series!
B003B02OQ4|5.0|A very captivating read.  I couldn't put it down.  The only negative thing that I would say is that Mark, the main character, was too mature for his age.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|I've had my RAZR MAXX for a year and a half now and have never run across a free or paid app that would actually reboot my phone randomly. That is,  until today.<br /><br />That sort of behavior will not be tolerated, no matter how good your reviews are. Back to the cloud you go, Core Dive...
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Usually I dislike real-time games but I decided to give Wonder Zoo a try because it had great reviews. Im so I happy I did too because it's a ton of fun and there's so many things to do. Love the game
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Have always been a Stills fan since the 60's.  This compilation is ABSOLUTELY SUPERB!  In particular, disc 1 containing vintage Buffalo Springfield tickles my ears and my mind.  To have recaptured that on this disc is awesome.  Ah, what memories.  Oh, the rest of the discs aren't bad either.  Buy this set and prepare to go on a nostalgic ride.  What an artist!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Windows Experience Index, Phenom X4 965 Overclocked to 4Ghz, the rating is (7.5) vs FX 4100 Overclocked to 4Ghz somehow its (7.3), On the Experience Index. But the Phenom 45NM vs FX 32NM, still cant tell a difference in the performance. It also does everything almost in a blink of an eye. which is still fast for a older CPU that is easily overclockable. but i can understand if you want to be up to date which is OK. but I think its worth the buy. But if you plan to overclock a whole lot like me... get aftermarket cooling like i have. because you don't want to risk of being in a hot environment one day and frying your CPU which almost happened to me, 80C on a testing bench with the stock cooler in a kinda hot room with no AC on for a few minutes .  ALL of them are that way on a testing bench with a stock cooler, in a room with no AC, unless its winter  or if you have a fan blowing on the motherboard to take away that heat the CPU fan is blowing back on the CPU, that the CPU is creating  :-). sorry if i type too much.  I would recommend this to a friend, or a son, for a wife, even for a dad, and last & but not least, a mom.. :-))  My Specs are:<br />MOBO: MSI 970A-G46<br />CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 965 OC 4.80Ghz 100% stable<br />GPU: NVidia GeForce GTX 650, Soon upgrading to two GTX 650 ti boost in SLI (EDIT: I now have a XFX AMD R7 260X for a cheap($139.99) temporary upgrade... and I like it a lot!)<br />RAM: 12GB PNY DDR3 1333 OC to 1630Mhz<br />PSU: Corsair GS700<br />Case: Thermaltake V3 Black AMD Edition Gaming Chassis (EDIT: I Now Have a CM Storm Scout)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Tails off a bit toward the end of the season, but starts out so well that the slight drop in quality/believability can be forgiven.  Can't wait to catch up with Season 2.
1781162646|4.0|Well, the guy can write, even when he isn't being all that serious about it. It's just effortless, clean, clear and not all that heavy. Not menacing either, or scary or even all that depressing, it's just Mr. King tossing off a thriller with a few really nice passages.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Kinda gory,  but an interesting twist on the original Hansel and Gretel movie by the Brothers Grimm. The rest of my family liked it.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|What is the point of having a photo editor app when you can not save it to your gallery. I downloaded this app ass the free app and because someone said it worked on their S3- LIED! It may (or may not) work great on a kindle but I don't usually carry a tablet around with me much less use it for photos. FIX ASAP
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Excellent app ! I use it almost every day it's so much easier than the website!!!!! I have it on my iPhone and now my kindle !!!!
B007BLCGNU|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. Dicaprio did his usual excellent job with the portrayal but the movie moved in molasses fashion through a disjointed back and forth (and often confusing) past future mode. Don't really care if J. Edgar really was gay but this theme was over emphasized.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|No wonder this was a &quot;free app of the day&quot; yesterday in the Amazon app store: it doesn't work!  I was so happy to see that a photo app that normally costs $4.99 was free--proof once more that if something seems too good to be true it probably isn't true.  Well, the app is not only not worth $4.99 it's not worth anything at all.  Once you have wasted your time fixing your picture it doesn't get saved nor does it get posted to Facebook although it goes through the motions of being posted.  The developer, unless dead, should be ashamed of him or herself for ever charging for this junk.  As for Amazon: I love you, but you should be even more ashamed for wasting your customers' time with this garbage.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Once you've seen one episode you can't wait for the next.  Excellent all around series.
B002VECM6S|5.0|A must see for everyone.  Great true story that is told in a tasteful manner.  So glad that we bought it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great little game, had my brain working hard a couple times to solve. Would love to see more levels. Props to the author.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|loved the game until I couldn't play anymore. window would pop saying go to app store for update and there was never an updated app. I could never enter the game again after that.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Incredible acting and moving story. Simply amazing that it is a true story. I don't know how Naomi Watts didn't win best actress for her performance.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Hard to follow although a good ending with some surprises.Tom Cruise is typical Tom Cruise while Morgan Freeman is great as usual.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I got this app for my kindle fire HD because, YouTube supported Adobe Flash Player and the kindle fire HD does not support Adobe Flash Player. Anyways, this app is just like YouTube and I the only thing is that they don't give the video description and you cannot comment, (I don't have a YouTube account so...) You cannot create an account on this app also sometimes it takes a very long time to load great app.
0790729369|2.0|I bought this for the soul purpose of using on my laptop. It will not play as it is not compatible with the US region setting on my computer. Big bummer. It is fine in a regular DVD player, but I would have paid a little extra for a Blue Ray had I know this was the case.
B001GMQALY|5.0|Before 50 shades there was 91/2 weeks. You will enjoy if you liked the book. The control the Mickey's character has over Kim's character is deliciously naughty.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game<br />Very really uses your brain great game for while you wait places like doctor waiting to pick up kids etc ...
B00422LESO|4.0|Thought I would read the book before seeing it on screen, glad I did. It was an easy and enjoyable read.
B000I9VON0|5.0|I never get tired of this one. Such a fun movie and you can't beat this cast! Sad to think of all the projects River could've done.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Even the little ones were able to amuse themselves with this one.  It's enjoyable for the older kids also.  Would recommend this one.
B00DU74U74|3.0|It's not a great movie, but it served it's point.  I liked the book better, and I would watch the sequel if there was one.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app. makes email on the kindle fire a breeze.  I can check, reply and delete messages.  Well worth downloading.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I found it boring and labored. It was a waste of my time. I would not recommend it to anyone I know.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is a great app if u are away from home or don't have an alarm clock. I love it!!!!!!!!!
B0089LOG02|3.0|I enjoyed the book but found the ending predictable. I was,however, enlightened into the historical fact that such children did experience this life story.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The plot was mysterious, acting excellent, relatively good action, with good emotional component.  Ending was reminiscent, somewhat, of Independence Day.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I know that some of the other reviews complain that you have to pay money but that is only true if you hurry. this game is meant to last a long time and it is great
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|An excellent read teaching us the importance of IT in the business world today. It deftly blends concepts from Lean manufacturing, Agile, and team dynamics into a narrative that truly describes the life of IT operations. May become as important to IT as The Goal was to manufacturing.
0345529057|4.0|I have watches the show on TV and was told that the books were very good. I have not had a chance to start reading them yet.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|App is great until you update it. Then price for everything goes up.  They do not increase energy amount f of  level. Unfair.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It's a really funny movie. It has action, laughs, the animation is great and has a good message for the kids. Highly recommended.
B00DS2GBJG|5.0|I have to say .... I like THIS album better than some DREAM THEATER albums. The songs are catchy & melodic , great playing too . Sometimes I just get BORED of the long 10 minute DREAM THEATER tunes , and want something more .... Catchy I guess . I find no flaws here . Excellent songs excellent playing . Buy / Download this !  If you like melodic metal .... also SEEK out these bands here on AmazonMP3 :  Fates Warning --- Threshold --- Magnitude 9 --- Kamelot --- Devin Townsend
B003U6BE8I|5.0|This version was the same price as just the DVD at 9.49, which was awesome and a no-brainer. Arrived quick as usual. Always a pleasure buying from Amazon.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|If not for the fact that this truly is the BEST bingo app. I've experienced i would have deleted it shortly after i got it.<br />BINGO BLITZ has EVERYTHING!I enjoy the many options, the graphics the speed and the odds are all note worthy. However, the customer satisfaction leaves much to be desired... Ive had so many credits disappear its maddening.<br />Overall though it is extremely entertaining and to date is 1 of the 2 apps that i actually put actual cash money towards.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I'm a huge fan of comic books and I just loved this movie... I've watched is so many times... I would recommend this as a must buy...
B00AESN8XY|1.0|Can't win game. Even if 80% of population dead with only a 5%% cure game ends saying hosts dead and you are defeated.  They just want money.<br />Could be good if not for greediness . Pass on this and save your<br />Money . It gets boring. Especially after 50 games with most of world dead and you still get shut off as having lost.
034580404X|5.0|I loved the series and would recommend anyone to read the series... it's a very quick read and didn't take long to finish...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg you have to get this game it is so addictive if I could rate it higher I would it is hilarious
0439023513|4.0|loved reading this book... I did like the series and was quite pleased at how fast of a read it was...
B003WE9TU8|4.0|My main disappointment is that there was no scientific explanation of the virus that caused a person to turn into a zombie so quickly, or how the virus came about.
0439023491|5.0|loved reading this book... I did like the series and was quite pleased at how fast of a read it was...
B00873GRU4|4.0|With the technology that was evident in this society, I could not understand why there were no lifts built into the silos.
0439023483|5.0|I was actually suprised how much I enjoyed reading this book... I finished it before the movie even came out and just loved it... it was a fast read as well...
B005IQZB14|3.0|I was excited to read about another experience of the PCT, and was happy to find so many similarities to my own. However, I had been reluctant to read about someone's tough life because of my tendency to say, \\"Just get over it.\\" And I (heartlessly) said that to myself quite a bit throughout the book, skimming over sections of descriptions of how the author had been so selfish in the past. I always wanted to get back to the trail life.<br />But... I went in with expectations that weren't fulfilled, which is my own fault. An easy read, seemingly directed to women who daydream of hitting the reset button on their life by doing something adventurous.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I read the books first but still enjoyed watching the movie... I would recommend this to anyone that liked the series...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Yes! The update came and everything works on my bionic, even my wife and son razor maxx cast with YouTube on the tv and they do not even have the app for chrome cast. Works well on the desk top.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I can not stop watching this movie... I just absolutely love this move and recommend to anyone to get it...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the twists and turns mixed in with historical events. Recommend to anyone to likes to think about how it would be to live in another time and place.
B006L4MWVE|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY love this movie... I haven't watched it in a long time but I always recommend any of my friends that haven't watched it to watch it...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mincraft! it is really cool because you get to make it your own and do whatever you want with your world! you can also have as many worlds as you  want and the worlds are really big!
B001OGPUQ8|5.0|great group from my past loved them and now. they where an awsome group and alwas will be among the greats
0470913029|2.0|I was put off by the introduction which demonized &#34;fad low carb diets&#34; and highlighted the worst aspects of it in an effort to set the Paleo Diet apart.  It felt like they were targeting the Adkins Diet without naming names and referring to the induction phase done in the worst way possible.  If you know the Adkins Diet as well as the different phases of Adkins then you will agree that this is misleading and I felt, dishonest to the reader.  Again, I felt that they did this as a tactic to set their diet apart, which is essentially the same, but does not restrict more sugary and starchy fruits and vegetables.  I think the Paleo Diet book is good for someone that is new to adopting a whole foods way of eating, however if you are a veteran, you will not find much new in this book.
B002FTLWYM|5.0|Devoted fan and loved them as grew up in high school. one album I couldn't pass up. Now I have one more good memory to remeber
B00CFA222M|5.0|A totally enjoyable movie. Good acting, good script, and good special effects. There are a few holes in the storyline, but it's a fairy tale and there is less character development since everyone already knows Jack. Family friendly despite the habits of the giants, and a feel good atmosphere. I will enjoy this movie for years to come.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Have had the game stop at level 51 three times..now it stopped telling me it has new update on Appstore....NO UPDATE GAME IS STUCK ON UPDATE SCREEN GOES IN CIRCLE FROM STUCK SCREEN TO APPSTORE AND BACK...please get this fixed.......
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Not your fluffy fairy tale cartoon. This was the way the Grimm Brothers meant their tales to be told. A little bloody and dangerous with fast action. The weapons and tactics are out of synch with the time line but not a major distraction.
B000VIPJKM|5.0|I love legally blonde. It's a movie that's a pick me up for me and reminds me that my so called 'flaws' can be my biggest attributes and talents.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It's a fun game but after this new update it tells me there's  anew update I have to get, and I can't play it anymore because there is no update
B002Q9MZF6|4.0|i expected Netrebko and Villazon to give us another memorable pairing.  They have been so memorable together that it is painful to report they are only so-so in this mose recent effort.  Yes, the voices are beautiful enough and the two of them sing well throughout.  But the singing simply lacks the lustre it had on other occasions when the two of them just seemed to inspire each other.  I really haven't heard Villazon since the beginning of his vocal distress and I was pleased to hear the lovely voice was not entirely threadbare, that he could match Netrebko beautiful sound for beautiful sound.  I'll continue to hope his voice regains the refulgence of another year and we will have a few more of his patented performances stamped with charm and grace.
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|good love it a really cool show like it a lot  good story  love it a lot nice  movie .
B0002VFXFE|5.0|10 degree drop on my cpu temperature after using this. Recommended to gamers and those who enjoy HD movies on computer.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have seen the play 4 times, the movie with Liam Neesom, and this one twice.  I will probably watch it many more.  LOVE IT!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved this book and cannot wait until the next one in the series.  Absolutely one of the best books I have read in years!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Personally I am always skeptical with Quentin Tarantino films (I either completely love them or despise them). Luckily, I completely loved Django Unchained. It's comedy, drama, action/adventure, all rolled up into one amazing movie. Basically, you'll laugh, cry, and cheer before it's all said and done, and I could not have enjoyed it more. Best line ever: &#34;I like the way you die, boy.&#34; Classic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoyed it and was very pleased to find the third season available on Amazon. I found it to be both dramatic and humorous.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best series that I've had the pleasure of watching. The contrast between the house staff and the family is incredible and it truly gives you a better understanding of the various classes. Excellent!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does exactly what you want. Simple calculator like the good old days. Nothing fancy. If you want a calculator.. I would download this.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|All summer long my daughter has been telling me she &#34;needed&#34; this movie. She was surprised with it and we both have watched it many times.
B006C45MRE|3.0|Can't say it had the best plot, hardly a new one really. But the actors steered it away from being a blunt B movie...  Craig was very convincing and Olivia Wilde a pleasure; though I like Ford much better as Indiana Jones. Though it has its predictability, I did get enough into it to scream at the TV in suspense. Comparatively, being an &#34;alien&#34; movie fan: its good to see once.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app it's so cool on Apple app store it's free but it only has original and this one has Zen arcade and multilayer (and of coarse it has original too) I LOVE THIS APP
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun... you earn points to unlock new games and ots addicting to make the point goal. i do reccomend this game and when you get it... reveiw it... cuz u get 250'000 points... bit it does get boring after a while... but it is fun... get it...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This has better graphics, better control, better power-ups, better everything. I still say the first was more challenging because you have to buy &quot;save me&quot;s and it was worth earning high scores. But this one is still really awesome
055358202X|3.0|Meh.  Compared to the first three books, this was a letdown.  A whole lot of pages with not much really happening.  Omitting several major characters completely.  Hoping the next one is better as the series is starting to drag.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|There's less adds, easy access to everything. I just can't click a picture and save it. Or have multiple chats open at the same time. But it's awesome
1565234243|5.0|this book came on time as predicted. The book was in excellent condition and very informative, images are colorful and instructions are descriptive and easy to follow. I will be an amazon client for life...
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is an exciting fun filled game that is great for friend activities. I lost all of my uno cards a while ago so this is fun for me to play again
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Endearing characters I fell in love with and rallied for their win. Makes you think differently about people with a terminal illness ;no matter their age. Brilliant.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This bingo game is fun to play because it's fast and then you don't realize how much time has passed.
0060574216|2.0|This book really proves that you can fool some of the people some of the time, all of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time. We are really gullible when it comes to reading the work of PHDs, and deem them all to be authorities. This book did not enchant me, nor did it teach me anything worthwhile. Rather boring and sexist. I can't truly recommend it as a good, informative read.<br />Ester Shifren, Author: [[ASIN:1479165387 Hiding in a Cave of Trunks: A Prominent Jewish Family's Century in Shanghai and Internment in a WWII POW camp.]]
0515153656|4.0|In the book's prologue the author sets down a history of himself and explains his basis for the character Jack Reacher. Unlike most prologues this one is a must read as it guides the reader in understanding Reacher as well as the mis-steps the author makes in his narrative. Lee Child is greatly influenced by John McDonald and Travis McGee, and sets forth to create a protagonist who is a man's man who does the things that in our fantasies we would like to do. Child accomplishes this with solid writing and a well paced plot. For what it's worth, I'm not a huge Travis McGee fan (not a detractor, I just could never connect with the character) but I can certainly see McDonald's influence at work and that is not a bad thing. The author is from GB and has no personal knowledge of the States but does a surprisingly good job of describing Georgia, an area I know well.<br /><br />The down side to the book is the author's ignorance of specific story elements and his obvious lack of research or collaboration with anyone with knowledge. None of the issues are game breaking but certainly take the reader out of the experience a bit. For example, the author imagines Army MPs being elite troops with extra special combat training. This is simply not the case (nothing against MPs, I won lots of poker money from the cops in the barracks) and the character's background would have made more sense had he been a Marine or simply had an interest in hand to hand combat.<br /><br />The author seems to be completely lacking in any knowledge of firearms or ballistics and butchers the story pretty badly in this area. I try no to be too critical in this area as I work in the firearms industry and have access to people with decades of experience with firearms: but really, just how hard is it to make a few phone calls or do a Google search to learn the basics? A sub-sonic 22LR does not leave a gaping exit wound... the bullet doesn't exit at all, thats part of the whole reason to use them, after allthere are sub-sonic 9mm and 45 ACP rounds that do more damage and are as easily suppressed. The 22 calibre has a long history as an assassin's weapon.<br /><br />I recommend the book as great escapism written by an author who really can write and I intend to read the next book in the series.
B0002HZHXG|5.0|My youngest son just turned 3 on July 28 and I bought him the Tow truck. He has a blast playing it. When I saw that you can add lights and sounds I had to buy it. I just recieved it few days ago and it was super easy to install. he has a blast playing with it and pushing the buttons. Sometimes at 6am I can hear him from his room pushing the buttons. Lol:)
0802130208|4.0|I never heard of John Toole's novel until I read a piece about the novel and its New Orleans locale in an airline magazine.  Intrigued, I downloaded it to Kindle.<br /><br />\\"Dunces\\" is one of the most realistic depictions of N'awlins since \\"Streetcar Named Desire.\\"  The rich dialogue is in a variety of New Orleans dialects, such as the \\"Yat\\" dialect and Negro non-standard English.  The novel centers around one Ignatius J. Reilly.  Though educated (through 10 years of college), Reilly is a pathetically fat (who suffers with a faulty pyloric valve), lazy, and mean-spirited person who still lives with Mom and exist on the edge of poverty.  He fancies himself as a political philosopher, but is more obnoxious buffoon.  He's part Thomas Aquinas and part Curly Howard.  Each and every interaction with society involving Ignatious results in fiasco -- albeit with comical consequences.  Take his hilarious escapades as a hot dog vendor in the French Quarter (a sign on his cart reads \\"12 inches of Paradise\\").  The supporting cast adds to the novel's rich characterization.<br /><br />The book is kind of \\"Seinfeldesque.\\"  It's about ordinary people doing what amounts to nothing; but we find hilarity in this minutae.<br /><br />\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is an intriguing read that rewards the reader with a rich, mirthful tapestry of the New Orleans of the 1960s.  As Ignatious might add, \\"It's a Pulitzer Prize winner, you Mongoloid.\\"
B003F5NSTW|4.0|Very confronting & rather depressing, well written, thought the beginning was too &#34;wordy&#34;.  Raises the Nature or Nurture question, think it was a bit of both in this case,  not the way I would have raised a troubled child like Kevin.....but then how would you interact with a child like him, think he loved his mother too much and was quite spoilt.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Awesome quality and design<br />Fits under your plane seat<br />Terrific product<br />Nice pocket design<br />Study quality what you expect from this manufacturer
B005HEPS6A|4.0|One of the best Star Trek episodes ever but the streaming of the video is awful, it may just be my internet connection.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game on my kindle and it has never frozen. I like daily challenge you can play for free and it's easy to accumulate tokens. I feel it's the best bingo game for kindle.
B005AVIZ6U|3.0|Well ,another Jack Reacher novel.Once again he is above the law and never gets to go to jail serving out rough justice,story was lame and the forever descriptions about walking over railway tracks and various streets was boring to say the least.The sex has been given a boost and is now more like 50 shades of whatever !!![Is this to titilate readers ?]<br />A very disappointing story what he gets away with in the Pentagon is definitely pre 911.<br />Don't think i would read another,he has had his dash for me.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love it. It looks great, has a great feel, and wakes me up. It's also good for reminder alarms. I use it for everything.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Great Series.Great Price. Only 1 DVD is hard to watch - the Motion Picture. All others are timeless and a must to have
B001NLKXK2|5.0|But it is also very interesting. It is about a woman who becomes ill with early onset Alzheimer's.  While I was reading it, I thought of Alice every time I forgot something.  More to the point, I greatly enjoyed the story and enjoyed learning about the disease.  BTW, I am too old to get early onset Alzheimer's.  Which is a relief.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very Good App to use, and offer a wide range of Bible texts. It is helpful, but sometimes can be a little user unfriendly to NEW users.
B000QK90CI|5.0|This is a must watch, and has been for 20 years.  Entertaining whether you like motorcycles or not.  In fact, you will want one after watching this.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book was awesome even though they're some boring parts it was great. Great job Paulo Coelho. It was awesome and I was blown away at the end.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Playing this game for years and it's still a favorite.  Love introducing it to new people and watching them get addicted.  So well balanced and fun and the expansions are a must have as well.  CATAN!
B00A44HRG2|2.0|City Cameras would not load the site, and doesn't label the cities correctly! This App is hard to understand too. So do not, I tell you, do not get this app!!!!
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|The controls should be a little better I but other than that the game is pretty fun, not bad for a game to pass the time.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book had no believable characters or plot and I bagged it after the first 10 pages. Total waste of time and I would never read another book by this author. Regretfully yours,
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is the best but now I'm not so sure. I can't update and I can't play ANYMORE. Getting upset. I don't want to  stop playing but if it doesn't get fixed I will have to select.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I really enjoy Minecraft pe; but I'm upset with the fact that ipod got 0.7.3 today and we still haven't received 0.7.2 its not fair. IDK if its mojang or amazon but someone or something needs to fix this.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Great albumn, highly recommend! The songs are great. Listen to it all time. Great singer, well produced. Would buy all over again.
0399162097|5.0|Absolutely loved this novel - it left me with the \\"wow\\" that I've experienced only on rare occasions (think \\"Poisonwood Bible,\\" \\"A Thousand Acres,\\" \\"Let the Great World Spin,\\" \\"Crossing to Safety\\").  This work is more accessible than others I've compared it too - but it shares the greatness of combining a compelling storyline/set of characters, total command of structure and language, and profound insights about (human) nature.  I read this book already knowing \\"the spoiler\\" - that in no way diminished its power and actually made it more interpretable.  Also, I really appreciated the science and historical commentary in this book - from what I can tell, all or nearly all of it was completely accurate. In short, if you want a riveting journey of joy/sadness and multilayered reflection, take up this book.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I absolutely love this album!!! I seriously can not wait til he comes out with a new album it's about due that he does. The company I bought it from kept their word it is a genuine autograph from paolo himself so happy I got it to add to my collection.
034580709X|4.0|I'm a big fan of the Harry Hole novels, and I'm glad the publishers finally saw fit to release the first novel in the series in English.  Since this storyline has been used as reference in other of his books, it is good to finally have access to the \\"case file.\\" Not quite as intricate in the plotting and does seem to meander from time to time. If anything, though,  it gives us a glimpse of how far Jo Nesbo has come in his writing and development of Harry as a character.  While not the best in the series, Nesbo still ranks among the top in his craft.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic.  Picked it up for a business trip to read in the airport and it kept me hooked throughout my business trip.  I found myself reading it as I returned to my hotel room.<br /><br />Definitely for those readers that enjoy sci-fi and post-apocalyptic stories.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|Another intelligent, artistic, original movie dealing with real themes we face in our world. People who didn't like this movie tend to be the type who cannot handle complexity, depth, ethics, or social relevance in film. This same director just released Elysium...another film that deals with issues of truth, ecology, immigration, capitalism, and brutality.
0064431789|1.0|This book is terrible. A kid with cannibalistic tendencies gets rewarded for being a little bastard? Seems to me that the message is here is its OK to be a complete sociopath.....
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Based on a great book, and with truly amazing performances from Day-Lewis and Dano, this movie is a work of art. It also tells the truth about the oil industry and is a visual feast. That's why some of the shallow sheeple who post reviews here at Amazon didn't like it. They prefer Smurfs or Despicable Me. Not something that's serious, powerful, beautiful.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The book tells the story of the complexity of secret blood lines and family history of slaves and masters, their forbidden loves and their reluctant respect for each other. It reads like a personal journal written by the young Irish girl who indentured to this Virginia family and lived among the black servants.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Blood spatter, CG blood and more blood; rivers of blood gushing, flowing everywhere.  If you like violent, mindless, idiotic action, then add 3 more stars because this is the movie you're looking for.  If you like having the bad guys getting shot in droves and falling all over themselves, then this is definitely your movie.  Otherwise, perhaps you should look elsewhere.  The first one was much better.  I'm glad I saw this via free Amazon Prime.  I shudder to think I almost paid $4 to rent this turkey at Blockbuster.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I had missed the first several seasons of this show and am grateful for the opportunity to catch up.  If this were a book it would be a page turner - since it's a show - I guess it's an episode turner!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I love me my actiony summer blockbusters. I'm not partial to superheroes over any other kind of action adventure, but I have enjoyed the cross-training efforts of the various moviemakers and comic book companies as they collaborated on the lead-up movies, so how could I not watch The Avengers to see what it was all for?<br /><br />It was for me, that's what it was for.<br /><br />As long and enjoyable as the movie was, I wish there had been more of it. There just didn't seem to be enough time for all the giant personalities to fully establish themselves. Jeremy Renner's character seemed to get shafted (ahaha) particularly hard, which was no fun, as I looked forward to much more from him. And of course there were the obligatory plot holes here and there that you're not supposed to notice because of all the showy explosions and fight scenes. Ooh! Aah! Wow! Kapow! On the other hand, I loved everyone's snarky bickering. Adorable! I totally ship Captain America and Iron Man now.<br /><br />I'll continue to watch future movies in this collection of series, because they've all been enjoyable to date and I'm invested.
140006922X|5.0|\\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" is an eye opening examination of the 'real\\" world of Jesus, pre-exodus Judaism, Roman history and politics. It is not just a study of the Gospels, which are contaminated with centuries of fictions and are greatly removed from the actual time and place and individual of Jesus.<br /><br />A lot of Christians get the book as an  attack upon Christianity, which it is not. It shows a world of myths and zealots and messiahs and brutalities and assassinations in an early Iron Age setting. It is a world ignored in mega-churches by televangelists and hucksters, whose main focus is on the factually challenged Gospels, because it would shock and dismay the faithful. From this world of murder and mayhem, however, arises Christ, which is in itself an amazing event.<br /><br />There are lots of sins of omissions that certain religious sects have condoned and encouraged over the centuries. Whatever happened to Jesus's brother James? whatever becomes of Joseph after Jesus's birth? Jesus was not born in Bethlehem but in Nazareth, so why the change in the bible. There was no census taken at the time of Jesus's birth, nor were people required to return to their place of birth for the census takers as the bible indicates. It was the Romans who enforced the census by local satraps. So why all the fiction and fabrications? Aslan does not go into that but he does explain the what was like like that might lead to these omissions.<br /><br />In his previous book he examines Islam and examines it from the point of view of history. Many of the attacks against this book are often because Aslan is Islamic, not understanding or caring that Jesus is a prophet in that religion maybe not a messiah of which there were many roaming about Judea at the time, as well as in the Palestinian region as a whole.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is a refreshing delight to watch. Addicting I might add.To remember the respect and honor we once had toward each other is often forgot and sparingly given in this day and age. The stories and characters are perfectly written and filled.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Saw it first in the theater.  Enjoyed watching it again.  Would recommend it to a friend.  The ending kind of sucked.  Don't want to put in a spoiler.  But I am not partial to that kind of ending.
B008VBYN80|5.0|neat little time waster give it a shot its free easy and friendly good for all ages yep yep so come on down
1454704225|5.0|Lots of great ideas that seem easy to follow and complete.  I wanted something I could do quickly.. no long term projects.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Even if you couldn't hear the dialogue or follow the story line the visual impact of this series would make it worth watching. Amazing opening sequence. Thrown in the story line and dialogue this one has to top the charts.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Being an avid reader, I was looking for a great fiction. Ender's game is that fiction! It's catchy the plot is great, and it keeps you wanting to read more and more and more. The price wasn't too bad either. Get Ender's game, you won't regret it!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is one of my favorite app, I can use it as a diary or just to write down my duties it is good, have different options. I really recommend it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Didn't think I would like it but wanted to see what the hype was about.  I am a true follower now.  I'm mad that I have no others to watch and can't wait for the new season.
B00006AG5N|5.0|it was just what I wanted at a price I could afford and it fit fine. I can't wait to wear it to our next Bridgte luncheon where we drink as much wine as we play bridge.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Excellent, although a little on the depressing side with the characters lost.  Can't wait til season four.  Just wish there wasn't so much time between seasons.
B0030MKGKY|5.0|This was my favorite movie in 2010 and is among my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I was thrilled it won Best Director and Best Picture. Totally deserving. This is a story about how different people behave in extreme conditions. There is no politicizing and no message. It's a movie about these guys who do a dangerous job every day. Jeremy Renner is amazing. You can't take your eyes off of him. If you have trouble with violence and gore, either don't watch this at all or watch it with someone who has seen it who can tell you when to look away. It's not at all gratuitously violent or gory -- which makes it even more intense when it happens because it's tied to the story and even more gut wrenching.
0446547638|5.0|I loved this book! Read it in 2 days and had trouble putting it down. I feel this is one of Nicholas Spark's best written books...right up there with &#34;the Notebook&#34;.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|'Nuff said...however, Amazon feels I have to add additional words to this review THEY wanted ME to make, so let me just add, &#34;Good.  Bad.  I'm the guy with the gun.&#34;<br /><br />Seriously, watch this movie if you haven't already, if you're a fan of horror comedies, or Bruce Campbell in general.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Tom Cruise acted convincingly along with this minimal cast of characters. Each scene logically led to the next, and finally the conclusion with superb filming and convincing CG. On the edge-of-your-seat action. I had to stick with the movie without a break. There were no slow times for me. The cast of main characters, including one who only appeared on a monitor screen, fit their parts in the story.<br /><br />This genre usually doesn't keep me watching. This, of course, was the lone exception.
1400052181|5.0|this item was okay because it helped my son out for school even though he didnt need the book until january but i am so glad he got it because it helped him out during the summer days so good job with this one
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|This movie is awesome, remember in the nineties when kid's shows were trying to be progressive and yet still were funny and light-hearted, this is that. Sure the grandma says \\"jackass\\" and the jock turns out to be gay, but that's the thing, it's so much closer to real life than whitewashed robot crap that most writers are vomiting onto children's television these days. Real grandmas swear, some gays have dynamic personalities that don't revolve around there sexuality, some chubby eleven year old ginger kids understand the reality of social exclusion and marginalization. I loved it and would recommend it highly to anyone, including children (past the age of mimicking due to the singular instance of a swear).
B006LSZECO|5.0|You think you know what's going on and then you don't.  I cared about the characters, I didn't like them, but I still cared.
B001FB55I0|1.0|I would give this 2-3 stars but so many give it 4-5 makes it kind of pointless. Its amazing to me how people rate more recent movies so high when they're not even in the same ballpark as some of the originals.  The Terminator Salvation and Total Recall are two good examples of this. Just add more booms to the movie and today's movie-goer seems to eat it up.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Now, i have world history at my fingertips. Will generations to come realize how history repeats itself. All throughout history, we have people who decide they know what is good for everyone else.  Truly, freedom is the ultimate gift to humanity.  You work hard, you are rewarded.  If you live off those who work hard, you lose.<br /><br />Manipulating the public, never, ever goes away.  With social media, it becomes easier.  With the degradation of education, it makes indoctrination so very easy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm definitely a beginner. I stayed on level one for a month. This is a challenging workout. I noticed a difference quickly. My weight had stop moving since i switched to this workout it started moving again. I don't use a mat I have carpet. I had started with 1 lb weights since I was so out of shape, it was a waste. I use 3lb weights which are still rather light.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Simple yet so addicting! Highly recommended. Fun if you like guns! Most world war 2 guns are featured in this game!
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Great mic for the price.  Sturdy and sounds great, sounds pretty close to a shure SM58 at a fraction of the cost.  The travel case it comes with is awesome too
B004U8VWLE|3.0|This was one of those films that I'd heard was going to be soooooooo good. I thought Natalie Portman did a good job, and I'm not a fan of her acting, but she can do over-the-top neurotic, crazy person pretty well. I have a feeling it's innate to her if she lets herself actually have emotions. Otherwise, I was disappointed. The story was kind of dull except for the end which didn't seem like enough to make it worth watching. Probably, if I hadn't heard anything about how great it was beforehand, I would have had low expectations (because of Portman) and actually liked it.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|bought it &#34;used as new&#34; came like brand new, could see my reflection perfectly on the other side of the disc. well worth the money spent
B003TVMIYS|5.0|Great client stories and enjoyed seeing the Doc work while struggling with his own stuff.  This represents one type of psychotherapy. It's not Dr. Phil (who does not do actual psychotherapy).
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Really liked this series fun quick read. Looking forwarded to reading the other books in the series they all look good.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I just can't wait for the next installment.  Amazing book by Sylvia Day. I just love the Crossfire Series.  It's a page turner.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|Does not work on samsung galaxy prevail phone. Improve phone compatibility and i promise i will rrvise the one star rating.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game needs an update it says there is one already but the app store doesn't let you get it because it's a glitch
B008JFUNWS|5.0|This movie is awesome. I have been waiting for this one for a long time. I loved the first movie and i'm glad they finally made the second one. I don't know why they waited so long. I have never read the books but now I want to. I thought that they did a good job. and i'm glad they kept the original cast. this is a great movie can't wait until they make 3. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all times! Great for the whole family.  I recommend it to all of my friends.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|This has to be the best scary/possession movie I've seen in a long time. most scary movies are disappointing know a days but this one kicked the bucket I would probably put this in my top ten best horror movies I've seen. horror movies usually don't make me jump but this one did a couple times. if a scary movie can do that than its good. it even made me tear up a little during the end because it was so tense and horrifying and this is coming from someone who does not get scared and is in his thirties. when you watch it you'll know what I mean. the acting in this movie was excellent. the three things that made this movie scary was the house, acting and music. if you want to get scared see this movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can hardly put this game down.  Solitaire is one of my favorite games of all time and this one is fun and challenging.  My grand-daughter loves it too!!!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|This CD Is All I Expected. Love The Music As Much As The Movie. I Would Recommend It Totally. Thank you.
B00659N39K|5.0|This is a very expensive lunch box!  But the packaging, the materials, and the quality are outstanding.  It is very compact and looks great!  It will allow you to pack healthy lunches for your kids, not just sandwiches :)<br /><br />It arrived in 2 days, as expected and my daughter absolutely loves it!  It appears to be better than plastic low-quality, cheap lunch boxes sold elsewhere, but time will show whether it is durable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have never been into zombie movies ever before but started watching this series on a whim and got hooked immediately.<br /><br />It's a very addicting drama indeed.  I could do without some of the graphic violence of this show though.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Of the 3 books in the series, this is the most grown up of all and, as a grown up myself, I was able to appreciate it in all its complexities. I strongly identify with Katniss and commend the author for creating such a believable character. Katniss is the unwilling hero that no matter how hard she tries to keep to herself, seems to always be dragged into roles that don't fit her, manipulated and used by others for their gains. She alternatively resents it, rebels to it, grudgingly submit to it, but always in a resentful, morose way. She thinks her distrust of others will shield her from the next scheme and manipulation, but others always seem to find ways around her defenses, and she's left wondering \\"how did I get here again?\\" I thought this was portrayed masterfully in this book.<br />Another more adult theme is the hunger for power innate in all human endeavours. The Capital exerts a cruel dictatorship on the districts, but District 13, which fights it, is in itself an Orwellian society. And the leaders of the rebellion are as ruthless and as cruel as President Snow. This may be hard for younger and more idealistic readers to swallow, but it certainly states what history has repeated ad nauseam about human nature.<br />One thing I didn't particularly like was the Capital being set up like some videogame set, with rather absurd booby traps that made very little sense.
140006922X|4.0|This is a solid academic read of first century Palestine but I'm not convinced it adds anything substantive to the work John Crossan has done on the same period.  The overarching context is good and the historical analysis is well cited and readable.
B003O86FMW|4.0|While the 1st book in the series is more obviously YA fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by the depths of more mature themes this second book touched. Other reviewers complain Katniss is too passive in this book, but frankly if they read the 1st book with more attention, they'd realize Katniss is the ultimate unwilling hero. Also she may be a good hunter and a good survivor but she is not the sharpest and most devious of minds. Also the only person she really cares for is her sister. People who have experienced hardship sometimes feel they are already overwhelmed by their own problems and will leave others to deal with their own. Some will even come to the point of despising those who can't fend for themselves in a \\"I did it, why can't you?\\" attitude I can certainly recognize. These traits are not, in my opinion, flaws necessarily, and make her more interesting and complex.<br />One thing I didn't like much was another round of Hunger Games. Here the author made the same mistake of so many other sequels, of taking a good idea and thinking that making it bigger, more complicated and more belabored will make it better. For me it didn't. The first arena was believable (I have gone camping enough times to easily picture it in my mind), but the second is just over the top and overdone.<br />If you read this book with some rabid fan attitude, where any departure from what you think the series should be is seen as sacrilege, then you may not like it. If you read it for pure entertainment, I think this is a very good sequel.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Story line was incomplete.  I wanted to know more.  It had potential but continually skimmed the surface of what could have been an intriguing fantasy.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Great game for both veteran planeswalkers and those who are new to casting spells. The tutorials help teach the new players and a good refresher for the he people who have played for awhile. Campaign is fun. And has a good storyline. Sealed play is good for deck building skills. Four stars. Would be five if there was sealed play<br /> multiplayer.
B0084670FU|1.0|terrible movie, 1st 5 minutes showing a 10 year old boy as a peeping tom on his female cousin to masterbating on screen. after the  1st 5 minutes, we shut off the movie
B00C3NCDWU|5.0|I love this book and this edition was in excellent condition and described perfectly by the seller. It is a beautiful addition to my library.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Fantastic re-make of the original 2 updated with all the current tech capabilities. If only they'd do the same for Army of Darkness...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show , quiet addicting .. Like all the suits of Harvey Specter ... All people are dressed perfectly and act very effortlessly .
B00571F26Y|4.0|At first the book sounded like a script from an info-commercial, the author repeats himself, but I came to realize now he was trying to drive home a point. I'm moving toward following the suggested diet.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|The first time I watched it was agonizing for the most part. The second time, in order to break the script down, I actually turned the volume down during all the stressful parts-lol. This would never be called a favorite film--even taking out all  the arguing. There were moments that were enjoyable--namely, her vulnerability and his effort on her behalf.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|First of all, I'm a bit annoyed that it's over $9 on Nook and $5 on Kindle. I have a nook. I shouldn't be punished for not being on the Kindle wagon. :/ This lovely fact didn't have anything to do with my review, but it does help solidify my decision to not pick up another one of this authors books.<br /><br />I think if I'd read this book before ANY other YA novel, I'd have liked it. However, after reading this book, I've decided that I never want to read another YA book again. It wasn't that this was a bad book, just very predictable and followed the same formula that every other YA novel published in recent years follows.<br />Bones was a quick read with good character development, the story flowed in a consistent, timely manor and the \\"twist\\" at the end was well done, even if I saw it WAY earlier. I personally won't be picking up any other books in this series, but if you enjoy YA, Supernaturals and a well-written story, you should pick up this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like Solitaire. And don't mind a few adds. This is the app for you. Easy options. Great graphics.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This game is so addicting, I will not give up til the chocolates are all gone! I hate the those pesky chocolates. Lol
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app!! Tottaly worth the money$.Only thing is that the you get the update WAY later than it comes out. My friend has it on her ipod and I didn't get the update till a week or two later.Needs to be fixed. That's only on the Kindle Fire.Other than that you should totally get this app.BEST GAME IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!!
B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|I enjoyed playing this game however, at higher levels (24 and beyond) the random arrangement in Infinite mode will often cause an instant loss because the blocks stacked right to the top withount any action being taken.  I have made it to level 36 but once I lost that level I had to restart the game at level 30.<br />Recommendations:<br />1) add logic so that blocks cannot stack all of the way to the top at the beginning level<br />2) allow for selection and restart at levels higher than 30
B00A8LRIEW|5.0|Ok, the 8 songs here are not really new. They are not used tracks from previous album \\"Waiting for the sirens to call\\". But in truth these new old tracks are wonderfull! Better than previous album! the songs are very consistent and I don't believe they are left over. It reminds me Republic times. Thank you NO!
B00DI75SWM|4.0|I love this game,but the only problem is that it will only show if you search it. Like I said before, this is a fun game.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|again, more of the same, we like this series and cant wait for more suits<br />these people are ruthless and great characters
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. I love saving my money to buy the next big thing. There's always something else that I want to get to upgrade my park. And you have 3 parks to work with so it never gets old. I recommend this to all ages. My son and I both love it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Like this series a lot......<br />we watched the whole season in about two weeks and many episodes back to back
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does exactly what it advertises for $35.<br /><br />I wanted a way to easily stream YouTube videos to my entertainment system and Chromecast does that.  When friends come over they always want to show some song or video to everyone and hooking up a laptop with an ugly hdmi cable to the TV was out of the question.  A media center PC was an option, but costs a decent amount of money.  I have a roku for netflix (only way to watch netflix) so I don't need it for that.<br /><br />First night I set it up I had 3 friends come over.  At first everyone was using my tablet to show a new song or a funny video, but soon enough they were all casting it from their own android phones (they had access to my wifi).  Worked perfectly and was easy for everyone to figure out.<br /><br />The only thing I had trouble with was that to cast a stream from Chrome on the PC, you need to install the Chromecast extension.  That was not mentioned in any of the instrunctions.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love this series! If u haven't seen then yet- start with season one and you'll be hooked! :). Not much else to say
B00CXQL828|5.0|i'm a big mike portnoy (drummer extraordinaire: dream theater+++) fan, but add billy sheehan (bass player extraordinaire: mr big+++) and richie kotzen (screamin' guitarist and rockin' lead vocals:poison+++); wow! this is one rockin' band in the classic hard rock vain. tracks are influenced by classic rock, with hints of prog rock and just a touch of radio friendliness. you'll find great music prowess in all tracks. they make it sound easy and a whole lotta fun recording this one. some of these tunes get in your head and those that did got me playing the cd over and over again. don't cherry pick tracks for download. grab the whole cd! here's hoping this band kicks out at least a couple more compilations like this one. can't wait to hear this live. rock!
1582701709|4.0|I just wish that the theory was easier to apply to real life. It is a good read and I can see the truth in many of the quotes. Worth a read.
B005AKA91A|5.0|This is a great movie, the panoramic last scene of the Pickett, Pettigrew, Trimble charge gives the audience some realism of what actually occurred
0345528581|4.0|We bought this for my brother-n-law as a gift. He said its been very helpful and he likes the book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love the game just needs more time finding the objects.other than that the game is fun if you like hidden object games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The antagonizing pleasure of suspense kept me constantly reading. The ending left me sad but I LOVED IT!!! Simply amazing
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|A little slow taking off, as is any story when it needs to build its character's, and more than a couple shockers and tight situation.
0143122916|5.0|This is one of the most amazing life journeys I have ever read. I can't tell you how many times during the reading of this book that I just had to pause and feel grateful. So many of us in the free world take our lives for granted and I really believe that everyone who is so disappointed in our own government should read this book (not that our government couldn't be improved--lol--it certainly can and by all sides!).<br /><br />It's such a fascinating story that I found it hard to put down. Much of it was difficult to read. It's well written; I could visualize the camp, the punishments, the small joys, and the hopelessness.<br /><br />His escape was so exciting it read to me like a novel. I was rooting for him every step of the way.  He must be very intelligent to pull off wandering around China for that long without being sent back to NK.<br /><br />I would really love to meet Shin one day--just to tell him how much I admire his spirit and courage. He's a remarkable man. It troubles me that he still feel shame for things. I cannot judge him at all. His life--his treatment--was so full of horrors, it is amazing that he survived it at all. This is a man I deeply admire.  Every American should read his story.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Each time i open it it says i need to go to the app store to update, but each time i go i cant update, it only says open and when i open it it still says i need to update it
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I Have all his books. Would read this again. Right up there with the notebook and message in a bottle.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I'm here to show naughty review and I now there is<br />Six sharks and do you know the last what the gonorrhea shark in the world<br />The megalodon it can eat mines jellyfish and small fishing boats<br />Everything there are hard missions<br />Not naughty a river<br />I've unlocked all the sharks without cheating or buying coins or gems
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|There are only 40 levels. It is a fun and interesting game. I wish there were more levels though, because once you're done you're done. I would give it 5 stars if there were more levels!
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|I'm glad Shane is on Blu-ray and I applaud WB for releasing this great Western on Blu-ray. The quality of the BD is stunning  with excellent picture quality. The picture is very sharp and clear which brings out the great color with not much static being seen through the film. The audio sounds great and provides French and Spanish audio too. The subtitles included are English, French and Spanish. The special features included are: commentary with George Steven Jr. and associate producer Ivan Moffat with the original trailer. The film included is in color, runtime of 118mins and is in it's original aspect ratio 1.37:1 format. The cast in the film are; Alan Ladd, Jean Arthur, Van Heflin, Brandon De Wilde, Jack Palance, Ben Johnson, Edgar Buchanan, Elisha Cook Jr., Ellen Corby and is Directed by George Stevens. Overall this is an excellent Blu-ray and I would recommend it, especially to Western fans.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Love the game however it takes 2 tokens when you rematch and the players do not accept. There are no other ways to win tokens besides uno or scratch unless you buy. Completely disappointed
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is fun to play and it has a great variety of games for all types of people. It is especially nice for long road trips.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|This movie touches on the lives of two broken people who find somethings worthwhile and recognizable in each other and eventually connect.  I feel these play-books really happen with all of us in some form or another, it's just not enjoyable entertainment. There is lots of uncomfortably loud arguing, some violence and mostly harsh, tense, and edgy, throughout the movie.  It takes the right frame of mind to watch this flick.
B008M721MS|1.0|It installs and then cannot connect due to a network error... just one more busted app for my Kindle. How can Skype release trash like this???
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Keeps saying to update but i cant when i get to app store. Cannot play anymore, very frustrating. Any ideas?
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|About 30 minutes into this movie I realized that my jaw was clenched and that every muscle in my body was tense.<br /><br />Very intense, emotional, and fascinating.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Love this game but I got to good high score but know it wont let me play know it makes me so mad because I was doing so good now I can't play for some reason my email is<br />Brandiluv29@gmail.com
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|If you're into rock music, then you will like this movie. It also inspired me to go buy some of the songs from the soundtrack.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is simply amazing. I did every experiment in a true sense and man it really works. Thanks a million Pam!!!!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|The premise for this story  is different yet no less believable. I loved the narrator's voice and could easily empathisize with the characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game has amazing graphics and fun minnios they are very adorable cute and sweet except when yoi have tpo face elmacho in his lair
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie was absolutely fantastic. The effects and action sequences were breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat for the entire film. Prior to seeing the movie, I was worried that it would consist of nothing but action and a weak plot. My fear was completely unnecessary. The plot is extremely compelling and keeps the audiences riveted. We all know the basics of the story of Superman - but the director does an excellent job of making him somehow more real than we could have hoped for, and has us sympathizing with Clark on a deeply personal level. There is a certain artistic flavor to the way the movie was filmed that makes it edgier and even more satisfying, giving us a cinematic experience that is very difficult to forget. In fact, I found myself back at the theater to see it again in 3D (which made the effects all the more outstanding), and then one more time in 2D once my theater stopped showing it in 3D. As a broke college student who is forced to spend her meager finances very carefully, the fact that I couldn't resist spending almost forty dollars on watching this movie should give you an idea of how absolutely worth it this movie is.
0767919408|4.0|Typical Bryson. You won't be disappointed. I was just reading [[ASIN:1594204365 Year Zero: A History of 1945]] and thinking how great it would be to see similar works for different years. Here we have one season of one year in one country. You might think this couldn't possibly be interesting, especially to a wide audience, but you'd be wrong. What Bryson does here, even if this wasn't one of his main goals, is to show how much history there really is out there, and how much things tie together. Definitely recommended.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|One of the ten best holiday movies, it centers on love and interesting characters in very different love stories. I with they kept the naked sex scene out so it is watchable by younger ages. It's a good one and sophisticated.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I guess my expectations were high. The Kite Runner was my all-time favorite book. His other book whose title escapes me was good but not as great as KR but this one didn't hold my attention. Didn't finish it.
B00AVIQPJQ|5.0|This is a great movie filled with action, humor, and a real tear jerker as well. Like my title says it is one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|In terms of graphics, this is the best game I have seen for the HD. The game play is fast and some may have an issue with the In App Purchases, but you can still enjoy it without paying anything. The game is challenging enough to keep your attention without being too difficult.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I just finished this book, and I can't wait to return to Chapter 1 to re-read any parts that I missed. I could not put this book down and the characters stay with you long after the author has moved on.  Overall, it's a beautifully written, achingly good story that leaves you wanting more. You will not be disappointed!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Relaxing choice of sounds to block out other noises and lull you to sleep.  Nice that you can layer sounds as well to create the perfect relaxation combination for yourself.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is a great game for all ages alike. Kind of hard to describe it; so just try it now.
B005544V6A|4.0|Engaging story line and exciting to watch. If you like the show Blue Collar you'll like this show since they have a similar story line.
B006YC74E8|5.0|This so makes my pictures beautiful! I think it is better then some of the ones you have to pay for. Totally worth getting!
B00BLLXGS0|5.0|I have their last cd and wasn't disappointed when I got this one.  I have seen these guys live and live their sound!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was at level 52 or so when it updated and now not only did I waste all that time and money but more I can't get in at all due to saying it needs an update but won't work. This is a scam to me you took my money and now everything I worked for is gone. I'm done.
B0047DVHV2|4.0|A good read if you lived the 60's and 70's.  A good insight into Keith Richards which shows more of the gentle side to him. Not what you would expect him to be like
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a great app for those who enjoy editing photos. I would not say this is the best one ever, but it is definitely up there. There are so many useful features that come with this app. I was very fortunate to get this app when it was free app of the day, but it is worth the money.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|husband and kids read the book so I bought it for him.  It was okay, not my type of movie but my husband enjoyed it.
0385349947|4.0|This book is intended for the educated professional female ages 26-54, others may find it hard to relate to. Good read!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I bought this for a gift, never saw it but heard its great!  I hope the recipient feels the same about it.
1476733953|5.0|I love post-apocalyptic books, I do. I've read a lot of them. I love science fiction, and I've read a lot of it.<br /><br />But even if you don't fall into either of those categories, you should read Wool, because the post-apocalyptic, science-fiction aspects of it are the least important.<br /><br />What's incredible, instead, is the relationship between people, between power and lack of it, between right, and customary. About conflict, and revolution.<br /><br />Those are important things, fascinating things, and things that you should read about, and that you will enjoy reading about. The hero's journey in this book is something that you can feel viscerally, feel that you are a part of.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?
B005R32L66|5.0|Great device for keeping in contact with friends and family I live on the west coast and most of my family is on  the east coast.
0756407915|5.0|This book came a lot sooner than I expected it to come, considering I ordered it just before the 4th of July. It was in mint condition, wrapped in a waterproof envelope for extra protection. Also, I am currently in love with this book (as well as the first book in this series). Buy it.
B004IK30S2|4.0|Good movie. Great quality. Great price.<br />I got this in prep for the sequel coming out.<br />You can not put a price on laughter.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Excellent collection of selections from several notable singers and musicians. Most are singers from some years or decades ago. Worthwhile purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game os the bomb its tum for the kiddies and for yourself if you need a little relaxation time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting character development. Liked the he said, she said style of the book. This is my first Gillian Flynn novel, but I look forward to others!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Its better then jelewls and candy sage  me and my husband  played it together  while in bed so much fun so much fun love this game. Good game to play with your partner before bed
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book allows for an active.discussion.  It also might cause you to reflect on those parts of your life that you shut out rather than dealing with the issues.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I actually saw this film before, but rented it again.  McConaughey is one of my fav actors and portrays the character perfectly. The ending is an unexpected surprise and it's always inspiring to see good win over evil.
B0029ZA49Q|3.0|I think that the harness should be able to adjust so that it's a little bit shorter - I shortened the straps all the way, and they were still a little too long.  I would have liked them shorter to raise the Toploader a little higher on my chest.  I'm thinking about modifying the straps to make them shorter.  So these are OK when paired with the Toploader bag, but not perfect.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved it! Percy Jackson is tied with harry potter for my favorite fantasy book series! Good for everyone from experienced first graders to middle aged parents!
B008YW5RH2|5.0|nice game, and I really love to play this game. Please made more versions and add more players and add davis cup also.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Hurry up Erin and write some more! And thank you for such a lovely book. I wish I could turn around and go back into the Circus....
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I couldn't believe how slow and boring this book was. 80% of the book is her just moping around doing nothing. Highly disappointed with books 2 and 3 of this series.
0811879631|4.0|I was very pleased with the product. I bought a used one in &#34;good&#34; condition and I swear its almost perfect. It has one little dented corner but its perfect. I recommend this book to anyone who loves pixar. It makes a great gift. Seeing the art of some of your favorite Pixar movie, where it all started, is such a joy.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My 4 year old and my 2 year old both love this movie.  Very appropriate for children and has a great message.  The music is very catchy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just as fabulous as on the web! If you are addicted to this site, then this app is just as good!
B004WZGV6Q|4.0|I purchased this book many years ago and recommended it then and still do. I've read the reviews and maybe its not for them. All of the information won't apply to all men and women (if you look closely, you might see yourself;lol). A good example (from the book)is women are nurturers. We think we are showing love to our man when we tell him what to wear, how to wear it etc. Men, not all men, take this as babying them or controlling them (you get the picture). For some men, its a turn-off; others might like it. You have to get to know the man you are with. Another example, telling a man how to do something, when to do something, if its not done when you think it should be done, you do it yourself. Sounds familiar? What about this, you're husband is driving the car ( with you in it) and you are constantly giving him directions; instead of allowing him to figure it out for himself. There are other examples, solutions , interpretations of what's being said, done etc.(too much to write). PURCHASE THE BOOK!!!<br />The 5 Love Languages is an excellent book as well. I highly recommend both books for couples. :-)
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Seriously, I would have rated this 5 stars if it weren't for all the glitches in the game. It's very similar to the farming games on fb with the animals, machinery and the like except for a lot more variety in the animals, machines, trees, crops, and the like. My favorite is that you can actually (and quite easily) build a kitchen to cook and sell recipes AND a warehouse to store things while you're not using them. Okay, now here comes the problem: when you get neighbors -- also easy, there is. a forum -- when you visit them to fertilize their crops the game kicks you out. I've been told by them to make sure nothing is running at the same time. Didn't work. I even removed as many apps from my fire as I possibly could to see if that would help. Didn't work. Hey guys, awesome game, really. Make it like me and that would be worth another star or two.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|I've loved Queen for years, but just recently bought this collection. Was not disappointed. You need this album! I need extra words to publish this review! Radio gaga, radio googoo, radio gaga!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is the best game ever to have at a doctor's appointment. Passenger in a car is a good one too. You'll never know where the time went. Fantastic exercise for your brain too, and great for your hand/eye coordination. If you're concerned about strain on your eyesight, don't be; you can enlarge the screen if you like. Best of all, you can pause the game and it will stay paused, no matter how long it takes you to return. Excellent game, I definitely recommend.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I thought this movie was really good. Some of the ways the characters story lines connected were a bit of a stretch. I mean it's mentioned once at the end of the movie that two of the characters are related. I was surprised how many negative reviews there were and from people who stopped watching after 20 or 30 minutes. Apparently, some people think that comedies can't have any serious or sad moments. I disagree. It is a funny movie with some serious moments and some serious heart. The style is reminiscent of 'He's Just Not that Into You' in that there are multiple story lines that are occurring simultaneously. The ending isn't surprising; in that way, it's a pretty typical rom com with a happy ending. But that didn't detract from how good the movie was or how funny it was. Some parts were pretty cheesy, but all in all, it was really good.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is such a great tv show! Smart writing, great casting and wonderful actors make this one of my favorite shows.
B009G41CG2|4.0|Mahjong is one of my favorite games and I love this version of it.  It offers tons of different layouts to challenge myself with.
B000L53D4O|4.0|The grandkids love it so I'm calling it a win especially since I snagged it during the 50% off sale. Would I pay full price for it? No -- I think at full price it's overpriced for what it is and how it's made. But it is durable and it does get played with and helps the little ones walk so we're all happy with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son is obsessed with this game.  He plays it everyday. He would play it all day everyday if I would let him.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is a great game to play when you have a few minutes to kill.  The puzzles take a few minutes to complete.  They are hard enough to be slightly challenging but not super hard where it takes forever to figure out.  The only bad thing is that if you exit it then you lose any progress you made on that level.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Much like Lone Survivor, this book shows us what a very select few sacrifice for the rest of us to ensure our freedom.
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I do like this kind of game but sometimes clues are hard to see because lighting and size for these old eyes so best played on the computer rather than phone.  Also in-game hints like in the room would nice.  Graphics were good.
B000P407K4|5.0|Now for a lot of you young people, I am sure you're thinking \\"Laaame! It's all old and in Black & White\\". I will admit that this is what I thought at first as well. I fully planned to stop watching it before the end, and tell my friend how much this movie sucked.<br /><br />Fortunately, the movie turned out to be HILARIOUS! The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and it's all hilarious. Furthermore 1 guy plays 3 VASTLY different characters, I dare you to figure out which 3 were played by the same person! This is one of those old movies that are timeless, that time has not made less awesome. You will find this in another Black & White classic like Addams Family!<br /><br />If you love funny movies, quirky and/or crazy characters, then this movie is for you!!

I am very upset!!!  Otherwise I would have given it as 4 star rating because of having to spend actual money to get past certain goals.  Very distressing.  :(
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you are a musician, or audiophile,  especially for you,  this film will be a delight to see. If you are curious about the record making side of music you will love this film as well!  I had never heard of Sound City until this video and I had no idea that it had recorded such great artists over several decades.  Musicians from all over the world were attracted to this studio.  Check it out and see why!  It's just was of those films that you can easily develop an emotional  attraction to.  It kinda makes you sad at the end when the &#34;Sound City&#34; era ends.

B00003CXIY|4.0|\\"Road Trip\\" (2000) is a school comedy and road trip movie about a likable college guy who wants to stay faithful to his long-time girlfriend. Unfortunately he gives-in to temptation and accidentally sends her a video of him making out with another girl. He and a group of friends rush from Ithaca, NY, to Austin, TX, to recover the evidence before his girlfriend receives it.<br /><br />I initially saw \\"Road Trip\\" on TV while on vacation a few years ago and liked it enough to purchase the film recently. Viewing the uncut version, I was turned off by the crude humor (in the manner of, say, \\"American Pie\\"), but have to admit that I busted out laughing numerous times, plus the characters are really fleshed out, like the protagonist (Breckin Meyer) who really does want to stay true to his long-distant girlfriend; the \\"I'm only in college for sex\\" dude who you can't help but like for some reason (Seann William Scott); the geek whom the 'cool' dudes befriend for selfish purposes (DJ Qualls) and more.<br /><br />Amy Smart also co-stars as the protagonist's new girlfriend.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: The only thing that prevents \\"Road Trip\\" from achieving A-grade status like, say, \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" is the unnecessary crude parts. If you can look past this flaw, it's consistently funny and has great characters. The women aren't all that great, although Amy Smart is solid.<br /><br />The film runs 95 minutes and was shot mostly in Georgia & Tennessee, but also includes an aerial shot of Harvard (Massachusetts), as well as footage from USC and the University of Texas in Austin.<br /><br />GRADE: B

B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|According to Damian Stevenson's bio, he's seen SCARFACE 200 times. That's probably more than most people, but if you know a man between the ages of 20 and 40, chances are he's seen SCARFACE at least once (probably more) and that at least once (probably more) he's done a really bad imitation of one of the movie's signature lines, \\"Say hello to my leetle freend.\\"<br />This book is billed as the \\"ultimate guide\\" to the 1983 remake of the 1932 Howard Hawks movie and it lives up to its boast. Stevenson begins with the statement that \\"SCARFACE is a powerful and stylized commentary on violence, materialism, excess, corruption and crime in America.\\" Comparing the movie's anti-hero Tony Montana to Macbeth (persuasively), Stevenson offers up a book full of analysis, information, and just plain gossip that covers pretty much any aspect of the movie's making, right down to the way the poster's iconic image was crafted.<br />Film buffs will appreciate the behind-the-scenes aspect of the story as Stevenson chronicles the script's development, and the obstacles in its path. Readers whose only connection to Hollywood is a bookmark for TMZ on their browser will enjoy the tidbits like who was originally considered for the role of Elvira, the icy blonde goddess played by Michelle Pfeiffer.  (Brooke Shields was a contender and so was Glenn Close.)<br />Stevenson's style is low-key but every once in a while he throws in a zinger just to see if his readers are paying attention, as when he talks about Oliver Stone heading to Paris after being hired to re-write the screenplay and \\"putting his firsthand knowledge of cocaine to practical use.\\"<br />Stone's script became infamous for the number of times that it dropped the f-bomb (a little more than 200 times, which was impressive in 1983, but doesn't even put SCARFACE in the top five most-profane movies these days).  One of the best quotes in the book, which features interviews with many of the actors as well as director Brian De Palma, is a line thrown out by Joan Collins.<br />There are many reasons why the movie SCARFACE became a cultural touchstone. This engaging and entertaining book examines those reasons.line thrown out by Joan Collins.<br />There are many reasons why the movie SCARFACE became a cultural touchstone.

B009WUBERW|2.0|The first one wasn't Citizen Kane by any stretch of the imagination but at least it was somewhat enjoyable. This one is is poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed. Cameos for cameo sake, Gun battles for gun battle sake and exploding blood packs too numerous to count. Thanks goodness it was free with Prime otherwise I would have upset with the waste of money.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie seemed a little slow at the start and then it got going. All of the characters were good and even if you didn't know them all you could still enjoy the inner action between them. Action-packed and lots of fun. Our 10 year old grandson enjoyed the movie.

B008JFUO4U|5.0|If you're into New World Order stuff, freemasonry and numerology, you can get very interesting messages through this movie. If you are also someone that understands how our 'matrix' system works, how Birth Certificates define the way our society is structured, you will also understand why the creators of this movie have chosen the clone theme.<br /><br />Some messages and 'wink winks' you might or might not have seen in the movie:<br /><br />1) His number is 49. 4 + 9 = 13  --  13 is a sacred masonic number<br /><br />2) Mission communications screen has always the number 33  -- another masonic number<br /><br />3) Drone 166 is the one who survives all the way to the end of the movie. 1 + 6 + 6 = 13 -- you get the idea.<br /><br />4) Mission space base shaped as a pyramid capstone, but it's upside down.<br /><br />5) Mission \\"brains\\" inside massive ship has an \\"all seeing eye\\" that is red.<br /><br />6) Julia tells Jack \\"You don't know who you are\\" -- (If you understand the Birth Certificate scam, you know what this means)<br /><br />7) Victoria, when confronted with reality, shouts \\"I don't want to know!!!\\" -- Is Victoria a reference to the population in general?<br /><br />8) Mission says \\"I created you Jack, I am your God\\" -- You can take this message anyway you want.<br /><br />9) Jack Harper at the end is number 52. 5 + 2 = 7 -- A sacred number in the Christian Bible.<br /><br />There is more, but I won't spoil. If you watch the \\"making of\\" section, you'll also notice Freemason hand shakes when they meet in the music studio.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent movie, I'm glad some producers out there have done their homework when it comes to explaining (for those who want to hear about it) how this world really works.

1597801585|4.0|The book really kept my interest, although it did take a while to get used to both his style and the technical terms.  The author really does create a unique world, adding to it an entire expansive history and deeply inventive scifi tech.  I would consider it one of the best scifi novels to come out so far this decade.  It keeps with the new trend of dark, weird science fiction, yet keeps the technology just within our fathomable reach.<br /><br />But don't be fooled!  This book is not as difficult to read as James Joyce, nor is it written with the technical precision of Hawthorn, yet I must state that it will take work to get through.  Anyone looking for an easy, lazy weekend read, this probably isn't it.  Anyone looking for a scifi novel that is very different from most of the novels published, give this a try.
B008J05EL8|2.0|Very difficult to use, trying to create and use the available package was extremely frustrating.  I still have not figured out how to use Excel or Word. That is, creating a doc editing it so I can send back to my computer.  As I am very pro these programs and use slot as I have a severe memory loss condition is extremely frustrating.  Changing the font in e-mails is also very difficult to find out how to do.
0307593312|1.0|I am starting to believe that Murakami's newest works are being read simply because Murakami wrote them.  Yes, it's his classic style. Once again he is bringing you into a world that is filled with as much fantasy as hard reality.  The characters drive the story rather than any true plot.  None of these things, in and of themselves are reasons not to read this book.  It's what happens when they clash together that make those reasons: they create a stagnate story.  Nothing happens.  For hundreds of pages nothing happens.  Slowly, as you learn more about the individual characters, the story appears to expand, and suddenly you realize it took a very long time to go nowhere at all.<br /><br />True, prose never has to drive a specific plot or character forward to be a great read.  Themes, setting and overall vibes can accomplish that.  This, however, was just one more Murakami story that wasn't moving.  Each character has a strange back story or quirk that he drives home.  Over and over and over again.  Reality and fantasy mesh in unfathomable ways, you're never really meant to understand.  Every Murakami book and every odd quirk he has ever written appears here at some point.  This is the same old devices played over again: within the novel itself and within the Murakami bibliography.<br /><br />Classic Murakami, only too much so and in a very large quantity. The book falls flat and unfortunately it is not fresh ground in which it lands.

B006XF5BTG|2.0|Good basic information about nutrition and gaining strength but that's all it is really--basic. The rep range (4-6) that he swears by is definitely more geared toward strength than muscle growth (hypertrophy).  However, gaining strength is absolutely critical for muscle mass gains over time. So, training in this 4-6 rep range is totally necessary as part of any routine, but size and stamina of muscles definitely isn't maximized when solely training in this rep range.  Optimal size and stamina is achieved when one trains in the 8-12 range, but... since strength gains over time will stall if someone only trains in this 8-12 range (since it becomes extremely difficult to add weight to your lifts the higher you get in rep numbers), you need to make sure you are increasing the weight over time in your lower rep ranges i.e. 4-6.  This will translate to more strength in your higher rep ranges (8-12), and so when you train in both low and high ranges, you will then have maximal strength, size, and stamina over time without stalling.  The author doesn't mention this at all--probably because he doesn't know it or isn't really sure.  Plus training solely in the 6 reps and below range is BAD for you joints and you run a much higher risk of injury, especially for a beginner.  You can't get stronger when you are injured.<br /><br />The author also contradicts himself (unintentionally no doubt) creating confusion.  He says that in one part that meal timing doesn't matter--yet later in the book he says you shouldn't go too long in between meals or you risk losing muscle...  So which is it?  We're left to wonder.  Another example was about &#34;muscle confusion,&#34; which he asserts is total BS, but in the very same sentence says that it is very important to change your routine up once in a while.  I think I know what he is trying to say, but it's not clear--especially to the layman.<br /><br />This guy has good intentions, but at the end of the day he's really just trying to promote exactly what works FOR HIM.  We all have a tendency to want to do this.  To the person reading; I'd advise them to always question what you hear about fitness and nutrition.  There are mountains of false information out there, seriously.  Best advice is to get the basics and see what works best for you by being adventurous in trying new things, and not caring SO MUCH about what your body looks like.  We all die, remember?  Is any of your value really found in your physique? Personally, I think not.  And personally, I find all of my value in Jesus Christ who doesn't care how big, lean or strong I am.  That was in my review to point some of you who read this to true rest.

0345803450|4.0|...but that's fine. I think it gets lumped in to the genre as booksellers attempt to market it. I really liked this book, beautifully written, well formed characters, and a terrific but deliberately minimal and personal story. I particularly like the treatment of a somewhat independant female character interacting with a patriarchal bureaucracy, time and culture.

B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Now, let's take that same $1,000 bond and let's assume that interest rates rise so that an investor can get a similar bond with a 6% yield. If you tried to sell your 5% bond for $1,000 an investor would be foolish to buy it when they can get a bond that pays 6% for $1,000. So, in order to sell the bond, you'll have to give a discount on the price. Say you offer to sell your bond for $800. The bond still pays $50 per year so that means that the current rate is now $50/$800 or 6.25%. The investor would now be wise to purchase your bond at a current yield of 6.25% versus the other bond at 6%. Of course, to sell the bond, you had to lose $200 via the discount you provided. That's why rising interest rates are bad for holders of bonds. The opposite is also true. Falling interest rates make the value

B000FBFN1U|4.0|Once you get over the fact that you will never remember who is who in the book - except maybe for the few main characters, the reading is smooth. Book is much shorter when you skip the exhausting details of garb etc. seems like Mr. Martin wanted to make sure the book will have all the required details when transformed into a film (tv series). In all, a very gripping and enjoyable both Arthurian and Machiavellian plot.

B000EWBKKI|3.0|As for the film itself, of course it's phenomenal,  just about everything you want in an action movie. I wanna talk about the disk itself; first off, for Blu-Ray, I was never really blown away by the picture quality, it seemed like a really high quality DVD than Blu-Ray. Minor note; this might be a stupid thing to complain about, but for me, the menus seemed a bit cumbersome to navigate. Lastly, the most striking thing about this disk is the absolute lack of any special features, aside from 2 different commentary tracks. Is there really not any material to include? With this film, you could have a 2 hour special just on the effects, not to mention actor interviews and deleted scenes. That's the worst, cause I know there are tons of deleted scenes.

B0035V35P8|4.0|I bought this movie because of the actor...Rain. I knew that with an R rating there would be violence - especially with Ninjas and Assassins. This movie didn't fail in this regard. I was a little disappointed that Rain wasn't used to the fullest with his personality and presence onscreen. The movie was of a dark nature and didn't allow his sense of humor to show. He did a great job with the role he was given, and he was in great shape for the stunts.<br /><br />That being said, if you don't mind a lot of CG blood and slicing, this is a good action movie.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I am now addicted to The Good Wife! It was recommended by a friend after I told her I was sad that &#34;Parenthood&#34; season had ended and I'm glad I started watching it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun and entertaining especially while your laying in bed trying to fall asleep it relaxes you ... anyway it's awesome and a good way to pass time I hope this review helped and yeah bye :)
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I am still having charging issues I have to play with the cord to get it to charge and sometimes it stops chargins overnight have no idea why  not sure if the wire is at fault or the kindle
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Sasha Cohen what more do I have to say.. It's a funny movie if you understand the raw sense of comedy he brings to life.. Great movie
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Seems to do what I need it to. I haven't explored all the features, but don't use a lot of them on the computer as it is.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Love the movies and got this set for 20$. Couldn't pass up this deal. Had the collection on dvd, but have been wanting this since I got a Blu-ray player.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I would say, the secret of happiness is in this book.<br />I will recommend this book to my friends.<br />Try to read this book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not usually a huge fan of futuristic type books, but this was a true page turner! I was so glad I finally gave into the hype to read this and the rest of the trilogy.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|The actors play well together.Interesting plot,dialogue and over all very interesting story.I would advise watching this movie.I may watch again soon.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Bought this when it was a special 'free kindle' book and really enjoyed it. Once I was into the story I couldn't stop reading it. Read the second half of the book in one sitting!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am addicted to these &#34;costume dramas.&#34;  They are far better than almost anything available on American TV.<br />I can't wait for Season 4.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun - just wish they had more levels.  Good problem solving puzzle that makes you think.  Some sequences are easy, while others will leave you scratching your head for a while.
B009WUBERW|2.0|This movie is the same old thing. Bang bang shoot em up, with little story. If you've seen one, you've seen them all.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It was like an adult version of 'A Wrinkle in Time'.  I would read it again to try to get what I missed the first time.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of these type of movies, but watched it with my hubby who is, and enjoyed it very much. Enough one liners to make it fun.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It is borderline terrible.  The relationship is shallow.  It is a sex read but unrealistic to the way a real passion filled relationship would be.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this series. Read it twice in a row. Great read at the beach. My new favorite series. Can't wait for the next one.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I can not get enough of this show.  I am from Stockton and to hear them talk of the surrounding areas is kind of cool.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What can you say about this phenomenon but it is just as good as the first two seasons and holds more than a few surprises, What can possibly be happening in season 4 to top this one. Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am constantly playing this game and really enjoy it!  It is great to just keep busy during baseball games.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I really enjoy reading books by Jeffrey Archer and couldn't wait for this, the third of the series. Each book has ended with a cliffhanger and me needing to know more about the Barrington and Clifton families. Now my question is, When will I know who died in the automobile accident? I cannot wait.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Was hooked after watching the first 15 minutes!!  I really love how they include humor throughout even the darkest of times.
B00D6GT5S8|4.0|Did it again, great album!! If there's one song and only one song to DL it would be Gobbledigook. Definitely a buy.
B000066C1N|5.0|loved it the song were all mostly up beat and also had the just music background  too played great if you like the more up beat song this would be one to get
B00A11AN6O|4.0|saving pictures of personal nature is a good way to have them at your finger tips. great fun for kids
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I got this book with Audible's whisper-sync so I could both read and listen. It was a great experience. The audio book was truly a performance piece.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's really fun and I play it on both of my electronics . I really like uno a lot in person and I'm starting to play it more on my kindle thanks 1million
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's 35 bucks - I've spent more money on lamer products. It does exactly as it's described and the quality is great (it helps if you have a great internet connection and awesome TV).  What I thought was nice was that I could change the chromecast device name to Chinese and Korean characters.<br /><br />I would normally use my PS3 for Netflix, but I can't immediately access Netflix without the constant updates... Majority of the TVs in my house are also Smart TVs with access to Netflix, but the controls are just incredibly lame unless you have a keyboard. The chromecast is really just an easy and quick solution for me to be even lazier when it comes to flinging Youtube and Netflix to the big screen.<br /><br />UPDATE: So I'm pretty late to the game on this one, but apparently you can stream local files from your computer to your Chromecast! When streaming from your computer, launch your Chrome browser (make sure you have the Chromecast Extension installed) and in the URL type the path of your own Local files to play movies.  I've tried it with .avi, .mp4, and .mkv, however, it seems that not all .mkv files use the same audio wrapper so there is a chance that your audio may not play.  It has been mostly smooth with some hiccups on streaming depending how congested the network is, but it's awesome!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I'm on like level 18 of the game and it says a new version is out and to go to the app store to update! How in the world do you update? I've looked everywhere for an update option,and can't find one! Can someone please help me out here?
B00CMEQD30|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!!  It was wonderful! It has adventure, love, sorcery, magic, fantasy, loss.  It was a great story!!  I highly recommend reading it!!!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This looks like it would be really fun with the full version. The demo only lets you play for a few minutes, then it shuts you out. But you can create as many worlds as you want.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app is cumbersome and makes the experience less pleasurable than being on my computer, its rubbish and I have stopped using it
B0038P80CO|4.0|Wow, read some harsh reviews! Many of you missed your calling to become professional critics.  Just sit down and enjoy it for daring to be different. All about expectations. It's actually a film not about aliens. That's just one reason to like it.<br /><br />Gallo/Payton was a very intense struggle. Two minds battling for control. Finally you learn his dark secret. The cruelty he inflected on his crew. On the whole ship. The extent of his mental breakdown. One of the parts I liked the best. Cam did a wonderful job here protraying Gallo's character. You really felt what Gallo went through. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost..<br /><br />Bower learned how to take control. When he lost contact with his \\"C.O\\" it was a key point in the movie. Payton had kept Bower because he was the \\"boy scout\\", always following orders. You learn in the beginning Bower was \\"especially selected\\". Payton corrected his mistake after by adding they were all especially selected. At the end Bower asserted himself from Payton. Finally not taking orders.<br /><br />Leland was just someone who had spend way to much time by himself. Don't want to know what the green stuff was on the walls. Wish we could've known more about his history. Perhaps he learned what had happened from pre-dinner conversation with fellow crew members? He seemed to have learned his eating habits from the mutants.  He definitely made the story more dramatic.<br /><br />Mutants were scary enough, thank you. Crunching, disembowling.. Blood oozing from their mouths after a meal. WHATEVER, that's enough for me. The whole cannibal thing. The whole \\"watch where you step\\" wearing what looked like peeled off human skin. The sitting in a human disposal pond.<br /><br />I think what I loved the best was Bower's character. You could really relate to what he was going through. He fumbled and made mistakes like any normal person would. He was not afraid to admit he didn't know what the hell he was doing. He went from the obedient puppyto a more assertive, leader role. With a little humour that always helps. When he used to crowd control gun on Nadia and Manh was funny. It was like when kids are fighting and you flash the lights on and off to get their attention. And when he finally gets sick and tired of Nadia beating on him.<br /><br />I loved the movie and currently waiting for it in the mail from Amazon.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|What a lovely movie and such an uplifting true story of overcoming stereotypes and truly accepting people for who they are! I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a great Musical/drama/romantic/comedy!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book..a must read! Auggie's story is emotional yet life changing. Finished in two days.. couldn't put the book down!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|just got my restaurant up and running. please add me........kita35.  I will tip and gift back.thank you .stop. by and see
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I do like this app but it takes a long long time to load. But other than that it's a really good app and it does have adds as well. I say it pretty good. But it could be better.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Takes a warts and all look at George. Has a lot of depth -- way more than a Beatles fanboy movie. Incredible music. You must watch it with a great stereo and other supplies...
B006PZBR8S|5.0|I wanted to see this movie a long time ago, but just watched it for the first time. I was pretty impressed, especially because the movie was high quality and decently clean.<br /><br />Amazon's instant video service is definitely competitive with the other services out there. The streaming works well, and they have great selection. The only improvement needed is for them to add the subtitles option.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!!!! I haven't had a game to challenge me in a while!!!!! I found myself never wanting to stop playing
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is not just kinky it's a true love story! Best book I have read n a really long time.
1476733953|4.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. as the cover said, you will live in this world. i strongly considered going ahead and giving it the full five stars, but i realized i needed to reserve that for on a select few books. But the fact that i considered it is a testament to how much i liked reading it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the app but Amazon does not update like ios does 7.3 has large chests and moon sun and stars also the chests open like Pc does
B00992CF6W|4.0|I give it 4 stars because the update is very very late my cousin has a ipod and it is already had two update but other then that it's a good game
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I liked that it was brand new with the plastic seal on it so I knew none of the pieces were lost.
B009ME47H2|5.0|This is a great app. I use it to record my vocal lessons and listen it later. It's helpful and records for a long time.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|quite a good book. Taught me  thing or too aboyt love.and how to treaet aminal wounds and papyrus paper implanted gimp
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Has many of the same qualities but definitly fun and enjoy able for fans of the movies. Great price as well
B00DB97LCM|4.0|In May 2009, Paramount released [[ASIN:B001TH16DI Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection (Star Trek I, II, III, IV, V, VI + The Captain's Summit Bonus Disc) [Blu-ray]]], which contained the six Original Crew 'Star Trek' films ('The Motion Picture' - 'The Undiscovered Country') in their theatrical cuts, numerous special features both old and new and a bonus disc of brand new content known as 'Star Trek: The Captains' Summit'. Later that year, in September, the same studio released [[ASIN:B002I9Z8GW Star Trek: The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection (First Contact /  Generations / Insurrection / Nemesis) [Blu-ray]]], which contained the four 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' films ('Generations' - 'Nemesis'), with identical special features as their previous DVD editions, along with a bonus disc of varied new featurettes.<br /><br />Star Trek: The Stardate Collection is simply the consolidation of these two 'Star Trek' boxed sets; nothing more, nothing less. The 12 discs (10 movies and 2 bonus discs) are packaged in two tri-fold cardboard/plastic disc holders, which in turn slide into a sturdy cardboard box, taking up very little shelf space. Somewhat annoyingly, the discs are \\"stacked\\" two per plastic casing, so that one has to remove the top disc in order to get at the bottom disc. This is especially annoying considering that, with the 'Star Trek' film franchise's \\"even-number rule,\\" the discs on the bottom are precisely the ones you're probably going to want to get at more often!<br /><br />This boxed set is clearly for casual fans as opposed to die-hards, who would have all these movies/bonus materials already. Some fans (on Amazon and elsewhere) have been complaining that Paramount is releasing all the films again, without any added special features, and none in their director's cuts. I ask these fans plainly and simply: Would they rather have the studio re-release all these films just as they were presented in their previous home video editions, or would they have the studio add a few token bonus features so that they, as true fans of the series, would feel obligated to buy all the movies again, thus eating up money and shelf space? I am not saying that this excuses Paramount for not releasing the director's cuts on Blu-ray; I am simply saying that, in my opinion, some fans are missing the point of this release.<br /><br />The bottom line, as I see it, is as follows: If you are a casual 'Star Trek' fan, or a 'Trek' fan new to Blu-ray, then this is the set for you. If you already have all the films on Blu-ray--especially in the two boxed sets mentioned above--then you will find (both literally and figuratively) nothing added in this collection. Either way, The Stardate Collection represents the best, most complete 'Star Trek' film franchise anthology available to date, although fingers remain crossed for director's cuts in HD.<br /><br />One final note: This movie compilation has nothing to do whatsoever with the book series of the same name. [[ASIN:1613777116 Star Trek: The Stardate Collection, Volume 1]] is, rather, an omnibus of 'Star Trek' comic books, volume one of which is being released this October.ould they have the studio add a few token bonus features so that they, as true fans of the series, would feel obligated to buy all the movies again, thus eating up money and shelf space?

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I love this game its really enjoyable but there are many glitches in this game i recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I did the required update on this game that I LOVE playing.....only to not be able to continue to play the game that I LOVE so much!!!! The new update loaded only to tell me to go to the app store...and all I'm getting is the run around there.....there is no app!  All I get is an open button....after pushing that all it does is bring me back to screen to tell me my app has to be downloaded in the app store! WHAT THE HE K IS GOING ON???!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game for children and adults it's just like both of the movies meena is so cute but evil
B002JC9RMY|2.0|My grand daughter reented it and did not finish watch because they do not look like the game figures.Oh well.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A boy who doesn't want to go to school, but ends up having a better time with kids his own age. This book brought me to tears. Happy. And sad.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wow wow! so much fun .love it so fun. play it not bad at all. great play it . It a problem solving game. So I think it's a good challenge.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm Mad cause I don't get updates I've been waiting like 2 month's for minecraft pe to update I'm pist .But the game is still good but this sucks.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I find it fun when you have coins to play with. My patience runs a bit short when  I'm out of coins but it is a fairly simple and easy game to play.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|it works good would tell my friends about it so they can buy it too. instead of using the computer
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Totally hooked on pandora experience and the extra screens add greatly to the story. A must buy for true fans.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|This is a VERY amazing book. Being based on a true story adds to the suspense and sadness felt throughout the book. That being said, it was (I hate to say this) boring for me. I'm a 12 year old teenager, so I think this is why. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this book for anyone (except myself, of course) ;).
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a nice conclusion to the Hunger games.  Although it can get a little troubling since not everyone makes it out alive.  And some of the deaths are quite unexpected.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|A little predictable, but still a fast good read with several surprises. Some holes and a few assumptions that need to be made and then the story fits together.
B000I2JI80|5.0|Fantastic film. We have had great success with fine portraits and wedding photography using this film. Works beautifully with a Contax 645
B003VANOFY|3.0|my surround sound does not work the only thing is the surround sound I would give it 5 stars but that's important
B009R659L8|5.0|Excellent plot<br />keeps you guessing and wanting more<br />Love the progression of clues and characters<br />she made you identify with each character
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Just updated game and now getting go to app store. What's wrong, very enjoyable game and now it's ruined. HOW DO WE FIX THIS?
B00AALX5SI|4.0|This is a very good movie. I was surprised, not so much that it was god but the whole getting into her life and seeing her back stage etc. it was much better then I thought
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Tons of fun. Very enjoyable - challenging, but not frustrating. Look forward to playing often. Would definitely recommend to game lovers.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love the thrill of the book. It is so interesting. I love each and every moment. I am crazy for this book.
B000VS6QTK|5.0|Not too new and not too old, I think this performance found the band in fine form. Would of liked to have been there.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I have bought this product numerous times and they always wind up shorting out slightly after three month which incidentally marks the end of the warranty period. I don't know if the are manufactured this way or what. I have tried to keep the cord straight and always make sure it is not twisted, but always wind up with a short nonetheless. I have bought this product numerous times, due to the availability and cost. Now this product costs $30+ dollars, when it used to be $10. Crazy and not worth the money. Honestly you are better off with another product.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Aslan clearly did his homework, the history of the area is impeccable and the narrative he weaves is interesting. I would recommend if you want to get an appreciation for the world in which Jesus lived.
B00E25KVLW|4.0|Was pleasantly surprised to read this book, I am yet to finish the book but so far it appears to help me a lot in understanding basic concepts of Ruby on Rails.
B001GULEYY|5.0|I must confess that I did not read the other stories in this condesnsed volume, only \\"the Black Ship.\\"  This was a story based on factual historical events in World War II with some fictitious \\"what ifs\\" along the way. An American admiral and British admiral  agreed to have an American naval unit support the English in the North Atlantic, so this is how a small squadron of Patrol Torpedo (PT) boats deployed to the United Kingdom instead of the Pacific. Another \\"what if\\" was that the brutal \\"SS\\" had a marine section that operated this one destroyer at least in the Kriegsmarine. The destroyer was very good at gunnery and overwhelmed the English Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) as well as the destroyers sent to trap her as she escorted coal and ore from Sweden down the coast to Germany (a factual occurrence).  The use of the black-shirted sailors in this story was used to bring in the oppression of the Dutch and the occupation of \\"Gronhaven\\" with their typical SS-atrocities (although it was likely to have been that harsh anyway). After training up with the English, the Americans sail into harm's way, and of course get blasted to pieces, with ENS Craig's boat getting one torpedo into the \\"Horst Wessel\\" or \\"Black Ship.\\"  Picked up by the Dutch underground, he is spirited through the maze of Dutch trader houses where they meet and plan the destruction of the \\"Back Ship.\\" A well written, and well illustrated story, although short as it is \\"condensed.\\"  Highly recommended if you can find one!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much I watched it twice. I do have one question. Am I the only one that noticed when Leanardo's character is interviewing the residents of the asylum that in one scene someone looks like they are picking up a glass to drink, but when they lift their hand to their mouth there is no glass in their hand...... accident or on purpose????
B007SGM084|5.0|Delivered right to my kindle app!!! Couldn't get the 2nd & 3rd one quick enough, but kindle digital copy helped solve that problem for me. 50 Shades was a must read, I couldn't put it down. It kept me intwrested and hooked me from the beginning, to gueas what would happen next or how the love story would unfold. Some things were a little repetative with sex, & at times not the best writing. Overall though I enjoyed the whole series and read it fairly quickly.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|What a great twist! Great actors doing what they do best. The right amount of suspense and intrigue. Loved it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|PLEASE FIX THE NEW UPDATE. GAME JUST KEEPS SAYING THAT THERE IS A NEW UPDATE AND I CANT PLAY ANYMORE?!!!! I LOVE THIS GAME UNTIL THAT!!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Although this movie did take a turn I was not expecting, it was lacking a lot of detail. Not sure I would want to watch it again.
B0064MGU98|5.0|love this show. its the perfect combination of interesting plot and witty characters. can't keep away from this show! :)
B003PIS5XI|5.0|I know, I know, it's old.... but this is a classic movie. Was great in the 80's and is still a favorite!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It works. No frills. No fuss. It let's me know my battery is charging and where it's at in the process.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|9 very easy to do experiments that will change your perception of reality - in a good way, definitely worth your time:)
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Well worth the five bucks.  It took me to oblivion for a while.  The ending was a little confusing but maybe I'm gettin too old.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I have read this book several times and will probibly read it again. Is not Lord of the Rings but one of the closest to it....
148410031X|4.0|I bought this book for my grandson. It is required reading for the 8th grade. I pray that this and the other books will give him back the love of reading.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Grabs your attention from the beginning and just keeps on going!  I can't wait for the next book in the series!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I updated on my original Kindle Fire,and it didn't ask for any content.Free version gets updates not as quickly.Even though its 99 cents, I think its worth it.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|I purchased a bunch of books to read and am looking forward to reading them in the near future.  A+
B000I9YWDO|5.0|This movie is great. If you work in an office and have a sense of humor at all you will love it.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Good movie.  Not the best, but there are some scenes and parts of the movie where I was laughing out loud.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Good song, catchy lyrics, I love it. Perez Hilton can blow all the smoke he wants up Katy Perry's ass and ROAR-which is another good song by it's own right-but this is the one I won't tire of so easily.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Tried the free version and loved it.  Had to get the real version to find out what happens.  Game play is similar to Mist, graphics are really good considering its a kindle app, and the mini games are fun. Great work G5!
B005IQZB14|4.0|This story was all about the author coming to terms with her grief and finding herself and not very much about the hike itself. But it's hard not to be bemused at her complete and utter lack of knowledge or preparation for the undertaking. Her naivete borders on irresponsible. Yet she completed the journey. Her writing style had me laughing out loud from time to time and overall I have to say I really enjoyed the read.
0738711500|5.0|I had thought about reading for years, but it was too overwhelming. One day, I came across this lovely set and my life changed forever. I would recommend the Easy Tarot Book to anyone nervous about Tarot or feeling like it's \\"too hard\\" to learn. Josie Ellershaw's technique is very easy to pick up and positive. I get no feeling of dark and doom. That's why the Gilded deck appeals to me as well. The illustrations are so cheerful and colorful. The cards all appear as forces for good. Tarot can be very helpful and insightful and I only use them to help others. Cards are a great guide but not a master. They have been a great journey and Josie's book shows that anyone can learn!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game its the best game I got on my kindle fire I found out you can go to island to island without dying! all you do it go under and jump as far as you can than keep going. forward
B006O3MU96|5.0|My son loves Doodle Jump, so Doodle Jump Christmas was a no-brainer.  Same good fun with a Christmas theme.  Hard to lose that bet.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved the game, just wish there were more rooms! Challenging enough, and fun puzzles. I want to play more, but have already beaten it :(
B009WO7NQO|4.0|If you like Angry Birds and/or Star Wars, this is a game for you.  Rovio has done an admirable job of marrying the Star Wars franchise and their avian heroes.  The only thing I dock it a star for is the absurd level of difficulty to get 3 stars on most levels.  Yes, there's often a trick or a specific spot you have to hit to get the highest rank, but there's two problems with the way you get ranked:<br /><br />1) In the vast majority of circumstances you have to only use a single bird as remaining birds are required to get your score high enough to get 3 stars.  This sucks because the powers the birds have are a lot of fun to use and being constrained to the only first bird ad infinitum until you hit the magic score mark feels more like a grind than a game.  &#34;So forgo the score and just play the levels for fun&#34; you say.  Ah, well there's the rub.  You only unlock additional worlds and bonuses based on your score count.  If you want to play the whole game, you _must_ get a fair amount of stars.<br />2) Most levels require a degree of luck rather than skill to get all 3 stars.  The target score is high enough on most levels you have to do a certain amount of damage to the environment in order to pop the 3rd star.  It's irritating to kill all the pigs with one bird and get 2 stars because a block that was supposed to break didn't fall and give you the 10 points you needed to cross the line.  Personally, I think if you can kill all the pigs with one bird, it should be an automatic 3 star award regardless of score.<br /><br />All that said, ABSW is great fun.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great Movie. kids were glued to the storyline. It was great fun. Ralph was a likable character with a great heart.  It was great as an adult to see my old retro video game heroes alive in the surge protector. haha.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|By far a movie Jennifer Beals will always be remembered as that girl from Pittsburgh.<br />Won an Oscar for best music.<br />A film that will be remembered and probably not rated a particularly good.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like this game a lot it's just that I need the the new update. My friend already has it on his iPod but is not yet available on kindle fire. Need help!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Need more levels, I can't get enough! So much fun, engaging and entertaining and addictive. On demon spawn! On gargoyles! Oh it is so much fun only wish there were more levels in the games.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Keeps telling me to go to app store n update but can't fix the issue cause there is no update I need. Guess I can't play anymore. VERY disappointed.
B00819ER0Q|5.0|It was a pretty darn tootin good ol movie.  Jimmy was great in it.  Also the FBI agent from the show The Americans on FX is in it.  He's mmkay as well.  Mmkay
B00D3V8PSC|4.0|Taking into account how old these guys are,  this album is brilliant.  It's not Paranoid, but it definitely will remind you of the glory days.
B00153ZC8Q|4.0|This one was also downloaded by my Grandson when I was in California.  I don't know that I have ever seen it, although I may have.  It is certainly the type of movie a 9 year old boy would enjoy.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I heard somewhere that AccuWeather will start forecasting weather up to 45 days in advance.  I think they need to figure out how to forecast 4 hours in advance before going all out.<br /><br />I was not really impressed with the forecasting nor the radar map.  As soon as the Weatherbug app became available for my device, I jumped ship.
B00AGH6FD8|4.0|This was downloaded and watched by my grandson when I was in California.  He liked it, and had already downloaded Home Alone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Again, have been hooked since the first season, will be impatient until season 4 comes.  I also got my daughter hooked into and she loves it too..
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|takes concentration and keeps you attention. Excellent game, fast country it and you won't be able to put it down
B000FC146C|4.0|Another book I read back in a day. It's always nice to reread some of the greatest stories written. I normally don't go for love stories, this one was an exception.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|A lovely story that is faithful to the spirit of the Jane Austen novel. The main characters are believable in their roles because they are not Hollywood types that look pretty but lack substance. The whole cast seems real and are very talented. The main character's facial expressions are subtle but very meaningful so you have to pay close attention to understand what is happening. This is a wonderful adaptation that I recommend to anyone who enjoys subtle acting, clever dialog and beautiful settings. Enjoy!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This app has been awesome. I've even figured out ways to bypass some of the aggravations. Crops keep dying? No problem. I made an Apple orchard instead. Planted about 25 apple trees, put a fence around them and decorated it with a wheelbarrow of chopped wood and some buckets of tomatoes (which I pretend are buckets of apples). I don't use any profits to purchase crops because the trees generate food for free and I can take as long as I want to collect the food because it won't wither and die. Win!<br /><br />Keep running out of wood and the land expansions take too long to be able to collect from their trees? Not me! I have a tree farm. Whenever I need wood I'll chop them all down to right before they turn into stumps. I get all the wood I need and by the time I come back to play they're all grown again.<br /><br />I love this game. I previously got to level 84 but had to start over because I got a new kindle and all my progress was lost. I was really sad at first and almost didn't want to have to start over from square one, but my new town is even better and I'm already at level 79 (just a few points shy of 80 and I'm dying for all the new buildings!)<br /><br />When I opened the app this morning and it told me to visit the app store for a download I was excited! New buildings? New decorations? Return of the missing swan or red rose bush!?! I couldn't wait! Until I experienced what everyone else has been frustratingly experiencing, a never ending loop of despair.<br /><br />I'm hoping this situation gets resolved because I don't have it in me to start over yet again, but I will be very sad to uninstall the app. I'm going to check back in 10 hours and I'll be crossing my fingers until then. Please, please, pleeeeeease fix the problem!! My buildings need me! I was just about to collect enough hand drills to fix my eight houses that are currently either on fire, in a wind tunnel, being shot at by dudes on evil horses, or being drenched by science-defying thunder clouds.s.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|This was a really good book and and I learned something about the WWII fliers that I didn't know before.  (And yes I verified it on-line).  Without spoiling the ending for others, it sure ended differently than any of the other JR books.
0140143505|5.0|I had read this light book a couple of times before, but did not own a copy.  When we received this, my wife and I both re-read it and enjoyed it as much as before.
B000P407K4|5.0|Must see. Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, James Earl Jones ...and the infamous Col Jack D. Ripper. Classic Cold War hi-jinks with a sharp satirical edge. Fun movie. Excellent film production, great scene sets. B-52 action and nuclear explosions! Yee Haw!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am addicted to this game. my brothers and sisters are always asking... &quot;can I play minion rush?&quot; inbetween bouts of holding my newborn son. I love that its kid friendly and I can let them play. so many games anymore aren't.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|You'll love the characters, though the development follows typical first seasons jumps.  Stories are brilliant and the interaction between the actors is excellent.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun great! Awesome awesome awesome!! Wonderful spectacular great fabulous!if. We're to change anything it'd be to make more money quicker! But who doesn't complain about that!lol
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's real easy and I love it. I play on it all the time it's  my best game I've ever had.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like the update. I use it on my Kindle Fire and have no problem with it. I would like to see the barometer, though, with up- down-steady indicators. That is the only reason I gave it a 4-star instead of 5.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|the main story line is great, reminds me of a good game of D&D.  Would have given it 5 stars but Im upset the third book is not out yet.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is the best show ever and this order came as expected.  I wish I would have bought all of the seasons on Blu-ray.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game. Easy to level up and there is always something to do which never leaves you bored. Love this game! Even my 7 year old daughter understands the game play!
6304806418|5.0|My mom asked for this for x-mas and she was tickled pink that we could order it for her.  The price and shipping we good and we were happy with the order.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|I got this cd because I was feeling a bit nostalgic after seeing Sir Paul in concert in Tulsa. The cd takes you thru many of the Beatles hits and a good mix of the McCartney and Wings songs with a few of  his solo hits in between. I think I would have liked it better if the cd had been from one of his more recent concerts, because he is singing alot more of the stuff you don't hear on the radio anymore. If you are a McCartney Fan you will love it! It's also a good road music CD (long distance travel on the interstate)
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|My mom asked for this for x-mas and she was tickled pink that we could order it for her.  The price and shipping we good and we were happy with the order.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|This is a awesome cd that takes you thru all of Huey Lewis and the News Greatest Hits. If you a Huey fan you will love it!
B0053O89XI|5.0|This is the best show ever and this order came as expected.  I wish I would have bought all of the seasons on Blu-ray.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|I have not seen (or heard) whichever is appropriate for this item.  I am unable to evaluate its quality for that reason.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is the best show ever and this order came as expected.  I wish I would have bought all of the seasons on Blu-ray.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|Draws you in with great prose until you find yourself consumed by the story. Very fun read, highly recommend it
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is the best show ever and this order came as expected.  I wish I would have bought all of the seasons on Blu-ray.
1616550414|5.0|Bought this book for my husband as a gift. But my kid really enjoys this book. Pictures are so good.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book should be the gold standard for the zombie genre.  Don't see the movie as apparently none of the people involved in it's making read the book.
B004ZZS4CC|1.0|I JUST COULDN'T READ THE BOOK. IT WAS TO MUCH FOR ME. IT WASN'T THAT I DIDN'T LIKE IT. WHAT THIS CHILD WENT THROUGH I COULDN'T IMAGINE. I HAD TP PUT IT DOWN. I DID READ SOME OF IT, I JUST HAD TO PUT IT DOWN AND PICK IT  BACK UP. I SO PLEASED AND HAPPY THAT THIS YOUNG GIRL AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE AND TRY TO GO ON WITH THEIR LIVES.
1608871827|5.0|This book is phenomenal. You get lots of extras such as posters, stickers, etc. If you loved Pacific Rim as much as I did, then you will absolutely treasure this book. The monster concept drawings that weren't used in the film are enough to validate the price. The conceptual art is fantastic and it is so interesting to see how the designs that they chose to use in the film evolved. This book shows you all of that and delves deeper into the mythos of the Pacific Rim universe. This is a must have.
B00CIFK316|4.0|Sherlock Holmes is the original master of using logic and deduction to solve mysteries.  Each adventure was an easy read, wonderfully written and not easy to puzzle out.<br />I very much want to read more of the mysteries Doyle has him solve.
B005DN5BE4|5.0|Such an inspiring story. Definitely worth watching. Humanity at its best and worst. I like the fact that it doesn't gloss over the forced labor that existed even in the African culture these slaves came from or that it was other African tribes that did the kidnapping and selling to the slave traders. But God's design for men to be free (and to treat each other with dignity and respect) prevails in the end - at least for them.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who wants to see into the mind of a lost American Warrior.  He was one of America's best and a real American Hero.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Mininon Rush is a reasonably attractive infinite runner. It is really fun at first, but as you get into the game, you realize where it lacks. It feels like Gameloft wasn't trying to do anything but get a quick check. The audio? Ripped strait from the movie! The currency? Bananas, which is funny, but when you look to the distance and you see the bananas aren't spinning until you get close, you notice how lazy Gameloft was. And the missions are fine at first, until you find out that you HAVE to give them your FaceBook information, otherwise it is EXTREMELY hard to move on. Overall, this game is just... well... meh... If you want a good infinite runner, look to Subway Surfers, and find a game that people worked on.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Game was wonderful. I played every day....8 weeks straight.... now the game won't load keeps telling me have a new update..... please fix.....
B005IT0V8O|5.0|It really helped my style. I know now that wearing a monochromatic jumpsuit will get me laid, and not just at the mall before curfew.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great job Rick Riordan  you are a great writer thanks for your time writing the enjoyable series everyone should read this book.
1451695195|1.0|I kept waiting, waiting for details, for a beautiful in-depth description of his near-death experience. It never came. The author says repeatedly that he could go on and on about what he saw in 'Heaven'. But he never says anything other than 'he could go on and on about what he saw.' I was annoyed by references to earth-worm view and core and butterfly wing. There is a constant reminder of how his illness was supposed to be terminal. Good writing says something once or twice. Bad writing repeats ad nauseam. This book did the latter. OK, i get it. Bad disease. Death imminent. Somehow you survive. That is story enough, really, provided you know how to write it well. But details are so scant on Heaven that the afterlife part of this 'book' really isn't more than one paragraph.<br />  I'm so glad that the author survived this scary disease. But to subject us readers to this atrocious book -- void of details, poorly written, endlessly redundant -- was perhaps worst than what he endured with his illness.<br /> I think this is the worst book I've ever read. I went in unbiased, actually maybe even leaning toward expecting a good read, an enlightened view perhaps. I was incredibly disappointed. The best part of this book is the nice cover and the great title. It goes steeply downhill from there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|OK the game is fun and addictive.<br /><br />BUT I need the update to play with my friends.<br />And in multiplayer my kindle freezes when I try it. Like FOREVER.<br />So two stars until fixed.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Thank you Amazon when  I asked for update they gave it to me!<br />Yes I'm so happy it works got the latest version and I can play with...<br />  MY FRIENDS! YEAH!<br />All I'm saying is thank you for the update.<br /><br />~Sea Pops
B00992CF6W|2.0|I like this app but I cant even play with aneroid and ios users. the reason is because amazon haze a horribal system and the app store only has about 5,000 apps and all of them are crappy we only have 0.7.1 but android and ios users have 0.7.3 the update that really compares pe to Pc its almost the same!
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|The item is spot on what i was after. I believe it arrived one week prior to schedualed date which was fabolous. The quality of the item is great, brand new. I'm very satisfied, thank you. Chris.P
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This story was well constructed, well acted, and suspensefully written.  The hero is believeable, the action interesting, the family dynamic intriguing, and the bad guys are so bad.  It is thrilling, fun entertainment.  That is what heroes are about.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I just got this game and I can not play AT ALL. Keeps telling me that there is a newer version of this game and I need to update it, but yet when I go to the app store there is no update. This NEEDS to be fixed, haven't played at all so it is difficult to determine if it is any good. Very disappointed...
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|Beautiful voice! I was very glad to find this album! This is a Must Buy for Anybody! Please listen if you have not listened to this before - wonderful...
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Ba plot, confusing story. Acting was OK. Wife fell asleep watching if that tells you  any thing. Would not reccomend
B000V6738U|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I fell n love again, I even relived the argument I had w/Mom about the song FM! Mom said FM was a dirty word & I had to get rid of album & I said it was Funked up music - it was late 70s - what can I say? These r Great songs! Timeless...
B00ECUARO8|4.0|The ending did not say much, the plot and story kept my interesting and the acting was great. I recommend this movie to both young and old.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I was So glad to find another album by this person. I would buy more if I could find it! Awesome music and the voice is fantastic!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was very life like and well done.  The flood scenes were amazing.  It was a good movie and well acted.
B000063V8S|4.0|The stories get better, the characters gain depth and the dialogue improves.The show continues to improve from season to season.
B00BF123WG|1.0|A terrible movie with lots of hype..the actual raid was only a few minutes of a long story filled with f words and terrible acting<br />Not recommended.. a terrible waste of time...skip it ...
B000PMG16U|3.0|Episode 1 is a little rough to get through, but Episodes 2 and 3 get better.  and it looks good on Blu-ray.
B004RKXN44|4.0|Hot and sizzling.  The book was long enough to savor all the characters, and care about them. I want more!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|What can I say, this is my childhood.  Even now there are moments in these three movies that still thrill me.  And let's give some credit for the series staying power.  For certain age groups (per-adolescence) it still has appeal.
B00DYMM76Q|3.0|Purchased after praises from IMUS. I like Vince Gill a lot and have lots of his music. Still the remake doesn't live up to the original versions of the songs by Buck Owens and Merle Haggard unless of course you don't like one or the other of the original singers.
B007SGM084|5.0|Heard a lot about this series before I ever even read the synopsis.  Once I started reading, it was very difficult to put down and left me wanting more.  Great read!
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|I rented the movie first before I purchased it. Anytime you make a prequel (or sequel) you never know what you're going to get. I gave it a perfect rating for the following reasons.<br /><br />Very good acting: You didn't have your typical &#34;A list&#34; movie stars, which I'm fine with. There were some recognizable faces such as Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis, and James Franco. Names you know but maybe not too well. Nobody over acted. You could tell it felt genuine which means they had some very good writers.<br /><br />Historicity: Since L. Frank Baum did not write a prequel to &#34;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&#34; the script writers of this movie had their work cut out for them trying to cog together how each scene or scenario would have or could have happened leading up to the 1939 film. The tiniest mistake and anyone who know the &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; by heart would have noticed. The historicity was magnificent.<br /><br />Plot and story: The plot isn't a straight forward &#34;this is how it happened&#34;. The writers and producers led you on a wild goose hunt while the story unfolded. Almost like a great mystery novel &#34;who done it&#34;. They did it in a good way though. If you haven't seen it then you don't know what I mean. If you have then you know what I'm talking about (SPOILER: Wicked Witch).<br /><br />Overall: Great family movie. It's as clean as the 1939 film. Cinematography was good and the CGI wasn't real cheesy. I think this movie goes so well with the original plot that you could watch this movie and &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; back to back and it would be near flawless in the storyline.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|says update but can not. please fix so can continue to play. game was working fine untill the latest update came through. game does not work at all know.
1400052181|5.0|A fascinating, true story that becomes a history of what we now know as &#34;informed consent&#34; of patients who are being used for medical research. Henrietta Lacks was a poor black woman whose cancer cells were harvested as she lay dying. The cells were sent to medical labs all over the world. But in the early 1950s, patients were not asked for consent for the use of their cells or organs. Her family never consented to the use of her cells, even though they had some kind of limited understanding that good was coming from them. Her family could never afford medical care that they needed. This tale reads like fiction. Its drama, story line and psychological toll on the family were not pretty, nor were they important to the doctors who used the family for its research.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of the best programs.... I regret I didn't watch it 3 seasons ago was able to catch up, by using my kindle,<br />to current season.  It is witty........great plots and I especially love the characters.  Great script writing.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Excellent movie showing how children can be influenced by their peers in a bad way, and how parents are right.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I heard about this when I was in College but never knew what this was about. NOW that the movie came out I have a better understanding and...wow!!!, it is really good, IF you like musicals. The actors/actresses are really good and...you can tell by the way I am writing that I am at a loss for words, just watch it and trust me you will like it IF you like musicals.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|This movie shows how true friends can stick together over the years and stand up for each other no matter what happens
B008Y73940|4.0|This movie is a very interesting movie that has you twisting in the end to figure out &#34;who dun it&#34;.  My wife and I like movies that have twists and turns in the plot so it keeps you guessing to the end.  This movie did a great job in doing that very thing.  Trace Adkins is huge!  See if you can figure out who he is in this movie! Matthew McConaughey is a perfect fit for this part as a somewhat slimy lawyer (aren't they all?).  We watched this with our early teenage boys and had to fast forward thru a couple of inappropriate sexual scenes that the movie could've done without.  That would be my only complaint.
B000063UR1|5.0|This movie should be a must watch even today.  It shows the importance of taking care of our planet and its resources.  I can remember watching this as a young kid and crying when the little robot &#34;died&#34;.
B009LGO88E|2.0|After less than a week, it stopped working all together. Its batteries didn't run out, it was connected properly, but it just stopped working.
B00D97HNC4|5.0|No fan of David Lynch's work should miss out on this.  Very dark & weird, absolute must listen, check it out!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This one of the best gameloft games I have ever played you need to try it you won't regret it
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|First of all, I dislike movies that let you see the obvious ending before they even start developing the plot...( too many of them out there ) Well, this is NOT one of them.  It takes a lot of corners, and keeps you abreast of how each change fits into the whole.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, not withstanding, its hard to find any Tom Hanks movie that isn't good anyway.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever.. When I first herd minecraft IS thought it would be boaring, but now its the best game I ever played. Can't wait until. Minecraft 0.8.0
0307888908|5.0|The Start-Up of You allowed me to see I needed more diversity throughout my network. I took to heart the recommendation to exercise skill sets, interests and experiences in two or more domains, then act as a bridge for my connections in one circle who want to access another.  I was so inspired that I included a short synopsis of the book as part of a map I published that illustrates how individuals and companies can use LinkedIn more effectively: [...]
B001EC2J20|5.0|I love this movie!! It never gets old!! They always thought they were having all the fun by jumping in and out of the matrix, they never suspected that someone would tag along and hitch a ride out of the matrix onto their ship! How does this happen?? You must view the movie to find out, but you absolutely must start with the first one in the series, &#34;The Matrix!&#34;
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I really didn't expect to like this movie very much, so it was a huge surprise that I loved it. The actor that played Jack was so good, and the giants were amazingly real, but also amazingly gross! :o)
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I love these utensils!! And after having these, have ordered more Joseph Joseph products and have grown to love the brand.<br /><br />I have 2 sets of these, the set with the carousel and the set that has the same utensils minus the carousel. I ordered the first set without the carousel and when I came back to order another set I found the one that includes the carousel, which I love, but no biggie, I just hang the others from my over the island pot rack.<br /><br />Okay, to start with, the minute I opened them I loved the way they looked, just like the photo, no disappointments there. The bright colored handles and charcoal utensil color immediately caught my attention when I saw them. I am a creature of color, you wont find a white drab room in my home! I have been very pleased to see this colorful trend of late, it has made shopping much easier for me, I have been a fan of color and decorated my house accordingly long before it was popular to do so.These fit right in my bright multi colored kitchen.<br /><br />On to quality and functionality, These utensils are made of thick sturdy silicone, not the least bit flimsy. The first time I was able to stir a dish of thick homemade mashed potatoes without any bending I fell in love, in the past I have had to use a metal or wooden spoon to stir thick or heavy dishes, any of you ladies that cook will know exactly what I'm referring too.<br /><br />The colored handles are comfy an sturdy as well. The balancing feature works perfectly, never allowing the end to rest on the surface, eliminating the need for spoon rest or paper towels on the counter. This feature also allows you to balance the utensils on the outer edge of a bowl and stand the utensil up beside it, as appose having to lay it on top or across your mixing or serving bowl.<br /><br />I haven't had the opportunity yet to test the high heat durability as of yet, I have used them while pan cooking with no melting or probs., But having a smooth glass/granite top stove and having learned the hard way about how hot the eyes stay after using, I have trained myself to keep utensils off of and away from my stove top LOL!  So I cant say how they may function when coming in contact with a hot element or other extreme heat.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about this set is the shape. The unique shape of the spoon, slotted spoon, spatula and pasta spoon make them very useful for multi functions, you can use them to stir and serve dishes, stir frying foods etc. instead of designating certain utensils to certain functions. The only exception being the ladle, a ladle is a pretty function specific tool.<br /><br />I find myself reaching for these over all my other kitchen utensils and can see myself totally replacing all of them with these. I already have two sets, with the diverse functionality of these utensils this would prob be enough for the average household kitchen, but we have a family of 6, my hubby and I and 4 kiddos and usually always have a house full of company and do plenty of entertaining, so I plan to order a few more sets.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie, and I never really did. Every time I put it in to watch it, I fell asleep a quarter of the way into it. I might be a amazing movie and I just have narcolepsy, but I have a feeling it might be because it's boring.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|I read the book in 3 days and was unable to put it down at times , it was spellbinding. I would skip ahead to keep reading about arya, cersei , or jamie  but all characters were equally enthralling
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This one has a lot of plot twists that I didn't see coming. Of course, I love anything that Morgan Freeman is in! He's one of the great actors around these days.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Was a great, fun game until update time. Now I can't even open the game. All good things must come to an end, I guess....
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|This film was a bit boring but good enough that I watched it to the end. I don't think I would want to watch it again, but I wouldn't feel tortured if I had to.
B000002KDS|5.0|Every song is a hit on this cd. DEAD BABIES is a protest on child neglect. HALO OF FLIES really show the talent of the band. The band actualy make their instruments sound like swarming flies,amazing.KILLER AND DESPRATADO does what Alice Cooper does best a villian.YEAH,YEAH,YEAH believe me does not sound like the beatles. This song rocks all on it's own I love it, I love all these songs. Honestly every song is a hit. I guess I could say Alice Cooper is a hit man in KILLER. Because this cd is KILLER. But don't take my word on it. Buy it yourself I'm sure you will agree this cd is KILLER AND ALICE COOPER IS INDEED A HIT MAN.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I could not wait to see this movie, but it really fell short for me. I guess that when you try to re-do a classic movie, or a prequel to a classic movie, you're running the risk of falling short of filling some mega sized shoes. It's hard to judge it without bringing in the original, and that's what killed it for me.
B0073COMUW|1.0|this product did nothing but strobe, and it was not as bright as the 60watt equivalent florescent bulb. maybe I'm biased because i received a faulty unit, but after much product review i found that flickering is a big problem with LEDs in general. i will wait a few years until the technology is better
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Possibley my fault, it didn't do what I downloaded it for. On it's own it worked but not in combination with another app.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Loved the scientific background too. If you keep an open mind you can see how it can apply to more than just these little experiments
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun, irritating, FUN,  new game to the Angry bird universe. Occasionally a little to easy, sometimes need more thought than just blasting away. Not fan of the Falcon helper, but still really enjoy the game.
