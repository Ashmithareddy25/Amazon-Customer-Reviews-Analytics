B00CJOL9Y6|2|This jeans is a beautiful dark washed jean with potential for dressing up or down.  I really wish it had fit when i tried it on.  I'm a size 12 so I ordered the 31....this jean barely made it past my knees.  Needless to say, i was disappointed. 2 stars only for colour, simplicity in design, and cut. Can't wear it so no one would see all those great things.  Bummer!!  Oh! i would say it runs about 2 to 3 sizes small unless the one i got was tagged incorrectly.
B005DIIH72|4|These seem to run a little small around the waist.<br /><br />Quality is good. I've only had them for a week but i think they will hold up just fine.
B00125VSNA|5|Ever since I was a young child and first saw God appear on television in the form of MC Hammer, I knew my ultimate destiny: to become the world's best MC Hammer impersonator.<br /><br />Nothing would stop me from achieving this goal - not my creamy white skin tone, nor my inability to dance or keep any kind of rhythm, nor my disproportionate short legs and tall torso, nor my genetically-inherited obesity, nor my suburban mid-western lisp.  These were not barriers.  These were challenges.  And I have made it my life passion to accept these challenges.<br /><br />The quest to find the perfect pair of pants has ended right here.  I bought 31 of these supreme pants and donated the rest of my pants to a paraplegic charity.  Why 31?  Because I have my closet organized by days of the month.<br /><br />I have spent every waking and sleeping and comatose-drug-induced minute in these pants.  I've been trying to get these pants blessed by Saint MC Hammer but his agent threatened me with a restraining order.  The way I see it, just another one of life's challenges...
B000NVWYUK|5|Great hoodie. wish I had bought one the last time. Keeps me just warm enough not too hot, not too cold.
B001B2I2YW|5|He loves his new long sleeves. Alaska here we come!<br />They are so warm, and not too heavy, perfect for under a T-shirt.
B000WTMFZM|4|Well, I haven't had many expandable waist pants.  I've always been trim, but as I get older I appreciate a pair of pants that has some give, especially after a big meal or just sitting down.  My previous experiences have all had waist material that adds a lot of bulk and weight to an otherwise light weight pant.  These are much more reasonable.  As I live in warm climate, I wish these were more of a true &#34;cool&#34; fabric.  They feel more like wool than new-age material, but are still reasonable lightweight and dry fast.  The wool-feel does make them look more dressy than athletic (which can be a good thing if that's what you're looking for.)
B00VEZD6M4|5|This is a wonderful summer frock for life here in Florida!  The fabric feels more like cotton than acrylic and is smooth and cool.  I've been wearing it a few days now and really putting it through the paces in our heat here.  So far the fabric continues to look crisp and cool, and there are little or  no signs of wrinkling. This would pack in a suitcase very well...folds small and is wrinkle resistant.  The smocking on the top is firm enough to provide a little light shaping, but not so firm as to be uncomfortable.  I like the longer length.  It looks nice, and comes to the top of my ankles (I am 5'4&#34;),  The pocket is pretty small, but can still be useful for keys or other small objects (a lipstick, maybe?).  It isn't easy to fit my body shape (I am an &#34;apple&#34;) so I am delighted to have found this cute sun dress at such a reasonable price. I was also pleased that the sizing is accurate.  At last... a really practical and attractive summer dress!
B00DIX5SVM|5|Super cute top, pattern on both the front and the back (I mention this because when I ordered it I was a little concerned that the pattern might only be on the front of the shirt). Fits according to the sizing chart--I'm 5'8&#34;, 145 pounds, and a M is perfect. Not as sheer as you would think--only needs an undershirt if you're wearing a non-skin-toned bra.
B005VGI6H2|5|The shirt fit very well and I can't wait to flaunt it in time for the World Cup. Great buy!
B00G4C2ZXS|3|I ordered a medium for my 12 year old because I had a feeling they ran small and boy did they.  I am sending them all back and not reordering because I'm afraid a large would be too small also.  She normally wears a small in juniors and these are just ridiculously small.  The shirts seem to be a good quality though so that is why I gave it 3 stars.
B001OAMTQI|3|Hi there , i bought those socks a couple moth ago and must say , i wear a size 10 ,so if you wear a 12 it might be to small for you .
B00NOVCMHG|4|I am 5'1&#34; so a little long  - I am a 1x but ordered a 20 and it fits well so it must run a little small.
B004LY57D6|4|Worked okay for us but don't expect much.  I had to sew the &#34;beard&#34; to the &#34;mustache&#34; farther up the mouth because it hung on my 14 years with the mouth opening on his chin.  Otherwise it worked well.  Sheds some.  But again, it was cheap so can't complain.
B00RDSHVUO|1|Fit and look like pajamas
B00THEYG8C|5|Nice!
B000X5NQGW|4|The 10 year old that I purchased this for, was thrilled with the style of this dress. I purchased it for her band concerts this year. Sadly, it is a small 16. She normally wears 14-16 girl's, but this fits her like a size 10 would. I am sad because she loved it until she tried it on. It is beautifully made. Just beware of the sizing.
B00851M3Z6|5|Shaweet
B00ALST002|1|At first look, i thought it was going to be a loose fit which is why i bought it. it was small and doesnt fit the way it shows in the images. i had to give it to someone else
B00J6ASF7U|5|Great shirt, my toddler loves wearing it!
B00F6PAG76|1|My product was damaged. I received it with rips and tears in the seams. And product did not fit like it was described online.
B00574M9AS|4|But it's up to calf ???
B008JS4SGC|5|Excellent~
B00BSC64Y0|4|I have a number of other NYDJ products, and they fit much better than these. I think I will stick with buying what I can try on from this company.
B00MN4RALS|5|Lamb skin exterior leather is very soft and jacket fits well. I wear a large, sleeves have an excellent fit, not baggy and boxy like most Moto jackets. I did get it from Gilt.com for only $289 which is a steal. It's nicer looking in person then in the Amazon picture. I would definitely recommend it, and I have bought and returned 4 leather Moto jackets in the past year, couldn't find the right one until this.
B0058EDI5C|5|Men's Paisley Design Dress Vest NeckTie DARK PURPLE Neck Tie Set size XXL ;  Dam I look sexy in it!
B00P68DUMG|4|Beautiful dress. Cannot wait to wear in two weeks on my wedding day!!!
B00DFYCQY6|5|I love my new nightgown, as expected, since I now have three of them.  Love the fabric, love the vibrant colors (I have Teal, Magenta and also a pale blue)  I do wish they were not quite so &#34;pricey&#34; tho because then I would try to own one in every color!
B004RIKYKW|5|Just what the doctor - or Miracle Max - ordered.  A nice T for any lovers of the Princess Bride.
B00OEYFSQE|2|top was too small
B00NTOZNGA|5|TRUE red - exactly as pictured.  Took a chance it wouldn't be tomato red!  AND it fits.  Thank you.
B000JNP58A|4|This hat served well for 2 different characters! Its made OK and has served its purpose. Not a bad deal either.
B002B919JY|5|5 stars awesome
B00T56BJ5A|3|My wife loves the dress pattern and material but it comes with an undersized belt that only make any tightness in the belly appear worse.  She uses one of her other belts that is wider or wears it without the belt.  The belt loops are not really noticeable but to the wearer it can be a negative.
B0062R7DZ0|4|I sent this to  my sister in Florida and she called to thank me.  Said it makes everyone smile and she has so much fun with this cool T.
B00HYK7IKE|5|The price is amazing for this product! It is a little thinner than I expected in material but bright colors and awesome to where as a shirt, and of course an amazing cover-up for bathing suits or any occasion on the beach.
B0033AYT7O|5|It is our favorite baby bow. It is soft and made from quality materials (some bows look as if they are made from gift wrap materials or something less substantial) Our little Hannah gets lots of compliments.
B00FRI3WXC|5|Awesome
B00M0UXH94|5|love it  i wear it and levis's belt everyday
B003ATPLCK|4|Love the color. Have other pairs and patterns. High quality product. Knew it would be too big, so I ordered accordingly. Turned out great. Suggest the same to others.
B0037E9ZOI|5|Perfect fit and very comfortable
B005XU0VQA|2|Not happy with the way they fit me. Just not a comfortable cut for my build. I've never had this problem with other Dockers shorts.
B009CCRK8C|5|These are a great pair of socks at a fair price. I used them for a trip to Canada where I was outdoors all the time and they stayed comfortable even when they got wet. Definitely would recommend these.
B002EQ95K4|5|This is good quality and sharp. This fits in a front pocket and is very handy for an active guy. My husband is a cowboy he can ride all day with this in a front jeans pocket. He no longer loses his wallet :)
B000OSKR6U|5|Nice sturdy hat! Love it.
B002BTOP1I|4|Great Looking Hat. I can shape it anyway I want. Awesome
B0035QP0EC|1|This is CRAP. You cannot wear these in public. You can barely wear them in the house. I am not a large girl..Im very average sized and I have average sized legs. I bought the medium. They barely fit over my thighs. They are COMPLETELY see-through. You cannot wear these to the gym. The only time I wear them is as shorts underneath a dress. Worthless. I have tons of bootyshorts at home, I didn't need to buy these.
B00DDWA1RY|5|its a great size as it fits for a smaller child but allows room to grow into. It is as beautiful as the picture. Cotton on the front of it though when I was expecting it to be silk.
B0099RUC76|4|A great item my wife loves it.
B00860JJPS|1|These look like they fell out of the Manson family's car on the way from Spahn Movie Ranch to Barker Ranch.  Why would anyone pay this much money for these beat up looking things?  The only thing that is missing are the blood stains.  Puleeeze!
B00TQ7UGNE|4|It's pretty good and the good ones still stay  on my feet after multiple wears. The reason I said the good ones is because 2 pairs already started to slip off after first wash
B00062NFH2|5|Best quality around, they fit perfect and are so very comfortable. I would highly recommend them to anyone who hasn't tried them .
B00FFZ8YXK|5|Warm, soft and very well made. I gave it as a gift and it was very well received A winner! :)
B00J3QHUS2|5|I did a Mario costume for halloween.<br /><br />All I did was buy this, the pants and a red shirt and I was good to go. 5 minutes on amazon &#62; going to a store.<br /><br />I had a few people appoarch me for photos at the bars and everything turned out great.
B00LOKNT5S|4|they fit real good, would order again definitely
B00JSJHQP6|4|Good money clip, strong but cant hild more than 10 or so cards well
B00JA1YRXG|4|This is a great undershirt, but a little too expensive... I bought 8 more, so it tells you how good it is, but I wish it was a little cheaper or a larger quantity offered at a lower price.
B00CKLI6X0|2|Tiny. XXL would fit like this picture shows if you wear a size 0-3 US.
B00B0EA4VA|5|It has tassels on two sides, it has a nice texture with it that's subtle, it is thicker than most scarves out there that I own now, being lower temps it's the greatest thing right now being able to wrap your whole face up with it or wrap it around your neck very snug.
B00OBHOVMG|1|Not true to size.4t fits like a2t
B009N0YI88|3|Fit is good, but they sent the wrong color.
B006KJB72U|2|These run REALLY small.  My T-shirt is a 2XLT, and I bought a 3XL for this.  I'd need a 5X to be comfortable!  Returning.
B00KMPKUGM|2|Although the style and appearence of this Nautica coat are chic, and its  workmanship is also nice, the actual coat filling doesn't match the article description on web. The washing lable on coat states; filing is 100% polyester. I feel I was misled,  it is heavier than same sized down coat.
B00EYCCT22|5|I really love this corset. And I'm glad I bought it. It's so sexy that I got in another color they had.  The fit was perfect I'm a medium so I orderd a large and it was perfect.  Very affordable and worth buying  thank you
B006RJ3NH0|5|A nice product, arrived quickly and exactly as described. The instruction notecard that came with it made it super easy to learn how to tie it. Haven't washed it yet, so I'm not sure about fading our bleeding, but I'll update my review if I find any problems.
B00IMWR4S4|3|It is not true to size
B00NHK01F4|2|I liked the dress. But it fit big. Not really what I expected.
B001GQSK36|5|Very soft and comfortable beanie. It's warm but not too warm. It does have more room than I thought it would on top, but it can be rolled up, or scrunched up to get rid of the head poof on top.
B00F6E9344|5|Amazing top and worth every penny!!! I  a 36DD and it fits like a dream! Excellent support and coverage! Love it!!
B00MEAGSEQ|2|Hate that I had to put the lace in myself. Hardly wear because it's just not that sexy
B00YM1Q0FC|1|Awful, not like the picture at all , poor quality and saggy
B002ATAV1C|4|I bought this for a crazy hat day at school. It was what I expected. The quality is good and the price is reasonable. I would recommend it to others.
B005CW0704|4|Look good fell good. But x-large is more like large though..
B0014JXE9U|3|Sleeves are way too long had to roll them up 3 times. The body fit well and the material is soft.
B007OWEIZK|2|The flannel is hefty, but pills too easily. Mine was covered with pills (lint balls) after the first wash. Watch out what you wash them with or you could be picking lint off your clothes. If you are 5'9&#34; or taller they will be too short unless that is what you want.
B00KX5ORJW|3|Still a cute shirt
B00J3XPONS|4|The shirt fit as expected  Well made. Bright red color.  Looks great on my 5 year old son.<br /><br />VIVA CHILE!!
B00ND0Q0D0|3|It's kind of small
B005CSO4WU|5|Love these shorts.  They are light and easy to wear. Hold up in the wash very well.<br />Nice to wear around the house ot take on vacation.<br />Reasonable price.
B00HNGWHWI|4|I have bought four of these tanks now in preparation for nursing and pumping. I have both mediums and larges and I can get away with both sizes as they are stretchy. The white is a little see through, but other than that I'm happy with them. The black and white combo pack is a great deal! Wish they had combo packs with other colors available too.
B003H10OYQ|4|I was expecting these to be a bit higher but they fit more like a bikini style, at least for me. Also fit a bit on the small side. Otherwise they are fine.
B00M1TIZ1O|5|It fit good. Arrived on time. Looks like a real sweater, but feels like a tee shirt on the skin.
B00800ANOA|5|I like very mucha the shoulder pads.
B00TTD5VMG|5|boyfriend loved this one even more. thanks double!
B00AKSDD9M|5|I have no complaints. Everything was great from order fulfillment to the actual wearing and fit of the shirt. I always look for great deals and this one was one. Of course, I also monitor pricing to determine when to buy.
B00FD7BEQ4|4|Not much to say, it is comfortable and does the job.
B00GOLF716|5|My husband loves his pants. Easy to get on and light enough for summer weather. Thanks!
B005LCMRLM|4|Was happy with quality and price, the size is off, a large fit's more like medium.
B00USB67I0|3|I ordered all three colors in the same size(lg) but only the blue ones fit. The others were too small.
B003WKVH8Y|5|Love the show, love the shirt.
B00AE9PF20|5|Very nice. Wish it held more stuff, but hubby likes it.
B006SVWE22|5|This big is just beautiful! It has a nice plush backing - which will be perfect since I'm not going to have my daughter wear a shirt while smashing up her first birthday cake. And it's a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The front is so pretty and I loved that it had pink & white polka dots on the candle as well as the bottom of the cupcake. This bib is so much nicer than the picture shows. And the price is lower than most 1st birthday bibs I've found in stores.
B001BZ41KS|5|Other reviewers said it was a little bit see through, but my daughter is going to wear an undershirt anyway. I personally didn't find it to transparent. She has been wearing them for the past few weeks, and hasn't fallen apart yet. This shirt seems sturdy enough. I'll be buying again real soon, because I want the other school approved colors.
B00J13DV94|5|Cool shir
B003BEEFN0|4|I love these jeans! They arrived as described and in perfect condition. They are very comfortable and sit a little higher on the waist, but fit very well. On the inside of the waistband, there is a pretty light blue and dark blue flower design and a hidden pocket of the same fabric in the back pocket. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B007BLNH42|4|Looks good and fits well. I haven't washed it yet to know if the fabric holds well or not. But, for the price, it seems to be a good buy.
B003Z05156|2|cheap quality
B005HE1530|5|I was very shocked that these worked. I was nervous about buying these for my daughter. She is a dancer and nothing stays in her hair but this worked. She did adjust it once but that was out of habit. I also gave one to my zumba instructor since she is alway adjusting her headbands. I watched her closely to see if it moved at all. Again nothing, however, she would grab at it to adjust it but it never moved. She did this out of habit from other bands. I will admit wearing it myself that it does feel like its going to move but when I looked in the mirror it was still in place. My other daughter has worn it for basketball and soccer as well. I would highly recommend these. I have since purchased more from sweatybands.com. However, I did the grab bag ones and they were all fine.
B002LVUXYE|4|I found the fleece to be thinner and less insulating than I expected. My old one is much thicker. I work in a dairy cooler,and this one does not keep me warm enough.
B00YP1XHBO|5|For the price and the fit I'm giving it 5 stars.  Fabric feels like cotton not that fake costume material. It can easily be dressed up or down. I'm 5'4 120lbs. Bought a small. Fits perfectly
B00AZH6UBQ|5|excellent!!!!
B003L1N8SQ|3|This is extremely convenient and handy for my most important credit cards. Fast shipment and I would highly recommend this. I will purchase additional ones as gifts for friends and family. Screw comes undone fairly easily and that makesit fall apart...
B0030BG7DK|5|I received the trunks on time.  The trunks are comfortable to wear.  It has pockets that are useful.  It can be worn as shorts.
B0036UTCOQ|5|Looks very good and fits me very well. Warning to summer wearers or residents of the tropics, it does keep your noggin warm!
B00OZGHJYA|4|The item came in a timely manner. The color was exactly as expected but it did fit small.  I am a muscular built 5'7 and the large fit snug.
B00TP14OKM|5|I bought either the large or x-large and it was a bit baggy on me but that's okay, I love the shirt non the less! Probably going to wear it to Pride one day.
B00PB042K8|5|Love foxcroft shirts!!!  Fit great, wear and wash well.  Received many compliments looking trendy!!  Price was a good discount from website
B0073CYH02|5|Love shopping on line and received just what I was hoping for.
B008PEK170|5|The product is very good, the material of this jeans are better than other expensive jeans i have purchase in the past.
B00DXD8PO4|5|I own these in two colors. Super cute and fit well!
B00G4G2N7W|5|Socks arrived promptly.  My wife loves them.  They fit perfectly on her size 6 feet.  Goldilocks material.  Not too thick, not too thin, Just Right!
B00MFWEEG2|5|This product was a total STEAL! If you think this is expensive it's cheap once you see how great these boots are! They fit perfectly and shipping was quick! It came with total protection and no damage done to package. I got these 5 months ago and they still look brand new!
B005CPT8Q0|5|got this as a Christmas gift to my mother. the robe is very soft, very warm, and every comfortable. She loves it!
B00RW16A0O|4|It's a wonder this type of belt took so long to become popular.  I don't know too many folks that don't vary slightly in their waist size as they go through life.  Having incremental adjustments for the belt length is perfect.
B005180T48|5|These are INCREDIBLY warm and comfortable! I feel impervious to the cold now!<br /><br />To give you an idea for sizing, I'm 5'7'' and around 190-200#. I typically wear a 14-16 in jeans. I must have short legs however because my inseam is only 29-30&#34;. I went with the 16 x 30 and these fit perfectly! They're snug for warmth but I can bend over and touch my toes and move around freely. I think that they make them bigger with the idea in mind that you'll be wearing clothes underneath, so I would choose what your most comfortable jean size is. The pants are just a smidge long on me but I think that with boots it's not an issue at all.<br /><br />They're a nice color, I like them better than the lighter brown because I think they'll hide dirt better. I got these for $89.99 + free shipping and they were worth every penny.<br /><br />The only flaw that I see is that the suspenders are kind of loose but I really don't really care about that.<br /><br />If you want some warm, protective gear- GET THESE!
B00NQ74H1W|3|I ordered according to my size on the sizing chart but when I put it on, it was too large. I'd should've ordered a size smaller
B00H9AMK7U|5|Nothing worse that a pair of jeans that are too short in the waist or legs to look AND feel good.  I love these jeans.
B00WGOFF8K|1|XXL fits like a mens medium!
B001AIXRVK|5|I RATED A 5 STAR BECAUSE I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AS SOON I SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME  I REALLY LOVE THIS HEADPIECE-TIARA SO AS THE MATRON OF HONOR I WOULD RECOMMEND THE TIARA TO ANY BRIDESMAIDS OR MAID OF HONOR-MATRON OF HONOR, PROMS,OR 15TH BIRTHDAY AND FOR BEAUTY PAGEANTS!!!!!!<br /><br />THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH; IT'S SO PERFECT FOR THIS WEDDING<br /><br />MRS. DIANNE CLEVELAND MATRON OF HONOR & WEDDING PLANNER
B008HTJBXS|3|was a little Small for an extra large they could make them a little bigger or else change the sizing matrixs
B00J5BF816|5|Great fit...very flattering!  My husband loved it, ha.  The material is very soft and flowing (not clingy) and the V-neck is not too revealing.  My only slight disappointment is that I would not call the color sky blue, but more periwinkle.  Still, very pretty.
B00B5VUV66|4|The band runs big but the cup runs a bit small.  When I first bought it I had just finished nursing and i was popping out of the cup a little but after a couple of months it fits perfect now. it holds the girls up high and I find it's my go to bra when i want to feel really pretty.
B003XXXD8C|5|Ordered this for my daughter and it's really nice. Lightweight and the color was true to advertising. Very soft material on the inside. She loved it.
B00DQEUBWO|5|This is now one of my favorite shirts. It is cute and even looks better than pictured, and super comfortable and light.
B005MJX2LS|5|Cocalo Harper pillows are really well made and are truly made to last for many many years. The pillows could be used from infancy into adulthood. They are true to that deep blue and crisp white color. The stitching is well hidden and the fiber is plush. If you are looking to add accents or a collection that looks like you spent well into the hundreds for an infant, this collection including the pillows are really it.
B00P0E36HA|5|This is a great little tutu looks just like the pic full and lots of layers. Makes me feel very girly and pretty got it in the fuchsia lovely color will be buying in a different color maybe a black I like to play dress up or ware it under my dress to give it that extra flair .
B00F4O2UA0|5|I am 32 weeks pregnant and I bought this robe to pack in my hospital maternity bag. I was not looking for something expensive or high end but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this robe. It was very soft to the feel, lightweight but not flimsy and in general very well made. I also appreciated the fact that the belt is sewn onto the robe so there is no need to worry about losing it. I purchased the robe in &#34;Doeskin&#34; which turned out to be a creamish/ tan in color which was what I was looking for. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to others.
B009YG92K0|5|These scrubs are perfect. I am a woman but I like these bottoms and tops that are for the guys better than the female carhartt--you can't find the ladies ripstop anymore. The ripstop is tough and the colors and fit to me are unisex. I wear a small top and medium bottom--a small bottom would probably be adequate b/c I have to cinch up the waist a lot. You won't go wrong with these scrubs.
B002W8IEII|4|I bought this to use on my team for an upcoming run (Foam Fest). The shirt itself isn't bad, just a bit rough-feeling. It's pretty clear that it's not officially licensed, given that the tag was torn off and an \\"official logo\\" was pretty much stamped or ironed-on onto the tag location, but other than that I have no complaints. You should probably look elsewhere though.
B000MXB52M|2|The straps are too short & make this impossible to wear. I will donate it as new to a local closet for DV shelter & perhaps it will find a comfortable fit. Disappointed.
B005LCMR4E|4|The only problem I have with the shirt is it bleed out on some of my other clothes after being washed a few times.  Other than that it is a nice shirt.
B00KW3JSC6|3|Nice coat but too small
B00BSC64W2|5|The color is vivid.  They stretch just the right amount and they hold in the things in that one wants held in.  They are tailored enough for my &#34;business casual&#34; work environment.
B004RSZACY|5|Loved it. Fit perfectly!!
B00A34UD7S|5|Perfect replacement for slips under dresses.  They no longer cling ... and also I don't have to worry too much if my dress is short... peace of mind to a new mommy.
B0090UX2YC|5|Knife pouch works great. I carry a small folding knife at work & this holds it perfectly.
B00H4SN9O0|5|Since it runs on the large side, it's best to buy one size down. That said, the dress is very flattering and has a very unique embroidery that doesn't show on the screen. Pretty dress.
B001HMN1I8|5|This cape is great.  Nice quality material, not too heavy in weight, nice stiff collar, elastic tie cord around the neck.  Bought for a 6'1&#34; male.  Was the perfect length - a few inches off the ground.  I would recommend this cape, especially for the good price.
B005GTZXF2|3|The clothing set was perfect for my daughter. Its seem too tie on her I should get the other 7 up...for long wear...
B006Z8FW4A|4|Finally found a burnout tee that is baggy and stretched out. Sizing is true to fit and super soft.
B00G4CSJE2|5|Lovely packaging hat met level and hopes of expectations. Would recommend purchasing from this supplier again! Quality of hat was perfect.
B0085J7ITE|5|So I bought this wig and it came in about a week ago and I was bit dissapointed seeing as It wasn't long enough for a cosplay I was working on, but it is Short enough to work as a Kanaya Cosplay, with a bit of tweaking here and there it turned out amazing! The quality of the wig is really great, especially for the price, it fits well and doesnt overheat (as someone previously stated), Super awesome wig and very fun to work it, planning on buying another one
B00TZ6DW46|4|They are beautiful but too large for me so I gave them to my daughter in law
B00N0TCQDC|5|No problems. Fit as expected, nice color. Still good after a wash.
B002093JXO|5|Fits perfectly. Recommend washing the area after removal.
B0050AFX9S|5|Nice neutral colors which I like sometimes. The fit was right and they felt good against my skin.
B004U0IRGU|3|Just got these gloves.  I can tell the wiring is extremely thin in the gloves.  Only 1/2\\" of the tip of each finger and thumb lights up.  Not 2\\" or 3\\" of white like the picture.  The size is SMALL.  I wear an XL glove and if the material wasn't so thin (cheap) the gloves wouldn't fit me at all.  Not sure how long they will last when I wear them and start moving my fingers a lot.  But they were cheap so if I like the effect, I can buy a better quality glove next time.
B00E955EPS|4|EXCELLENT AND ALL OPERATING, GREETINGS FROM VENEZUELA
B000PY9ZIY|5|I have used compression tank tops for about 1year gone through a couple about this price. This thing is amazing!!! I look at least 20-25lbs slimmer no hips no loose gut I am fairly over weight and this is no skinny shirt but it does slim down quiet a bit. It is very tight!
B007F2O4G2|5|These are fantastic. I have a ton of CK boxer briefs, including the stuff in this same material (modal), and these are absolutely superior. The CK stuff is comfortable, but they ride up frequently. These, however, are longer and a bit tighter on the thighs--they barely ride up at all. The fly is a bit silly, but it's unobtrusive. They've only gone through a couple washes, but I'm confident they'll continue to perform well. The worst thing about these is the price, but if you try a pair you'll be hooked.
B0039VP6EC|4|It didn't arrive on time, unfortunately the package was stolen, but the seller was gracious enough to send a replacement and it got to me just in time for Christmas. So yes I would buy from this seller again.  Thank you.
B00DO2ATAW|5|This is a great jacket. Just what I wanted and at a good price.
B007R7S3S0|4|After bending it a bit.
B002UUIIM0|5|I've used these for months. My daughter trained in them and now refuses to use anything else. They do a good job of absorbing the pee. We've even had full accidents where the trainer gets completely wet and it still doesn't drip all over. They wash well, are durable and will be used for a second child. Sizing was spot on for us. Prices/prime seems to fluxuate a lot on Amazon so I suggest double checking the Potty Patty web site before buying here.
B008O2V87A|3|I was I between sizes with this jacket due to in part I couldn't determine if I wanted to wear it open for style or closed for function. It was a tight fit to leave open, but cute. Shoulders and sleeves were way to big and long when ordered larger size for function. Material was awesome!
B00JH1526A|5|I love this dress!! We needed a pretty dress for a daddy/daughter dance & I showed this dress to my 4 year old.  My daughter picked out this color from the other choices. It really is a beautiful dress!!
B0031U0NKS|1|The label on the cellophane package I got said it was a Carhart women's cotton web belt and inside was a 2\\" wide black leather belt!  I don't know who is to blame-Carhart or Amazon-but I got the wrong belt!  It was supposed to be a birthday present, and my daughter was sorely disappointed.
B00MW2Q8JG|4|love this dress
B003JH8THC|2|The hair itself is rather thin but my real complaint is that the skull cap portion is way too small. I actually lost it in a parade this weekend and it wasn't even windy.
B005MR33KA|5|Quickly shipped and an awesome hat :D I needed it for a costume and it will be perfect! Great color too.
B00LX4J3FK|5|I love these pants. I ordered a size bigger so it's pretty long but perfect cuz my daughter got allot of use this winter and more to come into next year.
B00EOPMZ6Y|2|Pretty dress, but runs very small.  I am a 1x and it fit like a large.
B009PK8JZE|4|I love the style of the jacket but it just doesn't fit right. I used the &#34;US&#34; sizing (which made me feel ginormous) but still not quite right. I'm 5'7 and find that the cute button shown on the models shoulder/neck area falls right around my chest. Also, the sleeves are a bit short. Best for petite people.
B00J7U27AA|5|beautiful well manufactured !!!!
B003P2VHTS|5|I love this bra!  It fits well, it looks great, it's held up SO well through the wash, and it's very comfortable.  Finally a nursing bra that makes you feel great in more ways than one!
B009SDU20S|1|There was stones falling off when I took it out of the plastic bag,
B0010VXCJO|4|It actually stays up and gives me a natural look while providing support and minimizing...amazing! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the underwires dig in under my arms, which gets pretty uncomfortable after a while and when I take it off those areas are red and irritated. I still love it though and am getting another one in black!
B00NRBENHA|4|I bought this shirt as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend but I ended up giving it to him early because I was worried about how it would fit and looks.(let's be honest, it can go either way on amazon) . when I got it out of the package, it did not look as good as it did on the picture but when he put it on, it looked real nice. It fits true to size. my bf is over 6 feet tall and the sleeves hit just about right at the arm so I am worried about a little shrinkage in that area. The shirt is very new so I don't really know the life it but it's nice for the price.
B00IKQXRI8|5|Grandson loves it.
B005MRDJF4|4|Great value
B004H0HFM0|4|Was reading all the great reviews and decided to pick this up for the wife for a specific outfit. Wound up being too small, so sending it for an exchange. Bumping up the size by 2&#34;.<br />Otherwise I think many of the reviews are spot on. It appears well made and fits good on smaller breast women.
B00JY3QJ7C|5|Great
B00AX4PACG|5|Love love love this Jacket!!! It fit a lil big but that fine with me!!! Definitely has room to grow!!! My son looked great in the whole suit! Would live to post a pic but it not an option! Great buy!!!!
B009MMFBD8|5|Love these jeans!
B0012GOATI|5|wore it for years! extremely comfortable
B0012NEZ8M|4|Nice tee, I bought it in the yellow, color is very nice. Although, not as \\"thick\\" as I thought it would be. Shipped on time.
B00FBQPDNC|4|Nice material and good color
B00EKQSCAA|4|This dress is lovely and very comfortable. It was a bit long on me, I am 5'3&#34;. The color is as pictured.
B003RBYKA0|2|Does NOT fit true to size! I ordered a size larger than I normally get, and it's way too small. Very cute, but disappointed that my Valentine's Day was less sexy
B00CO97HZQ|5|My wife wears these for doing zumba and spinning. Love they look on her and she feels comfertable with them.
B00S4KZZ26|3|I was disappointed with size.
B0009MZTLY|5|Great comfort and fit. I bought one pair of the dress socks to try them out after I had bought the Thorlo running socks. Liked them so much, I bought six more pair.
B008OQTR24|2|It took a lot of confidence for me to even try this on. When I did, the support in the top is nonexistent and it was baggy even with me getting the smallest size, destroying what few curves I have with my athletic build. I would suggest something else.
B00KB3TQ3I|4|I really like this coat. It is made well, looks expensive and is exactly the length I wanted. However, with all that said, if I hadn't read the previous comments made by past customers, I would have been really disappointed. I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 115. I had to order a large. And I have just enough room to wear a sweater under this coat. Needless to say, this coat runs very small.
B00NIN0QGO|3|Got lots of compliments though!!
B001FOR2CY|2|nice belt but if you have a bit of a muffin top it'll give you a pretty bad rash,
B000BB7W4U|3|needed a cheap windbreaker/rain coat substitute. It did the job. Did not fit well at all (huge in general, arms a bit short). Would not be happy with this in really bad weather, but it handles drizzly weather and the mist of waterfalls/river rapids fine.
B00K5T40IY|5|cool for summer
B001GECBY2|1|Came 2 day after Halloween was the first problem.  And it is NOTHING like the picture, it was self adhesive, not string around head, and it had only a few hairs did not even look like a beard. We purchased one at local party store.
B00BUMLW3G|5|Even though the dress arrived (on time) a slightly different shade of blue it is still great.  It's just so perfect for what I need to wear it to.  I wanted something lady like. This dress is it.  It is very comfy.  It's classy.  I just love it! :o)  FYI ladies-if your arms are very toned like mine the muscle sleeves on this dress shows them off beautifully!
B00N0U3G3K|5|These capris are the best fit for me.  I have ordered 3 pair at different times and all fit as expected.  They are of good quality.  I have them in every color!
B00HYMON82|3|This was not a boys' size medium. It was a men's medium. Ordered it for my 10 year old son. Way too big. My husband liked it so we kept it.
B0037WYFYK|4|I would order a smaller size.  I am a large but the small works for me.  It's a good product.
B00E1JO9VC|5|Awesome
B004IUCHKE|5|I agreed to order the Black Civil War Cavalry Western Style Cowboy Hat because my husband and children loves to play Cowboys and Indians.  I figured this would be the perfect addition, to make their playtime more adventurous.  I was right! The hat fit my husband perfectly.  I was worried the hat would fall off my husband's head, while horsing around with children.  To my surprise it didn't.  As you can see in the picture I attended,  the inside of the hat has elastic.  The elastic allowed for a snug fit, it also allowed my 11 year old son to fit the hat with a snug fit as well.  I must also mention, I love how the top of the hat is hard and the sides are pretty stiff.  This meant the world to me because I don't have to worry about the hat folding up easily.  I received the Black Civil War Cavalry Western Style Cowboy Hat complimentary in return for my honest and unbiased opinion.
B003RRXWXU|1|I have purchased these shirts in the past and been very happy with them. The last batch of 4 shirts I purchased are garbage. They shrank, they do not have the elasticity of the previous ones, and overall the fabric is of a lower quality. After spending $300 for 4 embroidered work shirts, therefore making them non returnable, I'm pretty peeved.
B000ID89TS|4|10 month old son was about 19 1/2 lbs, 27 inches at Halloween - fit perfectly. Not too snug on him. If he was any bigger, it might have been too small.
B00DLK1K0K|3|the dress smells really bad. not sure if I am going to keep it. dont know if I wash it by hand that the smell will come out.
B00LPTWQEI|1|I dislike these jeans.  They run huge !!  HUGE !!<br />I do not care for the prints and holes.  Very, very not True Religion style.  I was very disappointed with these jeans.  Returned them.
B00HNCJDII|5|I just had to have me an N7 shirt. The material is lighter than a Mountain shirt, and the logo is an emblem, but it is really nice. Also, there is no tag in the back, good. Fits fine (it did shrink some) and looks great!
B0056JRLWK|5|Dress is lovely! I ordered it for a special event, and even though it is not considered &#34;elegant&#34; nor very formal, I chose it regardless. I think it makes for a youthful and delicate look. For me, the size I ordered was just right, considering I am 5'5 (so the skirt hit right above the knee) and have wide hips (bottom was not tight; was comfortably loose). The only problem for me is having a small bust, so the top of the dress was a bit TOO roomy. But either wear a push-up or simply pin it from the back (which I did), and it will be just fine. Other than that, I am glad I picked it! :D
B00I5SXU3S|5|Loved it
B00NB9312Q|5|I needed to get a 4X for my size, I have to lose some weight but need to anyway  it's so soft can't weight to wear it!!
B0000C6HR5|2|not good..
B00HXCD3LQ|5|Love it :)
B004RECI2S|4|These panties pretty well do what they are intended to do - stay put, don't show as much as &#34;regular&#34; panties do.  They are certainly nothing fancy, but I like them - especially the way clothing glides over them.  When I sit, my jeans don't grab and pull them down! :-)
B00C0JO7LC|4|A casual jack.. Its what it says it is. Fashionable and Waterproof Outercoat.
B0042UBFB2|4|I bought this as a lark for New  Year's. I wasn't expecting much but it really surprised me. Well made for a novelty. It was just too small. I could work with it but my big head needs something larger. If nothing else I can always keep it around to take drunken pictures in every December 31st.
B00IFXSV3W|5|These are very comfortable and I ordered another pair in a different color.
B003NVKOYK|5|I have a very picky and rather mono chromatic husband.  He needs a casual slack that stays crisp and wrinkle free for work.<br />These slacks are truly wrinkle free and light enough for Florida office work.  I have washed them and come out of the dryer<br />perfect.  These are a winner.  Have two pair light khaki now looking for a gray pair to complement<br />his mono chromatic wardrobe.  Need Gray! Worth the price!
B00R5L8J6Y|5|great price.  color great seashore look.  love the separate bra back.  good tummy concealment. nice length for a taller person
B00MNQ9PEQ|5|I was very happy with everything. The shirt was great and it I did not have to wait to long for it.<br /><br />Very happy with the entire experience,<br />Thank You, Mal
B0045LY1NW|3|After one washing, one of the socks had a hole in the toe, but they are warm.
B00D4397K4|5|I had never tried these jeans before and was pleasantly surprised to find they fit and felt perfect. This great fit is hard to find in jeans which made them worth it.
B008G7LXWS|2|I have been buying Carharts for my husband for years, and they unforunately have cut back on the lining in this &#34;thermal Lined&#34; sweatshirt. The others are nice and heavy, which is why I bought him this. When we got it, you could tell they had cut back on the material used to make it (it felt like a regular sweatshirt), ended up sending it back.
B002WECH2Q|5|gotta love the TMNT! the hat was original design to our area so the boys loved that nobody else had hats like theirs. affordable and reasonable price for good quality item.
B00NUDQSHS|5|Nice prints. They are a great size. Perfect for your favorite gentleman.
B005P20HRE|5|I love it, looks great ans sexy, it doesnt offer any breast support but i dont have a problem in that area thou, im 205 pounds and 5'8 tall and it fits perfectly, would defenetly recomend it
B00DZI2E30|5|Arrived much faster than I expected, really nice  quality! Fits perfect under dress and gives it just the right amount of bounce and flow.
B0076ZZ0N4|5|I pretty much never write reviews but I had to for this dress.  This dress is AMAZING!!!<br /><br />I'm going to be in a wedding in the fall.  I HATE clothes shopping because nothing ever fits just right for me.  Too big in the waist but too small in the chest.  Too long in the torso or too short.  I'm a 46DD and a 22/24 and only 5'4&#34;.  I knew I'd need to start the hunt for a dress that met the requirements (&#34;black dress, long, something you can wear a belt with&#34;) sooner than later.<br /><br />I looked everywhere for a black formal dress - I hit up all the usual plus size stores and bridal stores, Torrid, Lane Bryant, Dress Barn, David's Bridal, etc.  No one had anything that fit all the requirements.  Even though I never buy clothes online because of how hard it is to find clothes that fit right, I figured I'd give Amazon a try just to see what was out there.<br /><br />I read the reviews and decided to go ahead and order the 4X.  It came super quick from the seller and after I took it out of the box, I just had to try it on right away.  It fits in all the right ways - the ruching hides the gut, the v-neck/sweetheart neckline accents the chest, the drape sleeves hide some of the flab on the arms and the shape of the skirt helps to tone down a large behind.  The lining is a bit of obnoxious - definitely have to tug on it to make sure it's completely smooth/flat under in both the front and the back because it doesn't seem to be attached to the outer layer of the dress but that's not hard to do.  I'll have to have it altered to shorten the skirt - it's definitely too long, but it fits everywhere else.<br /><br />I'm in love with this dress and I can't wait for the wedding just to show it off!
B00NQAONQ8|2|I like the sweater but this is not red. This is more of a rust color and now I still have to look for a solid red sweater.
B0047ZYDVQ|5|More than just a good value. The set is well made. Everything was as described and better than I had hoped for.
B00BEQZ99Q|5|Love these.
B00M29V4OI|5|I LOVE THIS DRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's too cute and my 5 year old loves it and loves to wear t to school. Very happy with it.
B001PIGKJQ|5|They are the perfect Ladies Butt Enhancing Panties, but you will need to order a few sizes larger.  The seller was kind enough to give me a larger size and it arrived on time for me to wear under my dress for my sisters wedding.  Love them.  Very fast service and when you email the seller, they respond very promptly.
B00LBNWTO0|5|On so cute!  I bought two of the same style, the other with Eiffel towers, mais oui!  Both accommodate shoulder length hair but even longer would be OK, as there is enough space in the back.  The sweat band got me through my surgical tech practical without dripping on my sterile field!
B00OOMTW7M|5|bought it for my daughter, she loves it and so do I
B00IB6O6G4|5|I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.
B004WO3F4I|2|Works good and looks good, but the strap broke in less than a month other than that it's been fine.
B00I6CR75K|5|Bought this for my husband and he loved it.  The fit was great and the color of the shirt was exactly as pictured.
B00B30X6QQ|4|These are great to avoid panty lines when wearing thin pants/jeggings. I still can't wear them with leggings but my sister has a pair and she can pull it off. My only complaint is that I got a size S and they are very big in the behind area so if I want to wear them with low-cut jeans they are too big.
B009YQYDPE|5|Daughter loved it and wears it often. Very flattering design.
B00ZGBUNGO|5|Great quality!
B00JM52DUE|5|Best baby shower gift!
B003OQTW0Q|4|This are my favorite jeans to wear. I really hope that carhatt keeps making the 1889 series. Very well made and last a long time. They fit very well just below the waist.
B00PZL27AU|1|Really? Not even the same color and the sleeves are not black but blue. Th slit is not that high. There are a lot of loose thread. This is an ugly ugly dress cheaply made in China! Beware don't buy! Ugly ugly dress!
B00E5RTPAA|1|I am so sorry to say about this Shirt, one of the most disappointed purchase I ever done in my life.  I have been in the Amazon customer for more than 5 years but never go cheated like this.  I don’t want to return this stuff because it is too much hassle for me because I am working on board ship.  So I just considered as lost the money.  The material is really not good at all it is not even work of 5 dollar table cloth.  Any way I lost the money that is all.  Please be careful when you order such cloths in the Amazon, however Amazon is always helpful and the best online purchase that we can trust but what can I say this made me really disappointed.
B0081O9QNY|2|I have several pair of 505s.  These definitely aren't the same quality.  Elaborate pocket embroidery and flimsy material were suspect coming out of the package, but I decided to wash and wear them.  They were fine for about an hour,then became stretched and baggy.  I can't return them but wont buy Levis again online.
B001IW0LE4|5|My daughter loves these boots.  Her favorite part is the fringe on the sides...Very Nice!
B00CZ80SIE|4|I love the pants but my son ordered them a little small.  They are true to fit.  Made to last and love the color.
B00QT7J4FK|5|it fits nicely- was just like photo- very happy will wear to Teslacon 2015
B00EDZAKIA|5|perfect for my 4yr old grand daughter. Wash by hand; delicate tutu.
B005ILK7D6|5|nice..looks great on juliet x metal xx...will definitely buy a second pair in the future!!! awesome color combination, as described!!
B003LZFHN6|4|My husband likes the way they fit and we have not had them long enough to see how well they wear.
B003PCOGJ6|5|LOVE!
B001L0O5FO|5|These are the best fitting jeans I have ever owned.  It makes being curvy a good thing.
B003UW2AL2|5|I purchased this for my 2 1/2 yo grandson and he loves it! He loves the Mickey Mouse clubhouse design. When I first put them on him, he wasn't real sure what was on his feet (he has been wearing cooler \\"no feet\\" PJs all summer and fall), but he got used to it after a few minutes. Tends to run a little small so I got him a size larger than normal and it fit him great! Overall a great product and I expect it will hold up well through the winter!
B008YSNHWS|4|LOVE this button down shirt! Too cute!! I ordered the 6-9 mos. The pants are a bit wide for my 6.5 month old crawler. He is 17lbs and 10 oz. 42nd percentile so for larger babies it would be perfect. Also, the vest is fairly bulky and oversized too. But, I'd rather them be a tad bit too big then too snug. He will grow into them. I found this to be the case with all of the Calvin Klein outfits I ordered. The vest is super shiny. It would have looked better with a duller, flat black vest. But overall a great outfit.
B00H4GDAW8|5|I wear this frequently and get compliments every single time.
B0064SE7GA|5|Super quality.
B007KFZGHA|5|Best sportsbra I've ever owned EVER.
B007XDPET4|5|These are awesome work gloves. They give you excellent grip on a variety of surfaces: glaciers, lava flows, steel- you name it. They are very flexible as well, which helps with the grip, and they are comfortable under a variety of conditions: handing out topside on a boat in the North Atlantic, in heavy winds and cold temperatures, in lava tubes, and again on the glacier. I bought these for a trip to Iceland and I am super happy with these gloves.
B0041EA2Y0|4|I wanted to purchase suspenders for my 3-year-old to wear on Easter, but I was on a tight budged. I found these and, though I didn't initially want elastic, I figured they'd have a better chance of fitting. They fit very well and look much more expensive than they were! I am very happy with them and now, almost a year later, they still fit after being let out a bit.
B004D2H9GE|5|I'm a plus size woman and didn't have that high of hopes for this product fitting me comfortably. Let me tell you I couldn't have been more surprised. I also wear a size 12 shoe so the 9-11 made me a little wary. These stockings fit so well and stay up throughout the day without me having to readjust them. I wish I had ordered more pairs than just the one I did because they are probably the most comfortable stockings I have.
B00E3YDZ0Q|5|This was on my fiancé's wish list so I got it as a Christmas present.  He's very happy with it.
B00V85EB3S|4|The shirt fits true to size. I really like the graphic design, but it is off-center. Also, the shirt itself is cheap (low quality) material - definitely NOT worth paying $24.99 or the $28.00 &#34;list price.&#34; Thankfully I got it on sale for half price on May 4th (Star Wars Day).
B00LF9KOJC|4|But love it's 100% cotton.
B002C068J8|4|I gave it to my son-in-law who was very excited to receive this great cap. Great product and quality service.
B00GTVZ0A4|5|Jacket fits great and is super warm
B003GB3796|4|My 11 yr old daughter loves betty boop. She really loves the image on the bag and it's a good size for her to take stuff to her friends house. The only thing she doesn't like about it is the strong vinyl smell. Otherwise, I am happy about the purchase.
B00E0L2210|1|This is so ugly, the material is super cheap and the logs is super think. It looks cute in pics but it's not!
B00DQO0JAS|2|It fit as expected, i followed other reviews and purchased a size larger than i usually wear and it fit great. The coat pictured is a heavy and thick traditional wool coat, in the description the seller says it is \\"thicker than the picture\\" that is the opposite, it is a polyester wool blend and is very thin, the inner liner is thin and the outer material has a shiny cheap look and the seams were loose inside the pockets. If you like wool coats or need a heavy coat this probably isn't the coat for you, if you like the look and don't really need the heaviness of a wool coat then you would probably like it. The seller is very eager to please their customers and if you have any questions or concerns they are quick to reply, i will probably buy from the seller again, i just didn't like the coat.
B00CAVYO3G|4|This suit keeps me modest!! Which is exactly what I was looking for. All except the tush! I'm a mother of 4, so I needed something that I could feel comfortable in. It fit great except on the bottom. It kept crawling and rising and showing too much cheek!!
B00AARKQCA|4|super comfortable! my only complaint is that these flare out a little more than I would like, and they are a little long for me.
B0085TI4C4|1|Like the pants but way too long 32x32 was more like 32x36. Wanted to replace but no luck with smaller size
B00KV63KX2|3|Love this skirt but it has two things that prevent me from wearing it.  #1 it is too short. Im 5' 3 and it has to sit very low on my hips to cover my ankles . I truly wish it was longer. #2 it is see through I mean completely sheer. I have to find a slip to go under the skirt because I tried to wear leggings and it just looked weird. If the shirt had more layers it would be a five star but it was only 7$ so im not that mad.
B007WA05E2|3|Good quality top, nice fabric. Good length.. but the zipper on the front of the shirt makes the shirt look not as flattering. The zipper doesn't even zip..... The shirt would get 5 stars if it weren't for the cheap zipper.
B00H87LZUM|5|Great
B00A152BSI|5|Great suit
B000WAKLLQ|5|When I walk in from work I jump right into these and the match pants. Love them. Do yourself a favor and get a spare pare.
B003VVUQA4|3|Bought this for my husband, ordered the average length (he's 5'11&#34;) - legs are about 3 inches too long.  He deals with it as he really needed it.  word of warning though, don't wait too long if you need to relieve your bladder, takes a minute or two to unbutton.
B00HHL58M0|4|Ordered bigger size to be safe. Not small chested but fits me just fine 
B0039PKP94|5|This skirt feels so great on and makes you look hot! The \\"fold over top\\" can be left as-is and doubles as a tummy holder. Very flattering!!!
B0009HN7Z4|5|About 30 years ago, I bought two pairs of Olga underpants.  I still have them.  The lace is intact.  The crotch on one finally disintegrated but I still wear them when I work outside.  I hope this new version lasts half as long.  The quality seems a bit less than the old ones, but nothing is of the quality as the old products.  We will see.
B00AFJ0MGS|5|I ordered two pairs of these boots, one as a Christmas gift for a friend and one for myself. We had both been looking for some boots just like this in gray. When my order arrived, only one pair was delivered. I was naturally upset, but contacted the company and I have never been so impressed with a company correcting an issue that may not have even been their fault. We don't know if it was the delivery service or the company, but the company is making things right.<br />They are reimbursing me for the missing boots AND replacing them at no charge! They don't have a huge selection yet, but I will be watching for more to come! Their prices are great and their boots are of great quality. Thank you Mr. Goldberg and the rest of your team. Mr. Goldberg even contacted me by phone to ensure that the product he was sending was the correct one. Thanks again!<br />Angela
B00DEX5MO4|5|I love this coat. It's really warm without being too bulky. The partly wool lining keeps me toasty.<br />Lots of pockets and a hood.
B002AU1UWA|2|Bought these pants for my boyfriend, they were 2 inches longer than what was ordered. The label says W34 L30, but the length was actually 32. I purchased a similar pair of dockers pants, W34 L30, from a store close to where I live and they fit perfectly.
B0081ICI26|3|First off, i have no idea how tall the model is, but she must be a migit because there is no way this necklace could hit an adult woman mid abdomen on.  it is too short.  i wanted a sparkly long lariat to wear with all black tunics that had some bling to it, this is not it.  i'm keeping it because it can be used with a vneck, but its just ok.  i might give it to my niece.  it was cheap and it looks sort of cheap.
B00FDMIM32|5|This is a lovely scarf in bright, cheerful colors. It adds real &#34;pop&#34; to any outfit. It is made well and washes well. I would buy from this seller again.
B00CM7JQJA|2|Didn't fit my son, too small. Maybe okay for really slim kids. The quality was good and they looked fine for the price.
B00HQCMZNA|3|Just received it, fit well but it is to small (large)<br />but it has good price :v
B00JBHDDFC|5|Perfect! My 5 year old loves it!
B004WJ2JNG|5|This is an easy-entry, easy on-off, onesie style shirt.  By putting snaps on the side, Disney eliminated the need to pull the onesie over the baby's head - especially difficult to do with a newborn!  There are only a few of these style  onesies available, but they are 100% better than pull on.  The cotton is a nicer weight than most onesies, and has kept its shape and size after washing and drying.
B00NGPT28C|5|Very beautiful men's tie
B00P0ABHWU|5|Ordered 5am Friday morning and received Monday, I'll give 5 stars just on the shipping... My sons like to wear these items under their cloths to avoid the big bulky jackets. Thanks again, I'll be backhand yes I'll recommend this to all.
B00NIN998U|5|I never go wrong with CK.....THE BEST!!!
B00MC4KJ08|4|its nice
B00337RZ82|1|It's a nice wallet they sent, BUT IT'S THE WRONG ONE! They sent a trifold wallet instead of a bifold, which my father hates. Yay -_-....
B00CWZAD44|5|I'm completely in love with this dress! I am bummed though... I bought it then lost a bunch of weight so now it's too big. The sizing does run a bit small, and if you have big boobs then you will want to size up. But for the price, this is a fabulous dress! It is well constructed, heavy material (nice quality), and trimmed nicely. Longer than I expected, which in my 5'8&#34; case is a good thing.
B001B1FDH2|4|This jacket is pretty close to the one I had for a few years that I loved. The zipper broke and this is pretty close. Nice product.
B00K61OJPU|5|Fits great. I'm 132lbs. 5&#34;5. It's more comfortable then expected and u fell hella sexy. Lots of fun to spice things up in the bedroom. Bf loves it 😉
B004M40RCQ|5|the bra was shipped quickly and beautifully gift wrapped. I am very happy with this purchase
B00F3BMV7Q|5|These little earrings are just adorable! Cute for a little girl and for big girls too.  ;)<br />Very decent quality for the price- enameled metal. Great for any girl who loves cats and tiny things in general. I'm getting another pair so I can wear 2 cats or fishies at once.  &#60;3
B001G7R0JU|4|The belt is durable and works fine. But it's wide enough so that it does not fit smoothly through the belt loops on Dockers pants. Threading the belt through the loops takes more time. If you use the same belt for multiple pairs of pants, you'll gradually fray the belt loops. Consider having a separate belt for each pair of pants.
B00G28G1QG|1|Not even close what is on the picture , colors are different from whats shown , its actually brown and pink , wouldn't recommend to anyone !
B00EC61V10|5|Hoodiesky is fast responsive and does quality work.<br />I thought that I might not get it in time and so I<br />ordered another one from a different vendor<br />and Hoodiesky's  quality and speed blew the other<br />vendor out of the water.  Going to send the other<br />vendor's crappy one back.
B00DQZ2ZDQ|4|Nice dress. Fits well. Was concerned that it might be a tad tight around the hips but there was some give. Fabric was rather thick. Hand washed it even though it says dry clean only.
B00HIILK8S|5|Very Nice coat. I thought it would be more like a jacket but it is very thick, warm, and soft!
B00QWOT2AM|4|Daughter loves the shirt.  Shirt is a little thin but overall great value for a lightening deal.
B00R75VRH6|4|Awesome I love it. But the tail is bit too long
B008YU8VKE|1|I returned the black sweater and a pink sweater I brought a month ago only to get them back in the mail today I wasted $16.87 on postage in addition to the spin torn seam sweater
B00385Y5NW|3|quite a bit bigger than I  thought it would be. Definitely not for a newborn! Maybe a 3-4 month old would fit into it?
B002KKVS40|4|I love how my daughter looks in her Halloween costume!
B003X26SEE|4|it fits for ours
B00MHOYLH0|4|Beautiful dress.
B00EDO9D2K|5|Great Quality Husband loved it!
B00ILS3XK2|4|Very comfortable. Perfect for jogging, yoga, and going to the gym. Only issue (maybe?) is the pockets are a little too small.
B0108VLDEW|5|I was afraid it would run small but i would have been safe ordering my actual size. Very cute and bright! Can't wait to wear it to the music festival next weekend!
B00JD1GIGM|5|It is one of the best belts I have ever owned. It has lasted me a while, and the holes have not stretched out nor has the belt began ripping or tearing. Great product, worth the money.
B00DTSOBQ4|1|I ordered this necklace for my cosplay as Eren and not only did it come late, but it came bent up. when I lightly tried to bend it back, it snapped completely in half. Cheaply made. would not recommend.
B00372SV7W|5|The best socks!  I was looking for my husband's favorite gold toe socks at the local clothing store and to my surprise they were much inferior and expensive.  That was when I decided to check out amazon and these socks are comfy, thick, and well made.
B00A9ME76C|5|Perfect fit!  Looked great at the 80s Prom party
B00N3YIHXC|4|It's very cute and fun to wear, it is cut on the small side though, I ordered an extra large and I felt like I should have gone for xxlarge or for the male sizes, since I like hoodies to be baggie. It wasn't too small but it was smaller then I expected and the arms are a bit short which is something to keep in mind. Also, I didn't notice it at first in the image but the tail is on the inside, not the outside so it's a little odd to sit on. But over all, I do like it and so long as you keep these things in mind you should look into getting one to =)
B000K10U4A|5|Gave as a gift with RAVE reviews!! It's beautiful, hand-painted silk.  In my opinion, looks like a very chic, expensive scarf.  The recipient has worn in out in the evening over a black dress, which looks gorgeous, and by day to dress up jeans and a jacket, which also looks very classy.  A well- worthwhile purchase!
B00L6KXAQY|5|I liked it.
B008QNQYV2|4|I love the beanie but, the picture depicts that it is more slouch than the beanie actually is. However, I have compromised and I love wearing :)
B00REG8CQ2|5|Everything ok!
B00MLVSTC2|5|The pajamas arrived in a timely manner and our daughter was thrilled with them.
B00HANKB36|5|Its incredibly well made and well thought out with respect to design characteristics......its the best present we gave this x-mass season.<br />We can't conceive of it being better than it is.
B004VQWW28|4|a little smaller than I expected but our son loves it
B00JE8XQZ0|5|Very comfortable.
B008AQCWB6|3|I had bought a medium from carhartt store but it was tight fit so I went with large and it floats on me.
B00JLQ3VIW|3|I bought the black suit with the cherries in size 12, and it fit PERFECTLY... However this style fits slightly more snug and is less stretchy.<br /><br />I looked at the tag and there's a slight difference in the fabric, so that might be why. I'll be returning this one to get a bigger size.
B00PXVTZWU|5|Great rain jacket for kids!
B000VZRSLS|5|I brought these for my son. Was a bit unsure if they would fit him..he is 6'6'' and a welder. Its hard to fined pant and equipment that fits him right. He loved them. Great fit
B008A0RK28|5|These lenses look great in my husband's frames.  They went in very easily and we did not have any problems.
B009MUZ7FW|4|In this day and age of internet purchases, it is really nice to buy something and see that the person sending it doesn't think of you as a number. My ego doesn't need stroking but the lovely note included with the purchase (while photocopied) clearly showed that the seller appreciated the sale. It is lovely to connect with someone from the other side of the world. Item as described and my daughter is delighted with it. Good price too. Thank you.
B001KO2QA2|4|I love the tunic length - can wear it with some leggings and boots (could almost wear it as a dress - I'm 5'2\\"). It's light-weight cotton, so a turtleneck in winter or camisole at other times is needed underneath. Got the red one - bright and beautiful, with detail on both sides.
B003WJZDQW|5|I love the prayer shawl! Good quality! I highly recommend getting one!
B000AO59MU|3|I bought these for my Halloween costume, they are super cute, but the top of them are really really tight, I'm an average size girl, 5'5&#34; and 125lbs but I can't wear them cause they hurt
B00FF9QYJW|5|This hat was a Huge hit for my 6 year old grandson's train party...GREAT QUALITY...it left no doubt who the Birthday Boy was!!!
B00B182O2M|5|I ordered this bra because of the back coverage. It does wonders for my bustline as well. Puts the girls exactly where they should be without flattening them. Back coverage is wonderful no back spillage even in snug sweaters. No show through when one gets a chill either. Will be ordering this style again.
B009IUM6DC|5|Its really cute.  My friend that I bought it for wears it quite often.  I think she really likes it
B00JVY26HQ|3|Its a nice dress. But alittle snug
B008IHM0XW|5|NICE!!
B00IW3KJ8U|5|it's not perfect but for the price and the jazzy style it's awesome!  It's lightweight and stretchable but still hangs like a dress, not a bodysuit.  The color and style is attractive.  I think it will be very easy to dance in, but still dressy enough for New Year's.  Pleased!
B00KG2PVJC|5|i love it
B00ELPZQL8|5|What a Perfect Shirt and Hat, to celebrate my husband's 70th birthday. Very soft feeling. Perfect fit!!!!!!!
B005INFY2I|3|I was really excited when I ordered this coat but when I received it and tried it on it looked old-ladyish.  Back it went.
B00DOLERHE|5|I should have bought these a few months ago. These are really comfortable underwear that cover my belly and don't roll down (very often). I am 5'6&#34; and 230 pounds at 9 months pregnant; I bought the XL size. I've been using these for a couple of months. They are quite stretchy and I could have used them even earlier than 7 months. I am not bothered by the white dots like some other reviewers.
B003R9EESA|5|can't wait to put it on my gf.
B0023UK7GC|4|It was such a low price I did not have high hopes that it would be 'great' ...but I was surprized . The wallet is well made and has all the room I need. The only thing I did not like was the plastic insert that protects the credit cards. Only 3 cards can be inserted and the 'lever' that slides side to side is very flimsey and will probably not last very long.  Still, for less than 5.00 it ok if I use it until I can afford to buy a better one.
B00B2HV7XY|5|very good product I like very much worth having several of these models in different colors Greetings from Venezuela
B00BGY40RI|5|Beautiful gown-much prettier than the picture demonstrates.
B00ZK8T5JO|5|Great fit and great fabric. Comfortable,looks good, feels good, and I can wear it all day long outloors at the beach or pool.  Great color selection, too.
B003M1J3KC|5|Lots of fun
B00PWGA0DY|5|it fit wee was pleased
B00IRH7IYE|5|Stays on my feet.
B00VS3Y36U|5|Nice fit in medium. Colors did not run when washed. Great for workout tanks.
B00SQ3IY6U|5|Love the vest
B0007VFAOS|2|I bought this pancho to wear to a '60s party and then chose to wear another one.  However, this is an attractive sheer look for a summer get-together or to wear over a bathing suit.  It was a good value.
B003IBLTT4|5|good job
B004WKVUC6|4|These stayed on all night and were pretty comfortable to wear. I customized them for the incisors.
B008ESD5MK|5|My feet are always cold. I live in New York where it seems we only have 2 full months of nice weather. So I saw these slippers in a casual passing. So I ordered them. They fit perfectly. They are incredibly soft! If they don't keep my feet warm this winter- nothing will! :)
B00ESXF3GQ|2|I did not care for these pants. They were huge in the waist, and too short in the length.
B00JXZ55VC|4|I normally wear XS or S. Ordered the S sized blazer, coral. Fit is ok, a little on the baggy side in the front. Color is gorgeous. I gave it 4 stars because the fabric is not that pretty, definitely not what i expected. However, the overall look is attractive, so I'm pleased with the purchase.
B006ZKVJJK|3|Nice but stars would have gone up if the dress had been lined. Just feels cheap. Ran a little big but belt helped a little. Added a petticoat and a vintage pea coat and it did the trick.
B003HIC0AA|3|3 stars cuz I love when I wore it the first couple of times, but then it ripped off. I picked my size according to their size chart. the funny thing is I bought it again and it ripped after the second time I wore it. unfortunately, I have to find another brand for pantyhose.
B005E0CSY2|4|Good quality hat but the M/L size is too small for my regular sized adult head. I bought it as an option for an adult Mario Bros costume but I would not recommend it for that. Again, good quality hat for the price, just not the size/look I was looking for
B00174JC3Y|4|little tight in the ankel.  The design is great!
B00SBHDVYG|5|Love it .Perfect length,bright colors.Looks and feels like summer.Iam5'6&#34;and weight 146 and lg. fits perfect.
B005PTQV7M|1|This was awful. It's tiny little ping pong paddles with a tiny net and a tiny table. I thought this would be regular sized that I could put on any regular table, but it's not.
B000N8RVU6|5|My son needed new work pants and I went with Dickies, they're super durable and they fit great. These shipped quickly and he was quite happy to get a new pair of work pants. Great Pants at a great price!
B00BJDLWAO|5|I LOVE this top. It is a great fit. Super comfortable, super soft.  Looks very professional.  I have a long torso and long arms and this top has great legth in both areas. The picture is pretty tru to form.  The green color is gorgeous. I bought the Large and it fits perfect.  Im 5'9&#34;, 36C and the Large really works. Hope this helps when deciding your size.
B00THMEZIK|4|The dress was nice,good quality and shipped promptly.Only minor complaint was the cost of expedited shipping $18 on such a small,lightweight item.
B003D00TWI|1|items would not stay on and was a waist of money..really ruined the whole theme for my Halloween party.....very disap
B00SQAZ2EA|5|Best bra I've ever tried!!!
B00LDVVRCA|5|Cute shirt
B008EKZMOW|1|Belt broke within a week of using it.
B003ESZQZY|5|Awesome seller and great to deal with. This wallet is excellent and my daughter loves it!
B00AJ9G12I|5|Fits well. Very comfortable. Beautiful color.
B00EAXEZP4|1|They were all beautiful colors I bought around 7, however after dressing with them in the street people will stop you to mention that your skirt is sheer clear I see your underwear. The quality was so cheap. Even with the darker coolers I have the same issues. I was actually excited to wear my skirts for the summer.  Well I didn't wear one. Too much of an embarrassement. Mind you I pay money to get that kind of service.
B008596LFQ|2|run large...I have to let my mom fix it before I can wear.
B009DNWH2O|3|I'm a pretty average size woman, and these are like putting on a second skin.  Once I have them on, I like them.  They are comfortable and flexible, but they are a little see through.  Still, overall I like them well enough.
B00OK0XE5Y|5|Love love love!!
B007FCF1XM|5|I love it I have it on right now and its my first time with a corset and I love how it feels I love how it makes my body look I think its perfect
B00A6II0BC|5|I bought these handkerchiefs for my aunt. I am sure she will enjoy using them. They are quite dainty and cute.
B0045MDG2I|3|These are fine for my use as briefs under biking shorts, wetsuit, and running shorts, though the seams are a little more prominent than pair of sports briefs by Asics that I purchased at the same time, so I wear the asics in preference to these. I'm not a huge fan of the bold logo/advertising on the front, either.  But on the whole, these perform well.
B00HJOMEPY|2|These just didn't work:  too short, length-wise; a little too tight; funky waistband; not the best material.  Can't recommend them.
B00LY436FM|5|Very cute!!!
B006P4NEZ8|4|The reason I bought these mittens was because of all the positive reviews it got. People said they finally found mittens which fit their baby's hands and which wouldn't fall off. In my case I had preemie twins and these mittens were much too big for them and kept falling off. The gerber mittens seem a better fit for them. Have washed them several times now and they have held up well with no fading in color or tearing. Very essential product to have especially for winter babies. My girl's hands are forever cold and these keep them nice and toasty.  Also put the mittens on the babies' hands first and then dress them up in the pajamas . This way the elastic wrist cuffs of the pjs hold the mittens in place all day long without a hassle.
B000FXSUT0|5|love the double fronts!
B000UK4TUM|5|Very satisfied with the skirt and the fast delivery! I love the length and light material. The slit in the back allows me to move quickly.
B00FFYN5PS|5|LUV IT
B00B93TYU4|2|This dress is extremely small. Also, when I sent in a return request, I discovered that it had to be returned to Asia, at my expense!!  When I ordered it, I had no idea that it even came from Asia, or I would have not have ordered it.
B0030DFCT8|1|The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers. Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband. Shirt wouldn't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN!
B001EH9OWI|1|length shrank by at least 7 inches in cold wash. waste of money
B00FI6CNHE|5|so cool!
B00EAH1WTW|5|I bought this hat for my wife. She wears a XS, they only have Small and up. It fits a little big but I can fix that. Its a very beautiful and elegant hat.
B000IBNCO2|3|While they do keep my feet as warm as tube socks in snow boots (minus keeping the wind and wet off), my toes are aching at +5 degrees, and nights are dipping to -5, so I'm finding I still need to add enough external heat to keep the aching cold and calf-muscle cramping, defeating the purpose of buying -40 (and previously, -35 of another brand) socks.  These are noticeably better than the previous pair of -35 degree socks I first bought from another company, and I do like that I got two pairs of J.B. Field's socks for the price of one pair of the other brand.  Of course, if I'm exercising or doing physical labor, my feet are toasty (unless they were cold before I started, then it's always hard to get them warm again without being in truly warm indoors, or propping my feet in front of a space-heater.<br /><br />I purchased these to keep my feet warm without needing to apply external heat while I sat or slept through the morning hours in places and circumstances without fireplaces or electricity.  They are going to save me money in the long run, since I don't need to apply heat if the temperature's in the +10s or above, but they aren't doing what I bought them for for temps down to -20.  In the event we get down to -30, again, I wouldn't really expect -40 socks to actually keep my toes warm, let alone, down to -40, without some scientifically engineered materials, not wool and plastics, but I did expect these socks to work at least to -10.  And I will also add the final bit that I am wearing a wool-based sock lining with these, so even with an added wool layer, I'm still not getting warm feet just above 0 degrees, which is nowhere near -40, right?<br /><br />A heads up: Obviously, if a sock is mainly made of wool, or cotton, and/or polyester/rayon, it's going to be thicker the lower the temperature rating it's for, so no one should be surprised these are, indeed, thick.  How thick?  I had to remove my insole cushions so my socked feet had room, and they are thick enough, as well, to provide the otherwise missing cushion. :)  Make sure you have extra toe-room in the footwear you intend to use them with, before trying to wear these socks in them, and you'll be fine if the temperatures stay above 0, and you will need to burn calories for temps below that, unless you have hot feet naturally, which I don't.
B002K6F7BO|4|I am a full 34 D and I pop out of the size XL. It is made of soft material and comfortable but I think the sizing is small for nursing ladies.
B002EI23AG|5|The jacket arrived as promised and was a perfect item for the rainy day that follwoed the day after it's arrival. Will do business with Charles River again.
B00D3R4Z9Y|4|Cute and soft.  Other colors would be nice.
B00B280WGG|4|Well made and effective !
B005GYGEXM|4|loves them
B00GHY1QB0|5|Great belt does not come apart at the seams where other do it's got stiching there to keep it together great leather belt great design love it!!
B006SRTDPW|4|kind of big in the middle but keeps u warm.
B00CONNGVQ|4|Fit just as I expected it too! And I love it. I wear it almost everyday for as long as possible
B00JUM090U|5|SOFT AND COMFORTABLE
B00717F00U|5|good stuff, but I was hoping the matching halter top would become available, but it hasn't. Very disappointing. What do you do with just the bottoms? Might work OK in Europe.
B00N21DGXM|5|I read that they ran small so I ordered a size up and was worried till they got here. They fit perfect!!!! yay!!!!
B00OPEA2W8|5|This dress is stunning!!!! The pictures serve it no justice. The bottom is a chiffon like material, in a deep blush pink with sequined design. The design is a dark silver with a few gold accents. The top is black, fits well, not too low cut and the sleeves are cut well, almost like a longer cap sleeve. This dress sweeps the floor and I'm 5'10&#34;. Elegant and just classic, worth every penny. This designer never fails.
B00P1Z88QM|5|Loved it so much, I ordered two more (different designs).  Received many compliments when I wore it to a party.
B004185E8U|5|I already have this bra is blue, red, &amp; white I will be ordering another fits perfect.
B00HSR4LS0|5|I had looked in department stores for Ferragamo wallets & was shocked to find that the price was approximately $500, so ordered this.  It came on  time & is exactly what I wanted.  It is a basic wallet with a change purse & billfold, with room for about 6 credit cards.  Because the price was so good, I wondered if it was a fake, but it is clearly genuine.  Very good quality leather and Ferragamo markings.  My son suggested that it may be discounted online because it is last year's model, but that is fine with me.  How much can a wallet change from one year to the next - not much.  Color also very attractive.
B00E8OV97M|2|Runs small and very itchy.
B00Q5NB6Z4|5|Awesome comfortable shirt! I love it fits great, the material is great (:
B00ME149K0|5|So pretty!
B00OUVOB96|5|Real nice top! I get compliments on it every time I wear it.
B000AN1TWK|5|Oh, wow.  These pants are so great.  They're nice and heavy, (indicating quality), and there are nice little details. To help others with ordering -- I am about 5'4\\", and I usually wear a 7/8 in pants.  I like low-waisted pants that give me room and don't squeeze my belly.  So I did as others suggested and ordered super small --- I ordered size XS, and they are a great fit for me, and still a bit roomy, but I like them that way.  I would definitely buy another pair of these!
B0085IC6EC|1|This was a bad buy. The quality was really bad. I regrent this buy. I think amazon should not sell this things
B009GWF8DW|2|This vest has a horrible odor.  I have had it hanging outside on the porch for a week trying to get the stink out of it.  Not sure what the smell might be - sort sort of chemical processing.  This vest is generously sized - and you should order your normal size or smaller.  Most vests are sized smaller than normal sizing.
B00CH5TLJ2|4|It's taken me a while to find a bathrobe like this. Could only be better if I made it myself so it could be a little longer.
B00HIKVPMW|5|The dress is perfect! I do wished it was a bit longer about 2 to 3 inches below the knees.
B001H0FKDE|3|I have extra small hands as in I wear extra small lab gloves, the kind that teenagers would wear. No one else in my lab actually has hands as small as me.<br /><br />Therefore, when I read the other reviews that said these gloves were loose, I was a little worried that these gloves would be too big on me. The reviewers even mentioned that they had long thin slender fingers. I figured if it was loose on them, it might be crazy loose on me. Well, these gloves were definitely not loose. They were super tight.<br /><br />I think this may be designed for people with long thin fingers, which are elegant. My hands are by no means chubby and plump. They are just short and regular thickness.  I think if you have similar hands as mine or similar width-- at least-- you would find these gloves to be tight.<br /><br />Other than that, the color looks just as pictured. I would say it is an off-white creamy color.<br /><br />---- Update 23-March-2013<br /><br />Okay, I am updating my reviewing. I just dropped a star.  These are REALLY tight.  I don't know if this is my imagination, but they seem to be shrinking not widening to my hands over time.  Perhaps, it is not that.  Perhaps it is just the fact that it is getting so darn cold around here.<br /><br />When I put my hands into these, they seem to attract the cold.  I didn't understand how this was possible when other reviewers said this. I mean, I figured these are cloth.  They, at worst, should only be able to warm the hands a little--right?  Well, I was wrong.  These gloves really do attract coldness.  On close inspection, I see why.  There are little air holes in the gloves all throughout. I guess this was a design feature by the manufacturer to make it more stylish and also to allow ventilation. It would make sense to wear these gloves in warm weather then.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is still wintery now. The weather and the material of these gloves are really not suited for really cold weather. You may want to try cashmere gloves. I think next time I will buy cashmere for this purpose.

B00FZF7MU6|2|Please, how do I send it back?  There was no packing slip for me to send it back.  Please, I need your help.  By the way, I truly love wearing carhartt pants.
B008HRXVYU|5|Thiswas just what I wanted!!! The best price was here. Thanks for making it a better Halloween!!!!!!!!!!! Will be back!
B000FGYV90|5|It's a good baseball cap but I ordered it by mistake I wanted the fuller bike looking one,  This one fits snug which is a baseball cap.  My mistake.
B0099ZPYGW|5|Pay CLOSE attention to the sizing suggestions.  I am 5' 7&#34;, 162 lbs and have a slight upper build.  I ordered a US XL and it fits SNUG.  Gonna have to watch the holiday pounds or this jacket will probably be too snug to wear.  Otherwise, a nice product.
B003DKP9AA|4|For those who are familiar with products from TheTieBar, their bowties are nice, thick, full, and keep their shape well.  They don't fray and live up to every expectation.  Surely this isn't the most formal pink bowtie out there, but it looks good for the intentions I have for it.  My only problem is that I don't often feel like wearing pink, which doesn't go with too many colors.  That's a mere matter of preference, of course.<br /><br />The paisley pattern is exactly as shown in the picture.  I would have preferred a higher level of complexity and more texture, but it's a good thing I didn't have those as part of my expectations.<br /><br />All in all, no surprises.  You know exactly what you're getting.
B00D6AKYES|5|After reading the other reviews I was wondering about this peacoat...the color is stunning and the fit is perfect. I ordered the size 4 and love it...
B005CJMGCE|2|My order was for two different colors of this style pants.  The dark pebble fit as I expected; snug like my preshrunk Levi 501's.  I was very pleased with these.  The british khaki were significantly tighter (way too tight).  I suspect they were restocks that had been improperly laundered.
B00J3B0NY0|5|Pleasantly surprised! Super comfy & cute. Bought for cruise, can wear casual or dress them up.
B000ARG1KG|5|It's super, super cold here in Wisconsin.  These socks are definitely getting the job done of keeping my feet okay.
B00MEI9H9G|4|the bra is runs somewhat small, and on the loosest setting the straps are a bit wide and sometimes fall off my shoulders. However it works great, is very comfortable, and is nice fabric. Great purchase for the price!
B0032842G0|3|Tight... Felt as was cutting me in 2. I'll take that as my own problem though. Btw seems to be made well.
B0018OMSN4|5|Jeans fit as expected. I like the look and I am very please with everything about the 550 relaxed fit jeans.
B0016CF5TC|1|There is no description on this product, what is the material made of, inseam/length of skort
B00L36O7AE|5|Fits as expected, very comfortable and true to color as  shown.
B0026EZULM|5|I gave this as a Christmas gift/stocking stuffer. They loved the bright color. They also loved the idea of being able to use the touch screen on their smart phone while keeping their hands warm at the same time.
B002DGYA50|5|beautiful shade of NAVY BLUE. the material is substantial, as well as &#34;silky soft&#34;.  I have a lot of shawls, this one is softer than the others. The fringe is nicely tied. I'll be wearing this for many years. I like to close shawls with brooches.
B00KBZTA0A|5|excellent!
B007AK1LW4|4|These socks are super cute. I bought them as a gift so I can't say anything about the fit, but the recipient found the socks fun and very soft.  They were also delivered quickly and in an appropriately sized padded envelope.
B00HK00MAQ|5|Love it
B00FRKYY96|4|The eye openings were to small had to cut eye opening seperation to make it one opening . Now it is much more comfortable. It is very warm.
B001O9BELA|5|just as expected.
B00KY0C78O|4|Took forever to get here, but I love it.
B0054OU8CW|4|The material quality is poorer/lighter than that of 18-months.
B000UANV7Y|5|I love them! It actually arrived earlier than expected. Thank you 😘
B00GYEPSLM|5|Lovely....can not wait to wear !
B00F91XR96|4|Bought this before I put on some pregnancy weight and it fit a bit small then. I went up about 3 cup sizes in the end, so it definitely doesn't fit now. The top of the cups hangs low as well, so I couldn't even pretend anymore. They fit a smaller friend of mine perfectly, though, so it made a nice gift for her, even if that wasn't the intention. The make is sturdy and none of the spikes are loose, so it's good craftsmanship, I just wish it had actually fit me.
B00KPWOTVO|5|Really cute, well made, great buy!
B004A7YLPY|4|Quality of the product is good and value for money. I recommend this product.<br />It came with a very nice metal box.
B002HWS45C|5|Very warm and fold up small enough to fit in a coat pocket or purse. Don't try and wear earrings with them though...ouch! Good for those who live in a big city and walk a lot and for running.
B00KM6O6SY|3|I love everything Adidas.<br />Has to have the symbolic 3 stripes .<br />These shorts are the look I was going for, but the quality seems to be a little cheaper than I expected.<br />All in all they'd make for some pretty good summer trunks. Not sure about the longevity. I haven't had an opportunity to give it much use. This is all a presumption based off of the feel.<br /><br />I got these on a daily deal for a great price.<br /> I wouldn't recommend paying over $25-$30 for this item.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Bucky Wilson<br />www.facebook.com/bucky5676
B004ASDPX2|4|Liked the fit, feel, and fun of these workout shorts. Quality seems fine. They definitely heat the body up...!   It would be nice to know more specifics about the product.  I expected to find a tag on the shorts offering....tips and suggestions!  There was no tag...!  I found myself...asking questions about my purchase...like...  how often do I need to wear these...to actually see noticable results.???? ...Can change happen...if I just use them as workout shorts...30 min a day...or do I have to keep them on...under clothes...for most of the day.???  Also.. ..how long does the ...anti cellulite material...stay in the fabric of these shorts????... If I wash out the shorts, after each workout...am I washing out ..this cellulite eating fabric factor!????  (better to know if I only get...30 washing..for $ paid!)  I bought these shorts..as a curiosity...to see if the product would actually make a cosmetic difference ..for the better!!!  So..whether they work or not...you end up ...having a good pair of workout bike shorts!  smile...
B00829SXBE|5|My wife loves this sweater
B0058LTVDS|2|I followed the instructions for sizing based on my measurements and the corset is actually a little big. I can tighten the strings all the way shut. It is too stretchy I guess, and apparently not meant for control, hence the 'faux' which I thought applied to the leather.<br />Otherwise it looks right, and it is pretty comfortable.
B002J0RPFW|5|Featuring a adjustable straps at its side to fit  all sizes. A soft, light weight cotton with beautiful flying colors. A perfect skirt for both casual and formal outings.
B00J8PN762|4|Very nice top a little big though
B00145Y308|5|Wear it on all kinds of jackets and coats. It's a nice pin and people notice it. I really like it.
B00PRHMI8I|2|Very pretty shirt but way too small. I'm sure it would cost more than I paid for it to ship it back.
B00M0NLPYU|5|yes! exactly as I needed and so pretty! perfect for me!
B00U4MW8FO|1|I wear a large for every shirt I wear and this shirt in a large is like a medium that shrank and was skin tight when I put it on. Needless to say I will never be wearing this shirt and hopefully I can return it. Also the dingy white and colors of the people isn't accurate. The shirt is actually very bright and vibrant, too much for my taste. Doesn't deserve even one star.
B00LA3KB8W|3|It's beautifull but I'm medium size and this was way to small and streched so much that the seams broke
B005LLNIIY|2|These claws broke the first day we got them. We had to superglue a few of the claws back in. Which was pretty annoying considering we needed it for a halloween costume.
B003BEEGES|5|I have been desperately looking for jeans that were high waist with stretch and this is exactly what these are. I really love them. The material is soft yet not flimsy so the effect is flattering. Plus you don't feel like you are being 'squeezed' into a pair of jeans as the fit is such that they are very comfortable yet not loose. Jeans from other brands in the same size and specifications can feel really awkward as the cut may be too low (even if they are called high waist) or the fit is too snug and clingy. But these are perfect and very forgiving! I recommend these for anyone who has extra weight on the stomach as the high waist takes care of that without pinching and creating bulges. The jeans fit at your natural waist line and smooth out the stomach (somewhat- not like control underwear or anything) so you are free to wear shorter tops without fear of bulges.    The flare is quite a bit with the boot-cut, more than with other brands - I would have preferred them slightly straighter personally. Also if you are under 5'4 these will be too long so you will need to get them shortened (which for me is worth it).  I still give them a 5 star rating despite these shortcomings as these are the best jeans I have come across since having gained weight.
B00K67UIUO|5|good
B001JBNDL2|4|Comfortable, seem to be well made. Made in El Salvador, better than China. Would have given 5 stars if they were made in the USA
B00ENGRP46|5|This shirt was a gift for my dad and he loved it!!!!
B00J7RKYS0|5|Very nice product . I recommend it for the quality price and amazon delivery time.
B00AJ9G2QS|5|Bought this for a vacation, and it is now my favorite casual dress.  It is long (which is good in my case) and fits perfectly.  It was a bit low-cut, but (depending on the occasion) i just wore a tank top underneath.  The coloring is also very similar to what is shown in the picture, and I liked that the darker stripes were at hip level - very slimming! :)
B00AE8ZT1S|4|Good quality and nice print.  Just as advertised.  This is a thin cotton shirt but it is well made.  Be careful with the size. I take an XL in most tee shirts (46 inch chest) and ordered a size extra large in this shirt.  However, the shirt fits a bit tight.  If you have 46 inches chest I suggest you order an XXL.  Good shirt for the price ... highly recommend.
B00JB8VZKQ|5|Love this top so comfortable
B007TVKCYC|5|The case fits very snuggly over the iPhone 4S. It has a nice feel and is very cute to look at. I have had numerous compliments and many have asked where I bought it. Unfortunately, when I went to buy a couple more they sold out! I have it on my wish list as presents for my friends. I'll think of something else for my enemys.
B00Q5FLB4I|3|For the price I expected more structure.  The material is filmy, which I like, but looks like a rag if not pressed a bit.
B009BR8OMY|5|Love it! It is so lady like and perfect for the beach.
B00USRKJ10|4|Very nice!
B00486QEGG|5|Sexy!  And the material is much better quality than I would have expected.  I'd order again.
B00PCBZIXG|5|Fits great. very comfortable!!
B00HNJU7ZE|5|Really soft and very cute! Fits exactly like I thought it would. Doesn't run too big or too small.
B005J7JULY|5|The shirt was exactly what I expected and fit just right. No shrinkage. Great size on picture too. And The shipment came before the expected delivery date!
B00CMQ9ISK|5|Excellent
B00MTS2R1Q|4|The hoddie was for my daughter, she loves it. Fits great and good quality.
B00KHMFDNA|3|This product doesn't look as good in person as it does in the picture. Looks better quality in the picture. I'm a bit disappointed in this item.
B00JE88EPW|5|Returned.
B00B9CLPDE|5|What a value. These are super comfy And cute. They are a t-shirt weight pant. They wash and wear great. I bought all the other colors that were my size.
B00BYSTIPK|2|Size was too small for me, real tight. Material is ok but not that good quality.
B00GSU7ARM|5|Great value
B005JI1V9W|5|They are comfy and fit well. I'm just used to wearing my clothes a little loose. My best to all involved.
B00247RC1W|4|It's a headband with a halo.  The wires connecting the halo to the headband bend so that it can be stored or mailed flat, so I guess there could be a possibility of those wires breaking if there was a lot of bending and unbending.  For what I got it for, halloween, it worked great and held up exactly as I wanted it to do.
B003R9FRRC|5|Fits great! I wear these with different skirts and dresses and it looks great and is comphy! I have yet to have any &#34;runs&#34; in them, and they've been worn over 10 times easily.
B00WOKK4ZK|5|There's something about this top that I just love! The feel, the look and how I feel wearing it. It has a wonderful little weight ring inside the cowl neck to ensure that it hangs properly. I don't put it in the dryer because of this, but primarily for noise reasons--I think it would fare just fine.
B0027P9Z6G|5|The size was perfect and the glasses didn't move at all on my face. The hat was a nice addition as well.
B008JIXAF2|5|The price was unbelievable....I tried one on like this in David's Bridal and it was $279 dollars....can you believe it??  This one is beautiful and I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day!
B00G9G4R6M|3|I just got these gloves, they fit alright and they're very warm. But the little magnets that are &#34;cleverly hidden in the logo&#34; are very weak, they don't really hold together at all. I don't really see the point of them to be honest. Also, they do work on a touch screen, but not very well. You can't use your phone or tablet the same way you would without gloves. I usually use my thumb when I'm on my phone, but I can't with the gloves on at all. I have to use my pointer, but it only works if I hold my finger on the icon for a few seconds. Granted, I'm still able to use my touchscreen with the gloves on, but I was able to do that with the knit gloves I usually wear. I don't really see what advantage these gloves have over regular gloves except that they're warm. But of course you could probably get warm gloves that aren't made for touch screens for less money. I'm not going to return these because they seem like sturdy gloves that will last a long time.
B0035UFAC0|1|If you think jay leno is funnier than conan obrien, you obviously have no sense of humor.
B00NYXG9C8|5|This has quickly become my favorite!
B003X9F1B8|5|I expected this tshirt to be a bit to long for me when i ordered it. I'm a short person only 4.9&#34; so i had to get this shirt tailored to fit me. I'm happy to have a tshirt  from a band I like. If you're skinny and tall, this shirt will look great on you.
B00ONH318Y|5|Love the jeans with all the holes in them. These Machine Jeans fit so good!!!
B00DXZT1BS|4|Great jacket.  My son is 6yrs old and wears a 6-7.  This jacket fit him nicely with a little growing room left.  My very picky child likes the elastic wrists which this jacket has.  Everyone is happy.
B00AAHBN2M|5|I love the jeans so much I just ordered another pair!!!!the jeans fit perfect and are so comfy. Thank you
B00K8AIBI0|5|Hubby likes them
B00N1V62YS|5|Looks and fits great!
B00GHE79J8|5|Pretty and perfect. Two things though<br />1. Thong isn't measured correctly. Short one end so impossible to put on.<br />2. If you're a size 4 or smaller then it's totally for you. But I warn I'm 5 ft 4 and it touches the bottom of my butt. This robe should be 2 inches longer.<br />That's all. Great product. Washes great and super soft and comfy.
B00WXEQNEI|3|I usually wear a 36B.  This bra fit perfectly around, but the cup size was more like a C.
B00EZ3RLWI|3|My daughter likes them, but I'm somewhat disappointed.  The descriptions says the back has elastic.  They do not have elastic in the back, and my daughter has to wear a belt to keep them up.  The waist seems entirely too large in proportion to the rest of the pants.  Well, she likes them and just wears a belt.
B00F2A9X88|5|I am glad I bought the &#34;medium&#34; as it fits more like a junior size than a women's size.  I am 5 ft. tall and the medium fit me similarly to the model pictured.  It comes down on my hips an inch or two further than on the model.  It is light weight but warm.  Color is accurate on my computer screen.  I have not washed it yet.  I like the color for a change of pace from winter wear.
B005KSZHHI|5|A very thick and solid leather belt. Hope it lasts long.
B001808WLU|5|So nice not to have to worry about a disposable swim diaper with these. Great even under other bathing suits, though you may want to size up for that.
B00AARJEFA|3|I'm about 5'11&#34; and 102 lbs and it fitted okay. Better than some other lab coats I bought. I also got a Grey Anatomy lab coat at the same time and that one fitted very nicely. Skip this one and spend a little more for a better quality lab coat that looks more professional. I highly recommend a Grey Anatomy lab coat. I got so many compliments for that one.<br /><br />This one was just okay. Fabric is thick, little cheap looking. Sleeves were too long for my frame.
B001UQ6SXQ|5|Great fit. Quality materials. My spilled food on himself his first time wearing it and it washed out perfectly.
B00GI3ZP1M|5|Got this as a present for my husband. Looks great, and he says it feels great. Very happy with this purchase.
B00AWD5ENS|5|Excellent design and good quality
B002BTQTEY|4|Darker than the picture made it look but still great.  We wanted a weathered look and that is what we got.
B000ZQ667A|4|need superglue to hold mask and helmet together
B00EDOH124|5|I was very pleased with my purchase.  The bra fit better than any other purchases I have made in the past.
B00729TONQ|1|I am very disappointed. The bows look adorable but the glue is coming off after only one time use. After one month ALL of the bows are seperated from the clip and also the ribbon is peeling of the clip.
B00WFH3ZHG|5|The robe fits well and washes well.
B00KRCGVFE|4|These are nice, quality dress pants for boys.  I took off one star because they ran quite big.
B00JN59LU8|5|Sizing nice. FIt great. I'm 5'7&#34;, 145# and orders a size 10 and fit perfect&#62;
B00AVKBJ5Y|5|love it my hubbys batman:)
B00CWUGYTC|3|I was soooo excited to get these kitty ears, but I was a little bit disappointed when they came. To start off, they were late. It was only by three or four days, but still. Then when I put them on I realized the ears weren't centered. So, I have to slide the headband over a little bit so they look right. This wouldn't usually be a problem, but the wire digging into my head on that side is a little bit uncomfortable. Maybe I'll wear this with wigs, so my head has a little bit of protection from these nasty wires, but other than that it's probably going to just sit on my dresser and collect dust. Oh well, after all they were only like two dollars.
B000KD23B6|5|I got this for my grandfather for Christmas. He worked for union Pacific for 44 years. He loved this shirt.
B003BFL60O|5|These shorts paired with a captains hat are awesome for either a day at the beach, boating or yachting, or if you add a sailor jacket Halloween!
B0091XYU5I|4|These really do work. It just concerns me how snug they are. My baby has long skinny feet and it still turns out these are tight. She is now 6 weeks and they do leave a little red mark.
B00IIK6SD2|5|Purchased this wig for a galaxy themed work party. The wig had more of a shine to it than in the photo (which was great for its purpose).<br />I didn't use the hair net that was included in the package since it was too tight. The wig has some space for when you put your hair up in a bun.
B005GSYHFK|5|I wear pants length is 108 cm, waist circumference, but only 80 cm, very difficult to buy in my country this size jeans.Thanks to Amazon can perfectly provide for my jeans.Approachable prices, excellent quality, I like LEE
B00P0K2BA2|5|This jacket is EXTREMELY warm, actually warmer than I thought it would be! It's quilted inside keeps me warm and I don't feel the element. $55, is a Great price for a jacket this warm.
B00P0CHN1C|5|This is really nice. The material is soft and stretchy. It's more like a sweater than a long sleeve shoften. Usually with shorts like this the sleeves are too long and I can cover my hands with them; not.so with this. It falls just above my wrist.
B00HRZLSYI|4|Wife looks great in it
B00N1884JM|2|Shirt is very well made but it is too loose, while the length is just right. Particularly the sleeves are very very loose. So the proportions are not just right.
B00NLMO122|4|The buckle is much easier to use than the old style military brass buckle with the sliding roller. This configuration snaps closed with teeth that bite into the fabric and hold it in place. The old style buckle depended on a wedge effect where the roller was pulled into closer proximity to the material to lock (wedge) it into a fixed position. Getting the old style loose again required breaking the wedged tension of the roller and was a pain!. This new configuration just pops open and releases the belt. Bada boom - bada bing! The fabric of the belt itself gets three stars, the buckle earned top rating so overall 4 stars. I am well pleased with this purchase and would readily recommend it to anyone interested in a robust item of clothing that will take hard wear and (apparently) last a long time.
B00MXL1OUE|1|Runs small
B000G79KTE|5|I do have a problem with FEDEX, its easier for them to leave a package at the post office now that they have a payment agreement with them.
B004R1I6PY|3|Some of the shirt's its hard to judge size I regularly have to buy the a large long wrangler shirt
B00EONSCKO|5|Wasn't sure what to expect with this blazer...but I was pleasantly surprised :) Turned out to be a great color, with the perfect yellow accents on the collar and sleeve. Material is a little thin, but good for the spring/summer nights. Overall - love the purchase!
B00HQ9LHHI|5|Everything ok!!!
B00128KJA0|5|I have a great deal of trouble finding bras that fit properly due to my large bust (34H) and I have an even harder time finding sports bras that fit.  I am an avid horse rider and hiker, so a good bra is absolutely necessary and I dislike bras with under wires because they often end up creating sores from poking me in the side.  I was very impressed with this sports bra because it does not have under wires, but does not let my girls fall out underneath like so many bras do....also, it keeps the girls in place and I have not had a single problem with them popping out the top or sides.  I can hike all day and still be comfortable in this bra, and the girls stay in place when my horse is trotting......needless to say, after one trail ride with this bra I got on Amazon and ordered a second.  So, if you're a busty girl that's active I would highly recommend this bra.....it's well made and does what a sports bra is supposed to do!  My only slightly negative comment is that the bra does seem to run just a bit small......the first one I ordered was a 34H and it was almost too snug, I can wear it, but I use a band extender on it, when I ordered the second one I ordered a 36H and its a wonderful fit.
B00GH2MVF2|5|Love this!  Nice and thick.
B00GQUTGTO|4|It's a tad but large.. But maybe it's because I'm not a model. Lol, it fits pretty good though. ;)
B00FDUUE1W|4|Purchased these for additional warmth/coverage while plowing snow during night hours.  I selected them oversize to wear over my regular jeans and shirts.  Economical solution over the $100 insulated units.
B009LLSW2W|5|When you first try these on they are smaller than expected but do a stretch out after a few wears.
B008A1JJK8|5|Very foos
B005VTEYLG|5|Great product
B001JE1QU4|5|Liked this visor very much!!!  Easy to close in back with velcro and a nice shape to the front. (At least for me.  In florida I wear visors all the time and each visor is is a bit different)  I ordered a few of these and they were all great! .  One has to find the shape that works best with ones hair and face.  (women)  Men probably should also note that visors are all made differently.  Like baseball caps.  Look in the mirror and see what you like and what is comfy of course.  This Visor has a great shape and nice colors. Good value !!
B0040Z64KG|5|LOVE this design.  It was actually very different than all of the other plain Batman shirts out there.  Fit as expected adn got here on time.  Was perfect.
B005OFLSWK|5|Great product and great service, thank you!
B001HCUFLE|5|Exactly what the title says, you get what you see. Item came in perfect condition and shipped quickly. No issues and we are going to get some good use out of this headband. Good buy!
B000HTIMBS|4|The leg openings on these jeans are really small compared to my other Levis of the same cut...any smaller, and they wouldnt fit over my boots
B004XG21B8|5|We like the option of extra large size, difficult to find in retail stores.
B00LT79QVC|5|great
B0046MFR8S|3|Duplicate Review in Prints<br /><br />I have read with interest all reviews here and honestly believe I have a little more with the product than most. I have ordered these in both solid and prints several times over the last few years. Once from Mystic/Alexander Del Rossi directly, and another three times through Amazon. The buyer that experienced \\"blow-outs\\" in side seams is correct. The problem is worse with solids than prints as THEY ARE CUT DIFFERENTLY!! Cannot explain why that is the case. The solids I have received DO however have hanging loops inside waist, a nice feature. The prints I have received do no have the same feature. Both DO have the problem of side seam blow-outs; but prints much less so. These are GREAT buys when they run sales and they are $1.99 to $3.99 each (happened last year or late 2010).<br /><br />They are cut strangely. Years ago (2005 and earlier), I wore satin boxers from OF ALL PLACES a major chain headquartered in Bentonville, Ark (maybe that won't be censored). These are NO LONGER AVAILABLE anywhere that I can find. Adjusting for inflation, those were similarly priced. They were cut normally (for Americans at least). In them I bought XLs and still wear what few I have left. Yes they still FIT!! In these I order 3XL. Those had one MAJOR difference, they were 10% SPANDEX!! They were much softer and would stretch or slide inside jeans, unlined wool or cotton slacks. These do not which is the source of some of the side seam blow-outs.<br /><br />If vendor reads this, please explore providing something more along the lines of what is described above. I believe they will sell much better. I will certainly buy them and this purchase I bought 5 solids and 10 prints.<br /><br />5/8/12<br />Updating my review, I have now received this order and can state that the solids now seem to be cut from the same pattern as prints (no longer have hanging straps; but that is no big deal). Additionally, the fabric is now smoother and slicker which shouldmake side seam blow-outs less likely.
B000W3DCD2|3|I just got this for my birthday, and I'm somewhat disappointed. The fit is nothing like the picture shows, and the color is completely off. I'm 5'0 and 160 lbs, and I bought a medium thinking it would be slightly fitted. This hangs on me as if it was an extra large. It's not grey like is shown, more of a light brown/dirty beige color. Also, the \\"collar\\" part looks nothing like the picture when it is on.<br />I like it, because it was a gift from my fiance, and because it's comfortable, but it's completely different from how it should have looked.
B004M6UDF0|4|I was looking for a light front pocket type wallet and this one works nicely. I had another one with a steel money clip and only one card slot, but I needed just a bit more space. This one clips nicely with a couple of bills, but not so well with more than a few. The magnet, while easy to manipulate, just isn't strong enough if you've got a wad of bills. I briefly considered trying to mod it with a rare earth magnet, but quickly realized that probably wouldn't be so good for the credit/atm card... Anyway, for me it works fine as is with the small amount of cash I usually carry. The rest of the wallet is built well and has enough card slots to fit everything I need.
B006MKSUM2|5|They were a Perfect Fit. A bit long but after a tuck under the pants they were awesome. I love Amazon
B00GRKADH2|4|Dress was delivered quickly and as beautiful as I had hoped. Unfortunately it was too big for my daughter. We reordered in an extra small and could not be happier with it!
B00JLOO06Q|5|It is a great, hard to find comfort.
B008FMS8K4|5|I was really excited to get such a deal on mud pie. I hope it fits my daughter when Christmas roles around.
B00JUA21OE|5|Pretty, & not too short. Office &/or mid-age mom appropriate. I think my 15 yr old wouldn't be caught dead in it, although out if her price range anyway.
B00DEH87YW|4|Love the fabric. It seemed a little weird and &#34;polyester&#34; when I first opened the package, but after one wash they softened. I now love the fabric. It is thick and soft but doesn't make me sweat at night next to my high body temp husband. My only complaint is that the sizing is a little...off. It might partially be my body type, but the pants are high waisted (and I prefer to wear them below my waistline) and the shirt is really drapey. Not a problem, just isn't quite what I would normally choose.
B00J641DHA|5|I like my linen shorts to fit a little long and not snug! These shorts are perfect. Sturdy, stylish and light weight. Great product and a pretty good price too!
B002NSM3X4|5|Great hat.  My date had lots of fun wearing it.
B00HZ5HSA8|4|I think this hat is even cuter in person than it is in the pictures. I bought it to wear while gardening, but now I'm hoping I have other excuses to wear it. The hat I received looks lighter than the one in the pictures.  Drawbacks are there is a crease down the middle from shipping, but I think I can get that out as it's not too noticeable.  Also, it took a long time to arrive - about 6 weeks. However, I think it is a good deal for the price.
B006CC5N34|3|I love this bra.  It is so comfortable.  I would recomend it to anyone.  Very supporting as well.  GREAT BRA!
B0006I6V54|4|these socks were nice been wearing ever since I got them thanks
B00J8AH3G2|5|This scarf is so soft. It's not for cold weather as it is thin but it's absolutely beautiful.
B00I0W9FV0|5|I usually wear a s. Sm but after reading reviews I ordered a med and it fits to a t!  It is fitted in All the right places. I love it!!
B00XVCGK3K|5|The hat is slightly snug, yes but I have a huge head so that's probably not going to be an issue for most people! The hat will come folded up several times inside a small, sealed bag and it will look creased and weird when you first take it out of the packaging, but all you need to do is let it set overnight or so and that will begin to go away. The more you wear it the more it continues to &#34;unfold&#34; the creases. It's a really cute hat, it shields my eyes and face from the sun but it's not a huge hat. It's a good mid sized sunhat. Disclaimer: I received at a discount in exchange for honest review. My opinions are my own and I was not compensated for sharing them.
B00NC3WFN2|2|I really thought it would have had fur on it,to make it look 3D..also it is not a sweatshirt.
B00S8N6DY8|5|Amazing price n quality
B000BTD6YC|4|For a smaller size...it ran a little large i would have kept it and did the wash and dry to shrink but the shirt was made of a quality and it was pre shrunk so i sent it back to get a smaller size.
B007E9SVB0|5|nice shirt
B001I45Y1W|5|I bought these gloves for my fourteen year hold son. He has big hands so he needs a bigger glove and these worked out great.
B00CCJA8AO|5|Seemed a little small for a medium.
B009NA6I40|5|Have been purchasing Wolverine shoes for over 10 years. Needed some new socks recently and my usual brand was no longer being made. Randomly found that Wolverine makes these so I order a few sets. Fit just right. Nothing too fancy, just what was needed and pleased with product.
B006V4XB28|5|nice and professional looking
B009D81KCM|1|Very difficult to use, keeps warm but it is so hard to wear it, very uncomfortable. Stay away from this junk.
B00J2KOATQ|2|product was smaller than described and a jersey like fabric
B00A36O9KS|4|Very nice. I'm kind of tall I wish it was a little longer.
B000A38DUG|5|these jeans were just what I thought they were. They were shipped promptly. I did not have any problems with jeans or the shipper. Would order from them again.
B004XW9YA8|5|fits great lots of room to move in...made well...will look for more items like this to buy..cant wait to show it off.
B00FCLVCJK|4|These training underpants are average, and there was nothing spectacular about them but they do fit normal size. I purchased a size 2 and they were accordingly.
B009EPOL0M|5|Belt is lovely. It looks just like the picture with a big flower just like I wanted. The belt fits very well on an average thin person. I am a size 4 and I had to put it on the second hole. If you are bigger than a size 8 or 10 I would not get this belt.
B003E1PRDM|4|I've even run in it. I'm hot in everything but need to shade my face. This is cooler than a full hat and has a wide brim. It closes with Velcro in the back and the tie is just for looks. :)
B003L7JPE6|5|Excellent, I get a lot of complements
B002K9BS3C|3|love this jacket. it fits perfectly and keeps the right amount of warmth. the only thing is i ordered heather grey and recieved black.
B00H5J64F4|5|price was good and i like the design of these pants....better than most i have purchased
B00T4H16NK|5|Very comfortable
B00E6F8PMK|5|Was a little large in the top for me, I am more of a pear. But the dress is fantastic and beautiful! Received many compliments on color, style, embroidery, and fabric!! AND when the first dress was received with a slight flaw, I was able to return it and they sent me a replacement immediately!! Awesome! Thank you!!
B007OVB5IE|5|Based on other reviews I went for the L with some apprehension, but when they arrived they fit me perfectly. I'm 5'4 so with regular sneakers the hem will hit right above floor line.
B00LAF0Y82|4|cozy and comfortable
B00B4NIOPU|5|Love the length and texture of this scarf. I get a lot of compliments on it.
B007P0HDBW|5|Very Good!!!
B00PYBH5TY|5|OK
B003STK0O6|5|it fits perfectly... love it!
B0039ZQ67Y|5|I wanted pants that are comfortable, durable, and can be worn either to do yard work or for general casual wear instead of standard jeans.  These fit the bill perfectly.  The fit is exactly as I expected.  I've tried on and rejected plenty of pants as being a little too snug, although I'm not particularly overweight, but these are roomy enough that I have no problems with them at all.  The difference between these and the Dickies relaxed fit carpenter pants is subtle; these are slightly softer to the touch, having been \\"sanded,\\" so I prefer them, although the carpenter pants are nice as well.  Otherwise they're virtually identical.  The fabric is heavy duty cotton. They have a wide (3\\") hammer loop on the left and two long, narrow pockets on the right, but otherwise are styled like jeans.  The color is a subdued slate green--not flashy.
B00DGOBRN6|4|The sweater is really warm, which is good for the cold. I think they should sell these sweaters in our local clothing store.
B00KMCKK2O|1|they were extremely tight … even though they were a lil too small they were too thick felt like my skin was being suffocated it was uncomfortable
B00C9VN9KG|3|A little small, color is a grey blue.
B00L5SZKFG|5|They love these
B005SU7SE8|5|Finally a kufi that fits! I have a relatively large head and this kufi stretches excellently to fit me. It also looks great.
B00CHRYI98|5|great gift for honor student going to high school this year.
B002BM5ZS2|4|Got it as a gag. Came a bit deformed and was really cheap novelty, but it was really cheap so I really didn't care.
B00M8WZSDM|1|I love this nightshirt, but it runs at least 1 size small.  I have an earlier version in the same size and it fits perfectly.
B005RYFQ4Y|5|Is really hard to find this shirts, they are at a really good price and very we'll made I plan on ordering more in the future
B00JXCW6O4|5|Great!!
B00KXDP6Z8|3|It's cute. A little shorter than anticipated. Make sure to wear light/pink colored underwear because it is see through.
B00C9U0I7Y|4|First, I want to review the material. I wasn't too impressed with the spandex material of the costume, in the picture it looks differently. Second, I ordered the Small/Medium size originally, but when it arrived it was loose on me and didn't flatter my body. I'm 5'5&#34; 130 lbs. I then ordered the size X-small/Small and it fit perfectly! Fit like a glove and hugged all of my curves. Although, I didn't love the material at first in the end with a much better fitting size I was very happy with the overall costume and end result. I would say order a smaller size so it hugs your body. It's like wearing a full bodysuit.
B00T83KJXS|2|I ordered a medium and received a small. This Was The One Thing My Child Begged For For HD Birthday today. He will be very dissapointed.
B002GM7VIE|5|I bought three bras for the price of two in stores - thanks so much.......
B00TXIDDFO|5|they said it was profect with no problem thanks again
B008VPS986|4|New material? Not as silky as same product I purchased 5 years ago.<br />And I seem to sweat more in these....<br />I do like the new elastic waistband....and thanks for keeping the drawstring.<br />Great sleep shorts, still. Just not as perfect as they were....
B0006UD74U|5|If you want to feel like a princess or Queen, this is the set for you!  I bought the robe and nightgown and I feel glamorous and sexy in it.  I'm 5'9 so it doesn't go to the ground as shown on the model but that didn't really matter to me.  It's beautiful!
B00JK06M7Q|5|Cute outfit.  It's true to size.  You can dress it up or down, wear heels or flats.  I Love It!!!
B00G36B4O6|5|Looks good. Size as expected. Looks trendy.
B002A28VB6|5|I love the 3/4 sleeve being pettite every other robe is too sloppy.  This one is soft.  It is warm enough but not too warm since I live in Florida.  I am very happy and will likely by a second one as backup for when this one gets old.
B00GMJ790M|1|I bought this set of sports bras to wear when exercising(walking on the treadmill, lifting weights) When these arrived, they looked great, nice material, and I love the front closure, but after trying this on, I realized I should have invested more money.  These sports bras offer absolutely no support for a large chest, and being that these are plus size, most women have just that.  I tried wearing it for a day, and it was almost like wearing a cropped tank top underneath my shirt.  I would definitely not recommend this product, spend a little more money.
B005OFLTCY|5|Bow chicka wow wow. My husband loves these! And I love them on him! :-)
B002X8FSK4|5|Warm, thick, great for winter wear.  They are very thick if you try to wear them with shoes, but the shoes still fit just fine.  I mainly wear them around the house.  They are good under boots, too.  I got every color indicated on the package.  They are all the same size.  They all fit my feet exactly the same.   I've had these for nearly a year now, and they are STILL as good condition as they were when I first bought them.  They hold up very well in the wash, I use warm or hot water, and I dry them on HOT heat.  I also wash them with my regular clothes.   Yes, they produce some lint, at least in the beginning; but so do my other clothes, so I don't see these as any different than sweaters or cotton clothing or anything else that produces some lint.  Now that it's been almost a year, they hardly produce any lint and yet the socks are still as thick and warm as they ever were.  These were definitely a terrific bargain.  I highly recommend.
B00M9H2MHG|4|I was pleased; it is what I wanted.  I would like to find a narrower belt of the same design.
B00HSIVHVS|5|I am 5 ft 2 in - usually get a large because of the was waist - Medium was perfect.
B002DYSG1Q|4|I am pleased with my business with Amazon.Thank you,
B000YT6W6I|3|I got these in hopes of staying modest while being able to wear an unpadded bra under any shirt I wanted. You have to be careful on how you use these. You can't just slap them on and forget you have breasts. If you wear them under certain tops and don't place them exactly right, it will make your areolas look huge and prominent. For the most part they will keep nips under control. I still feel a little naked with them though. If you have sensitive skin you'll need to watch so you don't get a rash. If I wear them all day and get hot and sweat, I'll have two large red circles where they were placed.    They would stay in place if you wore them without a bra.     I'd buy them again, I suppose, to have as a tool in my underwear drawer. They weren't the end-all solution I was looking for, however.
B00DG7FS4M|5|One of my nicer tee shirts. It doesn't cling and it is a solid shirt that breathes and moves well when I work out.
B0073YHIMO|5|My 9 year old son absolutely loves them! He was so excited-this was his favorite Christmas present!  He's worn them everywhere!
B00U7U14GC|5|I need to exchange for a larger pair. A 2XL
B008J1XO3C|2|they should state the length of the skirt in the description because it does not look as short as it really is in the picture!
B00BPJP8T8|3|Very small and light. Much thinner and smaller than expected. The material feels nice, but is meant for decoration only. When you get it, it is very long and narrow, and meant for someone with a smaller head or without a large amount of hair. Maybe even for a child. It wasn't a bad product, but it wasn't what I was looking for.
B000NZW3IY|5|I am a US Navy sailor, on board USS John C. Stennis. The fact that I am visiting this page on Amazon should serve as enough evidence to justify my credentials when it comes to recognizing general awesomeness. Enough has been said up to this point about the 3WM shirt, that to add anything else would be unnecessary. Also, it would be unwarranted at this juncture, as I DON'T OWN THE SHIRT YET.<br /><br />Now, \\"how could this be?\\" you must be asking yourself. A person typing a review for the finest shirt on the planet, who claims to know something about being radical, yet doesn't own this shirt?<br /><br />For whatever reason, the website won't allow me to have this shirt shipped to an FPO-AP address. I am hoping this is a problem with a bad ship internet connection, or just some unusual 2 am finnickyness brought about by the stars or some nonsense, but seeing that \\"Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt cannot be shipped to the selected address\\" message pop up has been breaking my heart over and over again, during the course of the last five hours. Until you help me (please oh please), I shall remain glued to this computer indefinitely. Gone the way of the beautiful nymph narcissus sitting poolside, I shall be left to a slow death at the hands of lethargy and starvation, vainly clicking away in hopes that maybe that next click will prompt a positive reaction from the confusing and hateful God of internets.<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting the abilities to see through lead walls, make women orgasm spontaneously via dance, scale jagged mountain peaks without using any of my five primary limbs, and being able to talk to my dog Ozzie; but until this horrid situation is remedied, looks like I'm stuck lonely and sad, Munsoned and hopeless.<br /><br />PS:  Also, how the hell are we ever supposed to win that war on terror or whatever? If Charlie can get the shirt, but it can't be shipped to the boat, than I forsee some pretty bad news stuff in the near future. Bullets are dangerous for non wolf shirt wearers.olf shirt wearers.
B0082MR08I|4|I am an average-sized 5'5&#34;, fyi.  Because there doesn't seem to be any relationship between sizing and size charts, I ordered a small and a medium.  The small is comfy and fits well, and the medium is way too big.  I like the feel of the fabric--cozy and warm, but not too heavy.  I find it soft and comfortable to sleep in--it breathes adequately for me.  I like the cut of the neck and sleeves very much--a comfortable fit, but not sloppy looking. The price is not too bad, things being what they are these days.  I got black and grey and am happy to have them both in small. The only thing I'm wondering about is if there will be shrinkage over time. (Disclaimer: I wash in cold and hang dry everything I care about.)
B006JJXPSK|5|Excellent quality prayer shawl.  I enjoy it immensely.  Very long, which is good for my 6'0\\" frame.  I recommend this product highly.  Very much like the picture.
B00KFFLOMI|2|Neon green, yellow as shown
B00F9NP0GM|4|I have to start out by saying DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS STATING IT'S TOO SMALL!!! I don't know whats wrong with everyone, but you just have to loosen the back before trying it on! Its a corset! I bought a medium and I'm 36 bust, 27 waist, and 34 at the hips, and it fits PERFECT!<br /><br />Arrived early. I wasn't expecting to get this for about another month. That's a big plus.
B002FA58GY|1|Too flat not puffy like picture
B00EY99ZUO|5|This dress was made very well and the sizes are true to fit. Excellent for a casual or dress occasion.
B00KQ4CDFA|5|I'm a huge &#34;Fan&#34; of Sperry! Love their shoes. Thank you so much for having these socks on your site. I love them very much :-)
B0016GMXHK|5|very good
B00TATMFJ6|5|like
B0001ZMD4A|5|I received product in less than 5 days! When it arrived, I was very pleased. It is a nice lightweight jacket. I ordered the yellow jacket, and am pleased that it is as bright as the picture shows. Just what I wanted! Now my husband and son both want one!
B00A8LSH0G|4|Nice scarf. It has more texture with the weaving that you can't really see in the photos. Lightweight so it's easy to pack in a bag or purse while traveling.
B003CJ11Y0|5|excellent costume
B00DU7JTRK|5|EXCELLENT
B00LHFKZBG|3|Nice material, thicker spandex than I imagined. Definitely run small
B009R1BZPM|3|When I  bought this I didn't notice that it's super long, styled so the bottom of the sweater really clings to your butt.  Then as you go around it slowly rides up so it's bunched up around your waist.  Also not very good quality knit, but I still kept it as I need a baggy black sweater.  I shortened it so it fits more like I want it to, and it will do till I find a better-quality item.
B00BQJVZQM|3|The details on this shirt are sewn on with a synthetic thread, kind of like super thin fishing line. It becomes exposed after washing. Runs a little big, but other than that it is what you would expect from Lucky.
B00DG9IPN6|5|Excellent Product, quick delivery!
B000783PW0|3|A bit too long but it is very good material and made well, It may well shrink the first time it washed.
B002U4LD8C|3|Our daughter loved these jeans- but 2-3 weeks after wearing them the leg stitching began to come out and the button popped off... Jeans shipped in time and the seller was great to work with.
B000ILGDXE|3|These socks are very cute to look at. I've been looking for this design for a while now being from Canada and its hard to come by in the US.  As for comfort and warmth they aren't at the top of my list. They ran a little bit larger since they are mens and I am a size 10 womens, but no biggie not bunched up or odd. I will say that they are not very warm at all, like at all (or that soft for that matter). I personally find that i need to wear a pair of socks underneath them for both of those reasons. But i bought these for esthetics more so than warmth.
B0053XF874|5|These hi-waist flexees give excellent control without been too tight, and they stay put at the waist
B000HGB182|3|didn't quite fit, but we were able to make it work.
B00EAK3HF6|5|Was amazed how perfectly this fit.  Ordered it in Black the next day.  I am new to PattyBoutik and love their line.  Never have a problem w/fit for my curvy figure.
B0098GDWAC|5|...and is good looking (that's according to my wife). Made of high quality materials. The color is perfect too. Altogether one sharp thermal.
B00MA91W88|4|This was a gift to an unknown child so I do not know how it fit.
B00076ZRWS|3|I am commenting on it right out of the package. It fit a little roomy. I am a medium average build. It didn't seam as form fitting as the picture. Given I am an athletic build but neat as much muscle. It feels starchy or stiff. Lets see how it is after a wash.
B00CN7VHOQ|5|This suit jacket exceeded our expectations.  The color was sharp, the fit was great, and the cost was definitely affordable--especially for a sports coat as great as this one was!
B00AVBFH9M|5|Everything was as expected.  It was a gift for someone.
B004I5TZ4A|5|could be underwear or swim shorts, very colorful and just great. Usually I wear CK or 2xist and these are just as good if not better.
B005CSOMHW|5|Best shorts I have bought.
B00ENGRT88|5|This was a present, so we don't know how it fit, but we do know that the recipient was very happy and loved having &#34;all original parts&#34;!
B00DZEZKOY|2|Manufacturing defects
B008CERQ6W|4|Love this robe. Bought as a gift and they LOVED it! Soft and beautiful! The quality was high compared to the price paid!
B009OFI5S6|5|Feel like an animal, walk like an animal, yell like an animal, mostly when u waer this u become an ani-AR ARR RARR RRARR RARRAA AAR ARRR ARRR
B003FSSP0Q|5|Love my shirt!!!!
B00XI8GX8O|5|Great t-shirts that fit as expected.
B00CQ8R106|4|These pants are worth it for the price, they cover everything and the quality is sturdy. Best thing about them is they arent see through! Which is what i was worried about when ordering.
B00BGEM4QC|5|I love it. It fits very well. The colors are even brighter in person.
B002AQRP5U|1|Numbers are too small, very difficult to play
B00BGIMJSQ|4|The only problem i found was the shorts were way too big for the individual i purchased the costume for. It would be nice if I could have mixed sizes. Otherwise, great costume !!
B00N3X8D1E|5|I actually bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas because she loves zombies as much as I do. She loved it. Thanks!
B00PBPVL3O|2|Jacket is way too small.  My husbands always wears a Large size and it is what I always order.  However, this jacket is way too small - should be sized as a medium.  I will probably be returning it after Christmas.  Was very disappointed.
B00KXU0QNI|5|Great backpack I use it  for work. This is my second one the first DC backpack I had lasted over ten years.
B00CEH1Q1Y|5|They didn't come to big too small... they breathe nicely. I don't have any of that annoying rubbing some underwear have.
B004CVKFEY|4|Very nice, but I bought this item in two colors for only $19.99 at Macy's in Fairfax, VA, although Macy's website still lists it at $24.99.
B00IFY3BCC|3|The shirt is smaller than expected, thin material, + took a very long time to arrive. But, it's cute, + I will keep it.
B0006IXE9K|4|I have very narrow shoulders so will take the straps up some.
B00C9Y2V02|5|I like it very much. nice color and nice quality. Just hat seems to be small even for the newborn baby. but I like it anyway.
B0076JV0DO|5|Good product as described
B00NRGTIJS|5|Great little hat no loose strings, balls are heavily sown on
B00K00WHQA|1|Returned the product as it is too small for my wife. Waste of shipping money both ways :(
B00LVNOYJS|5|Warm and pretty
B00GGXL6TO|5|It was a bit small but the people at Barnett HD were awesome,  Ii will definitely patronize them again & soon, Sue M
B00816RXV4|4|I was very happy with the price and the product. Not the softest material and runs a little big but given the price I am happy to have them for night shirts for my girl.
B00LWE7NOO|1|So I read the reviews that said these shorts fell apart and still bought them.  Today was the first day I wore them.  It was a lazy Saturday, didn't do much yard work or anything.  And one pocket snap pulled clean through the fabric (and I was treating them gently since I read the reviews).  The waist snap came apart and fell off.  The fabric is light and comfortable, but I think it is just flimsy and comfortable.  I'll wear the pairs that I bought until they can no longer be fixed but I will never waste money on these again.  I suggest you do the same and don't buy them.
B003376NAS|5|Good product
B00F5L1H7Y|3|I recently ordered this dress in a size 10, dark purple.  First of all, very pretty dress, if only it would have fit correctly.  I typically wear either a size 8 or size 10.  I have a 36C bra size, so I ordered a 10 thinking easier to alter to take in than to let out material because I went by the size chart that was pictured.  Well, the dress was too small in the chest area and the padding didn't quit line up either.  If I pulled the dress down to match the padding in the bra area with my chest, it was too tight and the shoulder area would have to been altered because it was too loose. The waist fit but, it pushed the top part of the dress further up my body, making the chest area not line up, so it didn't fit correctly. I am what you call short waisted, which means for those who don't know, the distance between my waist and my chest is short and the distance between my chest and shoulders is short.  This causes a problem with some dresses. This dress fit at the top the way a camisole fits when you have to adjust the straps in order so that they don't fall down, but the darts for the chest area are up high.  For those of you who have that problem, I think you know what I am talking about.  I believe this dress is made for those who have a normal or long waistline.  Don't buy, if you are one who always has to try on dresses because you wear a different size depending on how it is made.
B0037DVJ3E|3|I like the quality of the material but it is not a perfect like some other manufacture item I bought previously.
B0040HIRZO|4|This served it's purpose but the TAIL should be more adjustable for little ones~  and it was not big enough for adults either.
B00D3F7FIO|5|This Shirt jacket is more of a jacket to me due to the thickness and weight of the material.  I was kind of looking for a really thick work shirt, like a flannel lined long sleeve and I found this.  It had really good ratings so I decided to try it out.  I really really like it, it looks like the shirt/jacket will outlive me even with severe use and abuse which I will definitely put it through.  It's something I can use outside in the winter, the material is so thick and well constructed that I think it is almost windproof.  The fireproofing is just a plus and probably what gives it some of the weight.  It fits very well and is comfortable to move around with good articulation.  I'm almost don't want to get it dirty and greasy or whatever but then again I want to see how well it hold up to use and abuse as well.
B002IEPB00|4|I got a medium, should have got a large, fits a little snug, but still wearable, I live in a very hot climae, and like my arms covered, and this is light weight enough for summer heat.
B00BN4N3I8|5|Better than any underwear I have purchased: Calvin Klein, 2(X)ist, Emporio Armani, Jockey. The quality is excellent, very well-crafted. Finally a pouch for things. In this regard, they offer a nice balance of lift and support in front. I wear them everyday because they are extremely comfortable. You will not be disappointed.
B00FHMF3TY|4|This dress is prettier than pictured. As one of the reviewers said, it is big at the bust; waist and hip fit perfect. I usually wore a Juniors small, 100-101lbs. It may not be an issue if you are well endowed but I found a way around it by wearing an extra-padded push up bra:).  I will be buying from this company again.
B00A2Y1W4C|4|These are better than the average cheap yoga pant but if you want a lifted, firm looking butt I am firmly an &#34;Alki'i Luxurious Cotton Lycra Fold over Yoga Pants&#34; believer. These are more lounging pants than yoga, as they have less elasticity and feel more like a lazy day pant than an activity pant.<br /><br />These fit well and are maybe a smidgeon long. I'm 5'9 (a longer torso than legs) and 150lbs.
B0044JE9VE|2|Fits great and looks great the first time you wear it before you wash it. Followed washing directions and it shrunk quite a bit and after 2 washes the collar has started to unthread right in the center of my neck leaving a big hole. So I got to wear it 3 times. Gets 2 stars because at least it was cool once.
B002T6N68G|2|I like the Darya Trading Company, I really do.<br /><br />They have nice products and good service.<br /><br />But, in this case, BEWARE THE COLOR!<br /><br />I ordered this suit in Banana Cream.  Indeed, the color is why I ordered it as I was looking for a yellow linen jacket to wear with jeans. And, while the suit is nice, material is nice, etc. THE COLOR IS ANYTHING BUT BANANA CREAM, IT'S NOT EVEN YELLOW!!!<br /><br />Indeed, the Banana Cream is BEIGE!<br /><br />BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.
B000GGM3Z8|1|This coat is not warm at all. It is definitely not suitable for winter temperatures. The buttonholes are a bit too small for the buttons, so it is difficult to get on and off. And the 9-12 mos. size is way too big for my 11-month-old, who usually wears size 12 mos.
B0098E988E|5|I ordered this kimono in pink for my teeny-tiny 18-year old granddaughter, who LOVES everything Japanese.  She put it on immediately and didn't take it off the rest of the night.  She will be the best dressed freshman at Texas State.  I'm so happy I decided to get this for her...she thinks I'm cool :))
B00S97WVNA|4|Looks great, get many compliments. I usually wear a large to 1x, but ordered 3x and fits great. Did throw a couple in the dryer, too tight around chest now. It may stretch out, still wear it, just keep pulling it down over chest. Sure it would work fine with sports bra. Anyway I bought three, will get more.
B00LJLST98|5|I love it!  Looks elegant and expensive. I chose the BRANDY color which is really beautiful!
B00LOLJ24O|4|Nice
B002A88RG4|5|Bought these for my son's girlfriend. She wanted \\"fun legwarmers w/ enough stretch they will fit comfortably\\". She was very pleased w/ them & wanted the info to purchase more.She is about 5'9\\" or so with average/plus legs & they were just what she wanted. Plenty of stretch but they stayed where she wanted!
B00411VA5S|5|Much better quality than I expected.  As others have said, a bit on the big side.  (I typically wear a 10 and the M/L was plenty big.)  Boyfriend about swallowed his tongue.  Was pretty comfortable and fun to wear.
B001AWYRZG|4|It's a very beautiful and good quality costume (in spite of the brightness in the cape disappear a bit), you'll see that the dress is very beautiful and colorful :) . Everyone loved it on me! I saw the reviews and decided to order a smaller size. It was a bit short to me, but I have a big butt, so i think if I've asked for the correct size it still would be short only in the butt, because the rest was perfect. It's a really good price for the quality.
B000MNHMJM|4|Disappointed  because item description said Made in USA but hat is made in China. However seems like a nice hat.
B00KKREB6C|5|Cool hat. Glad I bought it.  Decent quality for the price.
B00KQT79TA|5|These scrubs are great! I have been in the medical field over 20 years and have tried numerous brands of scrubs. For years, my favorite pants were Koi Lindsey. I usually wear XS Petite. After reading the reviews for these pants, I ordered a size larger. I don't know if that was necessary. I am afraid if I order the usual XS they may be too tight. But they do run smaller than the usual Lindsey scrubs.  These pants do not lose their shape, they are not baggy, especially in the legs. I recently read to soak new clothes in vinegar water before the first washing. I did this and hope to see that they are slower to fade. It will be hard to go back to the old pants as these are so comfortable. I usually pull my pants up all day and was not necessary with these.
B00OWIEH0K|5|excellent.
B0019LQE6I|5|I recently ordered this and another similar dress from One World Sarong's.  Not only did I get them within 3 days of placing the order, they are also exactly as described.  The material is light and airy, the colors are great and seems to be made well.  I will definitely order from this company again.
B00EYBI75G|5|excellent
B00K5VZ8CY|5|The shirt does run a bit small so I ordered one size larger.
B000A2K9TA|5|these are  great pants.  True to size, if not a tad large but nothing that a belt won't fix.  My son says they are comfortable and they are very good quality
B00PKK2008|4|Love it, love it, and love it!
B002RWJ7YO|5|Great Father's Day gift.
B00FYVF3VG|2|Somewhat small
B00A1S09HU|4|I love them but my little man is pretty thin but tall for a 14 month old.. He usually wears 2t clothing but these just fit larger then most but once he grows into then they'll be good
B00CPWBE4C|5|The varying sizes meant that I could use these in all of my shirts (which each have different sized collars). It's great.
B00HTM0JNA|1|Does not look like the pic when u get it
B0002ITNP8|2|The Raffia cowboy hat was not an adult hat it was a kid size hat. The desciption did not say it was for kids. The type of hat was correct but my granddaughter now has a new hat, she is six years old and it fits her.<br />Not happy!!!!
B008LKFIXK|5|Excellent shirt.
B00MRKO2MS|3|Not quite as pictured.
B002LMAB72|1|I did not like this bra at all. Wrong fit and no support. I almost feel like not wearing a bra would provide equal or more support. NOt recommended
B00DNUNLI2|5|They are warm and definitely waterproof. good price. The size was a bit short for my daughter, who is a petite (I bought medium- she is 157 cm and 45 kilos), but if I had got her the larger size, they would have been too wide. Anyway, with the boots, they worked out perfectly
B00N54NAGO|5|I said fit as expected cause we expected very small and revealing and it is just that! very sexy I love it and my girl loves wearing it!
B0076R6MVQ|3|Good
B00CE3IXV4|3|I ordered this outfit in a size 18 month and when I received it , it was about a 12 month size.  It fit my granddaughter the same as the 12 month size she was wearing. The quality was good for the price.
B00LHPEL7K|5|He loved it
B00SB390TA|3|I purchased a large, it fits well around my waist, etc and I have small boobs so works well for me, it is a bit short though...Really, ReaLLLLLy short!! Cheap material also, very noticeable. I'm 5'7 and currently at 155 #
B008B803J6|3|nice shirt but longer and larger than expected even though I ordered smallest junior size.
B002JLFMLK|1|I am 5&#34;5 and weight 160, I got a size medium because I needed the compression and the only compression I felt was in my crutch, which was extremely uncomfortable, not please with this product at all!!
B00MJVSS1G|5|Love it..... Bought every color
B00DIS3TCW|4|So my son believe he is some type of Tarzan that should run around the house in his underwear. Therefore cloths is not a priority for him. He need this sweat for his class concert, I need red but he hates red so I went the mixture of colors. Over it is a good sweater
B0068U71DK|1|scratched and has a pieces missing off the lens after 1 week!
B0045I7OUC|4|I don't have words about Kenneth Cole products. This is really amazing long sweater tunic that I bought for my wife in Valentine's gift. She was happy ever.
B00FA7G08E|4|Adorable.
B00ATRA202|5|My daughter loved the top. She loves the color purple and this had different shades of purple on it. Thanks.
B00GMRBB8A|5|Im a huge comic nerd and i love iron fist. He is absolutely one of marvels most underated characters. The shirt got here in no time at all and it fit perfectly. I put it on right after i took it out of the package and i love it.
B00IQG86ME|4|I absolute love it! I'm very skinny and isn't easy to find something that will fit me perfectly even for my small breast. The reason I don't give 5 starts is because one lateral strap is slightly loose but overall I'm very happy
B00DO9ZHVG|5|I was very impressed with the bra as after breastfeeding for over a year I needed some help with my new look! Great cleavage effect. The further apart I stuck them the bigger cleavage I got. They have a firm stick so I was never worried they would fall off. Worked brilliantly with my recent backless dress at a friends summer wedding and still working now. I would definitely recommend.
B002GHC2OW|5|This jacket looks great on my husband and keeps him warm
B00GT94UF2|5|It was the perfect gift
B0055X1NYE|5|I just had a baby and I need to constantly wear body shapers, as I am very conscious of my body. I am 5.4 feet, and currently weigh 150 Lb. I usually wear size Medium, but I got this in Small to have maximum control on the abdomen area, and Im glad I did.<br /><br />I got this to replace some pieces that are not at all comfortable or practical to wear all day, I must say I love every little detail about this piece, I wear my cloths with much more confidence and comfort, I reordered this in another color
B0077HY69U|5|I love my shorts, the only issue is that they fit slightly large, but they do have the drawstring so I just pull them a little tighter. I ordered the large and a medium would have been perfect.  I'm still satisfied with my purchase, the price was right and I will definitely order again.
B0081TFR8W|2|Was entirely too small... Will be returning...
B00CEH1ONY|5|Quality product.-well made.
B002DUCG1G|2|As several other reviewers mentioned, this item tends to have very poor snaps.  I decided to try my luck and purchased two sets of overalls anyway and, sure enough, within a few days, once of the snaps had already detached, and over the next few weeks, several more came off as well.  It's a shame, because the outfit itself is very simple and cute and just what I was looking for otherwise.
B00LI2XRBI|4|This goes hand-in-hand with my other review for the matching Dickies waffle knit thermal top. As with the shirt, I got the size I thought would fit me best (LT). I'm 6' 3&#34; and was pleasantly surprised to find the legs on these pants to be a bit long. In the waist, they're a little loose, but not to the point of drooping or falling off my backside (my waist size is 37&#34;). Like I mentioned with the shirt, this is actually a good thing because there's extra room to 'layer' additional thermal pants under these for more warmth. The color has held fast after several washings and the shrinkage has been almost nil. Very good thermal pants and would buy again.
B008U0KLNS|4|You just need to improve the clips
B009VNANWC|5|Great value. Exactly what I was looking for. Some linting at first wash, but cleared up after that
B003H7BG74|4|It is a really stylish way to carry your contacts. The only problem I have with it is, it is difficult to get the lids off while in the case, and it is difficult to get the contact holder out. For the cost, it's great.
B007C3ZJ0O|5|Very cute and well made.  He looks adorable in them.  Would buy them again! Just what every little boy needs.
B00Y0FPY3Y|3|It's a great costume it comes with every thing you need but. I pick the XL and The pants where too long with a waist that my sister can't even put on and the jacket was to wide. The size is sorta all over the place. But the quality is there. Good buy but I recommend sending your size
B000LXK4LG|1|I chose this rating because I had to pick a star. would be preferred to of given no stars Cuz after one wearing without washing they were completely covered in anything possible that would stick to it and lots or fuzz from blankets or anything .  I'm very unhappy with them don't know where they're made but you should check for if made in China do not buy them Levis were a U.S. product & should of stayed that way. I would not recommend this to anyone . I'm Very unhappy and when you do wash them it doesn't come off.. I was very happy with jeans bought from &#34;Elite Hero company&#34; Perfect all around. (Dickies)
B00AO32DU8|5|Easy to put on ,feels very comfortable and I like the way you can change the skirt by pulling it up with the cord or let it down.
B00FA7YO1O|5|Looks like the picture, very pretty. The recipient was thrilled.
B0036BJ0R4|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  Maroon is a nice deep shade.  Thickness, width, texture, and construction are of high quality.  And, the best, it leaves no lint on shirt or suit collars like so many of the other fabric scarves I've tried.  Will buy another one in a different color.
B00B58FTVQ|5|Like the product.
B002C0MCP2|4|The hat arrived at my house very shortly after I ordered it.  It fits great, looks great and keeps my head and ears warm when its cold out.
B00V5ABUJ4|1|I did not like it. The top does not squeeze. It is just open. Several times after putting it into my handbag the lens of my glasses pops out after a little pressure.
B009C99F2O|4|I bought this little pajama set on purpose because Thomas the Train is my 2 year old grandson's favorite character!  It's a Christmas present along with other &#34;Thomas&#34; themed items.  I imagine he will be totally thrilled with his presents.  I'm happy I found these pajamas on Amazon along with all of the other things too!  Thank you Amazon for being able to carry the large volume of items!
B0056EVOEQ|5|Good quality and fit with a great theme.  My husband loves it and has enough muscles that it almost looks like a padded Captain America costume.
B0025JTES8|5|Great patch for my collection
B006SRTFWI|5|warm
B0021AETBS|4|I have owned several Greoffery Beene shirt in the pass, I will continue to purchase there shirts. Great price also
B004QJQUTQ|5|I've been on a seemingly endless quest for the perfect sock and I finally found it.  This is the most comfortable sock that I've ever worn.  I've been a hiker for 35 years and have found socks that are a 9 out of 10.  This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've found.  I'm not a big fan of wool and this sock met that criterion as well.  Two thumbs up!
B00JV5XP9I|4|The quality of the shirt is excellent and the color is great. The only complaint I have is that it's a Father's Day item and it was delivered a day after Father's Day. The company took a day to process the order before shipping and shipping took a full 5 days. They should have rushed it given that they knew it was bought to wear on Father's Day. Amazon would have made sure the item was shipped out immediately.
B00JKFSXN2|3|Bought this for my 7 y/o around Thanksgiving. She wears it at least 3 x a week to school. The fit is great and it looks good but it has a couple of holes in it already :( .
B005OH9I1Q|5|Good quality dress belt which is perfect for various occasions.  I was happily surprised by the appearance.  Well worth the money
B00APRP8KU|2|I ordered the 160D Black item, the alternate double zipper gray item arrived (161D) and I actually really liked this style so I decided to return the gray item and purchase the same style in black.<br /><br />upon receiving the black item I noticed it was a lot stiffer and not as soft, I looked for stitching tags to notice the previous gray item was 100% cotton while my recent black purchase was 35% polyester blend.<br /><br />I was upset about this so I contacted Doublju for more information, I stated my question clearly and my first response they only seemed to read a small portion of my question as i was told the sizing chart...<br /><br />The second response said that the 35% polyester blend was a typo and that all the items were 100% cotton, now obviously this was not true I had in my hands 2 different colors of the same style and they both had stitching tags that obviously stated different as well as being able to tell just by touching the material I understand doublju is a Korean retailer and don't get me wrong these items are of great quality for the price but information and customer service really is lacking.<br /><br />Should my issue be solved after having to purchase this item 3 different times to get what I should have gotten the first Ill update this but still be wary you may be in the same situation.
B00NOD2EOK|5|Came quick, it's more a Jr Large, than a womans Large.
B00ACIGU7W|5|Great
B0088JETFW|4|The case took quite a while to get here but when it did it looked exactly as pictured. It fit snugly on my iPhone 4s and didn't have to take it off to charge. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the second I dropped it, from like a foot off the ground, it totally cracked. It protected the phone from damage though.  Not sure if it is real bamboo because for the price I'd expect it to have stayed in tact.
B0021AVF7O|5|This is one of my favorite bras.  The fit is perfect and best of all, the straps do not slip off at all.  I'm finding Betsy Johnson bras to be the best fitting and most comfortable bras.  They are nice under work blouses as well as t-shirts.  Highly recommended.
B00B7TBY44|4|Pleasantly surprised. Order a size up
B00B1ACBEG|5|ITS WARM AS TO BE EXPECTED HAD IT ON IN 7* WEATHER DIDNT GET COLD......
B0013U9STA|4|It's very nice.. But I think If it was cheaper it will be better.. Anyway it's not bad.. Thank you
B000TN7U0Q|5|I LOVE the pattern, and it's SO SOFT! I love it! I'm going to have to buy another one..
B00MZHKSKI|5|I was sent a discounted pair to review, and I LOVE them. The sizing is perfect (fitted but not too snug), the fabric is very soft and comfortable, and the length is perfect (a few inches below my knee- I'm 5' tall for reference). I definitely plan to order a couple more pairs!
B00DRJ3SFK|1|Poor matrieal waste of money
B00J9E1MHS|5|Very nice detailing, high quality look and fabrication.
B006W2P45Q|2|The quality and price is very good. The product is super cute but the it comes off in a sec. The back at the heels is very short so it doesn't stay
B00KNQQ8YI|4|The large fit my 90 pound daughter very tightly.  I would recommend that you buy one size up.
B00A2WIZ5S|5|Runs small so size up. I have a large chest so the words are stretched lol so if you have a large chest and usually wear a large...get the 2X
B00CHNNO5G|5|Since buying one of these for my son, i've had to order one for my husband. This hat is loved by them both and has replaced all others in their usual rotation.<br /><br />It fits snug enough to cover the ears nicely, but is not too tight. This is the perfect winter hat.
B00EEFAJ8A|5|Light and airy but does help you stay warm. I ordered large size due to other leggings I had that really form fit but the Cuddl Duds run on not skimping.
B00GGCEFA2|4|The quality is definitely Levis! Great fit and very comfortable!! The description is incorrect...no RED levis tag on the left breast pocket.
B000AL97WQ|1|I ordered 4 pairs of these from Bealls through Amazon. I expected to receive a product that was 98% Cotton and 2% Spandex as seen in stores and elsewhere online. Unfortunately, Bealls low price was no deal because the product that arrived was labeled as 99% Cotton 1% Spandex and had significant variations in the cut from one pair to another. Also, there were several marks in the fabric (from ironing?) that appear to be permanent. Perhaps these are not authentic, or maybe they are seconds, and the factory uses the 99/1 label to indicate the difference. Returned the whole mess. Don't waste your money buying this item from Bealls.
B000OE624A|4|Bought two of these black ties because they were on the wish list of two sixteen year old cool guys
B00JWQ0ADA|4|I measure for a 36G but normally prefer The fit (and shopping convenience) of a 36DDD/E. This bra has a great fit although it is slightly snug in the band compared to other brands. My only complaint is that there are only 2 rows of hooks which is a little unusual for this cup size in my experience. This may be why the band seems a little snug.. Having the extra hook for large cup sizes seems to provide extra comfort and support and does not dig into the skin as much because the tension is spread out across 3 points of fasten instead of two.
B00OXVO6TI|5|Super cute shorts.  Very lightweight, yet opaque fabric.  Perfect for hot summer ahead in Arizona. Please note the Chaos (bright pink) does have black edging on the back of leg openings not shown in the photo.  The yellow band in front goes up and around the bottom and creates a cute arc just under the elastic waist.
B0035H6DL0|5|Totally cute!  Bought this for my 5 year old son.  It looks just like his NUNU blankie with a frog on it.  He loves it!  Has been wearing it everywhere (even in the house) for the last two days.  It is big on his head. . .but I see it being his favorite hat forever--I hope it lasts that long!  EXCELLENT quality.  These hats are spendy, way above my budget, but they are beautiful, warm, and will most definitely bring attention to yourself.  Everyone ALWAYS comments on them.  (We also got a bunny one for my daughter and a moose one for me.)  Worth the investment if you know you won't lose it!
B00UFEEHWS|4|Comfortable & wasn't hard to get on. Just a little to long for me as I am 4'11 and the clincher goes  past my waist.
B009USZPPS|3|I know I shouldn't expect too much for the price, but this looks and feel even cheaper than the price might imply. BUT, in fairness, at this age he'll grow so fast it'll probably only be worn once or twice.
B00M21BTMI|5|i loved it but had to send it back because I ordered the wrong size . everything about the bra was a five star rating.
B004OZL484|3|Hat was large as well. Too big to fit on my head.
B00FBVR93Y|4|First off, let me say that the color of this shirt is not what I expected, but I am happy with it. When I first opened it, I actually thought they had sent me the wrong top and had to look to see what the color says and it does in fact say mint. I was expecting a paler shirt. The top actually has a bright minty green color. The material feels AWESOME. It is not t-shirt material. The fit was great, the neckline not to low, not to high and the arms are a great fit as well (no-bra showing) Love the length also and it just lays so well on my curves :) It's more fitted and not as boxy looking as it is on the model. It will be great alone with a pair of jean for the summer/spring, and perfect with a cardigan in the winter and fall! Very versitale top. I am Very happy!!!
B009BQS4QQ|5|Looks like picture. Good quality. Very pretty scarf. A good fashion find for my wardrobe. Love the material ! Price was good also.
B00GSNXPMS|1|they aren't made very well
B00CKIMVVQ|2|Like the hat but specifically ordered grey and recieved a purple one. Quality of hat is good but would not recommend ordering unless you don't care about what color you get.
B00O8VPVO2|5|Beautiful coat, good quality and great fit, I love it!
B001K2CEVA|3|Ok... So maybe there are some of you out there that can relate because this item didn't work for me. I have lost over 150 pounds in the past 5 years. I thank a consistent healthy diet and daily exercise for that. However with all that weight loss, came A LOT of loose skin around my chest, torso, biceps and thighs. Cosmetic surgery is too expensive so I thought that this would help me a great deal and make me feel more confident. Boy was I wrong! Have you ever seen the way a half used tube of toothpaste looks when you squeeze it from the bottom up? Yeah, well try to imagine my flabby a$$ in this light. It did a great job of flattening my muffin top and lifting my butt however it totally pushed my man-boobs up and out like a flippin corset! I seriously looked like a `Rocky Horror Picture Show' reject sans the nylons and heels. FML! So yeah... if you have a slight gutt then this is for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend body suit or compression shirt if you are in my predicament.
B00QL2C5OK|5|red who does't love red  AWSOME! AN D HAVE THE BOOTS TO GO WITH IT THANK YOU...
B00B9HICVM|3|I read reviews ordered small should got my size, see the others orders I got different colors all same size but they are not. This color is ok size sort of!
B00SMEHFKY|5|loved the way it fits true to size
B00AFJKI8K|5|I still love the shirt although somewhat big on me. Looks just like the picture and colors are bright. Would purchase from again.
B002EDRPMM|5|This belt buckle was a present for my grandson who has his whole room decorated in wolves:curtains,comforter,rugs,lamps etc! Anyway he dropped a hint with his mother that he needed a new buckle and was extremely pleased with it when I surprised him on Christmas!
B00O3JFE0U|5|I ordered this dress in teal for my grand daughter's Easter dress. It is absolutely beautiful and well made! It was full so we didn't really need a petticoat underneath.
B003VFZLZK|5|Funny but True!!
B008DZU8E2|5|It does what it should.
B00WYYN6EC|1|Too big
B0046ED8ZU|4|I like the design and it fit me!
B002KV7QH2|1|Terrible. Junk.
B00J3AGLJW|4|Short waisted but I expected that for the pic!
B00CMRHX6S|4|These are nice. I planned to order more, but the price has increased considerably since I bought them fairly recently. At $6.99, they were good. At $10........ nahhhh
B001AU3JDE|5|I am a size 16 and this can be worn as a skirt or a dress on me. It is so soft and I hope to find/buy another one just like it in solid cream or brown. it shipped fast. I would definatly recommend buying from this seller.
B008RYTFG6|5|My daughter loves these pj's.  She says that they are very soft and wants to wear them all the time.
B00E6WWOU2|5|Love it. Well made, looks awesome.
B009XB61JQ|1|very small
B00H3QU4HS|4|The gloves are attractive, but as warm as I thought they would be as they are made by Carhartt.
B00K1BD7SU|5|my niece looks too cute in it
B00K0DOAN0|5|Very attractive..
B009S8EFI8|4|I love color, material and style.  It is very comfortable it does not make you itchy.  The only complaint i have is that it runs a bit too small in the cups (not enough coverage),  i should have ordered a size up in the cup.  I am a size 32E and every other type of bra fits perfect.  Panache is one of my favorite brand of bras but this one runs small in the cups.  I do recomend this brand to all because 99% of the time they are bang on!
B004PHNYW0|5|Gave this as a gift and they were a huge hit! Good quality and size for a large dude. My brother wore them all around Chicago and got a great response because of them. Would purchase from this vendor again.
B009BKWE9U|5|The Kilofly organizer is exactly what I was looking for.  I really love it.  I'm planning to order another one.
B007BHIDD6|5|These tights might be the best tights I have ever bought. They are thick, feel great and great color. I need to get more of every color. They are really good quality!
B00CBLT5RK|3|Comfortable
B005T3AHRE|5|Awesome shirt. Slytherin 4 life!
B00480G3GI|5|The bottom where too small when they arrived but the company wasvery helpful and nice with my return.
B00475F0VI|5|I bought this to make into a Christmas tree skirt for a very girly tree design.  I've made the &#34;tutu&#34; skirts for trees, but didn't have time this year, so bought the petticoat to do the job and it did a GREAT job!  Very cute with just a few snips and stitches.
B00S9VOUF8|3|These are true to size. My only issue was the quality of them. Its my 1st rodeo with getting briefs for my son but the set I had purchased elsewhere was costly but it felt softer and thicker, more like real cotton.  The price reflects the quality to me. Feels thin, almost as if it will rip within a few washes. I'm unsure of its suppose to be that way with this brand but it definitely fits my budget and hopefully they last until he can out grow them.
B0038Y6SRO|2|Well when I bought these socks I was expecting somthing more!  These I could literally use as dress socks but nothing more.  They are super thin!  No real dry wick capabilities at all!  If youre looking for somthing to keep you're feet dry...  These are not what you want!
B00IE2M5EU|5|Dress is beautiful and the seller was very nice to work with!
B00I5M985I|4|It is as minty as that Double Spearmint gum you are chewing right now. Yeah you, I see you chewing.
B0044B3YUY|5|My daughter saw this dress and liked it. I got it for her birthday. It arrived in timely fashion and was exactly right. The fit was great.
B00246A50I|5|Great fit, great color and great service. I'll be back.
B00OIS3WCS|5|perfect
B000P15I5G|5|Good quality & Fast delivery!
B00L8CQOWM|5|Great fit and comfortable  at gym or home.
B00B1XCRII|5|Very cute top
B00WLBFDDA|5|Love these..fit perfect. Great fabric..cheap price but not made cheap! Ordering more!
B001F5Q5T4|4|Overall I like this product very much.  However I was disappointed that they shrunk much more than I expected after the first wash and dry.  Luckily not too much.
B007674V00|4|Bought these a while ago and they are still holding up after many washings and soooooooooo sexy! Great purchase!
B00GBCW4N2|5|Love these
B0096H0LWU|1|I woud not recommend this item to anyone. It is POORLY made and there isn't even a hint of a fishtail - which was a selling point for me with my gown. I ended up purchasing a new one from elsewhere.
B0058SLO5Y|3|waist tie just does not do the job which is ashame as pants themselves are great. Waist is so huge co<br />pared with size of pants- tie was quickly gobbled up by waist aperture - recovered, tied before washing but again it was swallowed up.  Too much work for anyone.
B00CQGRYDW|4|I always get compliments on this watch, leather quality is great for the price paid. This is my second time getting the same watch. Delivery was a little delayed, not happy with that.
B00HOLZOCW|5|Really nice and my style! Thinking of a holiday! Love this warm scarf with squares!
B00IKCMPJO|4|Mine fit great! Horns stood upjust fine.
B000Q7B1DC|3|Could be a little bigger to remain in place<br />Ain
B000A3I3OW|5|A good high quality jacket.
B00NXYW4V8|5|Love the shirt!  Ordered it for myself, and it fits perfectly and looks great!  I love wearing it out and seeing how many people get it, it's a great conversation starter!
B00EUXZNVE|2|I love how cute these are but they ripped on their own the first day I wore them, right where the black meets the nude. Overall they're really cute and fashionable I would just think about buying a different pair because I was extremely disappointed that they ripped.
B00TA6SE8A|4|Best workout pants ever<br />Wash well<br />Fit great I have bought several pair
B00ME43Z8Y|5|Excellent!
B00963N8TC|4|We had this hysterical idea for my husband to dress as Optimus Prime and for me to be a bumblebee.  Not THE Bumblebee, just a bumblebee.  So, I went to work trying to find the best bee costume.  I landed on this one.  It seemed cute and flattering, but not so inappropriate that I would be frightened to show photos to my aged relatives.  So here's the quick summary:  it is set up to fit most people pretty well, it is pretty cute in person, but there are a variety of little flaws you may want to be aware of.<br /><br />1.  It has lots of elastic bands around the chest, so it makes it easy to fit and stay on.  Add the tie for the halter top, and it makes it an easy fit for most people.<br />2.  The chest is still pretty small.  It fits, it just could look better.<br />3.  The lace work in the middle is NOT adjustable.  So if the waist is too big (and it was for me) there is nothing to be done.<br />4.  The black edges on the hips bulge out in kind of weird way.  I wore a ruffly petticoat and that still did not help soften the strange bulges.<br />5.  The wings and antenna are different than those shown.  The wings were cute, but I did leave a trail of gold glitter behind me.  The antenna were pipe cleaners with little puff balls and a little pathetic.  However, not shown was the bee wand (?).  Yeah, bee wand.  A ribbon covered stick with a glittery bee at the end.  Must be the queen bee's royal scepter.<br />6.  The bee purse was actually a decent size, and so I was able to carry my phone and lip gloss with me (and I probably could have carried quite a bit more).  I would not have ever thought to get one, but it was nice since it was included.<br />7.  The words Queen Bee in the center of the chest light up.  It's a blinking light and a little funny.<br /><br />So overall, it's a little short and quite flirty and pretty fun.  I got a lot of compliments and I really felt like I made the best bee choice, but hopefully this can help you decide is this is the best you canbee.  (Sorry, bee puns are too fun with this costume.)
B000RUJJAU|5|High quality and a great fit (once you're done drooling over a counter for thirty minutes). I probably was way too pleased with the fact that the outer clamshell packaging wasn't the kind you have to cut open and bloody your hands ripping apart. The little coffin case is cute and a perfect storage place until you use the fangs again.
B00793OCIC|5|This is exactly what I was looking for to protect me from the sun. I have an allergy to the sun so I need something that I can wear every time I leave the house all spring and summer. This is so light and cool that it doesn't make me overheat and it looks good too. It fits great and the sleeves are a little long so they cover most of my hands which for me is a bonus for even more protection from the sun. Looking forward to staying cool and protected this year.
B00BRGZ8VM|5|All I can say is....buy it! This bikini top has incredible support and is absolutely adorable. I paired it with high rise bikini bottoms for a lovely vintage look. The straps are adjustable and it's a tie-back so you can make it as tight or loose as you want (aka no back fat). I wear a 34 D in Victoria's Secret and the 34-36 C/D fit perfectly.
B00EFEOTO0|5|Love it!
B00V715FW4|5|It looks so elegant ! Highly satisfied!!!
B00I0GFJHK|5|I love this mask. It is exactly what I expected. Only slight adjustments were needed to fit the face. Really beautiful.
B0088O3FUC|3|My husband said that they arent strong enough for what he needs. He is a tall man, workks on horses as a ferrier,and is bent over alot. He had some Y back suspenders years ago that he loved but I havent been able to find them anywhere, was hoping these were similar but they arent built for what he needs. They smell toxic for awhile when you take them out of package.
B00ACIFZ1Y|1|i ware L size but this is too big on me
B0079L821C|3|I ordered the purple but i got the blue. Also the package was delayed due to carrier issue.
B00ELPZK0U|5|I am very pleased with the quality of the tee shirt.  The material feels good against the skin and the seams are well done.  I was unsure whether I needed a large or extra large.  It's been my experience that one should order one size larger if the tee shirt is of questionable quality.  In this case I ordered large assuming the garment was of good quality.  I was right and it fits fine.
B00DQYOMJ2|5|Great lightweight rain jacket for the money.  Not for heavy use in brushy areas or for cold weather unless you layer underneath. Order one size larger for a good fit.  It will keep you nice and dry--that's what counts
B001NTZAQG|5|I received my order very quickly. The tie was excellent quality and looked exactly like the picture on the website. For the price, I was very pleased with my purchase.
B00AL11QRY|5|This is just right!  My son loves it.  I think he will use as a towel after a shower at camp.
B008B81LP6|5|Great simply way to make the Wonder Woman costume work.  Have paired the shirt with red gogo boots, a WW tiara, and pair of WW cuffs.  So fun!  Shirt is well-made and seems true to size.
B00FXHB32E|5|Very fast shipping, the wallet is very cute!😄<br />My cat also enjoys the box 🐱📦
B00JUP45Y8|4|Lots of ironing needed. otherwise a nice fit and great color
B006STXRAW|4|Nice dress for the holiday season. It is a bit thin material-wise so it was hard to wear appropriate undergarments. It is a dress that will show every flaw, so have a great body or be prepared to suck it in all night ladies!
B00GT08R0A|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Very good quality - they should last forever - and you get a ton of them, which is good cause my friends steal them and I usually forget and leave them when I go to the cleaners.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00GBJGQSY|5|well made. a lot of fun
B00NO3LI06|5|The cut of this top is gorgeous!  Incredibly flattering on my figure 8 shape, I just wish the fabric was better quality but I love it enough that I will buy another one when it wears out.
B002J9T6RI|4|These are pretty.  They turn on and off easily but I would put the plastic piece back between the batteries between uses.
B00K0F2W8I|5|They sent me a small instead of medium; however, it worked out in my favor. I'm 5 foot, 135 pounds and it fit in all the right places. The top is big for being a small though, as I am a 36c.
B00E1J0PUQ|4|I'm still deciding if I'll keep these...simply bc of the back pockets. When I slipped them on, I initially was VERY happy with them.  Loved the look from the front.  But then I did a 180 to check out the review and my happiness plummeted.  These have those sorts of pockets that sort over overlap onto your thigh.  It's just not cute, in my opinion.  I do appreciate that the pockets are large and the stitching on them is nice, but the placement is unflattering.  (I do have a definite badonkadonk, so those with smaller bums may have a different experience.)<br /><br />With that said, I do think the quality of the denim in Dollhouse jeans is consistently good.  It's heavy but not too heavy, and just the right ratio of stiffness-to-stretch.  I really liked the color and the stitching; both look sharp. As said above, I was really happy with them until I took a look from the back.  They're cute, except the pockets.  But there are a few other things worth mentioning: sizing and ankle looseness.<br /><br />As for fit, I'm unsure about the consistency of sizing in the Dollhouse brand. I have another pair of Dollhouse jeans, size 5, which are slightly snug (I've only worn those a few times, btw, so I don't think they are stretched out).  So, I ordered a 7 in these.  However, I think the fit of these 7's is basically the same as the 5's.<br /><br />The skinny on the skinny:  Not really skinny.  I didn't expect these to fit like jeggings, but I do feel the ankle area is a little loose for skinny jeans.  I do have skinny ankles, so these may be perfect for someone without skinny ankles or who doesn't want truly form fitting skinny jeans.  I think these fit like a cross between skinny jeans and straight leg jeans.
B00COK3BBE|3|I actually ordered the correct size, but did not print the order for proof. I received the wrong size for all three pair.
B00A65Z5JU|5|Adorable shirt and excellent fit.
B005X2QHWK|5|fits the bill; looks good; wears nice
B00R44K9K6|2|just looks OK. Good good for teen girls.
B002R0FGH8|5|This suit is extremely well made. We will be ordering another one when my daughter outgrows it. Couldn't be more pleased.
B00B89PXYA|2|Not well made, size is a question....sent it back.
B0058Z8AYU|2|The seller recommended sizing down because these jeans run large.  These jeans were too small so I returned them for the next waist size up.  I would say they are true to size.
B00GGQFBGK|5|The best socks, great fit and awesome style.
B00KAB4V72|5|I love this shirt. It is roomie and moves freely. The arm holes are a nice size. Often times the arm holes in larger sizes are huge and half your beast is exposed. Not the case with this shirt. Great fit.
B001KP200C|5|this cloak worked great for our mascarade party, my husband is 6ft and it fit well. would recommend to all
B007HCAEKU|4|I love this dress overall!  Pros:  Soft and flowy drape, low back style, think can wear casual or dress up.  Cons:  Runs a little large (but I guess that can be expected considering size is S/M) and a little bit on the sheer side so undergarments challenging.
B001AXAGU0|3|You get what you pay for with these but they get the job done. Careful when you place your order though, I thought I was getting black but ordered red on accident. It was my fault but just double check your order.
B00CDY7TPK|3|Dress is nicer in person that in the photo - fabric is unique and looks expensive. Unfortunately the sleeves were so tight that even though the rest of the dress fit (it was even a little big), I couldn't get it on all the way. Back zipper would also be hard to fully zip without someone's help. If you have any sort of shoulder muscle this will probably be too tight.
B008R6TN5W|5|product is of good quality. Received actually as pictured and described in write up. Arrived on time and boxed extremely well. ffit perfect and wash well.
B00J5XGO6M|5|Thank you
B0108JYJ18|1|Don't know who it was suppose to fit..would. ot even fit my 9 year old niece. Donated it to Goodwill
B00AFRQ8HM|3|I really like this swimsuit from the front. The ruching and neckline work wonderfully to create an hourglass shape. I would agree that, from the front, I do look thinner wearing it (size 10).  However, there's nothing going on in the back; no ruching and it is just solid color and goes very high up the body. I think it is very, very unflattering.  I wish they had designed the swimsuit to have ruching all over, or at least have a color block in the back or some sort of design component. I will probably be sending this one back as I will not feel comfortable wearing it.
B0050AFZ64|5|It is just like i expected . Same as in pisture good quality and a good for all seasons . I like the colour and fast delivery of the item thank you guys.
B0000ZCE1I|3|I really like these undies because they are so soft and breathable.  They don't move around, they stay in place.  They do show a panty line, but that doesn't bother me so much.<br /><br />The thing that bothers me is that out of four pairs, one of them had a bad seam that pinches and pokes.  I called jokey and they replaced it for free.  I ordered about 6 more, and another one had the same issue.  So, I'm okay with the ones I have that don't pinch, but I wouldn't risk buying more.
B00EZO7V5Y|4|For a fraind gift
B00D1R820O|1|Quality is not good
B003HMEICO|4|good prices fast deliver looks good been nice if it had a print on the back to,would gave this a 5 if it had a print on the back.
B00ZOU42KK|1|These pants are entirely too small- not true to size at all. What is more disappointing is they look NOTHING like the picture- they design is not nearly as bright and vibrantly colored. In addition, the sewing is not professionally done at all. The crotch was sewn completely incorrectly and the waist band is not a &#34;fold over waistband&#34; as described.
B0096NCIQG|5|Keep their shape and color after multiple washings
B002R5A4SY|5|Jefferies socks are great quality. It's hard to find nice lace trim socks in stores, but these are adorable. They &#34;complete&#34; and dress up several outfits for my child.
B000A38CNO|5|My DH works outside, and these are great! This is his third pair, and they really do help alot in the cold. Plus they're made well, the seams hold up, and the knees haven't worn through. A great product!
B002GT0E54|4|These are really nice work shirts but do run a bit big.
B005NRPIYS|5|True to size, very soft my daughter loves this pullover to throw on after her gymnastics' classes. Likes this shade of purple too. Item still feels soft after washing.
B00T8JVVS4|5|All right!
B00DE194TK|5|Form fitting, flexible, utilitarian, stylish.  Everything I was looking for; I'm quite satisfied.
B00936UHEG|3|Color not really accurate to picture
B005PJ1ANC|5|It's very good and really fits me very well. And the quality is also good.
B000TFFPGK|5|This is a great sock.  I'm generally a fan of Wigwam, but this is my favorite sock for running.  Very durable and well made, and I like the availability of the X-large size (difficult to find at brick & mortar stores).
B0002UCES4|3|it works fine in suppressing tummy, but cannot wear under clothes because the flap left out is bulgy
B00GKCA4OE|4|A bit thinner than my other shorts but great color...normally wear a 6/8 and the six is a tad big but doable.
B00N6MSAXS|5|I got this product early and I was excited. I got a large so it would be a little lose. It fits perfect everywhere but the arms. Might want to go a size bigger if you order it but it is worth it! Very cute shirt, I love it!!
B0038OZPTG|5|I love this top
B003DZWVOC|5|I think that this nursing bra runs a little larger than some other brands. That said, this is a very nice, sturdy bra. It isn't the one to choose if you want to feel sexy, but that isn't exactly the main function of a nursing bra anyway. I was concerned about the clip and being able to hook it with one hand. It took a little practice, but it is possible. The hook feels very secure. I like the smoothness of the material this bra is made from. I prefer nursing bras that don't have material all around  when the clip is undone, but this is a very comfortable and supportive bra.
B00DQD6688|4|Returned this dress too big in the midsection and I just didn't like how the burnt orange (not coral) looked, I am very petite so it is not the company's fault for that but I didn't like how to fabric of the skirt looked<br /><br />Other wise, great service, I was immediately refunded for my order, would shop with stanzio again
B0067SMT4O|4|Very nice suit. For my girl who is almost 3 years it was a little big. Otherwise is very good. She is no longer shivering after her swimming classes.
B00LKW2RQC|5|Good product
B00NNBRL5U|5|Excelente
B004RLJA4A|3|Maybe I expected too much but It only pulled in a half inch all around, I was expecting more.  This is my first time ever purchasing a product like this but it does smooth you out which I like.  Doesn't take long to get use to the slit.  I also wanted to mention I purchased a smaller size too to see if it would pull me in more and it was the same half an inch around and still not uncomfortable to be in.
B00STX3OLW|2|This item run small ..
B003IHWMYO|5|Is made of precisely the same material as my bikini bottoms, provides excellent coverage and the built-in bra can stand up to all-day swimming without giving up the ghost.
B00WL8QXPU|1|Fits small.  Material is very scratchy. Straps come out Very easily.
B008YD9DNK|4|Design is pretty nice, not sure it will last much since materials seem to be average quality but price was good!
B00D2KF55A|5|Soft and colorful. I bought a few colors and sizes for my boys and love them, very nice fit and feel!
B00AI7DKRK|5|i am loving the color and design its very stylish..
B00FEPWQJY|5|Beautiful dress!
B00L3KOY9Y|4|Very light, and airy pants. Perfect for summer, in my opinion.<br />Fit well, Button will need to be sewn better, but the price is right.
B00MTVNJ9M|4|Very Warm socks, Good Price quality ratio.<br />They can not fight my wet feet. Although, 100% difference compared to regular cotton socks.
B000GKUGBW|5|absolute the best love it and plan on buying more
B0024X9HP0|5|Beautiful patch!
B00793OZY8|1|The lenses are not Okley. They are fake and definitely not polarized. I tried to wipe them clean and the mirrored color on the outside of the lens came off. I don't even know why they are under the Okley products. Terrible, just terrible....
B000TD5KSA|5|I had Skinny Tees on hold with QVC, and by the time I paid shipping for two of them, while the price was better than most places including here, it was still going to be $45 for two by the time I paid shipping.  And I really only needed a white one for now, so I decided to come to Amazon and take a look. Full Tilt had a lot of good reviews and the price was right. so I ordered. I'm a Prime member, so I didn't have to contend with shipping costs, and it came today.  Just exactly what I wanted.  It's not flimsy at all, it comes down to my mid-thigh, it doesn't roll up at all, the straps, although they can't be adjusted, are fine as far as length, overall a great purchase.  I'll be back for other colors.
B0049W2YZO|5|Fits perfect my husband is 6'1 and 155 lbs and it fits perfect although I would suggest if you were thicker go a size up because its long and slim which is why it was a excellent purchase for me.
B004UQE2GI|3|Runs way too small.
B00933XTF8|5|Great workout shorts.
B00EZZCAFO|5|Kevin loves it
B00J3B0MEG|5|hermoso buena calidad me fascinan los recomiendo
B00ESGEAN0|5|Gorgeous and smooth
B000KJ51V4|5|Very cool, easy to tighten, stay tight.  I have them on my pool running shoes but plan to buy another pair for my running shoes.
B00C9NC7PW|5|Very nice shirt. I got the matching snapback. The quality is really nice and it fits true to size. I like this shirt a lot.
B00ITO5LLM|5|Thanks
B00PNSNEBG|2|Great Customer Service and communication from seller. Love the look and presentation of tags (bought the 2-pack in color red). The &#34;wires&#34; that attach the tags are very sturdy. After only one roundtrip flight (Domestic with 1 layover each way) both tags bent and scratched (since we had ordered the red color the silver scratches really showed). Unfortunately I had to return. Can not recommend the red color which I believe is made of a different material than the silver steel tags. Bummed out, was really excited to use these and they definitely look great and are east to id your luggage.
B000SMZ9BU|5|I bought this bra for my wife and she loves it.  Sorry I can't give a first person review.  But, my wife says it supports well, fits great and is comfortable.
B0017VX6IO|4|This does the job, but even the 2&#34; midriff band tends to roll up on my scars. Overall, would recommend this product.
B0072D8B04|4|I normally wear a XXL.  But some shirts, after a half dozen washings or so, start to become a bit of a crop top.  So I figured I'd go one size up to try an avoid that with this shirt since it has some really nice screen printing on it.  I wanted it to last and fit well for a long time.<br /><br />3XL is a LOT larger than a 2XL.  But it's also a lot LONGER.  I'm wearing a freaking dress.  LOL
B00GU57WWI|4|This shirt comes as a very good value for money.
B008XD4UNO|4|The jacket is beautiful, soft, supple, well taylored but unfortunately, ran small.  I had to return it because of this.  I tried to order the next size and it was not available...
B0018ON5M2|2|The waist is at least 2 inches larger than other pairs I own.  It's a reminder of why I try clothes on before buying.
B005EGRP8A|4|It looks great on a pair of jeans
B00SIP8RPO|3|Material is nt so good and shorts are way too flare
B00Q8IYJZU|5|Love this
B005XLTIQI|4|These fit well for a woman of 65 and a little fuller body type.  They are comfortable too and look great with long tops.
B004J0DU0Y|5|Excellent fit and workmanship.  Very thin, as I required, but not fragile.  Yes, you can manipulate keys and firearms, as well as pick up coins while wearing these (the classic test).  They somewhat resemble black latex gloves from a distance but glove aficionados will ask you where you got them (one actually grabbed my hand and inhaled repeatedly -- no, I'm not making this up...).  Well worth the $.
B00KDB8RVA|1|Does not allow returns
B009A116Z8|4|This style of belt is great.  I've been wearing them for around 15 years now.  I took a star off as Mission claims this is new.  They've actually been available in Asia for a long time.  The plastic does break if you bend it too far but that tends to happen when someone doesn't like the belt rather than normal wear and tear.
B00DGZJPPW|1|Ink started to wear off after a couple of uses.
B00D7UXYYE|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B003TQL2X6|4|i liked it and it looked very cute but it was kinda itchy after a while. looked adorable on and was perfect for my buttercup the power puff girl costume
B00JQ67ELW|2|Way to large of range here
B0051XP3X0|4|Good stuff!
B00O5UNOV8|5|Nice
B00EM8HUCM|4|It fitted well and looks good. Pleased with purchase
B001R52JW4|1|I ordered this hat from Blockbuster off of Ebay and it is NOT stuffed or plush.  It is a flat hat that is made of felt pieces sewn together.  Blockbuster told me I was being picky and would not work with me!!
B00IWMD8O8|5|Beautiful love them and fit great i'm 5'5&#34; about 125-130lbs
B00JOMN1YW|4|Fit really well at first but after first washing the elastic in the waist started to give and they stared slipping. Other than that I still love them! Just have to readjust every once in a while!
B00A6SAV7I|5|Super comfy!
B007JL0UY4|5|Got this for my husband and it is a very nice sweater.  He wears it often and really  likes it, too.
B00G0W1L82|5|Great fit!!
B00MVQMT0A|3|I loved it except i got it with ine of the straps broken:(
B00EK94PQ2|4|Soft and fits well.  Sleeve were a little long but cute. Definitely going to order more items
B00GB7KV6E|4|Love it it's a little big though
B00KB1AJP4|3|This dress is somewhat see through and runs a little small.  I usually am a small or medium.  I ordered the medium and it just fits.  It also is a very straight cut so you can't walk fast in it.
B00M4BUQP2|5|Great fit, great service...
B000783SCW|5|I wish I had tried them a long time ago.Put on expecting bad results and they were GREAT.Will buy more
B00A10HLE2|3|Nice graphic but material is thin.  I have bought 3 of the Doctor Who tees and this one is the thinest.
B00J50953Y|5|I was extremely pleased with the quality of this shirt and especially for the great price with the company I bought from.
B002B96SRC|4|very nice, as advertised
B008BNN95G|4|I was surprised that a large was too small.  I returned same and ordered extra large.  Shirt fits very nice  I will order more when in need.
B005DAI59K|4|It fit as though it was designed for someone around 5'9, but at 6'3 i was able to hike it up.  It was a bit tight but it served it's purpose and i was the most stunning male Mama June from Honey Boo Boo in NYC on Halloween.
B002SBCHYQ|5|Love it
B00TR9PH4Y|5|Quality and sexy.
B00N1MU1E4|3|Super small jacket. My wife loves it tho.
B00M8EMBPI|5|Adorable love the fit and the colors
B00INIWEW8|5|Very comfortable and great quality.
B00G2QKM36|5|Size seemed somewhat large, but after washing fits fine. Material is soft and the fit is very comfortable.
B00BUSRM70|3|Like all the glitter infant clothes I've bought before, the glitter gets everywhere!  I don't know why we lack the technology to keep the glitter on the clothes.  I didn't understand that this had glitter all over the shirt, otherwise I would not have bought it.<br /><br />The head opening is super small for the 12 month size.  I won't be able to tug it over my 7 month old's head pretty soon.  It's a struggle now.  The pants are also super small.  The fabric stretches so much on her that the flowers on the pants look faded and misshapen.  She's a big baby but not so big that she doesn't fit into a 12 month size.  The outfit is cute.  Just size up and I hope you like glitter!
B003MWEIYC|5|I'm 67 and experience swelling in my ankles and feet as the day wears on. I cannot say with any certainty that the tight fitting socks I'm accustomed to are 100 % the cause, but they certainly aggravate the condition.<br /><br />When my order of these socks arrived I immediately installed a pair on my swollen ankles and feet. Within 2 hours the swelling was gone and I could once again see the veins in the top of my feet. The socks hug the calf of my leg with just barely enough pressure to keep them up. The seam across the toe does not annoy in the least. I immediately returned to Amazon and ordered 9 more packages (18 pair).<br /><br />There are a few products in this world that can be described as approaching perfection because they fill a need or solve a problem so well. These socks certainly fit that description for me, and by way of preemptively answering the  cynical among the readers of these reviews: no, I'm not compensated by anyone for saying so.
B00F52LWAK|4|material it was at  expected, it is really good and warm and confortable to wear , i will buy the again if necesary
B007HJG36M|5|I love this sports bra for low impact exercise. It's very comfortable and I really like the wrap fit. I'm buying another in a different color.
B00LGDZKZ0|1|Horrible! Do not buy. This can not even be considered a swimsuit. It has no lining and is completely see through. I would suspect that it would fall apart on first wear but I won't find out because I won't let my daughter wear it.
B00FIYULRU|5|I am 6'1&#34; and I ordered a XL and it fits perfectly. This would probably fit large on an average height and size woman.  It would be wise to order down if your not a large person. I wear a size 16 in tall clothing, so I am rather large and it still fit perfectly.  The sleeves are about 3/4 length. The material is very sturdy and it's made well.  Even with the stretching because of my body size and type this suit is still opaque.  The seller is wonderful as my order was lost in transit, and they immediately reshipped. Wonderful item and seller. I highly recommend.
B0007ULYV2|2|I LOVED these when I bought them, they fit great, they have great traction, especially for being flip-flops, and they had a soft fit that was wonderful to walk in!  But after my first day, I noticed the bottoms of my feet turning black!  And it hasn't gone away, no matter how long I wear them they leave the soles of my feet a horrible black.  I'm going to write Skechers and ask for a refund or exchange.  Don't buy these, go for another color!
B00TKP8332|3|The suit runs small but it seems to be good quality. I am sad to be returning it.
B00W3OYI1I|5|very nice
B0065Q5WI8|5|I love these bras! If you are looking for light support and comfort, this is the bra for you!  Reasonably priced too.  I won't wear anything else.
B00OSS00QY|5|It is a lovely dress. Perfect for work or church. The fit is very flattering.
B00PIW2332|5|A+
B00E201IIC|3|Material is a little thin, but the pattern is nice.
B00D82YTDG|4|So far this jacket is working out nicely although, the zipper does stick just a touch. Overall, it's exactly what I expected. It works great for fall weather and winter weather provided you're not skiing or sledding.  My boys play hard outside and tend to get hot. Last year my son chronically  took off his big puffer jacket and  we'd end up having to put two sweat shirts on him to keep him from gettng cold.  This jacket is just right for a few hours of outside play. My son doesn't get too hot so he keeps it on. He also likes that it's not a huge puffy jacket which makes playtime easier. I like the fleece material on the inside for added warmth but I wouldn't recommend using the reversable function because the fleece doesn't wipe off easily. Othan that it's a cute jacket and serves its purpose well..
B008G6P2KI|5|Very nice pocket inside the left side of the vest.  Very nice for concealed carry of a small gun.
B00NMGTGH2|4|perfect
B00OME4TKC|5|These tanks are perfect length for layering or wearing with leggings. They are good quality for the price. I bought these close to almost a year ago and I still wear them. 2 are ripped a little, but the other 2 are still going strong! Want to purchase more in the future!
B00BMZ69O8|5|Now this one fit
B002MQA6K4|4|liked the hat
B002DGIEO8|5|Awesome
B003XU76AG|5|The soft, thick, cushiony foot in these socks cradles your tired feet.    It's a little mini-vacation for your feet.
B00K892W9A|1|I did not think that One Size is going to be that big. More like an Extra large
B00AYZC95U|5|Nice thick quality. Really good value. I'll order more for sure.
B00475JKTQ|2|Not as expected.
