B005992QKO|4|They do what they are supposed to do. Like other locks of a similar design they do seem a little on the flimsy side. Not sure if they would hold up to corrosive salt exposure in the Northeast long term.
B0002YPD7O|5|Just as described.
B008DREON6|5|Great buy , fit very well . Would recommend
B00G620ZVU|5|Good price for a good product
B00GSE86CQ|5|The most difficult part is disassembling the OEM key fob. Once you get it apart (with a razor blade to cut the glue), everything fits in this new device exactly as advertised.  HOWEVER, this does not save you from have get the new key cut.  While everything looks the same, the slots on the OEM key and this do not match up so you can't just use the old key with the new cover.  Everything else works just fine.  Should take you less than an hour...just be patient when cutting the OEM device apart....the glue is really good.
B00PJ3ACOW|4|Nice quality sticker, good size.
B003VLBPJA|5|Nice quality product
B003WRW5XI|4|I've used all the bed liners available a half dozen times each.  Rock-it and the Raptor product both work great.  The stuff out of Canada had poor coverage and sprayed in chunks
B000CMDCKQ|5|Got rear ended on my way to work this morning.  This bar completely saved my truck! No damage at all.  Bar is destroyed but for $80 dollars it's a no brainer to have it.  Another idiot texting and driving!
B0029TQDLA|5|fast shipment , arrived as described
B00CU4C8E0|5|Fits well easy to put up and take down.
B00UCTY6UY|5|Best quality mats I've gotten in 17 years!!!  you have a new faithful customer. Thanks!
B00KS5JJ4A|5|Has to be the best Wheel cleaner I have ever used!<br />Product was recommended by a detailer and it did not disappoint .
B00ELJ9A3O|5|put these things everywhere relevant!!
B00HL9ERWU|5|Ez to install if u add baby oil
B000OSX2YY|3|Well made jacket, but the sizing chart is wrong and the jacket was too small.
B001D6HLBG|5|Great Job!
B00I2500UA|5|Great fender! Had to shorten side mounts for my Springer to fit, no big deal. May buy again for another bike. Nice thick metal.
B00EJFH6YA|5|Yup!!!...its bright n solid materials!
B000BUU5YU|5|It works.  Thanks!
B000BUU5YU|5|Good price and quality.
B00PMMGR9E|5|Love this informant definitely worth every penny
B00EANHCNQ|1|UPDATE: I have had this replaced twice now and they still are breaking! DO NOT BUY if you actually fall off the jetski!  it looks great! This one seems to work but the first one pulled apart the first big fall I had and the jetski was running without a driver. CHECK IT BEFORE YOU RIDE!
B013GA1XUQ|5|Easy install, durable plastic material, looks good
B000HEBR3I|5|Showed up on time and works great
B0087NB0ZQ|5|Great product.  Use it all the time.  Well made.  Durable.  Upgradeable firmware.  Highly recommend when on motorcycle
B006LW94RG|5|Perfect fit and priced right
B004FFLEJW|5|very good ! I like it!
B002ERYXNC|2|Yes it does its job and worked out fine but the bar was bent or warped and required an extra hour at installation. Turned out to be a costly issue.
B00A881BY8|5|keeps bed sealed and dry. like the added security of having metal behind the leather. fits 2014 dodge ram great
B002DU3S9A|5|Great product
B0068C2VW4|4|Look good and fit well.
B003SGJIRO|1|This is a POS (piece of s***). It does not stay in the cigarette lighter.
B000M5Z5WQ|5|Excellent product and great seller to work with!
B00XQD4UI6|5|Love them. They lay exactly the way I want!
B00CFCHSZG|5|Nice
B00HV0SEVO|3|Did not fit my car even though it was rated for it.Really liked them,wished they would have fit.
B00144D77E|1|great product awesome price very fast shipper!
B00JIJ4LWW|4|I used the product to clean ink from a red leather wallet. With a little elbow grease, the product worked well to remove all of the ink spots without discoloring the leather.
B00Z9X7TDO|1|Terrible Black finish washes right off!
B007IU7YQ8|5|Looks rugged and makes my truck look mean! Perfect fit! Easy to install!
B00HZTV13Y|5|Absolutely thriled to have two remotes again. Works like a new remote. I would buy from this place again with no worries.
B0006IX87S|4|Purchased this for washing the car this summer; attached to my garage hose. We have hard well water in a rural area and this unit did the trick as best as I could ask with almost no spots after towel drying. Car stays cleaner longer too. Will buy again.
B00CB8WM2S|5|Very good product needed in Florida.
B0033DH98C|5|I replaced this months ago and no issues yet. This is not an entry level repair but I managed just fine with a Haynes book and this kit.
B00IK025M8|5|Fast shipping quality is goid
B0009I4U1S|5|PLUG and play here videos on line were perfect to help with install
B00076RLB8|5|Fit my 2004 Dodge Ram perfectly. Installed in less than half and hour.
B0002SRCMO|5|Worked very well for removing the stubborn plastic fasteners that were broken.
B00XZ9ONA6|5|Dealership wanted almost $200- to replace one that was lost. Locksmith wanted $125-. (Locksmith offered to program it for me for $50- when she realized I was going to shop at Amazon.) I got it in and programed it in maybe 2 minutes. As far as if it will last as long as a factory replacement, I have no idea, but for the difference in price you can replace these once a year and still have money left over. Mine was for a 2010 Chevy Traverse with the entertainment center.
B001UEHLV6|5|Perfect
B003UYYGWQ|4|like original straps.
B00KLJUZ5K|5|Perfect, worked great
B00XNS9PFW|5|Great product fit and finish was perfect .
B00WDSVEE8|4|These work for me.  Don't get glare I think others indicated.  Dimension description was accurate.  Easy to clip on.  No distortion.  Very slightly out of focus, barely noticable.  Glad to have it.
B00CFJT6AE|5|I had the code for the leak (I forget the code). I found that it was $225 from VW for a whole new valve cover, or $140 online. I then found the Dorman part.<br /><br />I had to break the old cap to remove it, but upon removal I found that it did have a rip in it.<br /><br />New one snapped on, reset error code and now the car runs fine
B00EP3PUV2|5|Fit perfectly and were super easy to install.
B00993MQ6K|5|Awesome
B000JFHNG0|4|Good for the home doer
B0084O11YI|5|When I saw it I liked it but now I liked it even more. Looks good on the window.
B0013REXO8|5|Love the look and the install process took 5 minutes.
B002ZTKBJO|5|Great design and fit. If you can, you should purchase them!  Not a necessity, but they are well designed and fit perfectly.
B0009V1WS4|5|I really like the ability to secure my hitch since the Uhaul folks put the electrical connection box too close for a normal lock
B00QJBLF5S|3|Pretty good, had an issue linning it up. My fault. Only real complaint is it took a long time to recieve it.
B00F673O7S|5|Very good result
B007PLZGO2|5|Perfect Just as described. Gotten a few laughs outta it. ;)
B00332GNDK|5|I have had these on for nearly two weeks now.  They were very easy to install and look great on my 2005 Excursion.
B0000AY4YT|5|Working on the boat hull.<br />I haven't waxed yearly as I should so there is some light oxidation.<br />Lots of work but the three step process will give your boat a hull to be proud of.
B004UB4704|5|simply the best. fresh REAL scent covers ALL odors.
B000C5O1VW|5|Worked perfectly as a replacement for my Honda Harmony mower
B000OAG2DK|5|Definitely a nice upgrade to he stock rv shower
B001UFQBAM|5|I used them for filtering some gasoline that had become contaminated by a dirty gas can and it worked great.
B000BUQOEK|5|Though we have yet to try these,but for storage and convenience, they are worth a try. The RV dealership recommended this product and other reviews have agreed. We will also be looking to try the liquid version and then competitors.
B00JBICJ2O|5|If you are looking for an awesome replacement for the stock headlights, or just want to make your Eclipse look badass don't even think about it.  Buy these headlights you will not regret it. I love them!  Simple plug and play four main lights led halos and strip need to be wired into the turn signal very easy if you've ever installed a radio
B0009IBJAS|5|Very versatile and easy to use. Does a great job....I own 4 of them !!
B003SYLN1A|5|Fits perfectly
B001KS86VQ|5|ok
B00700E8QA|5|Loved it! had to get one for myself and my Step dad!
B00180I65M|2|They brake, but that is pretty much what all brake pads do. They squeal when cold.
B000GVIP5A|5|Smaller then I thought quality and function is great, but as a oil cooler only seeing 15 degree temp difference.
B00DDOSNH2|5|Before I installed these in the trailer, I measured the voltage drop from 1 incandescent. After I installed these, it took 10 of them to be on to equal the voltage drop from 1 incandescent. Now I can turn every light in the trailer on, and only use the power of 1 of the old bulbs. Great for boondocking!
B004SRM2Q6|4|Snaps are the weak link in this product - literally & figuratively! Le Bra is wonderful until the fastners begin to wear out - - especiallt when driving at highway speeds and they let go so the Bra flaps your front end until you can safely exit to pull off and remove it to save your paint from damage.  Really adds to look of the vehicle, but it becomes a crap shoot for length of viability.
B0049CGJAU|5|This fit what my husband wanted it for.  It fit very well.
B005O01NPW|5|It was the perfect fit and it came with good directions on the installation. It's only been on the car a few days, but so far, so good.
B009DIX92Q|4|good quality
B002QOYS42|2|ok
B004QJISMI|5|Worked perfectly, exact fit
B0082X2R30|5|Have used it along with the same one we purchased for my wife.  Very comfortable
B000XY6XMM|5|Great pegs. Beefy.<br />Pictures don't represent product quality adequately.
B001C4SLEU|4|Great once it's in but the 3 hour install sucked. Directions were spotty and I had a lot of extra parts left over. I can definitely notice a power increase and it sounds awesome!
B00CT2XYAK|1|This does not fit a honda fit 2013, despite what the amazon garage configurator says. Super bummed.
B000VJPVJK|5|It does the job of cleanning the chains ez to used
B00ROS4QAG|5|Easy to mount. These lights are just what I was expecting. I've had no problems so far and they look awesome.
B00AVM79SS|1|Ordered orange and was sent gold. Being color blind I proceeded to touch up the entire vehicle thinking it would lighten once it dried. Not only that the product came in a plain container and the paint was thinned so much it took 15 coats to even get coverage. It was like painting with water, it was insane. Then when my wife came home she said as soon as she walked in the door, &#34;why did you paint gold dots all over your truck?&#34;  I threw the leftover &#34;paint&#34; across the street. Don't order from the Bumper Store unless you want thinned paint that doesn't match your vehicle. Chalk it up to not reading reviews and another color blind story to be told over and over again. Time to trade the truck in now I guess.
B00GSAUHB8|2|According to the product image shown with the BMW SUV, i thought it will fit perfectly with my own BMW but it is way too small and flops down because of that.
B00CU7HXI8|4|Great jacket until you start to look at it really closely, then you notice the stitching is off here and there with a lot of tiny little woopsies and less than perfect alignment.
B004PQOT8Y|5|Came fast, fit well. Im very pleased.
B00URNQ126|3|not really worth it for what you get, almost like you could make something like it out of a coat hanger
B009MATHQ2|5|Great product
B009DIXU66|5|Great product, work exactly the same as the expensive brand.  Works perfectly in my Jeep Liberty.  Update:  Have had the product for months and haven't had any issues, I take it out every few months and wash it and works great.
B00K884CIA|5|Great product, have installed on my Jeep Liberty<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />After a few months the product is still great.  Have thrown tools in the back and other heavy stuff and no issue.
B00KMULLY2|5|Nicely constructed socket - robust enough to likely hold up to an impact wrench if you were in such a predicament. Worked great for removing the screw on filter element for our '15 RAM Ecodiesel!
B000NHSOQC|5|Fits perfectly on standard O2 sensors (22)<br />It looks like it's made from a strong metal so will last for many projects in a future.
B00BCT2P7Y|3|Not very thick metal, not sure I would trust leaving my valuables in it.
B004SVFP8E|4|needs to be about 1/2 inch longer.  I could not position it so that I did not have a gap at either the front or the tailgate.  based on the way they seal it, you have to place the rubber gasket as far back as you can or it will not seal to the front bar.<br /><br />installation as easy (have done many covers so I knew what to expect).<br /><br />materal seems good quality but time will tell
B000QV0HV0|5|Used in a 2002 Chevy Astro LS.  Perfect fit.  Quick and easy to install.  Works great.
B00T47KYZ6|4|Moves a good amount of air, low noise,addition of Unique Goods Motor Speed Control made it even better!
B00D38VTTC|5|It fit perfect thanks
B004XTKDQA|5|this worked great. Fits perfectly. Thank you.
B0000AYFTH|5|exactly what I needed and the delivery was fast!
B009XSWRL0|5|Like it very much..
B00B2YE4B4|5|Amazing lights. Using them on my Jeep Liberty.  Looks like daylight.
B00DYSDHCI|5|my miata loves it.
B000VKTUD2|3|This filter is frameless as opposed to the OEM filter. I am concerned that the air will flow around the filter rather than through it.
B004VGAJOG|5|Great product
B0009IR056|5|I have not yet used this filter, but visual inspection shows a very solid rubber gasket around the edge and is much cheaper in price than the Briggs & Stratton version.  My only concern is that this oil filter is built in India but they're required to build to Fram's specification & hopefully it will work out well as a cheaper alternative.
B00B7DQ6GQ|5|Amazing thank you
B00DJBH1TK|5|Couldn't be better !  Purchased four, and gave away three to MINI owner friends.  People get a real chuckle from the decal.
B00GQGWB1S|5|Excellent product. It was worth it
B007R6EIV2|5|Great ventilation but the lens is easily scratched
B00E5OUOCQ|5|The Sunshade works just like advertised I love it and it is super easy to use and to put away is a breeze!  I am extremely happy with this purchase.  The company was fantastic, they even gave me a call to see how I liked my Sunshade.  They were very nice and I love my sunshade!  I couldn't be happier with my purchase!!!
B00GI2CCLO|4|Love the design!!  But not a really good fit to my truck's windshield. Runs a little small for a SUV. Gets the job done.  I'll just be using it in my car instead.
B0013REXO8|2|Looks good. Installs easy. That's about it. Not functional. Unlike others, that mount to the body for support, this screws to the light's plastic housing, and floats from the body. A semi-hard thump, against the gaurd, will crack your light's housing.
B00AYXM4DY|5|This stuff actually works and my second bottle I have purchased. Most as seen on TV don't work but this does!
B003X1GGVK|5|These work perfect on a small block a must have if your running headers!
B000FOWNN8|5|Using in garage in front of washer and dryer. Feels cleaner and definitely easier on back and knees. Defines a space.
B001UR5XCW|3|very useful now a days for travelling.
B001O0VNT2|5|Installed quickly, no squeaking or grinding and plenty of stopping power. Great price and fast shipping, love Amazon!
B003PIZT1O|4|Work perfec for me.
B0057PHC0Y|2|They were east enough to install and seem to work ok. My only complaint is that the output brightness of these indicators are terrible. They are barely visible during the day. At night it's usable. IMO these are not safe to use as OEM replacement units. They need a MUCH higher intensity LED assembly to be more effective. While the price is very low, I would spend the extra money to get units with high intensity LED's. Car drivers barely pay attention to motorcycles as it is. The indicators need to be clearly visible day / night in all conditions. These just aren't bright enough.
B0085KGOH0|1|The part was delivered promptly but a part was missing from the sealed box so we had to purchase that part to make it work.
B009LOS0KS|5|fit perfectly!
B00PQWN5DQ|4|works well. seems to be well built.
B005FYQQIQ|5|Nice padding and easy install.  Looks great
B00XXI3BRK|4|seemed to do the trick.
B0009JRVWC|5|replaced my broken one
B00SAVDQVG|5|No problems so far. Slow to light, but who cares. It's brighter than the 35W with less of a blue tone.
B00DDV2NL2|1|This company has always had terrible soft ware and up dates. I can not download any up dates.
B007Y5SP7E|5|Arrived on time and as described.
B003AYSG5O|5|Super warm and durable. Fit is exact.
B009S9RVSS|5|Love this sticker company!  Great stuff! I am curious about custom &#34;personal&#34; stickers though?.
B000C9N9ZC|5|A++++
B001C955FI|1|If you're forking out $80 because you think these pads won't completely cover you're runs with brake dust, think again. I bought the because I thought they'd keep my black rims clean. I have 3,000 miles on these brakes and they make my wheels look like I super glued some kingsford charcoal briquettes into my calipers.
B00F5MU9MW|5|Works great We took 3 showers in the RV and I would swear we didn't use more than 10 gal. of water total.  You didn't really have to have the water cranked on all the way to get good pressure from the pump. Would have given 5 stars if the hose were a bit more flexible.  Matches all the other fixtures in the trailer.
B00HPXK8E8|4|They were a little smaller than what I wanted but after all they are just valve stem caps.  They do look good as they add to the looks of your wheels and do not over power your rims or tires with too much flair.
B00042KG3A|5|Thank You
B00J9V3JXG|5|Well made and heavy duty.
B000COUMY8|3|the spark plugs is a really good quality but the coi cable it does not match in the distributor cap
B00CGTVCIC|3|Looked nice, but not leather.
B000CKPX7S|4|works good good price
B000CO91FY|5|Worked great for what it was intended for.
B00H8QG8QE|1|Purchased 2 of these from different sellers, both failed in similar ways. Just glad I didn't get pulled over when one turned into a bit of a strobe light, lol. Could be bad luck or a bad batch, not sure.
B00M8GF00Y|5|great
B000IYTB4O|1|its not a original acdelco product my car dosn t work
B000PSMVTA|2|Didn't do a good job covering the patch. It looks worse now.
B000CAUZ5I|5|Thrilled to get this alternator so cheap! Works GREAT!
B00HJ15C88|5|This product is exactly as pictured and described. I love it!
B00K8VQE7Y|4|Looks awesome in my jeep. It's a little rough getting into and out of place. But it's pretty cool. I use my visors to keep it in place.
B00HRHWMJ6|5|fit perfectly
B000UD0CTQ|1|doesn't work, totally pointless tool
B00KWDU5RI|5|great price!
B000CM3GPC|5|As close to the original mirror as you can find. An exact fit and easy installation.
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Perfect in my 2015 Silverado Cargo Lights Center Brake
B000VKPS7Y|5|Good price!
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Great
B00KVVBEWQ|3|Pretty cool device. My first thought, obviously, was, what will this do that my phone wont?<br />The reality is not much....it does give u sani drop stations for the rv enthusiast and camp grounds etc, but wouldn't a phone.<br />It gives u gas prices in ur vicinty, restaraunts, and other places you may be seeking on a trip. all of this,however, can be done with your basic phone apps.<br />the setup is relatively easy. the device will connect with your phone's address book and will even become your phone when in your car. I found that to be pretty cool.  there is no provider setup. it connects with your phone through bluetooth.this would have been a fantastic device about a decade ago. but in this day and age, one has to wonder what demographic this is going for.I find I am using this more as a hands-free device while driving than ia an actual map. battery life is particularly short, so make sure your charger in your car works otherwise you'll only be able to use this for about 15 minutes. so does this do successfully what it says it does? the answer is yes. it provides maps to campgrounds, shops, coffee houses, restaurants, or anything else you may be looking for. it provides a safe and hands-free way of driving which I feel is the best part of this device. is it worth the price tag? with about a thousand apps that do the same exact thing for free I must say no.
B007H9ZSFO|5|I love it.
B000OCH4YO|5|This brush works quite well. The pole is pretty stiff, even extended. I like that it takes standard replacement heads. Does a good job of removing the bugs from my truck camper. It does take a larger bucket, though. I use a plastic mop bucket.
B00K5NWVAE|2|Way too hard.
B01328OJAI|5|well-built nice and heavy and strong
B0087ZCFU8|5|Great long handled #2 phillips for jobs around the house. I recommend it. If you are a technician I would recommend a Snap On ratchet with replaceable tips I use on for 15 years and loved it. This is great for around the house jobs.
B00HLUWLEK|5|About 2 weeks ago, I crashed into a moose going 55 mph, got thrown off my bike and hit my head on the asphalt. This helmet saved me from serious injury or death. It's very comfortable and a great deal for the price. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000V78KOA|5|Works great. Price was  considerably less than the last rack I bought of an OEM BMW roof rack
B00VVWZ9JI|4|Overall it is good.
B00GY18A3I|5|Quick delivery fits great
B005I5UAJI|5|Exactly what I wanted
B0007ZDRUI|3|I had mixed results with this, but probably a result of the vehicle I was testing (diesel truck). The truck has no vacuum system, so I tried the turkey baster method, which didn't draw enough gas out. I ended up grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the house, and just holding the tubes that come with this product into the hose attachment of the dyson. That did the trick, and got it bubbling really good.  My problem was, that I performed the test once, got a positive result for exhaust gases. I bypassed the EGR cooler and retested, and the gasses were gone.. Great Success!!!. Nope.. Coolant still being lost, and head gasket eventually had to be replaced. So for me this offered nothing but false hope.
B00KQSLNGQ|5|It works great im happy with it
B0024GW0UQ|5|Perfect fit
B000BZJT3I|5|No shimming necessary.  Works like a dream and nearly noiseless turnover in my old beast now. Great product.
B00LE61UBC|2|Bought the XXX large and it is still too tight.  I am not that big, probably average size.
B00N8LAMCE|5|Perfect fit  for Porsche 991-1.
B0015DQER4|1|Junk did not have top lid flexible spout is not built right leaver is made cheap it's not worth the price I wouldn't use it for a piss can
B0013ERRSK|5|This water container will keep water from spilling all over your car or truck when traveling with your dog. It's easy to use and fill.
B007OW66BE|1|Item is worth 5 stars as is OEM and gas no problems. The reason I gave it 1 start was because I bought it from Toyota Warehouse and 2 days after placing the order I get an email saying it was cancelled due to technical problems. Talk about frustrating so then I placed the order through Amazon with much better results.
B0080HEL9G|1|I got different kinds parts then pictures.
B00EEGDQMA|4|Shipped quickly and was easy to install.<br />The threaded clips to accept the new bolts for attaching brackets to the truck frame were useless and broke apart.  I had to use the clips and bolts which were on the original running boards.
B005IGUXVM|5|Good quality , perfect fit !
B000B8I61G|3|cheap, and don't seem to stay in car door.
B002LKJD7S|5|Just what I needed!
B00YAZEJIA|5|They work good
B000CN7AJE|5|perfect fit
B000K36BCI|5|Works well.  The clip would be nice to have a rubber surface to keep it from sliding, but overall it holds good.
B004QXWWOY|5|High quality,  easy to install. Let's see how it holds up to Chicago winter's with all the salt that they put down on the roads.
B0040CYWX0|4|First broke,, rest work
B00G21K16E|5|Great add on to my car. looks great!!
B00UW4DNEO|5|Came on time and in good shape. Helped a man jump start his vehicle with a V6 with no problem. It recharged our cellphones on a family camp trip. So far this is a good reliable tool to have and does what it says it will.
B0057FJNH4|2|I'm sure it works fine but with the, &#34;does it fit my vehicle tool&#34; it was so wrong it was close to fitting but the box was even labeled for a much larger engine on a different make of car. Not happy at all.
B00E6VUJXC|4|Very good for price
B00J6LVBNY|5|Came in 4 days, it was the size I needed and looks great in my salon
B009YR00MI|5|Fabulous!  Great for any time you might need power.  Completely quiet unlike a generator.
B004L39F6M|5|This is an exact replacement for the original faucet in my Lance truck camper. It was easy to install. The original was broken by a heavy-handed user.
B0074A8LDC|1|I wasn't able to use the remote unfortunately. So I really can't rate the item in question.
B00415CKEE|5|Arrived on time and fit perfect!
B006X8DOPQ|5|Very fast shipping. Product was as described.
B002SB03IS|5|Perfect.
B0002KR88A|5|Solid gauge wire , good quality.
B00J14AKYC|5|These are very heavy and thick and easy to cut. I bought them for my 2002 Explorer, and they work well with a little trimming. My only complaint is that the tan is a little more reddish tan than the picture shows, so they don't match as perfect as I would have liked.
B000KV8KJ2|5|Excellent fit and has been very useful in protecting my vehicle from the first day.  Only wish they would have packaged it better.  They rolled it up and put it in a long box.  It took several days of intense heat and weighted objects for the liner to lie flat.
B00H7H06JE|1|Very bad quality. Fell apart fast.
B008FQI65C|4|I like the size of it and bought it specifically for that reason as it is the shortest antennae I could find. I'm a bit disappointed in the radio quality I get now though. It makes sense that the quality would decrease as the antennae becomes shorter, but I drive almost exclusively in a populated city (not around tall buildings though) and I expected the radio quality would be the same as with my other antennae. A few stations break away at times now. Overall the size is nice and the reception is usually very good though; it's just on occasion that there is an issue.
B000C938XA|5|Perfect fit for my 94 k3500 dually I'm running no cats and the local part store wanted $140 for this pipe and $320 for one with a cat. So you can't go wrong with this I'm very happy!
B00B0YB3B0|5|Great purchase. Very good quality. Couldn't be happier.
B00EECLMWK|5|Works great. Have been using them for a month with no problems. Great price! Dealer would have charged $150 each.
B00W82EF0E|5|This Energette works great for both Jump starting and as a power Bank for charging devices.<br /><br />I've used it quiet a few times for various things, I've only jump started my own car once, but it seems that at every event you go to that has people driving there's always at least one person whose car refuses to start, and they need a jump...Well, now I don't just have to stand there dumbfounded I can actually do something about it! And helping people start their cars when I'm the last person there is always appreciated.<br /><br />It works wonderfully as a power bank, I can charge my laptop and phone, and if I have to drive my siblings somewhere and they need to charge their hand held game systems or phones we don't need to argue over the single 12v plug, that alone pays for itself!<br /><br />All in all I'd say this Energette is worth a purchase if you do a lot of driving, or simply drive people around often, as keeping people from bickering over the single port is helpful, and it hasn't failed me yet.<br />Sample provided in return for my honest opinion on the product given.
B00A8VYAES|5|Works great, fits perfect
B00062ZMSC|5|The best Filter
B00BTGSGFK|5|excellent
B00WH2NODO|5|Had them painted and they look great. Fit truck perfectly.
B00H7LPKKU|5|My husband loves his LockNLube and said it is one of the best tools he has discovered in a long time.  Also it was delivered so quickly - he was impressed!
B003G5Y0ZW|5|Perfect.  I love it.  Thank you.
B00LP5D0KQ|5|It was exactly what I wanted
B000CQTKGM|1|Loudest break pads ever. Squeaked every time the brakes were applied. Replaced with NAPA pads, no more noise.
B00F0C2SSK|4|The information for this product states that it fits Hyundai Elantra GT's from 2012--2014. I have a 2016 Elantra GT and searched everywhere for these window visors, with no luck. One company was nice enough to e-mail me and say they could 'special order' from Korea for $125 plus shipping. The grill for the 2015 Elantra GT changed, and changed once again for the 2016 model but the body style seemed the same to me. Although Amazon told me that this product wouldn't fit the 2016, I took a chance and ordered anyway, very easy to ship back if they didn't fit.<br />GREAT NEWS!! These fit absolutely perfectly on my 2016 Elantra GT and were a fraction of the cost quoted by the other company!!<br /><br />My car is black and most days parked in an asphalt parking lot for work. These allow air flow and I don't have to run out and roll up the windows in the rain. I just installed and hopefully they will work as great as they look. They have a lower profile than previous ones I've installed, which is an added bonus. I gave 4 stars because there were NO instructions of any kind included with the shipment. Luckily I have installed similar products on  previous cars that I owned.<br /><br />FYI-- Installation was simple: I cleaned all the surfaces with rubbing alcohol and they dried quickly..start by exposing about 2-3 inches of the sticky side, allowing the cover tape to hang down where you can grasp it, I was able to tuck the front piece of the visor behind the trim of the side mirrors, as you align with the curve of the door gently pull on the cover tape and apply pressure along the way so the wind visor attaches. I worked from the side mirror back and there is a tiny piece of tape at the very end that will need to be loosened so you can pull it off as well. I removed it and stuck it back on with a short tab visible so I could easily remove it as the final step. Not difficult, even for a girl like me!
B0013F6SL6|5|Looks great, easy to install in under 10 minutes - arrived on the date promised.
B00U3Q6NJS|4|Very handy
B000BQRQWS|1|I dnt like  em n the end part  tht goes  by the side mirrors  don't  stay suck on why is this happen
B004AQZUX2|4|Has a really nice color, but it apparently fails to ignite every few times. Usually turning my headlights on and off about 3 times gets them both on, but sometimes they don't ignite first try.
B006CYMTSO|5|I was hesitate to do the &#34;final stick&#34;...what a difference!  It was exactly the amount of pad and height that I needed in my 2014 Corolla Sport. NO ONE even notices that it is not part of the original interior.
B008VR638C|5|Fit the bike looks and works great.
B0045WBVUM|5|And makes my ride more enjoyable
B0002UHVAA|4|How else are you going to know if the tanks clean? In retrospect, I probably should have just gotten the elbow. I have stopped using the spray port, as a hose down the toilet seems to work a lot better. Ohh.. and don't forget to keep the hose valve closed, as you might get an unexpected spritzing if you forget and unleash the main waste gate.
B000CD5Q7W|4|Pretty well balanced shock. On a 2003 Tahoe 4x4. Cornering improved and smooth hwy ride. Have not been off road.
B000GU5IH4|5|Good fit, good quality
B001O80SVS|5|VERY WELL MADE. GREAT PRICE, THEY WANTED DOUBLE THE PRICE AT LOCAL PARTS STORE.
B008RFHFQM|5|Huge upgrade over the previous aftermarket shackles installed on my truck by the previous owner.
B00ZSB1WP8|1|Quite bad battery life, if ZenPen ever sells online, that brand was incredibly more efficient at holding a change than this battery I got to replace it
B0073XMXMK|1|No Reception.  With the high number fails I see, this company needs to implement some quality control.
B009LQGPEO|4|I had a Whelen Talon for ten years and loved it. I figure it ran for well over 2000 hours in that time. But alas, something happened to the controls, not the lights. This Avenger is just as good, if not better and I expect as good service. This time I chose the red and white and am very glad I did. I believe I get better response with it. There is nothing brighter than a white light. But, why, oh why, did they put the pattern switch on the plug-in next to the on/off switch. It belongs on the light like the Talon. Everybody has their favorite pattern and don't change it at all or seldom. You don't want to take your eyes off the road but if you just reach for the switch you are often going to change the pattern as well as the on/off. Some engineers and their bosses should be promoted to ditch diggers.
B00CFQQQJ6|1|I specifically requested, and made sure via the car compatibility feature of Amazon, that I was ordering an accumulator for a 2009 Nissan Maxima.  Instead, I received a part for a 2002 Honda Accord! Unfortunately, due to a back order on the AC compressor, I just found out when we pulled off the accumulator after replacing the compressor, that it does not fit. I just checked this part again and it says, again, that it is supposed to fit my car.
B001DRLPY4|4|I'm happy with this filter.
B0002JM9NU|1|Please do not buy this product, the handle broke off after third use. Amazon should remove this product.
B000HNAA8W|5|Happy with my puchase.
B0049TZA0S|1|I'm past the 30 days since purchasing, so I can't return... These have only been on for a few weeks, and they are making a terrible grinding noise. I expect to pull them off and find the pads have failed and come apart. I will edit my review if the issue is something other than the pads. I'm upset this product only offers a 30 day return policy.
B00K1NS0PS|5|great light crossing the desert at night time
B002NAOIYE|5|Came in on time and works flawless! Thanks
B00JSY5VJO|5|Love love love this plate,  displays how proud of my son I am, the material is also sturdy
B000RY77DM|5|look like quality wires nicely made thick insulation haven't installed yet hope they work as good as they look got a great price on amazon
B002E5FOR8|5|Easy to install,  works great.
B004T3BI1O|4|I thought it was well built I really enjoy the wide steps.
B00VSQAQC2|1|Did not do as advertised.  I was disappointed with the purchase.  I returned it the same day I received it.
B00CXB659O|3|Lengthy time required to scan and acquire sattelites.. Once acquired, reception is good,, any large trees in a southerly direction easily interrupts reception. The southern exposure needs to be clear to the horizon..It's a bit aggravating but a much lower investment<br />Than a marine gyro unit ( $675 vs $3500.
B00QVQ2UAK|5|I like these lights because the lens are screwed on making it easier to replace bulbs and lens if necessary.  The shipment arrived on time and was well packaged.
B000C83S90|5|Good very good
B00JW1WZEW|3|Metal shaft would not fit the oem threaded actuator,(very poor milling).Disappointed that after disassembling all the panels and electrical connections that when I went to replace the worn gears the part wouldn't work. The concept is great but is lacking good machining. The nylon gear fits properly, why they don't sell the plastic gear only, is beyond me to understand. Of course I called Dorman tech support and was told there were no known problems with this part. Of course I expected an answer like that. I have used Dorman parts for over 40 years and have always been pleased with their products. One last bit of information is that I went on several Nissan forum websites and found out I was not alone with this part not fitting. I cannot grade this item anymore than 1 star. Great idea - poor execution on Dorman.         This is being posted after not returning part. I was able to use a file and wire wheel on the part to get it to work. The problem I discovered was that the threads on the metal shaft were thick and not tapered as they should be to start to thread the parts on. I filed the beginning threads on the shaft and wired wheeled them to accept the threaded metal block. Presto! After doing that I was able to use the parts and they work well now in the car. I am a person with skills that are above average when it comes to mechanics. For the DIY user who feels less than competent I would cross my fingers and hope that the part would come ready to put in and not have to dink around like I did to make it work. It did save me about $460.00 in having to buy two motors from Nissan and would cost around $500.00 in labor. I am upgrading my 1 star to 3 stars and would definitely give it a 5 star if it fit right out of the box.
B00JK8DIAW|1|Like a previous reviewer stated, I also had an issue separating the decal from the paper backing. Spent at least 45 mins battling it. 3/4 of the decal was peeling off but the remaining wanted to stay on the paper and I had to meticulously peel them off and align them back in place. Mind you this is all before even trying to place the decal on the window. So I finally think I'm all set, clean and dry the glass, and place the decal. I go to peel the plastic film back and now half the decal wants to stick to it and not the window! And these are totally different sections than what gave me issues while trying to separate from the paper, so it's not like I messed up the glue or anything while messing with it prior. I finally got fed up with the whole thing and it now rests in crumbled ball in my garbage.
B00VW1BNFM|5|so cute!! lets hope no one steals them
B009DJW68S|5|Fast delivery. Great item
B000C841OG|1|It was the wrong part not what was posted
B00OX1WIT8|4|This is a great product; I like it better than using a storage box to keep jumper cables, first aid kit, etc.  I wish the velcro holders (that keep it in place) were a bit stronger.
B00J46GFCI|4|I found this product on Youtube after failing to find the color match for my car with the other guys.  This color match was about 95% accurate.  The application process, though easy, is not without some issues.  Beware of applying too much paint.  But even if you do, the clean up is quick and easy.  The final finish I achieved was a bit rough but that is probably due to me rather than the product itself.  All in all I would say these guys delivered what they promised.  The color match alone was worth the price. Would definitely recommend to others.
B007JXN9WM|5|Nice
B009SLNFHC|5|good price and great oil
B008G35UOE|5|great seller A+++++++++++++
B00UCO4LN6|1|Advertisement said it was a four piece set, I only received two pieces. When I contacted the seller, they treated me very rudely and  said it was only two pieces .  After one week, the adhesive tape is already coming off the visor. I would  not recommend this product .
B00496TK4S|5|Great product and easy transaction....Thanks
B00R34M9OG|2|Came in the mail with bubbles and slightly mishaped on some of the letters. And when applying you better put it in the correct spot the first time. Don't you even dare think of lining it up and accidentally touching your car because those letters are stuck and now crinkled because the sticker is a jerk.
B0041M9CMU|5|I love the quality within this Hub. They were easy to install and the noise has disappeared. I love it.
B000COVR4M|5|works great on the car
B00ARBHQKE|3|Great price, but didn't realize it would take about a month to arrive.

B000IY4A0Y|5|better quality rotor than most, I was going to replace on our 2011 Suburu outback but the were the same and in  great shape so I will save until the next 40,000 miles
B00TI9OFFU|2|The five layers were deceiving but price was good
B002OPBMQA|5|Exact replacement
B00RI4467Y|5|My husband had the opportunity to buy one of these at a discount through his workplace.  One of his sales managers had taken one to a trade show and jump started 19 cars with it before there was no charge left.<br /><br />We've used this product to jump start our own cars and recharge cell phones.  It is no bigger than a pocket book and not as heavy as I expected.  Ours came with a nice carrying case that fits under the seat easily.<br /><br />All in all, we love this product.
B0027QWNDM|4|Does the job nicely.  I cut some of the stitching to allow documents to fit better.
B00CFQRO5G|5|Performed well at the track
B008Y80RMG|5|Fit perfectly!
B0085MT3FS|5|Easiest thing to install! It goes right over the current grille no need to remove your existing one.
B000CJ00EA|5|this installed easily and looks good. the one I ordered had a small dent on the inside but it probably will anyway before summer is over. overall it is a good purchase
B00ERXG4TM|4|Inexpensive, easy to put on and take back off. I bought it so I could let go of the throttle from time to time on long trips. This is perfect for that application.
B00427RMSU|5|Price was absolutely low.  Great deal on a factory part.
B0049J3SK2|4|Not light but lighter than steel.  It is solid and I have loaded it up to it's limits no issues.  Make sure to balance the weight and it will work great.
B000GZAUG8|5|I only get the best for my Maxima and at this price I would definitely recommend them to anyone!
B00LFKZDWO|1|The last six lights don't work!! Would like to speak to owner!!
B00FV1MLU0|2|I've purchased this item for my 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe. It fits perfect for the front driver and passenger side windows but not for the rear windows. It's off by 2 inches and probably meant for a older versions of the Santa Fe before 2015.
B00COYNVPQ|5|Thanks
B0087GRB1K|2|3-Bolt Flange not on right position ,have to go to shop spend extra $50 to get it install。
B00S5O3DIY|4|Very pleased with the quality and quantity of the decal.  Did not get a perfect lie on my first try, but was able to easily partly remove and reposition with excellent results.  Very pleased with how my project turned out and have a lot left to play with!  Used liquid chalk markers,wash off easily.
B000HEBR3I|5|A little messy but so is any hand pump. Use this to transfer Kerosene with ease. Will buy another when this one breaks.
B003YC845O|5|Worked great stopped a pesky trans pan leak.  Had a TCI glide with a chrome pan that came in racing trans
B008B486RQ|1|does not fit the mini baja chain its not the rite size
B003JHBM1M|4|Fits alright, a little too small on the side for the front driver seat, but what do ya expect? Almost 50% off weathertech's price when I bought it here on Amazon. Good product overall. Would recommend.
B00C13C2Y6|5|Love them! Nice change from my original ones. I throw my car into reverse as much as possible now haha.. No complaints.
B00P9WKB80|1|Did not include censor.
B000B66UUW|1|Complete junk, never buy this item, cheap plastic
B00FYX204C|5|Serves its purpose at an affordable price!
B00KTHV10C|5|I used this to replace my 2006 Honda Civic key which had broke.  After a month's use, it is working great.  I had to get the key cut, which cost me about $10 at locally owned Ace hardware (the first Ace and Lowes did could not cut the key...you may have to shop around). The remote part fit right in.
B00EKEGRVS|5|Holds my sunglasses perfectly!
B007KTIO02|5|I love it...works great!
B00N3NONIG|3|This fits things like skinny water bottles, beer bottles, and aluminum cans very well. But anything thicker won't fit. It doesn't even fit solo cups or certain coffee cups.<br /><br />I got this because I'm an Uber driver. My previous car, before it got smashed, had a backseat armrest with cupholders. So I got this to replace it.
B00DJ3OUQK|5|worked fine

B00SCXCQV8|5|great for the money
B00JKOEFVW|5|Very nice product
B00EFFX94U|4|matched Kubota's paint exactly! But when it dried it was softer than Kubota's paint and wold scratch easily. However after about a month it became harder and wouldn't scratch as easily.

B000BZI1EG|5|great fit
B004KM8MCW|2|The item is cheap and flimsy and does not seem to be made of metal.  It sounds like plastic when hit against something and is easily bent by hand.  Definitely not going to put this on my car!!
B0006JLVC6|5|Great!
B007KT81EQ|5|This is a great product and gives out great light.
B00B6QEOFO|5|Love it

B000IYPSLY|5|Perfect fit
B006VU3762|5|Used on a motorcycle. Very nice shine.
B005SUX9MI|4|Worked fine with 25 mm bearings. Only problem with this tool was the threads on the 25mm puller were a little bit smashed at the end. I was able to fix it with a thread file and it worked fine. The instructions are not very good at all but it is a very easy tool to figure out.
B000COCRHI|5|Installed on liftgate for 1997 Explorer, fit great. Comes with 4, only used 2, no trimming required. Gate latches positively and interior turns off.
B001DKRGLM|5|Just like the professionals use!

B00K8WO768|5|Fantastic shipping and product just as described.
B00L28Z2GG|5|A plus part and service
B003948HJ0|2|It's a cool license plate frame and all but upon Installing it I noticed it covers the tags on the plate. Eventually I will be getting my permanent veteran plates and won't have to worry about that but for those that will have tags kind of a bummer.
B00DYSDSAY|5|Its been 6 months and it is holding up nicely

B00JXS3BXI|4|Every ,an needs a good wench... I mean winch.
B006B7Z6NW|5|the quality of this product feels very well made. The filter material seems to be really durable, time will tell if it can hold up to multiple cleaning sessions. I will update as I go along in the cleaning process.
B00IITT2U4|4|Although the holes don't do anything for rotor performance, they look cool.  After installing the kit and driving for about a month, I can say that they perform pretty well.  They definitely don't stop you as fast as a race car's braking system, but they look great and perform safely.<br /><br />As a tip, it's always a good idea to bed-in the brakes.  Basically, this transfers a layer of the ceramic brake pad material onto the rotors to help raise the frictional coefficient.  It also prevents warping and cracking of the rotors due to heat changes.<br /><br />To do this, find a safe place to go from 60mph down to about 20mph (do what you can safely).  This keeps the brakes hot and deposits the material evenly.  Don't come to a complete stop or you can create an uneven surface.  Don't let your ABS activate.  After doing this for 5-8 times, drive until the brakes are cool.  Go easy on the brakes otherwise for a few hundred miles.
B00GLXHM6K|5|These are top-quality! I use them for both night and daytime driving it literally lights up your world!
B008427D88|5|getting under your evo x you may have noticed the plastic tray sagging in some parts.  overtime the plastic rivets pop out which leads to the front underpanels hanging.  these 8mm rivets are a great fit for the evo x, not too tight as the 9mm seem to be.  highly recommended!
B00CEPVD00|5|Work good for me!
B00TJ50TYO|4|The headlight ate great they look so sporty and they were easy to instal .

B00UHD4HJA|5|Totally want another pack just like this great deal
B001C6OZ66|1|have not install yet but have seen them installed and works well but a lot of work to install, Should be installed when vehicle is new or as soon as door becomes had to move. Delay will cause door and door frame to bend
B000EQUL22|5|Exactly what I needed to replace my old spark plug wires. They were just as described and the perfect length...and cheaper than the parts store
B0010GG7YG|5|Great price and perfect fit , works as it should , when I received it opened box had it installed in less than 10 minutes.
B008JCW9GY|5|fantastic product did arrive damaged but Amazon and superwinch made it right very happy with the winch

B005JU5W54|5|My best purchase i loved the feel of a genuine product on my windshield.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|The Jumbo fits both my 05 Grand Cherokee and 11 Charger well.  Easy to use and stows in a small sleeve.  Folds and unfolds quickly (like a band saw blade) with little practice.<br />I have used it for ~ a month.
B0007XS06Q|5|hot water heater now works
B00HNW8MJ4|5|Excelente
B00RRBP46U|3|Seem cheap and did not work as dash replacement bulbs. I've returned them.
B00RSOLXFM|5|Fast shipping. Great product already had it running in my truck for a few days now and the air smells cleaner. Great customer service. I enjoyed the email from the owner on the product most companies don't do that anymore.
B007HOGOMU|5|15' foot length is super and easy to wind up
B003VAYBLU|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B002P3KJLU|5|Awesome.
B006IYWRP8|5|It is hard to find stands that fit a particular bike correctly, but this is very good fit for my second generation Suzuki Hayabusa.  Can put it on both stands without removing any plastic parts. Have to be very careful with the front fender and the bottom part of the head light, but with a caution it can be done safely.
B00EKN8FXC|5|These work very well ,and should reduce battery draw tremendously . Use bulb grease on contacts and carefully press into socket using the base for leverage.
B003VAYJAS|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B000CQRNN4|1|Put these on the front of a Chevrolet trailblazer. They squealed from day 1. Get the ceramic pads. Make sure to replace your rotors or have them turned. Wagner usually has been good to me in the past. Not this time tho
B012E87QHU|5|These are great!!  I originally thought they were decals until they arrived.  I think I was more happy that they were magnets than decals.  They were larger than I had expected too.  Very funny, and very cool reflective magnets.  I stuck one on my wife's mini van without her knowing and she drove around all day.  She finally called me and we had a good laugh about it.  She thought they were just as funny as I did.  These seem to be made of very good quality and hold quite well.  They have a nice reflective print on them.  I might stick one on the grandparents car too....lol.  I really like these reflective magnets.  They are great.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price to review.
B003ULHUPO|1|Not compatible with 2006 F150 4.6 XLT
B00GOA9YFW|5|Yes need to order more
B00846Z97G|4|Great pricing, quick service!
B006VSW4EK|4|Packaging was below &#34;new&#34; quality standards, products box was damaged, jet sticker on top of maf comes off, product looked used with new gasket replaced, but day one install proved well worth the purchase!!  With (i,h,e) and unichip pb cars performance was increased imo, day one and no codes, throttle does seem better, and my cexhaust sounds louder?? :)
B00K889FCI|5|This stuff works brilliantly when you do it right!
B00AKX9VPM|3|This are misleadingly mis-named!!  They are NOT 'screw' rivets.  The rivet part has a phillips type head, but it's only to make it easier to push them in.  The rivets are serrated (so they stay in), but they are NOT threaded.  And because the rivets fit flush in the expanding part, they are VERY hard to remove without damaging one or both parts.<br />However, they CAN be used with #10, 3/4 inch sheet metal screws in place of the rivet.  And they are easily reuseable with a screw!  And... even with buying the screws, they are cheaper than the panel rivets from a dealer.
B00B0P8SVC|4|Love my items
B00KTIYXLU|2|The directions were very clear and easy to follow. The reason for the two stars is due to the fact that they lasted an extremely short time. I got about two good weeks out of the two of them combined. Not worth all the money I paid for the two of them. I would go somewhere else.
B00H5F3J9C|5|Very nice product for the price. Fits Lexus chrome rims perfectly.
B0025Z7ZR4|5|Worked great and is made well
B004WMDXRE|5|Worked perfect!
B0076I4TE2|5|very impressed with quality of part , Great Price
B0040CVTE0|5|Great product
B006DA34M2|5|Product was as described and shipping was fast!
B004SCETXU|5|This mount met my needs and fit with my 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek.
B00RGQ1OJW|5|great quality, looks great on bike
B00138OMJI|5|These are excellent for holding the bow and stern of my kayak on the roof rack. Soooo much easier than rope alone. Heavy duty good quality product.
B00FPTAP4M|5|It was a good sticker
B00NWT66CM|5|Fit perfectly, works great.
B00X8UBQMK|5|Great product!!!
B000E4QM7C|5|Replaced my original factory mirror perfectly, was easy to install and looks just like the original.
B004A6679S|5|Easy to install, much better design than OE, great upgrade with accel, or msd coil.
B000C6KMAK|5|Contrary to a review on the &#34;failure&#34;  of this filter brand, I speak from personal experience.  Have been using the Classic on our previous '08 Honda Fit owned from new.  Sold it last year with 150k miles and no issues ever.  Used to be a Fram follower 2 decades ago, but after comparing the inards, switching to the Purolator brand was easy, given the USA build quality and attractive pricing.  BTW, worthwhile to note that Honda OEM filters are now supplied by FRAM.  Open them up and observe that both bases holding the pleats are made of  &#34;CARDBOARD&#34;!!!!!!!!!  Purolator uses STEEL bases.<br />Am using the same 14610 on our current '15 Honda Fit LX and my in-laws '10 Civic LX.<br />A change costs me $22.  Since I'm an avid DIY'r, I not only save a few bucks, but know that my car is running on a top quality motor oil (0W/20 Mobil 1 Extended Performance) and a quality filter.  Dealerships and &#34;quicky&#34; lubes will charge you a minimum of $35 but use &#34;bulk&#34; synthetic blended oils and, sometimes, even &#34;china&#34; knock-off filters.<br />What pains me most is when techs over-tighten the drain bolt and the filter.  It's a wonderful practise that happens more often that not, designed to make it difficult for the &#34;home&#34; mechanic.
B009NLJ0GW|5|Excellent
B000JLMWC4|5|Perfect to replace original and more space in the engine compartment after getting rid of al those vacuum hoses and those pipes connected to your stock exhaust. Replace stock with Pacesetters exhaust. It starts right up.
B00O8AKDEQ|1|I have to admit the quality is good, but the first problem is the color is much more orange than gold.  Not as pictured.  The second and biggest problem with these is that they are advertised as adjustable, but they are still not suitable for small hands.  The closest/smallest setting on these is still farther out than my stock clutch lever on my 2014 Honda Grom.
B00NTOJU28|5|Needed brighter lighting at night for the back of the jeep while trail running.<br /><br />Work perfectly, plug and play.<br /><br />Still working great.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
B00480J4KA|4|As advertised!
B00SISL36Q|1|did not fit !!!
B00S4YZRQG|2|I will be fair, it looked pretty awesome on my car. It went nicely with the orange paint and black rims. The install was fairly straightforward and only took half an hour. HOWEVER, it took only a full minute for all four trim pieces to go flying off once I started driving. Seeing as how I plan on driving my car, and how this product does not work while I am doing that, I fail to see the purpose of putting this product on my car.
B00CMU9GOC|5|makes my ruckus go vroom vroom install was super simple
B004EKYB7U|5|Good perfect fit
B000COWA8E|5|Fit my 351 distributor after some small filing for clearance. After install with new plugs and wires, I felt a nice bump in throttle response, and saw a 2mpg increase...can't ask for anything more! Plus, I absolutely love the locking cap system they designed to lock your wires in place! Awesome!
B000BQWLE6|2|Should have measured, SO small!
B00S4OUU90|4|ok
B00B0C1SJ4|5|Bad Azz brakes looks great and stops great..
B0024NSLPM|1|DO NOT PURCHASE THESE HEADLAMPS!<br />I am sorry to say that I did. I had a certified auto body shop install them, and learned that the bulb sockets used in these after-market assemblies were either faulty or assembled incorrectly because they shorted out the electrical system of the car. I've spent more than these cost to troubleshoot and repair the damage.
B0007XXTVC|5|water heater now works in the RV
B000IYR7PE|4|Great Peoduct at a cheaper price, fits just like the OEM. The suppliers are great to work with as well.
B013IARUPQ|5|Worked perfectly in 2005 Touring
B003SYXSU4|5|PERFECT!
B007V2E7KY|5|Works as advertised for a 2012 Toyota Venza XLE. A bit awkward to use compared to the soft roll up shields but the rigidness will hold up longer without bending.
B00GNHPWQQ|3|They look great but the only problems are they slide up and down on the belt and when you take your seat belt off the pad tends to not let the seat belt retract.
B00CXZ7HQA|5|Its so cute. I had no trouble putting it on my car. I did it pretty quick before reading directions and still i had minimal bubbles which i took care of fairly easy.
B0090R5R70|5|Great
B00BPJ0JG0|5|Exelent
B008K6I1RU|5|No problems, got what I ordered.
B004GD6P1U|5|It fits!!!!
B00316K61S|5|Works very well for testing my batteries. So yes it works great does everything I want it to do.
B003S835B2|5|Great too get exactly what is in the listing.  The key works fine and programming instruction were included. Very fast delivery time.5 stars.
B00EK5D5O4|5|Very happy with the light bar. It's just as they  describe.
B00CIB5RCU|1|Mine stopped working after 4 months, now it's a piece of junk.
B00REJXAZC|5|Easy install and looks great. Thanks.
B004DGCT42|3|It came in a timely manner but it did not have the Bentley B on it like it was supposed to. Don't really know how to send it back or if it would even be worth it. I really wanted it to have that on it
B000ML80V8|5|Good
B00MOKLWMY|3|Excellent fit, not to sure about strength of mounting brackets, yet to be judged.
B00C48TJ58|1|Bought this on 23/7/2013 together with LK730 battery, from one of their ebay dealers (apple - ct)<br />Very happy for 22 months. However after 22 months the LEDs started to fail one by one. Now its almost impossible to read the speed on the display or any other thing, like time or version, since 50% of the LEDs have failed.<br />After 24 months, also the battery has failed completely, meaning that sometimes while driving the camera will shutdown due to low current !!!<br />Customer support from Lukas is non existent, they just said send it to your supplier. Interesting, if the supplier didn't disappear, to send a camera to Korea, to repair some leds. No service contact or shop, nothing at all.<br />Worst support ever!!!<br />Sure thing I will run whenever I hear Lukas again.
B000BUOSGG|5|Perfect fit in the RV sink.  Small enough to put on counter as well.  Easy to clean.
B000ICYC4U|5|great price showed up fast.
B000P6WQB0|5|Better than competing brands.  Worth the premium.
B005FJ0BRI|5|I've used this hundreds of time to scan many vehicles very good product for the money you can't go wrong highly recommended
B000JD53IC|5|Good fit
B005T3PXNM|2|My rig is 32' and according to the specs it should have easily covered it. It was long enough but did not completely cover the front.<br /><br />It was also paper then. It tore in multiple places that I had to duct tape.<br /><br />I would spend a little more and get one that is made of better material.
B00C8A2WZG|4|Honda product that fit perfectly.
B00M78820I|5|This is a great product.  It arrived very soon after I ordered it, and was extremely easy to set up.  No complaints, and complete satisfaction!
B005PZMKZI|4|These are very nice, well made. A value three times the $40 dollars paid.<br />The video on their website shows how they install, and suggestions for modified installations. The video says you have to cut the cover to allow the headrest to fit through them. They do have to be cut, I was afraid cutting the material would lead to rapid unraveling of them. This didn't happen, as the video promises they won't fall apart when cut. I did only cut an 'X' where the posts for the headrests fit.<br />They look great, I've gotten many compliments on them. They have been installed about three months and still fit and look great!
B0024ECAE4|5|Easy to install and use - seems to be built solid.
B00EAJD89C|5|EXCELLENT!
B003QIO0M2|5|THER GOOD FOR A BRIFCHASE
B001DRLQ5C|1|I have used the W 940/1 Mann Filter for my application. It now has been discontinued and replaced with ML 1004 which is now no longer listed for my application? What is going on?? Very confusing info from Mann Filter. Find something else for your application.
B00NVBW5EY|1|It was more trouble than the problems I was trying to solve.  It just did not fit or work right in either of my Mercedes E class cars or the SL.
B00H36XX6C|4|The NOCO XGrid XGB3L is a great battery pack / flashlight combination to have on hand.<br /><br />PACKAGING:  This item is packaged and presented very well.  A standard brown cardboard box contains the main box that would be displayed in a retail environment.  This box is very sturdy and would require a lot of energy to bend.  A cardboard sleeve slides down to reveal a plastic coffin that holds the XGB3L securely.  Two small paper manuals and the charging cable are underneath the coffin.  The charging cable is tied with a small rubber band.  The care of the packaging suggest a quality product.<br /><br />PRODUCT:  The XGB3Ls outer skin is made of the type of rubber that feels very pleasant when held... almost like silk.  This material also provides a secure grip when wet.  The device appears very rugged and I have little doubt that it could survive several drops without problem.<br /><br />I do wish there was a hole to loop a lanyard for your wrist, however.  Better yet, I wish it came wish the lanyard.  This would greatly increase it's utility as a rugged outdoor flashlight.<br /><br />There is a door/flap at the bottom of the device that opens up revealing the The USB (5v in) and mini-USB (5v in) charging ports.  This door doesn't secure as well as I would hope, however.  It easily pops open with very little force and stays shut simply because the rubber door is slightly larger than the hard plastic walls inside.  Considering the water resistant nature of the device, some sort of securing mechanism would be desirable here.<br /><br />Each device has a unique serial number engraved into the casing.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />There are two rubber buttons on the outside of the device.  The larger button toggles the flashlight mode from<br />- 100% 250 Lumens (4 hours)<br />- 50% 125 Lumens (8 hours)<br />- 10% 25 Lumens (72 hours)<br />- Strobe 250 Lumens (120 hours)<br />- Off.<br /><br />The documentation claims that the battery can hold a charge for 1 year when off.  What isn't clear is if this is a linear drain or not.  After 6 months does the battery hold a 50% charge?  This is unknown.<br /><br />Even in 25 lumens mode, there is ample light to navigate dark environments.  250 lumens enough light to reasonable illuminate a room.<br /><br />The smaller button turns on external device charging.  A small LED light will come on informing you the XGB3L is ready to charge other devices (green means 80% charge or higher remaining, orange means less than 80%).  On a full charge I was able to charge my Sony Xperia X1 smartphone twice.  It charges devices very fast.<br /><br />The XGB3L also saved our PS4 gaming night when one of the controllers drained to zero.  The PS4 console is located across the room, so it is not reasonable to plug it in while playing.  But once the XGB3L was plugged into the PS4 controller (using the provided cable) the controller not only worked fine while playing but also charged up while playing.<br /><br />The device itself charges very slow, however.  The manual suggest that 2.7 to charge the XGB3L, but my tests come closer to 4 hours.  The green and orange LED lights are also visible when charging the device letting you know roughly how far along in the charging process you are.<br /><br />Be aware of ambient temperature requirements for this device, however.  The XGB3L will work properly in the the 41 degree to 95 degree range.  This is rather strict for an outside flashlight and many places in the United States will fall out of this temperature range.<br /><br />WARRANTY:  1 year, but keep your receipt.  Without the original receipt only 45% is covered.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  The XGB3L is an excellent 3000mAh Lithium-ion that claims a lifecyle of over 1,000.  A couple of small issues (lanyard, more secure flap) could be improved, however.  But I recommend this product and the quality of the craftsmanship is evidence from the packaging to the performance.when off.  What isn't clear is if this is a linear drain or not.

B00P6UTAQ4|5|Is what it says
B002MEHFVO|5|Easy to install and works as it is suppose to.
B003AV6ARS|5|Great, quiet pads-- nice replacement for stock MB--
B006NZTZLQ|5|Great product, I've should've got this before. My 2005 infiniti g35 is done with its warranty years ago.  Now I drive with total confidence. Must have for car owner who daily with no time to hasstle with car service shops.
B001JSYFW6|5|best car smell ever. Smells natural vanilla, instead of a chemical smell.
B000LXYWTQ|5|Nice quality good product
B000P0ZJ9M|1|Shattered the second time I used it. Surprisingly failed while installing brake slider bolts. Looks like a good tool, I was very surprised it broke.
B002M3AO68|4|Very good product, easy to assemble and put it in the hitch. After folding it up though I was unable to put the locking pin in, the hole isn't exactly where it needs to be, I had to drill out the hole to make it fit. Otherwise very happy with it.
B003PIIOUW|5|Awesome
B003VLBPJA|5|good job guys. sure came in handy for my small pickups on my motorcycle. thanks
B00INVEUP4|5|Good wire..........just what I needed
B000Q8GVPY|5|Good tool and very strong.  Used it to take Cam off and worked fine.
B00CMOVFME|4|Calipers are poorly painted. Just spray your own if yours work. Brakes are great. Passed expectations.
B000CNLXGK|2|Item was received damaged
B003K00BCO|5|great exhaust tip for 2015 silverado 5.3 . fits perfect and really heavy duty.looks great. thanks
B00F0MYGYY|3|Frankly the tray isn't designed for a 2014 f-150...  Perhaps earlier years but not 2014...  It doesn't reach across the full width of the seat which was previously stated and I can live with that... Just because it fits under the seat doesn't mean it is designed for every year model.. It is not designed to be attached...  . and it is ridiculously  over priced...  I would be better off with cut down cardboard boxes.... Rather disappointed
B00V30J86I|1|not large enough I thought it would be like the purse pouch that is advertised on TV
B00TIEATVY|5|Great throttle lock for not a lot of money. Simply uses friction to hold throttle in place but easily allows you to snap the throttle shut when needed. Plastic construction is holding up well but I'm afraid that it'll eventually crack considering I leave it on the throttle at all times and it is exposed to the elements when sitting outside. If you commute or tour with a bike without cruise, this $20 solution will make a huge difference in your comfort!
B00KO77C5A|5|This hitch is easy to install and the head being easily removed it makes it easy to take out when necessary. I would highly recommend this hitch to anyone that is considering a fifth wheel addition to their B & W turnover gooseneck ball.
B0058WXNOK|1|It is mot as easy as the instructions indicate.  I did 3 places and none of them stayed together..I feel I am going to have it done professionally depending on the cost.
B0002LBGX2|5|It is by far the best Carnuba wax I've used.  It makes colors look wet to the touch. Even the color white turns out incredible. I use it on my Black Marauder and it looks amazing. It is also the easiest application and wiping off of any wax I've used.
B00E15M1ZW|3|I am not going to say anything about how hard these are to change, but let's just say they are a nightmare. The only reason I say that is because once you have spent hours or days taking the old mounts off then to find out the holes do not line up exactly. Not as in they are the wrong part but rather the hole was drilled just a fraction of an inch off. I spent hours just trying to get two in place to find out I had to take it back out to in large the holes. Which means now the mount has room to move which is not good. But for the price one expects things like these.
B00CMY3R3E|5|Exactly as expected.  Real cute.  I've had it about three months now and it still looks good.
B00063X38M|5|its 3m it always works
B003JH6IE8|3|The fit is really very good, basically took it out of the package and dropped it in to place.  They are much thinner than I expected, in fact very thin.  Just doesn't seem like the mat will last as long.  Will have to do a long term test.
B006573MTS|5|Yes it is great
B00ZASLWUO|5|All parts were on target, perfect fit, no issues, recommended, would buy again.
B00N5DUPLS|5|Nice
B00A4MWSZ4|5|awesome product
B009D2R5YU|5|just as advertised
B00BCRMAAS|4|Kind of a pain to put on the seats. The directions day didn't make sense. Said to use the zipper part on the front seat....but it doesn't go on the front seat. However once I threw out the direction and got them on they did look good. They look nice
B0014FGS2Y|3|The hitch was a little difficult to install. It was not wide enough to go outside the frame. I called Reese and the said to just bend it do it would fit. Also difficult to install the washers between the frame and hitch. Seems sturdy once installed
B007MUXQVG|1|I've had my car for three years, used a variety of wiper fluids, and never had a problem with smell. However, pouring this into the fluid holder, it smelled really bad, and really strong, and every time I've used it on my windshield, it filled my car with a pungent, concentrated bug spray smell that lingered and left me turning the AC to inside circulating every time, so the fumes wouldn't get in. Every other fluid I've used works fine in cold and on window debris, with no smell. Get something that doesn't stink.
B004SFKJIQ|5|Perfect
B00YMKO2RG|3|The design and look are outstanding. The exhaust tip looks great on the Chevy Cruze LT. THE PROBLEM IS THE MICKEY MOUSE DESIGN TO SECURE IT TO THE TAILPIPE IS RIDICULES! ~ It only has two screw shafts (with no head) and two nuts. What a joke! - You will have to find a better way to secure the tip than the way carcoolparts from overseas has designed it if you want it to stay on the car. Man, but it sure looks good on my blue cruze once I secured it.  I would give it 5 stars IF they designed a better way to secure it!
B013ME9PII|5|I didn't get mine through Amazon but I do have one on my 2007 V-Strom 650. Its a wonderful addition to my motorcycle. For me it solved the short term helmet storage dilemma. Riders know what I'm talking about where you take your helmet off for just a brief moment, place it on your bike somewhere, and it falls off. Or, you place it on one of your mirrors, subsequently throwing it out of alignment. I like the fact that I can use it to lock my helmet as well even though I already do something else. Its one of those inventions you look at and say, &#34;Why didn't I think of that!&#34; It will be on any motorcycle I own from now on. Trust me, you will love the convenience and having it as an option.
B00NP60URE|5|Comes in very handy!
B007NNH3VQ|5|Worked very well
B004HH8LEE|5|Great quality Looks good!
B0002LEDMI|3|Not a bad item for the price. &#34;Metal&#34; grates are not trustworthy. I wouldn't put much weight on them. Metal is very thin. I carried 3 bikes and 5 beach chairs 1200 miles and it worked well. Great for light duty hauling.
B003NBK1RU|5|just what I needed
B003ZWCAXU|5|Excellent worked out great!
B000S2U49W|1|Does not fit a 2015 GMC Acadia...
B001HRGGXA|5|good .havent tried it yet.
B00V9W6U98|4|Looked great fit good on my 08 Silverado crew cab I painted them white to match.<br />Only dawn side was they felt a little cheap but still happy for the price!!!
B000FPYDEY|5|This little touch makes a big difference to the look of my classic little CJ5.
B00FQ0ROZS|3|PRODUCT AS DESCRIBE DIDN'T USE THEM
B00SDMJLQ6|5|I just got a 2012 Mustang and the seat belt is hard to find.  This extender fits!!  Makes it so much easier to buckle up!  I'm getting another for the passenger.  yay
B009XIR8CS|5|Very nice fits great onto a 2013 Suzuki kingquad 400 and its very comfortable
B00CLUYFNA|5|perfect
B00NX8EYFI|5|I love it. So awesome. Perfect size and everything. Thank you
B00WNFQLHG|5|Looks great, easy to put on. Very satisfied
B00QIQQ1BM|4|great looking hats , not as comfortable as they look !
B00JWG4P7C|5|Just what I wanted and more. Very bright for what I needed on the front of my boat.
B003D32OFK|5|Good alternative at a reasonable price. Easy to install. Loud alarm. Easy to test. I'm happy.
B001V8U12M|5|Makes stabilizing the trailer quick and easy
B00D1SWPTM|4|Far exceeds my expectations for night lighting of my boat
B00KYDA2GA|5|Looks great on front of truck
B00Z25ZA3K|5|Looks awesome
B003UY12FU|5|Looks great,  really high quality and huge
B00LUIQFXW|5|This switch worked perfectly, I would recommend it with no problem.
B007EA6R0Q|5|This is the best bike rack on the market for the money.  It is built incredibly tough.  It was easy to assemble and sits tight in the hitch.  The weight is manageable.  With the rack folded, it is easy to transport and install.  The parts are a bit stiff at first, but loosen with use.<br /><br />Putting 5 bikes on any rack is an exercise in spacial recognition and engineering.  I was able to get 2 adult bikes and 3 teen bikes on the rack and safely go for a 3 hour road trip.  I recommend you take a picture of the bike placement if you like it.  I forgot the order when I reloaded the bikes and wasted 10 minutes figuring things out again.
B00CGCOQHS|5|It looks great on my car!!!
B0002NIKHA|5|My husband loves it. Perfect fit!
B008G27UYS|5|Perfect fit as good as the origin and it came with a headlight bulb
B00KTHWXH2|5|The case fit my remote component exactly.  It was easy to put together...remember there is a small slot for a flat blade screwdriver so you can pop the two halves of the case apart.  I had to chase down a locksmith to cut the key blank to match my old key and I was good to go.  This case won't correct a broken remote switch, but it will replace your worn case with a new one for a very good price.
B0038AAW16|4|Just hope it lasts longer than the last motor.
B00MG1BARS|5|As always, great product from LuckyBike. Have ordered from company several times, never a problem. A++
B00D8RYHHE|5|Fast shipping, and light bar works awesome. Puts out plenty of light.
B0015D4ZH0|4|good winch with everything needed for installation. works great. I installed a power cut off switch for added safety.
B00SCXCQV8|5|Super bright love them
B00DSYAUYQ|1|Held a bottle of water nicely, but weight of bottle kept tilting the holder down, couldn't get bracket tight  enough  to hold solid,  good idea but just cant use it
B009DJZ57C|5|Great deal; quick-ship
B00029K21Q|3|Did not fit my Chrysler Pacifica rear coil springs
B0093JS0GK|5|Just like original. works perfect.
B00WUG1A6U|5|Very bright
B000CNHTWM|1|fel-pro intake manifold gasket set 1212  is not a Toyota part, fits big block g.m.
B00S05TU3K|5|These adapters were installed in my 2015 Volkswagen Passat and fit perfectly. The HID bulb itself was a little on the bulkier side so it required  some filing but still works great and is exactly what I needed
B00OKWY3PW|5|Prefect fit easy to install
B0083SGLO0|1|These things feel apart in my hand when installing! Complete waste of money!
B00U6QFQAM|4|These make it really easy to undo the bolts in the back but you still need the tool to undo the two over the driver and passenger seat.
B007QW4VUU|5|They FEEL great for waxing car and wheels -- actually have not yet put them to use... I'm SURE to be pleased!!!
B003AYBWFU|5|Direct bolt in 2010 MS3, will need to use stock downpipe to catback bolts or buy new. Product delivered before estimated delivery. Just make sure to tune after install!!!
B00080QHMM|3|Only does 1/2 pound increments - so you will see 31 - 31.5 - 32 readings
B007HRVQ8O|5|was great
B000WEKQ3K|5|Fast ship, perfect fit. My wife is very pleased. Thank-you.
B00ADXWMUK|3|The bike is a good deal for the price.  One major problem.  The installation instruction are not detailed enough.  I have yet to figure out where one of the hoses on the front of the bike goes.  Have not been able to find it on the internet as well.
B0000AY65X|3|I bought this to clean/polish stainless appliances - needed so much elbow grease & patience. Not sure if the effort was worth it.
B00KLKKWCA|5|ok
B000R5D7S0|5|Doing the job yourself with engine in the truck. Buy this. #6 (&#5) tube will drive you nuts. Much easier with this, For the money.
B000CQRPT6|5|Very quiet,good quality
B00KWGHLOK|5|Excellent fit to 2010 vw cc.
B00BCRMB34|3|Very nice but does not stay well on leather.
B0101A0C38|5|Love it. And it came quick
B0086I9VC6|5|good
B009YR00MI|2|It does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Upon receiving i plugged it in to charge (very easy) and within 2 hours my son infomred methat his truck was dead.  I unplugged it and used it to jump my sons truck. Worked pefectly.  I really bought it to power my CPAP machine for camping which Ive had to chance to try; it worked great for one night. Went to bed at 11ishpm and woke up at 7am. Worked fine. The following night, it woke me up by beeping loudly at 4am and then it died.  So basically I got 1.5 nights out of it. Luckily it was only a 2 night trip!<br /><br />Since then i purchaed the 12 volt charger but havent tested it . I am also interested it the solar re-charge. I will ipdae the review if that ever happens.<br /><br />REVIEW AFTER TWO YEARS - After 2 years I am lucky if I can get 3 hours of power to charge my C-pap machine.  I have used the 12volt charger as well as solar panel and it only holds a charge that will last for approx. 3 hours. When camping I go to bed at 10 or 11pm and wake up gasping in my tent at 1-2am in the morning! Not what I was expecting for the cost of the unit. Basically I got one or 2 good nights of c-pap support from mine since purchasing. Aside from not supporting the c-pap as i had hoped, it works great as a car jumper!<br /><br />C-PAP Users - AFTER ONE YEAR REVIEW:  I bought the Duracel Powerpack 1300 on July 15th, 2015.  I bought mainly to run my c-pap machine while camping.  As mentioned above, the unit worked fine the first few times out.  We go camping approx. 6x year and with each trip, the unit would run my c-pap machine a little less each time. In between trips, it would stay plugged in (it has auto stop charging function) and i would use it occasionally to jump start a car or lawn tractor....well this summer, the darn unit worked for about 3 hours and then would start beeping and then run out of juice in the middle of the night.  For four days and nights, i would sleep sound for 3 hours and then the rest of the night was crap.  I charged it via a solar panel and got only 3 hours of use of the c-pap machine.  I charged it from an outlet and got 3 hours of use....you get the idea.<br /><br />I was so very hopeful this would fit my needs and now im wondering how Im going to get thru the rest of the summer camp trips.<br /><br />So, for me and my c-pap machine, this unit is NOT meeting my needs anymore.  For phones, ipads, kindles, its prolly just fine.panel and got only 3 hours of use of the c-pap machine.  I charged it from an outlet and got 3 hours of use....you get the idea.

B00KR915E4|5|Very nice loose fitting Jersey.  Brought it a little large in order to put layers underneath when the weather changes
B0002Z9O3C|5|Very nice lock. Shipped quickly
B001AWM3C0|5|Great product, works well, have 2 units now, and like the way it indicates charging status, and conditions battery. Value for money very good as it handles 2 batteries at same time!
B0027XY6FS|5|Same product as the store and a much better price.
B00GBM04NE|5|as expected - looks great
B000VZF720|5|Works great. Nice mirror for the price
B00JA1C4MM|5|02 Impreza Wagon, 2.5l, Automatic. Good welds, good fitment. Clears my oil filter with no problem. Put 1500 miles on them already and no leaks or cracks yet. Bolts right up to stock cat. The sound is great. Cant complain! Glad i saved my money :)
B00CIVI6JQ|5|It took only a few minutes to install in our 1999 Honda Accord (4 cylinder) and worked perfectly. At 25% of the cost of parts stores.
B000C5YCZ2|5|fast shipping and fixed the check-engine light
B000CO9FF0|4|bought this elsewhere unfortunately amazon assumes that my 1985 635csi is the american model saying it wouldn't fit but this is as close to OEM as it is for the euro model light bulb.
B008D39Q1U|3|you cant beat price and service
B005PK1EAK|5|Works just like it's supposed to. Very happy with this product.
B002PQOCFG|2|light projection is uneven. passenger side very high into the trees. Looks light assembly itself looks great.<br /><br />UPDATE. After 1 year the lens is  flaking like there is a topcoat of clear plastic and it just lefts pealing off in tiny pieces.
B009B405PG|5|nice
B00K1IT98A|5|came as advertised and easy to apply.
B0095YZOO4|3|Didn't stick very well!
B009LN7PT6|4|Delivered on time and as expected.
B001Q399RA|3|I mounted this winch on my utility trailer. It paid for itself not too long thereafter. My riding mower engine literally exploded while cutting a friends lawn. The rear end locked up and I could not push it. I winched it up onto the trailer, although it didn't want to budge. The winch did as advertised. Needless to say I have a new mower. One bad thing about this winch is that the hand control components are made cheaply and with extended use heats up quickly and starts to burn out. I had to keep stopping and letting the handset cool (not the winch). I ended up having to fabricate a metal mount for part of the switch because the plastic mount failed. The winch motor sounds like it is coming apart but still works so far.
B0022XKSQ4|5|Had to make a blind decision about the height and chose wisely. this keeps bugs, wind and rain off me. perfect for the batwing.
B0018ICAMO|5|perfect fit, just took the angled tips off of my old ones and popped em on the new pair, fit like a glove.
B00V2XHMBY|5|These lights are extremely bright and gar overpower my headlights and my hella driving lights. Light color is bright white not yellow. Mounting brackets are very sturdy and wiring is straightforward and easy to install. After reading previous reviews I on sealed the ends applied RTV gasket sealant and reassembled to ensure water tightness. I would highly recommend this product for the price.
B004QPEJV6|3|Bigger than I expected, but usable.
B00LDS02O2|5|Made my car look like a porshe
B004P5G2GM|5|takes place for a second cup of coffee but my phone and pens and pencils.  recommend it highly.
B00G4RZZOE|4|Nice paint for the price
B004A329WU|5|good value
B003UW1IQU|4|this kit is a great starter kit , the pads are colored of importance which the packiging does not say but orang is a heavy cut pad , white is a medium cutting pad , blue is for polishes, black is for waxes and red is for sealents. the pad cleaning chemical is potent i use less than the recommended dilution bcause it works well. the microfibers are very plush a little to much for what i use but they have uses and are very durable. they includ the pad primer spray to lube the pad before applying to your paint which is water and another chemical but i use water and so does chemical guys on there video so nothing special but it works.<br /><br />now as for the 7424XP is a fantastic machine that is now upgradd to keep the switch from failing. as my older model did. this is a random orbital that has a medium throw so cant cut that fast if yur doing serious swirl removal. i feel the clutch is a little sensitive as it should be to novice users but in certain body lines i get annoyed at the light pressure i have to do. it does the job and a novice will learn the skills and have good control over it. but for serious work you will need a rotary or a rupes 21 style polisher. im very happy with it and the pads supplied
B00MV9OBE4|4|Same quality as OEM part!
B002N5J7YA|4|Works great, much better than the cheapo ones!  Recommend.

B008697KXC|2|It's a decent product but definitely cheap. Mine lasted about a month before it broke off (the H part broke off from the part connecting it to the ring). Oh well.
B00KYA0D12|5|Favorite sports bra!
B000KZ20HG|4|Not an original. No Toyota symbol in the back of alarm key. Besides that I followed the steps off YouTube and it works perfect. Thanks for such a discount.

B00CY1CJWU|5|Just an amazingly great product. I own two for our vehicles.
B00RB6V3YS|3|works  ok, i wouldnt recomemd it for any helmet other than a full face.  Sound quality is ok for a phone but will disapoint an audiophile.
B000ES8GLS|5|I received and installed the starter today and I am very impressed with the quality of the starter.  It looked and functioned like brand new for a fraction of the cost!

B00SBZAG5U|5|Nice...
B000XBD7A6|5|Great stuff !! It worked very well on my camper removing the campfire smoke, dirt and even did better on black marks than B.E.S.T Black streak remover which I feel like I wasted money on. I would highly recommend using it.
B00ZEJGDT4|5|I like it , looks good and with the magnet I can get out of my way when fulling.
B000COX0MY|5|Haven't used too many hitch pins in my day, but this one works fantastically.

B004AHQ558|5|Perfect fit and works perfectly at a great price.

B005BZDFAG|5|Perfect fit

B004OI21LK|5|GREAT REPLACEMENT JACK**** EASY TO INSTALL**** FIT MY COLEMAN/FLEETWOOD POPUP PERFECT****THANKS
B007RE534A|5|I bought this rack for my 2005 Arctic Cat 500 TBX.  It was missing the factory rear cargo box and this rack fit on the steel rack perfectly!  I used a piece of 1/4&#34; thick black rubber bed liner under it and it turned out great!  The rubber bed liner prevents any vibration between the steel atv rack and this aluminum rack on top.  It also made for a nice tight fit all the way around.  This Great Day Mighty Light Rack is very light and very well made.  It may cost a little more than steel racks, but it is worth it.  It won't ever rust and should outlast the atv!  5 stars!
B000CO8ANS|5|Very fast shipping and it was exactly what it was described to be! Thanks
B00KZ4EOLC|1|We ordered this item and all that was in the box was the wrap. The tool kit and instructions were no where to be found.
B003ZWL3KQ|5|Total satisfied

B00QB2ZFB0|3|it lost the color very fast
B00CO86Q5O|3|Cool item, love Star Wars. Although for the price I expected something more than plastic with stickers on it. Will add one more star after I see how long it lasts on my car
B00MEVO5U4|5|As cute in person as they are online!!!
B004GDBTDO|4|Decent replacement part. Not quite as nice as original factory but it works

B000CM3I96|5|Great Product
B00BD4YPEY|1|Very difficult to put on didn't fit my car right would never buy from them again
B011ICD2WQ|5|Ordered on a Sat and it was delivered on the following Mon!! Just in time too! I had a vehicle with 5 misfire codes and when I accessed Freeze Frame Data through this scan tool it pointed right to the problem. It saved me a couple hours of diagnosis right from the start. However, it is new so I will update my review as time passes.
B000BOALF4|5|I'm super happy with the whistles, deer nor any other animal have come out in the road in front of me.
B00PG2V14G|5|Good value for money.
B00VAVSNBG|5|Very good once I got them put on.
B00EC2CG9U|5|LOVE THESE!!!<br /><br />Thought I'd use only a few of them, but used almost ALL of them just in my one little tent (Hooligan 3 person)! Used to hang lanterns, mirror, sunglasses, keys, etc etc... just super easy. Gave one away to another person for them to hang their lantern in their tent too, and they loved it.
B004OLG2GW|5|Great item, received it fast
B00GM3FVLM|5|Great item
B003Z9UUUS|5|I've had this for over a month now and I am extremely happy with it. Looks great & Keeps everything in the bed dry and installation was less than 5 minutes no tools required. If I need the whole truck bed it takes about a minute to remove. 5 stars!!
B000C5HTAC|5|Received Ignition Key lock set on scheduled time. Worked perfect great price and qaulity
B00LNMZM5W|3|After putting these lug nuts on once and then taking them off to rotate tires a few weeks later i noticed that the chrome was chipping off where the lug nut contacts with the wheel itself.  They function fine, but with the chrome chipping off they might rust quickly.  I know they weren't over torqued too because I always tighten my lug nuts to the proper torque specs.
B0105MYC4C|1|These are NOT Kuryakyn brand. Be careful!
B000ZMXHDK|1|I wish i had read the one review on this product before purchasing so quickly. THIS IS ONLY ONE BULB!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS! Mine also burnt out shortly after installing. Not only is this deceiving but its crap product as well.
B007Y7QD4E|4|I bought these for my 2007 Dodge Ram 1500.  I love the look of them!<br /><br />The only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because one cover is bigger than the other.  They are not the same size!! Because one is bigger you can see wrinkles from the excess fabric and the seams don't line up.  The one that is the correct size, it fits perfectly.<br /><br />I don't want to go through the hassle of sending them back.  Guess I just have to deal with it....  :(  Bummer!<br /><br />LA Auto Gear is can always send me just one to replace the mis-fit if they wanted.  :)  Then I would send the mis-fit back!
B0002RNTSG|5|Striping paint off a car, works great.
B002M4GBG4|5|These are beautiful headlights!!! They work very well as they are on the car at this very moment. They were exactly as advertised and they came thru the USPS (I think it was USPS... not sure) in record time. I could not believe it they were shipped so fast.
B0083G3AXC|4|HANDY
B008B5X5GC|5|smooth transaction, great equipment at a very good price, fast shipment!
B000C9BZYO|5|good
B007H2PYKA|5|Good chair and the color is what I want for my patio. I love it.
B0044AZ44O|2|Got this for my 2013 Highlander.  Right off the bat you can see that the edge of this new filter are thicker, and the corners are not rounded the same way as the original filter.  Soooo....it doesn't fit right, it's too thick and the corners tend to want to stick out instead of fitting under the top cover, you have to try to force the top on and even then things don't seem to align correctly.<br /><br />I don't get it, though:  it came in what happens to be an original Toyota box, with the correct part number printed on the filter.
B009FUFCDQ|4|Left fuz on the windows
B006TMDC3A|5|Look great on my car
B003J9IXT4|1|No
B00I3RBWSQ|5|Great
B006X8BTWQ|3|The instructions were a bit difficult to understand, but im more of a &#34;see it and do it&#34; kind of guy as opposed  to read and do. I ended up using the hardware provided and mounted them how i wanted them and they still look good and is pretty sturdy.
B0002JMBX8|5|Perfect for the DIY jobs I'm capable of doing.
B0075HLMEO|5|Puuuurrrrrrrrfect!  I love the sticker. Nice quality too

B004GCN3BQ|2|Bumper came real fast, but didn't come with pieces that cover the holes on both sides of the bumper
B00NOAJK1S|5|Extremely bright! Even have purchased these for a friend!
B0007RS4BS|5|Bueno
B000C2536C|5|I have built many engines through the years (I used to work at a machine shop) and I haven't had a single part from sealed power that didn't work the way it was designed for and the price for the quality cannot be beat. Do yourself a huge favor and buy sealed power you will not regret it. Also in case you didn't know sealed power is a Federal Mogul company and they also make Felpro gaskets and most people consider them tops in the aftermarket for price and quality.
B00407V5B2|1|Do not use this product to respray a whole panel, or even a touchup its useless. bought it to respray front bumper with the dupli-color clear. you truly get what you pay for. The spray tips are the worst shooting blotches leaving drips. Buy a spray gun get a compressor and do it right. you wont be happy with the end result and yes i was looking for the cheap economical fix instead i got a disaster. i dont write reviews but i felt ppl should be warned.
B00A19XJTE|5|this thing is huge. I clipped it on my backpack instead of using it as a keychain. But it's super cute and I received lots of complements
B00E0ENW98|5|Finally got tired of the one wheel drive in our farm truck which is a 2004 Ford F250 Super Duty with a 10.5 rear differential!<br /><br />The Yukon Grizzly Locker solved that problem and now our truck can go places you probably shouldn't go :o)<br /><br />Installation was fairly straightforward but it helps to have an extra pair of hands when re-installing because of the weight involved and the shimming processing.  It took us three tries before we got the shimming correct and the ring gear basklash fell within the acceptable tolerance of 0.008&#34; - 0.012&#34;.  The stock shims didn't work for us unfortunately so I had to sort through the Yukon shim kit till we hit are required backlash tolerance.  Once the backlash tolerance was sorted, it was smooth sailing from there out!<br /><br />Here's so factory  torque specs for those who might tackle this job themselves ....<br /><br />Ring Gear Bolts - 111 ft-lb.<br />Bearing Cap Bolts - 88 ft-lb.<br />Rear Differential Cover Bolts - 33 ft-lb.<br />Rear Axle Fill Plug - 22 ft-lb.<br />Axle Hub Bolts - 80 ft-lb.<br /><br />Tools needed ...<br /><br />- Torque Wrench<br />- 1/2&#34; drive socket rachet + breaker bar<br />- 1/2&#34;, 18mm, 21mm sockets<br />- 3/8&#34; socket rachet (square drive for removing fill plug)<br />- Hi-Temp RTV Sealant (compatible with differential oil)<br />- SAE 75W-140 Differential Synthetic Oil<br />- Hammer & Punch for removing ring gear from old differential<br />- 2&#34; socket or there abouts for pressing on new bearings onto locker<br />- Hydraulic Press<br /><br />An air impact makes the job go much quicker ... just saying.<br /><br />- Remember to grease the axles up before re-inserting and use a bit of medium thread lock on axle hub bolts.<br /><br />- Mark bearing caps before removing so you can easily identify and replace them exactly as there were.  Punch marks do the trick!<br /><br />- You should be able to roll ring gear freely by hand and then once the axles and tires are installed by the tires once rear axle is jacked up off the ground.  Parking Brake needs to be released and Neutral needs to be selected!  Everything should roll smoothly before buttoning up differential cover!<br /><br />- Always check a few days after for any kind of oil leaks!<br /><br />- Apply RTV sealant to differential cover and allow to sit for 10 to 15 minutes.  Next, install differential cover and snug bolts down evenly till sealant just starts to squeeze out and then let sit for another 30 to 45 minutes ... then torque down evenly to required specs.<br /><br />- Don't forget to re-install your exciter ring when installing your old ring gear onto the Yukon locker or your speedometer won't work!  The exciter ring is the thin silver gear-like looking ring installed next to the backside of the ring gear.  Try not to damage or break the ring when removing or re-installing!<br /><br />Think that covers everything ... and good luck with your locker install if you choose to tackle it yourself.  It definitely worth the time and effort!lled by the tires once rear axle is jacked up off the ground.  Parking Brake needs to be released and Neutral needs to be selected!

B000CSWCAG|5|Saves the day if you get pulled over after puffing a couple.
B00RD4D9AO|4|Instructions sort of irrelevant but it was not too difficult to install. Didn't have an 18 mm socket. 19 mm too large. 3/4 &#34; worked fine. Go figure. Definitely recommend.
B0079GQKDE|5|very good tool
B00BITJPK8|4|Everything was great! Shipped quickly,arrived early. Fit exactly as described. Only the color was more gray than black and i think was an oversight on my part.
B0090IRKUG|5|Awesome product, I'm never using clay again.
B00WA3YLDM|4|Did the job, the graduation marks don't line up very well but that wasn't unexpected.
B00AC85QRC|5|Fast and easy to use. Cleans all sides of the chain at once, just wrap it around your chain and spin the wheel while holding the lead coil. Reverse direction one circuit and you're done. The brush is flexible and adjustable to fit your chain.
B0031779OE|5|ok
B007ANWAO4|5|Great product. The new applicator works much better.
B00F2NHVX4|5|Great product!  Allows the debris to float to bottom and cut down on swirls and scratches.

B005FLO5BY|5|works great on the 4 wheeler
B00252BYUG|5|Great quality air filter, high quality build with center support for stiffening the filter and soft rubber trim for sealing in the air box.
B00HFRE9HG|5|These are great! I had my local Toyota dealership install them. Took them 3 days to do it but they work great. I will be going back though to get a few kinks worked out. Those are: First: the DLR's on the Rostra's are on all the time after my '14 FJ has been started. On previous model years this would not be an issue since the FJ's DRLs would also be on then. But, on the 2014 model (and maybe some prior years) when the light control is switched to off ALL the lights are off. On my '08 as soon as soon the engine started the DRLs were on. There was no way to turn them off. So I am going back to see if they can tweak that so that the Rostra DRLs are on only when I activate the FJ's DRLs. Second: the driving lights on the Rostra will only turn on when I have the headlights switched to hi-beam. I will see if that can be adjusted so they come on anytime I hit the Rostra control to activate them.  I like the Rostra lights a lot. Other than the CAI and cat-back free-flow exhaust it's the best mod I have done / had done so far. The light from them is nice and bright. The construction seems very good and they are a very good match / replacement for the stock front bumper ends that did not have lights in them. I would recommend these to a friend for sure!
B00KLKJB9U|5|We put this on a 98 Honda xr100. No issues saved us a lot of money.
B000CB6DMQ|5|Great Product
B00F3J2FW4|5|Perfect fit. Look amazing. Must have for all jeep owners. These will protect my floor during all seasons. Don't hesitate.  Buy them, u won't be disappointed.
B00B6JZ996|4|Kind of a pain to put on. Gotta be slow and careful, and scrub those wheels really clean. Looks damn good though. Took me probably close to an hour but 100% satisfied with the result.
B00ABPRAN4|2|Ok. Had to trim it down a lot and it looks like regular contact paper with words on it.
B001UC72TY|5|Works great on my 2007 Hummer H3.
B008JORKP2|5|So glad I got this for camping since we had a fire ban.  It was perfect and such a good deal.  One of the best purchases as it would not have been the same if we didn't have a way to roast marshmallows.  It's like a real campfire without the hassle of wood and smoke.
B00FAUVU40|3|So okay
B0123AXR5E|5|nice
B001HBMKCC|5|Great polish. Will not ever buy another polish other than this. Easy to use with fantastic results
B0052LQQFK|5|The Ultimate is the best bead seat around by far.  Inventors are Iron Butt riders who know how to be comfortable all day in the saddle.<br /><br />Cool under my bottom and constant rider motion does not allow pressure points to build up in any specific place.  Beats the Air Hawk too, by far.  First one lasted 80,000+ miles until lost in an accident.
B00QWYO5A4|5|Very nice
B00H5F2UO2|5|Great. Thanks!
B00WL0AXDG|5|These running boards are basic, yet functional.  They look great on my 2015 Silverado, and took about two hours for me to install by myself.  I like the fact that there is no chrome to oxidize or get beat up by sand and gravel thrown by the tires.  The instructions were quite good too.  Sorry, the photo is not the best, but given how bright the sun was that day, I took the picture in my garage!
B00D9BFR8M|4|Partner uses it and has had no problems so far.
B00IZNZOYQ|5|I work in a tire/lube shop, of course we have the &#34;name brand&#34; tool trucks that swing by every week and were asking waaaay to much for this tool. I've used this thing at least 5 times a day for the last month or so and it has been great.
B000WPEZGS|5|Perfect aftermarket adapter for my bike. Once I got them in, they have the same performance as the original pegs.
B00407GSG4|5|Fits perfectly, very happy with it.
B00CFCHT0U|1|Worst car floor mats ever purchased. We've had them for several months now, and they slide around the car, which is not only horrible looking, but dangerous. They absolutely don't fit the car as they said they would. Very cheaply made. Would never buy again. Very disappointed in this as an Amazon product.
B00429Y8ZI|2|The light lasted for about 2 months.
B00466AJ6Y|5|Awesome, my third buy from  this company worth every penny
B00MO8OIQI|5|Perfect fit 2006 300c  hood!
B0081S8X7A|5|Perfect thank you
B009LPXTYE|5|Really well made sticker only thing i didn't realize it is not a one piece sticker so took a little longer to place and line up but wasn't that bad
B000IY5Y7W|5|Thanks for shipping so fast. Great for the price.
B005ZGLGF2|5|Super quick shipping.  Perfect product.
B00BGI6SOW|5|Fit very nice good quality
B0036E9VB6|4|I love my new ViAir 85P,<br />the product is very quiet, doesn't blown any fuse on my 06 Ford Escape 2.3 XLS and the brass fittings doesn't draw any residual air when you screw it into the tire valve, the gauge is nice to have but you have to turn off the pump to get the approximate readings, the LED lights will immediately turn on when you plug it to the 12v power source. it is also very compact in size.<br />this product doesnt have a bag so keep the box and use it as storage.
B00DSR48NC|5|Item is perfect, fits my car floor like a glove. I love the vibrant color and its exactly what I wanted, got the car seat cover package as well. Great company to purchase from.
B004K9BIY4|5|GOOD
B000GV6VKQ|5|great product and great service
B000C1KBVK|5|pleased with purchase.
B002UC6PWS|5|good to have on hand as they break easily
B000E3EXH4|4|Reasonable price, still will be warm like a leather seat on hot summer time. Also you have problems if your seat has arm rest . I had to rip it on the side to fit beside arm rest
B000GTVOJQ|5|Lifesaver. For the price, it's got a huge benefit. It also let me know that my hash marks are dead-on.
B00RM327NG|4|Works well but its fitment and usefulness depend on the design and placement of your car's air vents.
B004GCOZNG|5|Fit perfectly looks original. all I did was put some black paint on it.
B000182DMO|1|I would never order another Flowmaster product......I ordered straight from Flowmaster....terrible customer service and policies from Flowmaster.
B000N3H728|5|Great pricing, quick service!
B00MV8XWHM|2|Product came just like they show in the picture. My issue is, they broke off within the first week. When they are on, they work great.
B0040D2QVE|2|It look as the same but they did not fit rigth
B0013V6M7U|5|Got this for my dad who is an avid golfer...he loves it!
B0002U2V1Y|5|Excellent product. Works as advertised. Delivery was drama free<br />Car now feels like glass when you run your fingers across the paint. This is after washing, claying, and waxing.
B006JTP4PM|5|The lights r great
B0030CC2XI|5|Look like stock, but don't have Jeep logo.
B00DTOFGVW|5|MSR products are very well made. excellent value too.
B00WU0BHUA|5|if you have a atv or utv you have to have this stuff. I buy it by the case. I spray it on everything topside, underside, tires, seats. it makes water bead and you can do 75% of your cleaning with a water stream only. don't let the box fool you it says racing oil. the product is sc1 clear coat.
B00YB5GAEA|5|Great Bike tailight, bright and visible. Being rechargeable is tremendous!
B00QJNDK72|1|could have got these tires for $89 rocky mountain $45 less
B0030Q259U|5|It performs just the way supposed to
B001FY56T0|5|Fits great and easy to install.
B00HMR54NC|5|The round bushing is hard to install if you don't use a little creativity. No you do not have to cut in half, in fact it takes away from the snug feeling this part has. However, it can be a beast to install. I had to make a brace out of wood to install this with a C-clamp. It worked well. However, I spent an hour to install the circle bushing. (No creative inspiration.) I have pictures of the installed part and the contraption I made. I will add them later after I take some pictures. The last person to do work on the bushing killed the treads that hold it on though. I have to get a new bracket later, but the part installed great, and fits snug. The rear bushing was easy to install, but because someone rounded the bolts off, I had to use a extractor to get them out. The bolts that came with this fit well and were easy to finger tighten before applying some torque to them. Overall, this was a good part and nice to replace my completely chopped up front bushing and really worn rear bushing. I just have to wait till I get the new U-Joint bushings before I can comment on the overall stability and the like. This kit was installed on a 96 Subaru Legacy Brighton.
B0084HJL06|5|for my daughter
B001BRYTYY|5|I have a pretty underpowered car, so this was a very cost efficient way to give it a little boost. It was easy to install, reasonably priced. Anyone looking for just a little bit of a boost for just a little bit of $$, K&N is the way to go.
B00W4B4PVS|5|Great product... Was easy to setup and works like a charm
B00P5YMO50|5|Very good.
B00GSAUHB8|4|My husband has big size truck .<br /><br />It's perfect size for protect from sun
B00X8BKVSY|5|exactly as I expected.
B009ZGENJ4|4|They fit great. They are exactly what I was looking for
B008UUQB4Q|1|Does not do its job.  Provides too much voltage to the battery, this is very bad because it can cause the battery to explode.  I do not recommend this product.  Spend at least $100 for a heavy duty one.
B00C43BOTM|5|price is right. some places charge this amount for just a quart.
B00B0Q60C0|4|Perfect fit! Thanks
B0061R3CQK|5|These work really well, easy to fit and give a good rear view.
B00GYS8U4U|5|My Application was a 2002 BMW e39. I used them to replace my Incandecent factory license plate lamps. They have been in for about 30 days now. No flickering during the system bulb check, and no warning on my cluster. They look nice, color temperature appears to be as specified, Happy to find something that works without any modifications.
B003VDX5D2|3|Works, installation is time consuming, tie down system needs improvement
B000C9Y0PK|5|I buy these every year and they work wonderfully
B003VAWNVK|5|I have purchased a PD 52 to replace the one on my 2014 Winnebago Adventurer Motor home.  It is the exact replacement, but I have a few suggestions.  To avoid the connections loosing up and causing the box to arc I would add &#34;lock-tight&#34; to each connection especially if you travel a lot.  Great buy, worth every penny.
B0009PCPNQ|5|I am a believer!! This stuff works miracles!
B0018E4SEG|5|Great product and fast shipping. A+
B00C2M05S6|5|Good quality product
B000IZ0XKY|5|right part good price
B000XBCURW|5|I use the product on the convertible top of my BMW. As soon as you apply it, you will notice a difference! Product goes on with a matte finish, but deepens the color (mine is blue) of the convertible top, and repels water.
B0002MBDE8|5|Cool
B006STTIVY|5|This is a great nozzle
B001DRE70I|5|Fit perfectly.
B00I4CLY6A|4|Worked as advertised
B000637TNM|5|Love the way this has restored my favorite saddles and bridles.  I will definitely order again!
B000OAG2DK|5|Such an upgrade from the standard shower head that came in our camper!  We loved it so much that we bought one for my parents' camper also!!!
B005X4QCAA|5|Works great. The speedometer is broken in an older car I own, so this was a cost-effective alternative.
B00BB1V5CY|5|Fits perfectly and looks great. Nice heavy quality too. You do have to remove factory carpets to get these to click in and be stable.
B004R35M6S|5|Easy to install, fit nice and tight to the rear bumper cover and doesn't stick out much. Install took about 15 minutes.
B00UM9X63C|5|I didn't see any reviews for these gauges but Bosch is a good brand so I took a risk. Gauges are extremely responsive. Looks great. Comes with clear directions. Back lights are sufficient (but I noticed the light on my autogage vac meter was brighter). Great price! I am very pleased.
B007WWVWQ0|4|This is definitely machined aluminum and not cast fir and finish was perfect I did clean, port and deburr a few areas for a smoother transition. Perfect amount of hose also I was left with about 1 ft left over. It wouls be nice if it came with 2 -8an adapters for the oil filter adapter like it does for the oil filter bypass. If some is going -an lines the adapter has -8an to 1/2 npt adapters for the filter bypass already. You just need -8an to 3/8 npt for the filter adapter mount. Push lock -8an works perfect with the 1/2 hose. I used oem style snap clamps for a cleaner appearance and to ensure no leaks.
B00O4Q98OA|1|They are loose, sloppy, and poorly manufactured. I will not order axles from gsp in the future!
B0002ILK6I|5|Works great on my AE86! Still cranking strong two years later.
B002PUS7Y4|5|Worked great for my camper! Thanks for sending so quickly!
B00B2B466K|5|Installed this in my backyard laying in the dirt. and everything went smoothly. lift seems very well built.  Has been on my TJ now for about a year and no problems with the kit at all. Just make sure you go back and tighten all the bolts again in a few miles  then again after a week or two of wheeling .... they will slowly loosen up over time.  Great product.
B00IKPVM54|5|One of the packs on 2003 Toyota Echo broke and I needed a fast and affordable replacement.  This pack does the job.
B00BFDIFGC|4|Little long from oem
B009JMCXE6|5|One of the dealer parts guys said I had to buy the entire window to get this part.  This worked perfectly.
B001HZPWG4|3|not heavy duty enough for a 6 cylinder car which is very heavy in the front.
B00D3E1E6O|5|excellent
B00T89WG2Y|5|Excellent turbocharger. It works, great buy......love it
B001IGE6ZK|5|Great for all small needs. I like the compact design. They are very useful with my wheelchair
B00804IETW|5|Fits my Subaru and my suit jacket.
B007A3K7G2|1|Poor material made did not hold up to winds at 40 miles a hr.
B0031I9KV8|5|Great rotors. Good price. Fast shipping. I would buy these again
B00DSOUG5E|5|Wow, what a product.<br /><br />I purchased this so I could communicate with my daughter as she is learning to ride.  Intercom works great and is crystal clear at speeds up to 70 mph using a full faced helmet.
B009IF1S72|5|Works perfect and after a few months still is doing good. Easy to install
B000BTCWS8|5|great decal, but very very tricky to get on your window... BE PATIENT DOING THIS!
B0000AY3DS|2|I guess for the low price it functions,however the construction is plastic and the mirror quality is poor.  Just a piece of film
B00FBP5FWM|5|As expected. This case was exactly what I needed!
B00FFGX9X4|5|Perfect
B000C7YBMY|5|Perfect relay for my ford explorer 2wheel drive 1995 truck , one of the relays burned our and I bought this relay but with a concern it wont work but it work like magic !<br /><br />Definitely buying more to replace the old one
B001U8R6EO|5|So much more cost effective than going to the dealer!
B000CGTP3U|5|perfect and exact for my 3.5 olds
B003YJJZNW|1|Too messy.
B005CLKKRU|5|Great product and price
B003VASIGO|4|Good quality material.  Heavy duty. Easy to install.  Very pleased.
B00NBN1C78|3|This product, like all has it's pros and cons.  I will do my best to list them.  There are several pros.  It mounts easy on the trailer.  It packs together nicely in the box which is important.  It has multiple sizes of lug wrenches.  The cons are that the lug wrench may not be long enough to get a good torque on the lug nuts.  I am just glad I have my husband to change tires, because I have arthritis in my hands, so he is the one that tested this out.  The jack base is small, so bring a board to set it on.  I gave this product three stars for the above reasons.
B00HE6CI58|5|Installed in  2002 NISSAN SENTRA SER : DOME LIGHT<br /><br />After dealing with cheap bulbs that burn out every few months I turned to these and my verdict is they are a must have upgrade. Installing these is no different than installing your ordinary incandescent bulb. Lumen output is a big improvement, in my opinion these are easily twice as bright as their counterparts, and they have a clean white color. Light spray will be determined by the enclosure they are installed in but in my dome light they produce a surprisingly wide angle of light. No flickering, dimming, or LED failure over the course of the last 9 months. Very robust when put up against the punishing vibrations of a sub-woofer, 9 months and still going strong. In my opinion you cannot buy a better LED bulb for this price.
B002305YJ2|4|Works well
B0069258XM|5|Did not fit
B00UNRU5KK|4|The quality of this cover is pretty good. I should have ordered one or two sizes smaller for a longbed pick up. I ordered a size larger after reading the reviews, but this cover is very oversized. Maybe for an SUV,  with the height of the cab, you would need a larger size- otherwise a very loose fit.
B004Q3OEV8|3|The bottom part of the seat will not stay on<br />I will have to buy some sheet suspenders to keep the seat cover in place
B0089LT54O|5|Put this into my car and it feels like it runs better since the old one turns super super black.
B00HEBPNDM|1|Electric module would not fit the socket. The washer tip broke when attaching the washer hose. Sent it back.
B005HJMX4U|5|magnet could be stronger.
B001O5RF1M|1|I would not buy another set from this company, the fit was real bad. I know some times you may have to make thing fit , but you should not have to add more tape to hold the corners down and file the front window's piece down to a knifes edge just to keep the window from catching it and not going up all the way. I have put window ventvisor in before and never had this much trouble. If I would have known it was going to take that much work, well I should have sent them back. the old saying, you get what you pay for, try giving them away, if that don't work tape a five dollar bill to them. I know this a bad review, but I think the company could fix the mold to correct it.
B00LNNR9GG|5|These fit perfectly in my 2016 Ford Explorer.  They made the fog lights a nice bright white
B0049GLHG2|2|Denso's tag line is first time fit. Well this product is anything but an OEM replacement for my 2005 Sienna XLE AWD. It was different is several key areas that made installation a real pain.<br /><br />1. The original had a aluminum side tanks that were flat with with front of this radiator that allowed the condenser and it to fit into the brackets that hold it into place, while this had plastic tanks that would not allow the combo to fit into the brackets.<br />2. The height of this radiator was about 1/2 an inch less than original.<br />3. The original had bolt holes on the top and bottom that allowed it to be bolted to the brackets, while this had nothing but a groove.<br />4. The drain location is not directly on the bottom but on a stud that sticks out about 1.5 inches which will not allow it to drain through the hole in the framing.<br /><br />I should have gone with the cheaper alternatives as they would not have been any more work. I bought this because I was expecting an easier installation. In the end I had to fabricate wooden strips to fit in the top and bottom groove on the radiator to be able to bolt it into the brackets.
B0043OV0IA|4|good power, handy.
B00SJLD8MY|4|Does the job
B0126YHPQY|5|These LED lights look kind of funny, but work great! They give a nice bright white light, which is great for your backup lights. They can also be used for your brake or turn lights. Easy to install and work great!  I received this item free for review.
B001JKXJF8|4|Fits good enough.
B00573N36S|5|Love it! Shows off my Disney side everyday. Helps me spread smiles. ;~&#62;
B004A6OARE|5|Everything was as expected. Will order from these folks again if I need something they have.
B0091OE6K6|4|I'm a small woman who drives a big truck and these do alright. I wish they would stay permanently in position, but they are probably more adjustable this way. The seatbelt isn't perfect with this on-- it slides and moves where the belt starts going up as, as opposed to changing the angle of the chest belt-- but it no longer cuts into my neck, so I'll call it a win.
B004I14AKS|5|So far so good
B00KTI0KKI|1|Didn't work with my car
B00DGEYGYS|4|Perfect
B004I12424|5|Worked great!!!
B00NUCJ948|4|Works like a charm. Seems a bit cheaply made. But has held up so far. Only issue is at times I have to back out when I pulled it as the items motion sensor doesn't turn on the laser. But once I come in the garage again it turns on. Other times it works as described. Would buy this again.
B00KZJQ2L2|2|much too large<br />Made for a truck windshield.
B00LCBLTA6|5|Great
B004KK553I|1|Loved the product when it arrived, it came very fast and it was convenient.<br />About a month or so in the diamonds started faling off. Now it being a year later, there is a total of about 20 crystals left. A bit disappointing, but you get what you pay for.
B00KDMKWIK|4|Zero fitment issues with mine. Sounds like a quieter Tanabe Medallion Touring.  Tips are a little too recessed under the bumper for a G35 coupe.  But, for the price... can't complain much.
B0049GJJ1C|5|excelent product
B005DLLVMW|5|Arrived on time and as described.
B00I1B6MX4|5|Excellent product. Easy installation. Works perfect. No more knots on my head.  Thank you.
B00WOT3YM6|4|This inflator had been a lifesaver.  It does overheat and will shut off, but let it cool down and it will start back up.  Don't trust the gas station air machines my tires were way underflated.  It comes in a great carry case.  Worth the money!
B000GKAZCW|2|The flasher works fine, the only downside I have with it is, the clicker is very, very faint. and if your install is close to the firewall in the interior of the car cabin, or buried deep under the dashboard of the car. you will barely hear this flasher.
B000QJJ4LG|5|Love it! Put it on my 2001 jeep Cherokee sport
B00FA43C9C|3|i think it is a little over priced, i have a problem with the rubber ring around the mirror staying on and thats all that keeps the mirror in place. im sure using 3m weatherstripping adhesive will fix the problem
B0055AW0N0|5|words great......  but can't put tall drinks in it.
B000TYSBZ8|5|Excellent, no more shorting out bulbs, no more non-blinking turn signals. these sockets are well worth the  more then fair price their selling for on Amazon. I would highly recommend them to everybody. the extra marking light wire with socket some cars don't need like mine didn't. you can disconnect this from the main socket if you don't need. the two wires just unplug, it has nothing to do with main socket. these replace sockets at a part store were selling for 20.00 a piece, and close to $35.00 at a dealer. and they we're the same as these.  I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend to everyone  to save the money and buy these.
B005GJWMWO|4|Fits over my gear. Breathes well. Got stuck in a massive storm in Colorado and the only area that was wet was around the zipper on the legs.
B00N9HP97U|3|This is one of the better cost ripoffs due to poor design that ran for maybe one or two years.
B000BOA9RY|5|Works great Good to keep in your toolbox To make sure your car keeps running cool
B00CTR9WTC|5|nice
B006VEHO8U|5|Great foam cushions for your seatbelt
B004QPA57S|5|Good stuff
B000COHAX4|5|great buy for the money
B00HJ1VM28|4|it worked like a charm
B0019I8W7U|5|PERFECT , VERY INEXPENSIVE
B00I4CLY6A|5|works great
B0050I3DC4|5|Excellent product...
B00BKTXSSG|5|love it
B007XZK85C|5|Perfec
B00FR2JF0W|3|It gets loose very quickly!
B00OP6VHK2|1|The product fell apart on me after one use. I did get a full refund but it was not worth the time and effort.
B000IY49X2|5|Great rotors. Quiet and the epoxy coating should hold back the rust.
B0055DV5WY|4|Great
B0093WX7NI|5|Does the job
B009RTJO4I|5|works great
B0029L4YA0|5|Great product.  Keeps SUV interior clean.
B0009PSJ22|3|works well in my small daily driver.
B004UOE8XC|4|It comes very near to the Hummer equipment. I did not like the stick on letters provided.
B00CUQQA3I|4|Fit perfectly.  Easy to install
B0077FK7WM|5|Great seller and fast shipping. Was perfect for my 134a conversion on a 91 CRX. Very minimal modification to make it fit. You just have to flange out the sheet metal where lower connection is slightly with a pair of pliars to prevent rubbing, but thats it.
B000S2IUES|5|One of the easiest installations every. The fit was a direct fit and simple to change out. Changing this part will be standard for all future AC jobs that I do.
B00CJFLOJU|2|Amazon vehicle compatibility checker said these would work on my BMW and they did NOT work.  I sent them back, they appear to be good quality, nothing against the product itself so keep that in mind.  They just were useless to me since they didn't actually fit.
B00A4F4ML4|5|looks like its apart of the truck.....very sharp
B007X4FD7Q|5|They came well packaged, they fit as well as the OEM bulbs, and they emit light when you ask them to.  A winner all around.
B003ZKKMLE|5|i've read bad reviews about some of these cables, but this one hasn't failed me!!  great job on a quality addition to my tool collection!!
B00IKMHRZQ|5|Came on time worked great!
B0096B9RFI|5|Thanks!!
B009F10S3Y|5|good but last a shirt time if you scrape
B000M5NNQ6|5|Best source I could find.  Price was better than locally by a long shot.  Arrived quickly.  No problems.
B00CLLQYCE|1|Was easy to instal but it already quit working again so something else is wrong with it i guess
B001HYQSE0|1|Caused mechanical problems, stay away
B00K2G5I40|5|Fits a lil big in a 2008 Toyota Corrolla but well worth the buy.Love this product! Its cheaper than the regular all grey sunshade at autozone and its for my fqv superhero!
B007NVQ13E|4|Works great, and makes my wife happy.
B0051WVPB0|4|worth the price
B00KWQRC4O|1|There's nothing holding the tissue box so it just falls right out the side. Great concept, poor execution. I returned this item.
B00F5QFRI4|5|Very good, and I am pleased with purchase.
B00LH58MV6|3|Looks better on line. .
B00068OR8M|4|IT'S OKAY FOR NON-FUEL INJECTION.  IF RUST FLAKES IN YOUR TANK ARE STOPPING UP AND MESSING UP YOUR FUEL PUMPS,<br />THEN YOU NEED TO PRE-FILTER YOUR GAS!! EASIER TO CHANGE A FILTER THAN A FUEL PUMP. RUST FLAKES CAN RUIN THE<br />DIAPHRAM IN YOUR FUEL PUMP.. THEY CUT INTO THE RUBBER DIAPHRAM.... PRE-FILTER THE GAS GOING INTO THE FUEL PUMP UNTIL YOU CAN SERVICE OR REPLACE YOUR GAS TANK...
B00RSOX5BC|5|Works. Very stylish with the blue lights around sockets.
B000CRAXU8|1|Purchased in Nov. 2014, and lo & behold here on Aug. 2015 it is defective. Their Amazon warranty is only 30 days. So the same part thru O'reilly's is 1 year. What goes?  Small difference in cost parlayed a BIG diff. in warranty. Next time I'll go with O'reilly's. At least they stand behind their parts!!!!
B0040CTTH4|5|I installed a backup camera on my 2013 Kia Forte5 and in the process of removing some of the rear panel pieces I broke 2 retainer clips. I really hate to shop on Ebay, but they seemed to be the only place that sold Kia specific retainer clips, however shipping was going to be 3+ weeks and I didn't want to wait.<br /><br />I found these little gems for around $5 with free shipping and noticed another Kia owner had used them and typed up a reivew. They aren't the EXACT same size as the ones I removed; I think they have a smaller diameter head, but they slide into the panel piece and fit into the holes with a sturdy snap.<br /><br />Since installing these two clips I've had to go in and make adjusts to my back up camera wiring and of the 3 times I've removed the panel the clips have stayed attached to the panel as they should. I've not experienced any rattling or looseness. Very pleased!
B004323RTW|4|I recommend buying the 50' size instead of this 25' hose.  We bought this size because we didn't want it to take too much room in the boat, but it is very compact.  Even stretched out it retains some of the coil shape so the actual distance it covers is about 15'.  Otherwise, it's a very good hose.
B00KTLZPS2|4|My kids love it,good little economical mini bike.
B009AQS5H0|5|Looks great on my car! In AZ we have really hot summers & monsoons & my license frame has not rusted or changed color. I would recommend this product to everyone.
B008BRJ5FA|5|I plugged it in, it lit up
B004SRRY4Q|2|This is my 3rd LeBra for the same car, Hyundai Sonata, and I'm keeping it, but I am not happy with the fit.<br /><br />Unlike the others, this one does not seem to be right for my model. the nose of the bonnet is wrinkled and loose-fitting, 1 of the wheel well clips does not engage, on both right and left side. And finally, I had to drill 2 holes and use screws to hold the clip in place inside the hood.<br /><br />I would contact the seller to ask them to check my order, and possibly they sent me the wrong one, but there is no &#34;contact seller&#34; button on the amazon site.
B000EDQQD8|5|No more leaks, the old unit stopped  showing the pressure.  This one works fine
B000JFNAMQ|5|Works good easy to use. Can weigh postal mail as well as my 2 yr old.
B000OI8ECY|3|There was nothing wrong with the product itself, but the AMAZON site said this will fit your 2014 F-150 XLT  Crew Cab. Well it's for a extended cab, so I had to send it back and get one for a Crew Cab
B00026Z3EA|5|great product for price
B00XB3WM7W|5|Looks great on my VW Passat TDI
B004I0L1KQ|5|Item was just as described and easy to install.
B00OAD9Q5I|4|Nice lights. Gives off a much brighter and clean white look than the originals. Has a very slight blue hue. You'll notice the blue when you flip on the high beams. They're cool and its hard to really complain at that price point.
B00J2GK5I0|4|Work great  thanks
B000BZIYG6|5|all good
B00139WO9C|4|Did the job and not too costly. Not heavy on features and not digital, but a bargain at the price.
B008G3KC1U|4|Great fit. I was very pleased with packaging as well. Unfortunately **HARDWARE IS NOT INCLUDED** there was a protective plastic over the headlights to help prevent dirt and scratches till they are replaced overall very pleased.
B00LEBLI82|1|Not as large as I expected. Had bought one & it was much better.
B0016IJ1OG|5|Good, really good.
B00N39ACHQ|5|Work great , very strong love them .
B003M6HCL4|5|neat and nifty, they are bigger than i thought they would be.
B001H1I7Z6|4|Quality touch up paint ,dries quickly and comes with a tiny brush on top.
B00EB8EB2K|5|Great product, same as factory.. Work's perfect, and fits exact..
B00W4IDIGE|1|Never buying this again
B00EEG9X18|2|Looks great and fits well. But my passenger side high beam doesn't work, and I have an LED light out on the drivers side
B009098DKG|5|Nice.
B00BPUOS4I|4|Perfect fit ...
B009DJTQJU|5|Perfect fit
B009S9RO9Y|5|Really looks great on my truck
B009EQJL8I|5|Great shoes
B002QS6ZSK|5|product works great
B00AZABHLQ|5|Must have tool
B00HE1BQWY|5|I used this to replace a broken remote on a 2007 Malibu. A remote by itself was going to cost $15 and a local locksmith charges $45 to program remotes. I bought this and another remote off Amazon and programmed them both with this product. It took less than five minutes and simple to follow instructions. Beware the module can only be used a max of three times so you cannot go into business with this product. So I ended up saving a few dollars and saved a trip to the locksmith. Great easy to use product.
B009D978VS|4|Decent summer only jacket.  Fits well, soft to the touch.  Velco is cheap and wont last long.
B009216FO8|4|Fits the Shoei QWEST helmet visors just fine. I found the strap unnecessary and cut it off, but otherwise it is great. Much better than keeping the spare visor in the helmet bag.
B00EZE8QQM|5|Works good, but unfortunately it didn't line up with my Toyota housings and I had to silicone it in.
B004JQJD5E|5|My boat has a ton of slip.  I was worried that this propeller would be overkill but with the slip it pushes the boat like I wanted.  Ebbtide Campione 195 4.3 190 hp mercruiser alpha one.  Raised the mph by 10 and didn't reduce hole shot noticably compared to Spitfire 14x21p sold on amazon.  Still 25% (vs 30%) slip but pushes the boat like I expect it to go and doesn't hit rev limiter.  48 mph vs 38 mph.
B008MYQB4U|5|great product,fits perfect
B0040D2QVE|2|did not fit
B0023VFUWM|5|Wow! The tail light we ordered fit perfectly on 1st. try. And we only needed one screwdriver. Following the site ordering instructions were very easy thus making our experience an experience since we are not computer folks, Thank you
B00538TU8C|5|just what i needed
B00L8TA2T6|1|Bout to return because after a week I have moisture in the bar
B004960WO0|5|A plus part and service
B00KOEBYRU|5|work good on my boat
B00NX8EYFI|5|This is even more adorable in person!! Shipped & delivered so quickly too! Couldn't be more pleased w/ purchase.
B002O06Z80|5|Fit my 01 escape well
B0054YCW62|5|A plus part and service
B00JFOVPV0|5|this size was hard to find in a store, exactly what I was looking for!
B0001MQ7E0|4|This Koolatron done Fantastic job for us while we were on our small vacation. kept everything nice and cold
B006QLIF9A|5|These headlights are great, the housing is made a little different though, i pulled my old ones out no problem but had to loosen bumper bolts and let it hang to get the new ones back in to the space, not a big deal. I used with Sylvania silverstar (the most expensive ones) and they are great, had to adjust the level but worth it considering my turn signals were brighter than my headlights used to be.
B004VFFIHK|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B008KWP84I|5|The nit on the end of it makes for easy install in tight space
B001FCJW38|4|Pretty happy with this buy. Bought it for my fiancee to put on her Xterra. Got it in two days after I ordered it. No damage to the bar at all. Super easy to put on. Took about 15 minutes. Fits perfect (2013 Nissan Xterra) and didn't have any problems putting it on, though it is a little loose feeling before you tighten the bolts. so you want to have a friend told it in the position you want it. Gives it a little bit of an aggressive look.   &#34;Note to anyone with road rage or looking to buy for an actual guard of any type. This isn't what you want. This is just all for looks over function.&#34;
B005FO31UM|5|Perfect fit
B00IS93BCE|5|Great bumper for the price. Fits perfect. Very strong and steady.
B00KLIWMCU|5|The SKORCH shade fits our Honda Fit well (and the Honda Fit has a big windshield!). I appreciated the protective case, through don't plan on using it too much since it's so sunny out! The folding was surprisingly easy to figure out and it folds down to a small size for storage (I keep it under my seat for easy access)
B004DJ0AHM|5|Although this is adjustable, they definitely should have used the Velcro on the outside so you don't have to turn tricks to get the size changed.  When you've got a big onion it's hard to adjust the last 1/2 inch.  :-)  I do love the hat though!!!
B004TBKQU0|1|I luv them !!!
B0002UHWEK|3|Works well, but over priced.
B008BRJ5FA|5|Worked great
B00E5PK8TE|4|Bike started fine after installation. But it was tough getting the spacers to stay in place when screwing the bolts into the posts.
B00S92Q8E8|5|These came quickly and seem very warm. Unfortunately it's so warm here it's hard to wear them for long, but I'm en route to the Arctic ocean and will update with how they hold up there in a month or so. The design is great, the fabric &#34;hinge&#34; allows comfort with the face part either up or down, and they are nice and soft. Slightly chemical smell, but it's mostly gone after a run through the washing machine. Even the warmer nordic version is definitely thin enough to do fine under a hat or helmet.
B0093A9JIW|4|Fits the window perfectly and stays in place.<br />Only draw back is it is pretty big to store. I don't  have any kids in the back seats, I just kinda toss it there for easy access.  I would have to keep it in the cargo area if I have any passengers.<br />Minor detail, it's  worth it to me for the good secure fit!
B00CEX44F8|5|fantastic,I love them
B00MYI53IK|5|Good quality but did not fit my jeep
B00FQPY5PA|5|Awesome product it saved me from buying he expensive full kit
B000HLO936|5|Delphi , what can I say great product , great price
B00CFCI30K|3|The color is not tan like they say on here. The color is like a green brown. My car is brown so it kind of matches but I would have rather gotten this in tan color. Besides the color, the material looks very good quality.
B004RFKBEO|5|this bike rack worked perfect for our daughters motor home.  Had it together in 45 minutes.Very happy withit
B00L9NHYGK|5|I love it! Even though it chugs my gas
B013FDOBZS|5|Wow!  I would never have expected such a tiny handheld device to be so effective!  I have used my airgun on 3 cars now.  I used the rechargeable battery once and used the 12 unit accessing my power plug in my dash.  Both forms of power were amazing!  The air gun, slightly smaller than my cordless drill set, was easy to learn and very easy to use!  Simply touch the display button, pick your form of measure..for me it was psi..then select your pressure. .screw on the tip and press the trigger!  A minute if so later..it turns itself off and your tire is inflated!  I will think of this device as the holiday season comes around!
B0024E6V30|5|Nice filter and I have been using them to fill my sailboat tank.  I will have to confess the water has a much nicer taste to it.  I run the hose for a bit before I connect the filter and then send to the tank.  I also fill a few jugs with it.  The water seems to have a fresher taste to it..
B00FRT77GO|5|This is a great addition to my Dodge Truck. Look as good as factory decals.<br />This is also a good quality vinyl for the price.<br />If you do not know how to install this type of decal, I would advise you have someone that does.<br />The majority of these decals that turn out looking bad are from poor installation.<br />I would attach a photo of what it looks like on my truck but there is no option for it.<br />Highly Recommended!!
B009Z3E3N8|5|Very vibrant colors and perfect size.
B000C9WL6A|5|Weighs at least 3 times the original filter..that means more metal and more filter..it was also $3.00 less than the cheap one from the dealer and I didn't have to drive across town to get it
B00M42CLXQ|1|Poor fit, one of the steps sat at an angle once installed.  They are priced right for what they are, I guess I just expected more.  I ended up returning them.
B004GDWHEY|5|Perfect fit,<br />you got to do some welding
B001DR9WCQ|5|perfit fit
B0054YE8AU|5|Covers my trailer when I go to the dump.  What more needs to be said!
B001KSGHJE|4|Merci
B000GTUM9O|5|great windshield
B00E1SNXW4|5|When I ordered the brakes from Amazon the website said it would take 7-10 days for the brakes and rotors to get to my house. It was 4 days. They were a perfect fit for my 2010 T&C. I have had them on for about 1 month now and there is hardly any evidence of brake dust. The deafening squeal is gone and the stopping power is incredible. I am going to order some for my back breaks now. Callahan products ROCK!
B000GZEU82|1|Defective product
B000BQMZ60|5|Very good product.  They fit nicely and they were easy to install.
B011B25IXY|5|Good quality wash gloves.  Looking forward to many good car washes.
B00I87ZXM2|5|Does what it should, beats cranking em
B00DUFC9E2|5|It's a much better quality than previous covers I have purchased at a similar price.
B00QRD0BNU|3|Many of the pieces are not similar to those on my '97 Honda VFR. They work individually, but are not what I was completely looking for.
B00BFWJYF4|1|Returned. I suspect these are seconds. At least the ad on pads might me.
B000CQBG1O|5|Used to over the exhaust on my old CR-V. Fit just like the old one that I was replacing. Great price and shipping speed from Amazon.
B00ZWRGDFM|5|They work nicely in my RV.  I installed all 10 in places that I wanted a warm light versus a very white light.  Bedroom, bunks, couch and dining.  White in the bath and kitchen area.  They stay cool to the touch.  Nice in the hot summer months.  Zero failures as of today.  I'd buy them again.
B008JYXYNY|1|Did not like this item, as the seat beat won't retract when you release it without taking the LooPo off.  A clip works just as well and is easier to comer off.
B007TD1WIK|5|Bought it for our ATV's used to power a towable 12 volt boom sprayer. We were running batteries down and needed a light weight jumper and this really fit the need perfectly.
B000JV4XEO|5|Outstanding
B009FOG3TO|5|good
