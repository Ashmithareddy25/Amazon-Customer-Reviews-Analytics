B000YHG72E|5.0|First and Best Movie we watch for the Holiday Season kick off!  Will Ferrell is the funniest man ever! Love it!
B005J2UM9S|4.0|I think this movie doesn't get the credit it deserves, I found it really well done. Some would say the acting is bad, but I'd have to disagree...the actors did a great job at portraying their characters (who are doing a documentary about ghosts). This movie gave me a few laughs before all the bad stuff started happening, but after that I was watching through my fingers. Had some very creepy moments!<br /><br />It's definitely worth the $.99 I spent on it.
B004UZGWL2|4.0|A good read for the Tolkein fan, but only after reading at least the Silmarillon, if not also LOTR and the Hobbit as well.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|CD was awesome! It was only $4.99...totally worth the money. It is better than Rihanna's last album in my opinion.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|fantastic and quick read - I couldn't put it down.  I loved the incorporation of the flowers and the fact that the author spent all of that time developing her 'own' dictionary.  Really an enjoyable story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game wakes me up calling my name can wait to unlock the rest of the puzzle good good good times
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Way to Go John G. Just when I think you can't do it again, you do! I couldn't figure out just who was the crook, or racjeteer!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Awesome first CD from One Direction. Most of the songs are catchy. Some of the ballads a little iffy, but the fast up beat songs have me turn the music up and sing my lungs out.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I was disappointed in this book. I think it lacked the charm of the other books. I missed Rodrick and his pranks and Gregs parents ideas of fun. I have loved all of the other books in the series but I was majorly disappointed in this one. I don`t understand why we should be interested in Greg`s love. I think that overall- you should not purchase this book as it might be a waste of your money.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There are no words to describe just how good this book is!!!<br />I loved it as much as the first book!!!
B003WKOU0G|3.0|I found this movie to be very interesting. I must say that I really enjoyed watching it and later discussing it with friends.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This movie was exciting from beginning to end. This was a fun movie for all ages!! The picture is almost life-like.
0525958002|5.0|Maybe not as in depth as I would have liked, but very informative anyway.  Interesting to see what it was like for John Taylor and how he dealt with stardom.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I did not get the whole angry birds hype so I decided to try it and see what it was all about. Now I am totally hooked! lol
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great music for these guys. I first heard their initial music and thought they would be good and now I am convinced.
B005HSL626|1.0|Hard to play when it doesn't run right. It either freezes up or shuts down on its own in the middle of a game. My tablet is new so it's not my tablet being the problem.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Needed to have the first CD by these guys for my collection. Excellent music. These guys if they stay together can make some very good music with songs and lyrics.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Five stars.  Can't wait to read the sequels.  Kept my nose in the book for many hours at a time.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|Ordered for christmas gift. not sure how well it will work unil it is given. the only down fall i see with it so far is, it is much smaller than i thought it would be. picture makes it seems larger.
B009YU62H2|4.0|This cd jams all the way through, cornells primal screams , thayils killer riffs, cameron and shepard rocking out, this was a long time coming and they did it right.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I think this movie got some poor reviews when it came out.  Luckily they dont matter to me.  I have been watching this for two or three years.  Its got a lot of heart,  the obvious reference to the cast of Star Trek makes it funnier,  but its funny anyway.  The music is also sweet,  the choir that sings when great things are suddenly realized,  the flight through space,  the death of a friend.  While the lizard bad guy is hokey,  badly so,  i guess the original star trek bad guys were hokey.  But this is the only<br />place where it doesnt really work,  neither the voice nor the make up of the bad guy is right and we are taken out of the fantasy of the naive visitors from far away worlds who believe in tv shows as if they are real,  and create a whole possible world from every detail of the episodes of Galaxy Quest.  Tim and Rick are good,  but Signorney is really funny,  and as usual Sam Rockwell makes the film.  'Did you guys even Watch the show?&#34; he pleads... and you can tell he has watched everything about the show,  his character within a character honed in quite perfectly.  its fun,  watch it.  i think you'll enjoy it.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is a great collection! You can definitely hear some of the differences in listening to the tunes in the format of which they were recorded. And it's interesting to listen to the stereo version and mono version back-to-back. the mono sounds so much fuller (depending on your sound source).
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|So I really, really enjoyed this movie,since it had an engaging plot,simplistic yes,but good enough for me and it was a joy to see all the older action hero's together kicking ass on people that need their clocks cleaned! In this case old Claude Van Damme! He makes a decent bad guy and his acting chops have improved with age. I particularly enjoyed Chuck N orris's take with the Spaghetti Western music in the background and him striding out of the smoke after wiping out all the bad guys single handed...he he! It was done so good ,that I am ready for a third movie to complete the collection,only I am not sure who they're going to get for it. No matter what, this movie was worth the bucks to see and to own!
B0055B7K7A|5.0|The old man reminds me so much of my grouchy grandpa, and the dog reminds me of my own doofus yellow pup. It's such feel-good, funny movie, and great for the whole family.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|We wanted to update the picture quality for this yearly classic, and we were not dissapointed: picture quality was as expected from a bluray format.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Maybe \\"The Iron Lady\\" is a great film.  But I couldn't tell you.  Because after about twenty minutes of watching it, I had to bail.<br />  If a more depressing film got made that year, I don't know which it was.  But \\"The Iron Lady?\\"  What were they thinking when they made this?<br />  Spoiler Alert!!!  The first quarter or so of the film is mainly Mrs. Thatcher shown in serious decline -- just hours away, it seemed, from complete absorption in senile dementia.  And the only relief provided from that -- for the audience, that is --was by brief flashbacks of what she was sketchily able to remember about her past.<br />  Now, like her or not, one has to admit that Mrs Thatcher lived an interesting life.  Certainly one that was worth a biography or two.  Given that, though, why one that focuses so on a tragic closing episode?<br />  Like I said, however, I didn't watch \\"The Iron Lady\\" in its entirety.  Couldn't.  Got so depressed I had run to my therapist's office and try to get an emergency appointment.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Excellent season!  The plot continues to thicken. Highly recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and sci if series.
B0013O123Q|1.0|This film sucked from the 1st credits, the spinning camera was just stupid, do NOT waste your time. Wish I could give it a minus 5.
B008GANNIC|4.0|Good album I like their style of rock hip hop. Higher is the best track on this album. It's good
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My grandson loves this puzzle, even though he is very young for it. He loves to touch the screen and try to get the pieces to move! I would recommend this puzzle to others!
B0090CMMIC|4.0|This is an excellent band & album I really like their music even though they are from the U.K. :)
1451696191|5.0|This book. Just. Wow. It changed some of my views on life. I just paged through this wildly. The angst that is felt by Charlie is so sad and it is really impossible to not relate to this wonderful boy. I just recommend this to anyone who has ever felt self-conscious or slightly awkward in his/her life. Great book.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I have always been a fan of this classic, but even more so now that I have been exposed to the audio version and this wonderful cast of characters.  I just loved it!
0525478817|3.0|I felt like throughout this book a point was attempting to be proven, but it didn't quite get there. I absolutely loved the sampler I read on my Kindle, but everything after that was simply, alright. I thought the love story was sweet, but I felt more pity for each character than anything else. Maybe there was a greater meaning that I failed to see, but regardless it wasn't what I expected after the sampler. Also, the ending? What is up with that? Gus writes his letter, and we don't even really hear what Hazel thinks of it. We get two lines of her thoughts, but that's it. Are we to assume we know her well enough to guess what she would have felt after reading it? Either way, I didn't feel like the story really got the ending it deserved.
B00371QQ2U|4.0|excellent movie, watched if when it first came out, I could never tire of it.  A great part of history
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I wanted to rewatch this movie before seeing the new one and the convenience of renting it on amazon fit my needs perfectly.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I purchased this for my husband and got a really good deal on a refurbished unit.  Unfortunately when he tried it for the first time after giving it a full charge, it did not work.  The rotating bezel froze so you could not access any of the menu items.  The company through Amazon had great customer service and was willing to fix and send it back, or send a replacement.  We opted for the refund.  The hubby didn't want to chance a broken bezel again.  I think it was a little too advanced for his taste.  He went back to the original Forerunner 101.  Works great!
B007BLEKPM|3.0|Not a great effort by Clint, and Dicaprio could only do so much with it. Worth a watch if you are bored and like Dicaprio when he's not doing violence.
0007374798|5.0|The best cake's book! Very happy with my choice, the gratest cakes ever, and very simple recipies to do it yourself!
B003RT0NK8|4.0|Amazing director taking his hand at sci fi. As with nearly all science fiction movies, it doesn't live up to the imagination presented in the opening.  It deteriorates into a quasi-horror movie, abandoning the sci fi premise for a standard ending. If you saw Slumdog Millionaire, watch 127 Hours (just eat and hydrate first). If you want brilliant sci fi, watch 2001, Never Let Me Go, Blindness, Blade Runner (Director's Cut), 12 Monkeys, The Fountain....
B00881PPTO|5.0|5 star app better then the free app why not upgrade and no adds win win you can't lose same permissions as a free version I don't understand the negative reviews
B007SSEU9O|3.0|Amazon says I watched it, but I barely remember it. Not the best movie, there are a vast many others where Streep is worth watching.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Nothing says Christmas quite like the Grizwalds.  I laugh every time I watch this one...from finding the right tree to getting the perfect gift (meow) to the Christmas Catfood jello...
B0085A9J18|5.0|There are some giving this movie low reviews on the basis of plot, and story line.  While the story is not top notch, it does create a good basis for the desperate, and very gritty fight scenes, and my review is based mostly on the action.  The fight scenes in this movie are so intense I actually had serious doubts about whether or not I should ever watch it again; thinking it might actually ruin my enjoyment of other action films.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Sad commentary of our times, but well written and thought provoking. So many people relate to this as it seems we are quickly moving in the direction of this book... the have's and the have not's.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|A pop operetta with the ABBA songs, with a nice views shooted in Greece, and others very theatrical in England, Academy Award Winners Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, Colin Firth, gave to the screen good performances, with the young revelation Amanda Seyfried (acts, sings & dances), also starring Pierce Brosnan and Stellan Skarsgård and Christine Baransky, cameo by Benny Anderson ABBA´s composer. DTS in all languages.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love this as much as the first season, can't wait to see where the story goes next. Fantastic acting and story line.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Based upon the boon written by Dr. Carl Sagan, an interesting posibility to travel throug time-space, directed by Academy Award Winner director Robert Zemeckis
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Not really easy to navigate.  You can't take a picture of something in front of you, only what is looking at the screen, which doesn't make much sense to me.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a dedicated N.D.M. reader, so, I liked the book-but had a little bit of a hard time with the powers that be sending off the likes of John Corey to pick off the jihadist. I think the whole country would be on Xanax if we knew even a little bit of what has been stopped from happening here. This  book is a definite &#34;Thank you&#34; to all who work behind the scenes to keep us safe. Gotta say-J.Corey does keep me laughing. Can't wait for the next book.
B007R21JJK|5.0|Just as the title says, Gigabyte has produced yet another great motherboard. I have had zero (yes zero) problems with this board. The 3d bios is kinda funky, as I am used to plain text, but it gives people more of an opportunity to overclock. The EZ tune software also produces great results with little to no effort. Make sure you are watching your temperatures if you do decide to overclock. You don't want to ruin your system just because the ease is provided for you.<br /><br />Plugged into the motherboard is an i7, coolermaster hyper 212 cooler, 7970, 16 gb HyperX ram and numerous case fans. Again, I would recommend this motherboard in a heard beat. It has served me well, and will continue to do so.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|So my sister asked me to watch this series because her and my mom do.  I started to watch it on Netflix and have to say I have been sucked in.  So for Christmas I have asked for both season one and two.<br /><br />Would recommend this show to my friends!!
B004FA8NOQ|5.0|Intel makes fantastic chips. I think we all know that. The i7 2600K is another wonderful creation. I have the intel overclocked to 4.5 ghz with no problems. I use aftermarket cooling ([[ASIN:B005O65JXI Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan (RR-212E-20PK-R2)]]) and the chip just goes to town. I render through most nights and the chip has held up it's end of the bargin.<br /><br />I don't believe that I will be needing another card anytime soon. The price to performance is great for me. I am also a gamer and this chip handles anything I have thrown at it. Great product. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0087DFIOU|5.0|This is a awesome movie. this is one of the best mel gibson movies i've seen in years. this is a really good movie even though half of it was in spanish i enjoyed it very much. well what do you expect out of mel gibson a bad movie. i think he is the only reason why people liked this movie it would not suprise me. all in all it was a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I hate that you cant look back further then a few hours...it blocks you and mno matter how much you reload it keeps locking up and wont let you go back.  Already took the app off my Kindle Fire and I just keep a web window open...so much better that way!
B000AP04L0|5.0|Who can't love this movie? Absolutely fantastic! I strongly recommend to anyone who is stuck in the 9-5 purgatory of oblivious, inconsiderate upper-ups and coworkers.
B008VBYN80|5.0|fun game. I would recommend it. the only downside is the energy bar, it gets used up too quickly. still a great game though, developed well.
1881273156|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic in better understanding your various relationships (familial, parental, friendship, work), though it was written to focus mainly on romantic, which it does an incredible job of addressing. I strongly recommend this book to everyone and have lost track of how many copies I've either loaned out or just given away!
B004XQO90O|5.0|A friend of mine rented this for us to watch one night.  She didn't like it because it made her have to pay attention and think.  I loved it because it made me have to pay attention and think!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Just found it a bit too erotica for my taste.  Of course, it's likely that there was so much hype about it, that I was just a bit disappointed. Kind of like the usual let down of a hit movie that has been over publicized and talked about.  I think there are a lot of mixed reviews on this.  Either way, I won't continue the trilogy.
B001BR5NH6|5.0|This is a classic.  I bought this and a few others for when my kids are in their teens.  If they don't like them, they can move out.
1419705849|4.0|This book was pretty good. Since half of the book is pictures, it is a quick read but the pictures help you visualize the book. It is funny like the rest of the books.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt!!  This movie is a classic!!  Even though I could get it free from our local library, I had to have my own copy.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Actually, the routine that I go through each time I order a new D.V.D. ,or collection of same, is as follows.  I start by watching the<br />feature in advance to determine if it is going to be &#34;good&#34; enough to own.  Then, I go to &#34;my Amazon&#34; and order the item in question.  Due to time issues, which could be somewhere in the near to not-so-near future, I don't actually view the Item(s).  So, about the only things I may be qualified to rate would be...time it takes for delivery, and appearance upon arrival.  I'm rarily, if ever disappointed due to Amazon's super ability of doing what it does.  So, the good news is kinda' the bad news...sorry, and KEEP-UP up the great job doing what you do better that any one else on the Internet.  Thanks, Fred Howard
B0098460O4|4.0|I was expecting a little more in the sound production and mixing, but still a great disc, these two kids are unbelievable, just as Simon said on the show...
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I thought this book was very funny and sad at the same time.<br />Was a bit dissapionted in the ending, it seemed rushed.
B00A861QMM|1.0|I was looking forward to playing this but it not work on kf the hint button would not even work. even if it free<br />its a rip off
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|musical genius. Beyond blown away. Just buy this already, you absolutely will not regret it. I listen to this ALL the time
086571701X|5.0|I got this for my husband, &#34;Great Book&#34; his words. He has set about in the gatherer of items for Aquaponic gardening, given some time I'm sure I'll be seeing fish in my greenhouse
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I like  Henning Mankell much more than other´s  thriller´s writters, because besides  in  his books there are Psycollogical<br />studies of the caracteres.<br />I enjoyed every book of him : you will find there :  emotion, and all the action of this kind of novels.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|a masterfully woven story (even though there are some plot holes and continuinity issues) Director scott has crafted together a very good prequel to the Alien franchise
B000HL09MG|4.0|As with every Stanley Kubrick Film I've ever seen, this movie pretty much blows me away! From all of the sexual tension between the two main characters, expertly played by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, to the unusual awkwardly silent moments (Kubrick was a master of the pregnant pause in movies) this movie never lets up even though it moves at a slow pace. Cruise's character's venture into the unusual gathering of the weird and very intimidating secret society (conspiracy theorists eat your heart out) was worth the movie alone, but also such strange and interesting characters like Sidney Pollack's among the many, this movie leaves you with a warm feeling inside after watching it. I know this movie has been panned by many critics, but if you give it a chance and watch it a couple of times, you'll see that this is one of Kubrick's best directing efforts in his already amazing career; too bad it was his last.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for a friend who, like me is besotted with Nathan Fillion and loves the Caskett team!
B00A4W3AJC|5.0|It's not that most people have many expectations when seeing this movie.  I was unfamiliar with the Writer/Director Leos Carax, most of the lead actors and the trailer left me puzzled.  It's the ability of the movie to continually surprise, confuse and alternately either amuse or frustrate you that is its greatest delight.  There is a narrative throughout the film that involves Monsieur Oscar (Denis Levant) being chauffeured in a tacky limousine by a middle-aged, classically French beauty (Edith Scob).  He goes from \\"job\\" to \\"job\\" during the course of one day and becomes different characters, presented in a series of vignettes that are very different, mostly stand-alone stories filmed in different styles and moods.  Don't expect to learn much more about Monsieur Oscar.  You don't even know if he is really alive or dead and end the end it doesn't matter.  He's just a vehicle (metaphor?) to tell the different stories.  Some you will like more than others.  My friends I spoke to about this film didn't agree on which ones they liked.  They cover a pretty vast range of emotions in the human experience.  It's whatever strikes a chord with you.  The stories themselves can be enjoyed at face value but there is plenty of symbolism to give those who enjoy interpreting such things fodder for many a dinner party.  I haven't read any official reviews of this film but I did see a quote from Leos Carax that the film is (paraphrasing) \\"not about the cinema... who would go see a movie about that\\"?  Well, for me that's confirmation that on one level that the film is indeed about cinema itself and how audiences expectations have changed.  In this sense, this is a movie for movie buffs which is probably why it has won so many awards.  That's just one of many themes running through it.  There are others that you may perceive... or not.  I loved this film while watching it and thinking about it for days later, which is not something I normally do.  If you can let go of the classic Hollywood storytelling model, you may be surprised how much you like this movie too.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|In spite of the fact that even actors from the film had no idea what it was about, this is a great piece of work by David Lynch. Very open to interpretation on a number of levels-some of which we'll never attain.
1451627289|5.0|This book got my attention in the first chapter. A very interesting read. I like it that it is not full of swearing.

B009VB7P6G|5.0|This is such a nice movie, I saw it with the grandkids and loved it! The movie itself is so very pretty great eye candy, good story line, great movie for the family.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I don't care what people are saying about the episodes being cut or missing features from the DVD's. These are the broadcast episodes from the original airings. I love this set so much! I'm actually watching it as I type this! Great for any F•R•I•E•N•D•S fan!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy but challenging puzzle, great for killing time while waiting. Some levels are quite challenging to do on a phone screen but still a great game.
0525953728|5.0|This is an excellent well written book for someone interested in government and history.  I was surprised, but very glad I took the time to read it.
B006ZJJ6XW|4.0|My only quibble with other reviews would be that the Eroica isn't nearly the letdown they claim. Overall the less popular symphonies 2, 4, 8 get excellent treatments with vigor  and a sense of humor. His version of Symphony 9 is one of my top five favorites.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|An excellent read. The reader should be careful to be aware that the results achieved were by a professional person who had the knowledge and determination to do what was required. The average person will profit from the book but should not expect to achieve identical recovery.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Great book if you are into historical war subject matter. This book is written from a soldier's point of view and is quite graphic in the battle coverage, and not for the faint of heart.
B000067IZ3|5.0|Traffic was superlative in all its aspects - writing, directing, acting, etc. It supplied no answer to the drug problem becuse frankly there is none in the present age. The \\"war against drugs\\" cannot & will not be \\"won\\" anymore than the war on poverty can be \\"won.\\" But GOOD does not give up in its struggle against EVIL, & finds its only hope ultimately in God's kingdom reigning through Jesus Christ on earth - which the Bible promises one day will come to pass.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is stunning.  The story, the acting, the effects, the craftsmanship of the filmmakers--everything hits on all cylinders.  And with the extra features available with THE CRITERION COLLECTION, the viewer learns about the remarkable technology that allowed Brad Pitt to play young (meaning \\"old\\") Benjamin by digitally placing an animated face on another actor's body.  Then the viewer learns how \\"cosmetic\\" effects were used to make Pitt and costar Cate Blanchett look much, much younger. The disc containing the special features, where everything is discussed about the film--from its inception to post-production--is actually longer than the film itself, but well worth taking the time to watch.  It's as spellbinding as the haunting tale of Benjamin Button--a person who was born old, and ages backwards through decade after decade of life primarily in New Orleans.  And over the course of the story, some very compelling and interesting characters weave in and out of Benjamin's life in grand fashion.<br /><br />And what a story!  As director David Fincher advises in a must-see audio commentary, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is not a \\"love story\\", it's a \\"death story.\\"  As the story begins, we find Cate Blanchett's Daisy character literally on her death bed as Katrina bears down on NOLA.  As she has her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) read aloud from Benjamin's personal diary, the story moves back to New Orleans during World War I, to the dedication of a new clock for the city's train station, whereby Gateau, the blind clockmaker, has installed a clock that runs backwards--\\"So that all the sons we lost in the war might return to us.\\"  We then move to the evening of Armistice Day, the night a withered and monster-looking Benjamin is born, with his dazed father (Jason Flemying) literally leaving the newborn on the doorstep of the local old folks' home.  Thus an ancient-looking Benjamin literally grows up surrounded by death, as inhabitant after inhabitant dies, only to be replaced by other inhabitants who die.  Benjamin's childhood may be the best, most entertaining part of a most entertaining film, because all the characters that come into Benjamin's life are so delightful and fun to watch.  (Two of the most compelling characters are Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), Benjamin's adoptive mother, and the hysterical Captain Mike (Jared Harris), who gives adolescent Benjamin his first job on a tugboat, and a most interesting coming-of-age evening.)  Of course it's during his childhood that Benjamin meets 7-year-old Daisy; both are immediately drawn to one another, and as Daisy so wondrously states, they spend the next few years preparing to \\"meet in the middle.\\"<br /><br />The story moves on from Benjamin's childhood, when he leaves New Orleans at age 17 (yet he looks 60) to adventure on Captain Mike's boat literally all over the world.  Before World War II erupts, he has his first love affair in Russia with Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton is terrific), the wife of an English diplomat, and during the war Benjamin experiences suffering and death as Captain Mike's tugboat is destroyed at sea.  Benjamin returns to New Orleans following the war, and as the years unfold his youthful looks begin to coincide with Daisy's (who is in a ballerina troupe traveling the world), until an injury ends her career, and in her thirties she returns to New Orleans, and Benjamin and Daisy begin their lives together.  There is pending heartbreak because, as Benjamin laments, \\"Nothing ever lasts\\", and over the decade of the Sixties Daisy ages while Benjamin looks younger; a daughter is born in 1968, and a year later, Benjamin informs his soulmate, \\"She needs a father, not a playmate.\\"  He quietly leaves early one dawn, and we don't find him again until 13 years later, when he shows up unexpectedly at Daisy's dance studio; both Benjamin and Daisy are in their fifties, yet Daisy looks middle-aged, while Benjamin barely looks 20.

1451620829|1.0|This book doesn't reveal anything that most KISS fans don't already know or haven't already read. Unfortuneately the one thing that does shine through is his lack of education and class. While he does admit to making many mistakes on his own, he always seems to be able to place the blame for the mistake on someone else. Sort of like \\"he did this, so I did this\\" kind of thing.<br /><br />Peter just comes across as vindictive and angry that he got the short end of the stick on every side when it was clearly his choice to cloud his mind and waste his talent with all the drugs he did. As a musician myself I wouldn't be too kind in dealing with a member with explosive mood swings and chemical dependancy issues.<br /><br />Out of all the KISS related \\"tell-alls\\" I've read, this one is at the bottom.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first two books are much better, but the conclusion to the story lies in this book. Read this to get the end of the story only.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|it was a good movie and it was worth wathcing with a very good twist .i would tell people to check it out
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If you can get through the first book I recommend reading the second and third book because that is where the story lies. Although I didn't really care for this book, I did enjoy the second two books.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I wasn't thrilled about Fifty Shades of Grey. It took me a long time to buy the second book. I am glad I purchased the second and third book because the story line really starts in the second book. I enjoyed the last two books so much that I began to read the Trilogy again immediately after I finished.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I love this series, dont go into watching this expecting what you saw as a child or thinking its going to be as great to watch as show today, but it is entertaining to watch knowing this
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Hard to follow with the dialect<br />Saw the movie and. Found it a total mess.  Thought I would try the book but its not helping.
B001ONKTVM|5.0|Amazing live album! WAY BETTER then live in anaheim and again, worth the $ halfords voice is TOP shape here, dont miss it

B005FISC52|5.0|Got the last season of OTH. I'm still in the seventh season but this one came on time and in its original packing :)
B005LJETYI|3.0|Kind of short but its a good story, not excellent though ,... not a \\"they live happily ever after\\" ending in the case you're looking for that kind of story.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Got this fourth season on time and in its original packaging as I had anticipated. I'm watching season 7 right now!
B007L6VR12|4.0|What a strange movie. Not bad, how could it be with all these great actors?! It was deffinitely different though.

B000JZ3TYA|5.0|Michael Douglas does a great job in this film. Brilliant acting and brilliant storyline, making this movie a classic for me.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Got it for my wife and she loves it. She uses decorative paper between the clear case and phone and is able to change the look of her case whenever she wants. Good product.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Great movie, I love most of Johnny Depps films, but this was different for him. He played the part well, as usual. and although I am not one for vampires, this movie was done well.
B0020M99LC|3.0|Movie was too long, they coulc have cut part of it.  Also sometimes hard to follow and hard to hear or understand what is being said.
B005SH5K7I|3.0|good movie, not as funny as it could have been. The draw was the leading man, he is funny in almost everything that he does.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Great! Loved the quality and quick way to buy the product. Fast and very effecient would buy again in the future
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Cute movie, but moved a little slow. We did watch the entire thing, even tho we realized right away it wasn't our kind of venue.
B009SQOGZ2|3.0|I like animated movie. I enjoy the art work and craftsmanship that goes into making these kinds of film. This one fell a  little below the level of great. Norman's looks could have been made more sympathetic. Story line was predictable. At the end of the film the  screaming blasts made by the little girl witch was to provide 'shock and awe' but after a while I was saying enough already. The conclusion dragged on too much for me....
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is an excellent book for elementary school children, but with deeper meanings understood by teenagers and adults. It's probably my favorite book!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|There is not exta narration through out which I LOVE! It gives you extras in the front of the book with a lil history, but they left the story untouched which is great. There is just enough illustration to give you a start, but otherwise it leaves the rest to your imagination
0312576463|1.0|This book is the worst book I have ever read. I can't decide if I am more pissed at how bad the book is or more pissed at myself for continuing to plow through this precious tedious monstrosity. Honestly, after the first 300 pages, I should have realized that it was never going to be ABOUT ANYTHING-but no, stupid me plowed through another 300 pages!!! Who writes 600 pages of navel-gazing nothingness!! Worse, who reads it?  Teenage diary entries are more enlightened then this tedious crap. Save your money. Don't buy this book. Save precious hours of your life. Don't even borrow it from the library!!
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I've watched every Robin Hood movie ever made and this is by far the best story line of how the legend came to be.  Russell Crowe is convincing and the cinematography is excellent.  I wish there was a sequel.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Makes for quick access to many documents from almost any location.  I used the commercial product while at work.  Having access to the Adobe Reader at home is a privilege.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|Very much not what I was hoping for.  Uninspired corporate pop rock and not a return to the 70's sound.  This truly is a paint by the numbers CD.<br /><br />I was really hoping we would go 3 for 3 with the amazing albums put out by Van Halen (A Different Kind of Truth) and Rush (Clockwork Angels) this past year, but I guess 2 for 3 ain't bad...  Hopefully, Aerosmith aren't done yet because they still have a great \\"sound\\", it's just that the musical direction and songs here are poor.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I had rented this movie a long time ago, and couldn't wait to own it. It is sooooo funny, I laughed till I thought I broke a rib.
B009CG2YDE|3.0|Velocipider is a clever and enjoyable space invader clone. Its a fun and simple game that really deserves a higher rating then I can gave it. However its lack landscape mode and under sensitive tilt only controls make it difficult to play on larger tablets like my arcos 10.1 turbo. If you are using a smaller phone or a very light tablet you may value the more highly then I do.  between tablet weight, and the amount of motion to get your ship to slide about  in a predicable fashion, I cant really rate this well on my tablet. On my weaker phone (a zte z990 aka att avail) the game is prone to sudden but brief freezes follow by skipped frames and sudden death. So I cant suggest the game to owners of inexpensive or low powered phones. Its pity since I really want to like the game.
B00003Q438|5.0|I loved this movie from the time I first saw it. I never get tired of the drama and the suspense. What a great pic.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|Very fun game - requires some thinking but over all it is fun to play.  I would definitely recommend it
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Joe Wright has done a wonderful job creating these vivid characters in the big screen from the book Pride and Prejudice. Every element of the story was conveyed in an artistic way with foremost respect to the integrity of the original piece. The eloquent portrayal of the story of Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy was complemented with an excellent soundtrack, which served as the motif throughout the entire picture. Joe Wright perspicacious vision of this film has propagated a work of art that culminates this romantic love story in the most inspiring manner.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|I was shocked how bad this was. I mean really bad. Do not waste your time. You can guess what happens from the trailer, so save yourself about 2 hours!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like playing this game!  I wish the transitions from one player to another were quicker.  The other drawback for me is that I have a hard time drawing with my finger.<br /><br />But I have a lot of fun playing!
B004SBULWE|4.0|I like this app. Not exactly sure what its supposed to do,  a friend told me to download it.  I think it does what it is supposed to do.  I have not had any issues with my phone since adding this app. It come on when I power down my phone I hit kill app and then it goes off the message bar.  I would give it give stars of I knew exactly what it should be doing.
0425263916|4.0|I love the second book and I think so far so good, but cannot  wait to read the third one. I wish I did not have to wait until May.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you on edge and leaves you wanting more!!! Read the books twice ce now and can't find anything good to read since.
0425263908|4.0|Different but nice love story. It differ from most book, but took me back to my favorite reading fifty shades.
B004LROUNG|3.0|A fast read, but really no depth of character.  Still, it was fun for a lightweight legalese drama but I look forward to a little more Grisham magic the next time. Actually, this book read as if it were written by someone else other than Grisham as it lacked his style and his expertise and simply had little but a clean plot to recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|love to smash those pigs , and my 4 year old great niece loves it  she loves to smash those green pigs too
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a book filled with about every emotion I've experienced reading- sadness, fear, suspense, distrust, confusion, anger,curiosity and wonder. I don't know that I could say it had a happy ending to be truthful. Pi's encounter with the Japanese investigators was a startling confusion.  And it left me with doubts and lack of a sense of true reality. The journey Pi made was exciting and scary and, yet, showed his confidence even when he didn't believe it. I don't want to say more because much more detail will spoil your experience of reading the book. Just be sure to read the book before seeing the movie- I always find that is the best way to experience the full story.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I'v use it for about 150 hours and it starts to show it's real sound. It has a great difference from the time I bought it. You should have one. BTW, you need a quiet environment otherwise others might be bothered or you might be bothered. (It depends on the loudness of others :) )
B001993Y3G|5.0|es exactamente lo que estaba esperando estoy muy satifecho con el producto me encanta y el precio esta perfecto gracias
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I love this album- it's got great songs, done wonderfully well.<br /><br />Her version of \\"River\\"- the Joni Mitchell song- is gorgeous.
B007R41E8O|4.0|The graphics are great and the story is interesting. The hidden object part was fun. My only complaint is I didn't like the ending. I won't spoil it for the people who want to try it, but it was stupid in my opinion. No offense to the people who liked it. Overall the game is fun, but a different ending would've made it better.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Seriously, I loved Season 5. After reading a lot of negative reviews, I wasn't sure I would like it at all; but I can now say it's my favorite season since the very first.<br /><br />This is a good DVD set, with the usual (for Mad Men) complement of interesting features and commentary tracks, along with decent packaging, video quality, and sound. (I used to take such things for granted, but I've been disappointed often enough with other disks that I now feel that I should point these things out when they're done right.)<br /><br />I do have two small nitpicks about the DVDs:<br /><br />1. Some of the Special Features on the disks contain spoilers for episodes that are on later disks. That is, if you watch the Special Features on Disk 2 (for example) before watching the episodes on Disks 3 and 4, you will see things that you might not want to know about yet. I recommend that you watch the entire season's episodes first, and then go back and watch the Special Features.<br /><br />2. I'm not completely dependent on closed captions, but I do keep them on and I sometimes find them very helpful. However, I found a lot of errors in the captions on these disks. Most are minor, and only mildly confusing (example: \\"AMP\\" instead of \\"A&P\\"); but if you can't hear at all, you may find the errors annoying and frustrating.
0547884591|5.0|I havent had a chance to get into the meat of this book yet but in the 5 minutes that I have spent with it was all I needed for an initial review. First of all the book is beautifully designed. I like that the theme is consistant with the 4 hour body. Side note: I really like the glossy cover however I remove it when reading the book (better user experience). I actually like the down to earth context in the book. I believe it gives the reader a much better ability to relate a grasp the concepts. I like that its a pick your poison type book and not meant to read cover to cover. I look forward to experimenting with this book!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It works perfectly! Helps me know how I can save battery life and alerts me when the battery gets low. One of the things I like about it the most is it tells me the health of my battery!
0547884591|5.0|Still reading it and WOW! I can't wait to start making changes. Yesterday, a few family members and I went through the book, reading passages, and discussing Tim's approach; expect a few more purchases, Tim!. Reading The 4-Hour Chef books has now become a group project. I am giving my extra copy (thanks, CreativeLive!!) to my 11 year old niece. :-)
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Fast moving police story with the added confusion of trying to separate the TV series from the novel &#34;written&#34; by Richard Castle.  The same with all the Nikki Heat books.  I read them one after the other and had a very hard time putting them down.  Can't wait for the next one.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I know this movie will not be everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoyed it. Kind of a mix between reading Killing Lincoln and watching the Matrix at the same time. Great movie for the action movie lovers who like history.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie is adorable, and clearly illustrates the meaning of the phrase &#34;man's best friend&#34;. It is a little bit sad, but I think it is well worth watching. I was amazed when I found out it was based on a true story.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Wes Anderson movies always hit it out of the park. This movie takes us all back in time to the first person we fell in love with.  Great performances by Bruce Willis, Fancis McDormat, Edward Norton, and Anderson stalwart Bill Murray. The kids are really the stars of the show and you will fall for them within the first 10 minutes. Great show!
B008YW5RH2|3.0|Not a bad app for passing the time, but some functions are only available with purchase. With that being the case, it shouldn't be considered a free app.
B009CPRYG2|5.0|Another great cartoon flick from the DC Universe Animation Team. The best part is the there's a second one coming out. You really get a feel for how badass Batman even in his later years. Any animation DC or Marvel junkie will love this movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My mom got this game for my boys on her ipad and it’s a pretty good game; fun when you need something to do. I downloaded it on my kindle and I find it just the same. Function is the same as the ipad and no problems with any lag/response time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so amazing &amp;&amp;'dd I love it but you have to like challenging things that you may not get right away besides that its real funk (:

B000C4A1EO|5.0|Yeah, this is not one of the Keeper CDs; but that does not mean it is a boo-awful mediocre CD.<br /><br />This CD is criminally ignored and under-rated.  Yeah, the band slowed down a little bit than the \\"Keeper\\" CDs,<br />but just b/c they slowed down a little on this CD, does not mean they sold out or it wasn't worth listening to<br />as so many negative reviews here on Amazon.com want you to believe.  Just b/c a band slows down a little bit<br />does not mean they still can't rock anymore.  There are 3 joke songs on this CD: \\"Heavy Metal Hamsters\\", \\"I'm Doing Fine Crazy Man\\", and the very short intro \\"Pink Bubbles Go Ape title song\\", but even those songs are still very good if you sit down and listen to them.<br /><br />There are outstanding songs on this CD that are just as good as anything on the \\"Keeper\\" CDs.  I mean, it is Michael Kiske singing on this CD! The man can sing a little kid's song or a Christmas song and it would sound amazing!  So, there is nothing wrong with the singing talent on this CD.<br /><br />I was surprised of how heavy \\"Kids of the Century\\" song was.  That song is just as heavy as any song on the 2 \\"Keeper\\" CDs.  Absolutely check out: \\"Kids of the Century\\", \\"Back on the Streets\\", \\"Number One\\", \\"Goin' Home\\", \\"Someone's Crying\\", \\"Mankind\\", and \\"The Chance\\".<br />The one and only song on this entire CD that I did not like was \\"Your Turn\\".  It just did not fit the feel of this CD.  Way too slow of a song.  I am surprised \\"Your Turn\\" wasn't on the next CD that came after this one called: \\"Chameleon\\". \\"Chameleon\\" CD was nothing like this CD at all, but that's another story for another time.<br /><br />If the \\"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\\" CD had came out from any other Power Metal band, even today it would be considered as a masterpiece of a CD, but b/c it comes out from Helloween; it is automatically ignored and overlooked.  Go figure?!<br /><br />This whole CD has Power Metal written all over it, and a lot of fun catchy songs too.  Even though it is a strange and weird CD cover to it, but underneath the cover is a great piece of Power Metal that you really can't go wrong with it. Definitely buy this CD, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />A dedicated Helloween fan.  \m/a strange and weird CD cover to it, but underneath the cover is a great piece of Power Metal that you really can't go wrong with it.

1559408855|3.0|Salo may not be the most impressive movie ever made, but it does deserve a degree of praise. Everyone knows that salo is notorious and not for the squeamish, so I won't waste anytime going into details. Once you can get past the grotesque subject matter, you can understand the allegorical context the director is intending to show. Salo as art is more powerful than it is as a movie, however it should still not be overlooked.

1594203334|4.0|Witty commentary and well researched facts with funny personal anecdotes of one American mom's experiences in the Parisian world of the 'bringing up bebe' . In my opinion, not all of the French ways with children can be agreed to (e.g. resistance to breastfeeding), but definitely many useful tips for avoiding sleepless nights, unruly restaurant behavior.  ...I also very much liked the their general rule of importance of social and  respectful manners.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|how can one explain getting to read this book?  I was very happy that the seller could get this to me so quickly so I too could see what everyone was talking about.
B006S08RLU|4.0|I was having a bit of a rough night...a bit lovelorn, kinda negative, etc etc.<br />Watching Amelie and how she turned mundane moments into magic and derived such pleasure from helping others really helped turn my mood around.<br /><br />Also, the cinematography is beautiful...just perfect for this type of script.<br /><br />I only wish the movie went a litttttle but further in having us get to know Amelie. She seemed almost otherworldly. Perhaps that is a part of the film's charm though.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|The movie has great special effects and some like the catchy lines especially by Ironman.  The plot is typical but the flick to me is too long.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|If you use a touch screen, whether on a tablet, a phone or a new Windows 8 computer, you need a stylus.  This is true even if you don't have especially large fingers.  Trying to hit the exact spot you want on a touch screen can be aggravating and time wasting if you miss.  You won't miss with this stylus.  There are three different size tips to customize your screen tapping experience.  The stylus itself is well designed with a clip to secure it and prevent it from rolling around.  It feels sturdy and comfortable in your hand.  The tips glide over the screen like butter.  And it cuts down or eliminates those ugly messy fingerprints that will cover your screen if you try to make do with fingers.  Especially recommended for games, but it also makes typing on those pop-up keyboards almost fun, instead of an exercise in frustration.

B008G12ERC|5.0|I really liked how the CD was shipped earlier than I expected! Not to mention that Muse is my favourite, and I couldn't wait for it to arrive! Thank you so much! I appreciate it!
B004ZNARH4|4.0|I picked up this and the Wish You Were Here Immersion Box Sets when they were Lightning Deals.  I am a fan of the Pink Floyd but in no way consider myself a rabid consumer of all things Floyd.<br /><br />The productions on these discs are well done and while I've not played every one, I'm happy with what I've got.  Indeed, when the rest of the family is out I sometimes enjoy putting this or WYWH on the stereo.<br /><br />Is this a MUST HAVE item? Hardly.  But if you know someone who appreciates all the bells and whistles this box includes, go right ahead.
B003L0V758|5.0|If you are tired of everything you hear on the radio and are looking for a wild, quirky, Broadway style romp through Oz, check out these beats.  Janelle Monáe is talented - no doubt! And this album is a strange flavor that grows on you.

B008K6HN8I|4.0|I copied a PDF file from an email to my Kindle.  I did this on purpose because I needed to read the 50-page PDF document for a class and reading it on a Kindle is way better than printing it and keeping up with the pages..  After I copied the file down, I didn't know how to locate it on my Kindle.  This app works kind of like MIcrosoft Windows Explorer.  It presents a list of files that you've copied to your Kindle.  I found all sorts of things that I didn't realize that I'd copied -- plus, I found my document.  I was the only student who did this, so, the other students thought I was playing with my Kindle in class :-).

B007UXT6T6|1.0|Just thought this was all-around terrible - action scenes were OK, but the story had a number of cheesy turns and a dismal plot. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind for it, but I am very glad that I didn't see this at the theater.

1452110581|5.0|My daughter first brought this collection to my attention and it had me laughing heartily in moments.  I will also say that, if you've never lived with cats, this won't be nearly as humorous as it would be if you have shared your spaces and time with felines.  It doesn't require reading in sequence; just pick up the book, open to a page, and enjoy!

0316228532|1.0|If I don't connect with a book within the first 50 pages, I usually abandon it. There are just too many books to be read without wasting time on one I don't like.  I stuck with this all the way through because of the author. Wish I'd quit after the first 50.<br /><br />I could not identify with any of the characters and didn't like any of them either. While many had some of my sympathy, one some my of my empathy, it was not enough for me to say I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />Any future books of Ms Rowlings, I'll look at the Amazon reviews before expending my time.

Discovering that \\"mysterious\\" pains in the neck were traumatic past-life events also explained the existence of many unaddressed underlining issues that indirectly rule our lives... Everybody should read it.

0547884591|5.0|I am a big Ferriss fan and a fitness nut, as well as a passionate cook, so I am excited about this new offering.<br /><br />I know it has been said that you should never trust a skinny cook, but I have to say - and no offense intended - that I would much rather look like Tim Ferriss than Ina Garten, his biggest competition!  If the general health and fitness of a cookbook author represent the effects of eating the foods presented, then this one is a hands-down winner.<br /><br />As a mother of 8 chidren, and host mom to 9 exchange students, I know a little about cooking and I love doing it. (I even have a son who is a professional chef!) However, with over 250 cookbooks on my kitchen shelf, I am VERY picky about adding new ones; this one I pre-ordered the minute it was available and am delighted to have it!<br /><br />As I have gotten - GULP - older, I have found that I can no longer eat the way I have most of my life, which really stinks.  I was getting bored with 'healthy' recipes that were simply not very fun or interesting, and after our youngest daughter left for college a few months ago, cooking for only two of us was almost too much trouble to do at all.  (People used to think I was kidding when they asked me how I cooked for a family of 10, which for years included 4 teenaged boys over 6' tall, and I answered that I quintupled every recipe and cooked in canning pots, but it was true...) So there I was, burned out on healthy cooking, and unable to eat carry out pizza without the strange side effect of having my laundry shrink; think about it...<br /><br />When I read Tim's first book, The 4-Hour Work Week, several years ago, I started opening my mind and creativity to how I could spend more time away from my very demanding brick and mortar business and have come up with some exciting ideas to that end.  I am looking forward to the same 'aha' moments about falling in love with cooking again!<br /><br />So many people now have grown up on diets of fast food that they know very little about how to nourish themselves in healthy, delicious, creative ways. Real cooking is considered to be either drudgery, or something best left to the few remaining June Cleavers of the world. Learning how to embrace fun and dynamic cooking skills, which have previously been the domain of professional chefs, is a real adventure that can now be embarked on by anyone - and who better to be the guide than Tim Ferriss!<br /><br />I am reading the book now and love the fact that Tim has tied learning how to cook into a framework of how to learn any desired skill - we need more people in the world who are empowered to actually do the things they dream of. The knowledge of how to learn, grow, and eat well while doing it, is probably the tastiest recipe of all!<br /><br />Keep it up, Tim!  I am currently writing a book about surviving the million dollar embezzlement of my company, and your instructions about how to write are just as valuable to me as being re-energized into creating a delicious meal after a hard day of running a big business, combined with intense writing! You are a powerful example of embracing life, taking intelligent risks, turning a potential negative - being banned from bookstores - into a positive, and clearly having a blast while doing it!<br /><br />(FYI, I am a master of one-day shopping, cooking and freezing meals that will feed a family for several weeks.  I am going to try it with some of your recipes and will let you know how it goes.  Maybe your next book can be The 4-Hour Chef In the Freezer!)

B0076UXKDG|3.0|Way too pricey for what it does, but the only alternative at the moment is a Chinese product.  I couldn't take a chance on frying a $3000 camera to save a couple hundred bucks.  Of course, it works perfectly, as you would expect.
0711225176|5.0|This is a great biography of Mucha. Condensed and easy to read. Contains beautiful images and is worth the price.
B008COD5OO|5.0|Great movie! I found it funny and outrageous! Somewhat like a kick off from The Hangover for a younger generation, but with actual partying and great music!
B008602KQI|5.0|Such a great movie, follows true to the book! :) Recommend it to everyone! Also read the book too you will certainly enjoy both!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Anyone who has ever been afraid of speaking in public or standing up in front of a crowd should see this movie.  The humor, the conflicts (both internal and external), and the courage displayed by &#34;Bertie&#34; are entertaining and inspiring. The acting is excellent. I use this film in my graduate communications class.  Bravo!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|well, at least 4-5 times a year, if the current record holds.<br /><br />if you haven't seen Thor, of all the backstories aside from iron man, that is a must-see.<br /><br />i love the avengers more every time i see it.  having it in 3D only increases watchability.  I have noticed that in 3D - including 2d to 3d conversion, as i commonly do with my favorite tv shows - i pick up on details (particularly expressions) that i missed even after multiple viewings.  well worth the investment in TV and player.<br /><br />now: what i can't wait for is...<br />1) hawk and black widow backstory.  when will this be made film?  i'm hooked on black widow.  please, marvel and paramount, give us some more; i'd love the story where these two met.  i know black widow has a long and convoluted marvel history, but that's the point where their stories seem to most intersect with the film version of the Avengers.<br />2) the best hulk to date.  i want more!<br />3) iron man 3!!!!<br /><br />and i wouldn't miss another Thor, either.  mmmmmm mmmmm mmmmmm.  Maybe they can show us what happens when Thor gets Loki back to Asgard...
0307594165|3.0|I can't say I loved this book. The characters are reasonably developed, but in the end I am filled with gaps in my understanding of the persons... open spaces. I see maturity in the hero, and there is roundness among other characters. Still, there are unresolved issues that I can't say I enjoyed leaving open.<br /><br />I appreciate Ms. Morrison writing a text so true to life, but I'm disappointed that I didn't feel the relief I normally feel when I close the cover of a Morrison novel.<br /><br />As such, I applaud the brilliant realism of Home, but I wish there was more to be said about the hero and those connected to him.
0439023548|4.0|I loved the first two books in this fantastic series. They are the kind of books that you can't put down. This third book was pretty dark and way too political for me to enjoy as much as the others. Still the great characters.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book kept my interest and the ending was not predictable. That was the best part. I have recommended the book to five of my friends and I don't think I have recommended a book to anyone in the past five years.

B0001N9ZKW|5.0|Nothing I can say about this recording hasn't been said by thousands of critics or fans of music. There is a reason it is in Rolling Stones top 100 recordings of all time. There is a rumour among critics that if someone does a top list of recordings and this one isn't in it then the list is considered rubbish.

B006WB7IN8|4.0|This book presents an absolutely gripping account of the horror of relationship violence which compelled me to finish it in an 8 hour sitting. However the good and bad men were drawn to extremes and the ending was pure Hollywood and ultimately implausible.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could never have enough of Gideon and Eva. They have a twisted past but gets through each day longing for each others companionship-a solution for their hurt that a doctor would not prescribe for them.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|Though I understand the cult/fans being discourage because it did seem like they didn't really pay much attention to John Carpenters version. The thing is like AIDS it has to connect bodily fluids to ensnare you. I got everyone on the connected basis but one. It was the head Norwegian Guy of the camp. I'm still trying to figure out how he got infected? Overall I loved if it was a stand thing I would it was awesome.

B004EPZ02A|3.0|I was so cited to see this because I love the original and the sequel. Plus the trailer made it promising but I was discourage because they 180 the storyline and thought it could have been better.
B00932A6G4|4.0|This movie is a guilty pleasure, the movie is unpretentious and takes a tongue in cheek view of itself. The actors are good, the bugs are magnificent... watch and enjoy... there are at least two more.....
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|I like Liam Neeson as an actor, Les Mis&eacute;rables (1998) is a favorite of mine, and so this winter I checked out The Grey at the local library. I thought the acting and cinematography was excellent. Unfortunately, the language was so bad that I had to practically mute the sound and opted for the closed captions instead (I have young children). Unlike The Chronicles of Narnia, this is not what I would call \\"family friendly\\" entertainment. It was suspenseful enough to keep my interest (despite the various inconsistencies and inaccuracies that other reviewers have noted), so I stayed on, right up to the dismal ending. It is a rather haunting movie, the kind that stays in your head for a while, so I thought a lot about the underlying philosophy. In the end, the film is more about man's existential predicament and the hiddeness of God, than it is about survival.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** After the long painstaking fight for survival, watching each one of his comrades die, one by one, from the wreck, related injuries, wolf attacks, the weather, falling out of a tree, exhaustion, despair, suicide, drowning, being without food, water, shelter, survival gear, rest and subject to the elements of nature, \\"the unlikely hero Ottway\\" lays on the ground, looking into the sky in desperation and cries out to God, \\"Do something. Do something!\\" After no response, he trails off in the bitter reality of being utterly alone to contend with the forces of nature, stating, \\"I'll do it myself.\\" We then see him kneeling in the snow going through the pictures in the wallets of the men who are dead. He looks at their families and then considers his own wife. With his wife being deceased, he only has her memory to give him any semblance of meaning, everything else is gone, including his hope of survival. At this point the wolf pack is upon him and the future is already played out. He remembers his father's poem and knows he must make his own choice and that with courage. Allowing fear to paralyze him is not an option. Meanwhile, he has no real reason to live, except for the sake of survival itself, no matter, he will make his choice and stand his ground, however futile it may be. He will not allow his circumstances to dictate his actions, he will not lay down and give up. This is our hero! At least according to the back of the box. ***END OF SPOILER***<br /><br />I think it is the meaninglessness and futility of it all that the one star reviewers found so disturbing about the film. It is more than having wasted two hours, it is becoming emotionally interested in the characters only to have all possible hope of survival dashed to pieces, but then the film goes on to take it another step further, in which it attempts to capture the finality of death and thus the essential meaninglessness of life. Francis Shaeffer has talked a lot about this despair. In The God Who is There, he explains how many atheists have tried to live as if there is no meaning in life, but their attempts have been utterly futile. Meanwhile, some antagonists accuse Christians of using a crutch, but it is just a simple fact that none of us can live under the psychological stress that atheism places man under, that is to say, it is impossible to live as though there is no meaning.<br /><br />There is an interesting existential wilderness story that Alvin Plantinga relates in his Spiritual Autobiography that relates to our hero's search for God. \\"There has been only one other occasion on which I felt the presence of God with as much immediacy and strength. That was when I once foolishly went hiking alone off-trail in really rugged country south of Mt. Shuksan in the North Cascades, getting lost when rain, snow and fog obscured all the peaks and landmarks. That night, while shivering under a stunted tree in a cold mixture of snow and rain, I felt as close to God as I ever have, before or since. I wasn't clear as to his intentions for me, and I wasn't sure I approved of what I thoughthis intentions might be (the statistics on people lost alone in that area were not at all encouraging), but I felt very close to him; his presence was enormously palpable. On many other occasions I have felt the presence of God, sometimes very powerfully: in the mountains (the overwhelming grandeur of the night sky from a slope at 13,000 feet), at prayer, in church, when reading the Bible, listening to music, seeing the beauty of the sunshine on the leaves of a tree or on a blade of grass, being in the woods on a snowy night, and on other kinds of occasions.\\"<br /><br />I find this to be a most interesting contrast of characters. You have renown Christian philosopher, Alvin Plantinga, who takes great comfort in knowing God's presence, especially when forced to face nature's fury, and then there is the angry existentialist who chooses to completely isolate himself as he contends with his certain dismal fate.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|I bought this movie cautiously because of the various negative reviews.  Everything from unbelieveable CGI to 'unbelievable' plot, to 'it didn't match the book'. And of course, there were the HD and sound purists who had their say as well.<br /><br />These people missed the point of this humorous, funny and horrific rewrite of American history. Put what you know on the side, put on your humorous hat and try to think of 'Sean of the Dead' meets 'President Lincoln'. It's not meant to be necessarily historically accurate, just a humorous, well-executed send-off of an absolutely great idea!  Who would have thought...Honest Abe slicing and dicing Zombies...oustanding!<br /><br />And as far as the 3D Video and Audio, far better than what I had braced myself for. Instead of breakup and fragmentation, a beautiful 3D highdef pic with outstanding sound...very pleased!<br /><br />The story goes full circle eventually ending where it starts. And you go, 'Ah' so that's what's going on there with a sense of knowing the characters. The portrayal of Lincoln was excellent and I highly recommend this Blu-ray 3D.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|This product does not work. I don't know what else to say, tried several times to get it to work then uninstalled it.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Unexpected outcome by a skilled writer.  Highly entertaining and easy to follow. Kept me in suspense with a variety of characters!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|purchased on black friday as i wanted this game forever. It installs but freezes after the intro video. you would think the makers would want to fix this issue just to save their own reputation, but maybe mobile game companies dont care. Very sad...

B007EE4XKI|4.0|Cool new story about Data's family, although the plot itself is just another TNG episode. The Typhon Pact is getting scarier.
B00124BNF4|5.0|If you don't have all their albums and you like the Talking Heads than this is a must. Best songs from a great alternative rock group.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The research behind this novel educated me about a period I was less familar with. The intriguing characters carried the history with ease. I learned so much geography as I followed The Maps intensely.

B003MC5N28|5.0|Although ,I am a senior citizen, I thought this book was thought provoking. I would especially recommend it for young adults. It would provoke interesting discussions for a Book Club of any age.It stirred my senses.
B00136JS12|4.0|I needed to beef up this genre in my iPod. And this was a great option. It also has several great running songs on it that I hadn't thought of before.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie seems to be getting back to the themes of the animated movies on the 90's and early 2000's. It is one that adults and kids can appreciated. The movie visually looks amazing, sounds great and has a great message within it.

0553381407|3.0|The reason I chose this rating is because in the first half of the book the author explains a lot about the different types of problems that occur in households with toxic parents, but in the latter half of the book she neglects to mention all the solutions for the scenarios brought up in the first half.  There were at least two different issues I would have liked more clarity on and in the second half of the book it was totally skipped and I got the feeling the rest of the book was rushed and not well thought through.<br />Thank you
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I got this game when it was free and it sounded kind of interesting. Great graphics and an interesting story. I am not very far yet but it is holding my interest. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Definitely lots of fun. I like it better than most of the other games of its type. Wish there were more goals & missions though.
1857885082|1.0|there were maybe four \\"insights\\" on the English...the rest you could figure out yourself by people watching for a few minutes. The book was long winded and repetitive beyond belief.  Is a recap really necessary at the end of each chapter? The book could have been a third of its size and price. It reminded me of those school papers we all wrote that required a certain number of words and we basically rearranged the same data over and over to meet the criteria. I was so looking forward to this book and cannot think of a book I have been more disappointed in.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game captures the show perfectly and really shows just how elegant mobile app games can be when done correctly.  The game isbloaded with little mini games that Ned tplo b completed to advance which breaks the traditional monotony of these &quot;village management&quot; games.  The graphics and sound are spot on, the gameplay is clean and intuitive, overall the game is compelling and fun.  The only real downside is the somewhat repetative nature of the mini games.
1417734027|5.0|Loved this book as a kid and love it still today.  Had a great time sharing this with my friend's eight year old grand daughter.
0061928356|5.0|It was a real page turner and kept my interest.  Also needed plenty of kleenex.  I just couldn't imagine how this book could end well.  It certainly gave a good idea of what it was like living at a lighthouse.
0525953728|5.0|Can't help but have a great admiration for those people who take on these roles that help keep our society protected. Worth a read - it's an easy read and facsinating.
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved it - best read in a long time.  It was very well written and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Can play this while doing puzzles or watching Tv.  Builds up to having special bonuses and coins so buying is not required.  Its not a fast paced game but really fun nonetheless.  Great time filler.  Lmills
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is a very excellent movie. You can get somewhat of how solders and also how things may have gone during the war. Is very graffic. Am must see film.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good page turner with quite a few nice turns and twists along the way, a  quick and satisfying summer travel read.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is a nice game to check on every once in a while. I'll play it for about ten minutes, then a few hours later I'll check on it again. Its not a game that you play for hours on end. Mostly, its a game that you play when you're waiting for your next class to start, during television commercials, or, for some, to take with you to the bathroom.<br />It's an energy based game, which means you have to wait 3 minutes for 1 energy, which can be frustrating for some and make it not worth playing. But like I siad, it's good if you only play it for ten minutes every few hours.<br />What makes me give it three stars however, is the fact that its one of those games that pushes you to buy in game money. I truly dislike those kind of games. It's fine if its only optional, but this game makes it so that you HAVE to buy their in game money in order to complete the assignments given. I've got a total of 12 active quests right now, and 6 of them require me to purchase in game money in order to complete them. I won't do it. If it gets to the point where the only quests left for me to do are the ones that require me to purchase in game money, I'll just uninstall it.<br />Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this game to people that want more than a ten minute at a time game, or to those like myself that think paying 20 bucks for a digital house is stupid.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|In a world, where tv shows have gone to dust. They have finally made one worth watching, this show is refreshing and so compelling. Every episode grabs your attention, and pulls you in from the minute it starts. There have not been that many superhero shows, that stay true to the comics, yet also add a new storyline to it, that makes it great. Stephen Amell is the ideal Oliver Queen, who plays the playboy type to perfection, however also makes a great superhero. Every episode has you sitting on the edge of your seat, rooting for Green Arrow all the way. This show is definitely worth watching, for any superhero fan and some new ones.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Jessica Lange is in season 2 also, but the storyline is a completely different one.<br />Do NOT watch this right before going to bed is all I have to say! ha ha
B007HC3LHS|4.0|The first few chapters were a bit confusing,but then I finally got that every other chapter was before then after the terrible event in the heroines life. The author def keeps you engaged.
B000J025AE|5.0|Loved the first Poseidon Adventure and this remake was great and not a disappointment.  Good acting and good casting.  Worth a watch!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Amazon can do better.  I purchased the app today for 99 cents for my son and it does not play.  It shows beginning video then resets back to app selection screen.  Tried  a hard reset to make sure it was not the kindle having the issue.  Same problem after reset.  Some reviews say it works others say it doesn't.  My kindle fire has plenty of space so that's not an issue.  Great way to steal 99 cents amazon...  I would like a refund.  I suggest not buying this software unless the bugs can be worked out.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not impressed.  Obviously something an over the hill lonely woman fanticized about.  It all sounds great on paper but it's just not reality
B008EZVNO0|5.0|The CD arrived well before the expected time limit so I was thrilled and who could not love a Van Morrison CD?
B0044MIIA4|5.0|Delain delivers once again with this fantastic album.  The tracks are all top notch and well worth listening to.  Delain is a superb band with a great tradition established of great music.  Hope they keep it up!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Our granddaughter requested a copy for her birthday after seeing it in school, This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product. I would recommend them without reservation.
B007B6T3K4|5.0|The album that angels would sing if they were here.  The soaring lyrics and amazing instrumentals that make this album up are incredible.  This is one of my current faves and will continue to be for the future I am sure.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product; super fast service. I would recommend them without reservation.
B007918P1E|3.0|The previews on this album sounded pretty good.  After purchase, I was only mildly interested in this music.  It quickly made its way off of my regular play list.  Not sure if any of their other efforts are any better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You was a great book very intense can I say that again VERY INTENSE and emotional I cried a couple of times and that is just something that I never do. I got so caught up in this one. It was so romantic. I can't wait for the next one of the series. I am counting down the days.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|I just love this album.  The instrumentals and lyrics are amazing.  This is my first Kamelot album.  I am sure that many mroe will follow.
B007L4HET8|2.0|Very disappointed with venom, ruined the whole movie for me. He was a very water down version compared to the comics. It seems like they spent all their money casting the movie hoping it would bring a bigger audience. The story was pretty week too, and I had high hopes when this came out. Over all after the movie was over I felt like I had just watched them slam spider man against a pinball machine and.. well you know.
B008B3F38C|5.0|Delain hits it out of the park with this album.  This is some of the best music I have purchased in recent memory.  I cant wait for more Delain to come out!
1469984202|5.0|I read about 5-6 books per week and am a long time science fiction fan. This is the first time I've ever bothered to write a review.<br /><br />I read this Omnibus in the past 2 days, could not put it down, and was up to 2am finishing it off.<br /><br />After the past few years reading so much of the same flavoured storylines and narratives I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever read something that caught me unawares, and this book certainly delivered. It felt fresh and new, the plot was well considered and paced nicely, the characters were fleshed out also.<br /><br />There was also a nice balance within all the characters between their flaws and triumphs. I didn't feel like any character was superhuman either in their 'good' or 'evil' roles. A little bit of the book I have to admit to skim reading, particularly the uprising of Mechanical. I felt it got a little bogged, but hey, that's just me.<br /><br />I also felt there was a real strength in the writing to make it feel like there was an ensemble cast and I came away wanting to hear more from each- From Juliette, to Walker, to Bernard, Lukas, Jimmy, Elise etc.<br /><br />Hugh- I want more background! I want to know the how's and why's. I want to know what happens to the baby in Silo 17. I want the back story. We're going to need another few books here. :)<br /><br />All these 'wants' clearly indicate this book delivered.<br /><br />I also read the Author's notes at the end. What impressed me on a personal level is that the author comes across as funny, intelligent, but also demonstrated humility. That struck a chord with me and ensures I will invest my hard earned cashes in his creativity again.<br /><br />Thanks Hugh for a great read. You've definitely found what you're meant to do on the planet.
B0011ZWKDS|5.0|Nightwish hits hard with this album.  Although it isn't another Century Child, it is a great album and well worth the listen.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|after deleting a bunch of stuff so I would have the space for the download I installed it to get a short intro video then returned back to the kindle home screen. too bad I was really looking forward to playing this one guess I'll pay closer attention to the reviews before making purchases<br /><br />Update I found out it works when WiFi is turned off noe that I have played the game it is a lot of fun and my kids love it so if you are being returned to home after intro just turn WiFi off I have updated it to 3 stars from 1
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|While this film is not groundbreaking it is quite interesting and very well put together. You can't criticize too much here. The acting and directing are all very good. Real life footage is cut with the film seamlessly and you get a good idea on what goes on behind the scenes for some of these small ball teams in the MLB. This has my full recommendation if you are interested in sports and film.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I believe, the story was fascinating but a bit too technically detailed as to his illness and the depths of these explanations were to an average person like me. The ending was a bit abrupt with a high percentage of the pages left - until the many additional pages were used to thank the many who helped. I acknowledge that they who were instrumental should be thanked but maybe as a forward or an addition but included as a percentage of the book seemed a bit much to me.<br /><br />If you have faith doubts or questions this is a nice read and a confirmation of belief; for that alone I recommend it.<br /><br />A true believer in God and the life after death promise<br /><br />JWW
B000NOKA0S|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this. I am still making my way through all of his CDs but there is no doubt at all that this is a statement and one that is hard to top. Suzanne, Winter Lady, Marianne, etc. and a great bonus cut in Storeroom to boot. The remastering is fabulous. I wouldn't even think twice about picking this up. It's that good.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Very engrossing novel.  The battle descriptions are a little long but over all a good book.  I like to have lots of characters to keep track of.
B008XG1X18|4.0|a bit slow to load, but it does work!  I can look at my boards or anyone else's, search for pins, and even repin stuff.  fix the loading speed &amp; 5 stars!
1451662432|5.0|This book was very informative and I learned a lot about his younger years while growing up in Austria. Love him or hate him you can not discount his ability to create a vision and his unwavering drive towards making it a reality. This book is a lesson to set goals and create a path towards them.
0439023521|5.0|Easy to read and much more details than the movie. Would recommend to every age, easy to understand and enjoy.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As with his four prior volumes, George R.R. Martin keeps your attention with his &#34;character-specific&#34; chapters.  There is always a surprise as he does not stick to the familiar tenant that a popular character always has to survive.  The continuous introduction of new characters keeps interest high.  My understanding is that there are two more chapters and I can't wait for the next one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book, written simply that anyone can understand and read quickly. Would recommend this book to everyone who loves to read.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I can't wait to get this to my door the 12/04... this is an amazing movie that everyone must watch.
B000059TCE|5.0|Daughter loves these movies. Fun and funny, also cute and entertaining. Would recommend to anyone who loves dogs and cuteness.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|awesome and entertaining movie to watch with everyone in the family.  It was a breeze to watch it via amazon plus
1419702238|5.0|Love the hardback book, last longer and can read over and over. Would recommend, my 15 year old still likes to read these.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|After reading a while, I like to check in at Facebook.  The ap makes it possible, but it is not as complete as on the  computer.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Love lady and the tramp. Can't say enough about this movie. Would recommend to anyone who loves a love story.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett helps history come alive by telling the story through human personalities.  I remember what it like during the ending years of WWII.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|You do not have to be a fan of Tim Burton to love this movie. However, I happen to be. Johnny Depp is so funny because he really remains committed to his character. I think this movie got average reviews which was undeserving. I laughed from start to finish.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Story is a little dis-jointed. Actor are good especially the women. Good special effects.  Still unsure of the engineers and why they were so hostel to humans.  They created humans then want to destroy us?
B008GXHOFW|1.0|When I opened the app I couldn't wait. I have wanted for weeks. I watched the intro and then the screen went black. I am so mad! :(  :(
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's the only show on television that I've lost sleep over - I finished the first two seasons in two days...It sounds extreme, to say the least, but that's how addictive this show is. Brilliant! I can't wait for season 3!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It is an exciting show --only one show in eighth season needs to be S-canned is &#34;BITTEN&#34; that was so unprofessional!!! All others were very good!! Waiting for episode #8--2 weeks to see?????
B006LSZECO|5.0|The tale of a toxic relationship that kept me up all night reading.  Was recommended by several friends and was totally worth it!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Left behind on Mars with only his wits and abandoned equipment available to concoct various schemes to survive to the next Mars mission.<br /><br />This is a rollicking and exciting story.  The Martian has to overcome unending problems that threaten to kill him, or leave him on Mars forever.<br /><br />Brains and training are what makes this story work, not magic devices or hokey plot scams.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this story from top to bottom.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|You can only got 1 or 2 levels deep before they require you to pay money to move forward.  it moves a little fast for my 6 year old but she still likes it.  Stopped playing it after a few days though because we won't allow her to spend money on it.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Shows like Breaking Bad are the reason God invented the DVD box set. There are so many plot twists, so many startling character turns, and so many layers of behavior in this series, I can't imagine having to wait a week between installments. In Season Four we learn a great deal about Gus, Walt and Jesse learn a great deal about themselves, and we get to watch the most brilliantly written series since The Wire went dark. The season finale is every bit as outrageous as you've heard, and the final shot opens up a chasm of darkness with what it suggests about Walt's moral decay.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Totally enjoying Tim Ferriss' latest book: The 4-Hour Chef. Even though I'm waiting 'til next week to start the practical cooking exercises, I'm already making simple combinations with my food that tastes great.<br /><br />Just like most American guys, I'm super busy all the time and have few down-time moments, especially not many in which I feel like I want to tackle the enormous bell curve of either learning how to cook or following a long recipe that I'll just screw up anyhow. The 4-Hour Chef speaks directly to me.<br /><br />Actually, I met Tim Ferriss in person when he launched The 4-Hour Workweek at SXSW. That meeting let me get a glimpse of Ferriss' personality, which really is high-energy, confident, go-go-go. That personality carries over into all of his books.<br /><br />Some readers, I've noticed, don't \\"get\\" Ferriss' personality. This in an age where the concept of exceptionalism and self-confidence have become taboo--especially stateside. Ferriss is a true renegade. He may have some scatter-brain moments and attempt to tackle huge mountains, but at least he's doing it.<br /><br />Some of his ideas may seem \\"off.\\" Simply don't do them. But what any reader who approaches his books with an open-mind and a willingness to learn something within and beyond the subject title, will receive much benefit from a different perspective.<br /><br />I, for one, appreciate how boldly Ferriss approaches the subject of cooking--for the average Joes and Janes--and how he unashamedly shares the extra insights of how he attempts to master his own life. In this book, there were two very useful life insights that I have already put in action.<br /><br />For my already better cooking (and soon to be date-impressing) and for new life skills I've acquired from reading The 4-Hour Chef, I recommend it to my dearest friends and to all the friends I haven't met yet.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Just started watching season 1 and 2 of the series on netflix. We were anxious to see season 3. It's tough to wait a whole week to see what happens next, butso far the season is progressing along well. The family is glad I purchased.
0385535147|4.0|This was a very good book.  There definitely some surprises.  I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the Litagators but I would recommend wholeheartedly.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait to read the final book!! The characters were great, loveable and I am always rooting for them. Even when I don't understand what is going on!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a fun, fun, fun game. I have this solotaire app on my kindle fire. I have not had any problems. It always works as it should. Solitaire is a great way to stay occupied and keep your brain active when needing to pass a little time. Fun game, great app, I recommend it!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I only knew two of the songs when I bought this but within a day I love them all. Usually albums will have one or two song I tend to skip when playing but these are all worth listening to every time.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|totally a great rendition of Emma. this is the forth adaptation of Jane Austin's fun packed novel that I have seen, and it was definitely the best. I used to like the A&E version, but the all around superior actors and time spent on this film surpassed my best expectations of yet another attempt to portray the fun loving people in the tale accurately. As an avid Austin fan, Emma is probably my favorite story, and this movie was even better then the book I felt. Great job BBC!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford and Sons manages to have songs with several different moods that all seem to fit together. From the upbeat Babel to more slow and sad songs like Ghosts That We Knew they manage to make them all amazing.<br /><br />A little disappointed that Home isn't on this album, but I knew that before I bought it and the songs that are on it are all just as good. If you like Mumford and Sons or any similar music then you'll live this album. The bonus songs definitely make it worth buying the CD version.
B00755MHXG|4.0|This is a great story for middle level readers.  While the plot is predictable and slightly canned, the writing is wonderfully engaging.  A very &#34;teachable&#34; book for middle school or early high school.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|Duh what is the point of an app on Kindle that ONLY works when online ?! You cannot even review notes when offline. Dumb.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|This book is being used for an English lit course.  We are finding it to be an interesting and thoughtful read.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|I'm loving the show 'cause I tend to like superhero features and Amell is a nice looking superhero. I think his acting style is kind of wooden but I'm still trying to figure out if it's his acting or if his acting choice as a way to represent a PTSD individual who has been on an island for 5 years and who was tortured at some point during that time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an interesting read.  It was hard to put down with a sad ending.  This book is well written.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|It's not as awful as the name would have you believe. It was a good action flick that satisfies the lovers of the genre. Many things were predictable but if you like the genre then you'll like this flick.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This book was a text book for an English lit course.  We are using it and find it to be an interesting read.
0740748475|5.0|Words cannot describe how awesome this collection truly is. For any Calvin and Hobbes fan this is an absolute must have!
B000FCKC4C|1.0|I found the book dull, repetitive, and uninspiring. I would not recommend it to anyone. I don't understand all the hoopla about this book.
B00634GHJA|1.0|I used to love this app, but after several months of frustrating failures to connect to home PC. I'm pulling the plug. My wife has been in contact with the developer numerous times and nothing came of it. It now falls to the rating of P.O.S.  Shame too, because it &quot;used to&quot; be awesome.
B004RPPNJM|4.0|Fantastic sequel to the incredible Ender's Game. This book is much more emotional and not as heavy on strategy and tactics as the first, but it shows why Ender is such a great leader and is set apart from others that are simply analytically brilliant.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a really, really good show. I watched the whole season in two days over a weekend--just had to see it. If you buy it, you won't  be disappointed.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I bought this movie Annie for my kids. They loved it, great purchase!! It was at a very great price too and great quality made.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Im completely obsesssed with MLP i have posters and notebooks and little charecter figures! Everypony... i mean everybody should play this. :) :) :o
B002BWP49C|5.0|Me and the kids love Twilight saga: Can't wait till Part II is coming out on DVD. I am very happy with this item!!
B0048KXRR6|3.0|This sequel suffers from what seems to be a typical syndrome;  it is not as good as the original movie.  It has its sweet elements:  the scenery is beautiful, there is a happy ending, Emma Thompson is her lovely self at the end and Maggie Smith is a delight, as always.  But....the plot is predictable and the fantastical magical elements are contrived.  I did like Nanny McPhee's crow familiar who had a lot of charming personality.  The movie did make me smile and brought moments of misty-eyed sentiment, but I don't need to own this or see it again.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|easy to get info on weather fast and effective. it even has a 10 day forecast! allows special alerted I. your area. one drawback is that it requires wifi to use :)
B009RI4FRU|2.0|I gave this movie only two stars but it is the service that earned the stars not the movie.  I never got to see the movie....I rented it for my wife and i to watch but we never got the chance....The rental was removed because there is a set amount of time Amazon will wait before taking your money and not let you watch it.  I think it the time from is 2 weeks.....not sure why they limit that...if I paid the money let it sit in my library until i get the chance to watch.<br /><br />never will rent a money until we sit down to start watching it.....
B008GXHOFW|1.0|For some reason the game shows the intro but stops working after. I can't even play it. Luckily the game only cost me 0.99 but I'm disappointed I can't play.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|What can I say? Was recommended to me by someone with no interested in sci fi or fantasy. It's a grandly epic tale that tells a broad story through very personal insights and interviews.<br /><br />The personal stories and characters are engrossing.<br /><br />Scarily believable in its presentation the stupidity, greed, madness, resourcefulness and courage of mankind.
0688014291|4.0|This book is for the real manager who is looking for ways to improve efficiency, and just the overall attitude of a company or corporation..
B009HV2JT8|4.0|There are many movies made by Hollywood every year that suffer from the same thing - banality (stereotypes, predictability, boooorrrrinng). This movie, while honestly mediocre, has refreshing moves in it. I found it to be bold in some way and relationship between characters surprisingly realistic and honest. I like that the epic, final battle was when Lincoln was already aged. But the fighting scenes are ridiculous :)))
0547884591|5.0|Love the work by done by tim. Being a medical professional myself, I love how this book is made simple to read yet includes detailed delineations, which makes it a joy to read, going down to almost the biochemistry of things sometimes.<br /><br />Perhaps you should make a book called the four hour dentist!<br /><br />Jas.
0142501123|5.0|An amazing halloween book! Great pictures, great story line. Every child would love to have this book read to them.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ACCURATE!  I'm a hunter and have found that it doesn't alway work.  It has to have wi-fi.  So when I use it, I check before I go.  It's also handy for traveling to check on the weather where ever you will be the next day.
034580404X|5.0|A definite must have. All three books are great, especially the 2nd one. And no it's not just about the sex, but to be honest it was more about the story line and the suspense that made me enjoy these books so much more! After every chapter, you just want to read the next one right away.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love Stephanie Myers. And this saga. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Wish there were more to this series.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|literally couldn't put it down    a all night session i got so involved    see others are coping the character type a sure sign of success
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is super cute and super addictive, I wasn't exactly a fan of My Little Pony before I found this game but now I love it
B008GXHOFW|2.0|love the game graffex are awsome game play is fun..... BUT...... game is so big keeps making my kindle freeze when it works shutting the whole thing down when it don't... iv reinstalled twice does not help quite upset I paid money for it..
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart sings these Christmas songs so well.  I really enjoyed hearing them sung by him.  I will listen to this cd all season.
B007704HO6|5.0|One of the best books I have read this year. Such a lovely story.<br /> Amazing how James turned his life round while caring for Bob.It would make a good film.<br />Hope Bob and James have many more years together.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really great free game.  The puzzles start out very easy, and progressively get harder.  The very largest size can be quite challenging.  There are a lot of levels for a free game, as well.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|The digital copy will not transfer to my iTunes library. It states that the redemption code is not valid. I have attempted to enter the exact code provided multiple times and I keep getting this refusal.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game!  It's similar to Where's My Water, so if you like that, you will like this.  Kids and adults would both enjoy this; it's simple enough for kids, but not so simple that adults will be bored.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all the Reacher novels and this is not the best of stories in my mind.  Maybe the next one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was one of the best Stephen King books I've ever read!  I've been a fan for many years.  It was interesting to see what would have happened if indeed history was messed with.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Finally, a book for western medicine men and women!  For all the skeptics out there, a must read. Amazing how we believe so many things that are fear based and books like this come along that are proof of the eternal life and they are dismissed so easily. It's a funny world here on this earth!
B0053O89RY|2.0|I'm fairly certain the dvd I purchased is a pirated copy.  It doesn't seem right compared to the other seasons.  It plays fine, though.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is the best puzzle game I have ever played. Period. It is so simple, yet so complex! Great idea to the creator of this game.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loves this move. I have yet to watch it but he is sure to have me sooner or later I am sure.
B00122S4KS|5.0|I rarely like every song on a album, but this one is the exception. Everyone song is amazing, and Paramore is one of the best bands ever.
B008KEQMDC|4.0|This movie was not all of what I was expecting but still all in all a cute enough movie to watch once in awhile.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I loved Star Wars as a child. Now my kids are into it. I love watching it again! Yeah Star Wars
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I enjoy this movie. I had my husband watch it for the first time and he enjoyed it as well.
B000YHG72E|4.0|The movie had several funny parts. A great show to get into the Christmas spirit. My 7 year old enjoyed it more than my 5 and 3 year old
B008673ZAQ|5.0|eva and gideon are still trying to figure each other out in this second book and even though theres LOTS of sex and controlling issues it seems to work for them! if any one reading this book has ever been through a little fraction of what these two have been through then youll be cheering them along like i do!! some of us would even commit crimes of passion for the ones we love!
B000WCDBKM|4.0|Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors. Put him in a thriller/ horror flick and I know this is a movie for me. Pop it in, sit back and enjoy.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|Hi, I never write reviews, but this album has caught my attention. The music is fresh and a welcome. Unnecessary over use of obscenities, however. The vocals are beautifully diffused in the sound field. The bass and drums are remarkably well miked and recorded! The instruments are remarkably well defined, and compliment the lovely vocals. The dynamic range is frighting. A very full-range system is required to experience the full depths of the 20Hz notes that go well into the subsonic range.<br /><br />It is a pleasure to hear  audiophile quality sound from an indie artist. My ears are critical to a level that some would consider pathological, and my audio playback equipment is extremely revealing and second to none.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|Not quite as good as the Facebook version, but it will keep me occupied away from my laptop. Perhaps it will be updated to more closely match the parent version.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie itself was great. Choosing to rent movies from Amazon is sometimes difficult. It did not buffer very quickly, and the pop out version was not working well at all.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford & Sons never disappoints. This album is absolutely incredible. Bought it at least a month ago and still listening non-stop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you like good music at all.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was so cool to watch in 3D, and there were so many extra scenes that weren't shown on the regular dvd. :)
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Every year I have a favorite Christmas album that I can't stop listening to. This was it last year, and it's about to be the favorite this year as well. Absolutely stellar.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|This housing has made my life so much simpler. I set this on my dash and plug it straight in to the cigareete lighter and I can run this thing all day while going out for a drive!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|i think im a grinch for animated movies now.  i used to watch them all but it seems i cant stand them (although i saw wreck it ralph and that was awesome).  this is kinda boring and predictable. but im sure kids love it
B001B2CPH2|4.0|a classic to see that haunts you even after it has long been played.Yes I di d enjoy thi s movie.
B0046MOVD0|4.0|great 3d movie with all the cheesy special effects.  decent movie not in 3d.  but if you are reading this you probably are reading reviews for some funny comments. so big bada boom oops wrong milla movie
B0037QM8YA|1.0|very painful life very hard to watch... abuse is too much to take in as a flick.... gave me uneasy nightmares for a couple days... just too intense for a sensitive soul. DO NOT let any children see this. it is that intense. was there any abuse not depicted in here? Think it covered it all. language was all F bombs and other sleazy words. had a good message but I would rather read about it in the news not see it up front and in person. Just too difficult to watch for entertainment. Brilliant cast and all that.... but too harsh for me thank you. Intensely disturbing!  just my thoughts.
B008MM9630|5.0|this is a fun little game .I like games that have farms and magic and this game pulls them together nicely
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. It was worth buying it with the ultraviolet copy because I can watch anywhere I am.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it's fun and can kill some time :-) one of the better seek games out there. friends ask me all the time if they can search for things too.
B0045XICB2|4.0|This movie is definitely better than the previous two. The acting could be better, of course, but it seems to be headed in the right direction.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|good app plays well on kindle fire.  far too many ads.  great graphics size of tiles are small but readable.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|This is the best of the series to date. The acting has gotten better and the storyline is exciting. Getting better!
B007TVANDM|5.0|My 5 year old could read this book; it was colorful and the words were big enough to read on my tablet.  God buy for early readers
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Another great one by Sylvia Day. I have fallen in love with Gideon, even though he is possessive. I think every girl wantes to be wanted like that!
B0043EV774|5.0|My daughters love this movie and even more in 3D. They have watched this movie for the umpteenth time. Definitely keeps them occupied on long trips.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is one of my favorite authors. I really fell in love with this sequel and am counting down until the next. Very well written and makes you fall in love with the characters all over again.
B004OC07N0|5.0|I Started reading it, the first couple of pages was kinda borning, but by page 18 it was becoming intresting, now i'm half way through and realy wana continue!<br /><br />Very useful, full of tools, ideas, thoughts, it has helped me plan a move a couple of weeks ahead, now i know what kinda mess i was going to walk into.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|Another great disc by this great band. Quick turnaround on the sale and mailing! Thanks for a fantastic sale guys
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I was expecting a lot more. Not bad and definitely worth watching but not what I was hoping it would be.  I guess I'm sick of movies trying to be so deep.  I'd just like to be entertained sometimes.  Can we just have a Serenity 2?
B009CPGHDI|4.0|Rented on my smart tv as a streaming video. Worked very well, cheaper than Direct tv rental. Would recommend, ok for kids.
0741470314|5.0|Had to read the book, as I spent my formative pop music-years, dancing to Jackson Five music at eighth grade dances. Now I realize I was spoiled, growing up to the Michael Jackson sound. His voice, that music, was for me, the threshold of how musical talent should be. His music, ushered me into my teens, and I enjoyed growing into adulthood with the Thriller Album.  I watched with interest, the metamorphasis of his looks, sound, dance.  When the news broke of his legal issues, along with his continued change in appearance, seclusions, and yet, continued fresh material, I looked for a way to personally reconcile all of this.<br />Dr. Moriarty's book does just that by revealing the facts not presented in the press. At the same time, she has a knack for allowing the reader, in an existential way, to see how Michael Jackson's journey was very reactive for him. I came away with the realization of how difficult it must have been for him to have to play wack-a-mole to all the trappings of fame and fortune. The sum, was thus, a portrait of a tragic figure, yet simultaneously, his musical artistry made him the Salvador Dali of his time. Kudos to the author.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Tragically, my teenage granddaughter and my daughter chose this movie to watch for girls night out.  Within 5 minutes, grandmother was mortified.  Daughter and granddaughter were both embarrassed.  How very sad that this is what is given to the younger generations as entertainment.  Worst $3.99 I have ever spent.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferris' new book is a progression of his life of experimentation and upending of old ways of approaching life, whether it be work, exercise or food.  It's a book as much about learning and challenging yourself as it is about cooking.  A worthy read for those who want to cook more, eat better and find life more satisfying.
098555780X|5.0|I enjoy looking at all the different styles of braiding with Paracord.  The instructions are easy to follow and understand Great tool for the tool box.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|How does this work, so spoiled to get apps like this. Everyone needs to download this one! It knows every song.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I always like Nicholas Sparks books and this one is no exception.  Very enjoyable - held my  attention!!!!  Very relevant<br />to today's problems for military persons.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is an amazing movie. The music is fabulous! The story is moving and always makes me cry. We find ourselves humming or singing the songs  for days after we watch it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|play this game.it is great.i will play it all night!!!!'''!...it is the best game you can play it has so many games.You will love all of them
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I really do love this series. hard to wait till season two becomes avaliable for FREE, but not much choice.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am obsessed with the Fifty Shades series and hate that I'm done with all 3 books!  I want to read them again, they were that good to me.
B009J2VR3Y|2.0|There is no way for Whitney's legacy to be summed up with one disc. Miracle, Lover for Life, My Name is Not Susan, Run to You, For the Love of You, etc...I could go on forever! Please do better!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love the Hunger Games series!  I think I read all 3 books in one week because they were so addicting!
B000IKQK7E|5.0|Everyone needs to see the movie Animal House at least once in their life. There's nothing quite like it! Highly recommended.
B00650SSDU|5.0|I am borderline obsessed with this movie! I have seen it so many times.  I have it on DVD, DVR and my Kindle Fire and it is still funny after about 50 times.
0547884591|5.0|This is a book about so much more than cooking.  I teach at an online school and what this book has to say about learning and skill building is utterly invaluable.  The first part of the book is entirely on how people learn and the shortcuts you can take to acquire a skill quickly.  As someone trying to help people do just that this book has already helped tremendously. There are several of us at the school reading this book right now and I can think of several people who will be getting this under the xmas tree.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I LOVE the O.C.! I used to watch this show in high school and had to see it again. I wish it never ended!
0374275637|3.0|I am familiar with Daniel Kahneman's work through  many of his essays and articles in various magazines in the past. I had always found them thought-provoking, interesting and challenging established notions. That is why I was excited to read this book on Behavioral psychology by him. However, this book lived up to my expectations only partially. One reason is that the author's contention that 'our intuitive preferences are more influential than rational choice' gets well established fairly early in the book through the many experiments that he describes. Consequently, I felt a sense of repetition in the latter half of the book and gradually felt that the book lost steam completely towards the closing sections.<br /><br />To put it simply, the book says that there are two systems which drive the way we think and make choices. The author calls them System 1 and System 2.  System 1 is intuitive, quick and influenced by emotion. System 2 is slower, rational, logical and reflective. The author's research says that System 1 is more influential than what our experience tells us and it is the subliminal determinant of the many choices and judgments that we make. This is contrary to our general belief that we are very rational in our decision-making. The many example experiments that the book outlines show us that we must really be a lot more watchful in the assurance with which we trust our decisions as rooted in rationality. To me, this is the biggest lesson from the book.<br /><br />A few other points of interest from the book are:<br /><br />1. Luck plays a large role in every story of success. The author illustrates it with the telling contemporary example of the founders of Google willing to sell their company for less than $1 million but  the buyer thought that the price was too high!<br />2. High intelligence does not make people immune to biases<br />3. Rationality should be distinguished from  intelligence.<br />4. While talking about the consequences of Priming, the author points to a conclusion that may be an indictment of capitalist society. He says that living in a culture that surrounds us with constant reminders of money may shape our behavior and attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.<br />5. On the subject of Intuition vs Formulas, the author quotes a memorable formula of researcher Robyn Dawes:<br />Marital Stability = frequency of lovemaking - frequency of quarrels!<br />6. In the final section of the book, titled 'Two Selves', the author dabbles into the question of human happiness. Two statements caught my attention.<br />a. The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?<br />b. There is low correlation between individuals' circumstances and their satisfaction with life. The reason is that both experienced happiness and life satisfaction are largely determined by the genetics of temperament.<br /><br />In this context, I wondered whether the author is aware of Friedrich Nietzsche's  contention that animals are happy because they lack a capacity for past memories. Perhaps the author's term 'genetics of temperament' include a capacity to forget the past and move on with life.<br /><br />I found it educational and interesting in parts but somewhat disappointing overall, given my initial expectations from the author.the author points to a conclusion that may be an indictment of capitalist society.

B000GYI32M|5.0|I wish the O.C. never ended!  I was obsessed with this show in high school and have probably watched the seasons several times!
0446580848|4.0|Intersting and topical tale. Likeable characters. Good to see Paul Brenner again. Just too much unresolved at the end. Our heros are betrayed and those that do the betraying are left to be dealt with, presumably in another outing. If it's going to be a multi parter I would just as soon know that upfornt so I can decide if and when I want to get involved. (I didn't start the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo books until the final volume was out) Actually I would prefer that aside from continuing characters, that major plot threads are resolved in the volume that they're raised. Otherwise I liked the book right up until what I consider the premature wrap up ending.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am obsessed with the Fifty Shades series and hate that I'm done with all 3 books!  I want to read them again, they were that good to me.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|You only get a few plays available a day and then they want you to pay for them.  Not interested in that.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the Hunger Games series!  I think I read all 3 books in one week because they were so addicting!
B007FG9LIE|2.0|It was suspenseful, but not at all what I was expecting. I was not happy with the ending at all.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|I never watched Transformers or knew much about it until I was dragged to the first Transformers movie.  How can you not love the series?  Hot guys, hot cars and very attention grabbing!  Dark of the Moon is probably my favorite of the three so far.
034580404X|5.0|I LOVE THE CHARACTERS AND ALSO THE STORY LINE I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE IF THE MOVIE DOES THE BOOKS JUSTICE IF NOT I WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I am obsessed with New Girl! Zooey Deschanel is hilarious!  The first season is a must have if you are a fan of the show!
0425263908|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT<br />I RECOMMEND THIS SERIES JUST AS MUCH OR BETTER THAN FIFTY SHADES OF GRAY I HAVE READ THEM TWICE
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the Hunger Games series!  I think I read all 3 books in one week because they were so addicting!
0425263916|5.0|I loved both books and I can hardly wait for the third book.  I LOVE GIDEON CROSS ONLY IF HE WAS REAL....LOL
0743290127|5.0|I loved thsi book!  Lauren Weisberger is one of my favorite authors.  This book is nothing short of amazing and I would highly recommend it!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Watched it with my eleven year old daughter. She liked it alot and thought it was funny. My husband and I liked it too. I thought it would be too scarey for young kids.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I expected the movie to be predictable.  I actually loved it until Friends With Benefits came out around the same time.  Friends With Benefits was a better version of the typical situation!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is well designed with excellent detail and smooth play.  There are lots of options and the video graphics are excellent.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am obsessed with the Fifty Shades series and hate that I'm done with all 3 books!  I want to read them again, they were that good to me.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like the componsite weather radar maps that can show the weather anywhere in the US.  I recommend this app to anyone wanting to track the weather.
0805066691|5.0|This book broke my heart, as it should. Our country is great, and yet we still need to own the misdeeds and injustices against first nation people who were already here.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|The main character's stereotyping and bigotry may be off-putting to some people, but it is a necessary evil to fully appreciate his personality and history.  This has to be one of the best movies I've ever watched.  Clint Eastwood is awesome!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Prepare to lose a few hours to this, hard to put down. Beautiful graphics. Well thought out story line. Creepy and a bit macabre, absolutely worth the cost.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it's fairly easy lots of side games to keep you entertained.  it crashes on me sometimes though so that can be frustrating.
0547884591|5.0|Another fantastic book from Tim Ferriss.  Always delivers impeccable material and interesting content.  The Four Hour Chef goes step by step into how to learn practically anything using Tim's always fantastic real word examples.  Bought the hard copy and a Kindle copy!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Great app and super fun. Getting going at first is really slow. But once you have some dragons to alternate, then it gets more exciting!
B007RI56NY|4.0|A band that does keep a hit or two coming through different age groups. The price was very good for this purchase.
034580404X|5.0|These books were extremely entertaining.  I could not put them down, read all three of them in a week!!!  I would recommend these books!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is easy to understand how the Seals are a true brotherhood and America's best. My hope was to read a actual account with no undue influence of politicians. Mission Accomplished.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really loved reading this book! I could not put it down when I started reading it! I have not seen the movie but I hope its just as good!
B009O2XY12|2.0|It started out fun but then when you run out of bubbles you have to buy more to continue to play.  My granddaughter had a good time playing it but who wants to pay to keep playing.  No way
B0011UGLK6|5.0|Great book of short intertwined stories.  I loved it and a fabulous deal for the low price. I will be reading more by this author.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Was not sure about this boxed set then I ordered it, but gave it a try anyway.  It was interesting from the get-go and pulled you in and kept you watching till the last disc!  Gets you going with some love/hate/pity characters and overall is a great break from the lack luster offerings currently on the television.  Great entertainment on a cold winter night when nothing else is happening...make some popcorn and settle in, I think you will be hooked!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't believe I can even begin to sum up how incredible this book is. I feel I truly know Hazel and Augustus. I cried at least once every ten pages, and laughed at least every five. Worth every penny.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Wonderful app for receiving classical music radio stations world wide 24 hours per day; also gives variety of classical music stations available
0345803507|3.0|Just as I noted in the my comment. I read the first book in a matter of days. However, the second and third books...it took me a bit longer.
B005AERS74|5.0|Love Maroon 5! Adam Levine is my favorite judge on the Voice! I started liking Maroon 5 more after watching that show.
0545272629|5.0|My son wanted this book and so we ordered it. The book was in great shape and my son loved it!
B008KW43TE|4.0|The album is great, already knew that from listening to it beforehand.  Normally I get all my music from local stores, but I couldn't pass up the price on Amazon.  I am a little disappointed that you have to download Amazon downloader to retrieve the files and send them to itunes.  It's a little annoying but definitely not a deal breaker.
B0095R64AO|3.0|It was good for the most part but there were some parts that dragged on. I like Jason Segel in this movie but not a far stretch from his other characters.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I bought it for my spouse and he is really pleased with it, all four of my Grandchildren love it too!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I liked it overall but didn't care for kristen Stewart's acting. I could be bias because she cheated on Edward!
B0035YDM9E|4.0|Not a quick read, but a thoughtful well- written one. Makes economics an exciting field, open to various interpretations of available facts. Keynes sure opened the Pandora's box on how governments attempt to corral these economic forces.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This movie was adorable and hilarious. It was a great rental and I am absolutely planning on buying it for myself!
B0058VW36U|5.0|this app is awesome and I play it all the timer I love the little monster is is not scathe at all
B00338QENI|4.0|I remember hearing about HeLa cells in a scientific article about 25-30 years ago.  It was in the context of aging and the life span of cells.  I came away thinking all cancer cells were immortal. When I came across this book I knew the name of Henrietta and was thrilled someone wrote the history of how HeLa came to be.  This story is so much more.  Thank you Rebecca.
B004YRSBTW|4.0|I had last seen this movie when it first came out and decided to see it again after having watched Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy.  The storytelling is still just as interesting the second time around.  Like Mr. Nolan's movie &#34;Inception,&#34; it provokes the viewer to review the storyline and whether things turned out as the movie had unfolded.  Great movie.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|great movie and it is one definitely to get in blu-ray. the detail is so much better in the blu-ray format...worth every penny.
B001992NUQ|5.0|best movie ever though at begining pay attention as while edward norton is tied up on chair, tyler talking.  the camera angle goes down from the top floor of buidling to the car garrage, camera goes Thru the bullet hole of the van window and you can see for a half a second that in fact the bombs timer seconds change(slow down playbak you will notice number are upside down but you can see seconds do change).  forward toward the end of movie when supodily edward norton defuses bomb, tyler durdan kicks him out the van . next take see him looking up from bomb as he was doing something to it. gets out the van standing in front of it while edward norton aims gun at tyler & shoots, bullet goes from vans rear windrow thru front window. tyler breaks van handle bar then beat edward norton till passes out and is sitting tied up on top floor. sooooo bomb got defused by edward norton then tyler turns it back on, and they are on top of building which the bomb is and explodes. everyone dies woooh! unlike the book!
0790731002|3.0|Batman Forever features a solid cast and a semi mediocre plot. Jim Carey does what he can as a villain dressed in a Greenman with black question marks on it costume. Val Kilmer I feel did a descent job as Batman, but unfortunately is not welcomed back for the next one.<br />This is probably one of the better older Batman movies, since it isn't so dark and doesn't include any Arnold Schwarzenegger one liners.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|SAFE HOUSE is a predictable by the book car chase, foot chase action thriller, ably directed and adequately performed.  Denzel Washington brings his usual charm in the role of a rogue CIA agent pursued by the eager young \\"safe housekeeper\\" earnestly played by Ryan Reynolds.  Of course, government corruption and cover-ups are involved.  The identity of the ultimate villain is fairly predictable.  Supporting the two leads are Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard, Ruben Blades and Robert Patrick.<br />At 115 minutes, SAFE HOUSE overstays its welcome but ultimately its an entertaining diversion.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|My family absolutely loves this movie. We wait all year to watch it around Christmas. The quotes, outfits, and overall sarcastic tones make it a hilarious movie. Classic Christmas movie on Blu-Ray for $10, everyone should own it.
B000S5BUXI|5.0|With most things we use or consume, there is a dependable thing. Something trusted and comforting for creatures of habit. Whether it's a favorite pen or movie or place to eat or hiking trail, I think people are not unfamiliar with the idea of something chosen with a higher than normal frequency.<br /><br />This is the album that over the years has strummed its way to the top of my play count list and now is perched comfortably in that slot of trusted music for any mood. It seems to be the one for when I can't figure out what I want to listen to or just when I need to hear it again. I'd estimate that one out of any given three times I play music, I will pick this album or another from the National. Out of the times I pick the National, it's this album over half the time.<br /><br />I didn't fall in love at first listen. It took some time but after a while I realized I would turn on this album and just let it play over and over while I was doing something else. Maybe familiarity breeds affection but the depth and soul of this album make it stand out for me beyond something I simply enjoy and have moved it into its place where I know I can depend on it.
B005LLXB9K|2.0|I must say that this film was an entertaining 2 hours that seemingly flew by. It as well made and interesting and a good watch. It didn't make me like or dislike the band anymore than before. There were 3 things that I remember clearly the next day..... 1) Jeff Ament swears an awful lot, almost every time he's on camera... 2) I almost wish the Mother Love Bone opening was even longer, but mad props to the band for so much Andy Wood love.... 3) I really really disliked how they glossed over the past drummers in an almost disrespectful matter of fact manner. It was done in such an obviously contrived way to make the band bigger and more important that any particular drummer aside from Cameron. All of those guys really helped shape those 90's records in a profound and important way and to almost completely ignore each of them by name just left a bad taste in my mouth. It's not a true documentary by any means and it's clear the band has a lot of control over what made it into the film. Aside from that it was entertaining and something to do for a few hours on a Sunday evening.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Recently bought this movie for my daughters to watch.  We've seen the other Disney Fairies movies and I think this one is the best yet!  It's a very good story about Tinkerbell and her fairy sister, Periwinkle.  My daughters are 5, 3 and 1 - and the older 2 really enjoyed watching this movie.  It kept their attention for the entire time.  Definitely a must see!
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|I am so disappointed with the movie BRAVE. Pixar is not the same after Disney took it over. I thought this was going to be an empowering movie for young girls to see, but it fell super short. Loved the graphics, her dress, hair and that she is a tough girl, but that doesn't mean that she should go on an impulse, that she can't think things through. All I saw was be free, do what makes you feel happy and even after you destroy your family with grief, things will be the way you always intended it to be. BLAH...I think I'm waiting a long long time before I show this to my 3 year old. I don't expect to be able to protect them forever, but I do find that relativism is harder to deal with than any other thing in this world. Do what makes you happy and you can't go wrong!!! BIG NO NO. Do what God would want you to do, even if it's something you don't want to do, bc in the end God knows what is best. I was disappointed in the whole plot. Instead of forcing someone to marry someone (which is true historically, but not really applicable in this age), it could have been a story line like that of the Little Mermaid III, where at first she doesn't understand why her mom would make her do certain things, but then it turns out how mom was right all along. Not go on an impulse without thinking things through (like Tangled, where Rupunzel DID think things through). The 4th king (refering to shakespeare's macbeth) had consequences, but as a girl, everything I (or any girl) will do, will in the end turn out okay no matter what. I'm sorry...I don't mean to be so uptight about this issue, it's just a hard reality check that there are less and less quality movies being made these days.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|cool retro like game, the graphics are really cool and the gameplay is good. get it while it is free.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|The setup for this movie is misleading. You may go into it expecting a Joan of Arc storyline, but you'd be wrong. It's more of a modern tale. That being said, the bears are the best characters by far.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Absolutely love it helps with science and math homework plus with both being advance classes. and teachers are not easy this year with homework so it helps out a lot
B001NKI60W|5.0|Loved this.  What a fun movie.  How can you not<br />love Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan!  The movie<br />kept my interest, moved well.  Christine Baranski<br />was superb!  The young girl who played Sophie was<br />phenomenal - what a voice.  I give Meryl and Pierce<br />a lot of credit for singing.  The end -out takes were<br />great, don't shut it off too soon.  Will buy it next time<br />for sure.
B0038P59A0|3.0|After all the hype surrounding this movie, I finally got around to watching it. After watching, I was happy impressed with the plot twist and the special effects (I really liked the slow motion fight scenes). However, my expectations going in were high, and the movie did not meet those lofty expectations. For example, as a mystery, I found the plot to be rather predictable. It was good, but not good enough that I would want to watch it twice.
B002VXGW2E|3.0|I love all movies Meryl Streep.  She was only in<br />half the movie.  I could have watched Meryl Streep<br />and Stanley Tucci for the whole movie, but they<br />were sandwiched between segments of other actors.<br />A little slow at times.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|A very different take on what Americans believe and why. Although very imaginative in its writing, and expertly written, this book only adds to the milieu of books and movies about thing that Americans seem to be obsessed with, i.e. vampires, ghosts, gods of all varieties, and all of which do not exist. How about a little reality for a change?
B006PTZNSY|5.0|Nicki shows off her great versatile voice. She is sexy, and she has a good selection of tunes-Rap, ballads, hip-hop, etc.<br />Buy it....
B00881PPTO|1.0|A free version, really? Why would they ever make a paid version? Ads on an app that they make money off of already?
B002NS2HBM|5.0|Although it only lasted for five seasons we thought it was very good. It was a great series to watch on the cold winter evenings.
B00A77II0U|5.0|this was a good buy! hours of fun! kinda spooky too!<br />good for younger kids &amp; adults alike. rec reading the strategy guide for assistance replaying the game is also fun as you can switch from casual mode to expert mode.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the series and EL James did a great job tying any loose ends in this book by completing the story in a nice way. I would recommend this book to anyone of my friends, old and young alike, male and female alike. Although most people view this series as a book all about sex, I like to think of it as a love story.<br /><br />I laughed, I cried, I even yelled at a few of the character and received strange looks from my husband! It is a good read and this is coming from a person who rarely takes enough time to read a book, I could not put the books down!
B005IT0V8O|5.0|I have used it for past 35 years.  Always makes a fantastic gift for youngsters. Must have for correct & creative writing.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Best seasonal comedy ever.  Should be added  to annual family tradition that should be viewed once or twice a season
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was shocked at where this book takes you and couldn't stop thinking about it days later!!  It's a must read
B0066WJLU6|4.0|The light works good its nice not having to go into record mode on my cell phone in order to use the light. A few more options would always be nice like possibly and adjustment.
B0086700CM|5.0|love the game cant put it down. if it gets choppy just revolt the kindle and then the game is fine.<br /><br />-
B0058EBNAO|4.0|This weather app has a ton of information which can at times be a little overwhelming although I have not had the app for long and probably will just need more time to get used to it. I also like the additional info the app has on Earthquakes being that I live where that is a factor.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was just like all the Collins books I have read, almost impossible to stop before you are done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sooo much fun. I cant put it down it's so addicting! You will be playing for hours. In other words<br />GET THIS GAME!
B003B02O14|4.0|This book was just like all the Grisham books I have read, almost impossible to stop before you are done.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|My husband watched this movie on tv and wanted me to pick it up for my grandson. My grandson takes it with him when he visits his friends. They BOTH loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just like all the Collins books I have read, almost impossible to stop before you are done.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Ibought this movie and Schindlers List for a teenage grand daughter who is studying about the Haulocaust. Great deal to talk about..
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was just like all the Grisham books I have read, almost impossible to stop before you are done. As you read the book you are confused on what is going on, but at the end you get rewarded as everything fall in to place.
B009A882D0|5.0|I have not had a chance to play any of the CDs but have listened to their records for years.  They are probably other than the Beach Boys my favorite group.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in 2 days! I could not put it down and was upset when it was over because you just want more. I had the book for months before I finally got around to starting it. Defiantly do not overlook this book- it a must read.
0547884591|5.0|I've been a long time reader of Tim's for good reason.  He has a way of cutting through the imposed rules to get at the core of how and why things work, then happily shares these results (failures included) with everyone else (for a nominal fee...who could blame the guy?).<br /><br />His latest book is no different.  I enjoy cooking, but found myself at a loss when I'd follow recipes to the letter and they still wouldn't turn out as expected.  Now, I don't worry about pesky things like measuring cups or the 13 ingredients.  I get to rediscover why certain foods taste well together and how simply those methods can be used for other meals.  These fundamental guidelines make potentially complex meals, simple.<br /><br />It helps that his writing is so conversational, at least to me.  I could see how some could be turned off by such a direct and conversational style, but I appreciate it as it has sort of a \\"I've been there man, don't sweat it\\" vibe.<br /><br />I bought three of Tim's last books (4-Hour Body) to give to friends and can easily see myself doing the same for this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it! It never messes up on me and it's always working! it works perfectly! Never had a glitches in it!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Was great, had the Morrison sound, yet new. Good variety in the different songs, the guy is amazing, love his voice, his sax, his piano, love his sound!
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|Excellent movie - cast perfectly.  Emily Blunt does an outstanding job in this period piece.  Never really new Queen Victoria's story but she obviously led an amazing life.  Definitely a great love story.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was a very well thought out story.  I enjoyed it so much!  I know that some gave it a lower rating because of the back and forth between two different time frames.  I didn't mind that at all because it flowed so well in the progression of the story.  I for one also was so surprised by the ending, never saw that happening.  I'm so glad i scooped this one up!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another entertaining book by John grisham that I was sad to finish reading because it was so good I did not want it end.
B000IZ7YMY|5.0|If you want watch a movie that would let you something more than a good feeling, this may be a good choice
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have wanted to buy this on the computer but never got it.Now I can play it on my kindle fire.Buy this awesome game!It has alot of graphics and is a popular game.But in all minecraft online has more things to craft than minecraft pocket edition.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a must read for skeptics, who better to explore this controversial subject than a respected neurosurgeon?<br />The &#34;other side&#34; is fascinating, audience should keep their minds open while reading.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|I have all of Van's music- and this CD was as expected, Right on the money-Great music and great Mp3 Buy for Amazon<br />Thanks,<br />Billy Boy
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|Fun game for my Grandson and I ..I can use this to keep him entertained while traveling and also challenge him.
B004GJYROG|3.0|the movie was every funny and brings back memories, I used it for the reading mentoring program  for thrid graders.  They saw the DVD and wrote a review ( ALL LIKED IT)
B000G1ALRK|5.0|A must have for Eric Church fans/great tunes I had not heard on the radio  Boots and 2 pink lines are the best
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Good one - back to the old style Grisham I thought... Couldn't put it down - loved the characters, took a few chapters to get into it!!
B008XJM8M8|3.0|Very similar to original re-issue,nothing added or taken away.Same design, almost same sound quality as regular Warner pressings of the last century.Not a bit better.Considering almost $30.00 price tag-does not make it a sensible buy.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|i bought this game because it was on sale but it doesnt even load all the way through.  do not buy until they fix the app
B009GED3HS|5.0|So fast and easy to download episodes and much less hassle than trying to find a trusted website to watch for free.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Everyone loves to throw those little birds at the snotty little pigs.  We love this APP although some of the paid versions are comparable, this is just as good.  The Kids loves it and it looks amazing on the kindle fire.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|This show is the greatest! I don't have cable, and miss watching my favorite shows. On amazon I downloaded the whole season 7 of HIMYM and watched it at my leisure. Love the convenience and no commercials!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided to read this because of the controversy. It seemed that the population was split as to whether it was any good or plain bad.<br />It's poorly written. One can see that from the first page - but even as &#34;soft porn&#34; the male character's sadistic nature and male dominance fetish was too much for me.<br />Frankly it worries me that so many women love this stuff.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have always been a fan of John Grisham and read everything he writes.  This, in my opinion, is one of the BEST if not THE BEST he has ever written!!!!! I was still trying to figure out what was going to happen next right down to the last chapter!  A MUST read.
B00008DDSC|3.0|Interesting story, no enough action. Ending was predictable. I didnt particularly like the role he played. I like him but ive seen better
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Mothership is one of the most amazing CDs I own. It is by far the best collection of Led Zeppelin music in existence. A must have for those new to Led Zeppelin and the veterans.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was hot, hot, hot...didnt want to put it down. Reading the second now and then the 3rd.<br />Its every womans fantasy
0547884591|5.0|I first began following Tim Ferriss after reading The 4-Hour Workweek, which changed my life immensely. I then bought The 4-Hour Body which also changed my, although in different ways. I have only just begun reading The 4-Hour Chef, but I think it is my favorite yet. I highly recommend this book if you want to learn to do ANYTHING. Please keep the books coming Tim!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you don't like Grisham you'll hate this book.<br />It is probably the most Grisham-ish books he's written lately: super high paced, dynamic, a page-turner and with an unexpected end.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I loved this app at first, but now am getting tired of it.  I hate drawing the same things over and over.
159315724X|5.0|I believe the information is very accurate and will help anyone grow, however just like the book says, change is slow and sometimes difficult. I highly recommend this book to anyone with the desire to improve themselves.
B005N7CA3A|5.0|Darren Hayes has an amazing voice range and lyrics that entrap you in his songs<br />Immerse yourself with this talent and you move with the songs<br />One of the best artist in the world.
B007SGM084|5.0|Oh WOW!  I can't say how rivetting this trilogy was!  I couldn't even make myself pause between books.  Since I got all 3 at the same time I just turned the page and started the next book.  I didn't want it to end after the third book.  I miss the characters already.  You go from sobbing in tears to wiggling in your seat to laughing outloud.  I will read this again and it will be better than a favorite old movie.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it was fine no ads nothing bad great for kids I myself love it other people say there's have adult rated ads mine dont
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I bought this watch as an upgrade from countless Timex digitals; it was time to upgrade my look.  I also bought a replacement strap, the [[ASIN:B003UHY61O Speidel Soffice (18mm Regular, Black)]], and the combo looked very sharp, for not too much money.  The watch looks good on small wrists, and isn't too flashy.  The sweep is very cool, and it keeps time relatively well.  Unfortunately, it died after 4 months.  No amount of winding or coddling will bring it back.  Occasionally it'll start moving for a few minutes, but stops shortly thereafter.  Not impressed at all.  It may be inexpensive, but that's no excuse for being cheap.  I would recommend spending more if you want a nice automatic.  This one is attractive at first, but the fun won't last.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This game is surprisingly good. The controls are adjustable and work well. Graphics detail is adjustable and works smoothly at the highest resolution setting on my Acer A100 and A500 tablets. I fly real airplanes and find the detail, response and smoothness really good. Many hours of fun here with several planes to fly and missions to complete.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The title of my review says it all! It has everything that makes a movie great: action, real comedy, suspense. Awesome! I have probably watched this a million times! I am actually watching it right now...
B000NY12LO|5.0|One of Picoult's best novels. Best described are the repercussions of this unbelievable crime on all the families affected by it
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Enjoyed the book because it had different layers to the story.  I like running themes in books where i can become invested in the character so this qualifies plus it goes through emotions and thoughts not just murder and solving the case.  Second one i've read.  will read more.
1439102813|5.0|Phenomenal description of a brilliant woman falling in the clutches of Alzeimer's Disease. One can identify very easily with Alice and her family
1439152802|5.0|I like a unpredictable book - which this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />You will never guess the end - would definitely recommend to a friend.
B005K2XM94|5.0|Needed a case for our Nexus 7, and a friend with both a Kindle & Nexus 7 recommended this one.  So just in case you were wondering, yes it fits the Nexus 7.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|This movie was such a surprise!  I didn't know much about it before I saw it.  I loved the star of the movie.  A few of my coworkers did not like the movie.  But I took the movie to be fictional and a fun movie to watch.  I  will watch it again.  I have already recommended it to other friends.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Don't like that the app never closes out. Doesn't feel secure at all. Also don't like the interface. Will not be using it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Only a few stories show up on timeline. I've used the FB app on several other devices and this is by far the worst version. I love the kindle and all the features but not the FB app.
B00881PPTO|1.0|As I said,  Amazon needs to review its app reviw process. KP is much too intrusive.  I would suggest that Amazon do the right thing and start a simple rating system for intrusiveness so that people who value their privacy could quickly avoid intrusive apps like KP.  Also,  rebranding a free app for giveaway dilutes Amazons credibillity.  Amazons reputation has suffered with this incident.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This was one of the funniest episodes. It seemed like the writers got back to basics with there writing. Inward laughing till I was in tears.
B005HFUQAM|5.0|I absolutely love this album, can listen to it over and over when I am driving. My car even loves this album.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Lee Child must have been in a hurry when he wrote this latest Jack Reacher novel; it does not measure up in any way to the best works in this series.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|The app works extremely well. There is one thing that I would prefer not to happen is that what you compose and want to print has to go to servers in Cloud and then print. It says it is deleted as soon as you print. Had it not been for this one thing I would have rated it five stars.
B00634GHJA|1.0|This app worked great in the beginning, but now won't connect to my home PC. I've been in contact with the developer, and received no resolution to the problem. My last few contacts got no reply.  Uninstalling today.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was well written and hard to put down.  I tried the sample on my Kindle and it hooked me right away.<br />It is interesting the dance these two characters play and it makes you think about what you would do in these situations.  Would you give up and walk away from someone you are overwhelmingly attracted to just because they have demons in their closet?<br />I couldnt put the book down and this is coming from someone who doesnt easily jump on the bandwagon.  If you like emotional books that make you question things, you will enjoy this book.  If you dont like going out of your comfort zone (or care for erotic scenes), then dont go here.<br />Im half way through book 2 and its just as good as the first.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|I liked it and all the twists. Hopefully they will have an inception 2, there are so many places they can go with this.
B007N0AEWY|5.0|Got turned on to this disc by hearing &#34;Say I Wanna Know&#34; on a TV commercial. It stood out and I knew I wanted to check out the rest of the album. Music seems to all sound the same (to me) these days but this is different.  Some might call it &#34;retro&#34;, kind of rat pack 60's cool, I just call it good music and honestly a welcome change.  Great songs sung by a talented singer, backed up obviously by fine musicians.  Give it a listen.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|This is a terrific jacket.  It has a back flap that opens just enough to slide the cover in place and \\"tripod\\"it to read.  Also just today I dropped it on a metal surface and the jacket totally protected it from harm.
B005G26NJE|5.0|Seems like the music scene has been starving for real talent these days.  You could listen to all of the auto-tuned/pitch corrected drivel out there if you are willing to settle for sub-par schlock.  I am not.  It's nice when someone with obvious talent and soul comes along.  It's also nice that there has been a bit of a blues revival going on lately.  I'm a big fan of The Black Keys (mostly their stuff prior to &#34;Brothers&#34;) and some of Gary Clark Jr's bluesier stuff runs in that vein (&#34;Bright Lights&#34;, &#34;Don't Owe You a Thang&#34; or &#34;When My Train Pulls In&#34;). But he also show his range with a song like &#34;Things Are Changin'&#34; where he branches off into soul (think John Legend).  I am glad he can span quite a few genres.  I have not even mentioned his guitar virtuosity.  Being a (mediocre) guitarist myself I can listen to his playing over and over and it never gets stale.  Especially the last two songs on this EP where it is just Gary and a guitar, nothing else.  It's music stripped down to its essence and it sounds amazing.  When you can listen to a singer and a single instument and feel like nothing is missing you know you are dealing with a real talent.  This is great music.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm not one to get into watching TV series, but The Walking Dead sucked me right in! i LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Our family started watching it on AMC when it started and my boyfriend and I have caught up to them in the last month by watching on Netflix/Amazon. If you don't watch it already, we highly recommend it!
B004QDCZ3M|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album. The title says it all...Her vocals shows that she is using her &#34;lungs&#34; to their fullest capacity. The arrangements are lush and create a dark and sensuous landscape. I have the deluxe version, I would suggest getting it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it helps to keep my mind thinking unlike some games.  It is a lil challenging but fun!!!
B0088TG252|5.0|Acting is an A+ in this Action Thriller! Great soundtrack and phenomenal cinametography! Highly recommend, as I would most all of Denzel's films!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Hard to beat this classic with Jodie Foster in the lead - wonderful film!!  Most highly recommended for all ages.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I love all things Potter, so I couldn't wait to get my movie. I didn't have long to wait, because it can in a week. I love Amazon.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|A couple songs in there are kinda boring, but most of them are fantastic. It definitely leaves me wanting more.
B008J34466|5.0|Don't let the Katy Perry style of  &#34;Blow Me One Last Kiss&#34; turn you off. This is by far one of her best projects.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have always loved Ken Follett and this book reinforces why.  His writing skills and research capasity gives such an awesome finished product.  I downloaded Winter World and am sucked in deeply.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Does what it says, my only issue is that its in the way when start the phone sometimes and you have to minimize it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is AWSEOME!!I got it when I saw a lot of people playing I got it a week before the riendeer dragon came out
B007EECSFA|5.0|Twists and turns, overlaped by history and fiction, make for an engaging read.  Characters that will alternately elisit ire then sympathy will propel you forward on this rolercoaster of a story, with a safe and happy landing at the end of the ride.
1419705849|5.0|My boys have both read this entire series.  They both love these books.  This book was sold at the book fair at my boys school, but it was more expensive and it was a paperback.  This is a great value for a hardback!
B007SGM084|5.0|Ladies, sit back, relax and take a journey with E.L. James. High, high in the star-filled sky, a dream shines just for you. Mr. James, you have manage to capture the true essence of my current relationship. We was never able to put into words, what we felt for each other. This journey have allowed me to identify this thing that have been envolving in my current relationship (not the Dom and Sub). The little things that we do - pick up the phone to call each other at the exact same time (all the time) and our friends think we are weird. I know and feel the passion between your characters. i am just finishing the second book and i know i will enjoy the final book in the trilogy. From all the women across the world - THANK YOU!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think its a great game.  I love hidden object games and wish there were more of them but realize they take time to create
B00493E1GI|4.0|I really liked this movie. It is inspiring to anyone who may be going through life changes such as a breakup or divorce.<br />If you liked Under the Tuscan Sun, you may like this movie.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Cut the rope is so fun and it keeps you entertained. I love this game it is so fun. I love it.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This movie is funny. It made fun of the 80s music industry. Great looking cast. Russell and Alec were hilarious. I don't like Tom Cruise in a serious roll but he was a great in this movie.
B004FP1WX0|3.0|Very interesting if you like to watch how people can be basic mental cases and create elaborate psychopathic behaviors. Good Movie
B005LAIIS0|1.0|Give an award to the trailer editors for splicing together something from their imagination that held no reality to the film's true nature or theme. From the beginning moments to the closing scene, the entire movie is about death. And while there's nothing wrong with movies that deal with this important topic, this film was devoid of all deeper meaning or greater perspective. It fell from gray to a depressing shade of black. Then, as if it hadn't already overdosed on it's loathing of life, it felt the need to inject lethal doses of human depravity, over-the-top violence, unrealistic fight-against-nature sequences, and a script that could have been written by troubled middle schoolers (trying to outdo each other with how many f-bombs they can squeeze into each phrase).<br /><br />Philosophical depth? No. Just a look at fatalism from a cold, shallow perspective.<br /><br />What wasted opportunities -- for this film, a great actor, and my evening.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|its ok its not like its the treatise game in the world and you can play this on facebook it is the same thing
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game is so fun and really reminds you of Star Wars. All the characters make it fun with everything they do.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Outstanding story development, Great acting, Great Screenplay, Great directing and it is more than what anyone could ask for in a televised show about a hero. The first season had me hooked. I recommend this show for people who like supernatural adventures even though this show isn't quite supernatural, but more on a crime scene type of show. It has some originality.
034580404X|3.0|This is clearly one story broken into three books for financial gain. One book does not stand alone without the others. Like buying a music album with only one good song. The story and characters are fun, in a high school sort of way. It is not at all as kinky and nasty as I heard. I liked it well enough, but feel ripped off. I recommend it to read, but not to buy. Sorry Amazon.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Their best yet. Shinedown does no wrong. They are truly one of the most talented groups on radio today. Amazing
0547884591|5.0|I started following Tim Ferriss in 2007 and have read virtually everything he's written since. His writing have seriously changed the way I look at things and have helped me become more knowledgable and effeicent in how I do things. In fact, he probably deservs a lot of credit for what I am professionally as many of the skills from the 4HWW are processes I've implimented to do much more than I could have otherwise.<br />The main reason I purchased this book was not because I wanted to learn how to become a chef or anything like that, rather I knew if Tim had a part in it, it would be great. So far (160 pages in), the book has surpassed what I could have expected. All the wisdom the book has aside, I have changed a couple of things in my diet and just how I do things day-to-day and feel great as a result. I am only about 160 pages into the book and have just got into a couple of the recipes but can see myself cooking a lot more simply because he makes previously intimidating things seem so easy. Tim simplifies things so even beginners won't be intimidated and the simple ingerdents list along with his flavor pairing explanations brings even a total beginner (like myself) up to speed pretty quickly. My first meal, the Osso Buko was the best meals I've eaten in months and this is coming from someone who frequests high-end steak houses regualrily. I've skipped ahead to some other pages I knew I would find interesting and am really looking forward to \\"continuing the adventure.\\" Buy this book, I promise you won't regret it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book rocks, loved it cover to cover even though I had already seen the tv show- which is also great and arguably better.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It's a real bargain for a long micro usb cable. I use it for my 2 Kindles and smart phone.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Another instant classic for Dylan. A coworker suggested it to me, and I watched the video for Duquesne Whistle, and decided to get the album. I had to listen to it a few times, but there are some instant classics on this album. Tempest, Roll On John, Duquesne Whistle, many others. Buy it! You won't be disappointed.
B003K1EYM6|2.0|The adaptor worked well with various camera SD cards with JPEG, video and RAW (Canon EOS60D).<br />Used it with an iPad 3.<br />The SD card reader has now just died for no reason and the supplier won't replace it, so $30 for 7 months!<br />Need to think hard about replacing it.
B0012GMVXU|5.0|Great album. Had the CD years ago and it got lost. I get in the Cohen mood from time to time, so I decided to invest again. Glad I did. Great album--especially for road trips to see family & friends.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great layered sounds for falling asleep. I layer 10 sounds together - no problems with skips- plug in my Kindle Fire, and it plays all night. Plus, I can play background noise when I read an ebook in a noisy place.
0062215507|5.0|Bought this because when I went to buy the last one, it was completely sold out.<br /><br />It is great and I can't really tell you the differences between this one and the old one.<br /><br />Great gift for HP fan!
0142403873|5.0|great book.  it is a bed time favorite and it is a very easy read!  We first got the DVD, and decided to get the book too for bedtime stories.  wonderful purchase-- one of our favorite books.
B0086900TI|5.0|Although this movie resonated in part because I am a retired teacher, it was rec. by my 26 year old son. Layered with complexity and inevitable contradiction, it was well worth a second viewing. I certainly was deaf to its existence until my son saw it on Showtime. Why no buzz? It is an excellent film.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My husband found this DVD in the bargain bin at a local grocery store one day. It is the cutest little story- our 2 year old LOVES the Gruffalo!  We even got the book to read too.  It is now our favorite go-to gift for little friends.<br />The music is nice, the narration is calming and quiet....your little one will enjoy!
B003TT2X72|5.0|[spanish]<br />Una excelente pelicula, las 3 horas se pasan volando, ademas de una excelsa banda sonora.<br />Efectos digitales realmente sorprendentes y una actuacion solida (en especial de Ian McKellen, como el poderoso mago Gandalf)<br />[/spanish]
0547884591|5.0|I received my book 2 days before I was expecting it, thanks Amazon!  I really like the book. I already tried a recipe,<br />Salt-Baked Sweet potatoes- 4-Hour Chef, page 340 it was easy & fun to prepare and Delicious.  I'll definitely be cooking & following the curriculum of DOM!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I did things backwards and saw the movie before reading the book. As usual, the book is better than the movie! Specifically details of the book that were left out that make the book that much better. A must read!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Jeeves and Wooster is an excellent series that uses intelligent humor. Wooster is a delightful fellow and Jeeves is his Valet. Together they make an unbeatable team. Wish the show had 10 seasons.
0425263916|3.0|I am so torn with this book.  I love the Gideon & Eva story, yet this book did not live up to the expectation I had after reading BTY.  They came across as too needy and desperate than the smoldering desirous characters we first met. Overall, I enjoy the story and can't wait for it to continue, hopefully without all the desperation.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a christmas gift so I don't know much about this show, was on his list to get for christmas
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had a problem with the kindle wire that came with my kindle.  Amazon sent me this one right away and took care of the issue.  The old one would not sync with my laptop, but it did charge.  Great response, Amazon!
0446580848|2.0|The Panther is a major disappointment from an author who has produced classics like Plum Island and The Lion.  Honestly, I've only read about a third of the book, having put it aside with the intention of giving it another try.  It reads like a spy thriller written by Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.  Are they paying DeMille by the word now?  The book is at least twice as long as it needs to be.  Also, it seems to be an inferior copy of The Lion's Game or The Lion with Corey now hunting an American-born terrorist in Yemen.  His description of life in Yemen (to the extent that it's accurate) is fairly interesting.  The problem is that I'm somewhere around page 200, and nothing exciting has happened yet.  Corey, who used to be an amusing wiseacre, has become a cynical, distrustful know-it-all who voices every single thought, no matter how mundane.  His wife is just as bad so the reader finds himself mired in long, boring conversations about nothing.  Most of the jokes fall flat, and the story gets bogged down in the logistical minutiae of hunting terrorists.  Get on with the story, for Pete's sake!
034580404X|5.0|I waited to buy this when the three book collection came out.  Glad I did.  I went from one book to the other quickly.  A total guilty pleasure.
0385535147|4.0|I would put The Racketeer in the top third of all his books.  Not as good as The Firm or The Client, but far better than cynical efforts like The Brethren or The Summons.  Another good thing about this book is that Grisham has stepped down from his soapbox (see The innocent Man or The Confession) to tell an engaging story.  The best thing about this book is the protagonist Malcolm Bannister, a small-town Black lawyer unfairly imprisoned for alleged RICO violations, who devises a clever scheme to secure his release.  Bannister is a likable character who you can't help rooting for.  Grisham employs his typically breezy style to tell a briskly-paced tale with just enough sardonic humor to lighten things up.  More than likely, you'll find yourself reading this in a few sittings--the perfect book for the beach or a plane flight when great concentration is not necessary.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I love the tenth Doctor and David Tennant and this screwdriver. The screwdriver is great and easy to hold out in front of myself like a nerd. It also sufficiently unnerves my cat.
0393343405|3.0|I picked up this book because of its accolades - Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner, among others - and because I thought it would be about what its title and subtitle indicate: \\"the swerve\\" of human history, or \\"how the world became modern\\", a study of how western civilization emerged from the Dark Ages.  In the preface, the author speaks of the \\"epochal change\\" wrought by Lucretius, yet I conclude after finishing The Swerve that Lucretius should be credited with only a minuscule effect on bringing about the Enlightenment.<br />  The Swerve's first nine chapters are mainly a speculative and I thought boring account of the life of Poggio, who first copied Lucretius's De Rerum Natura.  Chapter 8 stands out, though, in providing a comprehensive summary of De Rerum Natura.  Here Lucretius's philosophical points are finally summarized.  I would have liked the author to have presented this information earlier, and to have expanded this chapter to cite examples of influences Lucretius had on the history of ideas.  Alas, this summary stands alone, without much development of the effects of Lucretius's ideas on the history of science and philosophy, beyond the suggestion that Lucretius was one of many voices talking about the inherent materialism of the physical universe.<br />  The Swerve's last two chapters begin to address the influence of Lucretius's ideas on modern thought, but the author's thesis is somewhat undermined by his statement, just ten pages form the end, when he writes \\"...the poem's circulation was limited to a relatively small, elite group.\\"  The author had just a few pages before asserted \\"...the recovery and recirculation of Lucretius's On the Nature of Things had succeeded in linking the very idea of atoms, as the ultimate substrate of all that exists, with a host of other, dangerous claims.\\"  The linking of this idea with other claims is suggested but not developed or described.  The author writes \\"Lucretius saw the universe as a constant, intensely erotic hymn to Venus.\\"  Unfortunately, The Swerve does not develop how Lucretius's  \\"hymn\\" opened minds to science and rationalism.  The Swerve does not offer many specific examples of how and why Europe emerged from the Dark Ages; nor does the book does discuss the relative influence De Rerum Natura has had in the complex mosaic of philosophy and the history of the Enlightenment.  Five pages from the end the author writes \\"Lucretius' materialism helped to generate and support the skepticism of the likes of Dryden and Voltaire and the programmatic, devastating disbelief expressed in Diderot, Hume, and many other Enlightenment figures.\\"  The Swerve does not show how this skepticism developed, nor does the author explain the significance of the philosophers he just named.  The author states \\"Lucretius helped to shape Jefferson's confidence that ignorance and fear were not necessary components of human existence.\\"  This assertion stands alone and unsubstantiated, begging to be developed.intensely erotic hymn to Venus.\\"  Unfortunately, The Swerve does not develop how Lucretius's  \\"hymn\\" opened minds to science and rationalism.

B000FA5SMK|2.0|The story was ok. Overkill on the NY macho attitude. Not sure if I'll buy another DeMille book. I normally like murder mysteries but this one was too simplistic in the writing style.

0345803485|5.0|I absolutely love these books.  I will be reading them again and again.  I have several friends who have read these and love them as well.
B0012FE3BE|4.0|Let's cut to the chase...Sweet Jane and Rock and Roll are two of the greatest, most memorable rocks songs, period.  The only reason kids don't play these riffs on Guitar Hero or Rock Band is because, well, it's Lou Reed...the guy who also writes weird songs about aging actresses, lonesome cowboys, the addicted, the perverse, etc.<br /><br />Still, Rock and Roll has a darn near perfect guitar progression, and Lou's penchant for pretty 60's pop arrangements, and right turn, 'pull the rug out from under your feet' intros and mid song switcheroos really shine on Loaded.  While there is no Pale Blue Eyes, the album stays strong through Cool it Down (A side), and offers a couple gems via a train ride, and a homage to holding your head high.<br /><br />In short, a classic.  This stuff was the Lou Reed source fuel used for his 70's run, amping up the sound, and singing about wanting to be black.  Here, he's actually doing it.
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely love these books.  I will be reading them again and again.  I have several friends who have read these and love them as well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Filmed with such beautiful expertise, Downton Abbey is a wonderful revelation. The characters are multi-faceted and complex which drives the series forward. Here is a perfect example of screenwriting at its best with its witty dialogue and interesting plots all written by Julian Fellowes. The chemistry between Dan Stevens' Matthew Crawely and Michelle Dockery's Mary Crawley is so palpable and visceral that compels viewers to watch every rise and downfall in their relationship. Maggie Smith as the Countess couldn't be any better with excellent comedic delivery and charm that lightens the mood of the gloomy atmosphere set during World War I. I recommend this brilliant series strongly and say set aside a week of your time to breeze by two whole seasons without any regret.

0307592731|3.0|Good for your price.  Nice hard cover.  Great read.  Smaller print however so may be hard to read for someone with vision problems.
0307744434|5.0|Being a fan of the Harry Potter novels, I went into this worried that I would find myself feeling that something was missing. A book about magic and not involving house elves? However, I devoured this book. It has a nice love tale captured within it, and gives the reader much to create in their mind. The imagery is phenomenal. I truly loved this book, and am very glad that I took the risk in purchasing it.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|solves the problem of having the bose speakers that can't connect with anything beyond apple, this cables enables the connection with multiple devices and I use to listen to pandora that is streaming from my cell phone or tablet.<br />Great stuff!
B003VANOFY|3.0|The actual hardware for the headset is very nice.  It's comfortable to wear, feels sturdy, holds a decent charge, and sounds good.  Hardware alone gets 5 stars easily.<br /><br />The drivers, on the other hand, are terrible.  The current Logitech driver (downloaded Mon, Nov 26th 2012) does not even recognize the headset on Windows 7 or 8, which means it still works as a headset, but none of the extra buttons or settings are available (including 7.1 surround sound).  There is an OLD edition of the drivers that you can find online in forum links that at least recognizes the device, but it's utterly unacceptable that the current up-to-date drivers fail to recognize the headset.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Such a wonderful book series. It caught my attention instantly and I could not put the book down. Read through the series and I was ready to start it over again by the time I was done.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|There is nothing missing from this set! I was a bit hesitant on getting this set as it basically gave the same \\"inclusions\\" of my \\"Quadrilogy\\" set. I was in for a BIG surprise. The mere fact that dual layer blus ray discs are used in containing all the info of not just the \\"Quadrilogy\\" set, but every set I have owned! Plus the added \\"MU-TH-UR\\" Mode which basically takes you to all the extra scenes not available on \\"Quadrilogy\\" such as many \\"ad libbed\\" scenes between Yafet Kotto & Harry Dean Stanton in \\"Alien\\". The quality is unsurpassed (so far)! I actually like all 4 movies being so different and never boring!<br /><br />If you are an Alien fan like myself, you will LOVE this set! The packaging is a bit of a pain. Remember that blu ray discs are more durable and less apt to be scratched. Even with the glossy slip sleeves included to make the set as compact as possible. If they were DVD's, they couldn't handle these sleeves. The only set back is getting the inner \\"book of discs\\" in the main box is a pain to get out and in due to a ledge on the book that holds the discs. This is a minor problem and does ruin the discs as they sit safely in place. I am sure in time, the ledge will get damaged but when I watch the novies, I just keep the book out of the box housing. All in all, this is a great set and I got it at an incredible price through Amazon! Amazon is simply the best!
B003B02PFO|4.0|Fun and cheerful, but not Grisham's best.. It feels a bit like reading a sitcom. However, I did enjoy it, had a good time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love it when I can pick up a book & with in the first chapter you are hooked. I couldn't put it down, the chapters all run together because you just keep flipping pages<br />The only bad thing is when it comes to an end & you have to go back to real life. Great book!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|lot of fun when your bored , realy addicting. my wife had it on her Kindle Fire first I had to get it on mine
B009VB97EY|3.0|Ok so Channing Tatum is HOT! Yes we know this. The dancing was great who doesn't like to watch a good strip show. But that was just it. The story line to me was dry there was no substance to this movie except for watching guys dancing around stripping. Which I do like eye candy so that is the only reason why I gave this 3 stars just because Channing Tatum is a great dancer in this movie but I look at him differently other than a stripper.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I could not into this movie even my mom got up and left the room. I tried again before my 24 hr limit was up but it still did not capture me although I love Johnny Depp. I just could not watch this movie. Maybe I will give it another try sometime.
0394827996|5.0|I found this book very useful into my work with people... it helps to see how our mind works and how the interpretation of the reality is based in our preconceptions or the way we see the world. It invites to be open mind. Additionally, it helps to reflect on our acceptation of our reality.
0525952926|5.0|I found myself putting it down occasionally so It would last longer.....cannot wait for the third book in the trilogy.
1439153663|2.0|It was a long drawn out soap opera.  Also being narrated by the two main characters is unlikely unless they are among the few people in the entire world who are known to have total recall of everything they have said or done.  It was not stated that this was the case.  Did have some nice insights  regarding customs and styles of the period but that was not enough for me to recommend the book to others.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I like well written novels.  This is interesting and different, but very slow for me.  I am almost half way through it and I put it down for a while.  I don't do that with books that move well.  It has wonderful reviews and is a best seller, so I will plod through it later, but don't expect excitement.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|I expected to like \\"Cloud Atlas,\\" but I didn't think that I'd be totally blown away. It left me with that awe-inspiring, spectacular feeling I used to get when I was a kid and I came out of one of those jaw-dropping cinematic masterpieces like \\"2001.\\" This is thrilling, breathtaking, original film-making, full of unexpected turns and twists, and, yes, very challenging to take in. I plan to see it again AFTER I read the novel. One can easily see why it required three directors. Oddly enough, most of the packed house I saw it with were there because \\"Lincoln\\" was sold-out, so \\"Cloud Atlas\\" was their next option. But at the end of the two hours and forty-four minutes, they gave the movie a standing ovation, stayed right through the end credits, and couldn't stop talking about it on the way out. Now THAT'S a movie!<br /><br />The \\"Cloud Atlas\\" box-office take was not helped by nit-picking critics. Yes, there were a couple of things that I might have changed, but they were tiny, and can be found in any and every great film. And every artistic work is the vision of the director(s), so it's not our place to judge what they chose to do. I am positive that time will be a great friend to this movie, and it will gain more and more appreciation as the years go by. Let us remember that \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" were slammed by critics when they first opened, and now are revered to the heavens.
B003647BNQ|4.0|Like most movie soundtracks, the Zhivago CD lacks something without the movie, still it's wonderful music... reminiscent of the epic motion pictures of the past.  My only hestitation in granting this 5-stars is the unexpected variations of Lara's Theme that come out of nowhere at the end.  There's the Jazz, Rock and Swing versions.  Seriously?  This, I admite, is a matter of personal taste (not mine, but perhaps yours), and ultimately does not detract from the wonderful music preceeding.  Nevertheless I found it a strange way to end an otherwise exemplary soundtrack.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Love this movie! It keeps my daughter entertained for hours, she never gets tired of watching this. Would recommend to others, yes :-)
B009AZZEU2|4.0|When Soundgarden announced their retirement in the late 90's, I was hit hard by the news that would tear apart my favorite band. Now 15 years later, original members;Chris Cornell, Kim Thayil, Ben Sheppard and Matt Cameron, who is also been the drummer for Pearl Jam the last decade. They're back and with what I would say the best rock album of the last few years. This is the Soungarden sound we all loved and now its back, and the band hasn't missed a beat.<br />For the children of the 90's, it doesn't get any better than this.
B004XN3FHA|1.0|Loved it at first, but just as others noted, the cheap push button switches stopped working after a short time.  Usually only 2 of 4 settings function, and of course they are not the brightest settings.  Would not recommend.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|My wife wanted to rent this film since she had heard nothing but good things about it. Once we were done watching it, I wanted the two hours of my life back. No realy plot, a lot of bare butts of the guys, plently of simulated sex acts on the stage.<br /><br />What is film making coming too?
1423113454|5.0|I was introduced to Mr Riordan's works by my teenage cousin who wanted me to read the Percy Jackson series with her. I was instantly hooked to the series. I am a sucker for anything historical/mythological related.<br /><br />I began to search for other books written by Mr Riordan.<br />I came across the Kane Chronicles.<br /><br />The dynamic relationship between Carter and Sadie reminds of my own relationship with my sibling. The sarcasm. The mutual understanding that we can pick on each other however we want, but if an outsider tries to pick on either one of us, then they've another thing coming...<br /><br />I felt like I was on the adventure with Carter and Saide. IE: when the Kanes went up against Desjardins and other members from the House of Life, etc. Yes, the descriptive was that good.<br /><br />Mr Riordan achieved what a book is supposed to do:<br /><br />-Be well written<br />-At a pace where it keeps the reader's interest<br />-Develop characters that the readers actually care about or love to hate<br />-Carry you away to another place while reading<br /><br />I look forward to finishing the other two Kane books and moving onto The Heroes of Olympus.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|I enjoyed the humor, and interplay of the previious superhero movies, Capitan American, Ironman, Thor but the film itself drug out much too long. The closing fight sequence seemed like it would never end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the BEST show ever!!!!!! Gory, but so intense. The acting in this is awesome!!! Watch it and you won't be disappointed!!!!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|The protagonist of this who-dun-it is quirky, to say the least. A body mutilated by cutting words into it, everywhere.  Really!  Unfortunately, I could not find her deserving of my sympathy, and the rest of the cast was less interesting.  Notwithstanding a lot of bodies not much happens. I give the author a solid mark for originality, but at the end, it did not seem worth it.
B0042KA5EK|2.0|I wanted to give this show a shot, I thought it could be good. But it's too dramatic, to the point of being ridiculous. And the acting really isn't all that great.
B007KOLNXC|2.0|Given I have plus (which I am not sure what i really get in the way of videos from having plus), the cost of a single episode or a series seems way too high.  Especially the added cost for HD.  The rating reflects the price, not the high quality of the Mad Men series.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|If you're the type to enjoy a good puzzle game then this is probably a good one for you to try out. I like it for the most part but I found it didn't hold my interest for very long and hardly ever play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the story, fell in love with the characters, it's no nobel prize literature, however it is a cannot put down read.  Also loved the following two books.
B003G94BZC|4.0|The only thing keeping me from giving this show five stars is the eleventh Doctor. Unlike so many people out there now a days, I am not a fan of Eleventh. I miss Tenth!
B002BSHXJA|4.0|a very good upgrade on the previous Beatles CDs issued in the 80's  Stereo best for some titles - and mono for others.  Not a Beatles fanatic - but just good to have for a music lover
B005LF9OCE|5.0|When I caught up through season six of HIMYM on Netflix I knew I couldn't wait until they got season 7 to watch more! Thankfully netflix had them all and I was able to buy the whole season!
B007L6VR12|5.0|I've always been a fan of Wes Anderson's movies, but Moonrise Kingdom really pulls all the elements together -- the quirky characters, the offbeat humor, the fascination with dysfunctional family dynamics -- and adds an extra dose of sweetness and optimism about the human capacity for love. It's also gorgeous to look at and has a great soundtrack. Superb!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Beautifully written in clear, simple but dense prose. The journey sums up not just Harold's life but most people's lives from the beauty of nature, ideals and innocent faith to the harsh reality of materialism and broken dreams. But it is a tribute to the unfailing human spirit that some good is always squeezed out of any situation.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|ehh it just okay, not as good as the first three but if you like the series then you have to read it
B00917IQFY|4.0|Besides the obvious joy at hearing GP & The Rumour play together again, this is GP's best writing and music in far too long. As far as I was considered, his last two &#34;albums&#34; were the the weakest of his career. I could only bear to listem to them twice. The only reason this album doesn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't have enough rock & soul and is too short...give us MORE, guys!!!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|well written and excellent book it is deffinetly some thing new to the read, i give it a thumbs up.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I was SO afraid this album would be tripe like the last one, 'Keep It Simple', which was one of the three worst albums of his career (sacrilege time; the other two are 'Astral Weeks' & 'Veedon Fleece'). For the first time in a long time there's not a weak track to be found. So good to hear he's got his muse and mojo back together. What you got next for us, Van?
B000FBFN1U|4.0|this is well written and detailed book, it is definetly something new to read, i give it a thumbs up.

0446567337|4.0|A classic Nicholas Sparks novel! Super sweet and a little predictable.  I definitely like that it is written in a modern time and mentions world events that I have experienced in my life.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you have never seen a Wes Anderson film before, you might not like this movie. His films are always off-kilter and have interesting, strange characters and plots.<br /><br />Excellent visually and the score is great. Bruce Willis is fantastic.
0425263908|5.0|Yes, this is one of those raunchy lady-porn novels... but if you love those books (like me) then it's a must read!
1401227821|5.0|Bought this as a present for my boyfriend who loves Hughes work. Very satisfied with the contents. Lots of pictures of Wonder Woman.
0425263916|3.0|I didn't like Reflected in You as much as Bared to You, as it gets even more ridiculous, but it's still a good read.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I picked up the Night Circus because everyone was talking about it - it's also on a ton of Book Club lists.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the story and characters, but the ending is a little disappointing and happens pretty fast.
B003JA5NVE|5.0|This may be my all time favorite show... scratch that. This IS my all time favorite show!  The dialogue is hilarious and the relationships are so intriguing!
B005VPRETE|5.0|This is the third set that she has in the series.  Her and I have fun putting them together and then playing with it.
0385342047|3.0|By book 6, I think we're stretching the series pretty far. However, I'm addicted to following a series through the end.  It's a cute addition to the Shopaholic story.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The graphics is awesome! Levels of play are intriguing. Most definitely.  . .addicting. My husband and I are in competition with this game. ALOT OF FUN. I like it better than Space one. It is as much fun as original and we also like Seasons.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it its super fun and I play it all the time you should get because its free and fun.
0345529057|5.0|A complicated plot that is not about the characters that you think it is about. A great series that I have read multiple times! Highly recommended!
0060873175|2.0|One of the keys to reading Michael Crichton is understanding that he is not really a great writer.  He is an idea guy, and if the idea is catchy, the book is successful.  (He is not alone in this; Dan Brown (as just one example) also gets by based on his ideas, not his sparkling words.)  Earlier Michael Crichton works (up to Jurassic Park or thereabouts) tended to be better written; his later books - including the topic of this review, Micro - are more deficient.<br /><br />The concept of Micro focuses on a Hawaiian-based technology company that has come up with a device that can shrink objects to a one-hundreth of their normal size (other fractions are also possible).  Unfortunately, the guy who runs the company is your standard evil CEO who tricks several college students (brought to the company on a recruiting trip) into being shrunk to around half-an-inch tall after they learn of his dastardly doings.<br /><br />Because he apparently got all his evil ideas out of the Evil CEO Handbook, he knows he can't just step on them and be done with it; no, he has to expose them to traps and perils instead.  Eventually, the students will wind up on a nature preserve that is loaded with deady creepy crawlies, many of which intend to make the students their next meal.  Can they get their size restored before they succumb either to nature or the \\"micro-bends\\" that afflict the dimensionally-altered?<br /><br />You may note I really don't discuss the individual students, because they are - like most Crichton characters - rather flat and often stereotypical, none more so than a whiny know-it-all who will be a danger to others even as he pontificates psuedo-intellectually.  Often times, the characters merely exist as talking heads, designed to provide exposition (this is, not as bad as in some Crichton books, possibly because of co-author Richard Preston, who apparently finished the book after Crichton's death).<br /><br />So with the weak characters and the plot just passable, itfalls on the idea to make the book good, and here again there is failure.  This is essentially a darker reworking of the Disney movie, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, with a bit of Dr. Cyclops mixed in.  The flaws of shrinking people can be glossed over in tales of light fantasy, but in what is supposed to be plausible science fiction, the problems are more glaring, dismissed by little more than hand-waving.  Crichton (and Preston) may have enough skill to make this better than one-star material, but this is still a skippable book.
B0088X7YMS|4.0|If you are a SST fan then this is for you. Lots of blasting away at hordes of bugs. Introduction of several new kinds of bugs and a high body count. I am trying to avoid spoilers. Some CG nudity, lots of language and tons and tons of violence. For all that it is a little depressing and the story sort of lagged in places. The artwork is AWESOME!
B008NEMPTO|5.0|I was particularly impressed with Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter(Blu-ray 3D) because of its faithfulness to the book,impressive actors and script,outstanding costuming, and sets and 3D effects that were out of this world.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Great movie with the heart of Christmas intact. Good story, cute characters and someone to save the spirit of Christmas
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next book to com out. Ir u liked Fifty Shades u should def read this book!!!!! I love you Gideon!

B0093OGBL6|5.0|It's a good book and I was pleased to be interviewed by Ms. Moriarty and included in the book. I believe it's a good vehicle to advance Michael's positive reputation.  I worked for Michael, visited Neverland and mkade a documentary about Neverland called \\"Michael Jackson: The Untold Story of Neverland\\".  It's here on Amazon.  Anyway, good job Karen!<br /><br />Larry Nimmer
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|It is another great movie by Pixar and Disney. Something the whole family will enjoy. Excellent voice cast for this film.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I first watched this movie as a kid with my Father.  And to this day (25 years later) is still in my top 3 movies of all time.  Its got Action Adventure Romance Heroisim Tragedy Blood Sweat tears and Sacrifice also compassion and most of all Loyalty of Friendship and Family.  You will cry but Gus will make you laugh right to the end!  An incredible masterpiece you will remember forever.  It is the best Western Epic Ever Made.<br /><br />Incredible Cast!  Robert Duvall Tommy Lee Jones Danny Glover Angelica Houstan Rick Schroder Robert Urich Diane Lane Steve Buscemi Chris Cooper and many more..<br /><br /><3 <3
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|Loved it. Wish Riordan could somehow finish his books faster. The pace is perfect. The change in perspective keeps you guessing and wanting more.
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|The movie was OK I know it's popular, it had a nice message, but was ruined by the horrible playback of on-demand
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Expecting very little, I was extremely pleased with this latest episode in the Rebus saga. I couldn't put the book down. Rebus' hiatus has lifted his spirits immensely. I have rarely enjoyed a book this much.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|Excellent fit for my Kindle Fire HD..an outstanding value for low cost!<br />Definitely recommend to all if fashion is not a high requirement.
1932100660|5.0|This book changed my life!  Bought it along with the book 'Forks Over Knives'.  I did a total change of my diet based on the information contained in 'The China Study'.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great sony product and on sale was just a bonus.Works well and came in new package with charge cable and instructions and paid half what it cost at gamestop.
B00197POXG|5.0|Ordered this series for our daughter.  She's 26 yrs. old and I don't even know how many times she's viewed these.  This is a wonderful wholesome series that's good for the entire family to watch over and over.

0547884591|5.0|I bought this book to make my life easier and more enjoyable,<br />which it undoubtedly will.  There's no question about it, Tim<br />Ferriss has done it again.<br /><br />Enter 4 Hour Chef: Learning Anything.<br /><br />Tim has a fascinating brain -- I say this as his friend, as well as<br />his student.  Everything he writes, I read -- I do this because<br />I find mentors who simplify life achievement, verify many things<br />they say to me through practical experience, and then I learn to<br />trust them.  This is called 'Modeling,' and it's a large part of my<br />success in sport, life, and career.<br /><br />Modeling is one example of how you learn quickly and cut a<br />learning curve, but Tim talks about much more than this.  One<br />important concept that has really stuck with me is 'Deconstructing'<br />anything you want to learn.  I know we learned this in grade school<br />at some point, but it's an important and primary step to learning<br />the fastest way to... well, learn.<br /><br />Deconstruct a complex task into smaller ones, then figure out<br />which pieces matter most, and learn the minimum possible for<br />maximal impact.  In the example of 4 Hour Body, Tim did this<br />with exercise and nutrition:<br /><br />  Exercise example for fat loss:  100 kettlebell swings per day<br /><br />  Nutrition example for fat loss:  \\"30 in 30\\" -- 30 grams of protein<br />  in the first 30 minutes you're awake each morning<br /><br />These 2 tips, although incredibly simple, are responsible for<br />many people losing in excess of 100 pounds and not gaining<br />it back.  Very impressive!<br /><br />In business, Tim taught me some primary steps to be able to<br />reach the greatest number of people with the smallest amount<br />of effort, which allows me to provide more personal attention to<br />true 'individual' needs.  The scalable growth, especially in terms<br />of number of lives affected, is outstanding when you think about<br />business and healthmentorship in these terms.<br /><br />Now, Tim has written the third book of his trilogy, 4 Hour Chef.<br />You might make the assumption that it's about cooking, but<br />it's really not.  He uses cooking as an example to teach you<br />how to learn anything you want in the fastest way possible, but<br />other topics include:<br /><br />  Learning to swim (after being an adult and not knowing how)<br />  Learning a language in less than 30 days<br />  Becoming awesome at golf<br />  Winning the national title in kickboxing<br />  Asserting himself as the first non-Argentine Tango Champion<br /><br />...and there's plenty more.<br /><br />Imagine becoming world class in 1-2 things every single year<br />for the rest of your life -- how would your reality change?<br /><br />  Fat loss -- sure, there's an answer, and it's simple.<br />  Muscle building -- even easier -- Tim gained 34 pounds of muscle in 30 days with a cumulative 4 hours of exercise.<br />  Language -- experience another culture, fully, in just 30 days.<br /><br />Step into your new reality, with me -- I'll be learning by your side.<br /><br />When certain people speak (write), listen.  Tim Ferriss is one<br />such guy -- most people that read his books find them to be<br />some of the most influential they ever read.<br /><br />5 Stars here, my friend.  Read this:<br /><br />4 Hour Chef: Learning Anything -- Order this asap.<br /><br />have a great day,<br /><br />Dr. Kareem<br /><br />PS - I don't make anything for this recommendation.  I'm<br />offering you the opportunity to 'read' over my shoulder --<br />and learn what I'm learning -- because I feel fortunate to<br />have the contacts I do; I want to share with you, and<br />knowledge is most valuable:<br /><br />4 Hour Chef: Learning Anything -- Order this asap.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said many times before? This is the one that started it all. Scary, chilling, shocking, and entirely irresistable.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|In the first hour or so there is a slight problem with the dvd,however it does not impact on the total veiwing and conclusion of the dvd.Also the dvd arrived earlier than expected.thanks.
B003UESJDI|4.0|Tamara Drewe is a funny English film that made me laugh out loud.  It's also a lot deeper than that---insights about life and how you want to live yours----just settle or be truly happy.  Will you take the risk?  Those questions were answered in the film.  I enjoyed the t-shirt worn by the writer from America, actor Bill Camp.  Who is Rex the Surf Dog anyway?  Find out by going to his blog---[...]
B002MQYOFW|3.0|First of all,  don't get me wrong,  I loved this book. But there is a reason I gave it only 3 stars. While I adored Katniss' admiration I couldn't help myself from wanting to slap her sometimes as well. She is so ignorant until about 98 percent of the book about Peeta actually being in love with her. Like come on,  really? It was kind of cute at first,  but as the book went on it got a tad annoying. I kind of figured Collins does it on purpose and maybe I'll think differently after reading Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Thank god I didn't read this right when it came out and have to wait to start Catching Fire because I was more than dissapointed with the ending. Peeta's justifiably upset and Katniss wishes things were different. While some reviewers found Katniss unrelatable I found her more relatable than ever in this moment. Being so utterly confused and wishing things were different,  being in a love triangle. I just really wish it didn't end like that,  to me it was a weak ending. Also I could not get over how much this novel reminded me of Lord of the Flies. The thought came into my mind several times throughout this book. Hopefully Catching Fire and Mockingjay blow all my doubts out of the water because I truly did enjoy this fast paced,  riveting book.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|Well it will be a classic for sure in a few more years (2015)!  I saw this movie before Christmas in 2000 and just knew that I would one day watch it with my grand kids! (Not there yet)  This is fun for the whole family and is such a feel good, set by the fire drinking egg nog with all your kids and kin wonderful Christmas movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|start with the free app then upgrade.  you do run out of time but keep coming back daily to get free recharge.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The pictures and test drive for this app were misleading. The app contained only a fraction of the sounds shown in the pictures and test drive.  Very disappointed.<br /><br />Edit: Developer e-mailed right back when I mentioned my complaint about this app--supposedly there's an update coming in a week or so to correct the layout and sound loop problems.<br /><br />As of 12/21 this app has been updated to include all of the sounds on the test drive (plus 12 new ones) and has corrected the looping problem.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|First off, I'm a huge fan of Mr. DeMille's books in general, and the John Corey books in particular. That having been said, I think it's time for Corey to be killed in the line of duty. I'm sure Kate looks good in black. This book uses much of the same structure -- even the same jokes -- as all of the other Corey books. There's nothing new here, except an excruciatingly dull, plodding pace. The middle 300 pages are essentially wasted space. Read Plumb Island and Lion's Game and you'll get the best Corey material deMille has to offer. Sadly, it's all downhill from there.
B003P4MTSY|3.0|It is still hard to watch 3d outside of a movie theater, but this is a close 2nd after you get used to it..worth it to update my dvd collection to the next level.
B00973DDN2|5.0|This album is great. It did not disappoint. Still have that signature sound without sounding old. Defiantly recommended for anyone who liked anything from the killers in the past.
0857680986|5.0|The original book was printed in 1943 and has just been reprinted last year.  It certainly remains one of the most outstanding books on figure drawing.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I always loved Upstairs Downstairs and this is similar except in a castle in the country.  One sees who the landed gentry and their servants lives at this historic time in Britain.  The acting is wonderful with both well known actors as well as less known.  One really feels as if one is part of the scenes.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I found this book to be most enlightening and well written.  The author uses the current research in neuroscience and his own interviews to make the case for early childhood interventions as a solution to many of our educational shortcomings in the public school sector.  Stress at an early age will debilitate the child with lasting effects.  The neurochemical alterations in the brain brought about by stress will manifest themselves in the behavior of the child, teen, or adult.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Love florence and this album seriously rocks. Love that it was only $4! I've been listening to it non-stop :)
B004SBQGHS|2.0|this version does not install on google nexus 7 with android 4.2. it downloads but when i touch the Install button, it says x App not installed. please fix.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a great book and one that I am reading for the second time. I read it years ago when I was quite a bit younger. The story is gripping. I have not yet finished the book but cannot put it down once I begin reading a section. Jean Valjean is a prime example of how a person from wretched circumstances can have his life so completely turned around and become a true servant to community.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I really like this game, I wasn't sure at first but once you understand it, it is fun. You basically have to match and mix colors to get to the next level. It is a fun game to just take your mind off things for a few minutes.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is one of the classics that I have downloaded onto my Kindle from Amazon. I like that it didn't have a cost and loved the story. It is good literature and I would recommend it to others, especially writers who could gain some tips on telling a good story.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Haven't even touched my gps since getting this rangefinder.  It is very easy to track the pin and is very accurate.  Very happy with my purchase and worth every penny.
B007SGM084|5.0|It is a good read.  Don't listen to anyone else about poor writing, if you enjoy a good easy read then here you are.  I've read it multiple times and will continue to do so.
B005SZNZAY|3.0|This cd was ok.  I bought it for the high ratings but haven't been that impressed.  It maybe one of those albums that takes a couple times listening all the way through for my to catch on.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is not what I expected, it was better!! I'm glad it wasn't just a historical novel but a real page turner.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|cool game addictive.  fun to play easy to play.  good graphics.  it is family friendly.  it is awesome. it is easy to learn.  it is challenging.  it is easy to access.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I owned it previously, loaned it out, didn't get it back.  Loved the acting and the music - the stars complemented each other.
B0085A9J18|3.0|It's isn't English only subtitles.  Really wish there was an English spoken version but its okay just read a lot
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This games is very fun and addidicting. Sure its hard at first every game is and aftervthe first few founds you get the hang of it and t becomes fun again! I strongly advice you too buy this game now!!!!
B001OSIV62|1.0|Quit watching this, it was very boring.  Wish I could get refund but nevermind.  No thanks thought this would be a lot better.
0385523912|5.0|This book is a great read and very informative.  I have enjoyed reading it at every opportunity to find out more about day to day life in the most tryanical regime on the planet.
0143034901|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  My favorite modern writers include Eco, Marquez, and Susanna Clarke, so I tend toward the imaginative.  If you prefer modern literature of the New York Times Book Review variety, this book is probably not for you.  It is highly imaginative, verging on the Gothic.  I found the plot to be a bit much, but I can live with that.<br /><br />I loved the tone, the imagery, the vividness of this novel.  In it, Barcelona was a character, I felt that I spent time in Barcelona every evening when I read.  I enjoyed the colorful characters and the quirky set on which the drama was staged.  There were times I stayed up too late to discover what happens next.<br /><br />Some reviewers complained that they saw the surprises coming.  I did not, but I tend to read with credulity- going with the flow of the narrative rather than analyzing the text.  However, I think we could all do with fewer surprises in our entertainment.  It seems to me that, since M. Night Shyamalan, we all expect an astounding Aristotelian reversal.  I could do with less of these.  I prefer a writer just tell his story.  I don't need to have my mind blown, I just need to take a trip, to gain some insight, to spend time with other people in other places.<br /><br />This is a promising writer with a notable first attempt.  I absolutely recommend buying this book.
B00006IX0R|5.0|There are about 20 songs in this album and it's a great value for this price. I left this CD in my car and it never brings any trouble with my car's CD player. The Cranberries is my favorite band as always.
1612930425|5.0|I love this story and can read it again and again because it continues to make my heart skip a beat!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can I say, for the same amount of money (minus shipping), I got the DVD, Blu-ray and Digital copy (3D was not something I needed).  I will be buying all new releases this way in the future.  Sorry Wal-Mart.
B000O77SOK|5.0|This is a fabulous tv show, and it is the birth place of the best show ever produced: Boston Legal! So, where is the rest of it? They released volume one and that was it? We as customers should be more respected! I am still expecting the full series to be released!
B003E88TKS|5.0|An excellent movie with George Clooney at his best. The supporting cast is supberb. A mix of drama and comedy deftly handled. The only negative is the subject matter of people losing their jobs and in the manner of how it's done. In this day and climate it can be some what distasteful to watch.
0547884591|5.0|This book is jammed with so many cool things that even if you're not interested in cooking at all it's still worth the price of admission. There's so much to learn in this world and this book teaches you how to learn.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The movie came in a short amount of time and was in original packaging, which i wasn't expecting. My daughter loves this movie, so i'm glad i could make her happy.
B00846REIS|5.0|Such an easy read!I read through the  book 1 and 2 in 5 days. Cant wait for 3 in May!
B0086700CM|5.0|Eveiryone should play, although if everyone played nothing would ever get done! Lol I really don't have any complaints other than a few glitches that cause the game to randomly stop and go to my homescreen or it just freezes up. However I love the game so much that I just don't care!
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I watched season one and loved it,decided to purchase season two and it gets better with each season.The story is excellently portrayed by a cast of seasoned actors/actresses.It's a must watch series,
B009NXD90I|4.0|My husband has been wanting to watch this again for a while. It's a great old classic film, before the days of high tech computer graphics movies depended on good acting.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This show is, and this season, show why this series is the most popular in cable history.  Some, and by some I mean a small fraction of people give it bad reviews because they are expecting horde after hordes of zombies to keep attacking people with unlimited ammo, and that just is not how this goes.  This show has a plot, a meaning, and a purpose, and dare I say it, even some decent drama that you can relate to in real life.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Excelente SuperHero Movie. Hoping Avengers 2.<br />IronMan, Thor, Hulk, American Cap, hewkee and the beatiful Black widow are excelents heros
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Book had all words needed to play words with friends along with easy to understand definition. Recommend this for school age.
B007R21JJK|2.0|I built my own computer with this as my motherboard. It worked great and had many good features. But that lasted about three days and then my computer wouldn't boot up. After some diagnostics, I figure out it is my motherboard that's the problem. So it's good for a weekend, then it dies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this. it helps me when I'm bored its when Im babysitting they are gave I can play with the kids
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I read this book in a few hours, shuffuling errands and laundry in between. It is my first Deepak  Chopra read but certainly it won't be my last. At last I've found the inspiration I've been searching for this year.

B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! I am addicted. My kids love it as well. Download this game you wont be sorry. :)
B0052GACNM|4.0|It's Tony Bennett - what's not to like?  Plus like that he did duets with others so makes it more diversified.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I hate myself for reading this book. Best Seller?  This is what's wrong with America. I knew nothing of the premise of this book thinking it was a spy story. Ugh.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I appreciate that only one ad pops up before the game begins, which I can quickly close out of, and then the rest of the game is ad-free. This is very nice for a free app. Furthermore, the game runs very smoothly. Worth downloading.
0143119680|5.0|Loved it! The first book for this author and I will follow her! Demons, witches AND vampires! She put them all in it.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book is a rich tale of a young girl named Mary. I recommend this book for all ages.  :)
B006ON41FC|1.0|Just trying it out. I don't care for this game. Maybe for others just not for me. That is all.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Outstanding album, especially the first track, &#34;Slinky Thing&#34;. The rock/jazz style is very similar to Fagen's other work (and therefore pleases me greatly).<br /><br />Fagen/Steely Dan fans will not be disappointed.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is the perfect alarm clock. It's reliable and always accurate. Also, you can preprogram it for days, weeks, or months if you wish. There are an infinite number of sounds/songs you can set as the tone as well.
B003IMMEKG|4.0|I live in the USA, Region A.  This Blu ray disc is from the UK and is listed as region B.  The movie itself and the extra &#34;Arnold Schwarzenegger - The Man Who Raised Hollywood&#34; play fine on my region A player. The second extra &#34;Red Sonja vs. Kalidor - The Making of a Misunderstanding&#34; does not play.  On one of my Blu ray players this extra will not even come on when selected.  On my other Blu ray player the screen is black during playback of this extra but I can hear the audio and see subtitles on the screen.  There is some sort of compatibility issue.<br /><br />Aside from this small issue the disc works fine in my region A players.  Red Sonja has never looked this good!  The picture quality is great!
1407130293|5.0|Excellent price and a very good read. Hard to put down. I saw the first movie and enjoyed it, but the book is much better. This way I dont have to wait for the next two movies.
0547884591|5.0|\\"You know you are right when you are in the wrong\\"<br /><br />is what I say I learned from Tim's previous two books, and this one reinforces the idea even further. Be wrong until everybody wants to take tips from you and you suddenly become right !<br /><br />The book celebrates the idea that you should not be a machine designed for one purpose, the book carries promise that you should master whatever you want and learn whatever you want in as many subjects that you want, effortlessly. Oh and be a master if you choose to.<br /><br />Be it cooking, languages, survival, dieting or dining or many, MANY others.<br /><br />I see some material recycled from four hour body, which saddened me at first because I've read that book countless times to get the principles contained therein right, and now I have to browse through them again, but then again, Tim encourages you to skip around. I would not do that If I were you, devour this book immediately !<br />Who knows it may save your life, or perhaps the world...<br /><br />p.s. I was really happy to see some political involvement into sustainable farming and emphasis on supporting local small farms and producers. Most authors stay out of political ideas to avoid heat or just because their lofty spineless ideas stray from such subjects, but here you have it right in the introduction, I like that.
1423140605|5.0|My daughter is a superfan of Rick Riordan.  She loves every single book of this author.  This is no exception.  She dives into the book and have already read it three times.
B009AZZEU2|2.0|Considering that this is suppose to be come back album, it's very weak. I'm simply borred by this album. It is much weaker than Soundgarden from 16 years ago. No energy, no rock and roll spirit. Only song \\"Halfway There\\" caught my attention.
1400069289|5.0|Its a pretty good book but dont expect it to magically be able to give you superhuman powers and be able to quit any habit you want.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Bought this for my mom for a Christmas gift and she is more than happy!  Glad to have added this to her collection.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|The whole family enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite...an endearing and unique cast of characters.  We laughed from the first scene and were touched by how the story turned out in the end...sweet :)
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I had to add this to my movie collection!  The actors, the scences, etc. make this movie worth having and my son watches it every night.
044024630X|2.0|Readers of Lee Child's lengthy Jack Reacher series know that he left the military under a black cloud, but until now, the reason was never made clear. Now Reacher's back story is presented, as the thirty-fivish Major Reacher is sent to a Mississippi military training center for damage control, when it appears that one of the army's own may be responsible for the murders of three local women. It soon becomes apparent to him that he's being kept in the dark by his commanders, and he sets out to expose what turn out to be massive corruption at the highest levels.<br /><br />The reader is supposed to admire Reacher's strong sense of justice and morality. Actually, the man presented here is thoroughly amoral. A lethal amalgam of Dirty Harry and the Terminator, this Reacher is no better than the criminals he's out to nail. Characters whom he views as victimized are ruthlessly avenged by him. Those who perpetrated the victimization are brutally exterminated. His behavior, indeed his entire way of thinking, is narcissistic and sociopathic. He's a killer. Not a man to emulate, and certainly not my idea of a hero. Lee Child is a skilled writer and a great story teller; I just wish, in this series, he'd create some characters with some depth and humanity. There are none in The Affair.
B007UWBQEU|4.0|One of the best albums that Carrie has made.  The title song Blown Away is great.  I would recommend this album for any one who is a country music fan.
B000I9X54Q|4.0|Only 2nd in line to the original.  Favorite part is the beginning that show some history with the elder vamps.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is really good. I couldn't set it down for one second, I just had to know what was gonna happen next.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|The game is a fun retro version of Galaga or Space Invaders. You have a dino-spider-something with a gun at the bottom of the screen that you tilt your screen left and right to move. It fires automatically. Enemies fly in from the left and right and try to steal your eggs (lives) from the bottom of the screen and if they succeed you die (lose). You can also die from touching the enemies or being hit by their fire. As you kill the enemies they will drop power ups that allow you to fire faster, double or triple bullets or sometimes give you back a heart (health). So basically Galaga.<br /><br />The only difference is that the tilting is a great way to control your Velocispider. It is intuitive and easy to use for my kids or myself. Very well done.<br /><br />Remember to lock your In App Purchases with a PIN. Go to Settings, then go to Controls and add in the lock. Otherwise if you give this to your children they could make purchases. (These controls are one of the reasons I like Amazon's App Store over Google's.)
034580404X|5.0|We purchased the trilogy for a friend as a gift because she loves to read.  After purchasing it many of her friends wanted to borrow the book set to read for themselves.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|...I'm guessing, because neither this nor Angry Birds Space even show up in the list of My Apps on my first-gen Fire. Also don't work on my son's Polaroid tablet, so he's always asking to play them on my phone.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great story! Great Beginning and knowledge as to where the xenomorphs came from in Alien. Can't wait for part II
B004JHY80I|1.0|sorry, i couldn't stand reading all this twisted drama.... :-( too much misery... very descriptive, nice writing but couldn't stand reading the story....
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Great fun that brings back fond memories. Would recommend to any RPG lover that wants a bit of nostalgia. Definitely worth the price :)
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Ok hopefully this is my last update for this review. After several emails all is fixed for my app/kindle! Works great now! Thanks again amazon!! Update. Giving it 2 stars now because they \\"fixed\\" the update issue. And it really seemed as if they did but now it force closes EVERYTIME I use the app. Really starting to not be satisfied. So far $1.99 has been completely wasted with this app. The following is my original review. Same exact problem as other reviewer stated. Wants to update but I see absolutley no way to do so. I have tried uninstalling app and everything else my kindle will allow. When fixed I would love to give the app 5 stars because it really does exactly as it says. When it worked that is... Never had a problem before with my kindle fire or Amazon apps. I have been buying and updating apps for my kindle for a year now so I doubt I'm confused... Hope it gets fixed because app is way to expensive not to work...
3822884979|5.0|Must read for the pin-up lover. Young or old, once you pour over this book, you will see everyday women as you have never seen them before. Great for any purpose. Enjoy!
B005MYOWUS|5.0|I would read this book, and sing it, to my boys growing up. Now that I lost my Mom last year, it has new meaning to me and ready to read it all over again to my grand children, but changing the one word.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch for myself for my birthday. This watch appealed to me for a few reasons and delivered in every single one:<br /><br />Style: I absolutely hate the men's watches that are in style right now with their comically huge faces and bands. This watch is just the right size to be classy and manly but not ridiculous looking. Also, the glass backing is a very nice touch and supply endless hours of entertainment, if you're into that kind of thing. It has a great weight to it: enough to know that it's there but not enough to offset the suitcase you're carrying in your other hand... sort of thing...<br /><br />Movement: Japanese movement and self winding mechanism. I am no watch expert but from the little research I did I heard that Japanese movement was the best that money can buy and it has a very pleasing feel and appearance.<br /><br />Quality: Typically watches with bands like this, NATO bands and the like, I find the bands unravel and need to be replaces once every few years. The band is very comfortable on the skin and very well made.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|While this may not be my favorite of their available dvd performances (that goes to their 2007 reunion show), this is a must have for any serious zeppelin fan. I felt the movie was a little bit way over the top, but that was part of the whole bands concept.
B0091V6TJ0|5.0|Although ingrained with a strong CAN bias, I disagree with the notion offered up by other reviewers that this release could/should have been shortened to a single CD. Admittedly some songs are stronger than others-as is bound to be the case when releasing a triple album, let alone mining through outtakes and forgotten sessions. That said, I am so excited with this release. To be able to hear fresh, &#34;new&#34; CAN as a 30 year old who missed Krautrock in its time is a delight. Now....if only we could get the Faust fellows to dig into some of their archives...
B009E3EXMU|5.0|What else can be said that isn't implied in the title of this review? Not a single second wasted in this performance and this bundle is perfect for those of us who don't want to purchase the items separately. My only issue was how long this took to come out considering the show was 5 years ago. That and the fact they didn't play more songs but who can blame them, their catalog is  almost endless (one of the few bands who matched quantity with quality).
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Landay is a wonderful writer.<br />Defending Jacob is a compelling read full of<br />twists and unrequited trust. I enjoyed it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Finished reading this series in a couple of days... I dreaded having to put the book down to go about my daily business!! I don't think I have ever really enjoyed a book as much as this one. Being a huge Battlestar Galactica fan, I was able to notice very similar development and themes. All of the characters were extremely developed and I found myself cheering for them the entire time.<br /><br />I would like to thank the author for writing such a great book. I can't wait to read the next in the series and see the movie!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|A mix of the old and the new brought on a bunch of nostalgia in this hard hitting action packed adventure! Definitely a popcorn worthy movie. I love the gunshots impacting with blood spraying on every hit. I don't think anyone 'got dead', and there are lots of them, without a blood letting for the audience. Now I'm thinking 3D... I only wished that some of the other well known actors with cameo roles had more exposure. But some, well, not so much. Dolph had a terrible role as a boozer with a gun. They could have done much better with him. I guess when you have so many stars in such an action packed movie with a limited amount of time, you can't make them all the top dawg of stars, even though they could be. Stallone obviously had the major role. That's ok, though, it was still entertaining in what must have been a pretty complicated process of matching this gaggle full of stars with the various roles. If you like non stop blow-'em-up bang bang from a team of angry warriors with attitudes type of film, well this is for YOU!
B006LSZECO|2.0|not a favorite.  my book club chose it. it did not get better with discussion. would not recommend it to others
B003VS0CWY|5.0|I've owned this movie in VCR tapes, a DVD and now Blue-ray (obviously it's one of my favorites). The Blu-ray version is definitely clearer and more vivid. This is a great price, too.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|My son is 8 years old and just started getting into Harry Potter (he knew about Harry Potter before but they were scary to him when he was younger). He loves all the movies and added them all to his Christmas list. He enjoys all of them and if you don't see them all then you will be very confused when watching them so I recommended getting all 8 DVDs.
B0054VVRBQ|2.0|This card will not work in a Sony SXS slot with a SD card. Buy a Sonnet reader it does work

1442359315|5.0|I gave the book to my mom, and the book on cd to my dad, and they loved it! I can't wait to read it myself.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I really like Wikipedia. It always gives me quick, sure information on all sorts of things. I appreciate being able to quickly and easily find info at Wikipedia.
B000AP04NI|1.0|I purchased this DVD as I couldn't rent it, I'd heard so much about it and always liked 'O What a Beautiful Morning' and we LOVE Sound of Music.  This on the other hand was such a disappointment!  Story line was just lame, had no point - seemed like this movie was simply a vehicle for songs and dance numbers.  Most of the songs lyrically were awful! Offensive and crude - and this movie was rated G??????  As my 11 year old and 9 year old said, \\"This movie should have been rated PG or PG 13, NOT G!\\"<br />I'd love to return it.  My daughter has suggested that it be used as a white elephant gift - so at least we'll get that use out of it - complete waste of money...
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel keeps you guessing until the end and beyond.  The story captures your interest trying to stay with the cleverness of the characters.  A great suspense read.  I will look for this author again.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|great music its my favorite cd, all songs are great if you love kid rock you will love this cd
0345803485|5.0|While this isn't one of the typical romance books I usually read. When was asked by a friend to read it, the  more I read, I was so captured by the unbridled attraction and dynamics between the two main characters it became very hard to put down. I enjoyed the story line and but not so much the hard core S&M or whips and chain's. I did feel that Christian's attitude was a little on the abusive side mentally towards Ana and was a little disappointed that she didn't put up a bigger fight against the contract. I did like the fact that Ana does try to stand up for her beliefs even though she is confused by her bodies reaction to Christian's sexual appetites. There were times I wondered if Christian's \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" had something to do with his insistent not to be touched, even though he says that she wasn't. I would have like to know exactly what caused him to become the way he is.  I kept wondering if Christian was ever going to cut Ana some slack and admit he's in love with her. It often left me wondering what would happen next and kept my attention exclusively on the idea that maybe  Christian would realize he was in love with Ana.<br /><br />I feel the author E. L. James did a great job helping the reader understand what Christian's sex life is all about. Most people who are not into that kind of thing, like me, wouldn't really know what some of the tools and devises he uses. I also felt that it was interesting that he uses household items to tie her up and not just specialty items. The tie on the front of the book is a nice touch, even though you really don't know what it's meant for until you read the part about Christian using his tie to tie Ana up. E.L. James did a great job with the main characters. I felt at time like i hated Christian's attitude but then fell in love with the soft side of him that peaks out when he is honest with Ana. I liked Ana's smart attitude with some of the things Christian throws at her. I look forward to reading the next two installments of the trilogy.ents of the trilogy.

B006RXQBUC|4.0|I missed this movie when it came out.  Since watching Coppers on TV, I wanted to know more about New York at this time.
B000JQTWPO|4.0|My sister had this book when we were kids and I never got around to reading it. She had recommended it, so when I saw it in the Kindle version I decided to have a go. I'm glad I did.

1452110581|5.0|I love anything to do with CATS! This book was GREAT & Cute! I have lots & lots of books with  or about cats!
B000JMLKCG|5.0|I like this story the most of Hardy's works. An interesting tale with some good, realistic characters. I think I'll read it again.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|There's something about this album that almost haunts my soul... I can't finish a song without getting chills at least twice. I'd call that amazing...
B004N6369Y|5.0|This was such a great story! Complex and entertaining from beginning until end. Nice ending. I like where it left off.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I am going to keep this short and simple. It works very well. This is definitely one of the best headsets out there (definitely one of the best wireless ones)<br />I can walk around the house listening to my WMP playlist changing songs and sound level whenever I want. I can even go sit on the toilet and read a magazine and change songs and listen to music.<br />Gaming wise though it works very well. Good clear sound. No complaints yet :)
0307744434|4.0|This was an interesting read...very imaginative...different than anything I had read before.  I would recommend it if you are looking for something different than the traditional love story.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|THIS MOVIE BRINGS UP FEELINGS THAT AN OLDER PERSON MAY NOT HAVE FELT OR THOUGHT ABOUT IN THEIR LIFETIME.  I HAVE SEEN IT SEVERAL TIMES AND I CRY EVERY TIME.  IT'S A GOOD CRY.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN POSSIBILITIES.  I BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|The \\"bad egg\\" you forgot to mention is that there is no digital copy for those of us that use iTunes instead of the ROTTEN CRAPPY service known as Ultraviolet.  I used to buy DVD's every week and this Ultraviolet crap has RUINED my rights and experience.  It is such a scam.  I should be able to watch my \\"digital copy\\" how I choose, when I'VE PAID FOR IT.  Not forced to watch it from some WiFi cloud.........!!!  PLEASE STAND UP FOR US OUT HERE over this issue....

B008DVJMAW|2.0|I first discovered this band shaken the place on Paladia and they rocked.  This CD however, is kina mellow and slow.
B000W91RUG|5.0|this always makes me laugh.  I love watching the intraction of the cast of misfits.  It is so well done.
B008XNPO20|3.0|Music is def 5 stars for me, one of the best album in this year. However vinyl is in really cheap/poor quality.<br />The first copy I got has multiple dents on the disk one so I returned it and got a replacement one.<br />The 2nd copy also has dents here and there.<br /><br />If you love this album so much and insist to get vinyl version, this is what I can share with you:<br />1. It has 2 LPs in GATEFOLD jacket. I love gatefold.<br />2. It has cheap white inner paper sleeve may cause damage to the vinyl. I hate paper inner sleeve.<br />3. Both copy I got are warped slightly and both have dents here and there.<br />4. VERY bad pressing! Not quiet and not flat. Ticks and pops!<br />5. I don't feel sound quality is any better then digital one.<br />6. There is another version vinyl on the market. Google: Lonerism Limited Deluxe Edition Blue Vinyl + 7″. It's much more expensive but maybe it has better quality.<br />I don't own that one so I can't compare. But it's hard to get any worse then this one.<br />7. It comes with mp3 download card<br /><br />Would I recommend the music to friends?? YES! I love love this album! It's my morning commute soundtrack.<br />Would I recommend the vinyl version to friends? NO! I don't want my friends to hate me.

B004W2UBYW|2.0|Hard to get through some of it.  I usually gulp down my books, but this is taking a little longer, due to the fact that as brilliant as he was, he was really an unlikeable person.

B0076DELIG|5.0|The only problem I have with Michael Connelly's LAPD detective Harry Bosch series of mystery novels is that we only get one of them a year. Bosch is surely one of the best detectives in fiction and each book only leaves me hungering for the next one. The protagonists in many series novels never seem to vary from book to book as the authors take a cookie cutter approach to them. Bosh is different. Connelly tells us more about Bosch with each book. Bosh grows and changes and this makes his character more human and more believable. Bosch is not perfect. He is haunted by the ghosts of his past and he is not infallible. He makes mistakes and he has difficulty navigating through the political minefields he encounters in the Los Angeles Police Department. He is driven to find the answers and he pursues the solution to his cases with a single minded determination that often places his life, his job, and his personal relationships in jeopardy. All of Connelly's novels are carefully crafted. There is nothing in his prose which is not necessary and it is a pleasure to read. Perhaps this is a result of his training as a journalist. The plots are always excellent and in \\"The Black Box\\" it moves in an unexpected direction, building great suspense, and ending with a bang. I purchased the Kindle edition and for once someone did a competent and professional job translating the book into the digital world. And by the way, Mr. Connelly, if you happen to read this, thanks for turning me on to Art Pepper.
B00634GHJA|3.0|I dont use this app very much. It is pretty easy to use but I had already got use to hooking my phone up to my lap top. Still seems much easier.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Ordered on Thanksgiving and received the following Monday. Amazingly fast. DVD going to our troops in the Middle East. Thanks!<br /><br />BTW: This is a GREAT show - my wife and I really like it, especially in seasons 3 & 4.  Great stories, characters and photography!
B008C20TDG|5.0|I read health books frequently. I take email subscriptions from about a dozen health gurus. At any rate, the book is healthy read for both the novice as well as someone who can read Chris Masterjohn and not scratch their head.<br /><br />It Starts with Food, ISWF,  puts some pieces of the puzzle together for me that maybe I had read before someplace but did not get it, or possibly it truly was new info.<br /><br />The recipes are really wonderful! I purchased the Kindle edition and was able to print recipes with a little help from my hubby.<br /><br />Resources are top notch, many of which are listed on the whole9life website. I am also taking their Daily Emails while I go through my Whole30- definitely worth 50 cents/day.<br /><br />Check out their website, and I bet you'll want to get the book. I did, and I'm glad I bought it.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was not very well done but still entertaining.  Casting was good and the storyline was pretty good as well.
0312641893|5.0|I can't believe this book doesn't have more buzz around it. I really liked it and can't wait to get my hands on the sequel (due for release in Feb 2013)<br /><br />This book reminds me of a cross between Battle Star Galactica (a series that sounds majorly nerdy but really is addicting and fun to watch) and Ever After.  I will admit I guessed the ending to this book almost immediately, but that didn't take away from any of the fun.  The world is quite unique and for once, the main character may struggle with identity but not in the insecure self-conscious way you see in so many books right now. Cinder is strong and tough and I loved it.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I enjoyed the cast.  The movie itself was tongue in cheek but the humor by the cast made it enjoyable.  I did not get a good connection and the picture quality was not very good but it was viewable.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I, my wife and my daughter saw this filmed performance of the Phantom in a local movie theatre and we all loved it!  Theatre purists may argue that there is nothing as good as live theatre but I can't agree.  I saw Phantom on stage in Toronto years ago and had excelent seats, yet I was more captivated by this filmed version.  The advantage of the Royal Albert version is that it had roving camera eyes -- when a long shot was required, as with the chandelier scene, the camera was viewing from an audience seat; when a close-up of the actors' faces was required, the camera was right there.  (How they do this without intruding on the performance or stepping on the actors' toes, I can't imagine.)  The advantage is far better and more intimate viewer involvement in the performance.  Of course, another advantage is that this video is a lot cheaper than the price of a theatre seat at a major venue.  This is a wonderful performance with top-notch performers and is filmed beautifully.  My only complaint, and it's a fixable one, is that at the end of the play, Andrew Llyold Webber comes out, speaks a bit, introduces Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman (the original cast members) and four other former Phantoms who then sing with Ms Brightman.  It's a pleasant bit of business but anti-climatic to the play: it takes away from the emotional power of the main show.  I don't know how the DVD is formatted --whether this self-congratulatory part at the end is separated from the main film -- but my suggestion is that when Sir Andrew shows up, hit the stop button.  Watch this latter bit at a later time.  Enjoy this performance, as I think anyone who loves Phatom will.
B008M34INW|1.0|This had to be one of  the worst movies I have ever seen Mel was terrible. Maybe the story was true don't know
0547884591|4.0|I really enjoy Ferriss's books and blog, but the recipes he chose seem to be more East coast and West coast recipes. The recipes are fancier and less practical on a day to day basis and the ingredients are tough to find. I highly, highly recommend his 4 hour workweek and 4 hour body books, but the chef doesn't appeal to mass markets as well as it is in a smaller niche. The chef had great chapters in the beginning on how to learn new subjects quickly and efficiently and that in itself was worth the book's price, but the majority of the book did not relate to the average, common person (Cheap, quick, easy, and tasty recipes). A recipe from the book would be handy for large gatherings if you would like to have a dinner party.<br /><br />Thanks Tim for another good book!

B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is awesome. I have compleated almost all the puzzles including the random ones. Had lots of fun doing them. I tried the original ones that are all black but these ones are a lot more fun. I would like to do more. Any ideas...
B004W2UBYW|5.0|read the whole kindle book and i rarely read all of a book' well wish i knew the guy, well at least honestly his money. too bad he had a disease all the kings men couldn't cure even with that money wish him well whereever he is.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|enjoy playing the game......passes the time.  glad i got the app. :)  highly recomend it.  :)  makes a fun gift
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille always writes a superb suspense mystery.  I love the character John Corey, even though his<br />sarcasim gets a little old sometimes.  I am still reading the book, but based on the Lion series and how on the edge of my seat I was through the whole book, I am positive this one will have the same nail biting ending.
B0064NTZ6W|3.0|This flix will put to rest any ideas about the glamor of WWII submarine warfare.  This flix demonstrates why the Germain's call the Type VII subs &#34;pig boats&#34;
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I am getting very tired of the Scarpetta series and Kay Scarpetta.  Patricia Cornwell has Kay Scarpetta as a self absorbed, self centered, narcisistic individual and keeps going over and over the same stuff we have been reading for years that it seems she is trying to fill space to make the book seem thicker.  I do not enjoy reading Cornwell's books anymore.
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|This is a flix that you readily identify with the heroine.  You really feel for the girl for her grit and determination in a hard scrabble enviornment.  This is a straight up drama, no special effects or high intensity action, but it is an excellent movie that everyone can enjoy.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|For God's sake don't buy it!  It's worth borrowing it from somebody or rent it.  I won't go into the plot or acting, there are plenty of reviews out there for that.
B002VKE1J8|4.0|Very interesting story with many sub plots that are easy to follow.  Acting is excellent by all the cast.  Highly recommend.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If I could marry the movie, I would!  When I came out of the theater for the 1st time seeing this, I felt like a kid again when I came out of the theater for Star Wars.  The Blu-ray is great! Haven't had the chance to try the 3D.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really liked the book and I am almost done with the next book in the series.  They are written very well and I don't want to stop reading them.  But this book seemed very sililar to the fifty shades of gray series.  I would have liked the book better if I hadn't read the other books first.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I like the books, but the movie blew!  I am sorry bought this, I would have been happier just renting once.
B007SGM084|5.0|These were great books.  I didn't know how I would like them.  I don't usually get into these type of books.  The only complaint that I have about the books is that I could do without Ana's inner goddess.  It got a little old after a while.
B001TODO54|4.0|This was a re-read, or rather a re-listen.<br />I first read Graceling a couple of years ago and liked it a lot. The 4 stars I gave are definitely confirmed.<br />If you're tired to TSTL heroines, damsels in distress or love triangles, this is the book for you.<br />Katsa is a handful, a tomboy and the best fighter the Seven Kingdoms have ever known. Cashore leads us in a world of gracelings, special people gifted with special abilities, or \\"graces\\" and recognizable by their two-coloured eyes.<br />This time, just for once, you will meet a love interest who is not alpha male, still amazing, but who doesn't mind being inferior, at least for certain things, to a woman. You will love Po.<br />One extra symbolic star though goes to Full Cast audio, the team who masterfully realized the audio version of this book.<br />Listening to a story with a full cast of voices is amazing, the characters become so alive, it's not comparison to the usual one-reader soup we usually get.<br />If there is one book, ever, which you'd like to listen to instead of reading, it's this one. I guarantee it's totally worth it.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|This is an excellent movie, but don't buy it alone! For $29.96 you can get all 3 films on blue ray, much better deal!
B00190OHD6|5.0|It is a good movie. It shipped fast. And I would recommend it to a friend, family member, or another shopper.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|Not to give a spoiler but thee are two stories here, one more beautiful than terrible and one more terrible than beautiful. It is the tension that makes the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|A good preview to show some things that are going to be happening. I will probably go back and watch Season 1 and 2 so I will be all caught up and ready!
B0099114WO|5.0|As an &#34;older&#34; adult, I related to so much in this movie due to the time era.  A must see for any married couple, especially those who have been married over 25 years!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It is a fun game and I guess I misunderstood that it was free.  It was free until you ran out of the points they give you to start with and then you had to buy them.  Not good.  Also, there should be some kind of guide to tell you how to use power ups, etc.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Only an actress of Meryl Streep's genius could make a total SKANK ...\\"BUTCHER THATCHER\\"...SEEM HUMAN. Any role Meryl Streep commits to playing is elevated by her skill.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is by far the best season of the Walkind Dead so far. There is way more drama and gore and people going crazy. It's a dark, dark world in season 3.
B00942S4OY|4.0|Bought for my tweens - they of course can not get enough of these guys :)<br />I of course am ready to return it..ha
B00992CF6W|5.0|some people say that this is the worst ever true minecrafters would look at it and say memories because it is in alpha. Then there are others that are noons and say it ducks because that got it on x-box. I can look at ut from any perspective because I have it for Pc. Pocket Ed. and x-box.<br />Overall it is a great retro game in a way. because it gets a modern game and gives it a classic look. you survive an thrive. it isn't for everyone though. so this good. x-box is great. PC is the best.<br />kindle got auto-correct so don't mi.d the out of place words.

B00030DEQE|3.0|There was a lot of hype going around about these Intel NICs and home built NAS devices. I wasn't too impressed. I have a laptop and a desktop attached to my server running FreeNAS. My copy speeds were at +100MB/s to both devices, but when I installed this NIC into my server thinking it would do the same or better than the onboard NIC, I was wrong. Speeds decreased by half. I went back to the onboard, but I might eventually have a use for it in the future.
0547884591|5.0|So far, I have read the first few chapters and then skipped around and read things that caught my attention.  I love the integration of survivalism and cooking...which will be much needed if things keep going the way they do!<br /><br />This book is well put together as was all the other 4 Hour series...a must read..<br /><br />Thank you for putting this together as I have the Hard Cover and the Kindle version.
0307477479|3.0|For a Pulitzer Prize-winning work \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" leaves much to be desired.  While the writing is pristine and polished, and can be at times poetic and inspiring, there's no plot, the characters are so complex they're actually too simplistic, and often the book can descend into maudlin melodrama, teenage angst, or just outright pornography.  I suppose that the author can justify the constant change of perspective and characters as a metaphor for how in the age of Facebook we're all ultimately connected but can never be truly and intimately connected, not even with ourselves.  But that's an entirely obvious and hackneyed point, and the book's ultimate failing is the failure to create intimacy between the characters and the reader.<br /><br />In the jigsaw puzzle-like narrative, the protagonist is Sasha, who in the first chapter comes across as entirely identifiable and sympathetic.  When we first meet her she's on a date with a young affable douche bag named Alex, but her mind rings with the voice of her pyscho-therapist, paternally urging her to develop some order in her life and urging her away from her kleptomania.  But Sasha can't really help herself, and she ends up stealing a woman's purse in the bathroom, an act so exciting and exhilarating she wants to jump into bed right away.  But as she is about to leave with Alex the woman comes out of the bathroom screaming and in tears, and Sasha has to return the bag.  She's down now, and she just wants to go home alone, but Alex can't accept being turned away and so Sasha just takes him home.  And when Alex discovers Sasha's hidden stash of stolen goods she sleeps with him out of guilt and fear.  It's in the first chapter that we form an emotional connection with Sasha and thus the book, and it's this emotional connection that the rest of the book slowly and methodically tears down.<br /><br />The more we learn about Sasha the more unbelievable and distant her character becomes to us.  The way she's mutilated her body and her mind even before she even goes to college is not humanly possible, and there's something macabrely amateurish in the way that Jennifer Egan holds Sasha so pitifully and disgusting naked.<br /><br />But Sasha is only one-third the book.  The rest of the book is occupied by minor tangential characters, and their stories are silly and inconsequential.<br /><br />There's a lot of roads that starts out with so much hope and excitement in this book.  Unfortunately, they all lead to nowhere.
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|This movie, no, porno, was absolutely horrible: poorly acted and terribly written. I only wish I could get my money back
B005K17RU0|5.0|very good app for fire. get! !!!!!! . has some ads but its freaking awesomee!!!!  get it get it !
B005PK553C|5.0|I'm a horror fan and this show is just amazing! I will be watching this show for years to come
030758836X|3.0|Forced myself to keep reading this book because it was for my book club. That said, the majority of the women in my book club absolutely loved it; only 3 of us did not. The story did redeem itself in the end, however, (spoiler alert) because both main characters got what they deserved. Sort of.
B009H442DG|5.0|I enjoy this CD a lot. Olivia Newton-John's voice is pur joy, she sounds perfectly and John Travolta sounds & plays a charming crooner. The chemistry is still there and as in Grease they communicate it to us. This is a very good album that brings fun and warmth, exactly what we can expect from a CHRISTMAS CD ! & all the proceeds go to charities !
1451673442|5.0|This is a wonderful way to focus every day on different areas of gratitude.  I loved the exercises and will be restarting in December!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This is the kind of music you should blare out of your speakers on the highest maximum level.  It's fun, fearless and you can dance to it.  I'm 100% positive it would be amazing to see them play live.  I cannot get enough!  Buy the EP Sail while you're at it.  Sure it's remixes of the same song but if you shuffle them around on your mp3 player you won't notice.
158270208X|5.0|I keep my daily gratitude in this journal and I loved the 1st so much I just bought a second one.  It is the perfect size, light and has lovely quotes.  If you are looking for a gratitude journal, this one is lovely.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow. Where to begin. Let me start by saying that this is the best book I've read in a long time. The story was amazing, keeping you turning the pages, not wanting to stop reading and not wanting the story to end because it's so good! There's not extra fluff, the prose isn't flowery - and yet it is written with much more beauty than most of the stuff I read. It has a way of giving you the story without extra padding or heavy description or exposition and yet makes you take a breath every once in a while to appreciate the refined poetic way Hugh Howey writes. This guy is a gifted storyteller AND a gifted writer. You don't see that often. It isn't easy to write in a way where the words don't get in the way of the story and the reader is able to just take it in and enjoy what's happening to the characters. If you get that in a book you know you're in good hands, but when they can do that and still sprinkle in amazing prose that has such a poetic beauty with wonderful images, similes, thoughtful ideas, well - you get Wool by Hugh Howey. Beyond all of that, the story world Hugh has built is so awesome! You just want to keep reading more about it. I'm so glad he's now writing the Shift books going back in time and telling us how the Silos came to be. I cannot wait to dig into the first prequel book First Shift! This guy is my hero. He has been cranking out these Wool books at an amazing pace and you'd think he spent years on them. They are just so well written and the stories are so well crafted. Now that I've read them for pleasure I think I'll have to do a slow reread, taking notes on why it is so good so I can learn from it as a writer how to do it right. Hugh Howey does it right in so many ways with Wool: Omnibus. Best book of 2012 hands down.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|I still like his first album more, but there is clearly maturation and refinement occurring. I like the fact that I like to listen to these albums in their entirety.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The book was a quick read and gave me a lot of information on how to change up my routine. I think the hardest part of choosing a workout plan is the nutrition and this book has a lot of information as to what you should eat and when as well as why. The bonus report is the best part though since that gives you workout plans for an entire year as well as the author's recommendations for supplements and a few recipes. I tried his Baked Oatmeal Raisin and it was delicious. That will be a big reason to finish a workout to know that when I get home I get to eat that! And if you have any questions about your plan, the author will answer your questions. I sent him an email asking if my plan was set up correctly and he emailed me back with suggestions. I always think it's amazing when authors write back!
B005QUQP76|5.0|I came from using the Logitech Anywhere MX wireless. I was looking for a decent gaming mouse and after a week of research, I ended with this one. Before that, I went out to BestBuy and got a Logitech G700 wireless for $59.99 after reading so many good things about it. However, I ended up returning it the next day because I absolutely dreaded the \\"sand paper-ish\\" grip, which actually made my palm sweat only 5-10 mins into using it. This one, although has the rugged surface grip also, but it is not as dreadful as the G700's. Sniping has never been so much fun. The sniper button, although a bit of a reach for the thumb to activate, it was easily coped with by just adjusting the grip a bit (won't be a problem for users with long fingers though). Build quality-wise, seems like it's made up of high quality materials. Doesn't feel cheap. All in all, a very decent FPS gaming mouse - especially for claw/fingertip grip users, though, palm grip users coming from a rather small mice would still enjoy it too. This is coming from a buyer initially wanting a wireless gaming mouse and has already tested the Logitech G700.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I picked this up for less than $40.00.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great picture / sound quality (Wouldn't expect less from Bluray)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not the original theatrical release in bluray.<br />No true extras<br /><br />Recommend: Of Course!
B002V0929W|4.0|Maybe I was waiting for something breakthrough by buying this book, I don't know. It is very funny sometimes, but there are pages, where I just couldn't get through without feeling, it is boring and tries to find stereotypes even, if it is just a normal human behaviour.<br />If you can relate to it maintaining the distance of taking everything written in it, as a rule, you will be amazed (sometimes).
0393088774|5.0|Krugman has strong opinions in this book and explains why.  He's been correct before. It's within the lay person's grasp and explains the economic issues and the academic and political context of our continued recession, as of November, 2012, as I write this.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I love this book. I read recently in twitter as one of the books, which was suggested to be a good book by Bill Gates, so I bought it. It is from the first page on very interesting, tells good stories, I like to read it.
1419705849|5.0|My 9-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter both enjoy this series, especially this book. My son said they have really funny characters who do really fun things.  Both kids would recommend it to kids who like to laugh while they read and they both read it in one sitting.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|After watching the very first episode, I was hooked and I have now purchased every season except the latest one.
B002PMPTIO|3.0|I love the movie.  The background music was good.  But the speaking sounded very distant; not just quiet.  I was very disappointed with that.  It downloaded easy enough.
B000W93CHC|5.0|It is an amazing, readable picture in print of an era that is fascinating but not that familiar to me.  This is the second of two books with characters that leap out of the print and stay with you!  I wouldn't recommend reading this one first, however.  Start with the first book. I can't even imagine how much research it took to portray the time so clearly.
0547569653|5.0|You don't have to be an Ultra Runner to enjoy this book.  It is very inspiring to read the determination it took to accomplish what he did.
B008NR8YTQ|3.0|The next Gary Moore CD I buy, I will review first.  I know he put out some good songs, I buy one with his songs.

B0086213XW|5.0|This is not a light Hollywood RomCom. This story explores the chemistry of relationships. Margot is happily married to a good guy, a chef named Lou.  They have fun and a nice life where their friends and family love them as a couple.  Five years into a marriage, they do not have a deep connection, but a superficial one where they are content with the companionship that grows over time.  There is a lot of nurture & familiarity in their relationship but no spark.<br /><br />The two are different from each other.  Margot feels the space between them but does not want to explore what is happening on a deeper level until she meets a carefree urban hobo / artist by chance when visiting a local landmark.  She later realizes that he lives across the street from her.  Daniel, the artist seems to see past her normal facade and made up excuses and stories.  He calls it for what it is and makes her realize that she does not want everyday security but a raw deep connection with someone who feels her being deeply and allows her to be an individual.<br /><br />The film is shot in beautiful urban Toronto. The backdrop and streets are full of color and life. The main characters of Margot and Daniel are played by the talented and adaptable Michelle Williams and hunky, deep and slightly mysterious Luke Kirby. Michelle gives a great performance of a young woman who is not sure what is lacking in her life. She tries to hold on to the things that others say are good for her and struggles with being pursued by a slightly obsessive suitor. The cerebral and sexual tension between the two actors heightens as the film progresses.  One of the best non sex, erotic scenes happens in a cafe where Daniel tells Margot what he will do with her (this happens about 45 minutes into the movie). Luke Kirby looks at Michelle Williams as if he can see deep into her soul and Michelle looks increasingly like she has been carried away on a cloud when she looks at him.  The acting is superb.  Excellent performances are also seen by Sarah Silverman and Seth Rogen.<br /><br />This is now one of my all time favorite movies.  I hope to see more from Sarah Polley who wrote and directed this movie.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Wonderful CD, Great song...Was a Great buy, New songs and she couldn't sing them any better!!!  She is the BEST..
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its a really good game but eventually you would get bored of it (like all games) and you will uninstall it but trust me last you will regret it and reinstall it Wichita is what I'm doing now and b.t.w. that's why I knocked a star off I think 5 stars is for nothing but a 100% great game and there is nothing you can do to make it ANY better whatsoever ^.^
B00992CF6W|5.0|there is a glitch put a block down push arrow on bottom of screen then delete game then reinstall it play tame again you still have block in inventory and it is placed down
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This game is probably wonderful for an older child.  My 2 year old daughter doesn't quite understand how to do it yet.  It's also kind of confusing as to what you are supposed to do.
0316069884|5.0|Great book.  Good reading for those interested in the food processing production.  I had previously inquired about this book at a bookstore in my area.  It was more expensive.  Thanks Amazon.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|i saw this at the movies in i-max this was not to that quality but great for home blu-ray viewing
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|I tend to lean towards a lot of movies set in New York and this is a very nice movie and I'd recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 full stars isn't because I found fault with it but only because I save the 5 stars for movies I'd consider \\"classics\\" (It's a Wonderful Life, etc).  Again, it's a great movie that I'd recommend to any friend wanting to watch something they'd enjoy.<br />I watched the movie again last night and have to say I upped it to 5 stars.  I have to admit I was a bit distracted when I watched it the first time but paying full attention this time, it grew on me even more.  I'll give it 5 stars and call this one of my \\"classic\\" New Years Eve movies.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|saw this in theatre and am glad to have my own copy of this it was great. great show with wonderful special effects
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater & loved it! I preordered it & it arrived shortly after it was released.  My daughter watched it with me and she too loved it.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|You run out of tokens too quickly.  Need more chances at free tokens.  Don't want to buy extra tokens at all.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I could not wait to get this deluxe Ediiton of Celebration Day and I was not disappointed.  I seen Led Zeppelin in 1977 in Maryland and this was just as good.  Robert Plant's voice is still right on.  Roger Daltrey of the Who said that Robert Plant had the best rock & roll voice he had ever heard.  Robert nailed it.  What can you say about Jimmy Page, no one can play a guitar like this man.  He is way beyond the mortal man.  JPJ is great on the base & keyboards.  What an excellent musician he is.  Then last but not least Jason Bonham can wail on those drums just like his dad.  I know when you shut your eyes you can't tell if it is father or son.  They sound like they have been playing together forever not just a couple of months.  You can see the love in all their eyes when they look at each other.  You can tell they were enjoying themselves.  I think they were have just as much fun as the audience.  You feel like you are there also.  The song list is perfect.  I know as my husband & I watched we were taken back to another time when we were much younger.  I was quite sad when it was over cause it just left me wanting more.  All I can say is if you are a Led Zeppelin fan than get it & you will not be disappointed.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|this game has excellent graphics and was challenging. one of the best hidden objects games I have played in a while.  well done!
1451695195|3.0|I really though he would go more into the actual time and sights he was in heaven. Was a little disappointed .<br /> He is a Dr and looked at it scientifically and that was a little out of my league.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The music will sweep you into the world of Jean Valjean, Fantine, Cosette, and the entire cast! I would have loved to had the opportunity to see this live, but now I can see it whenever I want!
B0020M99LC|4.0|This is the first James Bond movie with Daniel Craig.  He makes a really great Bond.  It's better to watch this one first, and watch Quantum next since it is the sequel.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It does the job the way it should. I would recommend it to anyone who needs that kind of a gismo.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|One of the best Bond movies ever.  The action is almost non-stop.  The chase scenes are first rate.  It may rival Skyfall.
0670022950|5.0|bought this book for a class and it was definitely interesting but it is VERY long.  It feels long reading it
1581806574|4.0|This is an excellent book for anyone interested in trying to improve their drawing skills.  I bought this for my nephews for Christmas one year.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I love the show and comic, and thought it was great to have all the commentaries and behind the scenes features.
B003204MQS|3.0|It would be better if it were based on a true story.  It has some scary parts.  I am not sure if the number of sequels will capture everyone.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have always enjoyed historical novels and this one has prove to be exceptional. The characters blend with the facts of the time period beautifully.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|The authors have a knack for taking huge amounts of research and knitting a saga seen through perceptive eyes.  A pleasure to read.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|Dan Ariely's book is a fascinating story about dishonesty, supported by many experiments, which might lead you to think it's more like a doctoral thesis... But it's not, it's a funny and a very light read! I had a great time with this book, it made me think a lot. I definitely recommend it
B000LTAY1U|5.0|perfect,perfect,perfect, shopping expierence, dont need to say more. easy, perfect order process, even for old geezzers like me. perfeci,perfect. wow
1423140605|4.0|But, I think my expectations went a little bit over the roof from all this waiting.<br />Percy Jackson was, is and always will be my favorite book series.  But ever since the arrival of The Lost Hero, I've always felt that something was missing.<br />Something crucial, something that made me fall in love with the series in the first place.<br /><br />Oh right.  That would be Percy's POV.<br /><br />I can never get used to seeing things/Percy from other people's point of view.  And yes, there are chapters that were focused on Percy in the book, but the third person omniscient just never quite hit home with me.<br /><br />I feel like a stranger reading the books.  Like someone who just got into the series not long ago.<br /><br />I suppose if I picked up the series three years later than I did, I would definitely give the book six stars out of five.<br />But the lack of Percy's humor and strange, awesome antics in this book made me drop a star.<br /><br />Oh, don't worry, you all will definitely LOVE IT!  But if you're one of the die-hard fans, you'll start to see a pattern developing in his writing.<br /><br />BUY IT.  READ IT.  DEVOUR IT.<br /><br />You won't regret it, but in your head, maybe, just by a little bit, you'd hope that things ought to be better.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It's not the dramatic cliff hanger that some of his books are<br />But was a very pleasant read.
1451627289|5.0|Stunned.  Amazed.  Surprised.  Refreshed.<br /><br />I'm afraid that my limited vocabulary can not justify just how, how AWESOME this book was.<br /><br />I am a very reluctant reader on 'adult' genres.  The only thing I like to read are kids or teens book, which I am one.  But I was determined to seek for higher level and better books with new plots.  Something that I can read and learn something from.<br /><br />I was also reluctant because he is known as a writer for horror stories.  But this, wow, this books has the perfect amount of thrill in it to keep me going at all times, and definitely enough twists and turns to keep me interested.  That, ladies and gentleman, is very hard to achieve.<br />(Because I could have bet that I am ADHD.)<br /><br />I loved this book.  I devoured in three days, a personal record speed for reading.  Never was I so motivated.<br /><br />The history and the facts--I've learned more in this than in my History class!<br /><br />And the fantastic characterization--I gained a whole new insight on what great writers truly are.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|By far one of the best films I have ever watched. Charlize Theron simply made the film, no one, in my opinion, could have played her role better. Then through in Chris Hemsworth and the movie took on new heights. Even Kristen Stewart was not terrible. This is a must watch for everyone.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|And I didn't use llama finger quotes when I said that.<br /><br />The movie is hilarious, Warburton and Spade's deliveries are both beyond reproach.  Fun for parents and kids alike!
B006YXTRHY|4.0|As this movie series continues it seems as if everything gets better. With each new installment the acting, the graphics, and the script get better and come closer to the book. There were still some flaws, but over all it is better than the previous films.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Watched the movie first and have too say the book is far better! Can't wait to read the other two but just learned Amazon prime only let's me borrow one book a month... :-(
B000UJ48UO|1.0|One star rating is not for the movie. I like the movie, being an early 70's former Marine, 3rd Batt. Boot Camp and served with 2/5. I received the first copy and noticed a number of spots during playback that looked like someone had tried to unplug the video cable, it was just a brief bright flash and than normal play. I have other Blu-ray movies that play without problems. I returned the movie and another copy was quickly sent. The second copy arrived and the case did not have the normal stickers that need to be removed in order to open the case. The shrink wrap also did not look like it had been done at the factory, but by a kid with a hair dryer. Was this a returned copy?  I played the movie and it was worse than the first. I counted thirty spots where the movie had brief flashes which started in Boot Camp on the grinder. The flashes became worse after Tet in the movie, it looked like a colorized bar code. I requested a third copy ( this is how much I enjoy the movie) be sent and Amazon said no problem. One day later, Big Problem. In Amazon's words, &#34;I'm sorry to hear the replacement DVD had the same problem as your first order. This usually doesn't happen. Since it's likely another replacement would arrive defective, I won't trouble you with another replacement.&#34; Save yourself time and frustration and wait a few months, Amazon might get better copies of the movie.

1583334386|5.0|Why is it that we don't do the things we should be doing, and we end up doing the things we know will not help us in the long run? Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D. covers that very topic in her book The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do To Get More of It.  While it might sound like yet another self-improvement book, Willpower actually explains the \\"why\\" of how the brain works (backed by her experience with students in a course with the same name) and offers practical steps to implement in a ten week program.  It's already got me re-thinking on-the-spot decisions, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Welcome to Willpower 101; I Will, I Won't, I Want - What Willpower Is, and Why It Matters; The Willpower Instinct - Your Body Was Born to Resist Cheesecake; Too Tired to Resist - Why Self-Control Is Like a Muscle; Permission to Sin - Why Being Good Gives Us Permission to Be Bad; The Brain's Big Lie - Why We Mistake Wanting for Happiness; What the Hell - How Feeling Bad Leads to Giving In; Putting the Future on Sale - The Economics of Instant Gratification; Infected! Why Willpower is Contagious; Don't Read This Chapter - The Limits of \\"I Won't\\" Power; Final Thoughts; Acknowledgements; Notes<br /><br />The book is designed to be read much like you were in her course.  Reading one chapter a week allows you to think about the material as it applies to a goal you've chosen to work through.  The steps build on each other, and you end up with a good understanding about why you do the things you do, as well as techniques that help you overcome the failure triggers of the past.  Even the mere understanding of will-power, won't-power, and want-power is powerful enough to break you out of your mold. It certainly did for me...<br /><br />What also makes Willpower a great book is that McGonigal is a very good writer.  She mixes in science, reality, and humor in a way that makes it a fun read that doesn't feel like a normal self-improvement book.  The examples hit home in a deep way, and the phrase \\"I could take that step\\" went through my mind more than once.  Now that I've read through the entire book once (but not in the one-chapter-per-week model), I plan on re-reading it using the recommended approach.  With the overall concepts in place, I want to take each week's worth of material and apply it specifically.  The only hard part will be to choose what broken part to work on first...<br /><br />The annual rite of New Year's resolutions is coming up.  Rather than blow them all by January 4th, pick up a copy of The Willpower Instinct and put some structure behind your resolutions.  If you plug away, you'll be a far different person by March 1st, 2013 than you were on January 1st.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Freeement book.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is very useful for the Kindle publishing newbie. It covers the essential info needed to build a Kindle book for publishing. You may need to research a bit to learn to do more for your book AKA write more complicated code to tweak your files and build a more complex book. (Google \\"CJs Easy As Pie Kindle Tutorials\\" or Helen Hanson Kindle formatting).<br /><br />In general, this is a great simple and easy-to-use book to help an author quickly publish a novel or other text-heavy document to Kindle. Remember, though, beautifully formatting your Kindle book is an act of respect, regard, and caring for your reader. Learn what you need to in order to beautifully format your book for Kindle readers.
B00935UMX8|3.0|This work should have been called The Mediocre and Other Horrors.  The band is great.  The musicianship is great.  The only stand out track is &#34;Sinfonia&#34; which isn't even a metal track.  The rest of the tracks are so so.  My advice to Cradle is to get some new blood in song writing process.
B001BR5NH6|5.0|'Weird Science' is one of those hilarious 80s fabu John Hughes directed mind-candy flicks that is a frothy, good ride. I loved streaming this on Amazon. The great thing about streaming a movie is direct access to the experience without cluttering your life with stuff; streaming is clean, green and the ultimate entertainment online scene. This film offers a great chance to see early Bill Paxton acting (as big bother and big brother Chet Donnelly) as well as watch serious teenage cuties Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play average high school geeks who up their cool quotient and get their teenage lives together when they practice a little 'Weird Science.' I love Bill Paxton in [[ASIN:B001609SQA Aliens]], as Pvt. Hudson, as well. Kelly LeBrock, the woman they create, is beautiful, has impeccable timing, and makes this movie even more hilarious. At just 94 minutes, or so, the comedic fantasy film is an entertaining way to spend an hour or two. IF you love 'Frankenstein,' you'll probably really like this feature film.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|Bought as a gift person wanted movie, the person had the movie on Dvd and got a Blu-ray player and wanted it in Blu-ray.
1881273156|5.0|This book is an emotional read (I cried while reading the anecdotes of several of the couples who saw the author for therapy) yet it is also very practical. Developing a lexicon, or words, for love is an essential part of creating a conscious romantic relationship. My man and I got tremendous benefit from reading the book and discussing our &#34;love languages&#34; (and exploring whether or not we were doing a good job of speaking each others love language). My love languages are words of affirmation/loving words and loving attention (and acts of service also make me feel loved). My man, when first trying to guess my love languages, got them wrong at first: he thought gifts was #1 and I don't remember what his second guess was... but it was incorrect. What I learned about myself, in exploring whether or not I was speaking his love languages, was that I inadvertently projected my love languages onto him. So, I would give him attention, or say loving things/words of affirmation, but he really needed for me to show my love in other ways (acts of service, such as baking his favorite goodies, or frequent loving non-erotic touch). This book definitely enhanced our communication and increased our ability to speak each others love language. I expect that I will buy the Kindle edition as well.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|One thing I've learned: all professions have their own code, and people outside said profession probably don't grasp the realities.  Example: In 'Band of Brothers,&#34; Major Winters says, 'Only a combat soldier can judge another combat soldier.&#34;  Ergo, for honest review of this book, I'll defer to military sites that have reviewed.<br /><br />However, for what my opinion is worth, this book truly shows the hell of war.  The fear, stench, maggots, dead bodies, hunger, thirst.  When I was a kid, I played &#34;guns&#34; and watched war movies.  I never got &#34;it.&#34;  Books like this help me to get it.

1451638450|5.0|Having read every book Bujold has written, I didn't hesitate to grab the hardbound edition of Captain Vorpatril's Alliance as soon as it became available. I figured it would keep me well-occupied on a cross-country plane trip, which it surely did. The problem came about a quarter of the way into the book when I kept breaking out into uncontrollable laughter, which I was sometimes able to choke down into mild chortling. This provoked a bit of curious staring from other passengers on the flight, but since my own attention was concentrated on the book it didn't really concern me.<br /><br />I was originally leery about Bujold devoting a whole book to Ivan Vorpatril. It seemed a stretch to elevate him into a major character, and I half-expected that she'd have Miles Vorkosigan sweep in at some point to salvage the situation. WRONG! Bujold instead demonstrates what a brilliant writer she is, creating one of the cleverest and most enjoyable books in the series. As much as I like Miles, this proves that he doesn't have to always be the focal point of the Vorkosigan universe. There are lots of other stories still out there, which I devoutly hope Lois McMaster Bujold will tell to us in coming years.
030758836X|5.0|I'm only doing a quickie review of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn (no spoilers of course) because I read this book with the amazing Love at First Book Club participants during the month of November.<br /><br />Gone Girl was such a great book!  Literally I was being lied to the entire time by the characters, which was such a mind game, but also made the book amazing because I had NO idea what was going to happen!<br /><br />Now, the ending. . . well, a lot of my friends, ones who I value their bookish opinions, hated the ending.  But then a good number of people also enjoyed the ending.  I have to say that the ending is messed up.  But that made me love it!  It was so not Hollywood-like with the cheery, we all go home happy, that it was amazing.<br /><br />Whether you enjoy or hate the ending, I think that you will enjoy reading the book as a whole.  I also advise you to have a friend who has read it or is reading it at the same pace as you to communicate with throughout your reading of the novel.  Seriously, it's the only way I survived (thank you to Katie for all of our continuous texting back and forth).<br /><br />On a side note. . . the inside of the dust jacket is neon pink/orange and such a terrible distraction when reading.  I actually had to remove the dust jacket because I could not concentrate on the story!  But once I took it off, it was fine!<br /><br />Want more information on how people felt?  But please read at your own risk because spoilers are included on those links below!<br /><br />What thriller have you read that had you on the edge of your seat with its twists and turns?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book

B005NJU8PA|5.0|First of all, I've read 4HR Work and Body cover to cover. Both great reading and insightful as well. What I like is Tim's approach to simplifying things while achieving better results. The Slow Carb diet he writes about in 4HB has had real results for me. I'm still working principles in 4HWW as it applies to my one man business brand.<br />With that said, I was looking forward to 4HC. I was ready to hear how cooking can be simplified to winnable dishes ALL the time. I cook, I grill, I love it and the people I cook for really love the dishes. But I didn't understand the role and benefit of certain basic pieces; herbs, spices, cooking methods and coupling certain foods with slow carb sides. This book covers it well and adheres to the Slow Carb framework for fat loss. It is part HOW TO and part WHY TO. It gives you the philosophy behind simpler, hard to screw up dishes, less stressful evenings of entertaining with friends and more time to enjoy LIFE.<br />I highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys food, cooking with and entertaining friends, impressing high yield people (like beautiful woman or potential client/collaborators)<br /><br />I like Tim's curiosity in life, his dedication to simple living and his approach to getting it out there. Kudos to you TF.<br />And......B&N..........pity you don't see the inherent value this author brings to publishing and more importantly, the new book publishing paradigm. Instead of being silo'd, cross promotion of established brands and authors HELPS publishing as a WHOLE, with which you win in the end. But you won't get that and thus, you will become irrelevant sooner than you expect.

0452289963|1.0|I am not a follower of Oprah, her shows, or her selection in books. Not that I have anything against her at all, I just never got into that craze over her. So for all of you who see this and think &#34;well Oprah loved it, so maybe I will to..&#34; DO NOT BUY THIS. That is what I thought, and this book was terrible. First of all, the style of this writing is so all over the place, the majority of the time I had no idea what the author's point actually was. Several other times it put me in a sleep-induced coma. I read constantly; fiction, non-fiction, self-help, drama...about anything I can get my hands on. So for me to not even be able to get over halfway through this book is absurd, but I could not. It gave me no advice/suggestions/ideas of how to find my life's purpose. I am not desperately searching for a &#34;purpose&#34; though, so maybe, simply this book was just not for me.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|Spoiler alert (as though anything I write could spoil this cinematic debacle further than its creators already did).<br /><br />This was arguably the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. I borrowed the DVD from the public library, so all I wasted was time.<br /><br />Anyone who has even had a smattering of elementary physics will realize that the premise was downright silly: As a result of unusual solar activity, the level of neutrinos (a sub-atomic particle) reaching the earth greatly increases, and \\"mutate\\" into \\"something like microwaves\\", thus transforming the earth into a gigantic microwave oven, with the crust melting in many places and continents shifting thousands of miles.<br /><br />And all of this was predicted millennia ago by the Mayans. And happens every 640,000 years, also. How people and animals could have survived the earlier ones was not explained.<br /><br />The special effects were great but applied absurdly. The earth splits open and/or shoots fireballs, chasing the main characters at whatever speed they happen to be running, driving or flying away - a scenario repeated four times! Tsunamis cause waves thousands of feet high. An aircraft carrier at least ten times larger than life crushes the White House and half of Washington, DC. In a cheap name-dropping scene, an ark full of survivors lightly crashes into Mt. Everest.<br /><br />The movie does not even fulfill its promise that the world will end. Hundreds of thousands of \\"genetically chosen\\" (and/or moneyed) individuals survive the catastrophe, and after just one year afloat in their arks are ready to emerge to live happily ever after.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about this \\"disaster film\\" (the film is the disaster) is that I cracked up at the absurdity of the whole thing. If you must see it, borrow it, but don't waste your money buying it.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|some people say that it drains their battery or causes problems, but I haven't found anything wrong with it.

Daniel and the research he presents has revealed there's another way to go about work.

While I knew there was a big difference between the right and left hemispheres of the brain, much of this was new and a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />If you're interested in the changing dynamics in the work place, you'll want to snag a copy of this book. The insights are revealing while not being mind blowing.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers was quite possibly the best movie of the summer it came out. Great characters, fun story, fun action scenes, lots of humor, and a despicable villain.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|A lot has already been written about this, so I will keep it to bullet points:<br />- Great arrangements. The strings in lieu of keyboards is brilliant. Finally a way to strike a balance between Lifeson's guitar work and the cool layering that Lee does on synths, and it fits the theme very well.<br />- The lyrical repetition is either a bit too much or done well, depending on how much of a Rush nerd you are.<br />- The mixing and mastering job is every bit the mess that Vapor Trails was, which makes it fatiguing for repeated critical listening. Yet another album which I hope gets remixed and remastered in my lifetime. I'd have easily given this five stars otherwise.<br />- Everyone shines on this album but Neil's drumming just keeps getting better.<br />- I love the runic/steampunk thing but otherwise the album art is terrible.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Good plot, good acting, cool computer animation. Definitely watch this before The Avengers, as it builds up Tony Stark's character quite nicely.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|Slinky Thing<br />From the opening bars of Slinky thing I'm totally hooked : that unique hip hoppy syncopated bass line, can can only lead from 1 thang  to annuva ? Yo hav to move yo ass, but inna totally cool Kind a Blue sway.  Michael Leonhart's clavinet riff and Jon Herington's understated overdriven guitar provides the necessary lattice work to restrain de most troublesome of yah syncopated African undulations. The rest of the Leonhart family sweeten out with exquisite luscious soul harmonies;  Fagen wrapping  it in his signature horn pathos, and ripping blues vibes  :  His New Joirsey/Soprano twang forming the bitter sweet cerise atop of a meticulously constructed mise en gateau.<br /><br />L'histoire<br />I've been a fan of Donald Fagen for more time than I care to remember (Pretzel Logic - 1972 ) and  my faltering memory still flashbacks an aural landscape of cool funky pleasure and fun.<br /> Many critics (of some standing) have  thrown the faint praise of saccharine jazz/rock label at Fagen (Steely Dan), thus trying to mitigate his undoubted genius, in deference to their unsympathetic hack ignorance, of an educated blues/pop for grown ups.<br /><br />Sympathetic  Studies<br />From my own studies Fagen is the ultimate Professor of Black American Music Engineering. What this goovemeister doesn't no bout our music can be written onto a postage stamp: His ubermeister disciplines includes Country, Blues, R&B, Soul, Funk with an acolytic grasp of Jazz, syncopated arrangements & grooves.<br /><br /> Sho sum emotion<br />Emotion (soul or even optimism ) is not Fagen's forte, particularly vocally, but also psychologically. Concomitantly  his vocal short-comings have all too often being bitched about, by a  press corp who probably couldn't sing a note between them.<br />However he often transcends this with his knowing phrasing,  and the depth he gives to his lyrics and arrangements.<br />Fagen is a Jersey Jew, but this is only discernable through the bitter-sweet (Yiddish) convoluted lyricism ; A self confessed radiophile,  radio remains his eternal source  ... the music always sounds great on CD/Radio ( No static at all).<br />The early music has a distinctly pop aura, though Fagen specified that the original musicians for Steely Dan, should have jazz chops. On the back of this early success, Fagen moved on to a more jazzy blues driven music , which ended up pleasing the critics rather more than the public.<br /><br />I wan u 2 breakdown<br />As an artist Fagen has been plagued by a crippling self doubt: Originally he sought suffrage with Walter Becker (aka Steely Dan) , but he had such little confidence that he farmed out the original singing duties to  David  (Can't Buy a Thrill) Palmer. After the Gold teeth of Steely Dan , he duly suffered a dehabilitating creative block during the 80's where he didn't release any music.<br />Thankfully Fagen seems to have unblocked his Manipura, producing a set of solid solo albums, the most commercial being The NightFly, ; his homage to (his only childhood) New Jersey radio, and precocious  jazz fan autism.<br /><br />Back stories<br />The four albums are very different and thus seem almost experimental. On the NightFly he explores many genres ; Kamakiriad is his Star Wars ( which never quite works). I was quite jaundiced when I came to Morph the Cat which I initially dismissed a a back catalogue/contract/ Alice in Wonderland/mid life crisis Lewis Caroll homage. However repeated listening reveals an extremely mature/rounded character driven narrative fonk  (Mona's become a child of the night ...  things dont seem as dark when you're already dressed in black) ; the poignancy of his lyricism was always out punched by the gravitas of his more clever early musings, and technical peregrinations. But Sunken Condos are real stories, real middle aged fear and loathing wrapped in contemporary honeycomb of arrangements to die for ! If you want to compare and contrast take the Stones who are stillchasing teenage girls well into their dotage ... I believe this may not be totally legal let alone artistically valid?<br /><br />Connection<br />After a year of listening to Morph the Cat I was gaggin for Sunken Condos, and I felt I finally had another connection to this complex and humble genius.\\"What's to be done, to the weather in his head?\\"<br />Out of the Ghetto notwithstanding (he from Passiac? ) Sinkin Condos hangs together as a remarkable oeuvre from a yogi of contemporary American music.
B001LM1456|5.0|This version of The Incredible Hulk is the best of the recent Hulk movies. Edward Norton is great. Don't necessarily need to watch this before watching The Avengers.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Fortunately for Grisham he can really create prose that hooks his readers.  He can take the most mundane events and make them fun to read about.  Unfortunately he takes us down a lot of different paths that we believe will all come together at the end but he leaves a lot of loose ends.  I keep wondering why he introduces us to several characters.  But in his defense it was still a wonderful read and I'll continue to read his stuff.

1906735875|5.0|I almost wept when I heard that Rebellion (the current owner of 2000 A.D. and Dredd) was making plans to bring Dredd back stateside, something that we haven't had the privilege to experience since the late 90's when DC and Fleetway/Quality owned him. The Stallone movie, was of course, the catalyst in this. Almost taking kind of an Adam West Batman approach to the entire legacy that the franchise had built upon itself. Most people were unfamiliar with the comic and didn't even know there was one regardless of all the stacks of four panel pages in the opening with his name on it, so they just saw it as a very lame attempt to cash in.<br /><br />If you are reading this as a curious viewer of the new Karl Urban Dredd movie and are considering delving into this 1984 styled Republican wet dream of fascism incarnate, you are making a sound investment with your legal tender by purchasing this. But be careful, the nerd bug that you will catch from flipping through this beautifully restored pages is infectious and will be as merciless with your wallet as Dredd is with the law. Now the book itself contains individual short stories, usually running five to six pages long, that were run in the weekly sci-fi anthology comic 2000 A.D. and were in black and white (save for a few pages in a random comic, much like Weekly Shonen Jump) up until Prog 723 (March 1991); so not much is being lost on the eyes of a newer reader. But if you grew up with the color reprints of the Eagle comics run, it may be a bit tough to slog through at first.<br /><br />I say this because Brian Bolland's artwork BEGS to be in full spread color. I have drooled all over his insanely detailed and crisp pencilings many a time and seeing his work slathered in paint draws you in all that much more, especially in Judge Dredd #3, with the reappearance of the Dark Judges.<br /><br />But enough minor gripes, I cannot say enough good things about this book and I am pleased as punch that it actually sold out for a timeaccording to Rebellion's twitter. So it obviously means that they're doing something right regardless of the fact that the new film did poorly at the box office.
B001TH16DI|4.0|You're only here because you're a Star Trek fan and you want these movies on blu-ray.  The video quality is great on all of the movies, and you get the commentaries from the dvds plus some new ones.  You also get a disc with new material and interviews.  Missing:  The text commentary tracks from the Okudas.  Those were a big part of why I loved the dvds.  The Motion Picture is the theatrical version, not the directors cut.  That means that there are no updated visuals like there are in that version, and a few scenes are cut/different.  So, if you buy this, don't throw away that dvd.  The menus on these discs suck, they are not as clever or beautiful as the ones on the dvd collection from a few years ago.  Every disc has trailers that are near impossible to skip.  You'll get so tired of the trailer for the new JJ Abrams Star Trek movie.  The Wrath of Khan is curiously the directors version that came to dvd, so you get the annoying Preston scene.  Save your old Wrath of Khan dvd (the first one, not the directors edition) if you want the best quality of the theatrical version.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Pretty good old school arcade style game that works well with my HTC EVO. On normal use it's a short game with 20 levels, but difficult. The boss at the end will make you cuss at your phone. Took a lot of dying and frustration. I'm glad its over so I give it 4 stars for the addiction until the end.
B00881VLCE|1.0|my downloaded puzzles just got taken away from my app for no reason???  That is bunk.  This WAS my favorite app tip now.  Thanks a lot.
B003L20IHO|5.0|I'm a movie nut and I just love watching great movies. This movie is one of the greats, sometimes you have to enjoy the low budget films. I like the emotion that resonates from the characters and how you can connect with them. To lose a loved one has a great impact on the heart, and Zac Efron shows this sadness realisticaly in the movie. I too have lost loved ones, but I think losing a sibling would have a much harsher effect on a person.

B009RX8MQ0|5.0|This show is such a breakout. It is compelling and gasp-worthy every episode. The writing is so rich and the actors have completely given themselves over to it. Not to mention how beautiful the people and the setting and the wardrobe are. It compliments the viewer's ability to put details together and anticipate connections while keeping this dark, mysterious thread going and going. \\"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves\\" is how this show starts. And it IS to die for.

B004QK5N5W|3.0|This is the oddest thing but I bought this adapter from Amazon so I could watch Amazon videos on my HD TV<br />I read that it mirrors the Ipad 2 which I have, and on which I have the Amazon video app.<br />Welll to my surprise it does not transmit picture to my TV via the HDMI connection.<br />So it seems very ironic that Amazon sells a product which cant actually be used with its Prime video selection.<br />I wish someone could explain it as Netflix easily connects and can be watched on my TV.<br />To be honest, no one really wants to be restricted to watching quality movies on a small screen when you can just as easily watch on the big screen via Netflix for example.<br />Its a great flaw in Amazon video and should be mentioned before purchasing this item.<br />This is a good adapter but I would caution....with limitations!!!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|From what I watched so far this season lives up to last season. Looking forward to watching the remaining episodes.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The animation was excellent.  The story was good. It was humourous, and had unexcpected turns.  Heroine was someone easy to relate to.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The Honda Civic of automatic watches! Love it. I purchased a nicer band but otherwise love it. . . .
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I liked it.  Somewhat different than Casino Royale but still plenty of action.  Skyfall puts Daniel up there with Sean.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|it is a combination hidden objects plus puzzles and adventure. I loved it. played for hours without wanting to stop.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it. it's the best app I have we all need to live by God's word!! Jesus loves each of us
