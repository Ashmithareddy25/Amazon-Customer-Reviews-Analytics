B00T89J4LU|5|Excellent purchase!
B008BYPFCK|5|good
B009L3C9TM|5|it speaks for itself, and it is pretty sticky.......
B000ET5TH6|5|Great performance and gas mileage increased. These are great plugs.
B00AJTEERC|3|Very good products
B00GHOH4UM|5|Nice solid race gas can, the other reviewer that had issues with the vent leaking was just using the thing wrong, all you have to do is crack open the vent and pour, and it wont leak. Also closes up tight so you don't get your non-race car stinking of gas, which is a nice bonus.
B00ISF6N3M|4|It was a little misleading on what exactly it was. When it arrived I guess I was surprised to find out it was only a leather cover with elastic banding. I was under the impression it was the actual hard top unit. Once installed though it turned out to be just fine. In fact having it so easily removable makes it easy to clean
B002OPYVYU|5|so far so good.
B00X6FL8ZW|5|its nice quality
B00BLAG3D6|5|Bought it for my friend he's a volunteer fd guy and it works for him for a huge fraction of the price of weilend lights
B000TK8N1O|5|awesome wheel light right up
B00A5294T6|5|As described arrived on time..
B00C6N0K4A|5|Perfect fit on a 1999 Forester. Firmed up the ride and steering at a much lower price than OEM parts.
B00KMUEFIQ|5|Quiet stops great and low dust . Definitely worth the money .
B0055408GC|4|I installed these filters for a modification done to my airbox.<br />The bike performs well with these.<br />I would not recommend them if you ride in places with dust storms. In a recent trip I road through desert like areas and found fine dust inside my airbox.
B003VXRPL0|4|Not blue anymore
B0009H51U8|2|Barley fits and took a lot of extra effort.  I was ready to give up untill I read a review.  It takes a lot of effort but eventually you can make it fit.
B0002SQYUA|5|This is a quality product that has already saved me more than it cost, especially like the switch to change it to a low pressure tester, found a few vacuum leaks that way when I put soapy water on the vacuum tubes
B00RBQ6HS0|5|great deal
B00R26RCVK|5|I bought this to cover my seats after I workout.  It does the trick.  Keeps my seat dry.  Also dries pretty quickly itself.  I leave it on my seat full time.
B0096QA04A|5|Just what I wanted ... and like the pink lettering (I was a female firefighter.)
B005CRFKQA|4|It was great other than a little long
B00EFAS9KO|4|Nice frame...
B007H8DKJG|3|My 2002 chevy tahoe was showing knock sensors on the computer replaced them and the wiring harness and its still showing. Not sure it is the parts or something else wrong with it.
B00418U0AM|5|Love the sticker I really  recommend
B009VTIX5K|3|Okay
B00IVIQ6BA|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT TOTALLY RECOMENDED
B00GHT6SF4|5|Great fit !
B0050W3FZK|3|Very hard to clean and keep clean
B00B4KUDPW|5|Great Quality, excellent price.  Thank you
B00NWO1SF2|5|I have had these factory rubber mats for almost a year. No wear or tear of any kind so far. it still looks pretty new.<br />The carpeted floor mats had to be removed in order for these rubber mats to fit without getting stuck with pedals.
B0073MF7L0|5|Great fit in 90s Chevy trucks great heavy duty cooling amazing strong construction couldn't be happier. And it also doesn't look half bad under the hood haha
B00881EQ1C|2|Where are the screws?<br /><br />&#34;SCREWS ARE INCLUDED<br />We include (4) # 12 x 1 inch long screws with every order of flexyframe LD.&#34;<br /><br />2 stars for not including screws.  Will edit if necessary.
B00DR03GTC|5|🙌🏽👌🏽
B003OXUPOQ|5|Genius idea!  I hope to add to my other vehicles.
B00B63DVJW|5|Awesome!
B00BQN5OX8|4|These work perfectly and are very easy to replace. It took all of 5 minutes to do both sides, and the instructions on the carton are easy to follow.<br />Its a good idea to have a friend hold the liftgate up when you replace the pistons (one at a time), to avoid getting knocked on the head by the tailgate.<br /> These would warrant a 5 star rating, but since they are smaller in diameter than the OEM lifts, I am assuming they might not last as long as my originals (they lasted 10 years). Nonetheless, they are a fraction of the cost of the OEM pistons, and they work just as well, so I have no complaints.
B003276ZAW|5|Perfect fit. Look just like the OEM mats.
B000ALIS9E|4|used a pair on my 2006 prius. the pair is so strong that it lifts the hatchback by themselves. only drawback is having to pull it back down.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|+++++  GREAT TO HAVE A COMPLETE AND VERY REASONABLE MINI FUSE ASSORTMENT.  A LOT OF VALUE FOR THE MONEY CONSIDERING WHAT YOU PAY FOR A BOX OF FIVE.  THANK YOU,  gene  +++++
B004BH76V4|5|Glad I got this to keep my car alot cooler in the sunshine!  It does make a difference.
B000BQR100|1|Does not fold up anymore after two weeks of use.  Seems like the frame of the shade is alrady deteriorating.  Going in the trash.
B002XM592M|5|GOOD SOLUTION FOR DIFFERENT STYLE LATCHES THAT DO NOT LAST.
B00Y7BLCQO|4|It's nice but on the smaller side. It didn't cover up the last bumper sticker that  deteriorated from the outdoor elements.<br />So the text is small too. Have to be up pretty close to read it.
B000FGI34E|4|It works and fits in our 2010 Corolla XRS and 2009 Matrix. Maybe a little noticeable gain in power, but nothing significant. It is an oil filter, and if I could go back in time and buy a different one, I would've gone with a dry filter. I haven't had any problems with the oil messing up the O2 sensor, it is just messy when you clean it.
B00GVGFEJ4|1|This is a very cool looking keychain and very solid however the &#34;spinner thing&#34; in the middle is attached via a screw and after a few spins simply falls out, leaving you with an expensive bottle opener. Mine came out twice - the second time in a field and is now gone forever. Too bad because it could be a good product with some slight design changes.
B003CEFJ2U|5|Perfect
B004SRK6Q4|5|It fits just as it should
B00RIV1H42|5|Fits the BMW 325xi perfectly! Everything lined up. Also included the screws, others didn't! Received quickly with 2-day shipping.
B002J8379C|5|I have used these pads for years, and they work very well.
B001LTTSXY|1|Don't waste your money. I have had to replace this part every 6 months for the last year and a half. Not a quality part. You will waste your time and labor on a part that repeatedly fails. Spend the extra money on a quality part and do the work once.
B0002SRGXY|5|OTC quality, good price. It's a shame that I had to buy the Chrysler adapter kit (OTC 7894) separately, but such is life.
B00C2NSBUY|5|pecise fit
B00G3H9MGC|5|Love it!
B008YFTJTG|5|Product works great very bright and lights up everything on road
B00TPXG0NO|1|Does not fit 2015 Tacoma.  After I put the lock on I pulled on the tailgate twice and it came right off.  My order did not come with the spacer as shown in picture.  Don't buy it!
B009G8GX9Y|5|Love squash sent and it did its job. smelled great lasted for a month or so.
B00KTIUG5C|5|easy programming and can be program to more than one car at a time
B005ZVIF6A|5|Excellent product. Looks great!
B0002NYDRG|5|You can always count on Lisle to build a great tool.  I purchased this to work on the rear brakes of Honda.  Honda brakes have two Phillips head screws, which over time, end up being rusty.  This tool helps to get these screws out of the rotors.
B00DZUDCFC|5|These are actually 2.5&#34; spacers and I put them on my 94 suburban it's lifted 6&#34; with 35s on it and my rims were only slightly off set and adding these gave me the look I was looking for couldn't be happier
B000IYUBIO|4|Not quite as good as the OE rotors but much better than the cheapie Chinese.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|“This worked! Had latex paint stain on brown leather club<br />chair. Tried using virgin olive oil as recommended on line but that did not<br />work. This did the trick, stain is gone, chair looks like new again.”
B00LVYRW82|5|Easy to install,  perfect for my old boat trailer.
B00IT8D0M0|5|This cloth dries the window streak free.  My daughter and I did all her windows in her house and it didn't take very long.  We just used a Norwex cloth and water.
B000CQTKE4|5|These are one of my favorite pads, they never come back with noise issues and last a lot longer than others I use.  Very low dust levels too.
B00BOTISTQ|1|I read the reviews that said these would fit a 2011 Kia Sorento without a sunroof. I ordered them and they do not fit the opening for the bars to clamp on to is too small. I have requested return shipping.
B00PX0A674|5|Arrived on time. they are heavy duty very well made. Shipping was a little pricey due to the weight of them but still a good buy.
B000EDUUIA|5|Keep it simple. This works great.
B000CPCC4U|5|Look like they should work very well. The spring tension seems fine. I got them started strait and pounded in with a 2 pound hammer and a old piece of wood trim. No problems.
B0031I3TN8|5|Looks, works and fits great!
B000C2S96I|5|Perfect fit!
B000CRZXPI|5|5 stars
B00842QJVA|5|Love my new SUV cover, fits my Cadillac SRX perfectly.
B0045DY8ZG|5|Everything fits perfeftly
B006LRMEIC|5|It's great.  Nice upgrade from stock.
B000182DW4|4|Good product,looks great, functions well.
B003A8D6YG|5|Good looking sticky mat for your dash. I have two of these. They work great and last a long time.
B00AYXM4DY|3|Not what I thought. Lot of work to get it correct
B00EA8CK7O|5|I love it!! Just what my car needed! Just a small amount of bling!! 💕
B00HCOR8UW|5|Looks perfect, but does not fit my 1G DSM.
B00BTLEIIY|1|it only includes  2 rear seat covers, 3 headrest covers which is different with description.
B00QW2WKC6|4|Pretty cool magnet and fair delivery time. Only I expected it to be a printed magnet. These are just a piece of magnet with a regular bumper sticker adhered to it. Not a big deal. Looks great on the back of my blazer. Keep showing your pride folks!!
B009S00IWS|5|Fit my  vstar 650 custom with no modification I am a happy camper
B003MUSM9Q|5|Great price and fast delivery
B005QN4IBI|5|SIMPLY THE BEST not oily doesn't collect dust like the other brand
B004HEBN1A|3|When on top of my vehicle n not being used it makes a lot of noise. Sounds like it's loose. Be careful on how you put it because the screws go down and can scratch the vehicle
B0087PE682|5|Beefy thick steel.  Exactly what i was in search of.  I am making a removable fence panel with these.  Thank you!
B001J85CGY|4|so far the are excellent to new to truly test
B007CNB5W0|5|As soon as I installed it, it worked
B000HEA13U|5|Amazingly affordable go fast parts. Ordered for my 1980 VW Scirocco and it fit perfect into the stock oil filter housing!!!!
B00AWO6H2O|5|Installed on a 2013 CX-5. Very easy install.
B00KLE542Y|3|Starting to peel... sadly.. I bought it about half a year ago D:
B003IS3HV0|4|On time and as advertised.  Thank you!  :-D
B00Q1F8LKY|5|Perfect fit
B0091U4T9I|5|Installed on a 2013 CX-5. Very easy install.
B004SSAFUK|5|76 rivera, big long car and fits perfectly
B00H7XFQOI|5|Very please with the four tire Prosche wheel center covers for my 911
B00AWDV7PM|5|Beautiful!  And Perfect!
B001JT14SI|5|does what it needs to do.
B000MBNNJM|4|Fits good.
B00L7XED16|5|very pleased with product
B000CO7E6W|1|Broke a couple hours after installed... I didn't even use it after I put it on after I tried it and made sure it worked.
B009Y7MJVS|4|Does what it is suppose to do.  Holds the toll pass.  does not fall off
B005HWTGQU|4|Nice and easy to install
B0059ACZLI|2|Nice gift to give.
B00008RW9U|5|and My husband loves it, too
B00OB6B4WW|5|This pad is perfect for our new jeep. I like the extra leather section to protect the bumper when putting in heaving objects and beach chairs! Just remove it and shake out the sand and dirt and it looks brand new again.
B001T2U2DS|3|The Hood Release Strap was for my C230 and although looks nice, I had to install it backwards as the bump on the top of the strap does not allow for the hood to open.
B00G258I0G|5|Works great for the motorhome
B00N7C2O6G|2|We needed these for our RV. They didn't work as expected. Haven't yet used them for another application. Ended up going to the auto parts store to get the needed lights.
B00AVNJPIO|5|I was contacted by there staff immediately after I was not satisfied with the product. They remix a new batch and had it sent direct to me all free of charge. That type of attribute makes them high end by my standards. I was impressed and color matched wonderfully. To stand by your product like that in today's world of throw away culture is harder and harder to find. Thank you Ryan and the rest of the staff at the bumper store😀
B00CFJT6AE|5|This fixed my car and some of its codes<br />Fast shipping and the price was just right
B00JA3BMDW|3|This product i received from Tomoson complimentary and oh boy I actually like this product! To my surprise it came with a battery and it is very easy to use. I compared this reading to an under the tongue thermometer and it was the same! All in all for the price, i would totaly buy if mine breaks.
B003VB0YYC|5|works well, well made
B007VLFA4M|5|Price was unbelievably low...with free shipping too.  Replaced (last Fall) the dim incandescent bulb in my Corolla Trunk.  What a difference it makes.  It outputs enough light at night to brighten up the entire area around the trunk.  I taped the unit to a trunk metal ceiling strip, and protected it with the plastic &#34;dome&#34; from packaging that covered something thin on a piece of cardboard.<br /><br />Warning: I thought the unit was dead, but in fact the factory had put the 2 contact wires down the wrong sides of the bayonet plug-in.  I was glad they didn’t break when I bent them over to the correct side, and then they worked.
B00HJ6P562|5|These center caps fit great on the back pro comp steel wheels.
B000BZZEW8|4|Great product! Thanks
B00HMYIEGY|5|Just the ticket for my LED lights
B00XIMNDGA|5|Made out of a rubberized material so it has a little flex to it. That was exactly what I was looking for instead of the more common plastic ones on here.
B0009JKGKQ|5|Good air tool oil!
B008MISDH4|5|My bike is happy. (08 CBR600rr)
B00L2QM806|4|I can tell you that I am a real person leaving a real review.<br />The shades that I received were to be used in my car for my daughters window because she hates fighting with the sun. So far I like the product. It came in the mail with 2 shades and the suction cups to attach it to the window. I will say that the suction cups were pointless in my Honda civic window. the shades are bendable so they will actually stay in the window if you tuck the top/bottom into the window top and bottom of the window it stays with no problem. This works for me because I only use one for my daughters window and then on long drives when its sunny I can grab the other shade that stays tucked between my drivers seat and the center console and I can put it up on my window and not have to almost crash trying to figure out the suction cup.<br /><br />Quality: 9/10 Only because the suction cups aren't really needed with my Honda windows. They may be needed in a SUV or truck window since they are bigger<br />Functionality: 10/10
B00HLSJSK2|3|Would give the Gorilla lock lugs 5 stars, but Gorilla Automotive lists the 2012-2015 Ram 1500 truck lugs as 14mm x 2.0. Had to return and order 14mm x 1.5 lugs which is the correct size for the application.
B003YMTJ94|5|Great brake rotors that fit and perform as good as the original equipment parts.
B005DSS4PC|1|This is NOT a BMW Factory OEM product and not near the quality of the factory item.
B000GZSVL4|5|Great price!!!! Helmet fits great.
B005XRQNRO|5|These are a very nice, and affordable replacement for the OEM assemblies. Adds a unique touch that stands out from your typical stock 4th gen Eclipse, while remaining simple to install with a few basic tools and a free afternoon.<br /><br />The black housing is pretty glossy. It looks smooth, and all the edges are flush and sealed properly. Both sides fit in exactly as the stock units did and all in all the process only took about 1-1.5 hours of work at a relaxed pace, and I am by no means a pro mechanic. Keep in mind you will be removing the front bumper and there are no instructions, so man up. (I found it easiest to lift the front end up onto jack stands and do it all like that. Some people remove the front wheels, I couldn't see any advantage to doing that once the car is already on stands because the suspension drops quite a bit leaving plenty of room.)
B00E1SNYFK|5|They do their job and half the OEM part price..
B000E8T83S|5|No brainer for my MGB.  I use Purolator in most of my vehicles.  Good quality and I love the coarse finish.  Very easy to spin on and off.
B00CFXW1AM|5|Replaced the halogen projectors in my Spyder headlights on my F150 with these Morimoto knick-offs. These projectors are infinitly better with the HID bulbs I installed. Great cut off and project very far. Extremely bright high beam too. These are well worth $30.
B0040CZ7PM|5|Work great! Just be sure you order the right ones, I did and they work great!
B00E203PF6|5|good product
B00IM9AGUA|4|Excellent helmet. Excellent styling. Excellent value.
B006GJMSRC|5|My 2014 Jeep unlimited was sitting lower in the rear after I installed my ACE bumper tire carrier combo and 35&#34; tire. These spacers fit on top of your stock dampener and perfect leveled out my jeep. And as with all Rubicon Express gear great quality.
B00NE33KES|5|Perfect fit for my 2009 BMW X6 and at substantial savings over the stealership pricing. I have high and low beams at a much brighter temp than stock. I only needed one, but the color difference meant I had to change both. I'll definitely buy again if needed.
B000EVYGQY|1|I checked Innova's ABS supported vehicles on their website before purchasing this.  It clearly states that the 3030 supports ABS in a Dodge Challenger 2011-2012.  I have a 2011.  The ABS light was on.  I needed to know which sensor was bad or what else the problem was.<br /><br />I plug in the Innova 3030 and it shows 0 DTCs which was correct so I push the down arrow to get to ABS and it says noSUP.  I contact Innova and they tried to tell me the vehicle wasn't reporting any ABS modules and I should wait longer and try again, etc.  No luck.<br /><br />I was talking to a friend and he said he had a Harbor Freight OBD II device that would do ABS.  I went to his place and plugged it up.  It read the ABS no problem.  The right front ABS wheel speed sensor was not reporting properly.  I bought a new sensor for $15, it arrived today, I installed it and the ABS light immediately went off.  I then plugged in the Innova 3030 and it still reports noSUP.<br /><br />I also hate the interface on this device as well along with the web interface.<br /><br />I tried it in my 2002 Ram 1500 Truck and it took about 45 seconds to read the modules.  It finally came back with 0 DTCs which was correct and 0 ABS which was correct.  I simulated an ABS problem by pulling a fuse and it detected that properly.<br /><br />I made a USB based OBD II reader that uses software on a laptop and it hooks up to the modules in my truck almost instantly as does my non ABS Harbor Freight scanner.<br /><br />I bought this 3030 to keep from having to go to the dealer for diagnostics and spend a lot of money potentially on a $10 part ($15 with shipping) as the car is out of warranty.  It was relatively inexpensive and I didn't want to go buy 4 new sensors and hope one was bad only to find it was something else.<br /><br />I'm sure this works great for other vehicles but if you say it works with a certain year, make and model car, it sure as better work!
B0031BDT7G|5|Product looks amazing
B00NVVA7HG|5|Just as advertised.
B00CI8XPFY|5|Great sticker in support  of an excellent film studio. I get many comments on it. Easy to apply.
B00WMK3O7W|5|They were awesome best fit the back one fit just fine I like the material at home
B000ALG1NY|4|It works, but it's pretty cheaply made.
B00AAGOPGO|3|Seems to work good but apparently is made for big heads, i have to modify mine to stay on, so unless youve got a mega melon it wont fit right.
B00T62RK1U|5|put them on my atv, two in front and two in back, gonna order more for my truck.
B00QMZ8DHY|1|china s***
B008IEVQGW|4|It has fixed the jerking when switching gears but need to see how long it.will last
B003CE283I|5|Love it.  No more large wooden blocks to carry. No worry of bugs in the wood.  Wish we had one years ago.
B000JZAWTA|5|Many of the Ford C/V's used this Bosch unit as the OE pump.  The one I purchased replaces a Chinese Airtex that was leaking through the wiring loom that the customer had someone else install a couple of years earlier.  Well worth a little more for this unit.
B00KTJ1PLU|5|VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !!
B00IKJ8HH6|5|very good and fast service would order again
B0009OMYAQ|5|5 star
B00HO17YKW|5|Perfect fit! Nice product
B004I0HFQK|5|As advertised
B001L9KI56|5|One of the best products I've purchased. Thanks for a great product with fast shipping.
B000066OC7|1|It was terrible.  Flattened out in no time.
B000C9RXWC|3|High quality parts from AC Delco. Unfortunately I only received 3 of 4 of the bolts in the box and my return options are either to wait for UPS to pick it up when I should be at work... or I can pay to ship back a $7 set of hardware... I'm going to trust that one of old rusty bolts will hold up in place of the one I should've got with this package.  Overall this is the ONLY bad experience I've ever had with amazon.  I didn't figure they'd ask me to pay to ship their incomplete parts back to them... since I'm at work on a business day like a normal person and can't have the parts picked up by UPS because I won't be available.
B000BXME7I|5|Perfect size for me to change my oil on my Honda Goldwing motorcycle.  Motorcycles are built close to the ground.  The clearance is only about 6 inches.  This oil pan clears everything by about an inch.  Has a pour spout that does not drip.  I save a gallon jug of milk.  With a funnel I can easily pour the used oil into the gallon jug.  Then I take the used oil to Walmart for proper disposal.  Walmart does not charge a disposal fee.
B001ESUOOY|5|I bought a pair of these and they arrived May 28th 2015. I use these with my small off road travel trailer that I bought for back country camping because the fresh water tank only holds 10 gallons unlike the 70 gallon tank on my motorhome.  The cap has a cover that flips down over the spout to keep it clean when the spout is stored inside the jug and flips up when the spout is turned out for use.  I did modify mine to eliminate the air venting problem others mention.  I bought a 5 pack of plastic, snap close air vents that most containers have ($3.50 on eBay), drilled a 1/2 inch hole in the top (between the two handles opposite the pour spout), pushed the vent cap in and it works great with no leaks.  I also removed the worthless black plug in the vent tube in the spout so that more water could flow through. These are a good size. When full I can carry one in each hand to be balanced and the double handle makes it easy to pour when refilling the fresh water tank one my travel trailer.  If using it to pour into an opening on a vertical surface turn the spout so it points up instead of forward so that you can tip it high enough to empty it at the end.  These are heavy duty enough to  handle the jarring they get on the back country dirt roads and trails that I traverse with my 4wd and trailer.  Overall they are very good and if they came with the vents without me have to modify them they would be great.  I would give it 41/2 stars because of this if I could but it is so easy to fix I didn't want to ding it a whole star. It literally took less than 5 minutes total to fix both of them.
B004SSEOQG|5|As described, use it every day at work.  However, shipping does take a while............I mean a while. So long, I forgot I ordered it!
B000E28C7M|5|These are great filters for my Harley Davidson. I just received three more of them. This will be my source for filters from now on.
B00X65LGNQ|4|Helmet seems like it is a lot slimer than others I've seen.<br />All in all it seems like a great helmet especially for the price, fairly light weight and good padding for comfort. Just was not quite the right look for my taste!
B00KTIUG5C|5|worked great!
B00DUV1T7Y|4|Fits as it should. I like the idea of not overpaying for filters. Bosch is USA made and put over 310,000 miles on my toyota using only these Bosch filters. Why pay more?
B006H34BUY|5|I bought this to for my car and use it all the time to dust off the dashboard. I think it was a good purchase!
B00WJVBKG6|3|The brake peddle cover appears to be of a decent quality, however it does not fit my bike. I have a Honda Shadow 750 ACE. The add had Shadow 750 listed as compatible. I do not know about how it is on a bike.
B003AUZBEC|4|Tubes where shorter than original,but was very easy to install and works great
B00E7IKR3Q|5|Perfect! All yall really need to do is offer a single door handle for the drivers door that has no key hole! Some body broke into my truck and I solved all of my problems with a little help from yall.
B007TG7I0I|5|Still on
B009QRWHZO|5|Very durable and easy to install.
B00GXRFOSW|5|Great product. Can't beat the looks and price<br />I would definitely buy from this supplier again. They responded to my concerns immediately. From now on I will look to them for my purchases
B005PZMKZI|4|everything was good except i though the covers would be a little heavier
B00EKTJEW2|3|Nice looking handle cover however, the double sided tape was not enough to hold this in place upon first application. Handle had to be removed and reapplied with new tape to firmly hold in place. Otherwise it's a nice product.
B00KIERDDU|5|Extremely Bright, high quality. I definitely need some more.
B009DJQS8M|1|YOU SENT ME THE OXYGEN SENSOR GENERIC,  NOT ORIGINAL, IT'S A DISASTER.<br />THIS PART IS NOT FOR MY HONDA CRV
B00J9V3JXG|4|Wish it was either a little longer or a little shorter for my purpose but it works
B00NOG0PNO|5|I off road and love the extra light bought every brand you can think of this passes all of them the construction and quality of this light is amazing for the price
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Did not fit my truck
B000S2UG8G|1|Need to return wrong set. When i picked this set of wire I was shown parts that would fit my truck so don't know how I pick the wrong set??? I was looking at price more
B000GKD5NI|3|This worked great when it worked.  I've had this for 2.5 months now and the suction cups no longer stick to the window so I can't use it anymore.
B006X6M4WW|1|Looks horrible
B00C873Y60|5|Good price.  Shipped quickly.
B00IEIFPKA|3|I love the material its not itchy at all... Which I was kind of expecting. Fit my 2003 VW beetle well a little big in some areas but nothing bad. Kinda disapointed mine came with 5 head rests instead of a steering wheel cover and shoulder pads but im pretty sure walmart seels the same print.
B000Z0HVHA|4|No complaints, works fine for my application
B004IV58AY|5|Always use it to reset my mother in law's computer.  (Some benign sensor that keeps tripping).  Its a little hard to connect due to the odd location under the dash, I even bent a few pins that had to be straightened.  However once connected, it works every time.  Good price.
B001THV9D0|5|Little goes a long way!  Applied a coat over a month ago and rims look factory fresh still!
B000HYOUSC|5|Perfect fit - I Used included adapter and it fit just fine.in my Suburban water heater  -  Love the drain. Great value.
B0060KKJ6Y|5|good
B006H34BUY|5|Works well and fits in door pocket nicely
B0002U2V1Y|2|too expensive for clay
B00G620ZVU|5|Super fast shipping. Product perfect!!!
B00LEBLI82|5|I changed out 21 bulbs in my year 2000 camper.  What a difference with no added heat and white light rather than yellow tinge.
B00BCRMA9Y|1|Said that it would fit my car & didn't
B007V2BSG0|5|Fits my 2008 Toyota Tundra perfectly. It is good quality material, and it will block direct sunlight from entering your windshield.
B005A8JDG4|5|It's exactly what I needed and much, much less than if I bought it at a dealership parts dept
B000PD70KU|1|did not fit the corners  with grooves  without the tape I  wouldn't have  been able to use them.... hope they hold thru our winters for next years endeavors
B003FADK7C|5|Fits perfectly
B000VLF940|4|Great durable material. Mostly easy to fit, but not crazy about the header rail design (see my review on that) Make sure to readjust the top a few times when it gets some good sun on it. The new top will definitely stretch when heated, and tightening it when hot will help it break in and maintain a good snug, no flap fit.
B00BJEZEL6|3|Quick delivery but incorrect part
B00MJEP8TS|5|Go company I'll recommend it to my friends and family will definitely buy again
B000C18Q4Y|5|No problems. Works good.
B0044A3YAA|5|Good part, fit perfect on my audi a6.<br />Happy buyer:)
B000C2EDLI|5|Well made.  A bit tricky to install because the oil pan cannot be removed unless you pull the engine.  I raised the engine a few inches, dropped the oil pan, removed the old gasket, cleaned the surfaces, threaded in the new gasket (getting it under and around the oil pump is the hard part), and bolted it back up.
B013WEPTYC|5|Ended up working pretty well. I do road course racing and brake fluid can be changed on my car as many as 4 times a year. This makes it not only easier because I can do it myself with minimal monitoring, I can do half the car as it sits on the ground.
B000C5I6H2|5|Came in handy when replacing handles or locks.
B000COBC38|5|Expensive but I had to have them!
B00QAQCD5S|5|Looks and fits great just make sure u put pads down that are given to you
B00LM56920|4|nice..2 strips last for 25 days..good smell
B004107292|3|Use this to get a bit more water out of the fountain to clean it.  Doesn't get it all but more than if I didn't have it.
B00PTFBXSE|5|If this agm bat lasts as long as advertised it will be worth the extra cost.
B0041RWKUQ|5|No problems
B00ANAMBJU|5|Great buy!  Made my vacation a breeze.
B0097N08XK|4|Could have fit better but for the price I can't comain
B00OQP869M|1|Both bulbs are dead on arrival. Tried two sources of power supply and still no luck!  Too bad.
B00DCXIJJG|5|So far so good. Fit just a little more snugly than the OEM battery in my 09 350 Raptor. More CCA, stronger starting power, pounds less weight. Can't go wrong. Unlike traditional batteries that wear down and will still allow you to crank the starter even if there is not enough juice to start, these Lithium ion batteries don't let you crank if they fall below 10v so it prevents you from damaging your starter and from draining the battery into low enough volts where it does the battery damage. It's all or nothing which I like. No half dead battery false hopes lol.
B003RY53U8|5|Use them everyday
B00CWSK6E8|5|a great deal.  got the front and rear brakes for half the price the front brakes were going to cost from the dealer.  fyi, the springs are not included.
B00L5R2MRG|5|This really helps me keep an eye on my Motorcycle Key! Its Huge!
B003W95SPS|5|Gives the miata a nice little grumble!
B00RLSYBCC|4|Pods look great, angle is a little off needed to pull gauges out to get a complete view when sitting in center of seat, otherwise I would have to lean to the right to see full view of gauge.  Easy to install like the black color it came in, but you can just as easily paint to your interior color.
B008OYAJUK|5|Exactly as described and a perfect fit at 1/3 the cost of Polaris branded components.  The included retention straps are a little tricky to use properly but they can be installed with a set of needle nose pliers and some heavy duty scissors or wire cutters.
B00515NKVA|4|I bought 6 of the spark plugs for my 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0.  I have noticed that since I have replaced the old copper plugs, that the Jeep starts without a hesitation.  There doesn't seem to be a performance boost or gas difference to the coppers.  They are pre-gaped, but I did verify the gap with a wire gap just in case and they were properly gaped.  Before purchasing, look for reviews for people that have purchased them for the same vehicle and motor because I have heard that some people have had issues with them.  The only downfall to the plugs (At least for me.) is the price.  Though, if you compare the lifespan of the iridium plugs to the platinum plugs, it isn't too bad.
B00U9ORO3I|5|Wanted something to replace the stock Charger Emblem. This was perfect and looks good on the back of my car.
B003YMPR7C|5|You know...I'll probably go OEM AC Delco from now on.  These are clearly superior to the 'cheapest thing I can find from a brand I've heard about' that I usually put on.
B00480J4CI|5|GREAT
B00Q7HV6NA|1|This review is revised. I was deceived...so I am updating this review!! I thought that these lights would last longer than a month! Instead, only a few of them are working on the bar. A waist of money! Not worth the effort of installing! You can hang it up after a month!!!!
B0083QH3UI|5|I ordered this for my sister after she told me it was going to cost her $300 to get a new key for her car since her other one broke.  I ordered this hoping it would work and not only did we get it faster than expected, but it works perfectly!  I would definitely buy again!
B013SAJ1FS|4|I purchased this tool set for the guys at work who work on outboard motors both 2 cycle and 4 cycle. They seem to spend a lot of time hunting around for tools and i hoped that maybe this might make things a little easier for them on at least a few jobs. I love that each of the drivers is labeled seperatly making things even easier. They are made of good quality and have a great gripped handle for easy use. They are packaged in their own little plastic pouch which is great for storing them and making sue they are together and easy to find when needed. The Rum River Tool Co. offers a wonderful 100% money back guarantee for those that decide this kit isn't what they are looking for. Overall i thought it was a great little tool kit that is perfect for anyone that is working on 2 cycle carbs!<br /><br />I recieved this product in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.
B00D8D1YYC|5|Very satisfied. Came earlier then advertised. Product is very nice quality for a very good price.
B00KGLLFR0|4|Always a good buy !
B00UL3EUYS|5|Fixed in 5 minutes worked great
B000I2SWXC|5|good product
B00E9HWSV4|5|fits - you will need to trim little
B002NI0NQI|5|Seems to work very well.  Have to give it more time, as I just installed it.
B00JA1BU54|5|good looking headers
B006J96442|5|perfect fit
B00L888TVA|5|excellent product that dors the job of protecting the fuel filling sustem from debris. its easy to use and manufacturer includes and additional gasket. this is a cummins diesel must have item!
B00NFSNAS8|5|Great quality, arrived exactly on time
B00MGRD67E|5|Nice.
B003ZWG6T4|2|wrong item........probably my mistake but the info seems also to have been inadequate for me to make a better choice....
B007DBT42E|1|none of my led lights work  and instructions wait my money
B00SX2845U|5|Beautiful plate!
B005BNYY26|5|Great price!
B00CUAWEUM|5|I used this with ONR and it only marred my 2002 Acura TL's side skirt because the lube was dripping right off. Other than that, I think it works a lot better than the Fine!
B00QFSAPP6|5|You need a good/quality relay kit when you wire fog lights. This is the kit you want!!!
B00BVPYPT0|5|It's been a great product !
B00KTIVHLY|5|I ordered these just for the red shells.  Didn't realize they were actually new transmitters too.  For now, I just put the old transmitter in the new shell.
B00QFY2BCK|2|It didn't work too well on my car.  Headlights are still foggy.
B003Y7ZQCS|3|broke within 50 mile ride. wasnt binding or pinched. just snapped.
B003L35990|5|Used to use K & N oil filters on my 2008 Corvette Z06 (the built in nut on end of filter was handy) but decided to switch to RP after K & N switched manufacturing of my filter to Mexico. The RP filter is made in the USA and seems to be of a higher quality than the &#34;new&#34; K & N.
B000CC0HZ4|5|Works
B0009IR0HE|5|Chevy hitch fit perfect
B00IF9LPJI|5|Good!! Came in a timely manner.<br />Same font as in the picture, it comes like that.<br />I ordered another decal &#34; stay classy&#34; and it's not the same font as in the picture.
B0009JKI7W|5|Fit perfectly and work well
B001IZKDZI|4|Great- just as advertised-FOLLOW UP-April 2016 the cover has now started to tear  like if it was made of rice paper-I am going to try and contact Camco
B007QBX6Y8|5|Good
B005QRO04Y|5|Got it for my 2005 G35 coupe, put some headers and some high flow cats. The exhaust looks great, and after installing everything the sound that comes out of my car its AMAZING.
B0058PZLZG|4|Arrived as expected ...
B00FH2MVV2|3|Bought 2 sets for my SUV. Loved them till they faded
B0077BRP26|5|Worked like a charm and delivered fast!  Would buy again.
B00FQ0ROZS|4|Lights are great, only problem, not delivered when they said they would be.
B009AA2GQC|5|I hit a deer, a glancing blow, which was enough to trigger the air bag light but (fortunately) not the airbag itself.  I had a friend pull the codes, which indicated that this sense was tripped.<br /><br />This part is very easy to replace.  I didn't even need to jack up the truck.  Light is out!
B00KFJWWP2|1|Does not fit an SV650 as stated. The clutch is too narrow (half) the thickness required to fit the perch.
B0001UZUW2|4|Killing the flies in mid-air.  Whack!
B001REZ4JU|5|Best battery protector on the market
B00NAUKQ0Q|5|Fantastic product.  Would buy more if I needed them.
B002OJBNJC|1|Did not work out of the package. Not sure why but it didn't.
B000C1LLMI|5|Perfect fit
B001FAK4B4|5|A+++++
B005C58T38|5|I like
B000EPX5LC|5|Very high quality rotors that noticeably improved stopping distance with no issues of warping.
B00EO878QI|2|I have a Polaris 900 2013 walker evens.<br />A cording to the add it clearly said that the mounting plate is universal to polaris 1000 and 900 this mounting plate  doesn't fit my machine. I had to spend another $57.00 plus shipping.
B0009N0W6U|5|3rd one I've ordered for me ,friends and family...awesome product!
B000NVW1LM|5|It stopped a power steering leaks from a 1993 Chevy.  No drops after a year.
B00NHBYOA6|4|I bought this to take on a long drive and to hold my medication. This unit did am excellent job keeping cold items cold and hot things hot (not at the same time). Currently when not traveling I use it as a cooler for beer, water and other beverages and food. Just be careful with the top as it holds the heating & cooling elements. One drawback is the cord cover, this always is rather hard to close correctly four stars, fix the cord cover and five stars.
B00HZSNBBK|5|Great view to the rear, easy to pull out when towing a trailer.  Adjustable lower mirror provides a excellent view for close viewing.
B000BNZPSI|1|Does not work, will not allow the arm mechanism to open the tailgate in locked or unlocked position. 24 years in atomotive and I cannot get this to work, grind, wd40, oil,hammer. bending linkage..........
B003WDDLTO|5|great stuff
B004L22A1U|5|I got a great deal on these. They have great stopping power and virtually no dust. They are super quiet as well.
B002YXQLAY|5|Does what I bought it to do
B000HE6H6K|5|Depending on your type of radiator this is safe to install. Aluminium radiators have a very strong core and shouldn't be a problem. If you have a brass and copper radiator be careful.
B00O72R7Z8|5|Purchased 5 of these for multiple light bars on different ATV's. The wiring harnesses made the installation of the lights easy as all the connections were preassembled. I used these on 8 inch to 50 inch light bars with no problems. Can't beat the price for these.
B006L985WY|3|Material way stretchy and hard to apply. Wet apply method for sure!
B002UIW58U|5|Met expectations.....Great price..
B00192KY22|5|Great product!
B000AL8VD2|5|My little old school secret. Don't need to spend extra $ on a dedicated products to keep acid away from your car battery posts. This has other multiple uses & does the job great.
B003BZQ6KY|5|Works like a champ.  All my co-workers are getting one now.
B000BQW5LK|5|I used this to change the manual transmission oil in my Jeep.  Like most manual trannies, you have to get the oil into a hole about halfway up the side of the gearbox, and there's no room to work.  This made the job easy.  If I have one gripe, it's the same as another reviewer noted, and it's that it takes about 6,437 pumps to completely empty a quart bottle.  Still, it was way better than having oil running down my arms trying to do it any other way.<br /><br />I used it with RedLine MT90 bottles which don't have the same thread as a regular quart bottle, but you just set the pump on top of the bottle and go to town - works fine just the same.
B005345ESQ|4|Little small and cheap
B003YK96VC|5|One of the best purchases I have made for my 2012 Ram 3500
B0009U7Y2I|4|Does its job great.
B00JLNI3QK|5|I went to my local Lexus dealership to inquire about the price of floor mats only to find out their prices were double what this dealership was charging. This price includes mats for the front AND back which is pretty reasonable considering the alternative. They also included a reusable bag and key chain.
B007N6JQZE|5|Great replacement door handle.  the color is a little off then the stock color in the car but everything lined up properly and was a direct replacement.
B0091YWA22|5|very good and fast service would order again
B00F9RNIPI|5|Very rugged and just what I expected.
B0033BXWQC|5|Great sign.
B00ZBBDIYI|5|Great kit. Has good gaskets not the cheap paper or cork.
B00LNDSKJG|2|Good light but same problem as the old ones bulb burns out too fast in going to try led only from now on
B003K2IP4I|2|after a year of driving the front pads started to squeak and dust like crazy
B00JAA847W|5|This is a cheap and easy way to freshen the look of your bleak dash. You may not even realize it until you have this installed. Makes you want to drive more! Without them, there's no contrast in the dash, so it really makes some eye candy :P. At first, I found the rings a bit thick, just look at hoe close the speedometer needle gets to hitting it, but it's not that bad in the end. It grew on me but that might bother someone. They seem a bit cheap, but that's because they are. Nonetheless, it's got the perfect amount of shine to them. Very OEM look.<br /><br />As for installation. I have no experience with cars whatsoever and it took me an hour, and 30 of those minutes were spent cleaning off dust I kept noticing. So two words of advice.<br />1. Work in a dust free environment, and look very closely for dust and other little things to save a lot of time re-opening the cluster.<br />2. Unplug the battery. There's so many questions online (in my experience) if you should to keep the electronics working properly and to avoid an airbag light. Just do it. Don't take the chance. Be creative if your short on tools, I used a wire cutter to twist it off (and a screw driver)
B00873J0YY|3|Product works as listed and it is true you get what you pay for. Assembly took a lot longer than expected. FULL assembly required. Parts did not easily fit together  and screw holes did not all line up so manipulation was necessary. Easy to mount on roof rack by hand but need to use tools to take it off. Good product for the money if you have the patience for assembly.
B0009IK60M|1|didnt fit, would require some modification and MAYBE work. i just stuffed some JB Weld on the old one and it works just fine. and it passed safety inspection is HI.
B000FPZSN4|5|works great
B008BX7FII|5|Came in on time and easy to install. Look great as well
B0081STA6I|2|It works ok.  Thanks
B0000AZ6TP|5|NGK makes a good spark plug. I run them in everything I own and have no complaints.
B000CITK8S|5|this does exactly what it is supposed to do, i use it on a portable car stereo running off a lawn battery. I can run the radio for several hours and plug the charger in and its topped off within a few hours,sometimes i just leave it plugged in while using the radio at the same time no problem whatsoever.
B0045WBVUM|1|Just not what i expected,not so great,my ass still hurts.my old jell better.
B00BFL7P7E|5|Wow.....  these are the best looking fog lamp bulbs ever.
B000GT655O|1|This air cleaner stud is Way Too Long for the air cleaner on my 79 corvette. Because its Not threaded all the way you Can't cut it shorter for a correct fit since the smooth middle part will Not thread into your Carb or screw onto a wing nut. I had to Buy a universal stud that was threaded all the way and cut it for a correct fit.
B00T2U112A|5|item as described
B003LTEC0G|5|Very nice little lights. Very bright. Easy install & look great. You must install resistors but Amazon will recomend ones when you put them in the cart.
B0018C85VK|4|Arrived on time.  Excellent product, however, was not lon enough.
B00H3TMTIW|5|great deal
B0085IJVBI|4|ventmate unit was great but  there was a slight crackat one of the bfour support pillars
B00XX2F3YA|5|Highly recommend
B001P11SCM|4|After laying down more warp into my brake rotors than Sulu on the Enterprise, I knew it was time to put trailer brakes on my truck. Based on reviews, I rolled the dice on the Tekonsha 90160 Primus (which, by the way, would be a really great name for the next Transformer robot) and screwed it to my Superduty's dashboard.<br /><br />The wiring was made easy by the Ford's existing harness taped underneath the dash, but the Tekonsha came with a  very good wiring diagram regardless. After hooking it up and adjusting it to the trailer, it seems to work very well and goes about its job with magnanimity and good humor. The only drawback I can dwell on is the red LED display; the controller has to be at a very specific angle to see the numbers completely, and at the bottom of the dash, I can't read the top line of the LEDs, even when the device is tilted as far up as it can go. However, I refuse to be a whiny bitch about that too much as the damned thing works just fine.<br /><br />SIDEBAR: A red LED? What is this, 1984?
B009WD6OV0|5|I have the Batwing fairing from Memphis Shades for my VTX1300c (2006), the Bag does work great but a few modifications is needed, . It's exactly what I needed for my bike. The issue with the installation was the mounting of the bag to the Bat Wing. It's really an issue with the Batwing and not the Bag.
B00404UPY8|4|Don't  like this product. It's kinda heavy
B00D2QL0DU|4|Great for using bathwater in these times of drought!
B008WOUNAI|5|This Stabilizer kit is awesome!! Everything bolted right up and was delivered to my door before the estimated shipping date. I installed it on my 2008 6.7 3500 1 ton Dually and the little vibration it had is gone!! Can't beat the price, I highly recommend this kit for anyone that has that death wobble affect.
B00FA64Q7W|5|High quality and perfect fit for my 2012 Ram 1500
B00FT101VS|5|Works great!
B00HJ1592C|1|Not what I anticipated! Wouldn't order again!
B011E9TN6W|3|Purchased this for a 2016 Forester same as the 2015 model year. When installed it sits about 2+ inches above the hood and seems out of place.<br />If you Forester has &#34;Eyesight&#34; you cannot install a bug deflector because it interferes with the eyesight operation.  For those of us that do not have &#34;Eyesight&#34; AVS need to go back to the drawing board and lower the height.
B00J0DV13I|5|It's the second one I've owned, they're very handy.
B000CRVFYQ|5|Great quality part.  Fit perfectly.
B008OWUGZU|1|Right part number but does not fit.
B00G09VDQU|5|Perfect fit. Hardest part was removing old on. Don't forget to coat with UV protection.
B00KHUQAY8|5|I love this Studded steering wheel cover, only thing is that it smells like straight out of the factory and it takes a little time for the smell to go away. But once it does, its great :) Thanks
B003ZZNTK0|5|Love my tag. Nicely made. Good quality.
B00A1X9IU4|5|Less expensive than the dealer. Will order again.
B00M8QJLNG|5|Great light for the money. Visible from 180 degrees.  Will buy again.
B0049ON690|5|Genuine OEM Reverse Input Clutch Housing.  I checked it for run-out and it was near perfect.  My Suburban thanks you!!
B004VIA0JI|2|ordered a extra large and it fits except for the arms are to skinny to fit my hands and arms in and its not like I work out or have fat arms. might cut arms off or try returning and try a larger size
B00PQWN5DQ|4|the company even emails you the guide how to use it! I give 4 stars only because the background is black and it's a little bit difficult to read white/red numbers there.
B004XONSX0|4|Definitely didn't see a coolant temp drop of any kind. But I bought it because it holds more fluid. It was missing the gasket and drain plug. Called Derale and they happily sent me those. Good customer service. Pan looks to be good quality. Only 4 stars because they advertise it as a cooling pan when I didn't see a temp drop. I have a constant 180-190 degree temp with ford pan and with this pan.
B004TO0WJW|5|Quality at a good $$$$
B00K5A9FU6|5|Great replacement coolant tank for my 2007 Mazda 3 with a 2.3L in it.  Amazon says it doesn't fit my application,  but Dorman's website says it does and they are right on the money.  It's identical to the original and even has steel renforcements in the coolant connections.  It is a very quality product and the price is right on the money.  I highly suggest this if your tank springs a random leak like mine did.
B00CHRSA6U|5|product was as advertised. easy installation, direct fit and worked great.
B0002SRL20|5|Well made.  Does what it is supposed to.
B000H6QWWC|5|very good product
B007N6YRYO|5|Work great, look like they are made well. I saved a lot with these compared to the local auto store. Fit was spot on, great replacements and now my hood will stay up without my prop stick.
B00CU6B4IY|2|I bough 5 of these as gifts. Not what I expected. Only fair quality. I returned them.
B00SLKQHXK|4|Instructions are not very good.  As someone else wrote... the left and right center brackets are marked for the wrong side.  Once I switched them, the install went fine.  They look nice and are solidly mounted to the truck.
B00VOLTCD0|5|Nice size, identical to photo shown on Amazon.<br />Just gotta figure out where to put it!
B00IXXRK8G|5|Worked perfect.
B0060M4DNW|5|Very good
B00020CATC|3|Very expensive for what it is, and not a whole lot of it either.  I used it to dampen the cups on my Denon D-5000's.  Works great and is what I needed.  I just wish it were not so expensive for what is really some rubber mat with adhesive.
B00393ND6S|4|Good
B00JLVHY4Y|5|Perfect fit and look great.
B00OPBEF0Q|5|exelent
B00008RW9V|5|Got them and my son and husband like them very much. They really work good.
B002L7C3IC|5|I have bought 3 that was chrome and they would bubble and peel. Hope this one doesn't.
B0033DQ91U|5|exactly what i expect
B005R21SH0|5|Makes it so easy to transport my propane tanks and keeps them fro tipping over. Got one for each of my two 30 lbs tanks.
B00NNZTCR6|2|one of the lights didnt work
B0009IQZH0|5|the best rag in the world
B001CMX2QO|1|Not satisfied with item. Right out of the box paint was peeling around the straight edge side. In my opinion textured paint should not go all the way to the edge. Had to scrape all loose paint 1/4&#34; up from the edge. Protective cover for straight edge to store while not in use is a piece of 1/4&#34; I.d clear rubber hose sliced down the side.  Overall poor quality in my opinion and definetly no what I expected
B0038KVOZE|5|Thanks
B002WIU5YO|5|every thing i needed for my garmin nuvi 500 works perfect thanks
B0006JLW84|5|Fit right on the RV.
B000NSHRUK|4|Great product! Thanks
B0002STSQM|4|I would give it five stars if it stopped tire tread wear :)
B003S859VQ|5|Worked like a charm and saved over $250.00 from what the dealer wanted for an additional key.  Key was $7.50 and dealer charged $49.25 to program it.  Lowes wouldn't cut the key for me...but Home Depot did with no problem.  It works perfectly.  Next thing I need to do is get another, as it says if you have two working keys you and program additional keys from them.  Yay!
B0084UIS3O|5|WeatherTech  perfection.
B00J6DQNVC|5|Lots of money! The plugs are new ac delco, arrived on time, we're not in original packaging but were packaged very well, individually bubble wrapped in a heavy cardboard box. I installed the plugs and they did what they are supposed to do. I'm completely satisfied!
B008P7A6DG|2|Does not remove swirl marks/spider webbing, merely covers them up. Only lasts for a few car washes and then looks a lot worse. It actually put more swirl marks in my clear coat after using, noticed way more than were there before applying. Save your money and buy a polishing equipment.
B000S2VX88|5|works better than the original
B003ZWHLCU|5|Great price n shipping fast.
B005CRE2K0|5|Looks great will give it 5 stars.  Will be back later with another update if they don't hold up.  So if you don't see an update from me then they are good to purchase.
B00EPDLTN0|5|looks great!
B001UFXTG6|4|Tremendous Change in how truck handles with 30 ft trailer attached.
B00IXW0H3W|5|LOL
B0045MYETM|5|It has protected the hauler from damaging weather. The material feels sturdy. It should last a while.
B00F5MU9MW|5|Great
B00K7XNEE4|5|Works great and looks that way as well.
B00RVUGJES|4|Great product. Really makes my Challenger stand out!
B0015D19SS|4|Cheap, but gets the job done. Put a canoe on it, and had no suspicions it was unstable for 500 miles of driving. Telescoping pole made the fit perfect. Hate strapping over weather stripping though.
B000MLANY0|5|It was a gift for someone and she loved the floormats
B0026MCTL8|5|Arrived on time and was a perfect fit! Overall Ford did not do a good job on the design of this, but this item is a great fit for a great price!
B000F2ZYHC|5|Well worth the money... Couldn't get this good of deal at my local auto store!
B00BITHTAG|5|received on time & it only took a few minutes to install
B004WO9LRI|5|They worked out very well for a  07 Toyota Tacoma.
B000CIMCPQ|5|Easy install, and very nice sound! Would recommend over any other exhaust
B000AXE7DI|1|Leaked all over. It had obviously been repackaged by UPS due to leaking and then leaked more in the UPS plastic bag. About half the bottle gone. Labels also slipped off of bottle and unable to be read. Need refund.
B00RZ1TKYE|5|Very compact and strong jumper with air compressor. Used this to replace a bulky old jumper box which was size of car battery. This new technology is much more compact and jumps our V8 Ford's without a problem. Have jumped cars three times prior to recharging the unit.
B008Y8QLYY|1|Not at all what I wanted. The picture showed a transfer case not a module. I have sent it back. I expect my credit card be credited at once
B00DJ4FMK2|5|Good stuff
B005JHKGKI|5|Perfect size for top of windshield.
B008CH9JAA|4|If you try to adjust many times, it will become loose.  Not too bad.<br />But I bought another set in chrome to see it could be better!
B00VZMY1I4|5|Great
B0017OCROA|4|The quality was fine and shape was fine. I ordered the wrong one by mistake.<br />Not the sellers fault. I should have shopped better.
B003SS62PS|4|I bought this fan to use when I play golf, it does serve the purpose.  It doesn't move a great amount of air but any amount is welcome when the heat is in the 90° or hotter range.  I did not notice it being very loud but I use it outside so that probably has a lot to do with that.  Hook up is simple, I also brought a couple of &#34;chip clips&#34; from home to hold the wiring up on the top of the cart and out of the way.  I also bought the add on female adapter with terminal clips and it worked like a charm.  I don't think this is worth the trouble to hook up when the temps are under 90° as it just doesn't move enough air to make it worthwhile at those temperatures.
B00KQGZQB6|5|Bought 5 and have used 3 of them. Works great. Need patience to adjust accurately.
B000C5YCZ2|5|Excellent!!!
B00TYMNARU|5|perfect fit.  The rubber pegs keep the mats in place
B00J4PEO4U|5|Well no one else is going to review it and these brakes definitely deserve one. To start, they have a beautiful finish on them, so they look good even without slots or drills in them. I have these on the rear of my E46 3-series and they're great. My fronts are still OEM, but are a bit worn. The point I'm about to make is that these brakes give huge performance gains while retaining pedal feel. If you want to know how I figured this out or what I mean, continue reading.<br />What this means is that the braking pressure is uneven. Usually the fronts take 70-80% of the braking when the rotors are the same thickness, but since my rears are new and my fronts in need of replacing, the rear brakes are taking on more braking pressure. This also means when having to make an aggressive stop, my rear brakes are working WAY harder than my front brakes. At the end of any short drive where I feel the brakes, even though the rears are doing more braking than the fronts, their usually only half the temperature. This means they're more efficient and can allow for more hard braking, or won't overheat as quick as standard brakes.
B00Y5MZYE6|5|Does this work for the 2015 Corolla?
B009CNYJG2|5|Needed to measure DC amps, and this meter proved to be an economical solution. Had to read the instructions, though, to learn how to zero-out each reading. Accuracy matches more expensive product.
B006QMIJKY|5|Product was exactly as advertised and delivery was prompt.
B000CNAO9W|3|I should have measured my Old filter before ordering this one. The 3 inch filter is too high on my 79 corvette. I need a 2 inch filter for the hood to close. The air cleaner does Not come with the extra parts pictured and do come with a wing nut but No stud. The air cleaner is nice except for a filter that is too high and i prefer Not to have the brand name stamped on the top lid.
B00ZS9S1LS|1|Received it torn in 2 piecess and is EXTREMELY SMALL !!!  Not worth $5.00.  No one will see this on the bumper of a car !
B000E2AL2G|5|Quick and simple performance
B00HKY8ZWE|5|Great buy and great lights, brighter than the ones I had before. Better quality and easier to put on, again look at the box that it comes on, they are that good.
B00RCQAPNW|5|all perfect
B000KL57XE|5|5 minute wiring!  Plugs right in to the factory plug.  Saves a ton of work.
B00GFDLRNU|4|Nice heavy metal quality. Good shipping.
B00BQE5JAK|4|These leds serve their purpose and do it well. I installed 4 of these as interior lighting since my dome lights weren't enough. The leds themselves put out a decent amount of light but, I wouldn't install them on the outside of a car any time soon. The adhesive strips on the back are not trustworthy at all and I supplemented them with a few small dabs of glue to get them to stop falling off. Since I applied the glue they have all stuck for over 2 weeks with no issues. Without the glue they all fell from their locations within a night, hence the 4 star review.<br /><br />A lot of people have been asking for the power draw of the strips and noone seemed to have to accurate of an answer. Since I was installing into a setup with other devices I was worried my amp draw would be too great so I hard wired a small amp meter. These pull a grand total of .37amps (4 light strips) or about .09 amps a piece. Basically you could leave these running over night and I doubt it'd put a dent in your car battery.<br />The wire that is attached the led bar is very thin, low strand, and a pain in the butt to strip so be mindful of that when wiring up.
B00C7PX19I|5|Easy installation and functions just as advertised.Great product!
B00HYFYJXS|2|they worked it just could not get loud enough to hear above 50 mph
B001DRLPJE|5|Perfect Fit for 2012 VW Golf TDI. Old filter was very smelly and dirty. Smells much better after replacing the filter in the cabin.
B005R4LBCA|2|It didn't fit correctly in my 2010 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS.  Not sure if mine was &#34;defective&#34; or not, but it would absolutely not reach from one side of the windshield to the other.  I would attempt to get it to &#34;stretch&#34; to reach, but then it would retract (almost accordion--like) and be about 1-2&#34; short. on the opposite side.  Returned and just stuck with the collapsible cheaper shades since it worked just as well.
B004VNDHIE|5|I love it !!!
B002UC8LXE|5|Excellent replacement shroud. The base requires you to rivet the bottom portion to the top portion, with rivets included. You will need a riveting tool.
B002OR2LRM|3|Delivery  in time and was in good shape. Sadly it doesn't  fit tightly like a glove like the factory light. Wish it was a perfect fit.
B006MX8196|4|I never usually write reviews, but I feel this is needed to address the many other bad reviews. These are NOT custom seat covers, so you can't expect perfection. If you want something perfect, custom seat covers start at $150 and up. With that being said I am extremely pleased with these covers. At first I was skeptical about buying them because of the bad reviews I read. One review even said they do not fit a Ford Escape at all, which is not true. These seat covers fit almost perfect in my car. They do require A LOT of work to be installed, which is why I was going to take off a star. I decided against doing so. As for the reviews saying they look horrible, you need to make sure you get the seat covers on tight and pull the straps the best you can without ripping the. If you can't get them on your seats, you're either stupid or stupid. There is a strange smell to them like other reviews have said, but the smell is bearable. I believe the people who gave bad reviews didn't take their time to install, or just lack commen sense. There were also comments about the headrest looking horrible, which I didn't think looked too bad. I would definitely recommend theses to anyone looking for better quality seat covers than the cheap Walmart crap. Would definitely buy again.<br /><br />For reference, I drive a 2008 Ford Escape xlt.
B00OW0UAJA|5|Exactly as described! Great quality.
B007R6JRXQ|4|Looks great..finish dulled after a few months
B001O07V2A|5|These are the cheapest nomex socks I could find, and amazon ships them quickly, great if you've been busy getting your car ready and forgot to get fireproof socks the day before a race. There are likely better nomex socks out there, but this isn't a fashion show, it's a race and these work just fine. Though I haven't had the chance to test their fire resistance just yet, and hopefully I won't get that chance any time soon.
B0052FRROK|1|The Product Description said it fit both American and Japanese Camry's.  It doesn't fit my American made Camry, so I had to pay to return it and now I'll have to pay to replace it once I find the correct one.
B00JA3BMDW|5|This is a great little temp gun. I cannot vouch for 100% accuracy, but it seems to work well enough. We are using it to determine the temperatures in a terrarium, so +- a few degrees doesn't really matter.
B00BXQXR3C|2|The container was defective. I sent them pictures and an email but have had no reply. Also it is picture with a sprayer which was not included
B004SLCEMY|5|A+
B003DNJ728|1|&#34;Elasticized bottom hem for a fast, custom fit&#34;  &#60;----&#60;&#60;&#60;  This is what got me to make this purchase. Unfortunately the elastic is ONLY at the ends.. the sides have none.. so on a non-windy day it still blows off immediately.. nothing to hold it on.. they give you one oddly short ribbon (3 to 4 ft long) that is supposed to do... do what? .. Waste of money, will probably throw it in the garbage.. not worth the effort to sew my own elastic around the edges that would prevent it from flying off..  it mostly fits like a blanket you throw over your car, just useless.<br /><br />Cloth is nice and sturdy enough, nice color.. but just doesn't fit my car at all..
B00E3XUMVC|5|Works as described.
B0016KABGQ|4|I will give it a 4 star for now have not used the device.
B009PNEIHY|2|My seats don't open in the back so I can't tighten the bottom cover.  Using it anyway but it stinks
B00B0N8OFY|5|perfect oem, only needed the case, but now I will order acase and have it programmed.
B002SSMGCW|4|Be warned ! Water heater itself is great, but nobody told me i was suppose to buy the door flange too. That isbthe piece that screws onto it and then that piece also screws into the outside camper itself and the door hinges on it. I had to saw the old one off and reuse it.
B00C6N0MIY|5|Perfect fit on our 1999 Forester. Firmed up the ride and steering and quite a bit less expensive than the OEM parts. Great buy.
B00RBW43MG|5|Great match - almost unnoticeable!
B00NIMFTOE|1|Bought two of these. Neither worked.<br /><br />Typical China junk.
B00BI2HF5M|5|Product received as described.
B005C5EEF0|5|All good
B0093LYB20|4|Mirrors are working well. No problems with the attachment tape
B00D9C2CDO|3|Hard to complain because of the price and, overall, we really like this waterproof car-top carrier. Only problem we've had is some slight exterior tearing wear the straps are sewn to it. The stitching is good but the exterior didn't hold up to the tension. We have used it on two long trips and gotten our money's worth but I'm considering paying a little more for a hard top for the long term.
B002ZKEV4O|5|Fast delivery everything works great
B0039O1UWQ|2|I'm giving this rack only 2 stars. Terrible brackets that don't fit securely.
B00029WYBM|5|really nice when you clean 7-8 filters after each race
B00H45ASE2|4|Amazon really does have everything. I couldn't find this axle locally but Amazon had it. It's not the same as the OEM part for the GTI, which has a bigger diameter tube, but my wife is now the daily driver and my track days are finished, so this one will work fine. All that plus free shipping and no core charge. Who can beat that?
B000C1F8TU|5|I purchased this to replace the fuel pump in my 1999 Ford F250 work truck. It went in easily and now the truck runs again!<br /><br />Installing the pump was the easy part - dropping the tank was a huge pain!
B002PUM6MS|5|Easy to install.
B00EFYJ5TO|1|Do not purchase. I paid over $23 and only received ONE screw. No where in description stated &#34;one screw&#34; and the picture is for 12 screws.
B000H8U37A|5|exact aftermarket replacement for my 2000 jeep grand cherokee.  does include lamp sockets and mine came with the bulbs.  used it to replace a cracked one and fit just like the original at a fraction of the extremely ridiculous price the dealer charged.  now i can drive my jeep to a cliff and drive it off without getting stopped for a cracked tail light on the way there.  can't wait to get rid of this car.  nothing but problems since day one.  but these replacement lights do look nice :-)
B004N6LN9E|3|Passenger side seal was not sealed allowing a significant amount of water to build up inside of the light.
B00IKL1Y3S|5|Great price
B0048IZXKM|5|Awesome part so far.Easy to install took about a hour.Recommended it if your window want roll back up.Great product
B00SLFH4QO|5|The grill turned out great. I also added the Nismo Emblem. I love it, all my friends love it!
B00XZ9PQFW|1|I guess you really do get what you pay for. The build quality on this thing is atrocious. Was able to transplant my cut key into this shell finally and you can really tell the difference between the OEM and this. The shells aren't comparable. The sizes of some of the internal parts like the key spring are different. Thankfully the circuit board from the original did fit into this and I was able to make it work with the exception of the key not staying properly stored in the folded position.<br /><br />Would not buy again.
B004I16S8U|5|Arrived on time and was easy to on my 2004 Dodge Ram 1500.
B00LX2296M|5|perfect.
B002K5WXXU|5|Looks great will give it 5 stars.  Will be back later with another update if they don't hold up.  So if you don't see an update from me then they are good to purchase.
B007FR3JVI|5|So far so good !<br />All I can do is hope  it holds up .
B0014FILLU|4|Hitch is good for it's price.. The directions have a lot to be desired. They should be inproved.
B00DC4PDLC|1|Cheap garbage. DO Not Buy This Product.
B008JPQGDS|4|Doing good
B0033PFZ4U|3|Not what I expected.
B009PIKC4C|5|Excellent quality just what I was needing
B0054RW1HE|5|Only drawback is mild whistle noise at very high speeds, but otherwise excellent low-profile product that keeps my vehicle &#34;street legal&#34; even when the doors are removed.  I leave the clamps screwed into my jeep 24/7 and when the doors & factory mirrors come off, these mirrors go on without any tools required.
B008564ZQG|4|Seems to be a good fit on to the radiator and with the upper radiator hose, which is not always the case. It doesn't show it here, but it also came with a bleed screw already in place. NOTE: This is for a car with Manual Transmission. If you have an automatic, you will also want to get the Thremostat that sits in the bottom of this thing. They always come out in pieces.
B000ET525K|5|Still driving on the patch. And how easy it was.
B005HFYE1O|5|As the reviewer &#34;obmohn&#34; said the color choices on their wiring are a little off, with red being negative and black being positive but with a little fiddling you can get them apart and swap the colors.  I did that for my application because it made more sense but they'll work just the same with the backwards colors.  Perhaps there is some weird automotive standard that specifies things backwards or something and they're following that?
B000FW2N08|5|I have a old 1957 Hyster forklift that was leaking badly out the top of the lift cylinder.  This would be a real pain to take it off without having the ability to move it around and reinstall it.  I did a search and found this.  Past experience with Lucas products has been good so decided to try it.  The leak went from a huge puddle after parking it overnight to just a small drip.  It has been in for about a week so may still be in the progress of eliminating it.  If it doesn't stop it completely I may try another gallon.  Very happy with the results and recommend it.
B008O1N1JE|4|But surely a good replacemt cable
B00JF5LRN0|3|Heavy doesn't seem secure sticks out very far noisy when folded up
B00K53EWCO|5|Quick shipping works great
B00CZD7QOS|5|This is the first product I have ever used for my car that did what it was advertised too do.<br />I bought the small bottles to test. I am very please with the product.
B00UITEEZA|1|The bulbs are very good quality but not the ballast
B00OCAICC2|5|Fits perfectly. Thanks
B001CF4UXU|5|Always with us in our van.  It is strong, sturdy and well made.  Should work for most recoveries.  It helped us in the sand. Glad to have this product.
B005FL6SPU|1|The rotors in this kit are the $99 ones not the $169. I had send them back to get them same ones delivered again. DON'T BUY THESE
B008DWKF98|5|Just the right thing I wanted.
B002OPCOYE|5|direct fit easy installation , had no problems works great
B0031XHGMI|1|did not work would not let me return it Amazon said go to Manufacturer and they said go to Amazon
B00I0SE1CC|4|Very load wind noise to me
B0038DAZM4|5|Worked perfectly.
B00KTIYXLU|1|does not work for ford taurus 2005
B007Y85B3W|5|Great product, fit perfect on my Honda Accord 2007 VP
B004RLJKPY|1|I'm sorry but if you have to but a vest that comes prepatched like this then you should question how much of a &#34;biker&#34; you are you put patches on your bike because you traveled to events and to different cities they are supposed to mean something or have a story.  Not hey look I clicked on amazon.  Buying a few patches on here is fine but not a whole vest for.  Makes nothing better than a rub.
B000C5C2Y0|5|It fit great
B0085IL0QC|5|Good quality product
B00FWOKKGI|5|Perfect
B003CKOXQM|5|Finding larger rear sprockets for the XR250L has been very difficult. This is certainly the best sprocket I've found for the money. I needed to extend the chain to 108 links but the bike is much more capable in the dirt now.
B005VTT4XO|3|Item was what I expected
B00KX10Y5M|5|Perfect
B0054YCW62|5|Fit great over our 12 foot aluminium boat for our vacation trip the 1000 Islands. It stretched right out and was strong.
B000CNKUGO|3|Try your wife or kids HOLE PUNCH (handheld type) for bolt and screw holes, lil tip I thought I might share...so your<br />nice new hand made in America gasket don't bunch up and leak when installed on flat surfaces.<br />Stuff works good, like it should. What I like about it, when I need a gasket, its right there on hand and ready to use.<br />Get yourself an Exacto knife too. Keep extra packs of this in stock....hurry! Buy now!
B00CIG4F96|5|Received promptly! Excellent quality and easy installation. They function as advertised!
B0002SR88C|5|Sturdy, excellently designed. Brilliant all round.<br /><br />I've used this a bunch of times and am still on the first blade (it comes with 5) which, unlike its owner, shows no sign of dulling.
B00GHT8TSI|5|Easy to install, works great.
B00IZRC5Y4|5|Great product. Purchased considerably less then any other &#34;true iridium&#34; spark plugs I've bought. Most &#34;iridium&#34; spark plugs only have a iridium electrode but normal tips which because of that last as long as typical copper plugs.<br /><br />Theses however I've an iridium electrode and a platinum tip that keeps the spark plug from wearing out early.<br /><br />Replaced my old plugs which where AC Delco iridiums and theses where the same exact plugs except for thoses said AC Delco theses said NGK. Save the money and buy theses unless you enjoy paying $2 more per plug for AC Delco packaging.
B004XNQLB2|5|This product is working great for me.  I did clean up the awning real good as well as my hands prior to applying. I would purchase this again
B00F6GKKQC|4|Great set of screwdrivers,  Good stand, Only thing is that you cannot see the screwdriver tips to find the correct screwdriver. Tried to rearrange the screwdrivers to see if that was better. Still cant see the screwdriver tips, What is ended up doing is writing on the head of the screwdrivers the sizes of each screwdriver.
B001DRHMMS|5|Just like OEM for my 07 BMW E90 335xi.
B007552NHQ|5|Works great
B00TR1RCDQ|5|fits like a glove.  a little on the thin side  i would suggest putting some dynmat on them before you install.
B008XNWHHU|5|These work great. Keep my car smelling fresh. Only need to open them up a little bit; they are pretty strong.
B00R6LZOSE|4|Arrived on time and I am happy with the quality of this product.  It looks like it is going to protect the bed of my new truck as well or better than a drop in liner.  I think that they should supply a little more of the Velcro tape for attachment, especially it needs an additional strip across the center of the tailgate.  I found industrial Velcro at Lowes and added it.  Much more secure tailgate cover.
B003TVJFE4|5|Nice product. Delivered fast. Great value. A+++++
B00WQUWV9K|3|Scanner works great.  Found my troubles in 2 minutes.  The software, however, doesn't work and upgrades cannot be downloaded.  I would recommend this to anyone with a BMW
B00JYIT6WC|3|Cheap but functional
B00AI9C5A6|5|Fast shipping. Great product.
B004HP2J0S|3|I would have give it five star except I don't THINK  it will survive a winter.  Followed directions, not much 2 way tape on this item to hold it to the car.  Crossing the fingers.  Over prices for what you get,  but that normal for anything that goes on a jeep
B00JRHI1LM|5|Got this to replace RV camper original mattress which was very hard.  This mattress is  So comfortable....
B00K61CG5U|4|So far, so good.  I wasn't sure at first how these would work (i.e. would they burn out/overheat?), but so far they're bright and look great on my 2014 Accord.  I didn't want to spend an extra $1k for Honda's LED's, but for &#60;$100, these are a great alternative.  Give them a try and see for yourselves!
B004OK77L2|5|Well made m very strong, easy to install .
B004940ZSK|5|Great product. Worked and fit perfectly.
B001G7ECJQ|3|Did not fit my 2002  f-250 power stroke had to hard wire
B001UN78H4|4|Satisfied with glasses.
B0002KNVPE|5|Excellent.
B00CIMSGSG|5|Very easy to install. Fits perfect on Chevy Trailblazer LT 2006 model
B00CKQR2XA|4|OK, for the price
B0002F66G0|5|fit just fine on my 205/75/14 spare
B00OZYHOE2|4|I have a smaller head/face that makes all hats and glasses fit poorly. It is a bit to wide for my face so the outside edges do not sit flat against my face, and there is very little flex to the product so they will probably never fit comfortably. BUT they still will get the job done, considering it is next to impossible to find cheap googles that fit correctly for me.
B00GR8Q8W8|3|Nice key chain but make sure you keep the screw tight or maybe use some locktite. I lost mine because it came unscrewed.
B00168BJ82|4|The mirror was simple to install, but I did have to tighten my mirror ball head to account for the extra weight. For my 2000 honda civic coupe, the view angle is wide, but confusing to me sometimes. I can see so much through the back that it overlaps with my side mirrors, and I see the car in the left lane behind me twice. My head also blocks my left side blind spot so I might look into the concave mirror instead. The width is great, however.
B0083YDM00|2|I have a 2008 corolla le and it doesn't fit had to modify it a little bit so it can fit but I does look great though
B006WMTENO|5|Perfect he love it and the small was nice.
B007IVRCRI|5|Worked out perfectly!
B00KS1TMCI|5|Fits great
B007TYLOAK|5|GREAT PRICES!😃😃
B00IMI9TP4|5|Perfect for my car I love it!
B00CHU60XM|3|Have not used and no directions.
B00KOYRF8C|4|No complaints, it operates a little slow, but that is probably a good thing, I would never leave it unattended. If you are transferring fuel into smaller containers like a 5 gallon tank, then the slowness of the transfer makes you divert your attention to other tasks, which can cause you to not notice when the &#34;transfer to&#34; tank starts to overflow. Other than that, this little device works great.
B005X9E6IK|4|I'm a Linehaul truck driver and found that thermal electric coolers very unreliable.  I stumbled upon this item at a truck stop for almost $200 more.  This refrigerator works as advertised.  Cools warm sodas, water, etc to set temperature in about an hour.  Keeps contets perfectly cold.  I recommend this product to anyone requiring real refrigeration in a portable package.  31 August 2016  Suddenly stopped working.  It was acting &#34;twitchy&#34; if the cord was messed with or disturbed.  I think it's the cord but it will take three weeks for the replacement cord to get here.  Even if it the unit itself I'll probably buy again but maybe the bigger one.  The Cf-35.  Update It was the power cord.  Replaced it and still works well.  Saves me $$$. 3/18/17
B00BTLEIIY|5|the seats fit perfect
B000IYNW1C|5|Worked great.
B001MYU9PE|4|Promtley shipped.  work very well.  except one can not control it in the desulfating mode.
B003HU0YFQ|1|This was not what they sent me. It has bolts all around the front side and back side. Making it so I had to put 1&#34; spacers between it and the bracket. The reason for the spacers is the bolts hit the rounded bracket that chevy has that holds the compressor in place. So this is putting a lot of extra tension on the fan belt. Also the 4 bolts that hold it down are only in the bracket 1/2&#34; now. Would I by from this seller again &#34;NO&#34;. Would I buy this product again &#34;No&#34;. Picture and product do not match!
B00D6YI7CA|5|easy to install and they look wonderful
B00WWHVFGM|4|Good product for the price!
B00HS5SIT0|5|seems to be working well...
B001IGGLGC|2|This bungee does not have much stretch - perhaps 6 or 8 inches on 24&#34; length.<br /><br />The real problem is the really poor quality carabiners. This is problematic as they tout them as a selling point!<br />The swing arms have sticky hinges which no amount of spray oil can ease.<br />However the carabiner loops through a plastic anchor and can be easily removed and replaced with another.<br /><br />And there is a fix. Open the reluctant carabiner a little and wiggle it from side to side every so gently. This forces the hinge area to open and produce a functional snap-closed action.
B00FBKJ2BW|5|It was a snap to install and beats the $110.00 bucks I would have had to pay
B008XNZZ7O|3|Worked well
B00NXFOKL4|4|Excelente
B00C87SZWI|5|Got these some time back and was waiting on new tires to try them.  Just recently got a like new HD Wide Glide and put new tires on it, put the<br />beads in the tubes and have zero complaint.  No vibration or tire wear as of yet and best of all, NO weights disfiguring my chrome spoke wheels!<br />I definitely recommend them.
B002MGYWI6|5|I use Pro Long products in any combustion engine I have!  Boat, Car, Truck and even an air compressor!  My 1999 Silverado Pick up has 430,000 miles on it and I have used Prolong engine and transmission products since it came out of warranty .
B00DRZXRO6|5|Really helps keep the heat out so I am sure it will help keep out the cold air out come winter. Hoping it will help our electric bill.
B007V2C0FS|5|Perfect fit love it.
B004ETK0AI|5|True to picture, works great for my daughter who is in a booster seat in the back seat.
B003R3ZTNU|1|Don't  buy it
B004D0FAIA|5|Been trying to find these connectors since I left Md. Finally did and they really did the job well.
B0009V1WS4|5|very nice!
B00B3YM0DM|5|Great !!  Very fast shipping
B003V0JOEE|5|perfect,just what i wanted !!!!!
B00XIY8NNQ|5|Very happy with this item!  Takes the cavernous size of the 2015 F150 console and transforms it into a organized space.  It has plenty of room to still load up items and still allow the stock tray to slide from side to side.
B007VRF0L4|5|Used it for a hydro brake system on a go-kart worked perfectly couldn't be happier
B003ZW1ZUO|5|Awsome! Easy installation too!
B00BFE5EVU|5|Cleared up the slipping issue with my 2000 Maxima
B00NLYSGOY|5|Excellent product. Looks very nice on my car.
B00CS87YQ0|3|I purchased two.<br />The first one was tweaked when built.<br />I almost returned it but decided to rework it myself, not perfect but usable.<br />The second one was as advertised, very nicely done.
B00JQWEBJE|5|I have it on the back of my bike.  It's nice and bright so when I brake, the people behind me texting or whatever they are doing in their cars will pay attention.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works just like advertised
B000FPZRIU|3|did not fit very well
B00P84T81U|5|Great frame, works well and is solid metal.
B00DRIKQ5G|5|Very Nice
B010IM94JW|1|Removing the door panel and uninstalling the door lock assembly to get to the actuator only to find that the part they listed as rear driver side is actually the rear passenger side actuator. Double checked this with O'Reilly.com and sure enough, the part I purchased was for the passenger side.<br />What a waste of time as I had to reassemble everything. PT Auto Warehouse should get this corrected.
B00068YB88|5|These fit the subie perfect and were exactly as expected.
B003UF5OPI|5|fit great
B0016LEAVM|5|protects my boots well
B006N93158|5|Fits perfectly
B00JTUBP6U|5|A must for contemporary Direct Injection engines to reduce intake valve deposits. The price from Amazon was one-half of the local auto parts stores.
B00429NKWK|5|Amazing, so far!  It's been about two months since I've used this and my headlights are still nice and clear; much better than similar products.  I just wish they sold this brand in auto-parts stores, in my area.
B00XZ9O30Q|5|Better than buying one at the dealerhip!!
B00Y4K2GCC|5|Awesome
B00OM3EXQI|5|Saddlebags look awesome on the Road King. It compliments the bike.
B002UJVNFA|4|Good product and low price.
B0037NVKS8|4|Works great
B00NYBY922|5|It is perfect :)
B00AE27HQE|5|Perfect!
B00DLMHJQW|1|I just got these H.I.D's yesterday for my headlights & fog lights (9005 & H11). Both items came defective and damaged! One of the ballast had a small scrape on the side.. once installed they turned on for about 5 minutes then turned off (9005) and died completely. The H11's worked but they flickered horribly to the point where it looked like a rave was happening from the front of my car! I would no recommend XENTEC. Ended up buying a more expensive kit no problems! If you can go to a local automotive lighting shop I would do that.
B004XONTFW|3|Good but doesn't come with brass fittings, they're aluminium and doesn't have the bung to drill and tap for sensor as shown in picture. It is made in America though.
B00KC399SY|1|One of the batteries would not hold a charge I threw away the hedge trimmer and bought a different brand. Sorry this did not work for me
B008SGDTOM|2|I have wanted these for a LONG time...<br /><br />Finally I see why I feel as though I'm not getting enough of the &#34;Dimple&#34; as I expected... Hope I can get close up enough with an image... I've seen these used  and you can almost follow a design you make with annealed thinner gauges of metal.  Yes it is to be used a instead of your &#34;punch&#34;...<br /><br />I have also wanted to order from Micro Tools for a LONG TIME...  Such a cool resource for all the little things an Artist or any person that loves to work with their hands may need.<br /><br />These are inked Pakistan... Euro Tool?<br />I knew I may get something like this,  but if it made a slightly deeper impression, I would be happier
B00QK70GPG|4|Seem to be well made wipers.
B00173U7D4|4|the product is great ... once spritzed the scent lasts for about 90 minutes.
B007P72J64|5|Works great everything fits perfectly
B00D313GR2|4|Very good quality REFLECTIVE sticker. Difficult to place though if your not experienced with placing stickers. However, this is a good thing as it will be less likely to peel later.
B00WCB96XC|2|Quality of the stickers is not good
B009J6AAGU|5|Great product
B00I93E3JY|5|GOOD VALUE FOR PRODUCT.
B00V7AVT3E|3|The iBoards look good on my Dodge Ram.  I am disappointed in the lack of helpful instructions.  I pretty much had to figure out how to mount them myself.  They also add a body creak when driving.  I have not been able to get the noise to disappear.
B002803TCG|1|PRO:  They are black<br /><br />CON: Did not fit, as in they are too small for my Toyota Tundra TRD Pro, even though Amazon.com says it fits.<br /><br />Other: Can not even sell these on e-bay no one wants them.
B000ML99D6|5|I purchased the floor mats as an early Christmas present for one of my best friends who just purchased a new car.  She loved them.
B000C33MI2|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B000A2N7K8|2|After a year or so of service in high humidity Florida the sensor spring started under reporting high temps. It works OK up to 78 then falls short, reports 92 as 84 Update 6 months after buying a replacement in hopes that it would be more accurate - the new one read 2 degrees low at first but now it reads 5 degrees low. I even installed a little plastic brow to be sure no rain got on it but didn't help. Florida humidity seems to damage this product's bimetallic spring.
B00MFRT6Z6|4|Just like description.
B000KE4JLC|5|I like these. They work well and match my interior. STURDY
B00KMBEMZG|5|If your remote keyless entry fob isn't working, there are two possible problems. If none of the keys are working, it's probably a low battery. But if, like me, you are struggling *only* with locking or unlocking the car, chances are good that the fault lies with this part: the silicone pad with multiple buttons on the back. Specifically, the conductive film on the back. When you press a button, the conductive film acts as a bridge and completes a circuit on the PCB insert. If the conductive film is worn off, no amount of pushing on the buttons will help.<br /><br />That's when you get a replacement like this one. Worked great for my 2009 Chevrolet HHR. Make sure your'e getting the right type for your vehicle. To install, simply pry your key fob open with a thin, flathead screwdriver and switch out the silicone pad. I actually found that these OEM replacements work better than the ones that General Motors originally used. Don't pay your dealership for an expensive replacement fob when the solution is so cheap and so simple.
B00498A4MS|4|Not quite the same as the Hyundai part but looks to be very good quality.  In fact it looks better made than the original.  Almost every timing component I have purchased from gates (and I have purchased a lot) are very high quality if not OE parts.
B0050IRLSG|5|Picture doesn't match item but was a perfect fit to replace the face shield on my helmet.
B00EKTJEW2|5|Great product just be sure to check if you have a key whole AND/OR a camera!!! I forgot to look and had to order two before I got the correct one but totally my fault! but Product worked great.
B000C94C58|5|Vroom vroom, good upgrade over the factory 2 1/4 piping on my truck.
B0091FJYES|5|Fit perfectly and shipped on time.
B003PJKZHQ|5|This hitch is solid, I have no complaints.
B001LNRRM4|5|Great replacement parts.
B00DBEPAZM|1|Did not fit Nissan Versa Parking Lights.
B00CLUYFNA|5|Fits perfectly in my 2014 Silverado. After watching their excellent installation video, it took only a couple minutes to install.
B000GVA4U4|5|Exactly what I wanted!!
B0002SQZPY|5|works great
B00JMQHUM4|5|Love this
B001AIZ5HY|5|Good product
B004XQCGSQ|5|I liked the sturdiness of the material the license plate. It is easy to clean without eroding the surface. Thanks!
B00T2R8P54|5|We got this for a friend and it works grate for them they were very happy with this product
B009SB70N2|5|Worked great. Just as a word of advice -- don't leave the cam tool installed while you're trying to torque the balancer bolt. I broke the end off the cam trying to do that (and destroyed this tool). Man, that balancer bolt on the Mazdaspeed 6 is a PITA.
B00HQT2768|1|Junk. Tops of the running boards seperated after 4 months.
B002QUJ92C|3|still airflow and water eyes  the Marilyn 2 version fit much better
B00332GMXQ|1|fit good but very flimsy  should have bought the avs brand again  they are very  distorted  if they don't form in after being in awhile ill trash them and buy a better brand
B00JF0LQ9A|5|Great for what I need it for.
B00G23NN0S|1|The red H came off 2 caps in less than 3 weeks.
B00NXRX9AA|4|Perfect fit for my vehicle
B00N5BAWYK|5|So nice u love them a must buy looks just like hids
B002LNGKU8|5|Best leather stuff I've found, use it on motorcycle seat and my leathers.... very happy with all Griot's products... really like the speed shine instant detailer, use it on everything, MC, car, truck and golf car.
B00AN5RSYI|4|Pretty decent brake set for the price.  They are not by any means performance brakes, but they do the job well and survived winter without issue, which is what counts.  Even though these brakes are good, I will most likely spend a little more and get the same brand but the performance series or the ones for a heavy truck.  I do a lot of driving, so good brakes are important to me, especially on the annual road trip where I usually drive half-way around the country with my family.  Definitely better than what i have bought at auto shops in the past (and cost less, to boot!).  Bought for 2002 F150 Supercrew.
B000JKNKXA|5|after reading reviews, I was a little worried about ordering, but did anyway. Pleasantly surprised with ease of installation ,fit and operation was fine.
B000ALJ4MY|4|Chips are a part of life and this is the only repair kit that I have used,  Pretty easy to do and seems to work very well for the chip sizes it indicates on the package.  In a weird stroke of happenstance, one chip I repaired with this kit got hit with another rock in pretty much the center of the original chip.  The repair held strong and there is a very tiny little indentation where the second rock hit (and it hit hard!).  After that, I decided that this repair kit would be the only one I would use and it worth the money.
B00DF7C4LS|5|Worked fine.
B0064IU5FW|5|Worked great on my 2015 canyon.  Throttle response better and firmer shifts!  Increased mpg by 5mpg!  On highway, according to dash!
B00498DHIQ|5|It fit just as the old stock hose did. Worked great
B00FJ6MEU4|4|Does the job for my Thunderheader exhaust  --1996 Road King
B00W31VMYC|5|Works fine
B003C1BGWU|5|This is a great vest. I'm 6'2&#34; 230lbs I ordered the XXL and it fits great.
B001C97V4Q|5|Fits perfect in 2004 SUBARU WRX STi and holds factory temperature.
B006WPQMWM|1|I have used tetford porta potti in my over the road trucks for over 20 years, and this one started to leak after 30 days. Now i have to replace it at my on expense. I am not at all pleased.
B004SSC4MM|5|everywhere I go I get stopped and asked about this key chain.. I have had it for some time now.. and it still looks new..
B007P2ESCC|5|Highly recommend, great performance and sound!
B0022ZK2U4|5|Excellent product for the price, looks great on my DRZ SM. I personally think Acerbis makes the best hand guards on the market.
B000CNBOJ6|5|Great brake pads. Stop my car so much better and it does not squeak.
B00JQZ3HBO|2|only one works :(
B000N3DDI0|5|Perfect fit !
B001DKP0D8|5|I use Pro Long products in any combustion engine I have!  Boat, Car, Truck and even an air compressor!  My 1999 Silverado Pick up has 430,000 miles on it and I have used Prolong engine and transmission products since it came out of warranty .
B007HRUTIC|5|excellent for rv use
B009IMVEL0|5|Good price
B003OFCY9S|5|Very easy to use. I use dupli-color products on everything if I can. Comes out with a lot of pressure and easy to build up layers. First can went quick, be sure to order an extra can just in case.
B00NJXSOW6|5|So many clever comments, waves and &#34;party on&#34; finger wags! Lots of fun.
B00J0E82W0|5|Nice parts great price
B003CN30X6|5|Solid, high quality construction.  A bit challenging to mount, because the configuration is so flexible, but can be adjusted to accommodate any riding postion.  I put these on a 1994 Magna 750C and they fit well, look great and add a nice touch to the bike.
B0009FB758|5|Perfect solution.
B003M0WRIS|5|Look great
B003715H1Q|1|It was just a roll of cheap tape
B001GEWI7W|5|Everything looks great! !
B000C16XM6|5|Quality product & is working great.Had a little trouble getting the old unit out as the window was fully up & i could not get to the two bolts that hold the glass to the unit.
B000WK0LOS|5|very good book. helped a lot. thanks.
B00G49DVGG|5|not bad for what it is. Took some smell out of the vehicle. I think this is a pretty decent product to get a fresh smell going.
B000C8P8WK|5|Exact fit for my 2004 Chevy Classic. I had a insidious seeping leak on my last pan seal that would drip on the garage about once every couple months. Since the vehicle had had a trans service several times prior I wanted to make sure it was not a warped pan lip.  Not sure if the sealing surface/pan lip is same thickness but appears so. Torqued to recommend spec on filter kit  which was not to exceed 12 ft lb.  Stayed around 10ft lb but did notice some slight give in the metal around bolts. (may have been a to tight/ torque wrench out of specs?? Either way all sealed/looks good and no leaks.  Magnet included with pan is about twice the size in area but thinner. Notice the indents in the bottom of the pan in the item description. These denote the corner of the magnet position and keep the magnet from migrating around the pan. Magnet seemed a tad weaker but will do the job.
B00AZ4U43Y|1|That did not fit my taho. 1998
B000R4A4F0|5|Fixed my rattling calipers on my 2008 suburban 2500.
B0006VORDY|5|almost as good as cooking as at home
B0013FXWUG|4|These were a direct replacement and required no modifications to install.
B00FY5VEI8|5|Works like a charm. Rolls up when I don't want the wind in my face and rolls down when I am driving 50mph in deep thought as my hair whispers in the wind breathing the carbon monoxide of the freeway.
B00E58JLL2|5|Replaces the OEM part when the OEM lens falls off.<br /><br />Much more reasonable price than the OEM part and performance is at least as good.
B00KFJSEW2|5|While I was searching for a windshield bag I learned that you want one with velcro on the flaps. This one has it and I love the two pouchs versus three. I was able to run a usb power cord into the pouch through the existing hole in the bottom of the pouch. The hole has rubber to keep it waterproof and it was very tight but I feel sure that it will keep the water out. This is a great product so far.
B00P3XS9M0|5|A must have easy replacement filter! Will eventually pay for itself! Huge difference just in the smell of the car! Looking forward to the easy cleaning and durability this filter delivers!
B00YBHKL1G|5|They surprised me they work well in brilliant sunlight and enhance vision. Very happy with them
B002VW422C|5|Great product
B00W31VMYC|5|This product has been a life safer and the quality is top shelve. Would recommend this product to friends and family... The Bluetooth Scanning tool was everything it says it is. The readings are dead on and just saved us thousands of dollars.
B00ISEPIWK|4|The second one. Worked.
B00EZUL6ZY|3|Doesn't feet really well my RAV4 2015.  But they looks fine
B004MUDN5I|5|Perfect fit good product!
B00B44K6OQ|5|Used these to replace the incandescent lights in my RV. They are better than the 6000K lights and they do not run hot.
B000GZN8BW|5|Still working and looking great
B00JMCCDXE|5|Typically not a Penzoil guy but its oil that is recommended for SRT engines. Did first change @ 600 miles and suspect with the rate I put miles on my car, I'll be changing the oil every 6 months. Surprisingly difficult to find in store but price seems fair and of course Prime shipping is a plus :)
B0053SKJAK|5|Have not had the opportunity to put this item to work. Looks decent and was promptly delivered. My intention is to use it to drain my sump pump during power failures into my sewer which is adjacent to the sump. I am hoping I never have to take it out of the box.
B00XNZ2ZZM|5|Looks awesome in my grill never had a problem never had to adjust it stays where you put it
B0002SA2Z8|5|Can't go wrong with Bestop...great product & great price.  I just wish they'd make a sailcloth version of this 😯
B001Q4UC52|5|Easy install. Looks cool and sound is definitely reduced. Be sure to point the exhaust outlet down for best reduction in noise.
B0087OYNFO|5|fit perfectly, came with all shims and cover and grease. brake softly and quietly.
B0089LTGU2|5|It's exactly what I needed and much, much less than if I bought it at a dealership parts dept.
B0062IJOJ2|5|Awesome cane in on time looks good on the truck
B002FDL3FG|5|Works great
B005G8DBOS|2|Low quality
B00I6JTKSA|2|As another reviewer stated, this set did not come with a rear cargo light. The four bulbs that arrived were all of the same type. They fit the map light and dome light reasonably well. However, the cargo light requires a completely different type of bulb.
B002SJBWOE|5|Really calms the truck suspension down. Bounced it over a few curbs and felt great.
B00SXAI2NG|4|Fleece type cover. The fit of the cover is great in the back of the console but covers the pop-up button in front. Definitely worth the money to protect a dog-kid-everything zone of the car. Washable & well constructed. Beware of rips and tears from dog nails, shoes, velcro etc.
B007LICL56|3|Wouldn't work with my bling plates.
B008ETMV8I|5|Absolutely the best straps to use for your motorcycle.....
B003PJRJXE|4|This hitch was very straightforward to install. 6 bolts through holes that lined up with the vehicle. I thought the price was fair too. Two reasons I didn't give 5 stars. 1. The packaging: it arrived loose inside a cardboard box, and some edges had cut through the box  and as a result the paint had been chipped off in several places. 2. The inside of the receiver tube wasn't fully painted and has already started to rust, and is quite noticeable.
B0014COKYU|5|Kills mold and mildew better than anything else I've ever used.  I can get by cleaning my shower half as often if I use this vs any other cleaner I've tried.  Really is different.
B000CN57Z8|5|Exactly as pictured - four spacers. Use one per side to add no lift, use two per side for roughly 5/8&#34; lift. Regardless, it's a nice replacement for the stock rubber isolators that were worn out on my '98 XJ.
B00G25GOCA|5|I got it.
B0002UEOLO|5|As my hands are not the strongest in the world any longer; this works great on spark plugs in small engines so that they don't seize and you can get them out easily when you need to change them.
B001GPUYZY|1|Do Not buy this item; colors are off.  Waste of money.
B007FSN2UK|5|Works great with my Fiat 500.
B0076NF24I|5|fit perfect fixed my problems shipped fast would buy again.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Drove to Florida and back (Fort Worth) with much rain.  Worked great and all was dry.
B00NXDA088|5|I DID get a little rust on the buckle but it doesn't bother me any.  It will hold a quart of oil or an XL bike cover.
B007TG7HXG|3|Amazon suggested I purchase 19&#34; for my car, and they are too small. The quality is just average, not what I expected.
B000XTHUHE|5|GREAT
B00877SL2M|5|Great product. Use them as tag lights. I like the look it give.
B004Q3OF9O|4|Not necessarily &#34;luxurious&#34; but the silver parts do tend to be less hot than the rest of the wheel cover.
B00EVQHK1Q|5|Awesome sound! Not big fan of three separate instructions that come in kit and an outdated one from Klein that shows sensor that they've since replaced... Was bit confusing, because I thought either I was missing a part or they put the wrong sensor in box. Everything worked out, once I put other two instructions down and just followed the instructions that came with wiring kit.
B004UQQSSI|5|Really cleans the Polishing pads and clothes after Polishing or waxing etc.
B0046ID5EK|1|basura
B00DM9RFJU|4|Just what I wanted
B00691ZQD0|5|Exactly as described.
B007CDF90O|5|Awesome
B00GNHP0WC|2|not what i thought it was ,was way to small ,picture makes it look larger
B00BTLEIIY|5|Fits a 2015 Prius C fine. Easy to install. Only need to cut holes to insert headrests but that is no big deal.
B00NIEATEM|5|excelente
B005C915E4|5|perfect fit. couldn't tell it was replaced...
B008EG66BO|5|Perfect application fit.
B005NYDT7Y|2|The first one did not last a week
B006964UVO|5|It is perfect :)
B008FCDGZ6|5|Works and looks great. I like that you can register both the locks and key, incase you might need to reorder a replacement lock, or key due to damage or loss.
B002R4U72I|5|Stuff looks amazing on my black Thunderheader 2-1 Exhaust  --1996 Road King
B000CCFJCA|5|Great fit and look.  Would buy again.
B004NBDLYE|5|The original shower head in my RV screamed at you the whole time you used the shower.  This item was a wonderful replacement and makes camping even more pleasant.
B00PB4G2FM|5|one of my best online buying experiences...Fedex misdelivered the condenser and then resent it to the seller in error... The seller kindly overnighted me another one while the original condenser was enroute back to them.  I felt like they went above and beyond by doing that.  The actual product itself was an exact fit, easy to install, and my a/c works now.  Thanks!
B001HJR9XE|5|Was all it said it was just less than I really needed my fault
B00UW09ELY|1|Lights flooded after the first rain and filled with condensation to the point of mold. May have been just my order
B0012UFFTS|5|very pleased with product
B00MQ9RAZ6|5|Received in a timely manner and a quality product!
B000L9QRE8|5|Better quality than most hitch locks. Heavy duty.
B0049YBCTG|5|I mistakedly gave a one star it should have been a five they made a difference , came quickly and fit perfect
B004Q7C45C|5|Just what I needed.
B00AAICNPW|5|these tires are amazing can not beat the price. they came in three days and the quality rivals more expensive tires.
B00652G4TS|5|Works nice and fast shipping!!
B009X23B2U|5|It fit perfectly and was easy to install
B00JBI8SJC|2|UPDATE:<br />I installed these lights two years ago. They worked very well for the first year or so. The driver  side low beam has fallen out of adjustment and I am unable to get it dialed in correctly. I have it aimed as high up as it will go, but it still does not light up far enough down the road, as compared to the passenger side. This week the driver side halos also quit working. I verified that they have 12V power but they are dead. On the bright side, they light assemblies themselves still look after two years of service, but they are not holding up well mechanically. Disappointed.<br /><br />Original review:<br />These appear to be the same made in China headlight assemblies sold by another Amazon merchant, that has them listed for 25% more. I decided to give these a try, despite the absence of any previous reviews. I contacted the seller with a question prior to my installation. He replied very quickly. He was polite and helpful.<br /><br />I want to stress that I did not install these lights on a BMW. I own a 2005 diesel motorhome that is equipped with the same style headlight assemblies. There are many RV's of the same era that have this style headlight. I recently decided to covert my headlights to HID's. HID bulbs in my stock headlight assemblies did not disperse the light well so I took my mod a step further and searched for a nice looking headlight assembly with projection lenses.<br /><br />There were some fitment issues with these assemblies. I was forced to make mods to the assemblies as well as the lower assembly mounting brackets. Again, a BMW owner may not face these issues, but I did with my application.<br /><br />These lights look attractive and do an excellent job of projecting my HID's.  The integrated halos look cool, but they could be brighter IMO. All in all, these are very nice lights for the money. Time will tell if they hold up well to the elements.
B006R34PB4|5|easy to install and bright. Works well. not defective. arrived in timely manner.
B00FX40B16|4|My main criticism of this wiper blade is that the installation instructions are not especially clear. I ended up looking up an instructional video on the web to figure out how to remove my old blade and install the new one. If you're an old pro at changing wiper blades, then you probably won't have any issues. Once I figured out the basics, it was fairly easy to swap out the blades.<br /><br />I live in a fairly arid environment, so we don't use our wiper blades with much frequency, but I've been pleased with the fit and performance so far. They do a good job of clearing the windshield and providing good visibility.
B007N6YSCU|5|perfect fit. easy to install
B008VGRMJC|4|Fits pretty good, doesn't account for the angle side of the visor but it holds cds and mail :)
B0029TQDLA|4|Serves the purpose.
B000C9PTRI|1|The pic is for the idler pulley. What is actually shipped is the belt tensioner pulley and even the part box from AC Delco is marked as an idler pulley. The part in the box is not grooved, but flat. I also ordered the tensioner pulley from Dayco at the same time and the 2 parts were identical.
B0011E2Y0I|5|A no brainer here. Its good stuff!
B000CITK8S|1|Steer clear of this product,  will kill y out r batteries. I had to buy a new battery after putting this tender on it for a couple of months. Battery was near five years old, so I thought it was the battery. Got the new one, everything was ok, put the tender on it, went out after a week of being on the tender, and the new battery is dead. Product is garbage. I am sad that I bought 2 of them.
B00V4KUG4A|5|Product was easy to install and works perfectly.  Would recommend.
B001NI7KE2|5|Works great! Perfect in my line of business with lots of apparel samples. Wish I would have bought one sooner!
B0040DX7EO|5|I've had one of these since 2005 and everyone makes fun of me for the &#34;huge mirror&#34; until they try it. Then, they buy one for themselves. No blind spots!
B007PLZGO2|5|cops love it
B001NZKNHG|5|A+
B009QP5UAU|5|Orderd for my Gf she loves it.
B005S0DMDY|5|Prompt delivery and good quality
B00AEWIZMY|5|It didn't really fit the back seat but I made it work . I love it.
B00HSTX274|5|Same as the other one Proud to be an American,and Proud to show it
B002G2261G|5|Good quality!
B002RSIK4G|5|Sealing things on your RV's aluminum roof get done right with this stuff. I covered all the seams and the installed items on our RV roof with it and it seals out moisture GREAT&#62;
B000BWCG4U|5|It worked perfect,Easy to install.
B000M61JFC|5|AAAA++++
B000KYXDYQ|5|Great item. Replaced lost fob. Works great. Priced right. Ships from Canada so let them know how to ship if you need it quick.
B0002NYBVY|5|AAAA++++
B00PE0JPFW|5|Great product! It does clean everything out and work exactly how it is suppose too! Would recommend product!
B00B5J2C2E|5|Put 4 of these on my Jeep along with a 52 inch Lightbar. The 3&#34; LED's are working like they should and have had no problem with them so far.<br />These have been on my jeep for about 9 months so far and have been thru rain and everything else and are still working properly.
B000VUEC30|5|Excellent product and excellent transaction,,, Thanks!!!
B000JLNBW4|1|This was a surprise for my wife to have on a bookshelf, no problem with ventilation. Anyway it is not cold enough for her soft drinks. I took ac curate temperature readings of inside with mercury thermometer 58 degrees. Opened a can and measured liquid with dipstick type thermometer and it was 59 degrees. The Koolatron is a excellent designed unit. Latch is ok, quality is good. I would buy again if it was colder.  Thank you.  Michael Taylor. San Diego
B00GSAUHB8|3|It seems well made, unlike the last one I got for my car from a different manufacturer. Otherwise, it turned out to be larger than expected and doesn't fit my car. These are generously sized. If you have an older car, there doesn't seem to be anything available that will fit and last more than a year or two.
B003WDEYPE|5|Just plugged it in and everything seems to work great.
B000E1D2UK|5|Item as described. Installation took about 45 minutes.
B00L7TQOX0|4|Trying their coated product for first time - at 2 months of use - no rust!  My previous set was non-coated Brembo rotors, and they began rusting immediately, and looked terrible when looking through the alloy wheels.  I hope the new rotors continue looking great!<br /><br />Brembo rotors last long time without excessive warping.
B00N191SF8|5|Perfect for what I needed them for. Used them to build a tire carrier for my sxs and it turned out great.
B00TF7BVWK|4|I had the impression it would be a little more rigid than it is. But still find it useful for what I paid
B000COBGIO|1|Is not the right fit for my van
B00DSGHP7O|5|Love this stuff. No other oil performs as well in my 2009 Triumph Street Triple R. The engine runs smooth, cool and quiet. The big difference is in the clutch, where the Pro Plus makes shifting, smooth, light and quiet.
B00BD5GZTG|5|Grandson was thrilled!
B00LEBLI82|5|They look great and you can't bear the price.
B00VTZ2LRU|5|Although, the part arrived on time, it didn't resolve the problem (none of the passenger windows worked)
B00U4NZMYM|5|Highly recommend
B002W0W2AM|5|Used this on my Corvette and works great.  Left a wet look shine and I also use 921 detail spray between polish and leaves car looking great.  Very easy to apply
B00HWI3D1G|5|Installed the pair very easy, only had to make one drill hole for each side. Looks good on the vehicle
B00KWGU71Y|3|KEEPS CRAP AND THUS RUST FROM COMING IN THRU THE FRONT END OF MY HITCH RECEIVER...
B000CIKBRM|5|easy installation, works great
B00IX0CRQO|5|Ez to install and very good ride I like it
B000OO0XN6|4|As described
B001V8UKBY|5|Great to have in an emergency
B007UTFJHS|5|Worked great.
B00K16FPO4|1|Save you money and go with surf city black max or a mothers product. Product did arrive quickly as described in normal Amazon fashion. Product was just crap.
B007JMTSTQ|5|As promised, it fits my Badlands 12000lbs winch perfectly!!
B000F09CF4|5|This product is beyond a doubt the very best penetrating oil I have ever used. I'm a retired machine repairman after 24 years of experience on all types of machines  from hand held to 350 ton stamping presses.  I cannot say enough about Aero kroil and the job it does and the time loss and headaches it stops. Hands down and without a doubt the very best product I have ever used... Do not pass this product up..you will not be sorry!
B00XKY89AG|4|Not bad for the money. I find it useful.
B00MB0EX46|5|Love this stylish, metal license plate with its crystal bling!  It looks great on my black sports car!
B000GV6UIE|5|This was for my son and he said it worked great. Excellent buy, I saved several dollars compared to the price that Ebay had it for.
B009TKYUE4|5|as described, no issues
B00DIBIDAW|2|Transponder won't link to the keeps system. Even after following the instructions and several youtube videos nothing happened. I'm going to have to take it to the dealership to have it computed.
B007JMOSAA|5|Purchased to fit a Superwinch Tigershark 9500 and it fit perfectly. Great price and quality so bought another as a spare.
B005FQTNQG|2|Top lid broke after first use. Pretty cheap. I can still use it but disappointed for sure. Not made in the same vain as a Mercedes car - that's for sure!
B00HB9HSPI|5|Great product.
B003ZJ2IQM|5|These can't be beat if you want to keep your inside temp down in the summer without letting the rain in. Fourth vehicle I've installed these on and it's so easy every time.
B005ETO8ZU|5|Just like OEM for my 07 BMW E90 335xi.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Love them!
B00LW6OBOM|2|front seats are decent but I can't get the back seat covers to fit.
B0007LZK9I|5|Price was good and didn't break
B00GHT5XVY|5|works perfect and very fast shipping thank you
B007WIB5ES|5|It fits perfectly I didn't even have to use the velcro!
B00UWRB8OS|5|Just smaller that I imagined and the one I replaced.
B001C8WP9I|5|I really like these pads so far on my 2014 Z51.  Very powerful with minimal dust and noise relative to their aggressive nature.  Can't wait to get on the track and see if they hold up.  Try them.
B00V5QDIPW|5|As a phantom 3 pilot I wanted a way of looking after my quadcopter props in the event of a misshap. These guards are very easy to fit and adding or removing is very straightforward.
B005PZMLDY|5|exelent
B000OWBSBY|5|Works great! Thanks
B0043000G2|5|Perfect
B001TM3Q3G|3|The seat covers are very nice.  Not sure if they had the car model correct for the backseat.  The bottom seat doesn't come out and I don't have a middle headrest.  I just made it work.
B007FFDOK6|1|The foam float shrank like it had been dipped in solvent.  I replaced the float from a stock BMW unit, and it operated for a few months, but now the switch itself has failed.  My advice is to go OEM.
B000KIPV42|5|Excellent seller recommend
B000C809HY|5|Thermostat fit 2004 Kia Sorento and is working great.
B00SZK1420|5|Installed on a 2015 Chevrolet Silverado, no issues at all!! easy install. They match perfectly with the OPT7 LED H11 low beams that i also purchased. Couldn't be happier!
B005HQLE7U|4|It would be better if comes with customer choice of color! Over all it's alright!
B00358O99C|3|I have had these on my 09 vstar for about a month now, in the beginning they were loud, mean, and raspy. I've been notice now that they mellowed out and sound more like a atv exhaust and doesn't have the raspy throaty sound as much as it did. Can anyone enlighten me if I did something wrong?? I have stock air cleaner on bike too. Are my baffles on to tight??
B00A7YVPPS|5|No issues or worries about cargo moving around with these tightned down. Built and works well.
B0033YK9A6|5|Easy installation and fit like a factory part.
B005KHBG0G|5|Nice ramp for the price of $70. Easily wide enough for any motorcycle.
B0006MWPZU|5|have a bad back and helps in long rides when I travel.  price is decent too
B000GTVOZU|5|great
B00HKTVKLM|5|these are great, the first pair I install is working since 10 months ....
B000S2P72Q|5|Identical to the factory install.<br />Don't try to follow the factory wiring path.  Just get this thing from point A to point B.  Plenty of extra slack.
B00GPUIZ4C|5|Exactly what it said
B00OYMABM2|3|EeThe item look nice when it came with the paint quickly started to chip off from the face of it
B007VR9PGK|5|Exactly what I needed great price couldn't be happier
B005ASY23I|4|good
B004G5A7NU|1|I ordered Q-HY-1500L which is shown to be 4000lb capacity.  I received 684-Q-HY-1500s which according to the decal on the jack has a capacity of 1000kg or 2200lb.  I am returning the item.
B00OPOUW32|5|My wife loves this ...
B009E9MFP6|1|I can't get it to program! I guess I will take it to a Chevrolet Dealer to get it programmed.
B000I7YOI4|4|The RustBlast worked OK... and I'd probably consider purchasing it again.
B000CONKFG|5|This worked perfectly on my 1970 Mustang.
B00K1IL32U|4|Works perfectly in the back passenger window of the car
B0023VDLOQ|5|a little expensive,but so far they are great and delivered quickly.
B00G620ZVU|5|I replaced my older Polaris lights with these and they're are almost too bright. I have only risen a couple times with the lights so I can't yet speak on the durablity, but these lights are amazing clear and bright compared to the older yellowed out lights I had.
B000EQVXQ0|5|good
B00KN0UOEE|1|Good value
B00YLZ7C3S|1|to small would not hold a purse
B006GR2C3O|5|This is a well made and not some flimsy tire cover. The graphics are excellent, and it fit like a glove. I also get a lot of compliments and comments on the subject nature as well.
B00CSWEJZU|5|works
B000C83R1E|1|Not the right one for my Jeep.  Don't know what this on fits but it doesn't work for my Jeep.
B000EPP6JG|5|Perfect
B00L22F2E4|5|Works as it should. Good quality but time will tell how the sun effects it.
B0054FJEDK|5|VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !!
B0031G8GME|5|This was incredibly easy to install. Put it in my '15 Forester within minutes... I'd advise buying a door panel remover along with this. Helped a ton.
B002QAU7P0|5|Very nice bed protector will recommend to anyone with a dodge ram 1994-2001
B007HRVMMY|5|Had to replace the exterior shower on my tent camper and Palomino told me they use Lasalle Bristol.  Easy to install and it fits exactly.
B001O15D7E|5|Perfect fit.
B004UFUYIO|5|perfect fit!  large when folded up but this it the only shade that fits this window.  I recommend this for all E53s
B001QFGMQE|4|Easy to install and feels sturdy. The plastic caps could could have been a bit cleaner but very happy with order.
B000RDAKXW|4|Fits my 2006 Jeep Commander nicely and had no issues at the mechanics. Not much more to say, because it's a radiator. I do recommend to place in garage or other well ventilated area, as it's off-gassing will remind you of Harbor Freight.
B00HQRVA9U|5|fit great and looks good! So far has held up good!
B008L4YWNI|1|Was very disappointed and would not order from them again. The packing job was very poor which resulted in dents and dings all over one rotor which was purely cosmetic but should not of happend. Besides that I've had both rotor profesionally installed with new pads and I continue to hear loud horrible scraping sounds in lower speeds.  I would recommend spending the extra buck and buying name brand the first time so you won't be stuck paying for them twice like I now have to.
B005J8UEEU|5|Exactly what I need for my project truck!
B002UC8MW4|4|I picked up the 3/8 crimps from an auto parts store for around 3.50 so don't be worried about that.  You need to plan on the depth of the switch.  To flush mount it you will need about 3/8 to a 1/2 inch clearance (possibly a bit more) behind the switch to clear the posts and the back of the switch.  I used a surface mounted switch box and a wall switch plate (modified) under this switch to give it the depth for mounting it in my camper without having to carve into the wall.  You could do something similar with a wood block or etc.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it did not come with hardware to mount it so you will need to provide your own screws,  it did match the other switches on my 2015 Grand Design 380TH.
B000BZL8UU|4|Seemed like a decent quality part to replace a Motorcraft pump with.  Ford actually used Bosch pumps in several of their vehicles.
B010FPKKEK|5|Documentation could use some help, but went on in about 10 minutes and works like I hoped.
B00FBKJ2BW|5|it worked great . It was very simple to apply the computer chip  back into the new casing, less than a minute.
B00C9SWRES|5|love it
B007ACZTGQ|4|A bit heavy for an ultralight tiny camper trailer, but an excellent product - comes with a nice carrying case, which I'm not sure how useful the case is since I'm keeping all elements of the combo pack on the trailer.  Glad I have it.
B00ODRY4EY|1|Didn't fit and I can't return it!! Really pissed and would like money back ASAP!
B00N48R34G|5|Work great
B00Y5I61F6|5|Looks great next to the Jeep Logo. on the front hood bug shield.
B005ONBXB8|5|Color matching from website to my vehicle was perfect and the part arrived quicker than I wanted to install it.
B002R155Q4|5|loking exelent
B00GOLGCY2|5|Good cheap filter
B009DJTMAI|5|ok
B00LL6PK2K|5|This item is a &#34;must have&#34; for all cars because you can never be too careful when you're out driving. When we first got our SUV, we never worried about our tire pressure because we got it brand spanking new. On our way to an appointment that's 4 hours away from our home, one of our brand new tires got busted. Since we were in the middle of nowhere, having taken one of the backroads to go to our appointment, it was difficult for us to get any help from our insurance company. Moral of the story is....check your tire pressure gauge before going on road trips - regardless of how new/old your vehicle is. Also, get a Tire Pressure Gauge that is as user friendly and accurate as this one from Federico's Car Care! Well priced, well made and very reliable!<br /><br />As a blogger, I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies for review purposes.

B004I8M03K|1|What junk you could not even see the road at night. Returned and got Factory New
B00RV417XM|5|Good quality
B003JP00OY|4|Decent quality for the price.  Performs as expected.  A bit nicer looking and it would have got 5 stars.
B00HS5NZ7A|5|perfect fit
B0022UP8XA|5|Fits perfect
B009XA8GB8|5|Perfect!
B00MAQCGNQ|4|Fit pretty Well
B006WQRH8Y|5|Great price perfect fit on my wheel.
B00HCTICTI|5|Very easy to install, after watching online videos explaining how to (&#34;so easy, even a teenage girl can do it!&#34;). The only help I needed (for safety) was to have someone hold up the hatch while I changed out the parts.
B00R6XE8CU|5|Neat. Husband hates it...but that was to be expected. I love it!
B00IOFVV9M|2|these dont fit a 05 lexus is300 very good. i had to kind of warp them to the shape of the door and they wound up being about a half an inch too short also. since they were so cheap i felt i could live with them for now. you get what you pay for people!
B0083W18IU|5|Other than feul line hook up was different but was able to resolve it, it worked great.
B00IKSLLAW|2|Plastic nod said
B0002SR63E|2|Way too expensive for what it is.  I've figured out how to make my own Bend-a-light/borelight out of PVC pipe, Romex cable, a thin wire and an LED.
B001U8MPMM|1|Does NOT fit a 2001 Acura CL even though I entered the specifics in before I ordered and it said it would fit this make and model. The zippers broke with installation attempt. One of the straps popped. Poorly stitched. No accommodation for seat belt guide on side of front seats so we had to make holes for them. Buyer beware! I'm sorry I spent my hard earned money on this knock off, want to be &#34;pleather&#34; seat covers.
B003VY8I6A|5|Perfect love them..
B008KV4GCO|5|Worked and fit perfect,changed it in about 15 minutes.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Quick and easy setup...it only took me 30 seconds to programmed it. Works great!!!!
B004K23HXQ|1|Does not fit under my seat.
B00E9SOVW2|3|materiel inside guards is very allergical for my skin. i  can't wear it but feat very good.
B00LPSOAX4|5|GOOD TOOLS VERY HELPFUL
B00NH78IAC|5|My part was shipped on time and fit perfectly.
B00CIC43BU|1|Battery was easy to install but did not last even one year.  There were no power outages to explain this.  I won't use again.
B0050SYPYE|4|The connector was little tight but able to push it in. It works perfectly!
B008HY9CIW|5|Exactly what I wanted bought 1 to see if I liked it then bought other cause it's great
B00E5OUOCQ|3|Its easy to use but is too small for a 2013 Camry.
B000C2Y5IY|5|Great quality hose that exceeds the original GM quality.  I have used this brand for decades on several different vehicles, and the quality is still there.
B00E1D4YXG|5|Fits great and looks good. Everything I was expecting
B0006I0N3U|5|My little travel trailer that I bought didn't have these on it and it made it hard to get stuff in and out of the storage compartments.  I used some caulking tape behind these, because I had some left over from the hot water heater that I installed in the trailer earlier, but the spongy double stick tape would have worked just as well to supplement the screws.  You probably don't even need the tape but an once of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  It's amazing how something as simple as this can make things so much easier and convenient.
B00GX4Y9AY|5|very handy unit
B009IJQ8HS|3|First and foremost, Supreme Hardware will not accept the return once you opened it. The main issue I have is the reel is enclosed in a confined and compact space. It will fit the &#34;completely dried hose. If you are reel in the &#34;flat&#34; hose that contain even some amount of undrained water, you will have to crank the poorly designed reel handle to get about 80% of hose into the reel with some serious effort. After that, you can take a break for a while before the rest of hose can be reeled in place. The bottomline, this product is compact but not necessarily save you time...
B0052FRX9E|4|For like $16 and some change shipped to my door for a non-OEM product there's not much to complain about. Considering if you want the real deal from an auto parts store it'll cost ya $50+ dollars. So it's worth the small price and a 5 min YouTube video on replacing the Handel and Bessel.
B00VJ4LHUS|3|Nice trash bag with good quality material. The only down side is that the tissue boxes keep sliding out of the holder regardless of the size.
B00KY0K1Q4|5|Worked out just fine.  No issues with packing or connections.
B00L40ZQGS|1|I try to find something good about everything I buy. But there is nothing good to say about this product.<br />It is a flimsy, cheap, haphazardly made piece if garbage.<br />I bought it to help circulate the A/C in my van, but I could do far better with a folded piece of paper.<br />On high, you could hear it running, but you would be hard pressed to feel any air come out of it!<br />I should have sent it back, but I was so mad, that I threw the whole thing in the garbage on the way into the grocery store.<br />I am amazed that ANYONE could give this piece of garbage a good review.<br />Sorry but I do not know how the people who sell this can sleep at night<br />Even if someone gave me one for free, I would still consider it a total loss!
B00MROR4IS|5|Great color match, easy application, looks good as new. Thanks again!
B000C9GYOA|5|right fit, right price
B00P0766Y2|5|Is ok
B00YI3IGA6|5|Affordable and easy to use. Great buy!
B00MTZ9PUA|2|Before ordering I called to make sure this starter would support a reverse function on my GoldWing. I was assured it would. After many hours of installing the starter, reverse does not engage! Now I have to take the starter back out and install a new one ... let's hope it is the right one this time!
B002N5DE2G|5|Nice assortment of fuses which are always good to have on hand when camping.
B0049U6EYS|1|Worse ride with these struts. Replaced one year after buying and felt major improvement.  These are garbage
B00T2GT9L4|4|This helped me jumo start a 27ft sailboat diesel engine. Regular batteries from Costco. I'll probably be getting another one to leave on the boat. Great size when storage is tight!
B004HE3WAA|5|Fit perfectly.
B0009IBJAS|5|works great
B00144FZUG|4|WORKS GREAT
B00CEXKBS2|3|the front passenger didn't fit well and the two rear ones lost their shape.<br />seems like they warped from the heat.
B00WNGV0WG|4|Good product overall and fit my car seat( Graco). I only wish the edge of the tray can be higher. Sometimes, when I brake the car suddenly, the food or toy on the tray will slide down.
B004O844EM|5|Some of the holes don't line up 100% but with a little force they'll line up for the install bolts. Works great otherwise and easy to install on the rack.
B00R3QUZ8Q|1|It does not stock as it should..
B00VPOJC0Y|5|Aweome looking decal.  Looks great on our laptop.  Worked just like the instructions said, we had no problems with application.
B005U9JH6O|5|This is a great item
B00OI73P6M|1|I bought this kit to repair small dents in an aluminum door.  I mixed the resin with the hardener as per the instructions but the product was not the correct consistency for this job; it ran right down the door rather than staying in the dented areas, which I had sanded with 80 grit sandpaper and cleaning with acetone prior to attempting to fill with Bondo product.  I wound up wiping off as much as I could before it set.  Is there another Bondo product I should have used instead?  I wound up having to clean and re-sand the door, which is now lying in a sorry state in my garage why I decide what to do next.  What a mess.
B0002JMIEK|5|Makes the car look new!
B000KL5DXI|5|Perfect fit!
B011JA8BVE|5|With our family's two Kindles, an iPad and multiple phones, outlet space in the car is at a premium. This 4-Port charger from KRIEGER may have been the only thing that made an 11-hour drive this week bearable -- No more fighting over the outlet and no one's electronics ran out of juice!<br /><br />What sets this charger apart from others I've used is that it charges fast! The 9.6A capacity means all four plugged-in devices -each- get 2.4 amps. (Other mobile plugs I've used have a fast slot... and a slow slot,) This means you're able to play AND charge at the same time. The big complaint with my previous charger was that on some iPad games, it couldn't keep up... the battery percentage would just tread in place while charging and playing.<br /><br />Build quality is great; the plastic housing feels well put-together and it fits nice and snug in the charger port. There are also a couple blue LEDs in the USB bank that come on when it's plugged-in; helps you remember it's active.<br /><br />I received an evaluation unit in exchange for sharing my opinion.
B00PCL9DTQ|1|Very cheap and one was cracked
B003NDI6V6|3|Installation in my g37xS went okay. Took a few hours with some cutting to make it fit. Read the forums for information on these. They sound  amazing. Bogs down in hot or wet weather, but on cooler days it screams. I feel I lost a bit if low end torque and power and a bit at the top of the rpm range. Upper middle rpms feel stronger. It sounds killer and turns heads. Sounds like chewbacca. I think it adds power by taking some away in the process of shifting it in the range. Keep your stock intake and use a dry afe filter instead.  I will be putting mine back on when I get my catback.
B00KT0P0JM|5|Met my expextativas , excellent
B00KL3ALGO|5|This has been a great product for my family.  My 7-month old is well protected from the bright sun.  The product is well-made and affordable.  I plan on buying another set for my husband's car.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B0009OR91A|5|AAAA++++
B00CDY1DFW|1|Horrible no parts were assembled to connect the rear shocks.
B00H6XPZN6|3|Sticks pretty well but is entirely opaque. It is a bit of a hazard from the driver's perspective.
B003BZQ7IU|5|excellant
B0018C85VK|5|Works good
B00XPL88NC|5|The tire pressure gauges are perfect! Hubby always likes to check the tire pressue on our autos and trailers. It's a wonderful product, it's easy to use, and we received excellent customer service from the company!!! Recommended absolutely!
B00OP9WB2C|5|just like the pic and is holding up well
B00KGNVWEY|1|The first time I pulled out of the garage, the center caps flew off the car and I was only able to find 2 of the 4 of them. They should have fit but they just didn't stay in. Wish I could return them but I don't have all of them to return. Pretty sub-par product!!!
B004JC19RI|4|Easy to apply, and looks good once applied.
B00JYEIL9K|5|Installed this on my 2004 F150 FX4 Super Crew 5.5 foot bed.  The info about this particular item said it would not fit my truck but it did perfectly.  Check out the instructions to make sure it fits yours.  I had to cut the mid pipe as per the instructions to fit mine.  To remove existing exhaust be sure to remove all bolts from clamps and take out all the hangers.  You might also want to cut the original exhaust behind the muffler to make easier removal.  Installing the new was really easy except for getting the new pipe onto the existing pipe (the first pipe you install...), it required lots of elbow grease.  After that getting everything in and secure was easy, it fit perfectly. As for the exhaust once installed, all I have to say is &#34;wow&#34;!  This looks great and sounds awesome.  Not too loud but has a great rumble.  I think my neighbor liked my truck so he got an Raptor and the exhaust an that thing is mean as hell so I just had to upgrade mine.  This is not as mean sounding as the Raptor but just enough for a single pipe.  My intent was not to compete with the Raptor but be more respectable, this met the bill.  As for improved throttle response, yes, this exhaust made my truck feel as though it was no longer driving under water.  As for improved gas mileage, let's be honest, you don't get exhaust like this to improve mileage.  If you are like me you are going to be peddle to the metal all the time so you can hear the rumble. Overall great upgrade.  Recommend!!!
B00WFIL1D0|4|Over all the gizmo work real well
B007Y85G5K|5|I bought it a month ago and its been working fine. And it arrived real fast.
B00009AOCF|5|Works wonders on the interior of my car.
B00FZJPETI|5|I received this item very quickly from Amazon for my wife's 4 Runner. They look great and the installation was easy taking about 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. All of the bolts and brackets necessary for the installation was included. There were also step by step directions and pictures of the installation  but the pictures were not very clear. Either way it was pretty self explanatory. The fit and finish of the steps are great. Just one item of caution, I called Amazon and asked if I was receiving 1 step or a pair of steps and Amazon said it was one step and that I needed to order 2. After I received both boxes I opened on and a pair of steps is included in one box, so I received a total of 4. So if you order be sure to only order 1 as there is a pair in each box.
B0000AY4YJ|5|So far it has met all my expectations. The vinyl seats on our pontoon stay clean longer & clean up faster.
B001AV1WP0|5|Great
B000CCOL3I|4|I would buy again,but no earth shattering results.
B00I82D1ZI|1|received wrong size lugs from what i ordered
B00PCEG7A6|1|Does not work with auto up/dn windows.  Tried everything I can think of and short of pushing on the glass when you power them up nothing works.
B00E5XGETY|5|Very east to install it's actually a skunk 2 shifter which was nice for the price...
B00L9EPHSQ|4|match the car, nice
B00LOR5NF0|5|Good value, looks good put on 2009 JK no complaints since they went on today.
B00YB5GAEA|2|Great, bright light, love that it's rechargeable. BUT the attachment to the rubber band is weak and the light and housing has fallen off twice previously when riding over rough road, and yesterday fell off without me detecting it and is gone forever. Somebody out there has a nice flashing red light, but no way to attach it to anything. I now have a fancy rubber band.
B007A3N1CE|5|Better than expected!
B0115Q19FM|5|Exactly as shown, good looking finish and not to large that it hides the renewal sticker.  Would buy again.
B007WWU79S|5|Really good stuff. Each roll will do about 5 regular toolbox drawers. Durable, lays flat and keeps things from rolling around so much.
B00B2AZM9Q|5|Very nice
B002L6DMD8|4|Did the job as expected. Only a few hundred miles since installation with no noise, excess dust or regrets yet.<br />The delivery was also on time. Very Happy.<br />I also ordered brake pads which were the incorrect ones so had to go pick em up local.<br />I returned the pads, seems to have been a good transaction just waiting for  credit adjustment.<br />Would do it again but would verify parts more accurately.
B00475LKO4|5|love this.. haven't' seen anyone else with it yet..
B003JBZ2T6|1|Cast steel shims. They broke when installed.<br />Forged, billet shims do not break.
B00QOBPJXW|5|Keep in mind that more expensice bulbs are not necessarily better. This one is a good value.
B004SSDL8S|4|Good size for the seat of a sportbike: not too big or small. Could be better with Molle on top or some way of securing other items to it.
B000IXUBIA|5|Perfect part. Perfect price.
B00AQ2G4Q6|5|The product was received as expected, in a timely manner and well protected by packaging. Definitively, I would recommend this to a friend.
B008G2GF3U|5|Thanks jyst what i needed
B00VNBDWPK|4|Does improve viewing distance, the light is bright. It makes the other lites appear dim. I purchased headlights and fog light. Each box had a defective bulb. I contacted the company and reached out to me and express mailed replacement. So kudos to them for having a great customer service department.
B00AM7GYR4|5|Worked well on my ford explorer 2015. Not bad for price.
B00SO1YXY6|1|Awful product do not buy!!!
B000VKVXOG|5|Fits 2005 Scion XB cabin location (behind glove box).  I didn't even know I had a cabin filter location until I was installing a car stereo and found the box, which apparently came empty from the factory as I bought my car new and there was no filter installed!  In any case, this thing fits just like it should and doesn't break the bank.  Install is super easy, just pop out the glove box and it's right behind it.  Don't pay a shop for this!
B006DEVM1S|5|Great product n timely delivery
B000YJDC5C|5|good stuff
B0009IQZFM|5|AWESOME! use this at the car wash a couple times a week and it does a great job!
B002MEWYCY|4|Everything worked out fine, good fit I just had to adjust them to the correct height, they were very low.
B00J8WJT1C|5|It speaks for itself.
B0071F5GSS|5|Outstanding
B000SL4AA2|5|nice compressor have not used it yet
B004YID4DY|5|Love it
B0028ZKMM6|5|This was just barely long enough but since it was I am sure glad I got it. It sure saved time from finding and putting all the pieces together.
B00H7QZSOS|1|Very cheap low quality material. Haven't use it yet the material is bent already.  Tried using it and due to the inferior quality of the product, the key fob would get stuck inside the key hole.  I threw mine away after one try.
B00VBJXVHS|5|Excellent!!
B004GCHBAU|4|not as good as the original but good enough to drive.
B00L6Z85RI|5|Great bags and great fit for my 72 T-Tops
B005MRDBKC|5|Fit and finish was top notch. If you have ever installed window tint (easy, just be patient!) You can install lamin-x.<br /><br />I ordered clear and thats what it is. These gave my slightly pitted European Code headlights a new shine, and seems thick enough to protect from harsh road debris.
B000F0Z81G|4|Works for Tacoma perfectly
B003FWNWN2|5|I use this inverter for my portable photo booth and it has held up very well in inclement conditions for a couple of months now.
B00HFHBLEA|4|I didn't end up using it, but it looks real sturdy. I was happy with the purchase.
B0044GB6MM|5|Perfect replacement driver's side window regulator for the 2001 Ford F150!!
B00I0H26WU|4|nice fit but not exactly easy to install.
B000RN4FK6|5|For the price, these bags are GREAT.  I have them mounted on my '02 Suzuki Bandit S 1200.  Since these are universal mount, the straps and fasteners just did not do it for me so I fabricated some simple brackets and they look like they are made for the bike.  After nearly 2 seasons of use, they have held up great. A little sun-faded but structurally sound.  They hold everything I need to carry for work, and a 6 pack (bottles) fits comfortably in each. I had food in one of the bags and a critter of some sort chewed through the top right near the zipper.  The cost of repairing it is more than buying a new pair, so I am happily placing an order for replacements. 2016 Update:  on 3rd set since I ripped the right side bag off bringing the Bandit off the center stand too close to the garage shelf.  Still very happy with these bags and will try to live and learn and make this set last a while longer.
B0066CPGKK|3|bought this coffee maker for camping its not that bad.. i find it very handy yet very fragile...
B000C5E3H4|5|As described.
B004AGTWMM|5|Had 1 of these mugs for years but it was getting old and tatty, like it as its microwavable.<br />I couldn't find 1 anywhere,<br />Then i found these, so well happy.<br />Quick delivery, happy customer
B0064MK44A|3|Ok
B00KO59DKO|5|gave to my mom to keep on her keys. good gift. made of sturdy plastic
B001QFD7YE|4|You have to use one of the old ends.
B000CMH52W|5|I think these should deter most thieves
B007GCDVC4|1|Only powers APC Back-UPS Pro 1500 for 2 minutes. Computer instantly shuts down every brownout because the computer thinks the battery is about to die. APC utility also shows only 4 minutes of available runtime. Now I have to pay for recycling of this doorstop. Just bought other battery for sale on Amazon (at twice the price).
B007S0LDME|5|We used the cheap pouch chemicals they work but after a few days you tend to get some smell.  With this we get no odors.  I will purchase it again after this is out.
B008AF7640|4|Purchased and used these lights to replace the OEM beat up fog lights on my Chevy S10 Xtreme. To my surprise for as inexpensive as they were, they work great and are very bright! Only complaint I have is the mounting bracket. It's cheap and can be a hassle to get tight enough to hold its position, with a little patience it is possible tho. That's the reason for the 4 stars. I can't speak on the wires or switch that came with the kit, because I tapped into the prexisting OEM harness and switch.  Am posting pics because it doesn't seem anyone has yet to. Hope this review helps!
B0025272PW|5|Easy to install and fits well.
B0019IGSC6|1|Part arrived the day after I ordered it. Shipping was prompt. Upon opening the box, I found that the axle had fallen apart. There was grease all over the inside of the box. No apparent damage to the outside of the box. Upon closer inspection I found that the inner grease cap had popped off and the shaft trunion pushed through, inverting the rubber boot.
B00BYGMH6O|3|Looks good but to expensive
B00266YNUE|5|Awesome fit. Great price.
B00FGJHG3E|5|Work great! They really hold my toolbox in place and the deep u-shape prevents the bolt from bending my truck body.
B000C5I6FE|5|good product
B0089LXY9Q|5|Awesome!
B00QN8DD16|5|Beautiful design and everyone compliments it!
B000C9FE3C|5|works. for this part that is all that matters
B000NWA6T0|5|Perfect fit at a great price. Took care of my engine light.
B006O85ADO|5|great quality chain... I will only use these when running High horsepower bikes
B005X9WSLW|5|Great product although hard to find.  Caps are always loose on this product .  New formula is not as good I believe as an auto detailer owner.
B00BC372EG|5|Good fit, and a solid helmet. Good bang for your buck!  Good heavy solid helmet!
B006R34PB4|5|Work like a charm.
B003CNFFPC|3|these gaskets work with extra care and concern, make sure to rough up mating surfaces with flat files or light use of emery cloth.
B00GXX9HK2|4|Nice
B00L32M39K|5|Great item<br />Really  happy with it<br />Thanks
B00CJ3WVXK|3|Installed it as blinker lights (tail light) replacing OEM bulbs on my 2003 Lexus LS430. Prior to placing an order i had asked the Amazon community whether i need to install a load resistor and couple responded and confirmed that it doesn't need a load resistor as this LED bulb is plug-and-play, etc. However, my blinkers are hyper flashing with the LED bulbs installed and will need to install a load resistor or just accept hyper flashing as the load resistor gets very hot with very limited option due to my vehicle's taillight design.
B000KID2ZC|5|very pleased with the tool and simple to use
B00B7WYIIK|4|Shipping was two days ahead of schedule can't complain about that.all the parts work fine but the adjuster sleeves there about 5&#34; long an the ones on my truck are about 14&#34; so can't use them but everything else perfect
B00ZY1L7G6|5|Works perfectly, great design if you're a classy individual with a mind geared towards being successful in life.
