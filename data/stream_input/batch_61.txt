0060977493|5|It took me 2 weeks to get thru the first 20 pages of this book.  But don't let that scare you - I just wasn't used to such vivid and powerful language in books.  Once my brain was able to conceptualize the visions Roy was describing, I became hooked on description, and now many other writers just don't satisfy my need for color and light in writing.  Roy's style, because I'm not necessarily so well-read, is fantastically unique and something I recommend to every person who asks for next book project.  Read this book!

0521008433|5|This book provides a useful overview of different approaches to language teaching. It discusses various tested methodologies in considerable detail. Although a theoretical text, it does not contain excessive jargon and concepts should be easy to grasp by the lay reader.
B001UTW7QU|5|I've always been a fan of science fiction and I loved the X-files.  The entire Fringe series has held my interest and admiration since the first episode.  Don't get me wrong, there are times when it was a little hokey and a bit of a stretch but that's just part of the sci-fi experience.  This whole series is well worth your time.  Enjoy!
B0058DRUV6|5|Very unusual and thorough analysis of companies' success story, nicely organized material, well-defined and surprising corollaries.<br />Great amount of thrilling facts about real life companies and personas
B000YDOOUK|4|This album is pretty good, no doubt. However, if you like Airbourne you should be thrilled with Rhino Bucket. Rhino Bucket has been around since 1990 and are without question the next best thing in lieu of AC/DC. In fact, in the early 90's Simon Wright, one of AC/DC's former drummers, joined Rhino Bucket for a short while. So, as I said, if you like AC/DC, [[ASIN:B000M8NMMS Rhino Bucket]] is the next best thing. If you like Ozzy era Black Sabbath, [[ASIN:B00006RST4 Sheavy]] is the next best thing. If you like Dio, [[ASIN:B000ENUYQI Astral Doors]] is the next best thing. If you like Led Zeppelin, [[ASIN:B0001Q5YDQ Kingdom Come]] is probably the next best thing. If you like Vanilla Ice, jamming [[ASIN:B00125NJ64 ice picks]] in your ears is the next best thing, in fact, it's the better thing. Anyway, take a little time and check out the bands I mentioned, I know you'll be glad you did. Also, FYI, instead of buying an Airbourne or Rhino Bucket album you could just wait for AC/DC's new album 'Black Ice' which is scheduled for release in a couple of months. Or hell, just buy 'em all, it's only money, you'll make more!

B000003TA4|5|Nevermind was the album that woke me from my youthful slumber.  One morning, I was getting ready for school and the video for \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was roaring on MTV.  Yep, MTV used to play music videos.  For whatever reason, it took me forever to find the music that reached me and Nirvana was one of the bands that influenced me and guided me toward the music I enjoy most.<br /><br />Why?  Nirvana took the music landscape and carved out its own share of the horizon by embracing styles from a variety of other bands even going so far as releasing covers of their most beloved songs on their box set, With The Lights Out.  Through their intense study of music, Nirvana forged fantastic music that defined a whole new generation of musical style.
0966638328|5|The Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color presents a foundation of basic color theory and then moves on to explain how individual colors, and their combinations, can evoke different responeses from the viewer.  There are many photos to serve as examples so that you see the effects for yourself.  The book does an excellent job of giving enough information to be useful without bogging the reader down with a lot of dry academic theory that would be of little practical use.  In addition, there are Pantone color codes given for all of the specific color combinations shown for ease of use if you will be using professional printing services.  <br /> <br />In summary, this is an excellent resource.  It conveys valuable information about colors and how they effect people in a clear and concise way.  I highly recommend it for everyone with an interest in the subject matter.

B00BWJ6JO4|3|As you probably know the story already -- which isn't actually brought too far along in this melodramatic installment -- you can afford to miss it. Fantasy violence aside, also a little too kid-geared.  Martin Freeman does do a mice job in the lead for those looking for that specifically.
0374532990|5|Great experience! Cute book, I recommend it.
1597808210|5|This is author Paolo Bacigalupi's first novel, and its a great start.  I will look forward to future writing, and I understand his new book, &#34;The Water Knife&#34; is just out.  He writes with a unique view, energy, and imagination.  His characters, settings, imaginary (future) world, technology, and conflicts are well developed and make sense.  He sets the stage well, and for the most part, the novel moves along at an exciting pace.  I also like that the author does not feel compelled to stop the narrative to explain the future world (technology, etc.), but lets the reader figure things out through the story line.<br />The novel takes place in Thailand in about the 22nd century.  The background premise is that global warming has caused significant sea-level rise, oil has become scarce and extremely expensive, people have learned to live without much electricity and carbon-based energy consumption, and there has been a worldwide economic and population contraction.  Things are bleak!  In addition, the major world powers are now argi-business corporations who have a strangle-hold on disease and pest-resistant food crops.  The novel is named for one of the main characters, a 'New Person', genetically-engineered Japanese geisha of sorts named Emiko.  She becomes entangled in a struggle for power among government factions in Bangkok.  The book revolves around this struggle and each character's attempt to both survive the struggle and profit from it.<br />My reasons for not giving the book 5 complete stars are first, the last third of the book starts to drag as the fighting for control of Bangkok goes on.  Each main character is followed through the conflict in individual chapters.  Its becomes a bit too long.  Second, the author over-uses his kink-spring technology and wind-up girl's stutter motion references.  Finally, although the ending sets up well for a sequel, its otherwise weak and a bit disappointing (more of a whimper instead of a bang). These are relatively minor complaints in an otherwise entertaining and very, very good novel.  I recommend it!minor complaints in an otherwise entertaining and very, very good novel.  I recommend it!
B006VFLIYK|5|the book was well written and I enjoy this type of story. I have read the following writers: Robert Lodlum, Vance Flynn and Tom Clancy, however they are gone so now I will follow David Baldacci and Lee Childs. By this list of names you can see which type I like.
0062502182|5|This book came to me at a time in my life when I needed it the most.  I've read a million inspiring books, but this one was different. I've always felt in awe of people who spoke of their spiritual journey's, I just didn't get it. After reading this story, I felt as if something very subtle had changed unexpectedly in the one afternoon it took me to read the book. <br /> <br />Anyone who does not \\"get it\\"  or thought the book is overrated isn't ready to hear the message. It will either strike you to the core or it won't.  I do think at some point in every persons life, they will be ready for the message this book gives.  If nothing else, if it changes your outlook on your life for one day, it will be the best day you've had in a long time. Good luck.
0062082353|5|Bought this for my son, he really liked it.
B001V7YWTQ|5|Love, love, love this collection.  I grew up with the 80's catalog of Mr.'s Clapton and Winwood and their fine solo careers.  With a little age and, hopefully, wisdom, I began to appreciate their work together in Blind Faith, as well as their music from other well-documented venues.  This live collection is the pinnacle of their collective musical genius.  I love the selection here - a nice mix from each resume, and I really enjoy the inclusion of the two Hendrix covers:  Little Wing and Voodoo Chile.  A favorite of mine here is Can't Find My Way Home, a searching, haunting song that has grown into one of my favorite classic rock tunes.  Steve Winwood's vocals are as great as ever, and of course, Eric Clapton will always be The Man.  Other favorites in this collection include Had To Cry Today, Forever Man and Split Decision.  This is great stuff and needs to be part of any classic rock collection.

B00C3UUZVE|5|This one is especially fun for our 5 year old.  We have a master gardner in the family, so out boy is quite familiar with gardens.  This gives him a chance to do some gardening in the house!  He took it over to show his great-great-grandad, who is 93 with dementia.  Guess what?  The old fella loved it too!

B000FCKGPC|5|The fourth of the five volumes of George R.R. Martin's epic Game of Thrones has the same strengths and weaknesses that characterize the first three volumes. The main characters-- particularly the women  (Brienne , Cersei, Sansa) are compelling in the challenges they face in a world that is decidedly masculine.<br />Of the three, I thought Brienne was the most is the sympathetic as a Knight who adheres most faithfully to the code of duty and honor despite the handicaps of being a woman and being an unattractive  woman as well.  Found myself cheering for her as she prevailed in combat with foes who underestimated her. Having read the first three volumes , was disappointed but not surprised by the sad fates Martin had in store for the noble Brienne and her innocent squire.  There was also a hint of redemption for a few minor characters who stood by her at the end, despite her misgivings.<br /><br />Cersei is anything but innocent. The volume ends just as she appears to be getting her just deserts when her twin brother, Jaime ( refuses to heed her plea for rescue. Cersei is a delicious character, beautiful, seductive, ruthless, without redeeming virtue, a cynical player of realpolitik (in contrast to the ingenuous  Brienne

B001U9BRNE|5|Here are some of the great pop songs ever written, performed by some of the great artists of our time.  A few by the originators.    If you like great music of all types, except RAP, and heavy metal rock, you will love this concert.    The Blu Ray is recorded great, and I found the uncompressed audio track. Why it's hidden is unknown to me.    I certainly have heard of David Foster, but I had no idea he was at least half responsible for so many great songs.    At 16.99, the biggest bargain I have ever seen.    I won't write a huge long review, that's been covered.  Buy this and enjoy!    Not a bad song or performance in the entire show.
B000PMLFRA|5|I have loved these movies since I was a kid and have wanted to own them since I lost my set years ago but I did not want to spend the big bucks on a blue ray set until I saw this set on sell.  It does not have all kinds of bells and whistles that some people may want in a box set but it is exactly what I wanted at a great price.

6305075492|5|This film, as is understood by anybody who takes even a second to research it, is basically the height of German Expressionism.  It is the base of the psyche, an insanity so removed one begins to wonder if the movie is about insanity or if the makers were just insane.<br /><br />A man tells his friend about the story of Dr. Caligari, a demented stranger who enters his town during a carnival with a somnambulist who can divinate the future.  The story traces a murder mystery that treads down contemporarily familiar paths, but the sheer audacity of the sets, costuming, music, and acting makes every moment unpredictable and confusing.<br /><br />The only problem with this German silent great is that a few of the absolutely astounding sets are obviously stages.  Otherwise this movie is perfect.<br /><br />And creepy.  Boy is it creepy.  The characters don't even look real in their shapes and contortions sometimes, more like ventriloquist dummies or marionettes, though who would ever make such marionettes would probably need to be hospitalized.  The music itself is so creepy it could honestly stand alone without the image and some wouldn't even tell the difference.  Actually, it's mostly through the music that we're able to even comprehend what's going on, such is the twisted reality of the world we see.<br /><br />This movie is right on the edge, and it seems any more added to it would have made it topple over.  It's its own fine line between the abyss and security.  A must for fans of the absyrd.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B00C5ZORES|5|This is my first Fall Out Boy CD; I purchased it because I fell in love with &#34;My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark.&#34; Since then I've fallen in love with pretty much every other song on this album, so if you like one song, I would say you should get the whole CD - it's completely worth it!
B005HV6Y5W|5|Viewers either greatly admire this Terrence Malick masterpiece or hate it. One thing is for sure and that is that this film needs to be seen more then once. There is no way with a single viewing that one can even begin to appreciate what Malick has achieved with this masterful work. There is very little dialog in the film, but every word is important in understanding the spiritual nature of the film. The Blu-ray disc is state-of-the-art in both picture and sound. I have now ordered four copies of this title and intend to share it with others.
B0055SWM08|5|Sort of reminds me of the cube game called Rush. Really cool. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone.
B000B8QEZG|5|I don't get why some people have a nerve to give this album one star and bash it cruelly. COADF is a brilliant piece of work by Madonna. From the start onto the end, you will be pleased and entertained to the extreme. My utter faves are Hung Up, Get Togther, Sorry, Future Lovers, Let It Will Be, Forbidden Love, Jump, and Like it Or Not. Congratulations Madonna for another musical achievement.

B00000K31V|5|Not only is David Croneneberg's \\"eXistenZ\\" another brilliant film that he wrote and directed but also my current favorite.  It is an engaging story of a couple who are thrown together to play the game \\"eXistenZ\\" that was created by the girl played by Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Jude Law plays opposite her.  It was my first exposure to him as an actor and I was quite impressed.  Cronenberg's story has a lot of similarities to other of his films like \\"Videodrome\\" but has a bit of a sense of a \\"road\\" picture, the couple on the run involved in intrique and some charming yet gross involvements thereby.  I might have enjoyed most of Cronenberg's work, but this picture had the added potential it could have hit a popular nerve.  Kudos to the entire Cronenberg crew.
B00004XPPC|5|Classic and excellent,  being a river person first before ocean, forest, mountains or desert;  I often watch this movie I got at Amazon to re-live the actual river (movie filmed in Sri Lanka) and pretend that I am on the rocks with the cast.  Everything about this movie is enjoyable.  Definitely a mans movie.
B00GSPFD08|5|Loved it. My kid definitely love Lego and this is just perfect. Depends on your kid's age, you might need to  accompany your kid to help to build it but its certainly fun. Once build, you can always rebuild it again and combine some parts from other lego's box. That's what I like from Lego. Its up to  your imagination to build things.
0143116177|5|I'd recommend this book to anyone who could benefit from learning about money and the financial system, which in today's world should be nearly everyone.     If you have a background in finance or economics this will be a valuable book. Indeed while reading the numerous descriptions of past financial crisis I couldn't help but wonder if an earlier publication date could have done anything to lessen the latest one. Probably not. But still, if I was calling the shots at a bank or hedge fund I might make this required reading.    The \\"layman\\" has just as much to gain. Today's financial system has become so complex that I think we often become confused about what money really is. Hunter-gatherers with sea-shell currencies probably understand money better than we do. More than giving a history, Ferguson gives a definition of banking, bonds, equities, insurance, housing markets and global trade by detailing their roots. In the process he answers the question \\"what is money?\\"     It's not the most riveting book on my shelf, but Ferguson does a good job with a subject that can be devastatingly dull in the wrong hands. Stick with it if it comes slowly at first. I found that each chapter was better than the one before and by the end I was enjoying as much as I was learning. I was particularly impressed with the portions of the last chapter where he compares the world on the eve of the first world war, \\"the first age of globalization\\", with the globalizing world of today.

B00CRWJ7VC|4|I admit that I never read the book. I loved the idea of this movie.  I just felt like at the end of the day.  It left me still wondering.. ok so what's life's purpose according to this movie?  I get the sub-plots, but at the end of the day, what is acheived with our connections and the choices we make?  We don't seem to really move any further towards a goal.  -I guess I want a goal, and end game.  Maybe there isn't one..  -But I did like the movie.  -I think it would have been helpful, if they made it more obvious who played who every reincarnation.  The makeup was so good, it was sometimes impossible to tell.  -End of the day, I would watch it again.  It is very thought provoking.

B00J2PFPVI|2|I was excited to see this movie because it had gotten great reviews by movie watchers concerned with the proliferation of princess movies where the point of the movie is for the female character to be saved by a handsome prince with she falls in love and lives happily ever after. In Frozen the female lead does the ultimate rescuing and the primary love story is between sisters. I thought this movie would be a refreshing change from the tyranny of the damsel in distress princess movies. While the primary love story is between sisters the love story that occupies much of the screen time is not. The female lead is repeatedly rescued by male characters (human or snowman) and the entire story is motivated by a young woman's insecurity and resulting hysteria. It's nice that the sisters are powerful characters in their own rights and that heterosexual romantic love does not outright save the day but few of the other familiar tropes of women in the movies are over turned. I had higher hopes.
6304493681|3|I don't know, Japanese culture is so radically different from Western, that's probably the reason Ghost in the Shell never did it for me.  It's not a bad movie, in fact it's good, well, that is until the ending which  absolutely ruins the whole she-bang (no pun intended).<br />The animation is  gorgeous, the plot and characters are well placed, but the damned ending is  so cheesy it makes me want to wretch.  I guess if you can bypass the ending  (I've custom edited my VHS version) then this is quite a good flick, just  don't expect a really cool ending (but hell, what movies these days come  out with a non-cheesball ending).  Face/Off anyone?  Ugh, another good  movie gone to waste by it's laughable ending.  Anyways, my two cents :P

B004TJ1H3C|1|The idiots cancelled Stargate Atlantis for this cheap, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly filmed rip-off of Battlestar Galactica. Okay, Atlantis wasn't great, I even hated it at first, but I got around to watching it, and it was 10 times better than this shaky-cam soap opera which stole the brand name of 'Stargate.' It has nothing to do with either series which came before it, nor the movie. It is full of utter stupidity, and they wasted time, talent and money making this crap. I hope to god this isn't the end of Stargate, but thank god it is the end of Stargate SGU.  I've never been more pissed off about a sci-fi franchise in my life, this idiotic mess was doomed from the beginning, and the appearance of Jackon, RDA, and Carter are nothing short of disturbing and bizarre...as if they'd re-written their characters in order to stick them in this crapfest.     Lost was better than this idiocy.

B000SEGUDE|1|This book was painful to read. The author seems more intent on displaying his MFA background with pretentious words than telling the story. I kept reading but halfway through I had still not gotten to the &#34;good&#34; part. I skipped ahead a hundred pages and finished it. From what I can tell I didn't miss anything.

0393035158|5|Courageous to write in this current atmosphere with rise of social conservatives based on \\"American Christian Values\\". If you are a Christian or Muslim. You will find this book difficult to stomach.  <br /> <br />    In your face writing. Very direct and Blunt \\"Theology is an extension of human Ignorance\\", articulate and easy to read. States his position clearly and argues his point well. This is an attack on Monotheistic Religions - primarily Judeo-Christian religions (Islam, Judaism and Christianity) throughout the world. He makes a compelling case that we cannot grow into a more civilized society unless we shed our primitive and illogical believe systems.  <br /> <br />     Highly recommended reading. I thought his analysis of our illogical religious views and related actions were right on, although I did not agree completely with him on all his points, it stimulated me to think and rethink some of my positions. If you have strong liberal or conservative views, your position will be challenged. He is an independent thinker and he is not going to feed you what you want to hear. This is what a good book should do. Important and relevant book and we need more books like this. Thus the five stars. <br /> <br />    Loaded with memorable quotes. I found myself re-reading sections and sentences and then close the book and stare in space as I comprehend a new idea.  <br /> <br />   Some of the criticism here in Amazon review is fair. He does come across as an \\"atheist fundamentalist\\" as one reviewer wrote. Sam Harris rightly criticizes needless wars in the name of promoting religion, but he seems to promote wars in the name of fighting religion. I find this a bit hypocritical. I am not sure he is any better than the religious zealots he criticizes.  <br /> <br />  Where I take exception and I feel his argument is the weakest, is his that He is too forgiving on the nature of \\"intent\\" and war itself as being justified to fight ignorance. In his view, we (the US) at war aremore humane than Islam at war because of our \\"intent\\". We do not intend to kill innocents (they are collateral), where as Islamic people at war do. I think this is a narrow definition of intent and too forgiving. War by its nature is inhumane regardless of intent. And whether your loved one was killed intentionally or not, it doesn't make it any easier to accept or any more justifiable or make you more rightous. In addition, collateral damage is acceptable as long as it is the other side that is experiencing it. If for example, the Iraqi resistance was able to reach our shores and retaliate, and caused collateral damage of US citizens, then our view of the war and our interest in ending it sooner will rise. So what is the morality of the war? Also, if collateral damage is more humane than targeting civilians intentionally, then no civilian deaths is more humane than collateral damage. We should be rising to the occasion (or evolving) where wars are no longer legitimate.  When the US is able to keep its citizenry detached from the reality of the war, it causes prolonged suffering of the other side.  Also Harris does not address \\"cause and effect\\" and \\"ends justify the means\\" foreign policy. Don't we need to be held accountable for our actions? But the US has more at its disposal than military. It is the intent of the US to use its economic might to keep nations in poverty. He does not address this...Recommended reading \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" <br /> <br />    He leaves the impression that he only reason Islamic terrorists are attacking us is for religious reasons only and they are  stuck in the 14th century beyond any sense of reasoning. The Koran is rooted in violence and justifies them attacking us - The infidels. As a result, the only remedy is to wage a war (with justifiable collateral damage) against Islam.  I think he goes too far here. The Koran explains their hideous actions, but not their real motives. I think he underestimates there is a realwar against the west based on what we do, not what we believe. After all, there are no terrorist attacks in South America, Canada, Japan, Eastern Europe or Australia. Yet they are all Infidels. The US and Western Europe have a long history in the Middle East of occupation, puppet governments, support for Israel, military intervention and oil interests that cannot be discounted as the reason. Now the war in Iraq has given the terrorist more reason to hate us. He gives the impression that the war on terror can only be won militarily through war. I agree the military has a role to play, but it is not enough. He does not adequately address other factors in combination with the military action; cultural change in the Middle East and a change in US foreign policy. Recommended Reading; Imperial Hubris Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror.  <br /> <br />     In place of religion, Harris proposes a Buddhist view of life. He does not go into detail on Buddhism but touches briefly on some of its tenets with regard to reason, logic, our thoughts and consciousness. For the intellectually curious, he may inspire you to learn more about this relatively unknown religion.  <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00DDZM0GQ|5|I don't write reviews often, but was compelled to write one for this game. Not a Tetris ripoff, but in the same vane. Very good graphics. Smooth game play. Addictive. Could use access to sound options from pause menu, but that's about the only bad thing I could even think of. And no intrusive permissions either. Bravo to the dev.
B000FBFN1U|5|Game of thrones... need I say more?
0525423842|4|I loved the book, and I think my students will also. Those reviewers who think that the school setting is outdated must not have their children in a good private school. Although the school where I teach does not segregate the sexes, teachers and staff all have a personal interest in each and every student. I doubt that many of the students think their classes are boring at my school, but they are each respectful of the students and challenge each student to excellence. Thank you, John Grisham, for portraying a school where people actually learn and care about each other.
B004JN1CW4|5|Very good story. Well told and interesting through and through. Fast paced and easy to stay with. A real page turner.
1401907717|5|Ever since I purchased \\"Daily Guidance From Your Angels\\" I have used it with clients, students, friends and myself.  When I give a client a private Reading, before we conclude I ask The Angelic Realm what final message does the client need and then open the book.  The Angelic Message is ALWAYS appropriate and timely.  Of course, I also use the book, especially before I begin my day.  I ask \\"What do I need to know right now?\\" Then, I open the book.  It never fails; the message is exactly what I need. <br /> <br />I think there is also a softcover version of the book, but I find the hardcover edition more elegant and beautiful.  In addition, the beautiful royal purple ribbon marker is excellent for keeping one's place. <br /> <br />I have purchased several of Dr. Doreen Virtue's books, but this one is definitely one of my favorites.  I cannot over recommend it.
B0000A1RJI|5|I've seen Pirates 6 times, and the last 2 were just to hear the music and place it with the movie scenes. The score for this movie is unbelievable. Badelt does an amazing job of making it piratey, adventureous, sweeping, and dramatic all at the same time, and in a few of the tracks particularly #5, kinda creepy. But that's all part of the magic. I think the reason this movie has been so successful is because of it's ability to transport people to the Caribbean and pulls them into the world of Captain Jack Sparrow, and this score does the same thing. Normally I am not a score type person, for instance the great Lord of the Rings soundtrack held my interest for one listen. Not so with this. I listen to it every day and everytime I hear it, I get an irresistable urge to see the movie again. Definitely 5 stars.
B00UHQ73NO|3|Muse to me is one of the most exciting and energetic and fresh sounding bands walkin about-  always look forward to what Mathew and co have created.  I think this album may have missed the mark slightly- overly trying to duplicate success- deAD INSIDE seems like a Madness sequel  and Mercy  a Follow Me sequel-  Psycho  is interesting hard but too bland after initial grabbing you. Repetitive,  however  Reaper  and Revolt very excellent and fresh and a few others carry for a decent release- Wondering if personal strife and burn out have caused a slight dry up of new material?  If one looks back on the previous few cds they are simply powerhouses-  heres for the future of Muse-
B004SB60OC|5|I first heard Christina Perri when she opened for James Blunt on his recent tour. I made a note to look for the CD because she was better than many opening acts I've seen.    At first glance, it's \\"oh, another one of those\\" -- that is, a female singer-songwriter no doubt trying to glamorize urban single womanhood by making it sound forlorn and depressing, where you're supposed to find more in the lyrics than in the music.    But it's not like that. The lyrics try to tell truth while being delivered in an uplifting way, and the music is (dare I say) quite inventive. It's not your run-of-the-mill delivery from a twentysomething female singer-songwriter.    In this regard, she is the female equivalent of Matt Nathanson or Royal Wood -- you think you know what you're about to get by looking at them, but actually get something many levels higher.    Each track has its own personality, and the music is varied enough within each track to hold your interest; the album flows well and feels whole; there is no apparent filler, and the album doesn't outstay its welcome length-wise.    What more can you ask for these days? Definitely worth a listen.
B007EECSFA|5|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  It kept my interest and had a surprising ending.
B00BD99JMW|4|This is not going to be a typical review. I don't think I can do that without spoiling the book way too much. I have bookish friends to do that with! Still, like many other readers I devoured the book on release day. I've seen a variety of different reactions and thought I'd add mine. I won't be giving away plot points but I will certainly be talking about how it made me feel. If you don't want to know anything at all you should probably stop reading right now. Also, don't go to any blog posts about the book. Actually, you should probably just get off the internet because it is littered with major spoilers!!! :)<br /><br />So, day two post finishing Allegiant... and I'm still all wrapped up about it. First and foremost, I think it's amazing. Veronica Roth can sure tell a story. I admire her and the choices she made in writing the story as she did. And I think it's just... right. I can't think of any other word to use.<br /><br />That doesn't mean I wasn't sitting slack-jawed at parts or that my heart didn't break at others. Sure, there are things I wish didn't have to happen. But I don't wish it because they are &#34;wrong&#34; or ruin the story or because I think Veronica Roth &#34;owed&#34; me or anything like that. I wish it because they are hard and sad and I wish they weren't so true to what would likely happen. I wish everyone, everywhere got a happily ever after. I wish a broken world could easily be healed. I wish many, many, things. But as John Green writes in The Fault in our Stars, &#34;The world is not a wish-granting factory.&#34; So, yes, things happened that shocked and upset me. But they certainly didn't ruin the book. Rather, I think they make the series stronger. And, while I may not re-read the third book over and over again, I am glad I ordered it in all it's forms.<br /><br />Allegiant was an emotional end to a much loved series. No matter what happened there were going to be tears. While I was not prepared for the volume of them, I do not regret or resent a single thing. Well done Ms. Roth, well done.t or resent a single thing. Well done Ms. Roth, well done.
B00BAXFECK|4|Very long book but hard to put down.
B003O86FMW|5|Astonishing Speechless There are no words to describe how amazing this book is... I highly recommend it to all ages above 9
B0052RDHTM|5|A great historical fiction.....,couldn't out it down!!
B001CEE1YE|4|Love this series of movies. And now to have it on blu-ray is even better. The best would be to have it in 3D. Then it would get a five-star rating.
B00CATONCA|5|Alot better than i expected! It was a girlf for my boyfriend and he loves it so much that he brags about it to everyone!!
B00JGMK6VG|5|Best CBM ever!
B00133KHCY|5|Great Movie!!!!  Awesome Price!!!!  Very happy customer. Will definatley purchase again.<br />Product received very promptly. First class service!!! Thanks :-)
0132350882|5|This book is 'the' book for serious software writers. Do you think that you understand object oriented programming? Read this and tell me again. Do you think starting TDD is difficult? Read this book and you have done half of the basic work required for TDD. Do you think that you write beautiful/elegant code? Read this book and tell me how you define elegance now.<br /><br />This book is not for the 'just want to get over it' type of software developers. If you are serious about your work and you want to keep your colleagues, your business (eventually) and your product in good shape, this book is for you. I am glad that i read this book and even more glad that i convinced a lot of other people to read it. It is worth every penny and every minute spent.
B00F87ZUYG|5|My family and I were glued to the couch with TV trays every Sunday at 7! Bring on Season 5!
B00GUOEMA4|5|Real life narrative, exiting and inspiring , not only for managers of so called creative entrerprises, but useful for &#34;ordinary&#34; folk. Only not to be used as a recipe in each detail. Be inspired!
B0054JZC6E|3|i like this game, but it gets a little boring after a while.....because you dont have enough coins to unlock a new game....otherwise it is pretty good.
B00GMFYX0A|4|Good
B0050QV0RQ|4|this game is awesome my only problem is that there is no guide or help. I have no idea what earning tp does or what the point of tablets is. this is my first jrpg so I haven't played a game like this before.
B00COMLLX2|5|Great graphics and a lot of fun.  Love it on the go when I'm not playing pinball fx on my Xbox 360.
B004DK5CW4|5|Great DVD of one of the most favorite racing horses ever ~ even more special since he was raised in my home state of VA, not to far from where we live!!!
B00BIPCY14|4|good show..good acting...gets progressively better throughout season
B00942X8PY|5|This is a very imaginative game that can open up your thought processes, creatitivity, and problem-solving abilities. The name itself is ingenious. I got it as the FAOTD so it was a no-brainer to get it. I think I've done about 70 levels so there is a LONG way to go. If I get stuck on a particular game (I've tried both modes -- the Zen comments are pretty funny, though a bit repetitious), I just look for another one; no reason to get stressed out. A real nice app for phones and tablets.
B00B7Y0206|5|Its a great app it has a few problems but its constantly getting updated to fix them and its not like  your losing anything cause it free
B00DVKOYBM|5|lots of fun.. have to play every night.. but would like to know the country name.. I don't know all the flags
0671027344|5|My girlfriend told me I should read it, and after her telling me how much she was into it, I asked her to let me borrow it. From beginning to end I couldn't put the book down. Maybe from my perspective as a teenager I could relate with so much of what Charlie was saying. I would recomend this book to anyone growing up right now. The book pulls you in and sort of makes you Charlies best friend. I would recommend this book.
0553103547|5|I can't write as well as Mr. Martin, so I very likely will not do justice to his books in this short review.  If I were speaking to my co-workers I'd merely say, &quot;Man, you are cheating yourself if you don't read the Song of Ice and Fire series.&quot;  And if I were trying to impress a young lady over Friday night cocktails, I'd say, &quot;George R.R. Martin has writtten the finest example of the fantasy genre; an awesome saga entitled A Song of Ice and Fire.&quot;  But, since I'm just writing this for a bunch of folks I'll never meet let me state, plainly: Get thiese books.  Now!  You may never enjoy another novel till he writes the next, but, hey...life's a frigging gamble.
B00128FK40|3|not for me.  not really my style.
B004W2UBYW|5|A well written, engaging biography of a somewhat eccentric, world transforming genius.
B00BUCXVPI|4|Considering that Jack Reacher is 6'5\\" and a blond in all of the books, Tom Cruise did him justice. A very good movie!
B001R0KH3M|3|I was expecting Stevie to play more of his most popular songs but this video had maybe three songs at the most. Not worth the purchase price.
B004JHYRP4|5|Very thought provoking.
B00FAPF5U0|3|Not bad .not. bad at all but can be addicting.
B00AEFXV3E|5|I wanted to explore further into David Lynch's films after having seen Blue Velvet and Lost Highway. The Elephant Man is probably one of the most straight forward films in Lynch's body of work. There are a few short, trippy sequences in this movie, which more closely resemble the stranger side of Lynch, but overall, it's an easy to follow film that depicts a very unique life story. The Elephant Man is an interesting dramatized character story of a severely deformed man who transcends the abusive life of the freak show circuit and gains dignity and acceptance. I won't go into lengthy detail about the plot, but having worked with children with severe disabilities, I enjoyed this film and the way it casts a hopeful light for people who have been historically marginalized/abused. As usual, Anthony Hopkins is excellent and plays a doctor who truly was ahead of his time in acknowledging the humanity in someone who had never been treated as a human. Highly recommended!
B000001ESN|5|What a RUSH!
B00IUBXPEY|5|I was drawn into the books in an intense way and was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie.  Much better than the first movie.
B00VFTA70I|5|Brilliantly acted, though a tragedy at every level - other than having the war finish
B00A86AIAI|5|ArtFX+ Statues are awesome. The are work is very precise.  I have the full DC New 52 collection and I plan to get others as they come available.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I really enjoy playing this game. Many rewards and different rooms and types of ways to search. I wish there was more chances to acquire anomalies to clear pictures without having to use real money to purchase crystals.
B000002LLC|3|First off, this album is definitely worth owning as it is the only place to get the original mix of the smash \\"Vogue\\" (#1 Pop, #23 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance), with the original \\"finger-snap/bongo-drum\\" introduction intact.  The version of \\"Vogue\\" that was included on THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION featured a needlessly extended intro (and also dropped some of the killer synth lines), while the single/radio version of the song skipped the introduction all together.  The version featured here (which is the version that was used in the music video) is the definite mix of the classic Shep Pettibone collaboration, and it is arguably THE quintessential Madonna single.  As of this writing, I'M BREATHLESS is still the only album where \\"Vogue\\" can be found in it's original form.    Besides \\"Vogue,\\" the album's other Madonna-written material (the rest co-written with Pat Leonard) is in the form of a pseudo-concept album, attempting to capture the witty dancehall material of the 1930's, as performed by Madonna as DICK TRACY's club chanteuse Breathless Mahoney.  On this level, Madonna demonstrates surprising versatility as both a songwriter and a singer as she whips up a marvelous torch song in \\"He's a Man,\\" a sentimental-yet-simmering ballad with \\"Something to Remember,\\" and goofily brilliant novelty tunes like \\"Back in Business\\" and the single \\"Hanky Panky\\" (#10 Pop).  Sure, the overall sound feels less like 1930's big band and more like Broadway-pop circa 1990, but that's part of the fun.  Of the six Madonna-penned numbers, only \\"Cry Baby\\" fails to engage, and perhaps should have been dropped from the track selection.     The album also contains two songs by co-written Andy Paley, and, although these tracks are in the same vein as the Madonna/Leonard material on the album, they are surprisingly not as much fun.  The Brazilian-flavored \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" is cute enough for it's brief 90-second runtime, although it's meager success stems more from Madonna's uncanny Carmen Miranda impersonation than from the actual number.  Paley's \\"Now I'm Following You\\" is one of only four songs on the album to have actually been featured in the film DICK TRACY (in a version performed by Paley himself, however, not the version on this album sung by Madonna and Warren Beatty), although it's actually rather pedestrian (though harmless) fluff.  The version of the song included on I'M BREATHLESS is given more mileage by some amusing interplay by Madonna and then-current beau Warren Beatty, as well as some humorous production gimmicks in the \\"Part II\\" remix of the song.        Where Madonna really impresses fans, however, is on the three numbers written by Steven Sondheim, unarguably one of the finest songwriters of his generation (the Sondheim tracks are also incidentally the remaining three of this disc's four tracks that actually appear in the film DICK TRACY).  Madonna's studio rendition of the Oscar-winning vamp classic \\"Sooner or Later\\" is sizzling and touching, although I actually prefer the brassier, Monroe-like live performance of the song that Madonna performed on the 63rd Annual Academy Awards.  Madonna also rises to the challenge in delivering some of Sondheim's trademark rapid-fire wordplay on the terrific \\"More,\\" a delightfully satirical number that successfully puts Madonna in the comedic Judy Holiday territory that she has always professed to aspire to as a performer.  Of the Sondheim material, only \\"What Can You Lose\\" fails to completely connect, largely due to the fact that the song is pitched too high for Madonna's low register, and it ends up becoming solo piece for duet partner Mandy Patinkin (albeit, a very pretty one).     Due to the success of \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Hanky Panky,\\" I'M BREATHLESS shot straight to the #2 position on the Hot 200, and managed to achieve Double-Platinum status in sales.  Madonna, in general, was virtually unstoppable in 1990, and this album is a great snapshot of this milestone year for the entertainer.  With the seemingly-constant airplay of the \\"Vogue\\" video and single, her well-received supporting turn in DICK TRACY, and the mammoth BLONDE AMBITION tour (which is still probably her greatest artistic achievement), this was also one of the few times that Madonna was a darling of the critics.  A very good concept recording that finds the diva stretching outside her usual fare and successfully delivering something different, I'M BREATHLESS is good fun.
B00FVVR2ZO|3|Love the graphics and the story. I don't however like how much energy it takes to investigate scenes the higher experience you have. I also think it takes way to many diamonds to get certain items and how difficult it is to get items the more experience you have. I started playing this game because it was fun. Now it's just frustrating.
B000OQF6N6|5|First of all we should only review the music nothing else is the only interest of making a review of an album the MUSIC...well all i can say what we have here is great music Corgan try to make a very heavy album and he sucededs. The best tracks in my on opinion are the ones produced by Roy Thomas Baker witch have a more melodic felling in them (6,9,12)maybe he should have produced more tracks of the album because these tracks are superb and give something new to the smashing universe besides the heaviness that we find in the album. Lets see if this new smashing beggin is to last but one thing for certain the music in this album is very good and deserve a chance!!The smashing pumpkins legacy is very well preserved here no doubt, i seen future in here!!And to some people that in this moment dont no that seamise album Corgan played all instruments besides the drums the same in Meloncoly beside the fact that all music was written by Corgan so i dont seen how people think that James iha and darcy are missed here when in the first place they didnt writte almost any smashing songs!! Billy Corgan was and is the smashing pumpkins and we all know that!
B002C4PWD2|4|Good
B0009A1AS2|5|I've always loved Dream Theater's music, but have frequently found that they never quite acheived their potential as a band . . until now. <br /> <br />In the early days, they had good songs, but they were buried under arrangements that showed off each member's technical skill at the expense of the songs themselves.  But they improved.  In 1994, they finally released an album where the themes of one song would be revisited in another song, and the cd as a whole had a conceptual arc.  And they continued to improve.  In 1997, the band finally released an album which was all about the songwriting and creativity, not the showoff virtuoso instrumentalism. Unfortunately there was nothing connecting the songs.  It was just a collection of songs with no arc, and nothing really connecting them.  1999s Scenes From a Memory gave us a sequel to the prog-anthem Metropolis off their 1992 Images and Words album, but also found the band getting more and more bogged down in their attempts to show off how complicated their time-signature changes could be (ever heard of 19/16).  And this trend continued right up to the nearly unlistenable noisefest they released in 2003, Train of Thought. <br /> <br />But now they've shifted gears and given us an album which is all about composition, songwriting, creativity, and beauty.  Yes, there are still impressive virtuoso bits, but they serve the songs, as opposed to the songs serving as vehicles to show off the virtuoso runs.  And it makes for the best album of Dream Theater's career. <br /> <br />The opening track is part 3 of a trilogy of songs which began in 2002 with \\"The Glass Prison\\" and continued with \\"This Dying Soul\\" (the latter of which has its chorus reprised in this new song).  It's a powerful opening to a great album.  The second track finds the band charting new territory with a piano-driven song that you'll be wanting to sing along with from the very first time you hear it.  There's also an honest-to-goodness popmetal song on here called I Walk Beside You (something I never thought DT would ever do).  All of this culminates in the half-hour masterwork that is the title track.  Here, we get reprises of several themes from the album, along with a reprise of the melody to Voices from their Awake album, and a fully symphonic bombastic ending that'll have you requeing the thing to track one the moment it's over. <br /> <br />So yes, I'd call it Dream Theater's best work ever.  And considering that two years ago, I was ready to write them off, that's saying something.
B0069GRIHW|5|This is the expanded with outtakes of the la sessions i like this i wish that jim stayed around to play them on stage.
B00DJFIMW6|4|The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is that the responses, that is, when I swipe to go left, right, up or down, and it isnt recognized, and I lose a life, is very annoying. I also dont like having to pay for coins. (I have not paid real money for them!) You should be able to earn coins. Otherwise, fun and addicting!
B001BKVWYG|5|If you've never hear Rodriguez this is the album to start with.  It's the one that was big in So. Africa for so many years.
B00P7PJ9P0|4|It was surprisingly good, I liked the twist
B004T4KQJS|5|Here is a book for those who have an interest in exploring the wonders of the universe and the elements that comprise it.  It is not an easy read but it is a fascinating one to say the least.  Those who have a background in physics, and especially astrophysics, will have a leg up in grasping the explanations which Prof. Krauss presents in this book.  Personally, I have neither but still enjoyed the book and found it extremely interesting and educational.  He does not have much regard for those who are critical of his perspective based on the existence of a Supreme Being or Prime Mover.  God is a creation of the human mind and is left for the field of theology, not science.  If you have strong feelings about the existence of God, you will not appreciate this book.  For others, I think you will enjoy the trip.  I intend to re-read it in order to better grasp what Prof. Krauss discusses.
B007J4T2G8|5|highly entertaining if you can get past the initial premise of BDSM the growing love/desire and the word bi-play between the two main characters is wonderfully comic relief!!
B00846REIS|1|I bought this based on the review that if you liked 50 Shades of Gray that you would love this book. NOT! Several times I caught myself thinking \\"is this plagiarism?\\" Don't get me wrong, the writing was better, but the storyline was almost exactly the same.  I felt like I was watching a rerun on tv.  I will not be buying the second novel.
140120306X|5|I adore the first two volumes of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and this one did not disappoint.     Yes, it is very different than the first two volumes - since most of the story here seems to only set up parts of the Black Dossier 'additional reading' included inside, BUT I found the whole thing an amazing piece of literature.    I'll confess that I did not get a lot of the references, but if you've been reading the other League books than you should be use to obscure literary references by now, that's part of the charm and the idea of the story (how many people today even know who Alann Quartermain is?).     I've never seen the hated movie adaptation of the first comic, nor do I plan to - and if you're a fan of the movie and have never read the comics, I would not start here. This is also very much an adult comic - lots of adult situations, so don't get this for the little ones (but these comics aren't meant for kids anyway).
B00I3ULQQ6|3|Looks good. The hard plastic makes it more slippery in your hand.
B00B5HQKNI|4|I have seen several Bond movies and they all are pretty good. This one was also pretty good. What can I say? Check it out!
031606792X|4|I am a huge fan of the whole Twilight Series. Admittedly, I did not love Bella's pregnancy. I felt like I really lost the essence of the characters. However, it had a great beginning and a great ending. I will still read it again and still love Bella and Edward!
B009PMB3CI|5|I loaded this app for my granddaughter she Loves it.  However I also enjoy playing with it .  It builds motivational skills and a good educational tool.
B00E1L9N8E|5|Acting, sets, costumes, music excellent in this adaption. The party scenes tops in movie making history. Go see it today!
B00BD99JMW|4|Allegiant isn't on my list of favorite young adult books, but it does wrap up the series well. I was not a fan of the point of view switching between Tris and Tobias. It felt disjointed to me and didn't allow me to get into the story as well as the first two. I also found the world of factions intriguing so I was disappointed the last book took place outside the faction society. However, I think Roth concluded the series well- se wrapped up the story well without leaving tons of loose ends. In that way, I was a satisfied reader. Overall, the Divergent series is worth reading through the finish. It's a fun, action packed series that makes you think.
B008IJTFYW|5|So awesome to be able to create my own sound combinations. I make up a different  one almost every night.
B009NQZVKG|5|Excellent use of facts to get a story that keeps you engrossed at every step of its telling. The characters are entwined smoothly in the plot and each other to make a very real possibility of doing things a team needs to persevere. The timing may have been closer than reality for the end but it didn't detract from a good story. Recommended.

B00BAXFJ5M|5|A good read!  Baldacci's characters are fully developed with multi-dimensional characteristics that make them very like able.
B00GINENG0|5|I like it much better than the original Talking Tom.  Quick bit of entertainment perfect over morning coffee and bagel.
B0071XO8RA|5|I bought this book because I was looking for something interesting and man did I get what I wanted. Its a very interesting story and very mysterious (which is good). I found myself whispering &#34;dont do it&#34; or &#34;no no no no&#34; while reading. It does have a slightly dark plot with it being set under ground and all in a silo but nothing to steer anyone away!
B00C5R8364|5|I love Frederick Forsyth's novels going all the way back to the perfection of The Day of The Jackal. Unlike a lot of &#34;name&#34; authors, each subsequent work has been more enthralling than the one before. The Kill List continues his foray into the contemporary issues of terrorism and if you like Forsyth, you'll love this book

6301224612|4|The video is great and shows Bruce and the E Street Band in their gold  days, but I'm not agree with all its content. I think it would be less  videoclips and more live performances, specially of Darkness, the River and  Born in the USA tours. Also there are many singles that aren't the best  Bruce's songs (Glory days, I'm on fire, ...). Despite it, you should buy it  if you're a great fan of the Boss.

0439023513|1|I'm writing this review for a book that was listed a YA.  This book seemed less YA but I would have been more disappointed had it been an adult book.  ************spoilers*************  I loved the first two books.  Katniss was an interesting character that had depth and used her mind to figure things out to survive. In the third book she becomes a shell that drifts through the book.  Most of the book she is either drugged, injured or despondent.  Many of the other characters are flat.  The whole \\"special squad\\" she joins screams \\"red shirted ensigns\\" from star trek lore.  I liked the authors style in the first two books.  This time from the siege of the Capitol on, it seems choppy and rushed.  The plot seems less thought out.  A few examples:  1.  If Coin wanted Katniss dead, why didn't they let her die at the end of the book?  The medics blew up so the odds of her surviving serious injury seem a stretch anyway.  2.  Prim's death made no sense.  Young medics that close to the fighting?  It would have made more sense if it had been her mom as a squad medic.  3.  Snow was a ruthless, conniving leader.  That lame attempt at a human shield was the best he could do?  He razed district 12, why not launch a nuke or two?  Putting the kids outside is just a easy way to get Gale's trap sprung.  The trap was better suited for district 2 anyway.  There are many others, especially based around the lame throwaway group that Katriss gets to sneak through the city and yet somehow gets there slower than the main army.  I wasn't hoping for a happy ending but simply one that was in character with Katniss and her journey in the first two books.  The ending seemed contrived and very un\\"young adult.\\"  If the author truly wanted a bleak ending, she should have had Katniss travel quickly, one chapter, with the main army.  Then once they get to the mansion, Coin who wants rid of Katniss, sends her group to kill Snow.  Katniss knocks out Peeta to save him.  On the assualt of the mansion, everyone dies but Katniss.  Katniss reaches Snow but he has killed himself, like Hitler.  Giving Katniss no resolution and a hollow \\"what was the point feeling\\".  Throw in some poison roses surrounding Snow, and Katniss still gets injuries she must always suffer through.  That would leave enough book to learn about how the Republic shakes out and see the aftermath.  It would also allow to find out how Peeta and Katniss work things out.  Or maybe show a better resolution with Katniss and Gale.  I rated book 1 a 4 and book 2 a 5 so I'll rate the series a 3.  It could have a been a thought provoking classic series.

B0000636UN|5|This latest offering from Sheryl Crow is a timely<BR>reminder of what real musicianship is (or used to<BR>be!) about--interesting lyrics, great hooks, sublime<BR>singing and playing, and a feeling that the artist<BR>is actually trying to communicate something personal<BR>to the listener.  How often do you find that in pop<BR>music these days?  You may quibble that there's no<BR>great change in style or sound from her previous<BR>efforts, and I would've put on a few more uptempo<BR>rockers, but you can't argue with this woman's<BR>talent.  She's the real deal!
B00Z4YWX66|5|Wow, this book is amazing. This isn't the first time I ended up staying up all night reading something from Rebecca Hamilton, and I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. At first, I had no idea what this book was about(nope, didn't bother to read the blurb), and I'm glad I didn't because everything took me by surprise. I loved the world I was pulled into, and I loved the writing, the voice, and the characters. And Abram . . . wow, is he hot. Actually both Char and Abram are hot. Filled with suspense, magic, and sexiness, you are not going to want to pass this one up!
B005LAII80|5|Sweet Lord! This movie is amazing.  I want them to put out a sequel with Karl Urban and everything.  This was the perfect movie to watch when I was feeling down/angry at the world.  Karl Urban's Dredd is perfect - just erases the crazy image that was Sly Stallone's Dredd.  Which I thank you for, Karl Urban.  I have already convinced ten other friends to watch it since buying it last month.  So good!
B00004U45G|4|I first heard this album broadcast on the radio and immediately knew that I had to buy it. The Black Crowes haven't sounded this good since &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot; although their latest,  &quot;By Your Side,&quot; came close. <br />At lot of this most certainly has  to do with Jimmy Page, whose playing sounds fresh and highly energized. You  can tell these musicians fed off the energy of each other, and it's  beautifully captured in this &quot;best-of&quot; live show culled from two  nights on October 18 &amp; 19, 1999 at the Greek Theater in L.A. <br />I would  disagree with the standard reviewer's comments about which songs are best  and say that, for my money, the best tunes are the reworkings of the  Zeppelin covers, most of which have only seen release on bootleg in their  live format. In my opinion, the best songs are: Custard Pie, Heartbreaker,  Out On The Tiles/Whole Lotta Love, and In My Time Of Dying, although all  the rest are better than most of the garbage being released today.<br />If you  are a Crowes fan OR a Zeppelin fan OR just want to hear a great live album  that you can crank up in the car for those long road trips, this is  it.<br />My one gripe is the extra track, &quot;Mellow Down Easy,&quot; that's  been added to the retail release.  For those of us that bought it as an  internet exclusive from Musicmaker.com, we're getting the shaft on this one  ... and for that I only give it four stars. C'mon guys, why punish your  truest fans by adding another track now? How about a reasonably priced  bonus CD single available only to those fans who originally bought the  album online with &quot;Mellow Down Easy&quot; plus a couple of alternate  live tracks from the shows?  Are you listening Chris Robinson?

B00168HARG|5|This show ignores all of the Terminator movies after Judgment Day. It does rely heavily on the time travel theme, with one jump to the future and several jumps from the future. However, the show is still interesting, showing Sarah preparing for Judgment Day, and Skynet preparing as well.  It's never said what model Terminator Cameron is, however, from what I've heard, she's a T-808.
034580404X|5|If you can make it through the first book, the rest are better. The story gets better as the characters are developed. The books are a quick, fun read. They are silly, romantic, not everyones cup of tea but I enjoyed them.
B00EY8BRGU|2|Not a fan of movies where the characters are so annoying and unlikeable that  no amount of special effects can make it a hood movie. Blah.

B00008J4P5|5|I first heard of The White Stripes when I saw that they were nominated for some Grammys.  After watching the Grammys this year, I sort of caught on to their performance of &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;.  It has a good beat and is fun to listen to.<br />So I decided to buy their album.  I was a little hesitant, because I normally do not listen to this kind of music (Indie Rock, etc.).  BUT I have to say that I'm glad I bought the CD.  The music is exciting and full of energy.  They are a great classic rock band.  I mean, their style is classic.  They sound like they are from the 60's.  I really enjoy the CD.  If you liked &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;,  you will like the CD.
B00BHUB11Y|5|My granddaughter and I love this movie. She is 2 and asks to watch &#34;Monsters&#34;. It is full of humor.
1416511946|4|Very interesting read.  Essentially a year in the life of Nikki Sixx through his own lens in &#34;real-time&#34;, as well as the views of those around him at the same time.  Layered upon that are present-day reflections of Nikki and many of the same individuals, describing now what it was like back then relative to the specific stories and events.<br /><br />It's an amazing story about what we, the public, don't know or see - the life of a rock star at the very top of the world was at the same time as low as it could possibly be for him.  Not a pity story or a sympathy grab, just a very interesting, very matter of fact view of life as it was for this particular rock star.

B001E7OO2I|5|I'm not understanding the reasoning behind the STRONG dislikes against this album at all... maybe because this album is soooo different from his previous ones. Well, in my opinion, the album summed up in one word: EPIC. I loved his 1st, was kinda feelin the 2nd, and ended up being a bit scared about the turnout of this album... WELL, it turned out just fine ! This is really what his second album should've been. It DEFINITELY has a different vibe so BEWARE and it doesn't include many of the monumental emphasized \\"ballad-singing\\" Legend usually does but IF you can get over that, the album is pretty damn good. The topics brought up on EVOLVER still have the strong roots of Legend's creativity. The Feel Good tracks include his joints with Kanye West, Estelle, & Brandy and also his solo joints \\"Everybody Knows,\\" \\"Good Morning,\\" & \\"I Love, You Love.\\" The only track that sounds bad is Track 8: \\"This Time\\" and one of the extra bonus tracks \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love).\\" Other than that, this album is FIYA--- respect J.L. for what he still knows how to do & that's making goood music !    PEACE.
0920668372|5|Great book.
B001EC3JME|3|this says it fits all sizes and i originally got it for a triple c battery flashlight;<br />but that light was too big;<br />i use it now for my small maglite and that works very well, better than the maglight holster that comes with the flashlight since this holder grabs the light, so the light doesn't fall out as easily
B00008J4P5|5|While I particularly didn't care much for White Blood Cells (mainly because I had just heard of the White Stripes), Elephant really grew on me during the third listen.  That said, the album doesn't make a significant impact when just breezed through to check for the subject matter and &quot;feel&quot;.  It honestly takes patience to &quot;get into&quot; the album.<br />You can only understand just how intelligent, excellent, and infectious this album is after a few listens.  &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; is ferociously indie, while &quot;There's No Home For You Here, Girl&quot; is very much Queen-ish, but in the same respect very sarcastic and stylish.  &quot;In The Cold, Cold Night&quot; is off-putting due to Meg's vocals, but you'll suddenly find yourself singing along come after you've understood and learned the lyrics.  The rest of the album contains stand-out tracks which you'll soon find irresistable, and thus the feel of it as a whole is very &quot;Southern&quot; and &quot;homey&quot;, making you feel the need to make a call to your mother.<br />The White Stripes deserve five stars for just being as coy about this album as they were creative and intelligent in the complete delivery.  It was not at all a rush job, but rather effectively planned without the strenue of marketing and media circulation.  And the fact that it was recorded with dated materials gives it the feel that such an album with this particular subject matter should have.  It's a breath away from being club music, where the only reverb on the album is in the studio itself.<br />It's not just Jack with some girl named Meg playing drums. It's a devoted duo which makes some of the best music I've heard in what seems like ages.  If you're in the same situation as I am, you'll find this album hard to go a day without.
B001XVD21Y|5|I thought it was really good?
B0087JTAKW|2|I kept pushing myself to read on....knowing it was going to change and I would be so happy I continued. No, that did not happen! Not sure what Albom was thinking with this one.  I'm very puzzled about the &#34;time&#34; I spent trying to like it.
0385504225|3|what I expected and why I like Dan Brown novels. I did not find this to be the furious page turner of the Angels and Demons nor as controversial as the DaVinci Code. So I wondered what I was expecting. After thinking about it, I realized that the DVC and Angels and Demons were poking at perceived bullies and flawed institutions. The idea of hidden wisdom and knowledge being suppressed was in and of itself exciting and provocative. In the Lost Symbol, Dan Brown has changed the playing field. The evil is more remote and detached from our everyday experience and the tone is more pro-institutional (the institution being the Masons). All the normal hooks are there that send you to wikipedia to see if that is really true. However, his message was somewhat obscured. But still insightful and interesting. The last 25 pages of the book were to me this most insightful. I sense Mr. Brown believes we are in monumental, troubled times. His message is one that we need wisdom, not just knowledge. Knowledge, depending upon the mindset behind its use, can either create or destroy. I sense this is his plea to take the time to assess where we are (knowledge hidden from many who accept \\"conventional wisdoms and media sources) learn from history and change our course. Many who are looking for the riveting thriller may be disappointed. As for me, I think I'll go out and look at the stars tonight and ponder how I can be a part of change.
B003L77GGK|5|Addictive!!!
B00006WKY9|5|.. in my opion atleast. Think about this for a moment, \\"Taken By Force\\" is sandwiched between two landmark albums which makes it hard for it to get any credability. \\"Virgin Killer\\" is considered by many fans the definative 70's Scorps album while \\"LoveDrive\\" is  very important historically  in the Scorps career in which they embarked on the MTV route. <br /> <br />I will admit this upfront, even though i am a fan, i never liked any of their 80's MTV material too much. It was not that i thought it was bad, it's not, the 80's stuff is quite good actually, but it really never appealed to me the way the 70's material did because it was just too generic and commerical sounding for my taste; simplified riffs and generic stupid lyrics about loving/missing/wanting to be with your \\"woman\\" and \\"rocking out\\", almost every other song they wrote was about that. The lesson is that greed is a destructive force, it has the ability to completey ruin great bands (look at Metallica), for the Scorpions it meant abandoning creativity and artistic integrity for the almighty dollar, the damage has been done and can not be repaired, now you can hear \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" at almost every sporting event around the country. <br /> <br />This album was actauly the swan song for the meaningful and artistic Scorpions, it was the last album with Uli Jon Roth, who i feel was the creative nucleus of the Scorps of the old days. The songs are all pretty diverse; basic hard rock, metal, pyschadelic and beautiful ballads all inhabit this dark, moody work of art. It might throw some for a loop if they are only used to the 80's Scorpions.
B0043IMW4W|5|This is a great rocking record from Kenny Wayne Shepherd who plays his heart out across those Strats to a very overwhelming audience. The band played great, great sounds!
B00K0X1PYM|5|love it, a great tribute!
B000089RVX|5|evanescence is perhaps one of the most incredible bands breaking into the music scene right now.  i've recently gotten into the &quot;goth-rock&quot; sound, and this band has kept me comfortably situated between music genres.  i hang my head in shame while admitting that i didn't think there was anything particularly special about them the first one hundred times i heard their first single, &quot;bring me to life,&quot; on the radio and mtv.  i honestly thought that though amy lee had an amazing voice, evanescence would be somewhat of a &quot;one-hit-wonder.&quot;  i could not have been more wrong.  <br />my friend burned the cd for me [hey, i'm a 16-year old with no job. . .thus. . .no money] and i listened to it once.  i guess i wasn't listening very well because i neglected to listen again, thinking that the album wasn't as great as my friend had built it up to be.  however, a few months ago, i had the privilege of seeing them live.  wow.  if you think amy and the guys are great on the cd, you should definitely see them live.  they sound even better and their passion for music is obvious.  not to mention, amy is gorgeous and should be the envy of all girls in america.  i think the greatest aspect of their show, however, was that people, who listened to music from different genres that attended that music festival, all knew the words to their songs.  it's not often you find a band that appeals to both goth kids and top 40 radio listeners.<br />needless to say, after that performance, i was captivated.  their sound is indescribable and amy's voice, uncomparable.  i seriously prefer staying at home singing along with her voice rather than going out.  okay, so that's really sad, but i think you get the idea.  anyway, if you don't already have &quot;fallen,&quot; shame on you.  if you're hesitant and not yet convinced, try downloading &quot;going under,&quot; &quot;my immortal,&quot; &quot;tourniquet,&quot; &quot;taking over me,&quot; and &quot;whisper&quot; to get anidea of evanescence's genius.  and if they ever stop in your city for a show, make sure you catch it, even if the ticket price is outrageously high.  you will definitely not be disappointed.
B00079018K|5|I recomend this for everyone who loves Rock. It's english and has some english slang. It is hard hitting and so very fun. I love it. It's a favorite CD.
B00005JKOV|4|I don't think a lot of the people reviewing this film \\"get it\\".  It doesn't have a storyline in the usual sense - that much is true.  But there is a point to it - I just don't think the people rating it one star understand it.  You have to watch it to the very end.  It is visually stimulating although I can understand why many would easily tire of this type of animation.  For the length of the film it is basically one person listening to others' philosophical ramblings.  I think some people are turned off by this because they don't necessarily understand all of the ramblings or perhaps they need a more distinct storyline.  Is it a great film? - no.  Is it interesting both visually and intellectually? - yes.  Did I agree with all of the philosophies cited during it? - no, it would be impossible since many of them conflict with each other.  It's meant to be eye opening.<br />...
B0050DIWFC|4|A good read.  The author makes you feel the emotions the characters are experiencing.  You are never quite sure how this one is going to end.

0694524476|5|I haven't been so moved by a story of courage and destiny since Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea. This is the type of book that not only adds hope and vision to it's readers, but it also adds hope to the literary world. So many other authors fall short of this type of inspiration in their stories. Coelho has established a new standard among all authors who dare to inspire their readers.

1400069181|4|Blake Mycoskie is nothing but inspirational in Start Something That Matters and I am glad that this was the first book I read in 2012 on my quest to reading one book a week in 2012. The book outlines 6 steps to emulate the success of TOMs while contributing positively to the world around us.   1. Find Your Own Story  It is vital to have a compelling story to rally customers, generate word-of-mouth (mouse) and generate press buzz. The chapter gives concrete example of Adam Lowry and Eric Ryan and how they used the power of story to create the success of their company \\"method\\" (sales rose from $900,000 in 2001 to $100 million in 2010). That's some solid ROI. The chapter ends with a simple but effective assignment to find your own story.  2. Face Your Fears  The main message in this chapter is fear being always present but business fear is hardly fatal so the smart thing to do is face the fear and take action (only action is within our control).   3. Be Resourceful Without Resources  Lack of resources should not be used as an excuse not to start. Instead, the lack of resources should fuel creativity and foster an environment of long-term frugality. Look for free and low-cost options in everything.  4. Keep It Simple  Strip it down and keep your products as well as business model dead simple. That;s the simple message of this simple chapter.   5. Build Trust  How trust is critical for an organization's success with tips to build, grow and maintain trust within and outside of the organization.  6. Giving is Good Business  Giving is good business sense but rarely implemented by companies. the impact of giving is two-fold; i) it helps the world and ii) helps the company (in terms of karma or cash). This chapter ends with few practical ways to give even if it is not your intention to start a company based on giving.  The final chapter is about taking action. Not sitting on the sidelines but being in the arena. The book says that there are only 6 steps but I consider the final chapter the greatest step of them all.  I have created a comprehensive mindmap summary of the book which can be found at [...]

1455521183|3|Baldacci is out of ideas, I guess.  Whereas he once put out a number of interesting standalone books with complex characters, many of whom were fairly relatable, he now cranks out just a couple of series which seem derivative and stale.  The plots are exciting (but predictable), hence the 3 stars, but the characters are pretty predictable, the villains incredibly villainous, the heroes too stoic and superhuman in their killing powers, and the ultimate outcomes fairly easy to anticipate.<br /><br />The old Camel Club Series was great--a variety of characters, some of whom were average folks in extraordinary situations, and intricate plotting.  Now with the Robie/Reel series and the Puller series (which is too similar to Lee Child's Reacher series), the characters and the stakes they play for are always over the top.  Even the old Maxwell/King series which was a bit like the new series in that it took place on a big stage and starred two super-professionals who were somehow still interesting in their complex back stories and interpersonal dynamics, has petered out.  The last book in that series was silly (the plot) and poorly developed.<br /><br />Baldacci has run out of ideas at the moment.  He had a great run early.  Here's hoping he can find his muse again and start giving us some interesting characters in less predictable more relatable plots, like &#34;Absolute Power,&#34; &#34;The Winner,&#34; or &#34;Saving Faith,&#34; all of which were early classics that far surpass what he's doing now.  I recommend reading the whole Camel Club series, too, and the first few King/Maxwell books.

B004L49K20|4|So nice to have an album, especially with 15 tracks, that is great from start to finish. I love Duran Duran, so enthusiasts don't hate on me, but their albums usually suffer from having a few good singles with a lot of filler....not this album. Any one of these songs could be a strong single and as a whole it rocks! I've had this on constant rotation in my iPod for 2 months now

B0001DI0FI|4|It should come as no surprise that Peter Weir's 2003 film \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" would come away from the Academy Awards with two Oscars after receiving ten Oscar nominations.  Though he did not win the Oscar for Best Director (that honor went to Peter Jackson for \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\"), Peter Weir has been nominated several times in the past for Best Director for the films \\"The Truman Show\\" (1998), \\"Dead Poet's Society\\" (1989) and \\"Witness\\" (1986). He also directed the films \\"The Year of Living Dangerously\\" (1982) and \\"Gallipoli\\" (1981), for which he won the prestigious Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Director. <br /> <br />\\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" was based upon the 1970 novel \\"Master and Commander\\", written by Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000).  The novel was the first in a series of 21 novels featuring the characters Captain Jack Aubrey (of the British Royal Navy) and his friend, the surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The final incomplete novel, which was only half-written at the time of Patrick O'Brian's death, \\"The Final, Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey\\", was published in 2004.  Having co-written the screenplay with John Collee, Peter Weir's film adaptation of \\"Master and Commander\\" begins onboard the British Naval warship christened HMS Surprise off the coast of Brazil circa 1805.  The ship's captain, Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (the superb actor Russell Crowe), is under orders to find and stop a Napoleonic French naval warship, christened the Acheron, from creating havoc in the Pacific Ocean.  Unable to see well due to foggy conditions, one of the ship's minor officers, the tragic Midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby), momentarily catches a glimpse of an obscured object.  Alerting the ship, Captain Aubrey scours the horizon and sees bright flashes emanating from the fog.  Telling the crew the take cover, HMS Surprise is brutally attacked by the superior gun power of the Acheron.  Escaping into the fog, Captain Jack follows a course that takes the HMS Surprise around Cape Horn at the bottom tip of South America, then on a course that takes the beleaguered ship to the Galapagos Islands.  It is there that Doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who is also a naturalist, takes a keen interest in the unusual species that inhabit the islands.  A Would-be Charles Darwin, Maturin wants to explore the islands, but Captain Aubrey's main interest is the pursuit of the Acheron.  However, an unfortunate gunfire accident encourages Captain Aubrey to return to the Galapagos Islands, which works out well for both his objectives and Maturin's naturalist hobby. <br /> <br />With exquisite cinematography (for which the film won the Oscar for Best Cinematography), exciting naval battles, good acting and an authentic portrayal of the early nineteenth-century, \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" is an excellent film that is well worth watching.  However, it does a have a few flaws, with the largest being the complete lack of character development for any of the French warship's crew.  Instead, the Acheron and its crew is depicted as being essentially a buccaneer ship of bad-guys with nothing known about them or their mission.  Other memorable characters in the film include 1st Lt. Tom Pullings (James D'Arcy), 2nd Lt. William Mowett (Edward Woodall), the very young Midshipman Blakeney (Mark Pirkis), his friend Midshipman Calamy (Max Benitz) and Coxswain Barrett Bonden (Billy Boyd, who played the Hobbit Pippin in all three \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films between 2001 and 2003).  Memorable scenes include the foggy naval battle, the trip around the Cape, the arrival at the Galapagos, the accident, the surgery, the island walk and the final climactic scenes.  Overall, I rate the 2003 \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.
0062238868|5|This was a Valentine's Day gift for my husband & he LOVED it!!
B000RE619I|5|and downloaded the track, Fading which I will review at the very end.<br /><br />NEVER AGAIN . . . A great mid-tempo that's angrier than ANY of Kelly's previously released songs. Her first single. 8/10<br /><br />ONE MINUTE . . . A great up and down track about a lover who is so f'd up emotionally. \\"One minute you laugh,\\" Kelly confesses. \\"...then next minute you're slowly, sinking, into, something black!\\" A bit better than NEVER AGAIN. 8.5/10<br /><br />HOLE . . . Previously my favorite track by her ever! Now that SOBER owns that title, I must say that this great mid-tempo is still THE hardest track (rock-wise) that she's ever managed. Powerful vocal, emotionally delivered. :) 10/10<br /><br />SOBER . . . Very inspiring yet kind of sad all in one. It's dramatic ending builds and then soars. One of her most powerfully-written tracks. Love ya, Kells. ^_^ 11/10<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME . . . Didn't care for it much until it became a single (her official 3rd single, second video). After that, and not cause of the video, I was listening to it a bit more and gave it an actual chance and like it now. Some friends just never \\"hear\\" you. 8.25/10<br /><br />JUDAS . . . Another track I didn't originally like much. I did care for the lyrics but Kelly just seemed to scream and scream. I get it now. :) 8/10<br /><br />HAUNTED . . . Everyone likes to compare this with Breakaway's Addicted. I still see next to no connection and previously, like the two other tracks mentioned beforehand, didn't like this one much either. Couldn't relate too much and it just wasn't my cup of tea so I would more or less skip them all in a row! Now, Haunted is in the top 3 best vocally-delivered tracks and has great emotions, demonstrated vocally. 9/10<br /><br />BE STILL . . . Great ballad that I loved from the get go. Still one of the better tracks on MD and will remain to be. Super-relate-able and a slow jam. 10/10<br /><br />MAYBE . . . Great lyrics and yet again, very real. Another mid-tempo which seems to plague her CD (not in a bad way, mind you). Very honest here and lovely. Third best mid-tempo here (HOLE and SOBER are superior). 10/10<br /><br />HOW I FEEL . . . Nice quick guitar riffs. Funny but sad. It's about being single, trying to find someone, but falling flat because every guy you run into is tied to another. Yet again. \\"Babies; everywhere I look. Trophy wives; with their little black books.\\" An obvious favorite. 9/10<br /><br />YEAH . . . Kinda funky. It's different and Kelly makes it her own. Also, previously my favorite track (every song seems to switch up once in a while) but has been taken by HOLE and SOBER. 9/10<br /><br />CAN I HAVE A KISS . . . Even though it's not a single this gets played where I work, which I'm guessing is on some satellite radio. Could be mistaken. Either way, it's another mid-tempo (surprised?) that shines, showing Kelly's desperation for affection. \\"I tried to warn you, been a mess since you've known me, I can't promise forever, but I'm working on it; If I can't hold you, can I have a kiss?\\" 9/10<br /><br />IRVINE . . . To say that this ballad is not only heartbreaking but heart-wrenching would be an understatement. Everyone seems to cling to this song and it's for great reason. It's so sad, and shows how low Kelly was on tour in Irvine. \\"I don't have long, before I fade completely.\\" she slowly croons. It's sweetly-delivered but has brought out many tears I'm sure. Novelty runs a bit thin after you hear it 30x though. 10/10<br /><br />CHIVAS . . . It's actually a part of IRVINE, 1-2 minutes after it goes off unless you own the Japanese version of MD or another that may have it split. The Japanese version is the only one I know of that has them split. But CHIVAS is kinda funny. It's a kiss off too. Not the best that I've heard but still good. \\"It wasn't even good, trust me. I must've been so so so so...lonely.\\" She admits. It took me forever to hear this because I didn't own the album until a few days afterthe album came out and I bought it. Still not disappointed in that decision. No doubt that Kelly's CDs will continue to be a part of my collection. 8.25/10<br /><br />FADING . . . Should've made it to the U.S. release. JUDAS is decent but it basically repeats what DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME already catchily delivers. So in a sense, JUDAS could've been left off, and FADING, added right before HAUNTED cause it would have fit greatly! But now that I have heard this, I love it. If she's talking about herself then this song gets more points from me! \\"Amongst these faceless others, underneath the surface, everything's so backwards, it's all a lie\\". 9.25 + .5 = 9.75/10<br /><br />All in all some of it really had to grow on me. I heard NEVER AGAIN when I saw the video. It seemed slightly darker and much more angry than the light stuff on Breakaway was. But it didn't necessarily catch my attention then. I downloaded the songs (minus CHIVAS) online and I found that I loved some of the other tracks and that's when NEVER AGAIN started to shine.<br /><br />137.75 ÷ 15 = 9.183333333333<br /><br />9.18 = 4.59<br /><br />4.59 stars.<br /><br />If you're angry or sad AND that type of music helps you heal then let it grow on you. Most of it should. Some think it was rushed or just shouldn't have been released at all! I agree that everyone is entitled to an opinion, but their opinion IN MY OPINION is wrong, and sorely mistaken at best!<br /><br />Rock on, Kelly. Nice to see her get a bit harder musically. One of the best pop stars of the new ages.<br /><br />EDIT: I'm now next to positive that FADING is of her friend who so sadly killed herself...4/7/08: Kelly admits on a youtube video that Irvine was written about how she felt while touring in Irvine. She also says that she only delves so deep, and the rest is a secret. Probably too painful.inue to be a part of my collection. 8.25/10    FADING . . . Should've made it to the U.S. release.

B00BSBR9N6|4|I wasn't too sure at first but ended up loving it. It will make a great RoCo.
B004I11VZ0|4|Ip Man 2 capitalizes on the success of the Ip Man, unfortunately losing some of the raw emotion that comes through the original. One can sense that the scene direction and flow of the movie was placed predictably, as if following a formula, in the way that Michael Bay botched [[ASIN:B001KZIRM2 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]], but not as bad. The difference is Ip Man 2 is actually entertaining, the fight scenes are still beautifully choreographed; but while the original Ip Man made you identify with the protagonist, made you feel sorrow through his revenge that led to the final scene, Ip Man 2 seems trot along only because the audience already knows that Ip Man is a hero, and it tries too hard to outdo itself to drive home that point.    This movie reminded me a lot of [[ASIN:B001HUWQEK Jet Li's Fearless [Blu-ray]]], only it feels inauthentic.    Why did I still give it 4 stars? The original Ip Man was a martial arts masterpiece and Ip Man 2 had large shoes to fill. By itself, it was an entertaining romp, although with a predictable, and somewhat cheesy plot that follows tightly to martial arts film cliches, but it does this mediocrity extremely well. This would be an excellent Friday night rental, and you might even rewatch this if you weren't looking to be emotionally engaged, but just want to watch Donnie Yen kick ass.
B00BLCHZC2|2|If you like stories about rapists and murderers you'll love this series.
B001NLL8LA|5|Reacher is bad ass - as always.  It seems like the Reacher<br />stories get better and better.  I liked the theme of these book<br />plus to action was continuous with the twists and turns that<br />Child always puts in his Reacher stories.

0399146253|5|This is the eleventh book in the series featuring Dr. Kay Scarpetta whose job as the chief Medical Examiner of Virginia has put her in touch with many crimes and many conflicts with other law enforcement colleagues.  In previous novels Scarpetta has always come through her ordeals with criminals such as Temple Gault and Carrie Grethen.  These two in particular may have given Kay some of the worst experiences of her life yet they are far outweighed by her most recent assailant, the Warewolf.  Even though Kay is clearly the only living victim of this killer, she is still accused of killing Deputy Chief Diane Bray.  This mad, very hairy killer murdered Bray in &quot;Black Notice&quot;, Cornwell's previous novel.  Kay's most frightening crisis however, isn't being accused of Bray's murder, it is finally having to confront what happened to her former lover, the FBI agent Benton Wesley.  Kay is forced to bring out her feelings and examine them in the cold light of day, just like one of her autopsies.  Only when she does this does Kay realise that only she can help herself through this and that no longer can her niece Lucy and admirer Pete Marino, help her through what has to be the hardest time of her life.

B0029VUV70|2|When I realized this was based on a book I tried reading sooooo many times, but could not get past the first several pages, I should have turned it off. But, I was compelled to understand the story. That said. Didn't like it. Very slow moving and quite a depressing story line.
0316227706|5|Wonderful overview of a unique project! It amazes you by the beauty of the photographs. I will certainly recommend this book...
B00DBSZJRM|4|I really liked the story line the actors were brilliant.  The special effects were in great sync with the movie.
B004ADH1RI|5|its a classic. enough said
B0074VTHKM|2|Still a good book, but too childish in the delivery. Sufficiently captivating to read to the end, but not sufficiently engaging as a new Grisham plot.
0452289963|5|Eckhart Tolle in this book shows that all religions had preached ultimately the same message, quoting ancient and modern spiritual sources supporting his position. There are no abstract theories or arguments but the one simple assertion that the human ego is preventing humankind from realising 'Life's Purpose', which is to be one with the present, NOW.     I was brought up as a Buddhist, but reading Ekhart Tolle, I realised that the concept of 'dukkha' or suffering was very different from the concept as traditionally understood and learnt by me as a child. The Christian concept of 'original sin' and the Hindu concept of 'illusion' (maya) aligned with the Buddhist idea of 'suffering' (dukkha) is seen by Tolle as one of the common 'core insights'(p 8)about the 'dysfunction inherent in the human condition' (p 9).     Tolle then brings the reader to experience 'the breakup of the old egoic mind patterns and the emergence of a new dimension of consciouness.'(p 21). I remember having attended lectures given by Krishnamurthy many years ago, who repeatedly asked us to 'observe the observer within' in order to release ourselves from the grip of the ego. Tolle acknowledges the similarity of their common stance 'regarding the inner alignment with the present moment' (p 199).     Eckhart Tolle is no reclusive 'other-worldly' figure. His description of the University of London Senate House Library chimes well with my own period there as a mature student in the Sixties and later while engaged in postgraduate work in the early Eighties. He says little about what he was reading/studying, but that is immaterial given the central theme of the irrelevancy of such 'mind-forged manacles'.    There is just a hint of his past personal struggles when he talks about the 'pain-body' being 'an awakener' when people '... often reach a point where they feel their life is becoming intolerable, where they can't take any more pain, any more drama'(p 181). He adds,'Some people may feel, AS I DID, that they cannot live with themselves anymore' (my emphasis p 182).      Eckhart Tolle is an enlightened human being whose simple but profound message deserves to be heard and acted upon by every other human being in the world.
B00AIUUXHC|5|One of those rare games that I got for free from Amazon (free app of the day) and still play since converting to iPhone/iPad.  Lots of fun, outrageous, great graphics, and hilarious.  I love eating people.

B009UX2YAC|5|I really love this game because of the way it keeps changing love your blogger<br />And this is  really good for my little cousin
B000I5X81K|4|Love Josh Groban.  Somewhat different style than the last CD.  Good sound but not as good as past performanaces.  Saved money by going through Amazon.
B00BN2NQFU|4|Lovely movie, but not a movie in the traditional sense. The storytelling is kkkkiiiinnnda sequitur. Watch for the pretty and amazement, not the story and you will like this movie just fine.
B00000ITOY|5|I love this toy!  It is one of our favorites.  Well made, no plastic packaging, colorful!  My kids love playing with this.  We sort by colors, or shapes, or they carry it around singing the &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; song, pretending it is a cake!  We have purchased this for many birthday parties for friends!
B00632HWOG|2|I keep trying to send my freind an email but, the email will not go through. This experience was exasperating enough when the app crashed and erased my next attempt at communicating with my freind. Note, all this and I was next to the wireless router.

B004J4XGN6|1|I truly do not mean this review to anyway reflect poorly  on what Eric has achieved or the methodology that he used in doing so.  He does a good job of explaining his philosophies in this book.     The reaon hat I give it a one star is that I find the ideas discussed non novel.  I would thus steer you towards  Tim Brown of IDEO's books on Design Thinking.     I think you will find them much more enlightening than Eric's effort with similar ideas.    I do wish to congratulate Eric on his success in business and his willingness to discuss painful failures as well.
B0097PW7H8|5|Best app out there. Phone was always dead after a couple hours, even as a new phone. The battery doctor helps my phone last all day and into the late evening!!!!
B006BDHAX0|5|I got the free version of this and loved it so much that when I finished that version I actually paid for the full version.  I NEVER do that!  And I was not disappointed.  Well worth the $.
B00QROH0QK|5|Great movie.  Lots of funny one liners.
0399156690|5|This is one of Nora Roberts' better stand-alone (not part of a series) books in recent years.  She has a fantastic sense of humor and weaves that into a wonderful romance/mystery.  Both of her main characters are strong but not annoying or perfect.  Even the dogs seem real!  I also learned some things about canine rescue from this book.  It is a great summer read!
B000CNESU8|4|This film is in a way an adventure film about a TV newscaster who becomes a political predicator for the good of the TV channel, though he had been fired before this transformation. But the ratings are evanescent and under pressure from one top executive he shifts from absolute anarchism to some kind of responsible anarchism and that tinge makes him lose all his audience. Since it had all started with his menacing to commit suicide on the air on the following day when he was first fired, they just set up his being assassinated on the air which is supposed to be very good for the ratings. Apart from that façade, the film explores slightly but with no real conviction about what they say the circles of Angela Davis and the black revolutionaries and terrorists of California, without great conviction because you can imagine these people would never be authorized to get close to a TV station and would have been put on the top list of the wanted people by the FBI. The second side kick is the love affair between an old \\"middle-aged\\" news programmer and his young ambitious but definitely delirious psychotic female successor that ends in bull of course. The film is interesting and entertaining but it hardly qualifies as a truthful or even believable version of reality. How can a black man be authorized to go into an auditorium with a machine gun... under his coat for sure, but.... Even under President Ford that sounds pretty iffy. The only thing that it reveals very well is the paranoia of all Americans who are afraid of being bought out by the Japanese, then the Arabs, then the Chinese. In fact they are not bought out, they are selling themselves out to the higher bidder because they have such a deficit that they are beggars on a roundabout if not the dancing monkey on a merry-go-round whose tail the children must catch to get a free trip.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
B009YQJ322|5|Fast shipping & a fun exciting movie, my husband loved it! Its like watching a action packed video game, great gift for men.
B001TCAT9U|2|I was looking forward to this album as i love Depeche Mode. as soon as i got it i put it into my CD player.  The first thing i noticed was a re-emergance of the classic Depeche Mode Insturmental sound,  then the lyrics started.  The Lyrics clash with the acoustic intrumentals, at the moment I dont know where to rank it compaired with the previous albums.  It has some musical hint of Speak and Spell but clashes like Exciter.  Given some time i will most likely warm up to it.
B009KEN87O|5|Fun time waster, great levels of difficulty and tons of fun power ups. I was not excepting the shift to 3D.
B00004THAY|5|than not only Eric Clapton but B.B.King as well! Many of the songs are BB standards,and the addition of Eric only makes them better! What makes this album sing is the obvious BLAST these two old pro's had doing it! One of my favorite &quot;road trip&quot; picks!
B00000JNJ1|5|very impressive stuff! i bought this because i've always loved rod stewart's voice but been more or less indifferent to his music (aside from &quot;maggie may&quot; that is; never could resist that one). this is rod's first musical endeavor, a sloppy-as-hell, balls-to-the-wall, hotel-trashin' RAWK band. the guitarist ronnie wood would go on to replace what's-his-face in the rolling stones, and the other one, ronnie lane, wrote some of the best tunes, namely &quot;ooh la la,&quot; which you movie buffs will recognize as the song that so perfectly and triumphantly closes out the film _rushmore_. silkworm covered it on _lifestyle_ and that was the first version i heard: i thought it was a silkworm original until i saw the movie, but i never knew it was a faces track (not even when i ordered it). not to mention &quot;glad and sorry,&quot; which was my favorite song on golden smog's first album (golden smog was something of an alt.country supergroup featuring jeff tweedy and that guy from soul asylum). again, i thought it was a golden smog-penned tune, but turns out it was a faces song. wow. great stuff, here. i knew you had it in you, rod. <br />  <br /> since listening to this, i've gone back and rediscovered some of the early rod stewart albums like _gasoline alley_, _never a dull moment_, and _every picture tells a story_. it's all really great stuff!
B00L9B7IKE|4|Very different and intriquing.
B00000IZOR|5|excelente
B007BVOF8E|3|Loved the cast, but there was something about the storyline that couldn't keep me engaged. Maybe it was the complexity and I wasn't looking for that when I watched it. Dunno. All I can say is that I made it through and wouldn't watch it again.
B00DUGCLY4|5|I really love this app It makes u think twice I like this app because you can get hints or you could ask your Facebook friends to help you
B000HKYA1I|5|Great movie, it was not the typical storyline, very creative, and awesome cinematography (landscapes, etc). It will make you laugh and cry.
B000C20VRS|5|It is my favorite movie. My gf and I loved it....a must buy!! All time favorite. Need more like this.
B003VWU2WA|5|Even today there is still nothing that really competes with this thing for what it does.  We use it as a teleprompter control knob and it works fantastically for that purpose.

B00000J7J4|5|¿No conoce mucho de Santana? Pues santanamente le va a fascinar este CD. Créame, una inigualable compilación del Santana de antes, de hoy y de siempre. ¿Sí o no que su guitarra es inconfundible? Hasta puede saber qué  guitarra es la de Santana en &quot;The Calling&quot; (con Eric Clapton) ¿O  no?<br />¿Sólo habla español? -bueno, es obvio si está leyendo estas líneas-  pues se va a asombrar de cuánto puede identificarse con las piezas incluso  en inglés y con ritmos afro u orientales. Si no, escuche Smooth, y dígame  si Santana no captó todo lo que se expresa cuando por estas y otras  latitudes latinas se dice &quot;Ssssuaaaave&quot;. Ninguna pieza puede  completamente etiquetarse regionalmente (mi familia y yo descubrimos cada  vez que lo escuchamos un nuevo país, aunque para USA y para la Migra todos  seamos una sola cosa &quot;foreign&quot;) y creo que eso es lo atractivo de  este CD.<br />¿Para usted la música sólo es para bailar? Si no bailó con  Smooth (que no me lo creo) apuesto que lo hará con el resto. Y no me  refiero a mover el pie, estoy hablando de una música que le pone a bailar a  uno el corazón, y más si es &quot;espinado&quot;<br />¿Prefiere la música que  lo hace pensar? Entonces, escuche El Farol, y coincida conmigo que es la  que más &quot;dice&quot; de todas. Sin darse cuenta usted le habrá puesto  la letra.<br />Bueeeeno, así yo podría seguir, pero le quitaría a usted el  &quot;gusto&quot; de seguir descubriendo por sí mism@ este CD. Además que  tengo un límite de no sé cuántas palabras :-)<br />Aaah... casi lo olvido.  Cómprelo, es un CD que nació como un &quot;clásico&quot;. Un clásico de  este nuevo milenio que se inicia, y que nos &quot;llama&quot; desde sus  acordes y nos recuerda lo que podemos hacer del milenio... tan mixto  racialmente, tan diverso y tan unificador a la vez, tan supernatural,  pues.<br />(Disculpas a los especialistas en música, para quienes no va  dirigido este comentario, puessoy una simple Equatorial Harlem Mona Lisa  :)
B006RA0E5I|5|Compact size, but doesn't feel tiny in my hand. I like the micro-adapter, it seems like there's nothing sticking out of my laptop. The rubberized texture is great! I love the rubberized paint that Lenovo uses on their ThinkPads, I bought this hoping it would resemble that & it does. The scroll wheel tilts left & right for added functionality, and the USB adapter can be stowed inside the device. The tracking is great & works on most surfaces you'd expect it to work on. Easy to set up, juts plug it in & go on Win7 & Win8. Advanced options & functionality are available. The only thing I would change is make the mouse buttons quieter, but that's a minor concern.<br /><br />Also, it included the batteries!
B002RSDW80|4|As most of my friends could tell you, I am no cook.  But when I saw this movie I began to believe that if Julie Powell could cook all 524 of the recipes in Julia Childs' book \\"Mastering The Art of French Cooking\\", then maybe I could at least cook.<br /><br />\\"Julie and Julia\\" tells two stories.  First is the tale of Julia Childs moving from learning to cook French to publishing a best selling cookbook.  Meryl Streep is convincing in her task of playing the culinary legend Julia Child.  Stanley Tucci is brilliant in playing Julia's gentle and supporting husband, Paul.  The scenes of Julia's adventure in locations in  Paris, are realistic and beautiful.  Paul's patience as his wife struggles with critics and the snobbery of the French cooking school owner is the stuff of legend.<br /><br />The second story relates how a frustrated government office worker releases her hidden writing and cooking talents in a effort to cook all of Child's recipes within 365 days and record her efforts in an Internet blog.  Amy Adams does an outstanding job of portraying Julie Powell and the challenge and emotionally charged effort.  We see the impressive dedication the project requires and Julie knows it.  When a friend says that acquaintances claim Julie is a bitch, Julie simply agrees.<br /><br />Mostly it is the minute detail of cooking that attracted me.  As I watch Meryl learn to flip a quiche in a frying pan I was inspired.  When I witnesses Meryl and Amy actually debone a duck, I knew they were telling me that I could do this.  I am tempted to collect the ingredients and make some of the numerous sauces detailed in Child's book.  First, however, I have an Amazon friend, Aceto, who is indeed a noted chef.  I will ask his advice before I jump into the fray.  Aceto, is this possible for a klutz like me?<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Julie and Julia\\".  This is not only an entertaining movie, I is a great learning experience.
B007VUA7VO|4|Very handy app, making it easy to check how much you have left \\"in the bank\\"' For a non techie like me its much easier than going through all the kindle menus. I don't use all the facilities this app has, but I still rate it.

1935251740|5|Honestly, I didn't understand a lot about quantum physics before I read this book.  I think I know have only a very basic understanding of the implications of this field of research - even after reading the book.  But the book opened my eyes to not well understood questions our research has brought up, and it facinated me.  I think Lanza has dared to propose a theory that explains what science has demonstrated - and if he is right, it has far-reaching implications -- and possibilities.  Thrilling and fascinating!
B004A8ZWSS|2|1.  This is one of those movies where you wanted to like and should have liked... but in the end, the reality was very disappointing.  Actually worse yet, it's one of those movies which just leaves one apathetic;  ie it was ok, but nothing beyond that.  It's so irrelevant that it's not worth even discussing at work with friends etc...<br />2.  Bottomline, skip this dud of a movie, unless you happen to come across it for free etc... But even then, is your time worth anything?

The Muppets is filled with laughs and good storyline, leading to a good message. The Muppets is one of the best family movie I've seen all year and Jason Segal & Amy Adam do a fantastic job in this amazing movie! A+
B000002MP2|5|Green Day hit the mainstream in 1994 with their 3rd album DOOKIE. Their 4 singles from the album, &quot;Longview&quot;, &quot;Basket Case&quot;, *&quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;*, and &quot;When I Come Around&quot;, are reason enough to buy the CD. With supporting powerhouse fan favorites like &quot;Burnout&quot; and &quot;She&quot;, it is a complete punk-pop experience. It is quite agreed that this is the most popular album by the band, for good reason. Personally, it is my favorite CD of all time, but I am trying not to bias this review (as I am a big Green Day fan). If you like pure punk genius like &quot;Basket Case&quot;, or rather semi-balads like &quot;When I Come Around&quot;, or can appreciate subtle humor concerning &quot;Pulling Teeth&quot; or the secret track &quot;All By Myself&quot; (at the end of Track 14 &quot;F.O.D.&quot;), then you should buy this sheer classic.<br />*Did not receive much radio playtime and did not create a music video because of copyright problems... &quot;Welcome To Paradise&quot; appeared on KERPLUNK, the band's 2nd album, which was under the LOOKOUT label, not REPRISE.*

B00BAXFECK|5|Will I likely ever read this again in entirety? Nope. Was I annoyed at its length at times? Yes. Is Donna Tartt one of the most fantastic writers ever? Absolutely. The pictures she creates are impeccable and the small but giant questions she raises are fascinating. Well done.

0792151712|1|First of all may I address the hacks of Hollywood: CAN'T YOU PEOPLE SPELL ANY OTHER NAME BUT JACK??!!! Come on, it's the most overused name and it's in almost all the movies! I think there's a button on your word processors that spell \\"Jack\\" and all you have to do is press it and it will print it over and over in your script, kind of like the \\"F\\" word that you folks use in place of actual LANGUAGE! <br /> <br />It was bad enough that Cameron couldn't use as characters people who actuall LIVED; he had to go and invent the most BORING characters who ever ate up 16 hours of my time (well, it FELT like 16 hours!) <br /> <br />First of the casting! Leonardo DiCrapio looks like (and always will) an aging teen-ager. If Leo strained really, reeeeally hard, he might sprout a 5 hair mustache! He's just another of the aging boy types Hollywood is all agog about: Jude Law, Colin Farrell, Orlando Bloom and others. The only real adult male actor around today is Russell Crowe and he has totally karate chopped his career as brutally as he does hotel employees. <br /> <br />And Kate Winslet! Lord, in terrible need of an extreme makeover! Nose needs refining, body needs to drop 45 pounds at least! She looked more like the older girl next door than Leo's lover, or maybe like his sister which is incest and that's just eeeeewwwwww!! And the hair color on Winslet and her \\"mother\\" who bore absolute NO physical resemblance, but they tried to \\"fool\\" us by dousing both with Lady Clairol Un-natural Tangerine Red #45. <br /> <br />As for the excrutiatingly irritating \\"love story\\" that seemed to suck all the attention and lenghthen this stupid movie, listen up all you ditsy teen-age girls. Here's what really happened if Jack had lived: <br /> <br />Jack and Rose run away to New York to live by the sea... in a cardboard shack with a corrugated tin roof. Since Rose has STUPIDLY put love above security and Billy N.Zane's (well, that's the characters he plays!) millions of bucks, she's paying for it now. <br /> <br />She's had one kid, added another 60 pounds and has another Little Leo in the oven. New York summers are very HOT and humid,especially if you live in a hot tin box. Leo never comes home from the bar where he hangs with his mates because the big cow beats him up for not working to give her the rich life she almost had. Unfortunately there are no phones, so she can't call up Billy N.Zane and beg him to let her come back, but Billy's into appearances and doesn't want a fat broad on his arm who has un-natural orange hair and is breast-feeding!  But I think Billy mercifully drowned before he had to endure to the end of this dreadful flick. I don't know, don't remember, don't care. <br /> <br />So to make ends meet, Rose must scrounge aluminum cans so she and the little King Of The World won't starve.So much for Happily Ever After. <br /> <br />This is reality girls, so make this movie a lesson in life! Go for the money! <br /> <br />Now as for the title of this review, if I'd had a dollar for each time Rose was screaming Jack, I'd have paid this month's mortgage! And why was she, with the generous body fat, floating on the raft/door when the skinny meatless squirt was in the ice water? You'd think she'd have taken turns. I was hoping someone would just shove Leo into the water so she'd stop yelling \\"Jack, Jack, Jack.....!\\"like yelling your name in your face will keep you from freezing.  <br /> <br />And dropping the big jewell into the ocean??! WHAT? ARE YOU CRA-ZEEEEEE??!! Absolutely no way! You think Jack is down there alive thanking you?? No, put that baby in the bank for nine decades, draw interest, if you don't want the money, give it to the victims of Hurricane Katrina for God's sake! Sheesh, this movie just got dumber as it went along. <br />    <br />Anyway, my 2 cents and this could have been good if it had only stuck to what really happened. Maybe someday someone will make this story correctly.

B005SJIP2S|4|Either you like the post Anderson Yes or not. Oliver finally shines on the last track, Starship Trooper, and there were times I was listening that I forgot it wasn't Jon. Yes, I counted two vocal flubs. Chris doesn't seem to be as snappy on Tempus Fugit than the original. But we have it live, right?<br /><br />Nice to have a well recorded version of the tour, but at one of the shows I was at Howe did some very creative things with the acoustic intro to Roundabout that I wish he had played this night.<br /><br />The umpteenth live versions of standards we could do without, but we do get four new tracks live, and a presentation of this lineup which toured for several years. I do like it, and like Fly from Here more and more as I hear new little parts.<br /><br />New Yes. It is the new reality. Everyone else has changed, even Jon once before, and Chris too if you count ABWH.
B007I2BZIE|3|Rush just keeps bringing it! Their energy, musicianship, and writing just gets better and better.  This wonderful concept album shows how good these 3 rock & roll legends are, but the recording and mix by Nick Raskulinecz is way too heavy handed. It's of the \\"LOUD AS POSSIBLE\\" and then COMPRESS THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF IT\\" to control any clipping/distortion/digital artifacts method of recording, and I think it ruined this fine effort by Rush. Perhaps the studio set-up that Raskulinecz has flatters this sound, but my audiophile system does not!  Too bass heavy and squashed, no dynamics, drums and guitar washed out, and lack of definition. I wonder if the members of Rush were able to listen to this on anything outside of the studio. I sure hope Rush will consider a re-mix and re-issue on this masterpiece, and dump Raskulinecz on their next recording!<br /><br />Since my original post, I received a comment about my playback gear perhaps being sub-par. Much of my review of this CD is based on my listening via two high quality headphone amps, one a tube unit and the other transistor based. Headphones used were Denon AH-D7000's and Sennheiser HD-600, both top end and excellent quality headphones.<br /><br />I stand by my thoughts on the sound quality. It is a muddy, bass heavy recording.  But the tunes themselves are as most here have stated, some of Rush's best and quite amazing! I still would recommend it to Rush fans.

B000002HRE|1|I don't think Metallica should use the prefix \\"Metal\\" in their name anymore. This is more like \\"Grungtalica\\" or worse \\"Post-Grungetalica\\" or the more popular title \\"Alternica.\\" This title is not even metal, with the exception of the only good song \\"Fuel.\\" If you want to get a good metal/thrash album, get Metallica's first four albums. If you really want something from the \\"nineties,\\" get Countdown to Extinction by Megadeth or get the Pantera albums. Even the Iron maiden albums with Blaze Bayle are ten times better than this garbage. Just do yourself a favor and do NOT get this album. If you really want Fuel, buy it on I-tunes or download it or something, just don't buy this album.

B00005K9LM|5|Judas Priest's 1984 release Defenders of the Faith is my third favorite 1980s Priest album behind Screaming for Vengeance and barely behind British Steel.  Many of the tracks off Defender are better than British Steel but it is not quite as solid as the 1980 classic.  <br />Defenders offers some of the best all-time Priest tracks: &quot;The Sentinel,&quot; &quot;Love Bites,&quot; and &quot;Some Heads Are Gonna Roll.&quot;  They have a unique guitar sound that is difficult to explain in words.  The sound gives me images of a futuristic gladiator arena where metal gods do battle overlooked by the feared Sentinel.  What would that sound like?  Listen to this album. My favorite track, however, is the power ballad &quot;Night Comes Down.&quot;  It is beautiful with, as one would expect, amazing Rob Halford vocals.<br />The rest of the album is fairly solid.  The single &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot; is fast and furious.  Although it is not one of my favorite tracks, hearing Halford sing at breakneck speed is incredible!  &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; is a Sentinel-style song with that unique guitar sound. &quot;Rock Hard Ride Free&quot; is a catchy rocker.  &quot;Eat Me Alive&quot; got the PMRC leaders' pantyhose in a knot with the highly suggestive lyrics (probably giving some guys the creeps now that Halford has officially &quot;come out&quot;) and the line &quot;I'm gonna force you at gunpoint.&quot;  It is not one of their better tracks.  &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith&quot; starts out like &quot;Eat Me Alive II&quot; with some risqué lyrics but ends up being a salute to metal.  The title track is just a 1:30 chanting of &quot;We are defenders of the faith.&quot;  I'm not a big fan of songs that celebrate the band, its fans, and what they do (Ram it Down has a lot of self congratulatory songs like &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and &quot;I'm a Rocker&quot;).  It's disappointing that this song was chosen as the live bonus track.  The bonus studio track does not seem to wowanyone either.  Though it ends on a low note, most of Defenders of the Faith is excellent and one of Priest's best.

B000003JAB|5|Many consider this to be Trowers finest hour. As for myself I might enjoy Trowers first, &quot;Twice Removed from Yesterday's&quot; spacey strecthed out Hendrix inspired &quot;Bold as Love&quot; peroid explorations a hair more, but &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot; is Trowers most focused album. It is hard to argue with the sonic explosion that is &quot;Day of the Eagle,&quot; that starts this album. Just killer heavy duty blues/rock guitar turned up to eleven, then followed by one of Trowers finest heavy riffed spacey songs, the title song &quot;Bridge of Sighs.&quot; WOW! I remember hearing these two songs in tandem back in the 70's &amp; I was hooked for good. Trower is truely a master of his instrument, his thick tone, shimmering sustain, sense of melody, &amp; passion really come off as some of the heaviest most melodic guitar playing known to rock. Pigeoned holed as a Hendrix clone, Trower is much more than that. He is Hendrix's ace disciple easly rivaling his mentor's inspiration with this album, &amp; maybe even surpassing it.<br />The passionate singing of bassist Rob Dewar is an overlooked treasure on many of Trowers albums. Here on &quot;Lady Love&quot; Trower &amp; Dewar crescend in a seamless whole of sincere delicate axemenship &amp; impassioned singing to make it a listeners delight. On &quot;Too Rolling Stoned&quot; Dewar shows us he is able to thump the bass to Trowers rollicking leads &amp; riffs. Trower shows some of his funk on &quot;The Fool &amp; Me.&quot; Really there is not a clinker in this whole album, it's is a collection of flawless work from a master of his instrument. For lovers of killer Rock guitar!!!<br />***** Stars

B008DVJO8C|5|I think this is the best album they have made so far, but many of their earlier fans may disagree with me. This is due to the harder style that the band has implemented in to this album and also in the A Star Crossed Wasteland album (my second favorite album of theirs). I enjoy their music from their earlier albums as well just not enough to buy the albums. Their music is great for working out, it helps me stay focused and energized. I would love to see more albums like this one in the future, lots of great songs.

B005ZOBNOI|5|Seeing that a book's plot involves cancer is enough to turn even the slightest of hypochondriacs away.  Add to that the fact that John Green's The Fault in Our Stars is in the Young Adult genre, and most people over the age of 16 would probably move right past it in the bookstore.  But take it from someone in her 30s who just finished the book and loved it (and is a mild hypochondriac): this is a book you need to read.<br /><br />The plot concerns Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster, the latter of which is the book's narrator.  They both had/have cancer, only Hazel's is a bit worse.  She reminds us regularly of her condition via her trips to the hospital, her bleak outlook on her future, and her oxygen tank (which she has named \\"Philip\\"), which must be attached to her at all times or else she struggles to breathe.<br /><br />It's at a cancer support group that she meets Augustus Waters, a former basketball player with a fake leg who once battled the cancer that stole it.  Augustus is instantly smitten with Hazel, but Hazel hesitates to entertain his advances because she knows she doesn't have a whole lot of time left.  Augustus is more of a seize-the-moment kind of guy, haven't looked death in the face and all, and he continues to pursue Hazel, even if it's just to be her friend.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus trade their favorite books (he reads hers, she reads his), and they end up traveling to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author.  While this may sound like it's steeped in improbability, it actually works rather well with the story, and it becomes an experience to remember, that much is certain.<br /><br />Another entertaining character in the book is Augustus and Hazel's friend Isaac, a poor kid whose girlfriend dumps him when she finds out that he has to have his other good eye removed (after he lost the first one to cancer).  Isaac, however, has a great attitude toward his cancer, and he takes it all in stride.  He's even able to continue to play video games that work via voice prompts.  Just don't let your spiteful little brother come in the room and scream a command for your character to die.<br /><br />What makes this book so magical is that it can make even the most hardened of readers both laugh and weep.  The dialogue is more true to life than that found in a majority of books out there today, particularly in the young adult genre (a genre that this novel transcends), which has a tendency to either sugar-coat life or patronize the reader.<br /><br />Incidentally, The Fault in Our Stars will be coming to a movie theater near you in June.  Because Green was on set himself to supervise the film's production, the flick sounds like one to look forward to, and one that won't let us down by crapping all over our imaginations with a less-than-stellar adaptation.  With a touching read that's incredibly well written, heartfelt, and deliciously cynical, any author who can evoke the emotions you feel from this book deserves to have his work turned into a movie.ames that work via voice prompts.

B005S9EKCW|5|Far from being just another musical on film, this is a retelling of Hugo's tale in its own unique way. Much has been made of the &#34;live&#34; singing, which was an excellent and gutsy technique...but there are so many other cinematic elements that make this a ground-breaker that it will endure, I think, for decades. The combination of close-ups and hi-def images give the story a gritty realism that enhances the characters and brings the time and place home in a new way.

B005CM9DX6|5|We saw a hint of things to come with the brilliant \\"Watershed\\" a few years back.  While there were still a few measures of death metal roaring still present,  it was not hard to predict Mikeal Akerfeldt's breaking away from those grunting vocals and open the way for a huge boost in melody and meloncholy.  The album \\"Damnation\\" was also a clean vocals album but much more mild and frankly, for all its brilliance, a very mournful album fit for a cloudy drizzly day when the whole world seems to be in a funk.<br />  \\"Heritage\\" isn't a follow-up to \\"Damnation\\" so don't let those comparisons throw you off.  It's really quite simple.  Why grunt and growl when you have a voice like Akerfeldt's?  It is a waste of one of the most beautiful singing voices in popular music.  \\"Burden\\", from \\"Watershed\\" could and should have been a monster single, crashing into FM radio territory like the classic cut it is instead of being tucked away for Opeth fans.  While one doesn't and shouldn't really care about that \\"breakthrough\\", it would sure be a nice payday for a band that certainly has earned and deserves one, but that would mean making room for twits who are singing through synthesizer vocoders and sound like electric mouse farts.<br />  The sound has taken a turn in the way back machine to the seventies and prog heaven.  You can hear the thickness and the feel of the old analog sound, including somewhat muffled drums.  Flutes scurry about, a cheesy Hammond style organ flavors everything, and you can't help but feel the long arm of early Yes and maybe even Jethro Tull reaching out with their influence.  The big difference is that Opeth, Mikael Akerfeldt in particular, is a superior songwriter and vocalist, not to mention guitarist.  Older prog outfits tended to gravitate toward the outlandish with silly concepts and music that had no real foundation, its players too busy trying to out play each other.  Opeth takes the best of prog, the musicianship, and leaves the excess behind, wisely utilizing their immense skills but knowing when to turn them down.  \\"Heritage\\" might be the album of the year, and will delight Opeth fans as well as infuriate those who do not tolerate stylistic freedom.  If one is mad because Opeth refuse to do the same thing time after time, then it's that person's intolerance and short sightedness to blame, not the band's.<br />  People who buy one note scream bands and judge them by their look and popularity, not to mention wanting to be hip and recognized at Hot Topic, who makes lame no talent bums like Asking Alexandria or others with those weed eater haircuts and the inability to sing a musical note or play more than two chords rich wouldn't get Opeth, anyway.ilizing their immense skills but knowing when to turn them down.  \\"Heritage\\" might be the album of the year, and will delight Opeth fans as well as infuriate those who do not tolerate stylistic freedom.

B00R7FRTWI|5|This is the story of Alan Turing, the inventor of the digital computer.  Some say &#34;modern digital computer.&#34;  The first digital computer was counting with your fingers (sometimes called &#34;digits&#34;).  Then a few thousand years ago the Chinese invented the Abacus which is a simple mechanical digital computer, and since then there have been mechanical calculators which are technically digital computers.  However, Alan Turing invented the Universal Computer now called the Turing Machine which even today can simulate any digital computer (although too slow to be practical).  The Turing Machine is a beautiful theoretical construct rivaled only by Einstein's theories, and Claud Shannon's Mathematical Theory of Information.  In the movie and reality, Turing constructs a special purpose electromechanical digital computer to break the Nazi code machine during World War 2.  While Turing worked in England, Physicist Richard Feynman used to tell the story of how the calculations were made to develop the Atomic bomb during the same period.  For every calculation 3 great geniuses would sit and calculate to see if they got the same answer.  John Von Neuman (also a great computer scientist) made all the calculations in his head while Enrico Fermi used an old fashioned mechanical digital calculator called an &#34;adding machine,&#34; and Feynman used a slide rule.  All 3 usually agreed to 3 decimal places.  So American computing was almost no where when Alan Turing was building his code breaking computer.  In the move and reality, the Allies could not act on all the intelligence learned by decoding their messages because it would tip off the Nazi's that their code machine had been broken.  Alan Turing, being the typical Aspberger Genius, came up with statistical calculations that would determine who lives and who dies.  He did the right thing -- which would still be the practice today.  Since the American government does such thorough Survellience of the American people, almost every law suit could be resloved using secret government information, but they can't divulge their secret evidence because it would compromise the survellience system.  This was a great stress on Alan Turing as it would be on anyone who has to decide who will live and who would be sacrificed.  Although the British credited Alan Turing for shortening the war and saving millions of lives, British anti Gay bigots murdered him.  These days the British bigotry has shifted to Marijuana users, and away from Gays.  Hope the English rise above their bigotry some day.<br /><br />When my son was 7 years old, I taught him Alan Turing's theories and allowed him to cheat on his math homework by using a calculator.  He became a mathematical genius child prodigy.
1781162646|4|Overall this was a good read. The characters were likeable. The prose moved right along. The plot was interesting, but a little weak. I anticipated what was going to happen. The clairvoyant characters were a bit unbelievable. The hero was saved at the last minute in a way that was far fetched.
B000GG4XHO|5|CONEY ISLAND BABY recorded after the debacle that was METAL MACHINE MUSIC, is Reed at his most accessible. Songs full of melody with real hooks to them, lyrics that are funny, poignant, and personal sung in a tone that varies from jaunty to haunting, this is Reed for people who are afraid of the Lou Reed they've heard about. There's still challenge here for one who listens closely, but it is covered by a veneer of polish and nostalgia. This   is a nice entry into Reed's long and eclectic career, and can be enjoyed by the casual or long time fan.  The extras are interesting add-ons, but the original 8 songs from the happy-go-lucky \\"Crazy Feeling\\" to the evocative title track hold together as well as anything Reed has ever done.
B00IEBE7GK|5|I have really enjoyed this game. It is challenging, sometimes maybe even a little frustrating, but not impossible. It really made me think and I hope they come out with another one soon.
B004QOB8SO|5|I'm a huge fan of the book series and some of the older Sherlock Holmes TV series and this went above and beyond my expectations (just like the first season which blew my mind XD ).  I would (and do) recommend this to everyone - it is that good.
B00JXETVRC|5|New rock from the master's of Heavy Metal, Judas Priest.
B00BHHIWQO|4|This is a great free app. However when your 5 plays run out you have to wait 7 minutes or buy more plays which can be annoying.
B0064MGU98|5|Excellent! Love the show! Deals with today's problems and the Wife has a lot of character and is believable! Love it!
B000002W9Q|4|Great memories for those who enjoyed the 1980s movie and soundtrack!  I had thought that I only wanted to hear and dance to the music again, but  I now want to watch the movie once more as well.
B00LU0P9L4|5|great game love it definately challenges the brain would recommend downloading it to my friends and my family thank you
0062192930|4|Typical Crichton novel: plausible, fast action, details, great reader. Keep this one in your 'I'm gonna read this one again' library.
0440423228|5|This book (and the first one) is a great gift for fantasy fans!  My elderly husband and his adolescent grandson both loved it.  My husband has embraced graphic novels because of their ties to the comic books of his youth, if you have not considered a graphic novel for an older man, try it.  And, this is a great series, these books are &#34;keepers&#34;.
B000001AKM|5|i cant begin to say how much i love this cd. i will say my husband must be getting sick of it...it has been in my cd player for almost a year. i even listen to it while i in the shower. i never expected to like it this much  it has made me buy the rest of his cd's..even his sad songs make you feel  good. his voice is truely heaven
B00AHXIC50|5|I like all the songs except for &#34;Money Make Her Smile&#34; because I am so sick of hearing songs about stripping, tipping, and making it rain, even if it is with Bruno Mars amazing voice. I love how diverse he is on this album. The songs do give you the feeling that you have heard them before (Locked out of Heaven, Treasure, Moonshine), so it is clear who his musical influences were on this album. But it is still very good and well produced.
B008A1NSTG|3|Was a good movie plot and had a lot of good ideas and plot twists in it. However, it was filled with so much anti-Republican-politics and anti-Reaganism that the other parts of the movie got drowned out by the screaming rhetoric, regardless of your party affiliation or which side your political views fell on. They could have very easily played up certain parts of the movie that were of real interest and played down the trumpet section a little and had a much better movie.
B00AGOGOLE|5|My brother recommended it, and I just love it. It is so easy to use, My pictures are easy to find
1442359935|4|As always, Harris is clear and thoughtful in his discussion.  He does a nice job anchoring his ideas in both science and theory and tells us where the science is lacking.  He presents both mindfulness and meditation in a way that is acceptable to people of science and to people of both science and faith.  I thought that he spent a bit too much time telling us why he rejects that beliefs and rituals of religion; it seemed like a distraction from his main points.
B004DLPXAO|5|Now I can read and sync my books between my plain vanilla Kindle and my new Galaxy Tab.  I still like the plain Kindle for &#34;pure&#34; reading, but like carrying the tablet on trips for it's wider versitility.  This app works perfectly.
B009AMAGQM|5|I loved this story. What an imagination, and the ending. . .well. . .I couldn't have done better myself. That is, if I ever wrote a movie, that is.  :)  And the seller did fine, too. the dvd arrived on time and in great condition. Thanks.
B004I744AS|5|This is more than a dictionary its very useful information just like typing a word into Google it gives u lots of information ..
B00AREIAI8|4|Great graphics. Easy to learn. Great for all ages. Very addicting game. I hope you all<br />enjoy it! Have fun!!
B0068LYEHA|5|Caitlin Moran is raw and funny and honest in a way that very few women dare to be. I enjoyed her book immensely and have recommended it numerous times to other friends. I laughed out loud many times while reading it. She manages to be honest, funny, outraged, and warm, all at the same time. No mean feat!!<br />Read it.
B006LSZECO|5|So far the book is very rich with descriptive language.  I have not finished it yet, but i'm enjoying every page so far.
B0034DGPEU|5|I felt for the slaves in this book, and the indentured slave Lavinia!  Not to mention the 2nd or 3rd class women, who were &#34;the women of the house&#34; definitely needed a little bit of feminism. I highly recommend, it was a page turner for me!
B0012FHGCW|5|\\"Into the wild\\" is a movie about a boy named Christopher McCandless who just up and leaves his wonderful life to go on a trek across america. He's gotten tired of the way life is and how dependent people are on material things and he just wanted to live life with nothing but himself and his back pack. He experiences a lot in his trek across america and finds out how amazing nature is, how much fun a person could have with nothing to his name. In the end, it doesn't fare too well for him. The movie, as well as the book i'm sure, just have a huge impact on a person. It makes you realize that we, as humans, are so dependent on materialistic things. We rely on money, technological items, processed foods, and etc. He left behind Money, his identity, a warm roof over his head, and the ability to walk into a store and buy food at the drop of a dime (literally). He had a great time doing so too. I cried at the end and went on throughout the day with a new look on life. \\"Into the wild\\" made me realize that there's so many things in my life that i don't need and that i'm dependent on; that i could live without. This movie is just amazing and you'll love it!
B002MQYOFW|5|I heard all hype about the movie so I decided to read the books. I wasn't disappointed, I really enjoyed all the books. I read through them all and couldn't put the Kindle down. Only complaint is after reading them all I went to see the first movie... Compared to the books, that was disappointing.
B004V73FGE|1|Sucked, sucked and sucked!!
B004ODLUGM|5|My son and I love The Gruffalo - it's a well-made adaptation of a great children's book. Helena Bonham Carter's narration is first-rate. We've watched it many times! Nicely-done animation too.
B008JFUS0U|5|Saw this in the movies with my daughter.  Loved it again on DVD.  This one is better than the first and love the story line especially as it pertains to the brothers.
B000002LGW|5|I can still remember when I first heard this album. I had it on cassette tape. I had an immediate positive reaction to the music. I was very glad when the cd version was released. this is a wonderfully documented account of a truly original band.As I listen to it, this many years later, the magic still remains. Some live albums fail in the attempt to keep the music fresh. This album succeeds in not only keeping the material fresh it also keeps it exciting!
B000NY12CI|5|One of the most enlightening books I've read in a long time.
B00BD99JMW|2|The book was decent but she killed off the Heroine.  How could she?  It destroyed the whole book.  I hope they change the movie ending when it comes out.
B00ATDOVNK|4|i would recomend this game the wife and i  had fun with this app! good even for us old folk. game on
B00KWVZ750|4|Good game fun to play need to add more levels.
B005LAIIN0|5|Awesome movie!
B0089LOG02|4|THis was an amazing book about a historical event I only recently learned about.  I loved the way the two parallel stories intersected.  Written in a way that made the story believable and made you care for the characters.  Left off one star because I wanted more from the book...ended too soon although it ended well.
B00FN811SY|5|My Only Source of Truth for My Electronic Device.
B008476HBM|2|Stopped reading after ten chapters.  Suppose Sci-Fi and Fantasy are more interesting to me than this &#34;gossip&#34; soap opera (manipulative) type story.
0064431789|5|Best kid's picture book ever! I always give it for a new baby gift.
B000005S6B|5|well, i liked floggin molly and dropkick murphys, so pogues were recommended to me. <br />all i have to say is, MacGowans voice is the sexiest voice ive ever heard. man i love his voice. yeah i love irish accents...ahh.
B001GXYBY6|5|After buying a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom game for my brother I wanted to know more about Tatsunoko, I remember watching a few Anime episodes on Cartoon Network when I was a little kid, but didn't remember much about it, I just knew it was one of the oldest Anime next the Mazinger Z, if not the oldest that got world wide acceptance. And when I heard the movie was made by the Wachowski brothers, the same people that produced and wrote the Matrix trilogy, I knew I had to get it, specially considering they were also writing this one, when they often only produce. I feel good to have it on my collection, great buy, it is kind of rare since not many people know about it, and the subject is cool, I mean is Tatsunoko, plus they made it look very big production movie like with all the film filters and colors. I recommend it specially if you want to watch it with your young brother or son, they will like it because it is kind of a kid movie as well, and it is mostly about cars, with hot wheels alike tracks and races.
1781162646|2|I thought I was getting Stephen King.  Harry Potter was scarier.  At least it was short.  At his worst Stephen King has diarrhea of the word processer but at least there's a bang at the end.  This boring story meanders around hinting at haunted amusement park rides then fizzles out in a sentimental ending. Maybe he's writing for his grandkids now.
B006WQLH7G|5|A good tool for my mobile I would recommend you if you do not decided yet for this kind of app
B0002858YS|1|this album is awful and extremely overrated (but apparently not by me) <br /> <br />\\"Indie Rock N Roll\\" is hilarious.... if only for its poking fun at indie rock as if they are so musically sound that they have a place to do so.  The irony of it is astounding.  However, I like listening to that song at the bar.  But in the sanctity of my own home.... silence, please.
B004XJRQUQ|5|I think this was a great book filled with relationships, intrigue, politics.  Fun for all ages.  Most anyone in the family can enjoy this book.
B008XG1X18|5|love this app. just another way to promote my website in social media. fast loading and great pics to view. love it.
B001AITGWE|5|its an awesome movie. I could see myself going nutso in a whammy burger or something like it..it may not be right but I understand!
B00005JM02|5|Many DVD versions of films seem to include extra features only as a way of justifying a high price without actually providing anything extra you'd want. That is certainly NOT the case with Finding Nemo! Disk 1 contains the widescreen movie and many thoughtful, good quality extra features. Disk 2 contains the pan-and-scan (fullscreen) version of the movie and DIFFERENT extra features than disk 1. The introduction on Disk 1 suggests that after watching the film once, watch it again with the &quot;Visual Commentary&quot; turned on. This includes the usual verbal comments, but also cut-scenes showing how key pieces of animation were done and a &quot;virtual aqauarium&quot;. Finding Nemo is a well-done and innovative DVD that actually justifies having two disks with more than just the film inside. The movie itself is entertaining on repeated viewings for young and old(er) alike. Oh, and that great little short that ran with the movie in the theaters, it's here too!
B00IUBM8PQ|5|Nice movie
B0085YNML2|5|Running on my Kindle fire, this app looks crisp with very bright colors.  The gameplay, like any good casual gamer app, is intuitive and smooth.  There is no lag whatsoever, which makes swinging and grabbing all the hook points that much more fun.  Well done!
006114665X|3|This book is so good in the details that I could just not finish it. I may yet, one day, return to it, but at times it reads like a dry history lesson as opposed to the riveting war it describes. A disappointment.
B00K25GL7Y|3|Great app for totorial on magic the gathering. Unfortunately bug force closing the app, please fix.
B008VZA880|4|I love this movie
0446310786|5|It lived up to all my expectations.  The court room scene is spell binding........just like it was in the movie with Gregory Peck !
B00KG41CZC|5|Still Chuckling.
1400079179|2|Read it to find out what all the hoopla was about. I'm still not sure. The literary equivalent of a pet rock.
B001C08RHA|5|great movie.  I thought with all the superhero stuff it was going to be dumb, but actually a great movie.  Robert Downey Jr. is great as usual playing Tony Stark.  I just bought Iron Man 2 playing it tonight, hope its a good as number 1.
B008EKOIN8|5|I more than loved this book, and I am a huge fan of the writing style and philosophy of Michael Pollan. It's a hugely entertaining read and more importantly, and wonderfully eloquent and practical essay about how real people are reclaiming our food system from big agribusiness. This is not a preachy book, but the ideas here gave me so much hope and creative ideas about how to eat and cook in a more wholesome and environmentally sound way. If you find yourself drifting a little during the first part about BBQ, please push on, you won't be dissappointed.
B000QDA7OU|5|This is a favorite oldie!
B005IQZB14|5|Loved this book. I had a hard time putting it down! I felt so empowered while reading it. A must read!
B005YDLJ76|5|I bought this as a Christmas present for my grandson he loves it.  I believe the only time he doesn't listen to it is when he sleeps
B00A6CCF0K|5|I never expected the sequel to the &#34;Shining&#34; to be this great! I have read it 3 times already! I can't look at an RV anymore without getting the creeps! This book is just plain wonderful! All of Mr. King's fans should have already read this one!
0553284347|5|This is a well written book that I had a hard time putting down.  The author uses actual cases to illustrate her points.  The first half of the book identifies different types of toxic parents and the relationship the children develop with them and why.  The second half of the book goes into how to come to terms with the person your parent(s) is, and how you can work to change your reaction to the way your toxic parents programed your childhood brain.  Highly recommended.
B006LA6IW2|5|Wonderfully written and captivating insight to soldiers lives while at war.<br /><br />Thank you to CHRIS and other soldiers for protecting our country.
B00459EZLW|5|Wow. I am a huge fan of the Stargate series. This is the most adult science fiction series or anything else that I have ever seen. The aliens don't speak English, most are pretty hostile, situation don't end well. Reality sucks, but it sucks 100 x worse on a ship in the middle of no where, and that was depicted extraordinarily well. I love the show. I cannot believe it is over, the worst put together ending of all time. We have so much more to tell in this story. Please for the love of god and all that is holy would someone please get the scratch together and put this crew back on the Destiny already. It has been 3 years this year. Perfect time to bring the show out of stasis. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!
B00KWTZ1RG|5|Product as described, fast shipping
B0064TVQ5E|4|this app is fun! I haven't explored it much, but being able to choose more variety of levels and backgrounds, etc. would be the only suggestion I have here!
B00CEZJT2E|5|Love it and works so great I bought 3 more for each of my kids!
B009K86D86|3|Just ok... didn't really tell us anything everyone shouldn't already have known.  But its a good motivator for everyone to try and eat better and make better choices
B00OY0G2LI|5|Work as intended.
B008K9UZY4|3|ok for a old dated game
B00AKEMHCA|1|Game won't install. This has happened with other faotd from this site.
B00821BLX4|5|As mentioned in other reviews, the little ring that sits around the lens falls out easily. I lost mine somewhere on a week-long bike trip (the camera is perfect for this as I never had to be concerned with moisture). I tried to re-order that piece from Olympus and they were entirely unhelpful. I put a notice in with J&R to email me when this item was in stock. I got the email just before the holidays and pulled the trigger. It fits perfectly and includes a lens cap.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Love the cinematography and settings. An elegant soap opera.  It is a nice break from the usual vulgarity of television.
B0063IH60K|5|Great game to kill time while sitting on the pot or waiting for commercials or while your spouse is talking
0967984602|5|Excellent, affordable, the first steps are important, this is the place to start, put it on Kindle.

0553106635|5|This book by far surpassed my expectations.I knew it would be great and all that,but damn G.R.R.M. plain and simply srewed up my world with the story line.This book was going just the way i suspected and wham....characters who i thought would make it die on me and then the unredemable find salvation.All i have left to say is if you haven`t read this excellent work of fiction,Then do so now.
B002N5N5LG|5|But it gets much better. Still this season has some important backstory and character stuff. When I watched these episodes as the show aired I thought, &#34;Yeah, this is a pretty amusing sitcom.&#34; Nothing super special besides a diverse ensemble cast, but towards the end of this season the show starts taking risks and doing weirder and wackier things. In seasons 2 and 3 it gets exponentially better.
B00BP4X3W2|3|This is a very good movie but it is an older one and I enjoyed it much more the first time I saw it.
B000OZ2CZW|4|Rihanna has finally made a solid album, almost void of her nasal tick of notes and need to have herself above the sound mix. Now with the right production, hello -- echo effect in play during \\"Umbrella\\" (a song Mary J. Blige turned down, yeah, kick yourself hard for that one, girl). Rihanna has dropped the too-sweet Island sun music that she never quite American-ized to have a run away hit and is able to avoid working with Teairra Marie at the food court.<br /><br />With the exception of the horrible slow jams that try to cater to her as if she had a strong voice, Rihanna does well with the sassy jams like \\"Lemme Get That\\" with its call to take every dime a man has on furniture instead of spending her own cash to do so ... why not have him buy the house too then? Even \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" which samples Michael Jackson's chant/call from \\"Wanna Be Startin' somethin'\\" is dipped in a little of reggae while still allowing her to cross over. It's nice to see her growing into her own, even though it is with massive help from studio production.<br /><br />In the past, it seems as if she had been searching for an image, this sassy, sweet vibe suits her well. Even the film-noir album cover works. The only riff: when she fails, she fails hard! Slow jams just aren't her strong note, when its too much of a vocal push for her. Its like telling Ciara to go out there and belt -- not gonna happen. Rihanna has made an excellent summer album that'll stick on the charts for a long time or until Beyonce gets Jealous and tells her to sit down.
B0089EHWQE|5|Hard to put down.  Enjoyed it very much.  It brings out a lot of emotions.
B00B8PMWJI|1|I want all the directors of all the little films in this film arrested and charged with abuse!<br />What a horrible film! The so-called 'directors' should be ashamed of themselves.<br />It's a sick film for sickos.
B00992CF6W|5|The best indie game of 2009-prenest by mojang (notch) Minecraft is going to have a new update soon in the future.<br />I love it.
B00HV2KPNW|5|I highly recommend this movie for the young and old.  Extremly funny and enjoyable.  You will find yourself loving a snowman!
B00BD6KPFU|5|I have been following this series and just when I think I have it all figured out, there is a twist.  Love this series!!  Looking forward to season four starting soon.
B007IXWKUK|4|Good read, very steamy, It moves fast!  You won't be bored with this book.  May even have some tips for you (smile)
B009LH1Y1W|4|I like this series it's funny,sometimes scary and it doesn't treat its viewers like idiots.I love Cass.(he's so adorably clueless).
B005HSG3TC|5|My son got a Kindle Fire for Christmas and did not keep the box or any of the paperwork. His aunt cold not remember if it was HD or not. When you turn it on it does not say. So we order the case for the regular Kindle and it did not fit. I returned it and got this one for the HD and it fits great. He always uses it to sit it up to watch it. It was a very good purchase for the price.
B0043URV8M|1|While I appreciate the very brief homages to John Williams' unforgettable work on the music of Harry Potter, they are not enough to save what is otherwise a completely forgettable score.  At least this time he was no so arrogant as to disregard his predecessor's work completely, as he did for \\"Twilight - New Moon\\".  But I wonder if this was by his own choice or not.  Perhaps Mr. Desplat feels that his work is so exemplary that he can jettison the work of those that came before him, but it is not.  Perhaps Mr. Desplat believes the hype of those enablers who write such glowing reviews for work that is so forgettable, but he should not.  His work on its own smacks of forgettable mediocrity.     Mr. Desplat, remember that when you step into the musical shoes of a saga or franchise that you did not launch, you should respect the fans enough to keep a semblance of continuity for their sake.  Rather than try to reinvent a perfectly good wheel for ego's sake, maybe you should think of the car as a whole.
B002MQYOFW|5|This was by far one of the best books I have ever read! I can't wait to read the next one!

B007QSNNUI|5|I purchased this book for my 17 year old son so he could discover his strengths and decide on a college major and a career.  However, when we received the \\"new\\" book, the online code had already been scratched off and used (there is a 177 question online test that is part of the book).  We had to pay $10 for a new code before he could take the test.  The seller apologized and gave us a $10 refund.  We found the summary of the strengths to be very useful, and the quick remediation of the problem a relief.  I would recommend this book and this seller.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This is a great game. It's basically like Temple Run, but with Minions which make everything more fun! I think everyone should try it. :)
B00J2PFPVI|5|Its a typical Disney movie.with a lot of singing and oh no something crazy happen that we have to fix
B004B32532|2|I love this movie, its a 5 star, but....<br />I'm not sure whats going on with the other reviewers saying this is a great bright and vibrant blu-ray.<br />The one I received was in a clear case not the standard blue case typically used for blu-ray.<br />The one i got is bleached out it looks like a grey screen is over everything.<br />Big artifacts and compression marks at the beginning made me leave the room.<br />The scene of phenix in the white room with the tree shows big screen wide artifacts in the white wall, it looks like the film was cut in half then taped together.<br />Also since I left the room at that point to do something else I continued listening to the dvd and the sound is pretty crummy at points, sounds like distortion is all I can say.<br /><br />It doesn't look as good as my region 2 PAL anchor bay dvd release which has nice bright color.<br />Did I get a defctive disc? whats the problem here?
B00CWY76CC|5|This is a really cool app. I love I t so much because,I like mysteries a lot. I can do one in a minute.get the app!
B0010SKUYM|5|Loved it but it's not finished! Where's the rest!? There must be more somewhere. Delicious.  Don't tease us mr Rothfuss.
B004R36QUE|5|This is the story of King George VI and his attempts to overcome his inability to speak with others in private and in public.  Also having to overcome stammering like King George, I was able to identify with his struggles to come to terms with the influence of a formidable father, but the scale of the problems that King George had to overcome was truly amazing.  I found myself completely admiring the personal courage of an individual who previously had been nothing more than a historical cutout character. This movie brings him to life and gives him a human quality that was, at the risk of cliche, heart warming.<br /><br />This is also the story of King George VI's friendship with his speech therapist, Lionel Logue.  The role was played to perfection by Geoffrey Rush, who manages a perfect blend of irreverent Australian and loyal friend.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000003TAL|3|teenage riot is classic. the rest is not that great.
B003VS0CX8|5|very good movie, effects and content make it worth it in this format, almost like going to the movies, excellent
B00EMXBDMA|5|I'm a silver haired lady who reads quite a lot, and I haven't been so captivated by a character since I read Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings. This astronaut was intelligent, determined, witty, and wry. He came alive from the pages of the book in a way that is quite rare in the world of fiction . I laughed out loud at the comments of this man who was in such peril and physical difficulty, and I found myself really caring about what was happening to him. His courage was inspiring! The other thing I loved about the book was the resourcefulness and creative thinking  of the main character, who figured out how to survive in an impossible environment. Hats off to author Andy Weir for taking us on a journey where science is as fascinating as human ingenuity. Great read!
B007N5YIUS|5|My kids love all the angry birds games,but this is definitely one of their fav ones to play! They play it all the time.
B00003CXA6|5|[[ASIN:B00003CXA6 Gettysburg (Widescreen Edition)]]<br />I first experienced this historical event on Video, it was very moving indeed. Now transferred to DVD, so much more detail seems to be available - including greatly improved sound. Any person with a serious interest in the history of the American Civil War will find this widescreen DVD of great interest. For those with little interest in the history of that time, Gettyburg is a clear reminder of what today the USA stands for - thats freedom.
B007PT3QOQ|5|it gives me something to do when the kids are napping and the housework is done. I like it. my son even plays it sometimes.
B00BAXFCPO|5|I love it
B000002N3J|5|If your a Madonna fan this is a good CD to have.
B009XIXVU6|4|interesting and engaging. was a bit let down at the end after riding along with the different characters and possibilities and turns taken along the way. I kept thinking all the roads would meet somehow at the end for an \\"interesting how events unknown wove together\\" but insteasd the story just .....stopped. but I liked it and would recommend it.
B00EMXBDMA|5|What are great book.  Masterful writing, ingenious plot, suspense, drama, and wonderful, heroic characters. I loved it!  If I ever get stranded on Mars, this is the book I must have with me.
B000002VCT|5|Everyone needs this album to complete the &quot;trilogy&quot; of the first three Project recordings.  If you never buy another Project album after these three, you've done well.  Pyramid simply captures the various aspects  of Pyramids in both a lyrical and musical sense, something you'll find  equally strong in the first two Project albums, Tales of Mystery and  Imagination and I Robot, but sometimes lacking in later works. This album  has one of the best and most subtle Project instrumentals,  Hyper-Gamma-Spaces, which is worth the price of the CD alone.  Dust off  your credit card and go order this.
B000020617|5|This is the best CD that the Foo Fighters have come up with yet. all of the songs have there own way of creeping into your sence of beat and getting the best of you. By this CD. if you don't you will be sorry
B0064MPXFA|5|Great show!
630542845X|5|I will not write a long review of the plot as many before me have done it much better that I could. It is a wonderful movie about the triumph of the human spirit. Sean Patrick Flanery plays the title role of Power with touching sensitivity. I do not know HOW I missed seeing this movie for over 15 years. I remember there was some controversy surrounding this movie during its initial release. I am so glad I finally got around to seeing this gem of a film.
B001FSDOZO|1|Just when you think Nickelback can't get any worse, they release yet another album full of musical diarrhea.  A lousy combination of mindless raunchy lyrics and zero musical talent.  Nickelback are the founding fathers of a new genre of rock: \\"Trailer Park Rock.\\"  Others in this genre include Theory of a Deadman, Puddle of Mudd, etc.
B009HUB40Y|5|really fun game; super glad I found it; also you cant beat the price FREE. Hope some of my fb friends join in
B000IY06CK|5|Julia Fischer is one of the finest violinists around, and this recording is one of the best of Tchiakovsky's popular Violin Concerto. Ms. Fischer plays with great fire, equally from emotion as well as from intellect, while most others are capable of only the former. To her, this music is worth doing as well as it can be, which means emphasizing the archetecture of the concerto and the relationship of the three other pieces on this disc to it. Ms Fischer plays the complete, uncut concerto with all the repeats in the first and third movements intact, which displays the formal balance of the work. Other violinists cut these repeats, which seems to say they merely want to barnstorm through the piece, placing emphasis on themselves. This is frankly what Heifetz and many others do, not taking the piece seriously as the interesting work it is. By the way, most of Ms Fischer's other recordings are of an equally high value, such as her recording of the Brahms \\"Double\\", also with Mr Kreitzberg and the Russian National Orchestra.         For many years before I had heard this disc, however, this work was just a fashionable warhorse I never listened to anymore. I used to own the Heifetz/Reiner, but I got tired of it and of the music itself. Gradually, though, I wondered if there might be a better way to play the piece which presented it as music rather than emphasizing it as a collection of tawdry tunes you've heard a million times.  The wind parts seemed important for their timbre, for example, but it seemed no one focused on them. No one, that is, until I heard this recording, the reviews of which seemed to describe a performance of exactly the sort I wanted.  Think of Mravinsky's classic accounts of Symphonies 4,5,6 with the old Lenningrad Phil on DG with their lean textures and attention to detail. But, you also had to bring out the winds. That is part of the accomplishment of Yakov Kreitzberg, a conductor I'd never heard of, but who was obviously one of the most outstanding young conductors of his generation. (I say \\"was\\" because tragically, Mr. Kreitzberg left us in March of 2011. What a loss to music!)  Here, this Russian-American master leads his excellent Russian orchestra with great skill and aplomb, presenting this music in a completely convincing way. This is the performance I'd hoped for, because it lets the music speak for itself, and it speaks very eloquently with no need of any exaggeration. We shouldn't forget that Tchiakovsky's favorite was Mozart.               The three companion pieces on this disc are all just as well played in performances which  simply present them as interesting in themselves as well as for their connection to the concerto. This is particularly true of the last of the three, the lesser-known \\"Souvenir,\\" which begins with what is apparently the original slow movement of the concerto, and which is very well played by Mr Kreitzberg's piano accompaniment of Ms Fischer's beautifully played part. All of these brief works are more than just fillers, and they're all played as well and as interestingly as the concerto.          Finally, the SACD sound is a great plus, and it increases the listener's enjoyment and understanding of music that should be taken much more seriously than as just virtuoso fodder, and Ms Fischer and Yakov Kreitzberg must be congratulated for accomplishing this. This is the recording to live with.

B009CVRQLY|4|After an long wait Celine finally releases an new CD since 2007's Taking Chances disc. I'm giving the album 4 out of 5 stars because I don't care for the 2 duets on the disc. The 1st one with Ne-Yo and the 2nd with Stevie Wonder. They do nothing for me. Sorry. Also I could have done without the alien machine aka the reverb/ vocal dubbing on many of the new tracks. I guess Celine wants to stay current with the 18 to 30 age group. I can understand that to an point. On the positive side I enjoyed the songs: Water and a Flame, Unfinished Songs, and At Seventeen. I was really hoping Celine was going to go back to her earlier English language albums with this release. Guess not. I was hoping the experimenting would have ended with the Taking Chances sessions. Don't get me wrong I like some of the songs on the T C album but its more misses then hits for me. Also wasn't this album originally suppose to be an double CD with new material and a 2nd disc with songs from the new Vegas show? I guess Sony/Columbia didn't want to spend the extra cash on an double album.<br /><br />Bottom line I know its Celine's album and she can choose the songs she wants to record and how she wants to record them I would prefer 90's Celine that's all. I wish she would record another Let's Talk about Love, Falling Into You, or Celine Dion type CD more ballads main stream pop and her natural voice. The booklet is very well done. Dion still looks stunning in the album booklet.
B004HO6I2E|5|\\"Growing up we both had dreams. Dave wanted to be an astronaut, I wanted to sell dolphins on the black market. But found thats hard to do. We live in Atlanta... dolphins are hard to find...\\"  When single Mitch (Reynolds) and married with children Dave (Bateman) go out they begin talking about each others lives.  Both feel like the other one has a better life, then they take a pee.  When they wake up the fun begins.  Going in I was hoping for a few laughs, mainly because I think the two actors are hilarious.  The first half hour was hard to watch, because I was laughing so hard my side hurt and I was crying.  Not since \\"Wedding Crashers\\" was I blown away by the comedy that I was not expecting.  By that I mean not only the extreme shocking moments, but the timing between the two and the dialog was so funny that I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that it started off on a full run but turned a little more sappy at the end.  On the flip side, that part balanced out the rest of it just enough to give your cheeks and side a break.  This is a definate R rated comedy that men and women will both love.  That is hard to do.  I loved it a lot.  Overall, next to \\"Hall Pass\\" the funniest movie I have seen since \\"Wedding Crashers\\".  This movie will not disappoint. I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Absolutely.  I want to buy this.<br /><br />*Also try - Hall Pass & Wedding Crashers
B004SBQGHS|3|This seems to be something for young people. I bought it because I had heard so much talk of it. My Kindle was new and I didn't know how to order so I bought it twice by accident.
0385738781|5|good author.
B00AHSIQWE|5|must see, can a bad thing about the dark knight. will watch it again in the future. to bad Christian Bale didn't do the other movies.
B005BY3XHC|4|Easy to read and understand, definitely with a really good things to take and practice in your life every single day!! ;)
B008Y2FRFO|5|I love this game so much and it doesn't cost any money. What not to love. I just can't figure out how to play frog toss.
B000P0J0D8|5|I love this movie, and I always want to show it to new friends but can never find it in a video store.  The price was right, so I bought it and can watch it whenever I want now.  Joy!
B00338QENI|5|This was such a great story and I couldnt put it down. I never knew where hela came from. I had heard of it but now I know. Parts of the book were very technical and got slightly boring but the story of her and how her family never knew that her cells were the reason we have cures and other things was so interesting. What a shame they couldnt have helped her to survive. This is a must read.
B000FCKC4C|5|the second time to read this and I loved it all over again...wonderful guide lines for a full life..in story setting that brings it all together
B00005OM4N|5|Britney has delivered a fantastic album. There are a lot of different styles and sounds on it, but Britney's voice pulls it all together. The CD contains R&amp;B influenced songs, like Slave, Boys and Lonely, but there are also really good pop songs, like Cinderella, Overprotected and Anticipating. And of course there is this beautiful ballad Not A Girl. I just saw the video, and let me tell ya, it's amazing. Here in Europe, we have one extra song. It's a fantastic ballad called When I Found You. Britney wrote 5 songs on the album, and she has proven that she's more than just a pretty girl.
B0090P98Z4|5|i like it!!!!! :)
B0099RFVXQ|4|I like this film for those nights when I as tired and just want to kick back and be entertained.  I did not grow up with the printed Marvel comics so each time I view on the film I get another connection of layer of the teams connections.
B004SIIBGU|5|Not as big into eBay as i used to be but it works like a charm hands down.  I probably should get on there more often...oh where does the time go lol
B003Q6D1YW|5|Ok I read a lot of negative reviews, however, I still purchased the catfish for my 14 by 4 foot round above ground pool \\"Intex\\".  It is great!!!,  I see that this may not be a great idea for a a BIG IN GROUND POOL.  After all you paid more $$ for the inground pool so You must pay more $$ to clean it!!!  That is all I have to say for those that complained about it.
B004AO4FJ4|5|Great show I love this doctor I'm hooked after this season.  I wanna see rose more Lol she is gorgeous
B00IYAG7DM|5|This isn't my usual type of game, but I enjoy it. Has kept me entertained for a while now. I am giving it a 5 star rating due to ease of use and entertainment value
B009UX2YAC|5|This game isn't hard at all. Also it was  very interesting and you can get<br />A lot of things if you try this game is so cool because it's very easy .
0307266303|5|This extraordinarily well written book is about running, but it isn't.  It's about eating, but it isn't.  It's about good health, but it isn't.  And it's about love and friendship.  It is not about telling you what you should do or eat or believe.    I have read it twice and I NEVER read books twice, at least, not in the same decade.  I may read it again, too.  Got it for my 40-something-year-old daughter and now, she's reading it, and I know she'll pass it along to her friends.
B006GWO5NE|5|Charges just fine.
B00CWY76CC|5|I absolutely love playing this game. So much fun.<br />When or if I get stuck figuring something out my family is right there to jump in to take over. I have a time getting it back.lol
B00DPM7TIG|5|Delightful read.. I looked forward to picking the book up again each time
B00K4APIN0|3|Adding &#34;Clash of&#34; to the game's name doesn't make it as good as Clash of Clans.  It's OK but it's not an absolute winner.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Hard to play but really fun!!  As good as flappy.Bird the original!  Give it a try.  You'll like it very much.
B001S86J2Q|5|ES MUY BUENA,YA QUE ES UN CLASICO DEL CINE,LA RECOMIENDO PARA LOS QUE LES GUSTE UN BUEN MUSICAL
B0095ZMMCK|5|As is his wont lately, our dear friend Clancy is painstakingly slow in his build, nearly taking us two thirds of the way through the book before you reach \\"I can't lay it down,\\" status. But, oh my, after that, hold on!<br /><br />A terrifying forecast of an improbable yet possible future low level but intense conflict with the Peoples Republic of China. The end will leave you like Lionel Hampton did in Crazy Hamp . . . with your foot poised in the air.  What happens now? This is not an anti-Sino work, only one that explores the balances in Asia.
B00BB8RKH6|3|Denzel landing the plane is worth seeing the whole movie for!  Later scenes are a little preachy for me, but Denzel's performance is excellent, as always. Plus John Goodman shows once again why he is a national treasure.
B004J4WKUQ|5|Interesting and well written. In the beginning the world is portrayed as a bleak and dreary place. The virtual world holds a good and promising escape. The first person narrative offers you a glimpse into the heroes mind and heart. At times I was amazed and at others the technology made sense and was very captivating.
B00COHAUD4|4|Gave me goosebumps, a minimum requirement for &#34;scary&#34;. The &#34;scary&#34; movies I usually watch don't meet this standard. Watch it and see.
B000KUD2G4|5|I use the Hum Destroyer throughout my recording system, to eliminate all RF as well as hum between electronic devices.  Behringer's HD is half the price of others and works perfectly.  Why spend more?  Delivery was perfect.  100% satisfied.
1573229725|5|Top notch writing from an author that couldn't possibly outdo her previous novel \\"Tipping the Velvet\\", but she DID!! Just shut up and get this book!!!
014028009X|5|I kept on resisting reading this book but when I knew the movie was coming I gave in if only to be able to say I'd read it before seeing the movie.  I was pleasently surprised.  This book is realistic and it addresses a lot of the neurosis that we all suffer from each and every day.  Bridget has one hell of a year in this book, but it and read it and see how much of you is in this book.
B00IOVH8AW|5|Makes me happy.
B008GJVH7M|4|This is a favorite of mine from the early Coen brothers movies. The complex motivations of the character s pays off in the action. You are rewarded for multiple viewings of the movie.
B005JABSB6|5|They are surprisingly comfortable to wear even over my regular glasses. I'm not sure if it was these glasses or my new Sharp TV but the 3D was much better than I had expected. Sometimes at the movie theater 3 D movies can be slightly out of focus but my experience was much better than i expected. The picture was astonishingly sharp and brilliant and exactly in focus!
B009AYVNEY|5|Honestly, I didn't know that this movie would be so dark when I started watching it. I hadn't read anything about it or watched the trailer. It simply came up as suggested; though, looking at the cover art now, I could have seen that coming. Speaking of, from the very first few minutes you get the sense of a malevolent undercurrent. Scenes of joy and revelry mixed with sounds and sights of implied tragedy and violence. I was hooked right from the beginning. As the movie progresses, you see life as it presently is for a woman who's lost everything and is shunned by her community; bits of flashbacks, like bad memories and haunting dreams tell the backstory of how this came to pass. The most intriguing part of the story is not the culmination of events towards the inevitable, but the depth of the characters and their broken relationships with each other. This is not a feel good movie and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Be prepared for a painful and heartbreaking unraveling of one woman's family and the rest of her life.
B000005RTQ|5|The price of this product this one good bad the sending cost for is Brazil that was expensive.<br />You have to lower this value.
B006VFLIYK|5|Excellent reading. I have read a number of David Baldacci's books and he captivates you. I highly recommend this book and this author.
B00DR0PDNE|3|still cant do what I wanted
B0054JZC6E|5|this made my day because it has many games and u can get points and by new games the. games. are fun and amusing.
B003XVYLDU|5|I gave this book, a five star rating just on the caliber of the story itself.  Vonnegut is at his best!
044024238X|5|A great light read.  I normally hate reading, but I devoured this book!  Maybe it's because I'm a lawyer at a big firm like the lead character in this book, so I found it particularly funny for that reason.  I think anyone would enjoy it though!
0553106635|5|Finally, a fantasy author that can write mesmerisingly well for 3 novels in a row. Keep up the good work, Mr Martin.
B00QUSV9MY|5|One of the best concerts I have ever viewed.  I would have really liked to have been there but the disc allows for the interruptions for costume changes and such to be cut out.
B00009TB5G|5|The number of extras in this DVD in really stunning. They cover every aspect of the production from Gollum to settings to warriors of middle-earth. i bought this DVD as a natural and instinctive step on my way to complete my Tolkien collection. However I must say that the long string of adjectives in the DVD title is well-earned. Right from the packaging there is a sense of exclusivity that makes this a really good experience.<br />I also like the the extra scenes, and i wish they had put the faramir scenes in the movie to show the hidden virtue of his character. Some scenes don't really fit into the mood of the film, so i can understand why they were cut, but Peter Jackson's conceptualization of Middle-Earth is so stunning that i don't even mind.
B0027MJU00|3|I lover her creativity.  She is a new favorite author.
B0055SWM08|5|Well built and plenty of fun. The levels are crafty and the game works well. It is a great game to take up time with.
B007L96VCY|5|This remaster is assume. The extra material if real nice.  Has to be my favorite Paul album...no question at all...
B00AB7HESI|3|Great puzzle game. Time consuming in a very good way
B00CSGYLQI|3|I just wanted to post here to help all the adults that will endure the assembly this holiday season.  I went to You Tube to see if I could find someone actually assembling it because the instructions are not helpful with the castle, they are somewhat helpful with the ice palace.  It's a weird toy and the price fluctuation is rather shocking.  I paid $110, I've heard people buying it at Walmart for $65 and have seen it as much as $230 on Amazon.  It's just a plastic frame for kids to play with the furniture provided in front of it.  Very little play happens inside of it.  That said, my almost 5-year old daughter was very excited to get it and I guess it's the new doll house.  A doll house is waay cooler in my opinion.  Ok, here's the deal with the assembly, look at the box photos for the castle assembly, that's all you really need.  Build the ice palace from the bottom up and follow the letters on the instructions or you'll get stuck.  There's paper wall decorations that have little plastic push pins and there's a few pieces I still don't know what they are.  Anyway, good luck everyone, you'll need it!
B009NW9QE2|5|fun movie
B00947N6D8|5|This's a wonderful story for kids and adults alike.  If you enjoy taking the fantastical and folk stories and making them into fully fleshed characters, for example like Neil Gaiman's Sandman, then this'll be right up your alley.
B00DUGCLY4|5|in this game you use all of your brain so it make you feel smart. I love this game because it is really cool
B0000042H4|4|I feel that the tempo, casting and general style of Solti's Ring is great. The performances and the quality of recording are of a particularly high standard. Of course there is Nilsson but I think Gerhard Stolz is great, as Mime, as Aegithus in Solti's 'Elektra', as Herod in Solti's 'Salome'. He always plays the revolting characters with great drammatic effect.<br /><br />For me the first act of Siegfried embodies all that is great in Solti's Ring Cycle, appropriately paced with the drammatic tension created by the discourse between Siegfried and Mime keeping you totally hooked.<br /><br />Solti's Ring also has problems. When it comes to the big scores such as 'Ride of the Walkyries', 'Siegfried's Funeral March' (in particular) and the finale to Twilight of the Gods, Solti's bombastic style can be quite irritating.<br />He seems to have a habit of placing undue emphasis on the brass which has the effect of drowning out the strings. Such pieces are played too loudly and lack subtlety. 'Siegfried's funeral march' for me is particularly disappointing. Indeed I have noticed a trend in many of Solti's works to drown out the strings; 'Salome' and 'Elektra' for example. The orchestral emphasis (in particular on brass)in these recordings serves to make it difficult to discern the lyrics.<br /><br />So, in some respects I think this is a brilliant recording but for the big scores Solti completely messes up. Whilst I have not heard any other of the 'classic' recordings I would imagine Bohm's rendition is worth its salt if his 'Tristan und Isolde' is anything to go by. I feel that Bohm produces a better orchestral balance than Solti on the whole.
B00BD99JMW|4|Certainly Divergent was the best of the three but when you start the series, you must complete it. A lot of Allegiant was waiting to see what would happen. At least ending was not predictable.
B00003CXRM|5|The music alone is worth getting this movie.  The casting is terrific from George Clooney  to the guy that plays Baby Face Nelson.  A really fun movie
B00DJFIMW6|5|Great for keeping the littles busy. I wish there was a way to actually win the game. My kids have much fun with this game.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This whole thing is slicker than snot on a glass doorknob. The way it connects is great and I'm lucky I have a usb jack on the back of my tv to power this as well. Once I put it on my wireless network it has been super easy to watch YouTube, Amazon prime, Netflix, we even watch episodes of tv shows from the network websites (although not Chromecast enabled it still works OK). I wish my basement tv had more hdmi inputs so I could get one down there as well...
0679409866|4|I first read Jane Austen as a freshman in college, reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE in one fabulous day, a singular feat for me.  I can only add my voice to those praising her works, which are deceptively unpretentious and  straighforward.  This one, late in her career, is a bit complicated at  first with a myriad of relatives and relationships.  But at its core it is  a mature portrait of social pressures on women, focused on an intelligent  and wise and loving woman who finds a man equal to her.  It is not merely a  good story, not merely proto-feminist, not merely a satire... it is all of  those, and a lovely read.
B000YMM3CC|4|All met expectations.
B0076R6MES|5|Rowan Atkinson never fail to entertain!  Though I loved the first Johnny English more, this one was funny and interesting too.  I think in this movie they tried to tone down the character too much to sort of make him normal.  The first Johnny English was more Mr Beanish, this one was less so.  Anyhow, it was interesting and I highly recommend it!
B0057VDGNK|3|The first 4 songs are really great<br />The others are essentially the same type of rythm, under marginally different musical arrangements, hence not very good value for the money
B0082RHRHC|4|I can see why this book is a classic.  In reading this tale as a young adult, I more enjoyed the twists and turns with coincidental connections; this time reading, I enjoyed the turn of phrase, interesting adjectives and dialogue.

B000002H98|4|Review no. 1195. Don't believe I've ever covered a disc on Amazon with THIS many other reviews. I don't CARE what any other old school Metallica fans, followers, die-hards, etc. think about this CD. I've always liked it from day one. Tracks I just might never grow tired of hearing are \\"Sad But True\\", \\"The Unforgiven\\", the power-house rocker \\"Wherever I Shall Roam\\", \\"Of Wolf And Man\\" and \\"The Struggle Within\\". As many of times as I've listened to this disc, I never once felt it was all THAT commercial. Maybe a little, but still good enough to appeal to fans from the beginning. I start listening to Metallica right after the release of 'Ride The Lightning'. Obviously recommended.
B00FAX6XQC|5|It's awesome I love this game you can upgrade things and don't have to buy coins. It's just like arcade.game but on the kindle.
B000002LEE|5|This is by far Jane's best work yet. Although Ritual de lo Habitual may  slightly edge out this album musically, it is really too close to call. The  one element that makes this album supreme is the lyrical and emotional  content. Perry Farrell is at his absolute best content-wise and in his  delivery of these incredible songs. The varying grooves on this album keep  you guessing, which is what Perry does best. As for the instrumentals, they  are absolutely soaring. The music literally takes you into another world  atmospherically. Jane does this like no other band...ever. As for Dave  Navarro, what can I say? He is simply the best around. Nothing's Shocking  is Jane's best work.
B001F7MSG6|5|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />There's also loads of extras in this particular edition of the movie -- feature commentary with director Guillermo Del Toro, Jeffrey Tambor, Selma Blair and Luke Goss, as well as some deleted scenes also with commentary with Del Toro, a prologue to the movie, a digital script, image gallery, a \\"Puppet Theatre\\" for the opening sequences of the film, concept art, interviews, and other such stuff. Also making-of documentaries -- seven mini-documentaries that visit the set, the \\"Troll Market Tour\\" in the movie's most memorable \\"faerie\\" setting, and the two-hour \\"Hellboy: In Service Of The Demon.\\"<br /><br />As if that wasn't dizzying enough, the blu-ray edition has a bunch of EXTRA extra stuff, namely a bunch of interactive features -- backstories of the characters, a create-your-own-Hellboy-comic thingy, Director's Notebook, footage from the movie \\"Wanted,\\" CGI rendering backstory, and loads more. I get tired just thinking about it.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store.

B000002LAC|5|These three woman together are fantastic.  Their harmony is wonderful. I purchased both Trio albums and am enjoying them very much. They are so good together.
0843175621|5|My daughter loves this book. Perfect size for a preschooler's hands. She also really enjoys the story. She first saw it on YouTube (the cartoon version from the 1970s) and is excited to also have the book.
B0009I7NNA|1|HA HA HA  M. shadows can't scream anymore hahahaa man he sounds sooo bad doing jus clean vocals. jesus does he suck. <br /> <br />anyways moving on, this band can totally copies 80's hair metal style riffs with a large dose of today's metal core. this is a band that would even make Vince Neal cringe. <br /> <br />the music now is soo cheesy sounding and crappy that i would rather headbang to my phones ringtones. i totally think that M. shadows not being able to scream anymore hindered this bands sound therefore making it ten times more cheesier. <br /> <br />there are some points where there's little cool double guitars dueling, but if u want to listen to that, jus listen to the masters who originated it, IRON MAIDEN. <br /> <br />these guys claim they were inlfuence by bands such as Metallica but im sorry dudes u are not even as brutal as Metallica....ouch <br /> <br />dont buy this jus because its a trend to listen to these guys, if you already havnt done so, get their old stuff
B00FAPF5U0|4|Before level  300, everything is very fun. But after level three hundred, It's all about luck. If you don't have many boosters, you will not pass the level. I'm guessing they just want you to buy. But, overall this game is very fun to play. I played to level 323, without any purchases.
B0015ABRE2|5|The horrible and hysterical exploits of Dexter Morgan, All-American serial killer, continue into a third year. You'd think that with Sgt. Doakes out of the picture, life would be a piece of cake. Think again. An unplanned detour from Harry's code, home life's getting a bit too intense, and an unwelcome new best buddy appears who threatens to screw up Dexter's carefully constructed facade. Equally adept with his wit and his meat cleaver, our hero delivers the goods.
B009WO7NQO|5|I'm definitely addicted! I love the lightsabers and use of the Force, so clever. I have already recommend this version to a couple others who also enjoy it. Can't wait for more levels!
B00DYOOGYK|5|Awesome scenery and hot girls in a casino and you have to get throw the first 2 levels then you have a lot of fun....HAVE FUN
B005OCHOZS|1|I don't know why this is in my box...never ordered this so I am replying to get this off my list.  Thank you.
B00CDY6HW6|4|I've only played a couple levels of this game, but so far I like it. It reminds me of the old PC game Lemmings. Nice easy levels at the beginning with instructions on what each icon does.
B00ET9T2WK|5|Awesome<br />And very straight like game
B001NEK2GE|5|My son's birthday present. He loves it! It does everything he expected and wanted! He didn't stop talking about it for two weeks, lol. Uses it daily, hooks up to all his devises, including his DJ controller. Works beautiful, he loves all the options, and how easy it is to tweek it.
B0064MPXFA|5|Very good!
B009U9S6FI|5|I highly recommend this book to anyone feeling lost, depressed, or worthless. I was struggling to find the meaning of my life, and after reading this book, it is now very clear to me. Please, do not hesitate to read this book. It is life-changing.
B008XG1X18|5|I find Pinterest to be very relaxing. If I'm in sad mood or a cranky mood, I can rely on Pinterest to get me out of that funk. I love creating new boards and being able to name them myself. I try and come up with unique titles. I appreciate other people's boards and depending on how I feel at the time, I search for a variety of subjects. I like the fact that I have the option to follow a person or just one or two of his or her board. I also enjoy the fact that each pin can bring me to the site it was pinned from.
B009IEXKXI|4|I found it difficult to put down, the book is written so well I felt as though I were on Mars with him!
B00006AW2O|5|I bought this album brand new,in mono,  in 1964 when I was 12. Like another reviewer, Russell Scott, I played it until the grooves wore out. I used to lay in the dark, on the floor of my bedroom, with my ear against the speaker of my father's portable Emerson, and I memorized every lick, every pause and every breath of this amazing and astounding album. Over the years, I've purchased several replacements, including the phoney-baloney &quot;stereo&quot; vinyl and one CD. Now, all these years later it appears on the market as an SACD (whatever THAT is - or hopes to be) and asks me to buy it AGAIN.<br />Well, I'm happy to report that I have and that it was WORTH EVERY PENNY! Somebody finally found the work tapes and mixed REAL STEREO to 6 of the tracks - and what a revelation they are! Around and Around, Confessin' the Blues (which features, IMO, the best vocal of Jagger's career), the exquisite and sublime, but annoying MESS of Empty Heart, It's All Over Now, 2120 South Michigan (with an extended surprise), and If You Need Me are presented the way they SHOULD have been 38 years ago.<br />Only (the single version of) Time Is On My Side, Good Times,Bad Times, Under The Boardwalk, Congratulations (which has always been a favorite of more people I've known than I can count, and is still spelled wrong on the cover), Grown Up Wrong and Suzie Q are in mono.<br />I can't help but wonder why, if these tracks are available in stereo NOW,  weren't they originally? Why was London Records compelled to LIE about it with their &quot;Electronically Rechannelled&quot; garbage?<br />I suppose I should count my blessings and be happy with 6 out of 12, but I can't help being suspicious that in another 38 years the others will surface &quot;after an exhaustive search&quot;, of course, and I'll be too DEAD to care.<br />Only a big handful of British Invasion albums really MATTERED to me and &quot;12X5&quot; has always been, and will ever be, NUMBER ONE. <BR>I offer a 'thank you', in smallcase, to those who were responsible for this release. Better late than never, I guess.
B008Y2FRFO|5|coin dozer is fun but when you run out coins you haft to whait till you get more coins to keep playing.
B000002UAX|5|If there was ever a rock album that was a reflection of its time, it DEFINITELY was 'The Beatles' ('The White Album'). 1968 has been variously described as the year that came the closest this country ever came to an internal civil war -- the Vietnam War was reaching a peak of conflict, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, the violence and chaos in Czechoslovakia, the demonstrations and protests at the Chicago Democratic Convention that year.   <br /> <br />Somehow, through its mess of stylistic range and gripping songwriting, 'The White Album' reflected it all.  The Beatles were coming apart at the seams during the recording process of this album, but in their usual brilliant way, they gave a perfect encapsulation of the times.  A previous reviewer here said there was a sense of terror about this album, and I would agree -- songs like \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (in my opinion, the best song on the album), \\"Sexy Sadie\\", \\"Julia\\" (a lament for John Lennon's mother), \\"Mother Natures Son\\" and \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" are totally haunting and remain enraptured in your mind after one or two listenings.  The album also contains what is unquestionably the hardest rock the band ever recorded in the form of \\"Yer Blues\\", \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\\" and (especially) \\"Helter Skelter\\".  In a strange sense, the album as a whole also seems to be a kiss-off or farewell to the utopian spirit and promise that the 1960's held, and was alive only one year earlier with the \\"Summer of Love\\" and 'Sgt. Pepper's'.  Many people criticize \\"Revolution No. 9\\" for being an unlistenable avant-garde experience, and it may very well be, but for those who lived through 1968, doesn't it seem like its wierdness and bizarre construction reflected the turmoil of the events that surrounded the world at that time ? <br /> <br />If you are expecting a perfectly constructed Beatles album like 'Rubber Soul' or 'Revolver', you will be surprised or shocked at how different this album is from every other Beatles recording.  But it is no less a masterpiece that few (if any) bands would attempt, and if several filler tracks like \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road ?\\" keep this from being considered rock's best double album ever, there is also no album or double album that, taken in one listening, will raise a host of emotions in you as 'The White Album' can.
B00CWY76CC|5|great game<br /><br />needs more levels but love it<br />i want to play more it get addictive everybody in the family loves it we all help eachother
B00ESY6TKY|5|Just the name says it all.  Okay Hollywood, you put all minds into this one.  A must see.  The artistry as well as the wardrobe is breathtaking.  Makes you want to visit both of the mansions in this movie.  I have watched it several times because it is powerfully presented.  The director and actors all worked as a team.  Well done!  A must buy!
B005NFW0U0|5|Keeps getting better Nd better! This series has me watching it over again! I dnt usually write ratings, but its thaat good!
B00AREIAI8|4|i was doubtful at first. i love horses to death, though, so I though I would try it out. i do not regret it. this game features BREATHTAKING graphics and great help. gives you plenty to do and keeps you buisy. you are never bored playing this game. that, I respect.
B00H4M3GXK|5|Wonderful movie
B000I8G5B2|5|I have always loved this movie
B0054JZC6E|4|this app is really fun, but for some of the games the controls are hard to understand/do. Also the game always has ads popping up. I just got the game and I've hit about 4 ads on accidebt already.
B00AA7O6QC|5|good old action pack movie with all my favorite action heroes from the 80's and begining of 90's.. is funny and non ending action.
B00006CXXU|5|Christina is the MOST talented singer I have EVER heard. Yes, even better than Mariah. She's got a clear, smooth, flawless voice. I knew when she first came out, she was 1,000,000 times more talented than Britney but I don't think she got the recognition she deserved. .... Christina is REAL! She's the COMPLETE package of looks AND talent. Her voice gives me chills everytime I hear it. Each song is a masterpiece. I cry every time I listen to \\"I'm OK\\". She really bared her soul on this album. I do believe she has a VERY LONG LASTING career ahead of her. ...
B004GWV1CY|1|Terrible plot totally predictable.  Girlfriend made me watch it with her. Barely sat through it it was so bad. White noise movie
B005IQZB14|5|Loved this book - such a well written story
B00CVCG87O|5|Keeps me coming back for more, can easily just sit and listen to the whole thing. Composed, articulate, strong, yet emotional cleans throughout. Brilliant rhythms. Has become my go-to for introducing friends to heavy music. This album really adds something special to anyone's library, love the saxophone and instrumentals.
B000002J5K|5|I really liked the Blues Brothers CD. It was well done. It came in  a short period of time. The only bad side about the CD is that it doesn't include the music that was being played when they introduced the Blues Brothers at the Palace Hotel Ballroom.
B006Y5EDRG|5|The acting was really wonderful.  I loved the music and overall it was the best TV series I have ever seen.  Get both seasons.  You won't regret it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5|this game is beautyful :-)  nice work<br />way batter than diamond dash they should put this on Facebook<br />5<br />stars
B00KDKM58C|5|Good music.  We saw the show in Vegas, and loved it.
B007SYWFRM|4|I just love this game, but on my Kindle Fire HD, it keeps freezing up and shutting down on me. Other than that, no issues and I would've given it 5 stars.
B002M2N9JI|4|I want something different from the usual of what I been listening to.After years of male rocking, I want to hear something from the ladies.  I choose this because of the cover. And surprisingly its a good album.<br />Of all ten albums i purchase, this is one of my favourite.<br /><br />her next album should be the most antcipated album by one of new talented young singer.
B00H2EQFBK|5|Great series!!!
B00KWVZ750|5|What are you waiting for? Play this at once!
B00D7Z4GQY|5|This book was well written and the story had unexpected twists and turns.  The characters were interesting and it was hard to put the book down.
B004Q7CIFI|1|Obviously been bumped up in the star ratings, not that good, not bad either. just very slow going, you'll nor finish iT very quickly pun intended.
B008Y7N7JW|4|I had heard that this was a great movie and I was not disappointed. I have not yet read the book so I am not sure how it compares, but now I am looking forward to diving into the novels as well! We watched this one night for Family Fun Night and everyone really enjoyed it. It is a well told tale and the acting and visuals keep you involved in the story. It definitely has that Big Brother Is Watching You feel.
B00O7UED2A|4|You are trying to find various codes to go from room to room breaking a bank. The concept is very similar to other escape games. Look for numbers, patterns, and objects that will help you solve puzzles. This app, however, is a bit better since there is also a story line that is well thought out. The puzzles are not too hard for a beginner, but will keep regular players interested, too. However, the more familiar you are with this genre, the less you may be able to enjoy. Unless I missed something, there are only 15 levels. They only last around 4 hours or so. For 99 cents, it is a worthwhile purchase, but I took off a point for the game length. Once you really get into it, it seems to be over.
B000H4TX9I|5|I watch the entire series at least once a year. Outstanding. One of a kind.
B0054JZC6E|5|absolutely amazing app. its sooo much fun and I absolutely. love it. there is so many games and they are all great.
0375507256|5|So you've probably already read about how David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\" has a unique structure of six mostly independent stories arranged like an onion; that is, the first and last chapters comprise the first narrative, the second and second-to-last comprise the second narrative, and so on.  I mostly approve of this device, and it is somewhat compelling when each narrative makes an appearance in its successor -- e.g. the first chapter is the first half of a journal, which is found by a character in the second chapter, and so on through to the sixth story.  Occasionally I thought \\"He is trying too hard to tie the stories together\\", but generally the device serves to enhance the excitement of each story, as each one is interrupted at a cliffhanger point to enter the next layer of the onion.<br /><br />The stories are tied together in another way as well: they all examine how man exerts his power over other men.  This ranges from the large scale (wide-scale extermination) to small (the imprisonment of a single person).  This theme is presented quite effectively, I think, although there are a few unsubtle points where characters stop in the middle of the story to hold forth on will-to-power and the inherent savagery of mankind.  Mitchell also baldly presents a negative view of corporations and capitalism that is rather more pessimistic than mine.  Aside from these bits of authorial pontificating, the writing is very enjoyable and the repetition over the main theme does lead the reader towards some profound thinking about society's power relationships.<br /><br />Each story is not only written in a different location and time period, but also with a different voice and using different language.  I thought it was pretty cool that the two narratives set in the future used new slang words.  The inventiveness of the plots and the confidence with which the author inhabits different personalities are striking.  All in all, it's a crackerjack of a book, enjoyable at both the thriller level and as an examination of the innate cruelty in men's hearts.he thriller level and as an examination of the innate cruelty in men's hearts.

B00A9ET4MC|5|Like practically everyone I know, I’m uncomfortable talking about race. Given the unsteady dynamics of relations between Jews and African-Americans, the subject has been particularly fraught with tension for me. From the time in eighth grade when I was ridiculed for befriending a black classmate, to my years in grassroots politics when I sometimes found myself the only white person in the room (and faced open suspicion and even hostility from some), race has always been a difficult topic for me. I think it’s that way for nearly all Americans, or at least all white Americans (and especially for those who claim to be “color blind”).<br /><br />Perhaps the American obsession with race can only be viewed dispassionately by an African for whom the topic is entirely new and strange. In Americanah, the brilliant young Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie brings the topic to the fore, subjecting it to merciless and sometimes hilarious scrutiny both in her portrayal of the relationships among her characters and in freewheeling commentaries on race posing as blog posts scattered throughout the book.<br /><br />Following up her extraordinary novel about the Biafran war of independence, Half of a Yellow Sun (reviewed here), with an even more personal story, Adichie tells the story of Ifemelu, a young Nigerian who emigrates to the United States to complete her education and returns to Nigeria thirteen years later. Americanah — the word appears to be Nigerian slang for a person like Ifemelu who returns home with American habits and expectations — is, above all, a love story. The focus throughout is on her relationships with men — from her high school sweetheart to the “rich white hunk” to the African-American professor. I don’t know whether Ifemelu is the author’s alter ego. But given her intelligence, her Nigerian education, and her family’s intellectual heritage, she might as well be.<br /><br />Americanah is the story of an African immigrant, but in a broader sense it stands for the experience of millions of Asian, Latin American, and Eastern European immigrants as well — just the latest installment in America’s centuries-long history as a refuge not just for the “tired, poor, and huddled masses yearning to be free,” but for millions of economic refugees bringing advanced skills and often superior education that enable them to jump-start their careers in the New World. When the history of this era is written in centuries to come, the rapid shift from colonization to globalization will surely rise to the fore.in a broader sense it stands for the experience of millions of Asian, Latin American, and Eastern European immigrants as well — just the latest installment in America’s centuries-long history as a refuge not just for the “tired, poor, and huddled masses yearning to be free,” but for millions of economic refugees bringing advanced skills and often superior education that enable them to jump-start their careers in the New World.

B0006IIKS0|5|I saw this movie twice before from DVD's I borrowed and I just had to own it. I've told people about it and wanted to show it to friends. And I want to see it again and again! It is so very honest. I was a bit surprised that Metallica let it come out. It doesn't always show them in the best light. It shows their emotions and passion and their very dynamic, creative personalities. Even if you don't like their music, you will enjoy this inside look into the lives of one of the most famous bands in the world.
B002JVWR4A|5|love it a lot and I am happy to buy this show a lot
B00RY7DCE8|1|Good thing this was free because when I got to level 40 it wouldn't open. It was at least a 4 star up until then.
B0013ND36G|3|So I ordered this because apparently there are 2 different transfers of the Blu-Ray and I wanted the best looking one. That part wasn't the issue, I received the correct transfer, however, the box art had dual languages on it. English and Spanish. It's not a huge deal, but the product was not described as such anywhere on the page. Plus it looks a little out of place on my shelf.
B00V4JJPKM|4|If you enjoy a very good musical with top-of-the-class actors this is it.
B006FS22Y8|5|I've been a fan since I saw the 'Rehab' video on a plane from Germany in 2006 or 7. Listening to some of these songs actually make me tear up a bit. Overall, a great offering.
B0002234LS|5|Yeah, I'm a product of that time period when people caught in a claustrophobic set freaked out and reacted. \\"Secret Window\\" is always fun, Depp is wonderful, Koepp works well with the script & direction. John Turturro, most underrated, is excellent; strong and determined. Johnny Depp never fails to entertain me. This may not be his best film, but certainly a new addition to his many personalities. There are good extras on the DVD, mostly of Koepp banging his own drum. (I liked \\"Stir of Echoes\\"...) I want to take issue that a previous reviewer said this was among the best adaptations of Stephen King. I think that Frank Darabont's adaptations of \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\" were far superior. On the tension level, though, this works for me. (I liked Rob Reiner's \\"Misery\\", too.) I'd like to have Mr. Koepp make a coherent version of a Dean Koontz book..it hasn't happened yet. Koepp could do it.
B006MW3V6U|5|If you're a fan of &#34;historical-biographical&#34; shows this is right up there.  Though it is fiction, the people and events around them are quite believable.  My wife came home from work and everyone was talking about this show.  So when I heard even Rush Limbaugh gush over it, it made me look into it.  We did the first season off Netflix and found the second here on Amazon.  We recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of storytelling.
B005IQZB14|5|I have to admit when I started reading this boo,. I found it hard to make it through the beginning. So much so that I out it down for 4 months before I picked it up again. Perhaps it is because I am so close to my mother who is getting on in age and it gently forces me to think of losing her. However, I finally picked it up again and made it through to the beginning of her long journey on the PCT. When she had finally made it, I found myself weeping with her at the end. That totally caught me off guard but it felt so good to cry with her. I might never get a chance to take a journey like this but I'm glad I went on it vicariously through her book.
B008IJTFYW|5|What a wonderful app to listen to to help you relax or to fall asleep. Great relaxing sounds. So many choices. You can mix the sounds and adjust the sound level for each individual sound when you create multi sound mixes. If you pass this one by. You're really missing something.
B0000C9ZLD|4|I wasn't attracted to the strokes at all when they released their first alblum. And  still wasn't into them when they released their second alblum. Then I was coaxed into seeing them in concert; from that day on I have not blasphemed the name of the Strokes. Guys, if you are riding the fence on your likeing for this band, go see them live. Its like having a come to Jesus meeting. With that said, Room on Fire: good but not great and it stays in my CD player quite a bit.
B00AEFYKWU|5|This was a gift for my folks and they absolutely love it.
B008Z9YLV2|5|Very good concept for a movie. Can't wait for the next one. It's suspenseful and entertaining.<br />Hope this doesn't become reality.
B00006IU73|5|Here is a rundown of each song: <br /> <br />Blackest Eyes: This is the best opening song ever made. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br />Trains: Perfect song, beautiful, and most people's favorite PT song, I have found. <br /> <br />Lips of Ashes: Seen as a transition song, this actually holds its own as a brilliant gem. This is probably PT's best makeout/hookup song, and has such nice harmonies and atmosphere. Wow. <br /> <br />The Sound of Muzak: One of PT's greatest riffs, this used to be my favorite song of all time, but I think I listened to it a few too many times...still terrific and innovative.  <br /> <br />Gravity Eyelids: This song must grow on you, but the second verse, when the bass comes in, might be my favorite PT moment of all.  <br /> <br />(By the way, I'm really not exaggerating about these) <br /> <br />Wedding Nails: Awesome! PT's heaviest song yet (at that point), this instrumental is just killer and never gets old. Great riff and jam section in the middle. <br /> <br />I must interrupt my rundown to say this: After listening to the first six songs, it is safe to say that if the album continues to be this good, it is easily the best album of all time. Unfortunately, the album gets worse in the second half... :( <br /> <br />Prodigal: Eh. Kinda boring I guess, it has its moments though, and an awesome ending, with a great drum fill. <br /> <br />.3: This is not a very good song. Some cool harmonies but other than that pretty dull. <br /> <br />The Creator Has a Mastertape: It takes a lot of listens to really absorb this track, as it is the busiest song on the album, but I think it's great. The riff is very different than what PT normally does, and extremely dark overall, but works great for the tone of the album. <br /> <br />Heartattack in a Layby: Here's the thing with this one. I have listened to this song many times on the CD, and was never thoroughly blown away with it. Then, when I saw it live, it absolutely got me, the harmonies at theend are just sublime. Terrific song. <br /> <br />Strip the Soul: Not as good as everyone says it is, and sounds a lot like .3, which is a big thumbs down, but still okay. <br /> <br />Collapse the Light into Earth: I don't know how I can say this really, but I don't like this one at all. Probably my least favorite PT track of all.  <br /> <br />This album still gets 5 stars, just because of the first half, and if ONLY the last 6 could keep up with the first.
B000060MY6|5|David Lynch continues to amaze me with his latest film \\"Mulholland Drive\\", a bizarre journey into psychosis and beyond.   Subliminally, demons are exorcized  while viewing subtle nuances of complete madness that will permeate subconciousness.   This film was totally unpredictable and all of the performances were incredible. One of the defining moments of the film is where Betty fails to heed Coco's warning of the iminant danger in her apartment, she obviously did not get rid of the trouble and consequently, she is taken on a dangerous journey into a downward spiraled path she chose to follow.    There is so much depth and complexity to this film, it is nearly impossible to draw any kind of significant conclusion.  It's like asking someone why they are gay?  So may theories and oppinions but in the end, it all remains subjective.  Can you explain why Betty's shruken mother and father try and scare her to death?  I sure can't, but this adds to the mystery of delusion.  My theory of the meaning of this film is, I compare it to \\"Vanilla Sky\\" and \\"Jacob's Ladder\\". I think the first half of the movie is Diane/Betty's decent into death laced with nightmarish images of her subconsious, and the second half is what actually happened leading up to her suicide?  And was that Betty/Diane actually commiting suicide in the bed?  All of this makes you want to throw \\"the rubik's cube\\" as one reviewer put it, against the wall.  In an ethereal aspect, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is a hypnotic film that has a trance like effect on all of your senses.  It soothes, compels, disorients, intoxicates, frustrates, excites, frightens, and teases. A pyschological mind-...that David Lynch orchestrates magnificantly to the open-minded, free-spirited lost souls of the world, in search of truth and meaning.
B004RKXW0E|4|The movie itself is great, it's really good for kids, and they'll definitely love it. It also has things in it that will be funny for adults, but kids won't be able to notice it. The movie came early, and in excellent condition.
B007J4T2G8|3|Cheesy descriptions, and a little unrealistic.. NOBODY has sex that much! And no girl would stay through that. Otherwise it was entertaining.

B000056K04|4|I love dave matthews band.  All there cd's are great.  This is not what you would normally expect from dave matthews.  It is different.  It is an okay cd with a bunch of good songs but not all.  I think the best song on the cd is definitly DREAMS OF OUR FATHERS its more rock.

B001GZ6QEC|5|Good Test   Do you believe you are a good person? Have you kept the Ten Commandments? Take this quick test to see if you are. Ready? Have you ever lied, a white lie, half truth, exaggeration etc?  What does this make you?  If I lied to you what would you call me... a liar. Have you ever stolen something regardless of its value?  What does this make you? A thief?   Have you ever used God's name as a cuss word? If you have you have, instead of using a four letter filth word to express disgust you have taken God's name, He that has given you your life, your family everything you hold precious to you and you've used it as a four letter filth word to express disgust. This is called blasphemy, and every idle word a man speaks he will give an account of it on the Day of Judgment. God will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain.    Have you ever lusted? Jesus said whosoever has looked upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Are you guilty? Please listen to your conscience that God has given to you and be honest. You can't tell me that you do not know what is right and wrong.  If I reached into your back pocket and took a twenty dollar bill without your consent, you'd be alright with that? You know the basis of what's right and wrong, listen to your conscience and be honest with yourself.   If I may continue, in knowing that you have answered these questions honestly, then by your own admission you are a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart. And these are only four of the Ten Commandments.  So, if by these standards God judges you on the Day of Judgment do you think you would be innocent or guilty? Do you think you will go to Heaven or Hell?    You may object by saying, \\"Well I don't believe in Heaven or Hell.\\" If I stood on top of a building and just before I jumped I yelled at the top of my lungs \\"I don't believe in gravity,\\" that isn't going to change reality.  You see gravity is a law, and even if I believe that this law doesn't hold true doesn't change the fact that that if I jump it's the merciless pavement that I am going to meet.   If your answer is Hell, then does this concern you? Think of how much you value your eyes. If I were to offer you one-million dollars for one of your eyes, in a painless procedure, would you give it to me? Now if I offered you two-million dollars for both your eyes would you give them to me? How about five million? Ten? Twenty? Thirty-million? No man in his right mind would offer to give up both his eyes for any amount. If so what would you do with your money? See the world? If this is how much you value your eyes then how much more is the value of your soul?    If you think you would go to Heaven, why? Do you believe that God is all loving and good, and therefore will overlook your sins? Try that in a court of law: you are standing in front of a judge; you are guilty of a serious crime like murder. The judge says\\" You are guilty and all the evidence is here what do you have to say for yourself before I pass sentence?\\" And you stand up and say, \\"Yes, judge I just have to say that I believe that you are a good man and therefore will let me go.\\" The judge will probably say something like, \\"You're right about one thing I am a good man. And because of my goodness I am going to see to it that justice is served. Because of my goodness I am going to see to it that you are punished for what you have done.\\" You see God is love, but he is also righteous, holy, just and pure. It is because He is good that by nature he must punish the wicked: liars, thieves, fornicators, etc. \\"Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, or covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortinoners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\\" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 He demands righteousness even in the inward parts.   So thetruth is, if God gives you justice you are not headed for Heaven you are headed for Hell. The bible describes hell as a literal place of torture Hell is not a term for the grave but a place where God will punish those who have violated His law. This punishment will be conscious and eternal. The bible describes it in several ways:  \\"Shame and everlasting contempt\\" (Dan. 12:2); \\"Weeping and gnashing of teeth\\" (Matt. 24:51); \\"Eternal fire... the blackness of darkness forever\\" (Jude 7, 13); \\"He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... the smoke of their torment ascended up forever and ever: and they have no rest day or night.\\" (Revelation 14:10, 11)   Do you see your need for God's forgiveness? How you have violated His law and remain under His wrath?  If you do I have got some wonderful news for you, put yourself back in the court room. You are in a civil court this time there are multiple crimes against you. Your fine has been set at $500,000 or life imprisonment. You can't pay your fine and you are being led off to prison when all of a sudden someone you don't even know steps into the court room and walks up to the judge and hands him a check for $500,000. And pays your fine in full. The judge says to you, \\"Wait your fine has just been paid for you. You are free to go. I can't hold you here anymore, leave, you are free to go on the grounds that this man has paid your fine; and his sacrifice is a demonstration for his great love for you.    That's what happened, that's what God did for us 2,000 years ago!  Jesus stepped into the court room and paid our fine when he died on the cross for our sins. The God of the universe humbled Himself, and became a man, and died on the cross for you and for me. The Bible says that, God demonstrated his live for us that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.  Jesus Christ redeemed us from the cures of the law being made a curse for us.  You see your need for God your need to get right with Him, what do you do? Repent and put your faith in Christ. Repentance simply means turn away from your sin and turn toward God. Desire to have nothing to do with sin. Desire to live in obedience to the Lord. Confess and forsake your sin and begin to move toward God with a desire never to go back to sin. You won't be perfect but Jesus is perfect and he died for you and he will give you the power to overcome your sin. When you are born again you put your faith in Jesus Christ. It doesn't just mean intellectually believing that he died on the cross. The demons believe and they tremble, they know that's true. You must put your faith in Jesus. That means to trust Jesus the same way you would put your trust in a parachute if you were jumping out of a plane at twenty-five thousand feet. You know that it's the only thing that's going to save you. If I told you, you were going to jump and there was a parachute under your seat what would you do? You'd put it on. Would it do you any good to just believe in the parachute? No. And that's what the bible says put on the Lord Jesus Christ. How do you do that? Obey the gospel, repent of your sin, and trust Jesus Christ. And you will become a new creation in Christ.    Please place your faith in Jesus as you would a parachute. And entrust your life to Him; he is the only one who will be able to save you from sure death when you jump. Don't delay because you never know what tomorrow will hold- if it ever comes.   Thank you for listening to me and I will be praying for you.  ~M.C.

0800141660|5|Another Jane Austen great! Emma Thompson was wonderful as Elinor. She embodied the ideal of \\"sensibility\\" in love. She deserved the Golden Globe award for \\"best screenplay\\". Alan Rickman as the \\"Colonel\\" was very impressive. I imagine it would be an actor's dream to act in one of Jane Austen's novels on screen.    I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good, romantic film.

0446310786|5|A true classic.  I have read it more than once.
1400063515|5|Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan is about how people, including academics, are unable to properly gauge uncertainty thus setting themselves up for disaster, or Black Swan events.     Black swan events are like one-time events or very infrequent unpredictable events that disrupt the mediocrity of human life.  Examples of Black Swan events are the collapse of LTCM, The Crash of '87, and maybe the housing collapse.  Black Swans plague human history; however for many reasons people, including academics, are blind to them.  This book tries to make the reader aware of Black Swans and give reasons why people are blind to them.  This book also contends why mainstream academics have it wrong when gauging uncertainty.    One of the problems I had was that this book wasn't very cohesive.  The book goes from one subject to subject not in a streamline manner.  I had to jot down notes to keep track on what was written.  I would have given a 4-star for this, but the idea of Black Swan events was compelling enough for a good rating.    This book is an easier read than Fooled by Randomness.  It was slow reading though because it is pretty deep.  It was a good book.    Here are the highlights and my takeaway:  - Guassian bell curves are for most applications worthless, but people use the curves to gauge uncertainty.   - This book goes against conventional wisdom  - Despite the occurrences of Black Swans, people fool themselves into thinking that Black Swans were predictable and hence unimpressive events.   Even worse, people set themselves up for a Black Swan event instead of trying to avoid the possibility of a Black Swan.  - Black Swans live in scalable environments, instead of non-scalable environments.  People live as if in a non-scalable world when the modern world is more like a scalable world.    This book provides lots of reasons why people are blind to Black Swans.  Blacks Swans are tough to predict to begin with, but the problem is compounded when people are blind to Black Swans.  This book tries to make the reader aware of the existence of Black Swan events.    I read Thomas Sowell's Intellectuals and Society and I think there is a bit of crossover between both books.  Taleb's book is not political; however Taleb's description of the Platonifiers is similar to Sowell's description of Intellectuals.  Both Sowell and Taleb mention the idea of knowledge being spread across the populace.  Sowell mentions that knowledge is too vast to be contained by the few.  Taleb mentions that even people like the Platonifiers lack the knowledge to predict future given the numerous and unknown variables.    If you're a trailblazer who is puzzled why you cannot seem to get people to go along with you, this book is for you.  Also, I would recommend this book to those who liked Taleb's Fooled by Randomness and to those who are fans of Malcolm Gladwell's books.  This book is a whole lot easier to read than his other book, Fooled by Randomness.  This book is pretty deep so expect slow reading.

I also like the style of writing that the author has chosen to write this book. I also read the previous books and enjoyed too. I think this book is a great gift fro any one who enjoys reading like I do.
B006OCM0G0|5|I love this game! it has many things you can do for free, instead of having to pay money to unlock some content.
B00EL8I8IS|5|Great movie. With the reality of global spread of diseases such as Ebola, this movie captivates you.
B00OX3F1JK|5|This story is Hope. It is explicit in it's rendering.  It provides a glimpse into the far-reaching past and the tumultuous present world.  The powers of governmental agencies and the Catholic Church are feared and at the same time awesome...people trying to stay alive to tell the story to the world feel alone, as are we all....a must read.
B000002GIE|5|This album is full of childhood cliches. That's the plot for this wonderful debut CD from the Boston native rock band Extreme. But not all songs point to childhood cliches. Songs like &quot;Watching Waiting&quot;  examine the crucifixion of Christ. &quot;Rock A Bye,Bye&quot; examines the  issue of abortion in this world. This album has been blessed with some  great guitar work by their axeman Nuno Bettencourt. Gary Cherone does a  great job on the mic creating a child like sound to his voice in some  songs. Pat and Paul do justice as well. A great sonic performance!
B00F87ZUYG|5|Awesome show. Shows you don't only fear the dead but but the living is just as dangerous! Going to become a classic

B000MAH5O2|4|I am not a fan of BO by any means but this book was well written. I find many of his conclusions about how American can do better to be unrealistic and perfectly in line with his ultra-liberal mindset. He lays out his agenda for all to see and when it comes time for him to implement it he does what he criticizes by acting unilaterally without consent or thought of those in the minority. I found that a lot of his &#34;principles&#34; to be very superficial and one can only hope that was just the writing but his actions now as president prove that he just is what the book portrays him to be.
0470876417|5|This book is fantastic. I've always done business plans for big or small ideas which I've had, however they tend to be pages, and still don't capture all of what was needed. This framework for building business models makes it so easy and structure at the same time it will be something which I'll be doing for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Don't buy the Kindle version of this book, because it is a highly visual book and it is a really good looking book to hold in your hands. I love my kindle but this is something which can be passed around so others around you can understand what you mean when you start to talk about the model
B007ZD17XO|5|This is the third edition of this game that I have played and it is, without a doubt, the best. It's fast paced, completely addictive, and a blast to play. The graphics look great on my Android tablet and the game play is excellent.

1881273156|5|1. Is this an in depth presentation? <br /> <br />This book discusses the five love languages and the variants of each.  The book serves primarily to introduce the reader to these languages and their \\"dialects\\".  There are also many examples in the book of how the different love languages operate in the lives of married couples.  I would say that the book is a very good and workable introduction to the topic, but not an in depth presentation. <br /> <br />2. To what extent does the author address current situations? <br /> <br />The five love languages are applicable to all people in all situations.  These love languages are as old as the human race itself and that makes the book very topical.  This book develops the theme of the five love languages around the covenant of marriage.  Couples where spouses are not fulfilling each other's emotional needs will find a new approach to their marriages in this book.  This book can also be applied to other relationships and the reader will learn to express his love to other people in a constructive manner.  The book will also sensitise the reader to his own love language making it easier to communicate his need for love to other people.  <br /> <br />3. Was there any new information? <br /> <br />The five love languages discussed were new information to me.  The love languages are: <br />* Words of affirmation - the love that is communicated by speaking words of edification to a person.  <br />* Quality time - the love that is communicated by setting aside specific time to spend with a person. <br />* Receiving gifts - the love that is communicated by giving gifts to a person.  The gift can also be the gift of self. <br />* Acts of service - the love that is communicated by being a servant to someone. <br />* Physical touch - the love that is communicated by physically touching someone. <br /> <br />4. What impact did the book have on me? <br /> <br />I did a bit of soul searching while reading this book.  My inability to receive love from my father suddenly became clear:  He did not love me in my primary love language.  I discovered that my primary love language is words of affirmation.  This explains why I find people being critical of me so wounding, especially people whom I love.  I have also started thinking on how I can love my friends better by focussing on their primary love language. <br /> <br />5. Other positive or negative perceptions? <br /> <br />In Chapter 14 the author makes mention of his rediscovery of a need for God when his marriage was in trouble.  In his search for God he found Jesus Christ and committed his life to Him.  He states how Jesus loved those who crucified him.  I believe the point that Mr Chapman is trying to make is that the power to love is rooted in the supernatural power of God at work in our lives.  In the context of the Five Love Languages that means that Jesus died so that marriages could flourish.
B001RP1G0U|2|I turned it off halfway through...shouldn't have rented it to begin with.  It was boring and unrealistic.  You don't really care what happens to these people.
B0002F6AH0|5|Thirty years after it's debut, this watershed miniseries is still the best single documentary ever made about World War II. Expertly blending archival footage with eyewitness accounts of the participants themselves, a first rate soundtrack as well as a beautiful, haunting narration supplied by none other than Sir Laurence Olivier himself, well, you  simply have an unsurpassable combination. <br />American viewers might be put off by certain things. Yes, it does look like the British Army won the Battle of Normandy, and true it does say that the British came in from the north to put pressure on the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge (actual British participation in the Bulge was very small), and it does make it look like the British met the Russians before the Americans did. And the Pacific has only a handful of episodes as compared to Europe. Okay, with that said, I can only answer with, so what? This was a British production after all, and they have a right to be proud of their accomplishments as do we. Frankly, I enjoyed seeing the footage used correctly. You don't see 1940 German Army footage being advertised as 1944. The pacing is superb. Add to this that at least they tried to get all sides of the story. The Germans aren't painted to be the robotic fanatics as others have done and they strain for objectivity. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this series. Rent it. If you've seen it, then buy it. This is the kind of excellence all documentaries should shoot for.
B00HWL6YDC|5|Love this book. Was addicted from the very start. Brought tears to my eyes. Couldn't put down till the very end. I recommend reading it
B005CRQ4XI|5|I'll admit I was interested in this book because it was an Oprah Book Club choice, and I was not disappointed.  Wild drew me in from the very beginning. Ms. Strayed's description of her journey, both emotional and physical, were wonderfully detailed and vivid. I didn't want the book to end.  I'm looking forward to reading her novel.<br /><br />Wild is a fantastic memoir. Highly recommended.
B002KQ6BT6|3|I was in 2 minds about this book.  I thought it came out too fast after the others, so I did have lower expectations.  But it delivered the story, and did carry me along so I did not put it down until done.  It did seem lengthy and repetitive at times.  I almost felt I needed to know Washington, so in some ways the detailed directions were a hindrance as I did not know the places mentioned in relation to each other, but I felt the way he kept detailing the geography was for our benefit. My purpose in reading novels is to be taken somewhere else and not to worry too much about the literature of it all, although it is a bonus if that is good too.  This was meant to be an exciting read and that's about it.

630575067X|2|Why do critics say such nasty things like, &quot;Phantom Menace has a weak, convoluted plot&quot; or &quot;it lacks depth of characters,&quot; or &quot;it's visually busy, but paradoxically boring?&quot;  Don't they know  that this is but the first part of a huge merchandising campaign?  Don't  they understand that George Lucas has expanded from the first trilogy,  seeking new ground in saturation of subliminal toy advertisements in every  frame of the picture?<br /> Those who pan this movie should get a life!  Our  economy has been blessed with over 400 billion tons of Phantom Menace toys  and games, not to mention real cool candy.  And then there's Jar-Jar Binks.  &quot;Mesa knows you gonna go and buy de toys and stuff, ah dat for  sure!&quot;<br /> The original trilogy just didn't have the commerical  &quot;oomph&quot; behind it that this one does. What a wonderful  difference. Oh, so what if the plot dragged and the acting was horrible?   After viewing this wonderful film, I ran out and spent over half my college  savings on some really AWESOME Darth Maul fashion accesories. Thank you Mr.  Lucas -- you have restored my faith in filmakers as well as the artistic  integrity of today's movie audiences!
B00BHUB11Y|5|Must have classic.  Amazon streaming/prime is the cheapest way I could find this movie.  Had to track it down on amazon on PC to find it though,  XBOX and Sony products didn't have it listed when I searched for it.

0800105141|5|I viewed this movie as a requirement in my &quot;world studies&quot; class during our unit on British Imperialism. The on-screen representation of Gandhi's personality gave me a finer insight into his motivations and background. One particular element to the story I found fulfilling was the display of younger Gandhi as an educated &quot;British&quot; lawyer. His change in identity was very well portrayed as he grew closer to his people. This video was an absolutely excellent supplement to my studies on Gandhi and imperialism. Gandhi's political success was an awesome sight to see portrayed. The manner in which such a frail old man as Gandhi overpowers an entire empire is nearly miraculous, and his attempts at unifying a very religiously diverse India are noble. Gandhi proved to the world that violence is an unnecessary element to &quot;fighting&quot; for change, and that non-violence can be even more effective. It is not hard to tell why people such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez, both leaders in civil rights movements, were inspired by the achievements of Gandhi, and modeled their political activism after his non-violent model. I felt that this movie exquisitely portrayed Gandhi's persona, his aspirations, and his accomplishments. I very strongly recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about Gandhi, and anyone who would like to vicariously witness the spectacular accomplishments of one of the greatest persons in history.

B004TMPJP6|5|This is app is a very useful tool for me. I have 2 jobs, serve on 2 boards, and several ministries. Wunderlist really helps me to keep my m mind together! I am able to create different lists for different areas of my life, view them all together by what's due or coming up soon, or view just by area so that it seems less intimidating. The new features have greatly improved functionality: sub-tasks, ability to move tasks between lists, automatic shifting of incomplete tasks to &quot;today&quot;, and the new reoccurring feature. I love that I can schedule a reminder and that I can access my Wunderlist from all of my devices (Kindle, Iphone, home &amp; work PC)
B0007TKNL0|5|I first saw the play at Her Majesty's Theater in London and then about 12 more times in the United States, mostly in New York and in Washington, DC.  Obviously, I love this great play and especially its fantastic music!!!  To my great pleasure, the movie is better, by far!  The movie explains everything and shows so much more than the play ever could.  All of the glorious music is exactly the same, but every single scene in the movie is far better than the play.  Treat yourself to one of the greatest stories and music scores ever to hit the theater, and now the big screen!  Buy this timeless classic and you can own it forever, to watch over and over for a lifetime of enjoyment.  It is by far the very best there is!  Enjoy!
B0009P5YXO|5|Oh my! This gift was a hit and it was for a 42 year old man. He loves it and uses it so much it annoys me. :)
B0098QBEXO|5|This movie broke my heart. So sad and touching and wonderful. Benedict Cumberbatch is in top form, as always, and I absolutely LOVED this.
B005OCFHHK|5|My kids want to do a marathon session of all 8 movies with their friends.  I was able to find an 11 disc Blu-Ray set of movies 1-8 at Amazon UK.  It had a list price of 32 pounds but you don't have to pay the VAT so it came out to only 30 pounds including shipping or just $48.  I'm not sure what will be on the extra three discs compared to the US version, perhaps some of the extra features some people are so upset about...  My kids don't care about the extra features so I was only looking for the cheapest versions of the standard theatrical releases in BD, but for $34 less I'll take the special features and wait til 2nd week of December to receive it.   They also have a limited edition version which has 19 discs and a book and a \\"numbered\\" box, I assume this has all the features everyone wants...  It's about twice the price.  Both versions are Region Free so they will work on any player unlike the DVD versions which only work on European formatted TV's and players.
B009YP9L7U|3|What started out as a night of a few drinks with friends, ends with Megan married to a Connor. And, to make an awkward situation worse, she doesn't remember anything when she wakes up in his bed the next morning. What Megan quickly catagorizes as a mistake, Connor isn't so quick to agree. So he sets out to convince her otherwise...<br /><br />It was a decent, short romance read. Good chemistry (especially that first morning after) but maybe a little too over the top for me at times. I guess Connor - while still likable - lost some of this attractiveness to me because he was trying too hard at times.<br /><br />I received this ebook from Netgalley in exchange for a honest review.
B004RKXHZY|5|I had plans to do things tonight.<br /><br />Like actual things that needed to be done.<br /><br />I made the mistake of starting this book around 10 something, and I could not put it down until I was done.<br /><br />It's almost 1:30. AM.<br /><br />You see the issue.<br /><br />GUYS. GUYS. THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK IS EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS. SERIOUSLY.<br /><br />Okay first of all- Anna and St. Claire are back and I love seeing more of them! It's freaking adorable. I love having them back in some small way. Yay!<br /><br />Second of all- LOVE Lola. I love her. She's so different and wonderful and Stephanie Perkins has this marvelous way of writing about love, and different kinds of love- including the one that doesn't work out. And we really get to see that tug of war with Lola- in relation to her feelings for Max and Cricket. And the thing is- it makes SENSE. I LOVE THAT.<br /><br />In Anna, we saw St. Claire have a similar tug of war with Anna and his girlfriend- but I felt more frustration than sympathy for him and even for Anna at times. There were a lot of communication issues.<br /><br />But with Lola and Cricket- they're honest from the very beginning and especially when it matters most. And like I said- it MAKES SENSE. I also feel like we get more of their characters, and the secondary characters as well. We get deeper into who they really are. And I love that.<br /><br />I love this book. I love it I love it I love it. I think it's a definite step up from Anna (which I enjoyed immensely as well- my God this woman knows how to create an addicting read) and it's a definite gem among young adult contemporary romance these days.<br /><br />I tip my hat to you Miss Perkins.<br /><br />Can I have the next one now?
006441034X|5|Hilarious, unpredictable, and exciting; with unforgettable characters and a great scarecrow.  Not to mention the dog.<BR>One of Wynne Jones's best -- don't miss out!
B0000VCZKM|5|My daughter loved Annie when she was growing up.  I decided to purchase this special edition Annie DVD for my granddaughter's second birthday and it was a perfect choice!  She loves watching this movie and singing the songs as much as her mommy did  - - the Annie tradition continues!

B004GJXQ20|5|I read the book after watching the first 4 seasons of the tv show and was blown away at how close the show kept to the book.  I'm nervous to hear that later season dont follow the books as closely as i am finding them extremely well written and super easy to read.
B000ZK4466|5|The fact that this band not only exists, but flourishes in the music industry always amazes me....this time around, Omar Rodriguez and co (with the help of friends) dish up a more guitar-oriented, more palatable platter of bizarre, hallucinogenic experimental conceptual music.<br /><br /> A few more \\"hooks\\" and memorable melodic ideas than their last release, \\"Amputechture\\", and a more propulsive, driving percussion style in the driving, quasi-prog rock style of \\"Deloused In The Comatorium\\". More Geddy-Lee-esque shrieking ala Rush's \\"The Temples Of Syrinx\\". More irrational, dreamlike poetic narrative ala William Burroughs meets Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Exceptionally weird artwork. More wondering exactly what the hell is going on. Check it out.
0547884591|5|Ive been a long time reader of Tim's books/blog and waited a long time to see this guy get released. the body book changed my life and i expect this one to do the same. It's beautifully assembled and elegantly sequenced!! you can definitely see his growth as an author, and his personality come out on every page.. i especially liked the pairing of the songs to the recipes the way one would pair wines to a meal!! cant wait to try every single one!! great job tim!!!
B002KDUDG6|4|It is the same wonderful, smooth style you'd expect from Michael Buble.  I would highly recommend purchasing it!  This has a couple of new delightful twists; but it is all Michael.  He's such a cutie ... Go for it.  I didn't think I'd love this type of jazz, but it is really good.
B00006HAZG|5|This was an inspiring dvd to watch, it went through a life story of a infant to a young man... <BR>the characters in this extraorindary film were intriguing and always grabbed my attention in some way...<BR>seems that i watched it with my class, it has captured our attention and made us realise what it was like living in the late 1800's and how lucky and fotunate we are...<BR>the only thing that i didnt like about this was that it was very predictable...<BR>It is was  good as Harry Potter Because the characeters are so a like. Why? because they are the same people. Aunt betsey is as good as an Actress in her days of David Copperfield as when she was Professor McGonagall, David may be a little older in Harry Potter, but he still has the talent (and his winking in one eye) and as you would know, the evil wicked Mrs Murdstone is the lovely witch who teaches Harry to fly - Madam Hooch.i would reccomend this movie to anyone whol likes a bit of everything..
B00318DA3W|4|I found myself rereading many passages for the purpose of savoring Jane Austen 's turn of phrase.  As always, her understanding of human relationships is demonstrated on every page.  Her insight was obviously developed after much acute observation and deep thought.  I thoroughly enjoy every mental journey her books impart.

B00DA6YEKS|5|Mark my words...Sanderson is the next J.R.R. Tolkien. I could not stop reading. I can't wait to read the next book in this epic. I guess I'll have to find another Sanderson book to read while I wait. This is a must read series, I've never read anything this amazing.
B00005RYKU|5|An excellent movie, very entertaining - the suspense is great, the story is very interesting and very original. Lee Lee Sobieski is doing really, really great, and the other actors too. I enjoyed all the movie from start to finish, it was really good viewing it and it is a good buy !
B000EJ9MTW|4|Listen i am not an expert as are most of us out here listening to music. But I am big on 60's-80's real rock! <br /> <br />we lost that in the 90's due to the Grunge stuff! <br /> <br />Well this is pretty darn good. <br /> <br />Everyone on here who does slam Wolfmother siting no originality, blah blah blah <br /> <br />Hey it sound pretty good to me! <br /> <br />One song actually reminds me of a great little band from the mid to late 90's Toadies its called \\"Where the Eagles have been\\" <br /> <br />listen to it and listen to some Toadies.......... <br /> <br />go figure <br /> <br />Rock on! rock on! <br /> <br />BTW the only band that would get a 5 star from me is if SRV himself came back from the dead with an album with Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Albert King and BB King!!!!!! <br /> <br />Kinda set in my ways!
B00DVKOYBM|5|I recommend this for anyone that loves 8ball pool. It's got everything a pool player could dream of. It has championships, PvP, practice, country ranks, and you can use Facebook to challenge your friends and see where you rank amongst them.

Oh well, the truth is that we all make mistakes, including scientists and nutricianists.  Read this book.  You'll be bombarded with scientific proof that carbs cause fat.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Fantastic book that lives up to its buzz!  I loved it and will seek out more from this author.
B00C5W3SBE|3|This movie got a lot of hype, and the special effects werre awesome, but the story did not really keep me entertained through the entire movie.  I was a little disappointed with the hype this movie got relative to how I felt about it when I finished watching it.<br /><br />I love sci fi movies, and action movies, but this one just did not strike a good note with me.
030759565X|5|My friend knows the author, and had shared a few recipes with me, so when I heard she had a book, I nabbed it! The hardest thing to do was decided whether to give it away or keep it. I eventually gave it. She loves it!

B00AREIAI8|4|This is a very fun game. The graphics are wonderful! It has its down sides though. Such as you need money for everything and can't get it very easily. Love getting to ride it and train it! Shouldn't take so many energy points when training!
B004SKJTY6|5|How can one not be interested in a disabled monarch? The thought causes sympathy and a bit of fear. Yet however gripping the story, it is the wonderful acting that keeps one's attention. What great casting! What fine actors!
B00K0OI42W|5|I read this book once again after many years. Still such an awesome read. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Lee's character developments are so creative and enthralling. What I most enjoyed in this book, reading it as an adult,was the story narrated by a little girl. Seeing the world in her perspective and through her eyes. Lovely, can't put down read.
B0026KX4HS|3|Was a good movie, but had trouble watching due to connection issues or something.
0679746048|5|This is one of my favorite books of all time - if you're even *considering* buying this book, please do it!  If you're a fan of The Bell Jar, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden or other books dealing with psychology, you'll love it. <br /> <br />Girl, Interrupted will made me laugh, cry, and feel everything between!  Delving into the mind of Susanna Kayson, she describes in her memoir what it was like to live in Belmont - an expensive mental hospital - for almost two years during the 60's.  Each character is so unique and engrossing, I wasn't able to put the book down.  Now, even though I've read it so many times that the spine is wearing out, I still can't put it down once I stop!  You'll love this book to death - and knowing that it's a true story makes it that much more facsinating.
1904994679|3|When I first started collecting Guinness Books, they were fun and all about the real amazing records.  Now they're a bit crazy and focus on the gross things that I barely even consider &#34;a record&#34; (like tattoos, piercings, etc.).  The science and technology sections are still really amazing.<br /><br />Wish they went back to their roots instead of focusing on the &#34;freak-show&#34; aspects of the world.
B004N6369Y|5|Awesome story....couldn't put it down. Just when you think there can't be another twist...bam, there it is. Thank you Mrs Steele.

8862933177|5|This Journal is a great way to keep track of your favourite flicks and makes easier to share this info with friends and loved ones.
B000002MY3|5|Alanis' best. None of her follow up records can compare to Jagged Little Pill. &quot;Hand In My Pocket&quot; is the best song on the album. Five stars just for that song. JLP is a classic record in a league of it's own. I don't know which is better. JLP or Tori Amos' &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;. They're a tie.
B00F8L2VO4|4|Simple and effective
B004J4WKTW|4|Very unusual story.  I loved the characters in this book.  The magic and illusions in this story made it very intersting.
B00371QQ8Y|1|Universal, for some reason, has elected to continue to produce these double sided disks that contains the Blu-ray movie on one side and the DVD on the flip-side. Why is it that Universal cannot follow in Disney's lead and release these movies as two disk sets. Disney has combo disks that contains the Blu ray and DVD version in the same release, but the DVD and Blu ray disks are on separate disks, utilizing single sided disks.    I seriously do NOT recommend this item for purchase.
B003L77TZI|1|If ever a singer was born with a flat boring voice,Katy Perry was/is. Her top song \\"Fireworks\\",is another example of a dumb song sung by an even more juvenile singer.When I see Katy Perry sing on award shows I realize that she isn't a singer at all,just another minimal talent dressed up like a sexy lady with silly props to prop up the no-talent. Calling her Generic would be too kind.She is a parody of a singer.Don't buy this rubbish.
B00005N9CV|5|I usually will not add my review if a CD or book or video has already lots of reviews.  I mean:  what is left to say?<br />I felt, however, after reading about 20 reviews of Diana Krall's new THE LOOK OF LOVE that I wanted to write what is obviously a minority point of view.  I LOVED this album.  It reminded me of the Frank Sinatra &quot;theme&quot; albums like &quot;Only The Lonely&quot; where all the songs on the disc were of one mood.  Here is Krall singing one gorgeous love song after another, accompanying herself, as always, on the piano with a small jazz combo and backed by a studio orchestra and the London Symphony.  The orchestrations are lush, the sound on the CD is terrific and Krall is singing like I've never heard her sing.  Every number is tops and done in Krall's signature throaty, sexy, husky style.<br />I especially enjoyed Schwartz and Dietz's &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; which is, in my opinion, one of the finest pop songs of all time and which cannot be allowed to be forgotten.  Since the horrors of September 11, alot of songs with first rate lyrics take on all new meanings and here is a song which says, &quot;We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here/Time hurries by/We're here and gone.&quot;<br />This is a cuddle by the fireside with someone you love album.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B001HN694K|4|OK, I had my doubts about this film.    I will STILL watch the 1951 Disney classic above  this one.    I had doubts when \\"Pocahontas\\" was released in 1995.  Turned out to be a great film.    This film is good NOT GREAT.  I have never read the Lewis Carroll book, just know the 1951 film.    Of course, we do NOT have songs in this 1.  You can always listen to the songs in the 1951 film.    Depp, he has done this type of role before, so this was no stretch for him.  Carter, Burton's girlfriend so that is how she keeps getting these parts in his film, good as the Red Queen.  The big head bit....with special effects the way the are today this effect should have been done better.  Hathaway needs Disney to get hit films.  OK job as the White Queen with no screen time till 2cd half of film.    Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum were a let down compared to the 1951 film.  All the animated characters NOT even close to the classic film.    The ending was bit of a let down.    NOW, I find myself having to say this with recent Disney DVD releases.  A line on the back of this DVD case describing the film \\"The extraordinary characters you've loved come to life richer and MORE COLORFUL THAN EVER\\".  OK, Disney, if you are prompting how the film looks then why are you guys resorting to PLAIN SILVER DVD' LIKE WHEN DVD'S CAME OUT IN THE LATE 1990'S?     No chapter search list or any information on film inside.    Disney has gone CHEAP & I just hate this.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|I had not intended to read the book until I saw so many one star ratings by people who had never read the book or those with permanently closed minds.  Not being a fan of closed minds, I decided to give it a try.  The book is an easy and well written read.<br />My only problem with the book was the appendix at the end rather than at the end of each chapter, but that is hardly a reason to downgrade.<br />Whether the author is or is not a Moslem is of no consequence.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable and a nice history lesson with insight into some troubled times.
B007FG9LIE|5|Every time I thought I knew where this was taking me, I was taken away deeper and deeper. I can't wait to start the next in the trilogy.
0062114042|4|Paul Stanley was (up until 2010) one of my favorite lead singers. I became a KISS fan during the mid 80s when he was apparently running the ship on his own. And while his other bandmates of the original 4 have told their story as they imagine it (well, Gene's got a wild imagination, Ace half remembers his past--better filled in by GG Gebert and Bob McAdams, and Peter imagines he can do no wrong), Paul stayed silent for the most part. Where Gene Simmons needs to constantly demand attention, Stanley is more of a private person. In Face The Music, Paul explains that his private nature stems from being born with microtia, which left him with one ear. The womanizing rockstar of KISS was an outcast among his peers as a kid. He had a dysfunctional home life and had to deal with depression. Music became his salvation and his drive combined with Gene Simmons' forged KISS. I expected comments on Ace and Peter, and as far as the anti semitism accusation, ummm...Paul, I saw you in Lydia Criss' book dressed in SS gear Ace bought. No dice. On the other hand, I would say he was brutally frank about how 2 guys who had great gifts musically let their drug habits come before the band. Paul laments Ace wasting his talents, and I think he pretty much is over Peter Criss. I wouldn't have put up with half the antics Peter pulled that Paul endured.He also gets into Gene Simmons piggybacking off his efforts to maintain KISS.  It's a good book, but there's glaring omissions--no discussion of when he did Live To Win, he doesn't honestly detail the fallout with Eric Carr around the time he was dying, and he just barely slams down Vinnie Vincent, who truly deserves having his treachery put on display. I do love his embracing fatherhood with his 4 kids. There were good moments overall, but there could have been more.
B00CH3DBNQ|5|tI really enjoyed this book.  Having lived in the Middle East for 2.5 years I understand the immense courage took it for this young lady to speak up.  She is very fortunate to have a father who supported and encouraged her.  I hope she can continue to be a mouthpiece for those children, especially girls around the world who have no voice.  I really had very little knowledge of the history of Swat Valley and found her story extremely insightful and informative as well as dramatic.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|Was fantastic.  Hope  EL James writes the next two as told by Christian.  I totally enjoyed<br /><br /> Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian ...<br /> E L James
0439023513|1|Like a lot of other reviewers I loved the first two books.  But this one felt vague and unfocused.  SPOILER ALERT. And what was the point of Prim's death?  She was the reason for Katniss' volunteering.  We already know war is awful so what purpose did Prim's death serve?  Maybe the point was to show that Katniss was the ultimate victim.  She ended up being used by everyone.  Wow, how uplifting.  This book destroyed the series for me.  All the strength in the first two books was gone.  This book was a letdown, very disappointing.
B00BFUUMO8|5|Great app, very easy to use and awesome to play. I love that you don't need to wait the full time to collect your money, you collect what is earned in the time waited instead of waiting. My one year old loves to collect the money and make the dinosaurs move. Awesome app, greatly recommended :)

1609611543|5|This book is direct about what to eat and what to avoid. It also explains how modern day wheat is a product of genetic modification. Dr. Davis advises readers to avoid wheat, and to also be careful with rice, corn, and potatoes. He points out that many gluten-free foods which use rice/corn to substitute for wheat can still cause big surges in blood sugar. He says legumes and fruit also need to be limited.<br />I had major blood sugar swings after eating starchy food (blood sugar went from 70 mg/dl before eating to 110 after eating and then down to 60 very rapidly), even though my glucose readings stayed within normal parameters. This blood sugar roller coaster ride had me feeling lightheaded and hungry all the time. Doctors told me to eat starch or sugar every two hours to keep my blood sugar up. I thought that was the way to go until I read this book.<br /> After two weeks of following the guidelines in this book, I can now go for hours without feeling hungry. No more dizzy spells. And I lost four pounds in two weeks.<br /> I still test my sugar regularly an hour or two after meals, and after giving up wheat and other grains/starchy vegetables, my numbers have stabilized.

0679457313|4|<br />  What Arundathi Roy has done in her fascinating book is capture the essence of the lives of a particular Syrian christian family set in a particular period and a place (a small Kerala town in the late 60s). Arundathi has put all the intricacies of the life of this family in a bottle, preserved it intact and released it in the form of a novel for universal consumption, much like a bottle of vanilla essence. I can see now why people react so differently to this book after reading it. Some people just do not like vanilla, some people think it is imitiation and others love it.  <br />  The accuracy of small things is mind boggling and maybe it is something which can truly be appreciated by someone who has lived through similar times in Kerala. Everything from the description of how the seats in the movie theatres (called talkies during that time) fold up, to the little ladle made of coconut shells, to the pride of the father whose son gets a double promotion, or the way the hindu wife addresses her husband, to the little song that the children sing when they row their boat across the river, or the starch in the shorts of the Kerala police that make them stand stiff, is absolutely right on the mark.  <br />  I applaud Arundathi Roy on her boldness, courage and perseverence to write this book. She handles delicate sexual topics with ease and confidence. Her unabashed use of Malayalam phrases (without translation) is a refreshing change from other Indian authors. She has spent great a effort in creating her own language for this book, sculpting words, chiselling them, putting them together until they are the right balance for her communication with the reader.  <br />    I can see some weaknesses as well in her book: Her characters lack real depth. She is exquisite in describing the exterior appearances of a character but not as complete with thier mental or emotional makeup. When a character is faced with a particular situation we are told what the emotional response is to that situation without much of explanation of why it was that response.  None of the characters have any redeeming qualities which makes the book a little unrealistic.  Failures in professional and marital life abound in each character.  <br />  Overall, I would say this is a must read.

B00D7Z4GQY|4|Normally I know early in a read what will unfold and the enjoyment comes from excellence in prose.<br />The  secret was a total surprise.  The descriptive passages of emotion and action were very good.
B0029XFNAI|5|love this movie!
B00T47ZXIE|4|I'm glad I saw it but I wouldn't buy it.
B001FB4W0W|5|I love this series I just started getting into this show and have finish watching the first season. To my understanding this show is based off a book which I did not know and had a following before the series. What I love about the first season it introduces you to each of the main characters and you get to know them even though there is still some mystery to each characters. And I LOVE LAFAYETTE and of course every one else. Get for a collection and would recommend for a collection.
B0013LL2Z2|5|Keeping in mind when this movie was made -- back before the age of computer generated whiz bang special effects, this movie presents a &#34;future world&#34; where population is controlled and manipulated by technology.
B000001FMX|5|Ok, heres a rub. I have the ORIGINAL VINYL tucked away very carefully. BOTH albums are in PERFECT condition....Pulled both out the other night, looked over the album jackets, yes I have those too, and cranked up the ole B&O turntable. My Polk Audio LSi-15s screamed out Bad Detective, as I was taken back to the summer of my youth......I loved these guys back then, and I still love them now. Ahead of thier time. Glad to hear the last surviving members, (2), played @ the Filmore the other night. From the press release they received a warm and well deserved welcome back.... <br /> <br />Buy it, just buy it....You youngsters out there, sick of all the crap out there? Take a tip from a Geezer, heres what it was really like back when the music wasnt dead & lipsynchers were laughed off stage......
B004HX0P2Y|5|thanks
B00H58VGIA|5|I highly recommend tis book to anyone interested in historical fiction. To find out in the end that the main characters of Sarah and her sister were real and much of the story was based on their actual accomplishments really impressed me. I really enjoyed this book.
B00KQFXODY|4|Really good movie! Much better than I expected. Story line was much better than the original and the action as very good. Samuel Jackson's part was one I didn't like but he does a great job as always.
0790743213|4|North by Northwest is very exciting and suspensfull movie. Throughtout the whole entire movie it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen next to Roger Thornhill. I'm not one for old fashion movies but this one I would deffinately recommend to anyone who enjoys a good suspensfull movie. It kind of reminded me of I Know What You Did Last Summer, but in an older sense. The movie itself starts out with a man named Roger Thornhill who gets kidnapped from an important dinner meeting. Roger is taken to a secluded house where these man are calling him by the name of George Kaplin. They refuse to believe him of his true name they get him drunk and put him in a stolen car and try to drive him off of a cliff. Roger came to just as the car was going over and lead the killers on a chase throughout the town. Roger is stopped by the police and taken to jail for being drunk and for stealing a car. The police find his story a lie. The next day Roger and his mother went with some detectives to that sane house and the woman there just made up a lie that she had a party and Roger left was there and left drunk. He was so furious that he then went on a chase to find this George Kaplin fellow to whom he supposedly resembled. On his journey he runs into many people and many more problems. He also gets considered a murderer when a man he is talking to gets stabbed with a knife. While on his journey he runs into a woman named Eve. She seems very nice and even helps Roger out even though she knows what he is really considered. She lies to protect him from the police. Later in the movie you will find what Eve's real position is in the situation. Roger falls in love with Eve and keeps tracking her down all the way to the end of the movie where he ends up saving her. Eve acts as though she wants to help Roger but in reality she is trying to help the killers get him. In the end it ends up that Eve works for the F.B.I. and she is their secrete tip on to what is going on with Vandam's deals.The whole time that Roger is running from the police the F.B.I. is following him and Eve. Which leads them to catching Vandam and his men. In my opinion the ending of the movie was dumb but I guess if you look at the ways movies used to end that was what the people wanted to see. For those people that like to have happy endings at the end of all movies this is a good one for you but even if you don't like happy endings the suspense to the end is enough to keeping you watching. I enjoyed this movie overall and I hope that you have too or else you will enjoy it in the near future.
B00005JLKN|5|If you are a fan of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" this movie is a must-see. In \\"Red Dragon\\" we see how Hannibal Lecter was actually caught at the beginning of the original film and why he is in prison. This film is a prequel to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" as we get the back story on the cinema's most vicious villin. Anthony Hopkins, as usual, is fantastic as Lecter, but it is Ralph Fiennes who steals this film. Like the original film \\"The Red Dragon\\" has two stories running concurrently: not only are we treated to a great story on Lecter, but another serial killer mastermind is murdering people called The Tooth Fairy, played by Fiennes. It is up to a smart FBI agent, played by Edward Norton, to catch this maniac. Ralph Fiennes gives the greatest performance of his career in this movie, as we see the tortured life he leads, as he was abused by his horrific grandmother who is not seen on film; only her voice is heard in flashbacks. The voice is none other than Ellen Burstyn. Just hearing the grandmother's voice yelling at her grandson gives the audience the background on what eventually made this murderer; there is always a reason behind the behavior. Emily Watson has a supporting role, playing a blind woman who befriends the Fiennes evil character. Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a journalist who gets caught and tortured by the Tooth Fairy. I won't tell you what happens to his character!<br /> The DVD is in widescreen format, the trailer is included, there is commentary by director Brett Ratner and writer Ted Tally who wrote the original film, there is a great profile on Hannibal Lecter, deleted scenes, and much more. An excellent film that was a huge hit at the boxoffice. Time magazine calls the movie \\"brilliantly darkly seductive!\\".
B004QZ9PLU|5|This book was a great read. I enjoyed the characters especially when they reconnected after so many years apart. The ending was strong and made me love Nicholas Sparks and his books even more!
B00BLCHYKU|5|Excellent series!!!!
B005HSL626|5|Both my daughter and I enjoy playing this game.  We actually compete against each other to see who has the higher score.
B00002N9ER|5|I have looked everywhere for these Maglite D-Cell wall clamps to put in our new RV so we could mount our flashlight by the door!  Love that I was able to get them here and the price was not bad either!
B00CL0J99K|2|Just because Iron Man 1 & 2 were awesome (thank you to JON FAVREAU for THAT), doesnt mean that SHANE BLACK is ANY GOOD at directing nor writing.<br /><br />Which he CLEARLY wasnt.<br /><br />This movie sucked SO BAD.<br /><br />Dont believe the trailers nor Box Office $$$ count. It sucks all around. Iron Man 2 is the 2nd greates movie of all time (as far as I'm concerned), and IM 1 came in 4th, right behind Avengers. IM3 is WAY DOWN, not even in the TOP 10 ! ! !<br /><br />Quality, Story, Ending.... THEY ALL SUCKED ! ! !<br /><br />Acting: No Complaints. Which means it was ALL SHANE BLACKS FAULT ! ! !<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Worth watching? (for FREE) - YES.<br />Watching in theatre? - NO.<br /><br />Worth buying on DVD? - Probably Not.<br />Worth buying on Blu-Ray? - HELL NO ! ! !
B003L7861E|3|2.5 stars really - can't believe they made a movie
0393035158|5|Over the past three years (not to mention the last few blood-soaked millennia) it has become blatantly clear that the greatest source of evil in history lies in the blind pursuit of organized, religious faith.   Any time a specific group is told \\"You are the chosen people,\\" this may provide comfort for the \\"chosen\\" group, but it will invariably cause problems for people who are deemed \\"unchosen\\".  Sam Harris' book points out that not only is the world teeming with people for whom their faith is an absolute, unquestionable truth, but that nearly every single one of these religious orders deems it necessary to either eradicate or convert non-believers to affirm their allegience to that faith.  Mr. Harris points out that, at the core of these popular faiths, there is no allowance for discussion, reason, dissention or even metaphorical interpretation.  Does it come as a surprise to anyone that people are recularly being destroyed in horrific ways to further these fantastical beliefs?  As the book also astutley points out, there is a built-in societal abhorrance to even discuss an individual's personal religious faith, let alone question their right to beleive, even if that belief is leading the world into horrific tragedy.  This must be addressed.  It is time for a new age of enlightened reason.  There is no more important issue facing us today:  Will we rise to challenge the warped precepts set forth by the ancient and uninformed peoples of an ancient world, or will we continue to allow many thousands of innocents  to be killed in mass numbers by those that feel they are doing \\"God's work\\"?  <br /> <br />Until Sam Harris' book, I have never seen this case put forward so clearly and reasonably. I urge everyone to pick up this book and truly think about its implications.  And as you think about the situation, think about the bravery it takes to face religious zealotry in all its forms, and send Mr. Harris a note of thanks for his fine work. <br /> <br /> <br />
0547564651|5|I have not read the entire book yet; it contains so much thought-provoking information that I am taking notes and working my way through all the research-based information it contains. As a teacher for many years, I have come to believe that I can have a positive difference in how they learn and succeed, but there is so much more that influences what they accomplish. This book is packed with valuable information! I would recommend as a book to read for everyone who works with children and everyone who raises a child.
B00QLVY7J2|1|It isa fun game save for the greed of its developers! All they care abut is selling game objects. You may win in the short term but you'll be gone in 3 months. We players were borned at night but not last night!
B004H4XDBI|4|Good sequel to If I Stay. Only thing that it could have had a better ending. It seems like the author had to end the book in a hurry.
B007SGM084|1|horrible! i couldn't even get through the first one. i wish you could return ebooks.
B002QE3CTY|5|An amazing read! I couldn't put it down! I loved the suspense and imagery the author painted!

B004HNTER6|5|To quote Top Gear, which stole a march on this kid and wrote exactly what I would've penned after a screening of '[[ASIN:B004OBQQPY Senna]],' \\"The year after [the tragic death of Formula 1 superstar Ayrton Senna], Spanish actor Antonio Banderas was set to play [the Brasilian driver] in a $100m Hollywood bio-pic. Of course, it never happened, and now it never will. With the release of 'Senna,' a feature-length documentary about arguably the greatest and certainly the most charismatic racing driver of all time, the real story has been told. Definitively, thrillingly and with real emotion.<br /><br />Big movies usually follow a three-act narrative arc and Senna's life lends itself naturally to that. It opens with never-before-seen footage of him karting in Brazil, and reaches a mesmerising and moving climax with the dreadful events at Imola in May 1994. In between, Senna's racing career unfolds in a way that even the most optimistic Hollywood screenwriter would scarcely have dared imagine. It's all here: the first glimmers of genius, the ascent to greatness, the period of domination, the bitter rivalries and intense politicking, disillusion and dismay, flawed heroism, the final grim chapter.\\"<br /><br />Please don't be led astray by any 1, 2, or even 3-star reviews. 'Senna' is a spectacular film and a moving and dramatic work of art that honors Senna the man and satisfies the yearnings of his fans to reconnect with a sporting god, while still respecting his memory and treating with dignity Ayrton's family and friends, colleagues and even rivals. I'm not ashamed to admit that the funeral coverage moved me to tears...<br /><br />\\"The circumstances of Senna's demise are as chilling as ever. The feeling that he somehow knew something terrible was going to befall him is inescapable. But in the midst of the tragedy, the film strives for an elegiac note and achieves it. Formula One still misses Ayrton Senna but this is an appropriate memorial.\\"<br /><br />'[[ASIN:B004OBQQPY Senna]]' - buy it and enjoy. But make sure that whatever format you're purchasing it in will play on your hardware!make sure that whatever format you're purchasing it in will play on your hardware!
B004UID2LC|2|I simply could not get the program to work for me and finally after several attempts I removed the program from my Kindle.
B008Y78M60|4|Good history lesson.  Well done.
B00KD97I80|4|Really enjoyed this version. The graphics were good and was stuck a few times.
B007HACDLK|5|A friend gave me one of Vince Flynn's books and after finishing it, I was hooked.  I did not read them in order as I requested them from the library; and they all came in at different times and had different copyrights.  But I loved them. I have since got my sister and brother-in-law hooked as well.  They have listened to the audio books and they are great.  I bought &#34;Last Man&#34; because I could not wait to get it from the library.  It is wonderful.  Mr Flynn, I hope you are reading this cause I need you to be writing some more great stories for Mitch Rapp.  Keep up the amazing writing!!
B00BVYNSLC|5|You just keep wanting to watch the next episode!
B000Q6GUW0|5|This is one of the most imaginative, and creative shows I have seen in a while.  I love this show, I love Michael C Hall as Dexter, and everything about this show.  The pacing, the acting, the writing, music, everything, nothing is bad about this show.<br /><br />I watched Season 1 as it aired on TV (I read Jeff's book first, then again at the end of the season)  And they match each other well.  I was lucky to watch this in HD, but I was growing impatient to watch this show again (as I deleted them from my TiVo).  When the dvds came out, I watched the whole set again.  Just recently, I watched the dvds again, followed by watching season 2 off my TiVo.<br /><br />Season 1 follows the book, not exactly, but to an extent.  It makes a great first season.  I fell in love with this show at first airing.  Anyone I show this to, loves it.  I do not wish to spoil anything, just note, it does get better in season 2!  Also buffy fans should be happy to know Julie Benz plays a fantastic role in this show.<br /><br />I rate this show a 5, it may not be a 5, but my blind love for this show prevents me from finding any faults, it is that good.<br /><br />I rate the dvds a 3 out of 5 (thats being polite).<br /><br />The video quality on this show is about a 3.  Showtime / CBS / Paramount fail to realize this show is 50-60 minutes in length, and cram too many episodes on each disc.<br /><br />Audio 4 out of 5, as with all showtime / cbs / paramount dvds, the default audio is stereo, you need to change it to dolby digital.  Also, no subtitles, only closed captioning (great if you are watching this on a \\"tv\\", I'm using an HDTV \\"monitor\\" which has no closed captioning.<br /><br />Extras, 2 commentary's, one with cast, one with the producers, the one with the producers is really good, and you should check it out.  They also have a bonus feature, which covers how they use blood splatter in real cases, which is nice.  I give this a 3.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Season 2 follows its on path, and tells a new original tale.  Hopefully this will continue with further seasons.  I eagerly await Season 3, and future books, you cannot go wrong with this.<br /><br />also, please make sure prior to starting to watch this, you alot the time available to view it in its entirety.  Especially if it is your first time, it is so addicting, you cannot step away from the TV, when this show aired on TV it drove me crazy, awaiting each week.  Trust me, it is THAT good.  Thats why I refused to watch any of season 2, and just Tivo'ed them, and waited until the season finale to watch it in its entirety.d tells a new original tale.

B0062NAX1U|5|Love this movie, great faith-based movie with real life scenarios and awesome Godly responses.  God is love, and we are called to love those who make bad choices.
B0044C3RB4|5|So good.
B0010V4TZU|4|I went to high school with the keyboardist, Rostam. I knew he was talented, but wow. A-Punk is good, but Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa is unlike anything I've heard. Buy this album, you won't be dissapointed.
B0089OBLDO|5|Works great had friends over an used his xbox/PC controller without a hitch. Only thing I noticed is with 4 people on black opps 2 can get a lil laggy. Not Sure if the adapter is to blame or the ps3. Either way it does it's job well very pleased.

B00004ZB9D|3|If you've ever found yourself listening to Lenny's songs on the radio and said (hey I like this song, but I don't want to buy the album) or if you've ever listened to a car commercial and sung along the chorus, then this is the album for you. There are some good cuts on this album like &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; among others, but I just gave this album three stars because it isn't something I would purchase. I guess I'm a very very casual fan ;-)
B00KR4WWBO|5|Very good scanner
B004529NLG|4|It is another good dance movie and I like how it has some of the original actors and actresses bu nothing is the same as the first few. I have to admit though I love how it was clear and didn't know how a dance movie would pull off 3D but nailed it perfectly!
B00005QXDD|4|tenacious d is the greatest rock band of their genre and this album as a whole is a masterpiece, but after time it loses its appeal and if you take any of the tracks away from the whole they suffer,also not that it matters but because of all the cussing you really cant play anywhere outside the privacy of your own vehicle oe residence but their all minor details,so if you want a good rock band with a ittle comedy and you dont mind foul language than this cd is for you.
B005ERYEGU|5|Great book
0312567448|5|Once I started reading this delightful book, I couldn't put it down. It sheds light on the private lives of such great men as Benjamin Disraeli and Pierre Curie -- who knew they were such romantics?    The book made me wish that I live the pre-email era where men actually wrote lengthy, sincere and effusive letters to the women they love. The only downside to this collection is that it sets the bar high (perhaps too high?) for my husband...        The only pitfall
B008Y212PI|4|Despite having only 1 color, I really enjoy this app! I think the ability to &quot;blast&quot; any unwanted blocks is a big plus. I don't like that you automatically see your mistakes, but otherwise very good!
B009LDD54K|5|The third season was well worth watching but I prefer the first two.  Still, there is nothing quite like it produced for tv or dvd and I totally enjoy the way it is put together.
B004W1GCNC|3|Interesting characters, in interesting situations.  A diversion from all the crime shows and sports.  Six more words are required?  Um... does um count?
B004GJDQT8|5|You get your products on time and the quality of the merchandise is excellent.  Thank you Amazon the price is right.
1419702238|5|Awesome! It is a great book and my grandchildren just cant stop reading it! I reccomend it to all children who can read!
B009NPKTN6|3|Amusing but forgettable. It had a very predictable plot.  I fell asleep half way through the movie and didn't miss anything.
B004UJAOLM|5|It is great to reread the classics I read in high school.  The pain that people bring upon themselves and each other by holding onto real and imagined slights never change.  Bronte story of self absorbed people of means, living only to fulfill their own petty desired at the expense around them led to a generation of early deaths and daily misery.
B000N4SHPS|5|Rocky Balboa is the best.  This movie will make you cry.  Even if your not a Rocky or Sly fan, you will like this.  Good for Sly to finish the series in this way.
B004L49K20|5|This album, \\"All You Need Is Now\\", is a return-to-roots triumph for Duran Duran; a precious gift to us fans; a quintessential revelation to casual listeners; and a major slap in the face to their former label Sony/Epic Records!
B0068853O6|2|OK
B00C8RDSWK|5|Cute movie.  Not too much violence like some kids movies.  Sweet theme.  Funny and entertaining.  We've watched several times already.
B003YFIUW8|3|It took me awhile to get use to the 5 year old narrator, but it was worth the read. Great survival story.
0152465073|1|I bought this book looking for the Katherine Woods translation... Heads: this isn't it! The print quality of the illustrations is pretty substandard too.
B008AK8FHM|4|This was one of the most fascinating books I have  ever read.<br /> It is a comforting book if you have recently lost someone and it's a reminder that we are all connected.
B001OFJPIS|5|I love Ron Perlman and his nonchalant attitude.<br />Also Del Toro is one of the best directors of this century
B005LAIIRQ|1|It can take only one movie that will turn me away from ever watching the actor in anything else.  For Liam Nielsen this is it.  This film represents the arrogant point of view of the U.S. secular film industry as art. The idea that meaningful dialogue always has to include the 'F' word is demeaning itself as a filler for an abject poverty of dialogue.  Only in the 21st century has cursing considered part of literature.  Corse language demeans literature.  Any actor that considers it art is not an artist.  This film also represents the secular Hollywood philosophy.  Life sucks and then you die while cursing God.  I would rather call this movie a \\"Wolf's Free Lunch in Alaska\\".  Oh by the way if Hollywood wants to take artist license with the difference between day and night in wilderness of Alaska that's okay by me.  In the winter most of the day its dark, in summer most of the day is light. Do not watch this movie if you are seeking the meaning of life.  It is not entertainment; it's garbage.
B007THA4FI|5|This was a great book with unusual characters whose ages ranged from teens to 70s. It was a different kind of mystery that held my attention throughout.
B0030ZOYHC|5|I never watched the original Evangelion because the artwork looked outdated, but the &#34;re-make&#34; into blu-ray made it worth watching and purchasing to add to my collection of anime.
B001NLL93W|5|I already have the books but I enjoy doing reading through phone so purchased the book for Kindle it is a great read and keeps you very entertained. I definitely recommend reading the series and it will be a big movie production like the Harry Potter series possibly.
B001U887R4|5|purchased for my husband, after he coveted my mammoths. He loves them and wears them continually...  this is a high testosterone biker, hunter guy who also likes his comfort.  The service from Amazon was great, fast and efficient.  Thanks.
B00846TTDG|3|Good movie, I would recommend it.  Acting not the best.  Action was believeable and pretty good.  Good suspense throughout.  I would pay to see it in theatres.
B003H4I4JU|3|It's got some interesting Twists on the plot but it's not as good as Enders game. I nor sure how the movies are going to come round to tell this tale
B006RUJST6|5|This book was captivating from the beginning..such a sweet, heart-warming story about family, life and love. I purchased Point of Retreat the second I finished this one.
0385335482|4|I am the main character, Becky Bloomwood!  The way she justifies all of her extravagant purchases.....I related.  This book had some very humorous financial situations that many of us have found ourselves in.  For those that shop, for those that browse, and for those that just want a quick read and a good laugh.....this is the book for you.
1449433251|5|The most whimsical and delightful collection ever! Great for any age. I read this whenever I need to decompress or need a good laugh, and it never fails me.
630521610X|5|Scream is the 2nd best horror movie ever made, and almost as good as Halloween. It is definetly the most original horror movie ever, great acting, superb story, lots of gore but not enough to make it stupid. Scream rocks you should definetly buy it, don't rent it!!!
B00499NHLC|5|In a nutshell, Sherlock is brilliant. The dialogue is masterfully written and spectacularly delivered especially by the protagonist and his sidekick. They have such a natural chemistry that can't be faked that the view can't help but fall in love with the both of them. Big props to the casting of this whole show. The modern cinematography is very tastefully executed. Just the nature having an hour and a half of time for each episode allows for so much more character development and hilarious situations different characters find themselves in. In short, I highly recommend watching this, but only if you have a good amount of self control and can afford to watch an entire 90min episode.
B009RX7IX8|5|This show 'Castle' is the best TV show that they have come out with in a Very Long Time. It gives you the suspense, murder and intrigue and offers some fun as well. The actors do a great job with their parts. Everyone should watch this show at least once. I prefer watching 'Castle' over other shows that they put out for TV.
1845767055|5|Absolutely fantastic book. I'm a big fan of sci-fi, fantasy, and WH40k art; and this book has it all! Thank you Paul Bonner!
037571457X|5|It is really good item. I am satisfied with this purchase.
B007C12RDS|5|Enjoyable period piece. Excellent acting, lovely setting, convincing costumes. Set in English countryside, you slowly learn about each of the main characters. If you like series like Call the Midwife, The London, or Downton Abby, you should enjoy this.
B005MLOKXA|5|Well written and how long with in good variety of topics makes is a very enjoyable show
B0060FXDCG|3|Loved the show have all seasons, watched the show many times. Loved to watch it on my amazon prime and DVDs
B001DSNEJM|5|GREAT MOVIE
0790729725|3|Goodfellas has to be one of the great Mob movies ever, alongside the Godfather and Godfather II. However the DVD isn't all that great, mainly due to the utter lack of extras on it.<br />If you HAVE to have this movie, then I suggest you go ahead and get it. Other wait for a Special Edition to come out, which hopefully will come soon.
B00005B1W7|3|I am only giving this 3 stars simply because we have not watched it yet and are not likely to in the near future.  We have seen this mini-series several times in the past and were greatly impressed.  The dvd appears to be as good as advertised in terms of condition, but<br />we cannot rate it fully and honestly.
0802130208|5|Over time, every one who is literate will get their hands on this literary marvel and rejoice! i just wish he could have been here to hear our congratulations. Brilliant!<br />Dr. John LoRe
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is so fun and it is like flappy bird, but flappy bird is out of the appstore. But I love this game as much as I love flappy bird.
B00L6Z2VPU|4|This novella continues the story of Dragos and Pia and adorable Peanut.  A quick read that adds to the overall story.  It also sets up a thread of what could happen if Dragos' memory doesn't completely return.  LOVE dragons and unicorns.
B00005QIPH|5|It's pretty sad that most of the people who give this album a bad review just make some weak comparison to VU or some other band and say that The Strokes are not original. I can only assume that these people have not heard either VU, The Strokes, or possibly either band, or are nu metal fans bitter at their ... genre's demise and have come here to bring down others.<BR>I was somewhat skeptical about The Strokes at first, seeing them for the first time on MTV and then reading about their priviliged backgrounds. But then I pulled my head out of my ... and realized that it didn't matter how I heard of them or how rich their parents are, they make damn good music. Yes, some of it's poppy and catchy, but some of it is also raw, balls out rock and roll. Just listen to BARELY LEGAL and TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT a couple times. Keep an open mind and you'll find yourself liking them too.<BR>I would say the most impressive aspect of this album, besides it being an incredibly fun listen, is how well crafted the songs are. They each play fairly simple parts, but they fit together in such a way and change often enough that it doesn't get old or stale. The simplicity of this album is, oddly enough, just amazing. (This coming from someone who is a big fan of Radiohead and At The Drive-In, which is saying a lot if you know anything about those bands)<BR>I am one of those people who prides himself on keeping his ear to the ground in the music scene and hearing and knowing about the indie and lesser known bands (someone people might refer to as a \\"music snob\\") because I am not happy with most of the crap on MTV or the radio.  However, I also realize that sometimes it is ok, and maybe even good, to listen to music just for the sake of pure mindless fun. Which one reason why I love The Strokes.<br />p.s. the material for The Strokes' second album is shaping up quite nicely (good luck making comparisons so VU now)<br />p.p.s. Interpol's debut album Turn On The Bright Lights is just damn good
B00HY7YXIM|5|I love the &#34;common&#34; mind of the white queen! Very bright and has loving moves and advice for h and with her husband.

B003L20IJM|5|Love Nanny McPhee movies.  Hope they make another one soon.  Loved the ending of this movie.  Love that it is a clean family movie.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great fun long lasting, full of updates for the seasons, not had to pay for a thing. I love hidden object games this one.this one  fits the bill.Great fun long lasting. Enjoy so much I had to share .
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Hopefully it stays consistent and no crazy quests. Like having multiple tasks to complete. Just wish selling/buying crops was closer to my level, most items to buy crops are locked and the ones I'm selling linger too long.
B008JFUQ16|5|I LOVE this movie- It is adorable for both adults and children. My four year old loves it as well.
0785134352|4|After watching the special features on Kick-Ass, I knew I wanted to read the comic, that went from comic to screen play so fast, as in before the comic was complete (3/8 of the way). As dark as the movie is... the comic is darker.    I am a fan of both the movie and the book, They were different. And it was interesting to see what they changed from the comic. (red mist is just one example)
B004L3AQFG|4|127 Hours is one of the better movies I have seen in the last few years. A climber falls and gets his arm stuck. He can't free himself and the film shows his experiences over 127 hours of agony. It never gets boring, manages to tell a simple but believable story and allows you to empathize with the main character's plight. Camp and comedy are avoided here in favor of an effectively dramatic performance about one man's ordeal. What struck me was how easily anyone can relate to this situation in some way. I'm surprised more people haven't rated and reviewed this little gem. It got 6 Oscar nominations but only managed to break even at the box office. The picture and audio quality are superb in this release. There is 103 minutes of bonus content.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/MPEG-4 AVC   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround<br />Special Features: Audio Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending, Featurettes, Short Film, Digital Copy<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B0050DIWFC|5|I was quite surprised by the turn of events and blown away with the ending. I never imagined what was to come. I REALLY liked this book. I could relate with the father wanting to do whatever he had to defend his son, who is accused of murder. Being a prosecutor, he knew the ins and outs of the legal system and it was quite interesting. Legal thrillers are my absolute favorite and Defending Jacob is a good one. It was never boring and kept me wanting more until the end. Then I was just like WOW!
B0007O38F8|1|50 man, you should wait for Dr. Dre man, you put an album like that man, that most be a joke man. Or I am still dreaming. 50 you rushed the album out man, and you are not even 3 stars from our reviews man... I am not hitting on you 50, but this is not hip-hop, Piggy bank is called out war man...! Please take Banks, Yayo, and Buck out of the hate it or love it, man leave it for Game son, they suck on it man... Wow, 50 I don't know which song that should be something to listen everyday man, because like their said before all sound the same, and you are not a boss, pretend to be are not a boss, wait for Dr. Dre to create what we call out real beats for you and then you rap, on track. The Game killed you man... This is album is dope even you running your little mouth, you wrote most of those songs, but The Game got a better chemestry than you 50 Cent, call JMJ again 50, asked him for a new way to rap son! I am fan in all man but this is not a G-unit album...
B00AB0AXU6|5|I recommend this movie
B000K7VHQ4|5|Based on Steven Millhauser's short story \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\", the film takes place in the early 1900's in Vienna when a young magician falls in love with a girl, Sophie, from a higher social class. They are separated and they spend years without seeing each other. One night, Eisenheim is onstage performing an illusion and requires someone from the crowd to assist him. To his great surprise, Sophie climbs onstage but she doesn't recognize him at first. Eisenheim learns that she is engaged to a prince who has a reputation for not being the nicest man around women. Something will happen that will change the course of things and will put Eisenheim against the prince and his trusty inspector.<br /><br />The Illusionist is certainly one of 2006's best films. I went in to see this movie not knowing what to expect -- having stopped myself from seeing any trailers or TV spots. It's a wonderful film that pulls you in from the first frame. The cinematography is beautiful and the score haunting. Norton, Biel, and Giamatti all give stellar performances.<br /><br />This was director Neil Burger's second film; his first being Interview with the Assassin, a mockumentary on the Kennedy assassination which I have yet to see. I'm curious as what he'll do next; his screenwriting and directing skills impressed me with The Illusionist.<br /><br />This is the kind of film which I can safely say will appeal to almost anyone. It has a great plot, compelling characters, and a clever ending. Whether you like drama, suspense, or fantasy, I think you'll find a bit of everything in this movie. Highly recommended!
B007PTJOV0|5|just like. Mario brothers but a silly leprevhan. its fun yo play and I recommend it to any and all. enjoy it
B004PYDBVM|5|An engaging story, well-written, I couldn't put it down. The author's story is fascinating in the depravity and utter abuse he and his family suffered.

B00DYOOGYK|2|I've noticed that it crashes is slow and is very very glitchy and freezes.  Graphic are horrible.
B000001ELD|3|At the time this came out I liked it ok.  As the years went by I grew to hate it.  But now I've come full circle.  For what the band was going through it really wasn't that bad of an effort from Gene.  He stays true to his beliefs and gives us a decent set of songs.
B00EKR61FM|5|Son perfectos *0*
B00004I9VE|4|Every since he was a little boy, he's lived his life on on stage, on camera and in front of the worlds collective eyes. He dreamed about recording a legendary album. He succeeded. What more can be said about the accomplishments of Michael Jackson, that have been left unsaid? The man has thrilled the world for well over forty years, sold millions, become wealthy and through his music has been able to live out a fantasy life. <br /> <br />But this review is about Thriller the album and I will speak on that. It seems every generation (twenty) years or so an artists catches the world absolutely sleeping and pulls our collective conscience in with their social commentary put on vinyl, CD, or tape. Thriller is the biggest selling album of all time (60 million copies) and still selling as of today's count. If I could find a word to describe that kind of a feat, I would readily use it but, I justt cannot. Humans do not sell records, at least not to that degree. No artist in music history has ever had a solo album come near that monstrous, totally unbelievable sales count. This album skyrocketed Michael Jackson into an orbit I don't think another musician will ever reach. Before Thriller, in terms of popularity I would say Elvis was the most popular musician of all time. But, I think its become abundantly clear when you sell 300 million records as a solo artists and have the abillity to sell out arenas in both Indian, and New York City on three consecutive nights. That is impact. Not to mention 12 golden statues sitting in Europe right now reverring Jacksons image. Its safe to say he was larger than life, no entertainer has had more impact on the art of music overall than Michael Jackson. It was the first time an African-american REALLY achieved ultra cross-over and transatlantic success. Michael Jackson is the most worshipped and reverred musical artists that has ever lived. White kids bought and cried over his album (Both men and women). He won 8 grammy awards, defied thelaws of physics with the Moonwalk on Motown 25th anniversay special. <br /> <br />I like to call Jackson the \\"Jackie Robinson\\" of the MTV generation because he came along at a time where MTV was in its infant stages, and were all Jim Crow about playing black artists. This album made it OK for future artists to have a chance on the once white predominated channel. Prince, Madonna, Usher, everyone is still doing the same numbers Jackson did in terms of video. His creative genuis has sparked something, nobody in music had seen before. Sure, as we sit back now and watch music videos as they are, we are hardly impressed because everyone is moderately speaking still doing the same thing. But in the 1980's, music videos with stories and plots were unheard of. Some would say a lot of things led to the unfathomable, success Thriller had, good PR, marketing, MTV (just coming out), and Quincy Jones and Michael Jacksons just musical chemistry. All of this is correct and all of this created an album of such magnitude, in which is highly likely we'll never see anything like it again. Do I feel Thriller will be outsold eventually? It has been the biggest selling album since 1985 when it went into the world records. Thats twenty years. I think another record may come close due to over population. But seeing how we have so many music download programs that we didnt have in the 80's, I dont think Thriller will ever be surpassed. <br /> <br />Its been twenty years since Jackson became a legend. Where's the next biggest musical act on the planet at? <br /> <br /> <br />
B001PPGAIA|1|Second DVD delivered to my home address in Spain which does not play in this region.   Amazon agreed to my returning same.   As a dummy I had not realised about the regional playing, which I would have thought Amazon would have picked up?
6303965415|5|This 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is subtle and understated and simply superb.  Amanda Root is a perfect Anne Elliott; faded and overlooked at the beginning.  You can see just how much she's let herself go, even with the stooped stature and limp hair.  And you feel the mortification, along with her, when her former fiance, Capt. Wentworth, dashingly played by Ciaran Hinds, sees her in this state.  <BR>The movie does move rather slowly, but this is it's power.  Even the score of piano music by Chopin conveys how slowly and heavily the time has moved for Anne.  And once you see the transformation that occurs, physically, for Anne, it's even easier to understand how re-awakened hope has transformed her spiritually.  <BR>One big difference is the director's use of BOTH the endings Austen wrote to illustrate Frederick's dilemma.  And the ending is one of the most romantic scenes I've ever watched.  <BR>I highly recommend it to devotees of Jane Austens's work.

B00000490M|5|This is one of the few martial arts movies where you can say it has become a cultural classic.<br /><br />The story is compelling, it contains a strong plot, and also has somewhat of a moral to the story. It is generally realistic and the actors seem comfortable in their roles. It generally seems very genuine, except for the part when Miagi jumps the boys who are beating up on Daniel--that part feels a bit artificial.<br /><br />The actor playing Miagi does an EXCELLENT job. He is definately the crown gem of this film and without him it would not be what it is.<br /><br />This film has inspired and given hope to many a young wimp.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Great plot well written as usual
B000R7HY0K|4|They sell the movies separately yet they were in theaters together.  Besides the point, this movie drags on until the last scene when Kurt Russell races the three girls.  I liked it but not my favorite.
B004H6G0TI|4|This game would be fun if i could figure out how not to crash right away.  The graphics are great and the controls are easy but I just never could get the hang of it.
B000SEGMAU|5|I'm so thankful that this book was an assigned class reading. It told of great life lessons, held a tremendous  amount of wisdom and oozed of love. This is truly a great read, and a great life lesson!
B00338QENI|5|This is a must read for every woman, not only for the history and medical information, but for how important it is to take charge of your medical care.  Henrietta contributed so much to science without ever knowing.  God bless her.
B006MW3UZW|5|I am dying for season 4. It made me want to have tea and crumpets with gloves on! My Lady :)
B00D7OMNXS|5|seeing this in the theaters is only a little better than this Blue-ray with the sound cranked up.  Fun movie and well done.  The Blue-ray arrived quickly and in perfect shape.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Great game!!! Love the challenges and quest. Also love the fact that I don't have to use my money to advance... hate that I have to wait half a day to recharge the energy tho
B000JMKTLO|5|I do not know where she gets her story line but it is good and hard.  It was a hard read but a good book!

B004O3YGMC|5|Not sure of the full capabilities of something like this, but it is so very handy!<br />You can do everything on there (in the limits of what i do) with you phone from far away.<br />I use my computer for music with spotify and use my phone to control it from afar during parties.
0439023491|5|I loved these books.  I never saw the movie but I could not put these books down.  The second was a little slow I thought but on a whole very enjoyable.
B003NRYMZQ|4|I knew nothing about this show before watching the first episode.  It held my interest through the first episode, the only one I had time to watch.  I'd call it sci-fi lite.  I normally don't like British shows, but I did enjoy this one.
B005CGI4EG|5|Okay, only three seasons of the set have the 'Love & Marriage' opening song on their tracks, cheap, cheap, production company to not pay for it to be on all seasons DVD's, however, anytime you can pick up a DVD set that is over 5000 minutes for $40, what I picked it up for, pick it up!
B00GUO2SKA|4|yes, see why he won the oscar
B004R2DS9C|5|I think I love this box more than my son does.  It makes clean up very easy. He hasn't used the play mat aspect of it as much yet but I think he will as he gets into Star Wars more.
B005544V6A|5|After finally giving the show a chance midway through its second season, I got hooked so badly that I actually paid to watch all the episodes I missed in one marathon viewing. Love it when things get &#34;lippy.&#34;
B003SH6GEG|2|It is the only DVD I could find of the movie. Asian subtitles for dialog through the whole movie is less than fun. Horrible video transfer. I owned the Laser Disc (remember them) and remember the movie just being gorgeous on that format. Too bad because I still really like the movie. I have to think if it didn't get transferred to Blu Ray yet it never will.
B009XIXVU6|5|Another great engaging story by a great author . He transports you to another country and another time with characters that engage you
6305428387|5|I miss John Candy!  This is just a fun movie about an &#34;almost&#34; tragedy in the 84? Olympics..  Hate to say it, but I saw the crash of the Jamaica team when it happened!<br /><br />Enjoy the movie!  Great movie for kids too...
B0025KVLVA|5|If you can only have one Beatle CD this should be it. It's an outstanding full career collection based on combining the original Past Masters CDs released in the 80's.  Enjoy

B004SJ3BCI|4|A simple and yet highly addictive game, creative and full of laughs. The sounds and scenes are amazing and each of the progressive birds are amazing. You quickly find your favorites and the ones you realy prefer, then the program changes a bit and they are not quite as strong, or usueful for that particular round. The game certainly teaches you patience, in the beginning you can not move on until you have mastered the scene. It is fun and frivilous, and certainly seems innocuous, yet be aware, it will become very addictive in a short time. Something so simple, and yet so frustrating and fun.
B00005A46T|4|This cd isn't as good as the first but still great. It is kind of the same thing as the last album: screaming, loudness, and etc. The cd still rocks though. The vocals seem to have matured a bit and gotten a bit deeper. Buy this cd!!!!!!!!!
B000BYACOY|5|This is a beutiful movie. I could watch it over and over. The video was in fine shape. Shipping time was great. It was an excellent purchase.
0385493622|5|This was an easy and satisfying read (not expected).<br />Most college freshmen will miss a few bits in the weeds,<br />partly since it's light on the actual math.<br /><br />The general public can appreciate this well-written history;<br />it often reads like a dramatic novel.<br />All math majors should read it.<br /><br />It's not so much for math learning; more for the history,<br />culture, and building of a math monument.<br /><br />(I think Fermat did have a short proof, so the issue is not dead to me.)
B00BSB2AE4|5|You can tell right away that she is true to herself, and her honesty and humor grab your attention. I like her way of viewing herself, and viewing the world.
B00ECU34ZM|1|This movie is tasteless, and boring. If you have seen the amazing film Moon you'll instantly recognize that this movie stole the biggest plot twist in the movie DIRECTLY from Moon. They didn't even hide it, at all. Then for some good measure sprinkled Independence Day in. The acting is terrible, the effects are just polishing a poorly written turd. Just do yourself a favor and watch Moon first if you somehow read this before watching this horribly unoriginal garbage.
B007J4T2G8|3|Writing was awe full at first, but eventually you get caught up in the story line and forget. Very different from anything I have read before.

0312383436|4|This is the first Madeleine Wickham book I have read and I have to say that I really enjoyed.  Milly is a very sympathic character and you really want things to work out for her.  Some people will say that no one could be as naive as Milly who truly believes if you don't talk about unpleasant things they aren't happening.  I know several people like this in real life and can imagine them acting the same way.      In some ways the story lines aren't anything new:  Milly tries to behave the way she thinks Simon wants her to, Simon hates his father because he abandoned him and his mother only to come back into life when he was an adult, Simon feels inferior to his millionare father, Milly's mother acts like Milly is still 14, Milly's father prefers his \\"career girl\\" older daughter over flakey Milly.  These are not new family dynamics. Etc...      What really made this book interesting was the story line between Allan and Rupert.  Their love story is very believable and touching.     There were several character story lines that could have been omitted to make a tighter story.  The whole Esme story line was un-needed as was the one between Isobel and Harry.    The main theme of the book is being who you are and not what you think others want you to be.  It's a good theme for all of us.
B00EHMFC78|3|Seriously?<br />I have read many of your novels and this one left me flat. Seems that you have chosen to glorify violence over substance, and you killed off the heroine to accomplish what? To infer that local cops and secret service agents (or anyone else but Robie and Reel) are clumsy and ineffective?<br />You developed her character well, and then offed her to use a preconceived &#34;tender moment ending&#34; at the gravesite?<br />Chung Cha would have played well in a future story. Poop. I'm very disappointed.
B000B5IPLK|5|Wonderful album. Great purchase, don't hesitate to buy it. I've been waiting for oct 11th just to buy it. It has all of her old hits, but never old in her sense; along with the new tracks. Definitely receives a 5 in my book.
B00012FXB8|2|I don't know if I've ever seen a sequel that makes so many bad decisions so fast and so early in.  Even before the opening titles were over, I had no idea how this film was going to win the viewer back.<br /><br />Face-huggers get loose in the ship escaping the second rousing film, ALIENS, do their dirty deeds, then die and bleed acid to breach the systems and hulls.  The survivors are jettisoned without ever waking up.  Newt, the adorable little girl from ALIENS, is killed.  Michael Behn's heroic Marine--killed in the crash.  The droid--tilt.  All that's left is Sigourney Weaver and she crash lands on a dreary, dirty prison planet populated with dirty, repellent inmates.<br /><br />All of this in the first five minutes.  Ugh.  On top of all that, they shave Sigourney's hair off and turn one of her eyes blood red.<br /><br />It's almost as if they had a pre-production meeting and asked, \\"How can we ruin the ALIEN franchise?  Let's ugly up the star, fill the movie with the scum of the galaxy....\\"<br /><br />There's a reason this is \\"the least successful in the ALIEN series.\\"

B000002IKR|5|This is Testament's debut album and one of the best thrash albums EVER.If you are starting your thrash collection,this should be one of the first albums you buy.Everything about this album is classic.It also features one of my favorite lead guitarists,Alex Skolnick,who is the best thrash guitarist,hands down.It also features one of my favorite bassists,Greg Christian.The album kicks off with \\"Over The Wall\\",which is one of my favorite thrash songs,and my favorite here.Up next is \\"The <br />Haunting\\",which is my third favorite on here.Great riff,great solo.Up next is the concert favorite \\"Burnt Offerings\\",which isn't as good as the first 2,but is still really good.Up next is \\"Raging Waters\\".This one has some pretty evil lyrics,but Chuck sings them pretty fast.Up next is C.O.T.L.O.D.DAMN this song is fast.Like \\"Raging Waters\\",this has pretty evil lyrics,but are sung fast.Up next is \\"First Strike Is Deadly\\".Great chorus and one of the best solos on this album.\\"Do Or Die\\"is the weakest song,but not bad at all.\\"Alone In The Dark\\"is my second favorite here.GREAT vocals on the bridge and a great solo.\\"Apocalyptic City\\" closes the album.Great chorus and the best solo on the album.
B00000490M|5|What are they guys at AFI thinking?  I think the inmates have taken over the asylum there.  THE KARATE KID, by John Avildson and Mark Kamen, is probably on my TOP 10 Greatest Films of All Time.  And no, Citizen Kane, is not on there.<br />    People, please listen up:  Don't let ANYONE think for you.  No one on this planet is smarter than you.  If someone tells you that &quot;Fargo&quot; is a better movie, let them.  If they tell you to shut up, then karate kick em or sue em.  I don't want to see this generation growing up thinking a lousy, miserable film like 'Fargo' is any better than 'The Karate Kid'.  The committee on the AFI are composed of mainly one tribe.  This tribe is like 'Big Brother'.  They're extremely intolerant of any viewpoints outside of their sphere of thinking and will literally die before being told they're wrong.  They're evil, pure and simple.  <br />'The Karate Kid' is a masterpiece and I give kudos to the filmmakers, I give a holler to Frank Price, who greenlit this movie at Colombia, and I give a special thanks to everyone on this message board.  REMEMBER THE COURAGE THAT DANIEL SHOWED.  Today's Kobra-Kai's come as snakes in sheep's clothing.  Be very, very careful of them. AND ALWAYS KEEP YOUR GUARD UP.  They're infiltrating every facet of our society, slowly and deliberately.  I've never felt such an unhealthy and creepy feeling than when I'm near them.  KEEP YOUR FAITH ALIVE AND DON'T GIVE INTO THEM. THANK YOU!
B0000CD5I6|4|I don't see why some reviewers feel there's a lack of energy here, but then I haven't gone back and compared these song versions with previous ones.  All I know is I haven't cared too much for some of the more recent Tull albums, but thought I'd give this one a chance. I was very pleased with the whole album. I've heard a couple of the tunes before, like &quot;Solstice Bells&quot; and &quot;Bouree&quot;.  &quot;Bouree&quot; is definitely a remake. Can't say it's better than the original but it's definitely no worse. Jethro Tull, to me, is unique in the rock genre for the skillful blending of old and new. It's rock with folk undertones, and Ian Anderson's gift for songwriting and arranging is unparalleled (catch &quot;Greensleeved&quot; and &quot;We Five Kings&quot;). I've got friends who won't give Tull a listen because they claim flute has no place in rock music.  But Tull is not the typical rock group, and they don't know what they're missing. The whole album is enjoyable listening even if you're not into Christmas music.  Even without the holiday theme, the songs are strong and melodic in their own right. Highlights are &quot;Another Christmas Song&quot; and the incredible instrumental &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;.
B006VFLIYK|4|This story will keep anyone from putting it down once they start reading. The action up to the book's climax is spell binding. I would reccomend this book.
B00OKYQZDI|5|It's an addictive game but fun. Sometimes frustrating. I like it because it makes you think about how to solve it. Very much like Bejeweled Blitz. Unfortunately, Bejeweled Blitz is NoT available for Kindle Fire yet.

B00005N6KG|5|I ordered these headphones with a bit of hesitation. I normally use the Sennheiser over ear headphones, but I couldn't justify spending another 50 bucks on them so I opted for these. I was very happily surprised!! I do a great deal of jumproping, and these work great! They are very light and they stay in my ear, which was a surprise. They are great for the price, BUY THEM!!!
0634014331|5|This is honestly the most helpful method book I've ever used.  The author had written down so many Hammond tips that would be so challenging to learn elsewhere.  I have also learned so much more about jazz progressions and cool organ licks.  I do feel that you have to have strong music reading skills to make the most out of this book.  The recordings and repetitions in different keys will make me more fluent in playing these styles.  I love this book  and CD!
B007PTJOV0|3|OK
B001HBYHFA|5|I loved the show so when they made the movie I was excited. If you like the show then you'll love the movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Another Excellent Read!  John Grisham maintained his reputation for enjoyable reading with this book.  Characters were interesting and colorful.  Great book.
0440237688|5|I enjoyed this book.  The story line was never boring and it moved at a good pace.  The unique ending leaves the reader curious about the boys fate.  This is a great read for adults, teens, and children over the age of nine.<br /><br />Jonas grows up in a society where there is no crime, pain, or inequality. This \\"ideal\\" world is created because controls have been established that promote sameness.  For example, climate controls have been devised that prevent different seasons, medication is taken to suppress sexual impulses, colors have been eradicated, jobs are assigned by community elders, and spouses and children are designated based on compatibility.<br /><br />Jonas' life changes when he turns twelve and is assigned his role as the receiver. He begins his training with the \\"Giver.\\"  The giver is the only person that holds all the memories of life's true pleasures and pain. The giver's job is to transfer these memories to Jonas, and train him to become the next giver. When these memories are passed on to Jonas, and he experiences pleasure, pain, and the freedom of choice, he becomes torn between his presently controlled existence and a possible uncontrolled existence that includes pain, war, pleasure and love. He must decide between the two worlds for himself and everyone living in the community.<br /><br />This is a wonderful read for anyone that enjoys science fiction and adventure.
B009NQKPUW|4|3D effects are good.  Story line great.  Lead into Aliens excellent.  Would definitely recommend this for sci-fi enthusiasts.  Fantastic lead into the Aliens movie line.
B00C33M2EE|2|I was disappointed - I should have listened to the tracks before ordering....  Nowhere near as enjoyable as their other stuff.  Am looking forward to their Christmas collection.
B003Q6D2B4|5|I love the all star cast. Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich make you laugh and keep you on the edge of your seat. You will laugh at there antics and follow every twist and turn. Great fun!
B00338QENI|4|This book was an intriguing into the ethics of medical science. The Lacks family with forever be remembered because of Skloot's work.
B008Y7N7JW|5|Movie starts a little slow, but it is worth the buildup.  I hope the second movie comes out very soon.
B00GMV8M2Y|5|A great ensemble cast of quirky characters in a fun/serious turn-the-tables caper movie based on the 70's Abscam scandal.  Jennifer Lawrence is amazing--it took me a while to figure out who was playing the character!  Great period rock sound track and a good share of gaudy disco-era costumes. The DVD includes an acceptable produced &#34;making-of&#34; piece--I would have liked a director's and/or actors' commentary soundtrack more.
B001NLKXK2|5|Excellent book!! Sometimes I forgot it was fiction
B008133MDK|4|I actually watched Season 1 and Season 2 back to back over 2 days' time.  This is probably not the way it was intended to be seen. That being said, I enjoyed season 2 more than Season 1.  The only episode I didn't enjoy at all was the second one, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles, ' which in my opinion, was truly terrible.  They were trying for a completely non-supernatural, modern-science update of the classic Sherlock Holmes story, and it just didn't come off.  Not even watching Sherlock have an emotional freak-out moment could save this episode....it was more disturbing than revealing, a waste of a good Benedict Cumberbatch performance (now that's criminal!) Watson was wasted there also, and that's doubly bad, because the Watson in this update of Sherlock Holmes' adventures is far more interesting, much more of a partner.  I was getting truly tired of having it repeatedly shown that Watson's lovelife is awful, thanks in part to his association with Sherlock, in that episode.  But enough of Episode 2.  In Season 2 we also find out a lot more about Mycroft Holmes, who's more complex and interesting, than I could have imagined Mycroft to be. That was a pleasant surprise.  We meet him again in Episode 1 and in 3.  The third episode was very difficult to watch, very intense, very well done....except for the end, which was completely predictable.  The first episode, 'A Scandal in Belgravia', was really good, except for the end (again!), which was IMHO, just stupid.  I liked the twist on Irene Adler's character (forgive the pun), and I love plot elements that are different/fresh/innovative, so this one was definitely fun to watch.  But I just hate it when the end isn't as interesting as the beginning, because that's what keeps you coming back.  Love Benedict Cumberbatch, love Martin Freeman, love the great partner chemistry, love the whole concept of an updated Sherlock.  I hope Season 3 is a cut above the first 2 because my patience is running out.
B002JVWQSW|5|Again excellence in the comedy field of sitcoms.  Now I have to purchase season 4.  Can't wait to see it !!!
B00377E5SG|5|Thoroughly enjoyable. Characters have enough depth to offer believability. Interaction humorous and dramatic as well. I was happy to sit back and let the story unfold. Really fine writing, casting, directing, acting. This is a favorite in the romantic comedy genre.
B0095ZMMCK|5|Prophetic depiction of our cyber challange with vivid descriptions of just how computer warfare can kill. This book is very well written and keeps your attention throughout. It is an amazing match with very current events in our relationship with China.<br /><br />Gerald Rodts
B0016B6ZKG|5|I listened to my first Donna Summer Album in 1975.  It's been quite a ride.  With \\"Crayons\\" one has to admit that Donna is back.  This album has done for Ms. Summer what \\"Believe\\" did for Cher.  It is not a re-hash of seventies disco, but a current and contemporary collection of great songs and superb delivery.  None of her original talent or energy has diminished.  In a phrase...She still got it!
B005S9ELVC|5|Good movie
B00GRVV29E|5|This app is mesmerizing, very similar to the effect generated watching colorful reef fish swimming in a  fish tank.  This way you get the calming effect without the work and expense of acquiring or maintaining the fish!  In one to five minutes swirling the particles around the screen (the time spent usually depends on the level  of aggravation I need to overcome) I'm totally calm, relaxed, ready to deal with whatever stressors had driven me to need a break.
B002N5N4M6|5|I got this as a Christmas present for a daughter, but since I never miss an episode of Big Bang, I know it is great without seeing it again.

B006MOW98E|4|John Green is a great author, and I bought this book when I saw his name on it. All three stories are good and fun - a very enjoyable holiday read!
B000002HRE|5|Excellent Metallica
B000FCKRDI|5|This was my favorite book by Lisa Klepas. Sebastian and Evie's love is hypnotic; you can't help but cheer them on with every page. I couldn't put this book down and over the years have re- read it several times. It has very comical situations that will make you laugh out loud. Definitely worth the read. I also highly recommend, Worth Any Price and Again The Magic. You will enjoy every page of all three of these books.
B007THA4FI|4|The subject matter makes it difficult to say I &#34;enjoyed&#34; the book, so giving four stars doesn't mean I will read it again.  But I am glad that I've read it once.<br /><br />This is a difficult but well-written book.  Sharply observed human nature is not prettied up at all here.  I understand why people who had read Harry Potter were disappointed, but Rowling's writing remains exceptional.  The Casual Vacancy is simply a very different type of book and reflects a reality that is NOT black and white, but gray in its complexity.
B0053F042G|4|My husband and I have seen Source Code twice.  Both times we thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting is excellent, the premise creative. However, if you contemplate it too much, you'll start to find the holes in the plot and this of course steals a bit of the magic. So watch it, enjoy it, but don't think too hard about how it all comes together because this is really just a popcorn flick, and it doesn't stand up well to logical scrutiny.
0316001821|4|try \\"Forgiving Ararat\\" by Gita Nazareth. \\"Forgiving Ararat\\" [[ASIN:0982560516 Forgiving Ararat]]is a unique and inspiring afterlife adventure! The book's heroine is Brek Cuttler, a 31-year-old lawyer, wife and mother who happens to be recently deceased.   Leaving behind her new baby daughter and her TV reporter husband, Brek suddenly finds herself sitting in a deserted train station, not yet aware of her own passing. She meets Luas, who reveals she has come to a place called Shemaya, the place between life and death, Heaven and Hell. Luas looks like a combination of people she knows; he appears to each soul as they expect or desire to see him. In fact, much of what Brek sees is only because it's what she wants to see. When she wants, she sees herself dressed in her favorite black silk suit but alternately she's naked and bloody, three bullet holes in her chest. She can't remember how she died and won't until she's ready.    We travel with Brek as she explores Shemaya, a place where all four seasons exist at once, where her long-dead great-grandmother waits with open arms, where God judges arriving souls and decides their eternal fate. Luas tells Brek she is to join his team of elite lawyers, charged with representing souls in the Final Judgment. As she clings desperately to her earthly life, in agony longing for her family, she struggles with her new job in the afterlife. To learn her new trade, she observes the trials of other souls, viewing glimpses of their lives through their own eyes. As she watches their lives unfold, connections form, leading her to solve the mystery of her own death.  Meantime, she recalls pivotal moments in her own life; she puts childhood friends \\"on trial\\" for crayfish murder, she struggles to accept her parents' divorce, and she confesses her deepest and darkest secret. And we see it is justice she's been after since childhood, that's why she became a lawyer. And it is justice she seeks in death.     Religious themes are prevalent throughout the novel, mostly Judeo-Christian with some hints of Buddhism. Raised Catholic, Brek is drawn to Judaism, the religion of her husband. With Brek we visit the Garden of Eden and sway on the deck with Noah.  And it is the afterlife after all, so she eats whatever she wants without gaining an ounce, she shops without money, she climbs mountains without breaking a sweat, and she travels to whatever destination she imagines. Well-drawn characters from her life and those she meets after death are woven in adding to the suspense.     I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The author drew me in so deeply, I felt Brek's emotions as if they were my own. The author creates an image of the afterlife that is altogether beautiful, frightening, gory, inspiring, mysterious, joyful and sad. I think anyone regardless of their beliefs, can gain something from this book. It's a murder mystery, supernatural thriller and a theological debate all rolled into one. Clever and imaginative, \\"Forgiving Ararat\\" is a fulfilling read!
B001GKJ2FW|5|It was a great musical, and frankly great for women, but as a guy, I will never get it. I guess there is freedom in musicals unlike any other media, where you can act silly and no one will diminish it, or criticize it.

B00N9HWZYK|5|Meghan Trainor is a young artist with an old school feel. Fun, catchy, doo woo songs that linger in your head for days. Only wish would be options for tracks with and without questionable lyrics (radio versions) so I could share these awesome tunes with my kids.
B000001EC1|5|I chose this review because I really liked the music and also my favourite songs were all on this album
B0020BUWX2|4|This book makes you think of what you may do if given a choice of life or death in a very tough situation.  Good story, easy to read. I read the next book in the series too and liked it also.
B004LOMB2Q|5|This software is awesome. I have it installed on my Kindle Fire, my Sanding Galaxy Exhilarate, and on my laptop and desktop computers. I can enter notes on any one of my devices and then access it anywhere. I am always making notes to myself and I use to just text myself but using Evermore is so so so much better! !
B000001FA4|5|I was a freshman in college when this album was released.  I remember begging my parents to go buy it for me before they came to visit me on campus (in very rural Tennessee - no place to buy new vinyl).  In my opinion this album was the culmination of the raw talent in U2 with the production skills of Eno and Lanois, producing U2's best, most creative work throughout their career.  Sure, they became mega-stars later on, but never again did they release anything with the creative range this album offers.  Eno and Lanois' were able to comprehend the appropriate mood and atmosphere for the topic of the songs and capture it perfectly in the studio, producing an album that stands out amongst many great ones.    My power went out for about 8 hours last Saturday night during a tremendous thunderstorm.  Left with nothing but a fully charged iPod I lay in bed and listened to this album for the first time in a long time and remembered just how great it is, from Bono's soaring vocals to the layered atmospherics of Edge's guitar, and of course the driving rhythm section of Mullens and Clayton.  I highly recommend listening to this from start to finish in a dark room with headphones - truly one of my all-time favorite albums.  It's no coincidence that Brian Eno has had a hand in many of my all-time favorites (see Talking Heads' Remain in Light).
B00004Y6NT|5|Obviously I am a Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler fan, I can not be objective on any review.  I think everything they do is fabulous.
B003Q6D2B4|5|ok
B008FPOIT6|4|This book didn't move me in any way, I don't think I learned anything profound but it was interesting and entertaining. The people in my book club ripped this book apart, they apparently like those long boring books that have so much detail it's hard to find a story line.
0375831002|5|The Book Thief is such a fabulous read...don't miss it! Markus Zusak paints vivid pictures with his words and you'll find yourself rereading parts over and over wondering: \\"Now how did he think of that?\\" I had to put this book down for a day or two because I didn't want to finish it...it was like saying goodbye to an old friend. The narrator is Death...now how intriguing is that? This is the most beautifully written book that I have ever read...trust me, you will feel the same way.
B00AYE8C70|5|This is amazing. My grand daughter just moved to Germany and staying in touch is so easy. Surprisingly good sound quality- only an occasional metallic hiccup. Love that you can flip to video to actually show what you are talking about.
B0039TAHMA|5|If you like action and adventure, and you enjoy seeing many characters that are so interesting..you'd enjoy this movie in the series as well. The computer generations, and the background scenes were incredible. The movie really brings you in.

B000KX0IOK|5|If there ever was a movie that should be seen for an astonishing performance by an actor, it's \\"Half Nelson\\" with Ryan Gosling.  The Canadian born Gosling, who co-starred in \\"The Notebook\\" with Rachel McAdams and made his debut on \\"The Mickey Mouse Club,\\" plays Dan Dunne, a history teacher in a Brooklyn junior high school.  Nominated for an Academy Award, Gosling brings incredible depth to the role of the troubled teacher with a cocaine problem.<br /><br />When Dunne is not struggling with \\"crash and burn\\" in the harsh morning light of the classroom, he's hell-bent down the road of self-destruction.  Despite the double life, he is a good teacher who really does inspire his students.  He manages to bypass the regular curriculum by sharing his belief in Hegelian dialectics, the idea that history or change can only happen through opposing forces.  Watching Dunne make such enormous effort to put on a good face for his students is heart-rending.  It is impossible to witness his plight in the morning and not remember the worst hangover you ever had.<br /><br />The story starts moving in a new direction when 13-year-old Drey (Shareeka Epps) finds her history teacher on the restroom floor after a basketball game.  From then on, they forge a bond over the disclosure of his drug use, which he still tries to hide from her.  He starts driving her home after games and exchanging knowing looks with her on particularly bad mornings.<br /><br />Lest you think this turns into the tired formula of the forbidden teacher-student affair, let me stop you right there.  Director Ryan Fleck and co-writer/co-producer/editor Anna Boden sidestep the genres of romance and inspirational classroom fable, and create an entirely different story of redemption.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Drey develops a schoolgirl crush, while her teacher grows too protective of her, especially around her drug-dealing older friend Frank (Anthony Mackie).  We see the film cut back and forth between two scenes: Drey looking shyly at herself in the mirror during a moment of sexual awakening and Dunne in the throes of a careless, drug-enhanced sexual encounter with another teacher.<br /><br />Teacher and student are from different worlds, but each stands at the crossroads in their lives.  The filmmakers honor this experience between the two without exploitation or spending too much time discussing right or wrong.  Neither character is assigned the role as the main catalyst for the change brewing in their lives, but the simple friendship between teacher and student brings healing and transformation.rey looking shyly at herself in the mirror during a moment of sexual awakening and Dunne in the throes of a careless, drug-enhanced sexual encounter with another teacher.<br /><br />Teacher and student are from different worlds, but each stands at the crossroads in their lives.

B001E45XT4|4|My last headphones, JVC HA-RX700's, were godly in terms of sound quality and how comfortable they were, but alas they were not long for this world.<br />After a brief funeral ceremony in the backyard I began my search for new headphones, and considering I've never had a decent pair of headphones last more than a couple of years(I have crappy ones from ten years ago that still somehow work fine) I decided to go more on the lower end of the headphone quality spectrum.<br />After reading a good number of reviews I was a bit wary about the quality and design of these headphones, but the price was right and just from looking at the picture they look like they're designed fairly well. To my surprise not only do these headphones not hurt my head, but I can wear them for hours at a time no problem, unlike my JVC headphones which would eventually get to hot and make my ears hurt. In regards to how comfortable these headphones are they actually beat my old headphones. Sound is another story; the bass is severely lacking and the sound just isn't as crisp with a bit of static if the volume is up. My old headphones didn't have a microphone, instead I used a Samson condenser mic, which isn't a fair comparison to a pair of $30 headphones with a mic, obviously the condenser mic is better.<br />I can say that compared to the quality of other headsets I've had that did have mics this one doesn't quite seem like the quality is as good, but it's not too bad really.<br />The headphone cups are quite bulky giving a nice amount of room, meaning pressure is distributed nicely over my ears which is good for long use, but at the same time the material is lightweight so they don't fatigue your neck after long use. Which is one of my biggest worries/complains, the plastic feels extremely cheap and I don't know that this headset will last. The headset is very bulky, but the plastic seems to be hollow with very thin walls.<br />The cord on the headset looks as though it will get nasty kinks or indentions in it if wrapped up, and the two 3.5mm connectors for the sound and mic are very thin at the end, to the point where I can see easily breaking them if I yanked them out to hard. On the cord about a foot down from the headset is a somewhat useful volume dial, a shirt clip I will never use, and a mic toggle I will never use.<br />Overall I'm very happy with these headphones for the price, but only time will tell if I'll stay that way.
B000002C4J|2|I used to like her music but a lack of variation in musical-style means: that of late - as evidenced by that quite wretched song from the  'Titanic'- she has begun to sound more and more like a coyote on a hill  howling at the full moon. She is becoming too bland and one-dimensional in  her presentation.
B001KZIRL8|4|Fun movie to just enjoy over and over again without having to THINK alot.  Sometimes you just need a fun movie on those rainy days/nights or just when you need a break.  Great casting and fun storyline.

B000068QY7|4|When I first bought this CD, I wasn't expecting much, especially after Oasis's last offering, the bland &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants.&quot; But with first listen, I LOVED all the songs on &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;! (ok, maybe not like 1 or 2) This is EASILY the best Oasis CD since their &quot;Morning Glory&quot; days. Even though it lacks the raw energy found on their excellent debut, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is a must buy for any Oasis fan, and a good buy for anyone else. The standout tracks: &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;, &quot;Hung in a Bad Place&quot; and &quot;Little by Little&quot;. The &quot;growers&quot;: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; (I thought it was alright the first time I heard it, but then I LOVED it with a second listen) &quot;Probably All in the Mind&quot; and &quot;Songbird&quot;. All in all, a very good offering. GO OASIS!

076790592X|5|Tuesdays with morrie is an awsome book because it teaches us..to be real and basically to get over it.  We can all learn from Morrie because he talks from his heart and he tells us that you must live everyday as if it was your last.  Morrie taught that you should not want to be envied or envy because there is basically no need for it..you should just help people through out your life beacause you wont learn how to live, unless you learn how to die.  If yourself or anyone you know is facing any sort of problem in life or just like reading i highly suggest you read this book...you wont regret it!
B003XT60KO|4|Although originally written many years ago, it reads like a modern day primer on the underlying basics of economics and the political antics that we experience continually (Fiscal Cliff, Sequester, etc, etc.) From now on, it will be interesting to watch the next new \\"political crises\\" unfold and have a better shot at being able to read between the lines.

B00EMXBDMA|5|This book had me from the very beginning and kept me until the end. It was so interesting to learn how the main character, Mark Watney was able to figure out what he needed to do to survive. Being marooned. ON MARS. I loved the science aspect of this book (it always rang true, not being a rocket scientist, I didn't know if it was 'real' but it seemed to be so) and that it wasn't only Mark's voice we heard but that it gave us the POV of other characters. Besides that it was always entertaining and at times very amusing!
B00KQFP5GS|3|A RoboCop remake that lacks the humor of its predecessor.
B008JFUPZI|1|\\"R.I.P.D.\\" happens to be one of those movies that could have been something great had some fatal decisions not been made. The premise is a decent one.  A recently slain cop joins up with a band of undead police officers to police the undead who didn't want to leave earth, all the while investigating his own death and parting ways with his existence.  The first big problem that came out glaring from the get-go is the sickeningly close resemblance to another movie that also used an acronym as its title; \\"Men in Black\\" aka \\"M.I.B.\\".  Once Reynolds character, Nick, passes over, you can't help but feel like you've been here before with the strange characters and the weird partner and the white walls, etc. etc. etc.  They copied \\"MIB\\"'s style, look and replaced aliens with ghosts and you'd think they could have at least not used an acronym as well.<br /><br />Then there's Jeff Bridges playing an old west sheriff named Roy.  The movie tries to be as funny and quirky as \\"Men in Black\\" but only once or twice does the comedy actually work.  I was thinking that maybe some more of the comedy would have worked had we actually been able to understand Bridge's mumbling incoherent words. He sort of did the same thing in 2010's \\"True Grit\\" and I remembered thinking the same thing then, although this time, it was even worse. If this is his normal voice, which it may be, then his career is in trouble.<br /><br />As \\"Men in...\\" err, \\"R.I.P.D.\\" plays out, the story is actually a really good one and it's a terrible shame that the creators didn't brainstorm a little longer to try and be more unique, but they didn't. In fact, the finale of the film is absolutely fantastic and the best part of the movie.  In the movies final moments the effects are outstanding and the emotions of the characters are fleshed out, giving \\"R.I.P.D.\\" at least one thing to be positive about. Unfortunately, it took a long and painful time getting there.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie was poorly handled by director Robert Schwentke. A perfect example of how poorly it was handled is the use of one of the best gimmicks in the film. Nick and Roy don't look the same when they are earthbound. Nick looks like an elderly Asian man and Roy looks like supermodel Marisa Miller. It is a funny gimmick but even this is poorly used. There are many moments where it would have been better to have had Marisa Miller delivering the lines instead of Jeff Bridges. Regardless of how poor of an actress she was or is, we could have understood the words and it would have been funnier having her deliver some of Roy's lines. There's no excuse for wasting such a great gimmick. None.<br /><br />Thanks to only being able to understand half of one characters dialogue, a funny gimmick that was horrendously handled until the final thirty seconds of the film and the obvious comparisons to \\"Men in Black\\", \\"R.I.P.D.\\" is the hands-down front runner for the 2013 razzie awards. Will and Jaden Smith and their \\"After Earth\\" are thankful, as well as Robert Deniro from \\"Big Wedding\\".ctor Robert Schwentke.

B00EMXBDMA|5|I really wish it didn't end so quickly.... You go from a huge massive climax to the end in one page. That's my only complaint.

B00DHKKN6Q|1|In the beginning, the game is fun; however, any game that requires money for extra items to complete the game is a scam, from my viewpoint. $1.99 2 or 3 times during a game can add up quickly to a great deal of money and for what? Bubbles... I think not.

1591840562|5|After I read the book I had to drop him a short note to thank him for putting so many good information in such as easy to read book. <br /> <br />I was familiar with some of the concepts from an Engineering Venture Management class I took but Guy did a fantastic work in collecting all this knowledge in this book in a clear understandable format. <br /> <br />If you are thinking of creating your company \\"to change the world\\", this is a MUST read book. If you are just interested in knowing what is behind successful entrepreneurs this will give you a good inside look at what you have to do and mainly what not to do. <br /> <br />If you are not interested in entrepreneurial at least borrow the book from someone else and read the last chapter.
0805054375|4|i think it is dissapointing to hear people complain about how this book isn't as good as the movie. in fact, perhaps it would have been better if i hadn't seen the movie first because the originial ideas of Chuck Palahniuk  are the WORDS, not brad pitt or edward norton. if anything, this book  proves it's point to you if you thought is was worse than the movie: 1. you  like things 2. you like to buy things 3. you want things 4. you need  society 5. &quot;you're the faker.&quot;  this book deserves more  recognition than any movie screen can offer, unfortunately somewhere  between birth and our &quot;20-something&quot; lifestyles, we forget to  read. i don't deny how much i'd like to take a peice of brad pitt and take  him home with me, but he is not the brain nor the words of the original  inducer. Chuck Palahniuk isn't the common house name brand. and brad pitt  is? how ironic, chuck.
B00005U2LM|5|People need to stop harping on about 36 Chambers.  That was 1993 and its over.  I dont want to hear another 36 Chambers because I already own a copy.  I want to hear new Wu and this time Rza really brought it.<br />This is an excellent album, close to classic proportions.  The production is tight on every song and the lyrics especially from the Gza, Method Man and Inspectah Deck are superb.  Even the much-maligned U-God comes correct with some funky vocal delivery on 'Soul Power' and 'The Uzi'.<br />The beats on these songs are severely head nodding and very different to what we have previously heard from the Wu.  Only 'Y'all Been Warned' and 'Iron Flag' carry that traditional Wu sound.  On the other hand Rza really brings the noise with a Public Enemy style noise attack on 'Radioactive' and the highly charged 'In the Hood' is an exciting start to the album. My only complaints really are the RnB singing on 'Chrome Wheels' and 'Back in the Game' although I think it works really well on the compassionate 'Babies'.<br />Time to stop judging the Wu on ancient history and to recognise the quality of the New Wu Order.  This album may be hard to get your head around at first but it is seductive and will suck you in.  Its a good thing they brought the glock so they can use it on those babies who keep whining about 36 Chambers.
B000FC0SIM|5|I never imagined this book would include such personal experiences by the author. If, it had resembled a textbook about writing that would have been fine, but it was filled with great practical advice about writing, personal stories, and excellent examples of the major writing topics. How can a book about writing be a page turner? It was. Thanks for the good advice and interesting stories.
B002IKLZZY|5|Always great to watch and cheer on Cary Grant as he beats the bad guys. 50th anniversary edition is filled with great extras that are not to be missed.
B0000844M8|5|A friend of mine recommended me to watch this movie.  Wonderful!!!  I just love this movie.  It was very moving.  I highly recommend it.
B000X418UO|1|This movie ranks number one on my top 9 movies list. What could be better than this movie? Nothing. It had an all star cast, and had the most original plot of any movie. No other movie has had a group of convicts hijacking an airplane before (Ignore the movie US Marshalls and a few other exceptions). But honestly, this was the greatest acting performance by Nicolas Cage ever. It is a shame he didn't win an academy award for best actor. And how about that John Malkovich. He played a psycho criminal so well, that if you saw him in real life, you would crap your pants on the spot. Dave Chapelle was wonderful too, playing an all too fitting role of a crackhead, just added to the realism. Then there was Colm Meaney. Everyone knows him from being that guy in Under Siege, and his new upcoming role playing apart from Seagal again in the yet to be released Half Passed Dead (I know good movies, and let me tell you, HPD will be number 6 on my top 9 list, and I haven't even seen it yet). Nobody can forget John Cusack being the anal retentive \\"nature boy\\" policeman. Ving Rames played a convincing criminal as well. But the greatest character in this movie was Steve Buscemi. Little do you know, but Buscemi was not acting in this movie, he actually is like that in real life.  But enough of the cast, back to the plot. What an amazing scenario, to have the criminals overtake an airplane and try to free themselves with Nick Cage (who is in the Italian-American Hall of Fame mind you) stuck in the middle of all of it. You must watch this movie to see what predicaments the criminals get themselves into, and how Nick Cage, aided by Cusack and Meaney on the ground, tries to thwart their plans. I feel this movie should have won multiple academy awards for best writing. The dialogue between characters, especially Malkovich, was nothing short of phenominal. So while I sit here and write my second comment for this movie, YOU need to go watch it. I guarantee your life will be complete upon seeing this movie.  A Masterpiece. Belongs in the Walt Disney hall of fame.
B003WUYOQ6|5|This is such a fantastic book, it explains why conventional diet wisdom is incorrect (how could it be when everyone is continuing to get more obese?) and the science behind WHY a low carb diet works.  I have drastically reduced my carb consumption and I have more energy than i've ever had in my adult life, I litterally feel like a different person.  Please read this book!
B00AO686MY|5|Fun movie
0743290119|2|Why is it called Chasing Harry Winston when only one of the characters wants to get married?  The title and the cover art make you think all three of the girls are trying to get married.  The Devil Wears Prada was funny and original, but both Everyone Worth Knowing and Chasing Harry Winston are essentially the same novel, complete with a chef/cook and a writer/editor, only not nearly as good.    I was really looking forward to this novel, but I had to force myself to finish it and I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters.  I really hope her next book is better and doesn't involve a chef or a writer.
B003Y5H4YI|5|A remake of the 2007 Israeli flick of the same name, which I'll admit to having not seen, The Debt follows two of three secret agents who went on a mission to capture the surgeon of Birkneau, and bring him to Israel to expose him for the crimes he committed against Jewish humanity during WWII. His horrifying experiments have left thousands dead in brutal and gory ways. The gang had a plan set in place, and according to a new book written about the ordeal, the mission was completed. However, something about the mission has come back to haunt them... And furthermore, that very some 30 years later, thing has the two remaining agents fearing for what happens next in life!<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, because believe me, the nervousness and suspense I felt throughout the movie is unmatched by any other film I saw this year. Believe me, this film is insanely well written. Matthew Vaughn of Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class fame wrote the script, and boy you can tell he did. His charm and genius are all over the film, in a different fashion than the two mentioned films, but his clever writing style is there. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the turn of events is clever. There's loads of suspense throughout the film. Seriously, not one scene had me feeling calm at all. The film was high octane, ferociously suspenseful thrill ride that had me on the edge of my seat from the first frame.<br /><br />The film also has a great ability to surprise people, and believe me, this movie is filled to the brim with surprise and intrigue. The film's central twist is especially shocking. Believe me, the movie definitely toys with your expectations and perception of events in pretty much every way possible. But the central twist is especially a shocker, as it completely comes out of nowhere and strikes you blindly. At the screening, you could feel everyone tense up, and especially as the film reaches its shattering climax, the suspense just got more unbearable. However, there is some good Vaughn style humor thrown in there for good measure too.<br /><br />The films' performances are fantastic. Helen Mirren shines as per usual as Rachel, and her young counterpart is not only very pretty but amazingly talented too. Jesper Christensen is amazingly scary as the villain, Vogel, and he does so without any gimmicks. But the real surprise is Sam Worthington as David. Believe me, he really, truly shines here. His portrayal is very convincing, and he manages to prove to the audience that he is not just a pretty face. As well as the film's direction is slick and sharp. madden has a fantastic eye for a shot, and it shows, there are a lot of moments of visual brilliance too, and some shots even look spooky at times.<br /><br />OVERALL: 10/10<br /><br />Pros: The Debt is an action packed, unbearably suspenseful film that is remarkably well written, stylishly shot and ferociously thrilling, a film not to be missed.<br /><br />Cons: None I can think of...e is some good Vaughn style humor thrown in there for good measure too.<br /><br />The films' performances are fantastic.
