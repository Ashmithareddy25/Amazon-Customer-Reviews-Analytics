B005Q1W10A|3.0|The serie is great, I love it but the DVD did not come with Spanish subtitules as I expected it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This app is extremely addicting and really fun. It entertains me and I can play it on long car rides. All 5 stars
B005723JSQ|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I began reading this book but I can say I ended up in fits of laughter. 'I've Got Your Number' was simply enthralling, outrageously funny and totally romantic. This was my first Sophie Kinsella book but it most certainly will not be my last, as I am going to gobble up her other books.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good belly roll kind of laugh. You will be so happy you did.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|So it was my turn to pick a book for the \\"Sensitive Men's Poetry Book Alliance\\" (a name chosen to impress our wives).  After many years, my score was the lowest in the group given my tendency to select big, thick, academic tomes.  This book is guaranteed to raise my score.  I would rank it as one of the best stories that I have ever read and I owe the authors a debt of gratitude.  I read it on the Kindle, my wife just bought a paper version, and I'm getting ready to order another paper version to give to a German friend.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Well of course this is 5 star...it's Indiana Jones...and it's in Blu-Ray. All the action one could need in a complete set!
B00139XSBA|5.0|Extremely entertaining.  Great historical information and insight.  Inspiring.  Makes me hope I have a  smidge of the stuff.  Go America!
B00932A4XE|3.0|This was a cute movie, not a favorite but definitely enjoyable. It's more of a chick flick, my husband would t have really liked it but it was good for a rainy Fternoon.
B002CMXAYW|5.0|There was nothing I did't like about this movie. If you agree, then pick up &#34;The Rutles&#34;. You won't be sorry.
B003CN4R74|5.0|i have bought this latest album of theirs and i have to say that i really loved it. i think that amy lee's vocals on it are amazing. now i cannot wait for the next album.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|I've been a Le Carre fan forever, but I have been a little disappointed in his recent work.  This seems to be up to his old standards.
0823095223|5.0|Amazing how this book gets into detail, which prooves onces again that sculpture doesn't have any secrets, that it's a whole lotta work! It has a very realistic view on the process which makes possible  a great deal of estimating the costs in time and  money.<br />One might question himself, after reading the book: &#34;do I really want this?&#34; Up to you to answer, but whatever the purpose of the reader may be...this book gives you great insight! I sculpt in my free time with waterbased clay and  molding with plaster, which is a lot easier and way cheaper than the things shown in this book but it does inspire me and frankly  just by looking through the pages I started to feel the will to try these things out...to experiment.<br />Great book, definetly!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Great and interesting movie to watch with the kids. We had a blast and l got chance to talk with them about old games
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|At first I thought this was going to be a corny version of DOLLHOUSE, but ORPHAN BLACK has its own perspective which is worth checking out.  The lead actress's performance as five different characters is a treat by itself.  Her suburban housewife is terrifying--a bit like Piper from CHARMED if Piper had a bad sex life that left her dangerously on edge.  The series is just beginning to raise sophisticated questions about the ethics of cloning and the possibility of new forms of &#34;intellectual property&#34;-based slavery in the GenEng age.  The supporting cast features the foster brother Felix, an indomitably saucy wit who sometimes steals the stage.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have to start by saying that this book was not nearly as intense as the first two but maybe Sylvia was trying to give the characters a more stable relationship to deal with all the BS. I still liked this book though because I love the characters. I had read that there would be at least one more book after this one before Entwined was released.  Do your homework and stop ripping the author apart. Can't wait for more Gideon and Eva!
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|I have been listening to Clutch for a long time now and this is one of the better of the new albums they have put out.  Most songs are really great, one or two kind of fall flat for me.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this show, and once I started watching it, I was hooked.  This a well-scripted and acted comedy/drama.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Everyone needs a dictionary. this one has great definitions and is easy to use. If you don't have one this is a good one.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|As I stated with Suits,season 1, once I started watching, I couldn't get enough of the show.  I can't wait for the June 9 premiere of Seson 4.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this sight. It takes you to many varied topics. There is something for everyone. It is very creative with lots of great ideas for many home projects.
B008ROG1QI|5.0|We love this film. Ok we love the B17's as well. Well acted. Fairly accurate. Well done. Having been inside a WWII B17 I have now got an appreciation of just how small and cramped they are on the inside, and dangerous.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I forget I'm playing a game with how beautifully everything is rendered. A must have for those who love puzzles.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I've enjoyed the previous Quell games, but this one is blowing me away.  There's so much creativity, with all the new twists and challenges, that I'm finding myself somewhat addicted and unable to stop playing.  I play this on a Kindle Fire with no errors or issues.  It does give you the option to buy more coins with real money, but no pop-up suggestions or feeling like you have to buy anything in order to win or do well.
B00A757EFW|5.0|pack man is a great game and you cant play it everywhere but now you can in this incredible app!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I bought this game about a year ago and I still play it everyday The online gaming component and the ability to play a variety of maps keeps it fresh and entertaining. If you enjoy turn-based war games, this is the best out there. My wife hates it, so if you are in a relationship that is already rocky, you should probably stay away... or better yet - break it off and enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book and the rest of them, i wish they would continue, but every good thing has to end.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|There was no conclusive ending - and most of this book was uninteresting filler. Sadly, I'm not sure how to describe the level of disappointment I'm feeling. I loved the first two novels, and am feeling a little cheated by the lack of actual \\"content\\" in the third book. =/
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|All you have to do is read the title.  This app is addictive and is probably one of the best apps I've purchased (Oh, wait,  it's FREE!!!!!!!!!)  so far and its based off SIMPLE PHYSICS........ and you wouldn't even notice.  All in all,  this is a GREAT APP that will entertain you for hours on end.
0670014893|5.0|I keep thinking Le Carre will decline as a writer. However, although his subject and focus has changed, he's lost none of his ability to write a fascinating novel of intrigue and government malfeasance. Read the review in the New York Review of Books from the first week of June 2013 to really understand Le Carre's latest novel.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I guess my title says it all, its good and bad, I felt it ended prematurely yet I want to see what happens next.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|These are all entertaining, typical Harry Bosch stories. Since they are short stories, Connelly can't give a convoluted plotl as he does in his standard novels
0307951529|5.0|You want to become an entrepreneur, you need to read this book.<br />Practical and objective<br />I recommend this book. Thank you!!!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|These are entertaining short Bosch stories that make for a quick read. Good for a couple of hours at the beach.
B0096HL33G|1.0|First of all, it is very difficult to write a review of a movie that had so little to offer.  The movie was boring, dull and Rachel Weiz should be ashamed to play in such a poor movie.  Even if her husband directed!  The acting was poor!  The actors were poor!  The plot was poor!  Rachel Weisz is far too hot for such a dull worthless movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever. I like it the best in Rome. I am glad my mom let me get this awesome game!!
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This is a great album from start to finish.  He has a great voice the songs are great, I happen to come by Ray LaMontagne by accident glad I did.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Tarantino is a serious filmmaker who has never been one to be too serious about filmmaking.  He's not afraid to make a satire of the classic cliche film styles.  The balance of storytelling, satire, performances, comedy, drama, action, joy, and outright ridiculousness strike a remarkable harmony this time around.
B000IDJNJ8|5.0|love this movie!! Best seduction ever...Sharon Stone's best performance. Love love love and cannot do without this one...definitely one you can watch over and over.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|The Puss in Boots edition's voice was a bit funnier though. Simple with increasingly fast game play. May slowdown on slower machines.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was the anticipated book of the Psy/Changling series that brings the world to the pinnacle of disaster yet there is salvation.  Secrets are revealed. New characters are introduced.  Some old friends visit.  The book is filled with intrigue, drama, joy and sorrow.  Well worth the read!  Congratulations to Nalini Singh for another well written book!
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Good concept, but flawed execution  If you've seen the trailer, the movie is the same, but the trailer is NOT the whole movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it. Couldn't stop turning the pages at all!!!! Can't wait for the other book. I need more Gideon and Eva!!!
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|I really like the sound of the album. Their previews on the site intrigued me, so I bought the album. I took a star off for the \\"loudness\\". The album is clipped all over the place. Shoddy mastering. But that seems to be the standard nowadays.
0802473156|5.0|I was given this book to read, by my pastor many years ago during my first marriage. Unfortunatly I put the book away in a shelf and never read it. Many years, and a divorce later I decided to pick up the book and read it. WOOOW.. Why didnt I read it sooner??<br /><br />This is very easy to read and it totally helps anyone & everyone understand how to show their mate love. Sometimes woman bump heads as to why didnt my husband give me a nice gift or why doesn't he help around the house? But the truth is that its all about understanding what your language of love is. Once you do, you will see many of your issues regarding affection and expression go away. It may not be marriage therapy-but it helps inmensly. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone- married or in a relationship. A must read.<br /><br />I can personally say- it's been a blessing for my current 8 year relationship. It's awesome!!!
1451624468|5.0|An easy read. It gives a humorous & clear understanding on not only how something can arise from nothing , something will always arise from nothing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't believe it has taken me so long to watch Season 1 and 2.  This now makes me even more anxious to see the next season.
B001DF68MA|3.0|We loved the idea of this since it was easy to install & I could be watching the baby as we ride. He just loved it! But it was unfortunately quite uncomfortable for me since I am only 5'0&#34; I ended up hunching over him (& he's only 16 months) so that I wouldn't bump his head with my chest and arms which was quite an uncomfortable ride when you combine it with having to pedal with my knees sticking out to not kick the seat.<br /><br />I really liked this idea but it just didn't work for me.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This has to be the worst ending I've ever seen for a book or series.  I am so disappointed in the ending of the series book
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was gripping from title to credits.  We started it at 10:00 pm and could not go to bed until the movie gad finished. It was intense and heartbreaking.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Awesome, unique story with amazing acting!  It's sad, yet funny, and touching. Bradley Cooper should have won his nomination for this role.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't know what else to say... if you like puzzle games you will love this. Well worth the money!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very addictive, great game. I have sixteen more words to use up now, so I am saying this. last two.
B000FA675C|5.0|With all of the suspense and gorgeous landscape this book draws you in so you are not able to put it down until you've finished it.
B00637HXNG|5.0|I never ever saw a 3D Blue Ray of a metal band... and yes, it's 3D all arround. It feels like I was in the crowd on a Scorpions gig!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie was is great condition considering it was used. I purchased this DVD for my daughter for her birthday and now it's her favorite movie
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A very good, although at times, extremely difficult book to read. Very much worth the time spent reading it.  Bravo, Mr Johnson!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved the series from the first episode. The story, the characters, the costumes, and of course, the house, were all wonderful.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is a fabulous book what a sequel to the selection. Read for the love match of the century. Girl
B004UXUX7S|5.0|This is such a great movie and with a great cast. It is definitely a movie that can be seen again because you will have many different emotions with each viewing. Love it.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|What can I say? I cannot wait for season 4 to be released. I do hope Maggie Smith is again on.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What a cool game, I never knew that it was an arcade game at one time, but I saw it on TV the other day.  helps with my motor skill.  very addicting
1401225756|4.0|I am a Gayman fan, not so much of a comics fan, so it´s not my favorite Gayman work, but I did enjoy it.
0525953728|5.0|The author gives a first hand account of what happened in the compound and it's alot more realistic and believable than all the documentaries and movies that have been made. Must read book!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Ok this was good but....I would have liked a little more fill in on some of the stories..they would just start to get me hooked and bam on to the next. There had to be a series in the making, questions to be answered please please please.
B001G50QCK|5.0|This season showed so much about Clark trying to gap peace and save Zod like his father asked. Really starting to become who he destined to be. SUPERMAN!
B004GYY714|5.0|Went to my local krogers guy was trying to sell newspaper subscriptions and i said what are you listening to he said tune in radio i said never heard of it so he sent me an email and i have been hooked every since you can listen all over the world any city state or country wonderful
B00AM7E4P8|5.0|A must read for foodies and nutritionists, historians and socially concious.  Oh heck!  Read it!  It is bound to engage you in a way that many other non-fiction books cannot.
B000H6SXMY|2.0|This product was WAY overcharged and falsely advertised. The title clearly says, &#34;Friends: The COMPLETE Series&#34;. When I received this product, only SIX out of TEN seasons were in the package. Better off buying each season individually!
B00846REIS|5.0|Looove this series...really wish at least the first one was lendable...I could get so many  hooked...but with a price of 9.99 for each book...not many go for it..
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I like the game but don't like having to wait to move on because of the tournaments. It is fun.
B009RH9HDS|3.0|it's very heavy and the the case won't stay propped very well because the place you insert the tab is too shallow.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Well written summation of years of work and writing - The author is very sincere and has had obvious success with the method he teaches and it's certainly well worth the cost of the book and the time to read it.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|gary clark jr, is a gensis with his guitar, and his voice in baby come home, took my mind  back to a place when a man spoke to truth to the woman he loved! excellent!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the Bible, you have to give it 5 stars!!!  But it is very well done, easy use of different translations.  Good app.
B005DESVPO|3.0|this was okay for me, prehaps a second best as compared to blak and blu, the sound was a bit more deep blue grass blues in its earliest form.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Liked the captain and his values, the crew and their dedication to each other, the humor and the action, the space-western vibe.
0452289963|5.0|I recommend this book if you want to recognize the ego. How to live in the present and be happy always no matter where you live, where you work or who you're with.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I had this app ages ago, and forgot about it. It is so fun to try to stump this guy. He is well versed in all types of pop culture. I did just manage to stump him with The Karate Kid's mom though. Highly recommend, whether paying or grabbing FAOTD.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS AN INSTANT CLASSIC. I WATCHED IT A FEW TIMES AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT AGAIN.... BOOOOOOM!
B0088T3B0G|5.0|Kevin Spacey puts himself on the map with this one.  Bulk of the film is solid, but the twist ending makes this movie an all-time favorite.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|All I can say is wow. No matter who I pick it gets it correct.  I had my kids pick Snot Rod from Cars &amp; it got it correct.  A+ app running on Motorola razr
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very richly written, I was taken on a journey to new and interesting places and into the minds & hearts of a family I wish I could have met & really known. Thank you for the experience it afforded me and I anxiously await your next novel..  Do hurry up, I can hardly wait!!!1 Many Thanks....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was an amazing, heartfelt book. Once again, Ms. Hoover didn't disappoint. She is def one of my favorite authors! :)
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Pornographic version of Twilight, it even has the same crappy plot. Couldn't get past page 73 or so. Terribl e.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|the color is just perfect.. the quality is awesome... I like the way it fits with my Iphone 5... locks perfectly... it is a great product at a great price!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|it is so much fun and the monster are so cute and you take care of them and feed them and fight with them it is so awesome YAY!
B00847KFDS|2.0|I liked the packaging with the description of each song but the songs..... Nah... Not so much.  .  Would have much better left singing them alone.  Adding a female to sing a CCR song?  Nah...  The other duets also did not cut it either.  I probably will give the CD away or just put it up and get out my old Creedence CD's if I want to listen to John Fogerty.  I was really looking forward to my favorite song , &#34;Wrote a Song For Everyone&#34;  It was the worse one on the CD!!!  I could not even listen to that song!<br />What a disappointment, and I even ordered early with anticipation.......
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have never been disappointed with Rod Stewart's music - he is as he says &#34;ageless and timeless.&#34;  Bravo - keep them coming.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Love Rod Stewart and his new CD.  I never get tired of listening to him.  This new CD is much better than the last ones he made.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|i'm quite delighted by this surprisingly great album. after four or five listens, i've decided to give it a 5 rating because 4 1/2 isn't possible and it's better than a 4. fantastic new metal in what has been, so far, a great year for our genre. be jamming this nonstop until 13 next week ... \m/ !!!
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|All the songs on the CD are great and good to listen to.  Usually when buying a CD, there are just one or two songs that are good, but this one has all great songs.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Worth the five bucks. Drew will have you laughing out loud. You can't help but love him.  A must read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|An absolutely outstanding book.  I have read every Harry Bosch novel.  This one did not miss a single beat!  Terrific!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My sister got the update for her ipod but no update for<br />kindle fire?Any way one of the best games on kindle.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was awesome couldn't put it down!! Anyone who has read books by Sylvia Day knows its going to be good. There were highs and lows and I enjoyed this book. Look forward to more in the future!
B008OM0EDO|4.0|As of this review, there were 40 five star reviews, 39 one star reviews, and 30 or less two, three, or four star reviews.  People who are overly sensitive and easily offended might not like it.  The movie makes fun of muslim terrorists, as well as ultra-liberal do-gooders.  Personally, I don't get offended, and I thought it was pretty funny.  At the end, when our beloved dictator is telling the pro-democracy crowd the great things about dictatorships, he's actually pointing out the falacy of democracy.  He says, under a dictatorship you can wiretap phones, you can have rigged elections, you can lie about why you go to war, you can use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their own interests.  It's not a stupid movie, although there is plenty of crude humor.
0425263924|5.0|I loved the story line about Gideon and Eva together their face demons from past in this book. Eva started learn to trust Gideon and their relationship getting stronger everyday.<br /><br />I can't wait for book 4. This is my favorite book in Crossfire Series.<br /><br />***SPOILERS******<br /><br />I still loved this book and the really cool part is in chapter 18 when there are 5 black Bentley SUV in the road to make a fool for another party.
0345522478|4.0|A cross between Harry Dresden and Kate Daniels. I like it. Nice little twists and good story line. Different. Will buy next one gladly. Get it, worth the cash.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I discovered this show because of Amazon Prime.  I am not a big TV watcher most of the time, but then I saw this reviewed and decided to check it out.  I watched all three seasons in four days, and am now anxious for the fourth season to be available.  Honestly though, now I am cheating watching the real time episodes on TV because I knew I couldn't wait.  I have loved Chris Noth since his &#34;Mr. Big&#34; days, and he does not disappoint here either!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|i cant download it it says there is an issue down loading. im on a kindle fire i relly want to play it so pleas help
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|While I definitely had my issues with this book, The Crossfire series is still my favorite book series and the last 20% merited an extra star, giving it a 4 star rating for me.<br /><br />Gideon's secret molester, which had been closely guarded in the first two books, was finally revealed in this book, and it came out so lackluster that I went back to make sure that I hadn't missed anything.  We spent 2 books trying to figure out who it was and why it would be covered up so greatly, and them, bam... and nothing.<br /><br />Too much time spent on the secondary charcters.. not enough on Gideon and Eva.  Although, I am happy with the steps they take in their relationship.  The last 20% had me smiling and eager to keep going... then... it stops.<br /><br />I know people are angry and frustrated, but I knew coming into this that there would be more books... that doesn't bother me and I actually welcome it.  What I didn't like were things that fit the characters that i had grown to love in the first two books.  Gideon seemed to lose some of his alpha possessiveness and Eva just got on my damn nerves.  I really hope they get back what they lost for book 4.<br /><br />Overall, I am always captivated by Ms. Day's writing and while I cannot understand the $10 price tag for an ebook, I will suck it up and pay it because I am invested in this series.  Looking forward to book 4... hope it's not far off.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is a very easy app to use to communicate with others. I really enjoy it. This would be a great app to try
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I enjoyed this app I use facebook quite a bit, this app makes it easy to connect to facebook and my friends
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|What's not to love about this box set???<br /><br />The sculpt is awesome, the presentation is great, in a nutshell this thing rocks!<br />One of my favourite special editions and one hell of a good way to freak out some unsuspecting guests muhahahahha
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once every decade or so, television drama rises above its usual level of mediocrity and bursts into excellence. \\"Downton Abbey\\" had succeeded in that arena for three consecutive seasons and promises to reward those who wait with another 10-12 weeks of pure enjoyment. Rich in storyline, and endowed with an abundantly talented cast who portray the characters with fierce authenticity, \\"Downton Abbey\\" is a delightful retreat from the vagaries of our own lives  experiences.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Quite pleased with this version of solitaire especially for free and recommend it to anyone who enjoys the game. The only complaint are the adds, but really can't ask for better, especially for free
B00BSWMITK|5.0|First off, let me just say that this album is amazing.  I legitimately like EVERY song on the album.  My favorites are probably Three Sheets to the Wind, Jumpin' In, and Lies and Truths.  But in all honesty, they are all great.  Having Vinnie Colaiuta sit in on drums was a really good decision.  The drums sound soo much better than his previous albums.  If you are a fan of Satch, go ahead and buy this album, you won't regret it.  And if you're new to Satch, this is not a bad place to start.  I think I like Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards better overall, but this album is still truly amazing.  Overall, it's an epic album.  Definitely check it out.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|a fun and creative game full of adventure I absolutely loved it and so will you. if you get this game
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I don't like that there are just a few levels a week.  Not enough to make me want to play all the time.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is a lot of fun but there are times when the controls just feel wonky. I would appreciate the ability to heal and the missiles are just freaking annoying. Despite its minor flaws I would reccomend this game to anyone especially fans of Iron man.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this game on my pad for my grandkids and they really love it. Only problem is they fight over who plays next, LOL
B0037DGH4A|5.0|Love Santana and this remix has it all! If you have to pick just one, grab this one. You won't be disappointed.
0684847817|5.0|I loved how one half of the book was about the &#34;good&#34; fairies and then you flip the book and you get the second half of &#34;bad&#34; fairies. The art was fantastic. I thought the bad fairies were awfully cute though, with the distorted figures and goofy faces. Some were scary looking also. Great if you love fairies of any kind. Beautiful artwork.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|So many good things about this show - Tatiana Maslany, the supporting cast, the writing, even the cinematography!  This might well be one of the best shows I have ever had the privilege of discovering in40+ years of television viewing.  I cannot wait for season 2!  I predict we will see much more of Ms. Maslany... she is truly remarkable in this role.  I can't help but believe the broader population of casting agents has noticed.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|It's fun but not as fun as the other games like this and I think it could be a bit more challenging.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|With good award winning team: actors, directors, etc and a great production.<br />Even though, for dramatic purposes the story is not 100% exact as the historic events.<br />It’s a very well represented portrait of Europe very violent situation when the strong Monarchies where establishing its domain. It was a difficult time for the Church that was out of control and the strategic and violent ways Rodrigo Borgia and his family used to gain Power up to the chair of Saint Peter, to keep and broader his Power.<br />this is as good as the first Season. There are many hours of great high quality entertainment in this series.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is really fun and addictive the only thing is that it just takes a little while to get the things you want but besides that it's an awesome game!!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Really like this but I am a fan for this kind of read.  Lives lived, lives that inner twine, a little new with the old, well written for me.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|There once was a family that was killed by a which ...<br />So a new family came there were 12345 children there mommy and daddy can save the family...<br />But after they killed her the mom had bin killed daddy Dragon had to watch all the children....
B009MCRHH6|3.0|Just aggravating, I hate dying, and my two year old threw my kindle bc it made him frustrated too. Still interesting maze.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Pretty awesome game must have for kindle hd it's a pretty good challenge and a awesome racing game it never gets boring
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Really enjoyed this story well written and easy to read. I would recommend it. Liked the descriptions that put you there.
0788859544|5.0|So excited to add this to our disney collection! My daughter loves Ariel, and it was one of my favorites growing up! Thank you so much!
B002WBZD02|5.0|Gangster. John Travolta is a badass again, cool story and definitely a must see. If you like slick movies, this is one of em
B005GSVFB4|5.0|Thank you soo very much! My daughter was happy to recieve this on her bday! Pleasure doing buisness!! I am a huge fan of disney pixar films!!
B000003FMY|5.0|Reoccurring themes, very loud and brassy at times, well done. With the addition of Night on Bald Mountain, this is really a solid disc. If you have never heard the outro to Pictures at an Exhibition, it's called The Great Gates of Kiev, and it just might change your life forever. This is also a great rendition of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really really great game for little girls that love horses! Great graphics and sound effects. Very realistic too and makes you work for money and gems.
B000Q76K24|4.0|Really cool plot, good acting, overall good movie. It takes a while to develop but it's worth it if you have the time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is great and prefect for minecraft fans who travel alot the only bad part is that there are no caves besides that its great
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I had been wanting to see this musical and was eager to get the DVD after seeing previews of Anne Hathaway singing. Unfortunately, she was the only really good thing about it.  Certainly much of the music is wonderful, but the singing was very disappointing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game was made greatly and you should continue to add vehicles and levels for more greatness. You should make some other cool games.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Amazon... hello?  YOU MADE THE KINDLE FIRE.  Now you are putting up FAOTD apps which are not compatible with your own tablet?  I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS HERE!  Especially since it has already been made clear that the app IS compatible with the 1st Gen Fire, so what is the dealio guys?  I love the app on my phone, but it's just too dang small.  Get your stuff figured out people!  I didn't buy this Fire to not use it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the continuing story of Gideon and Eva.  I too was surprised that there was so much left unanswered at the end of this book.....but I am thrilled that there will be two more books.  I enjoy all the characters and the mystery and the excitement of Gideon and Eva's relationship.  I hope we don't have to wait too long for the next two books but I will definitely be reading them as soon as they are released!
159562015X|5.0|This book and evaluation tool was spot on!  I have spent 40+ years trying to be what I am not.  Life is too short to keep struggling - find your strengths and focus on what you are good at instead of fighting to become what you aren't
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The author humanly handles a difficult subject and interjects just enough empathy in his characters to off set the realities of life in a dictatorship.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Read with my book group.  The main character was hard to like at first, but you embrace her by the end.  An easy read and enjoyable.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Well acted but the director goes a bit over on the characters not turning on lights...really? Very good movie however
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Very frustrating and sad. It is a comfort to know know that in today's time  there are laws to prevent what Tess went through
B004JY0KP8|4.0|1. Because all of the hands are whitish, it can be confusing telling which hand is which; they sort of blend into the background.<br />2. Luminescent time hands do not retain sunlight well into the night -- they go dark,<br /><br />Otherwise a very nice and comfortable watch.
B00005NMVP|5.0|I still remember the first time I heard the song &#34;Year Of The Cat&#34;. It was late one night while listening to a transistor radio in my dorm room. I wrote down the artist's name and bought the album the following week. 2 albums, 2 cassettes and 1 CD later I am still blown away when I hear the intro to &#34;Cat&#34;.  &#34;On The Border&#34; is a close second for favorite song.  Al Stewart is such an incredible musician. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD. You'll be instantly transported back in time yearning for the scent of pachouli.
B006MGB31Q|5.0|really does change them in profound ways.  It's funny, but all that detail shows how much artifice goes into film making.  You can tell where lighting instruments are when Ripley is on deck; and the steam coming out of the eggs looks like steam makers.  It's an odd combination of sensations.  It simultaneously hinders willfull suspension of disbelief and makes you feel as though you are really on that set. High-Def has changed film making in all sorts of ways, but how you light a set has got to be one of the biggest.  Really breathtaking stuff!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I love this thing; It took only about 15 - 30 minutes to assemble. My 5 month old is too short for it but better too short than too tall! It has 3 different height adjustments and at the lowest he is too short but I put my snoogle pregnancy pillow underneath his feet and there he was jumping away! He seemed to be overwhelmed by all the toys at first but he's been in this for close to an hour and still isn't tired of it. I'm able to clean the kitchen, finish cooking, and write this review. I'd say this is a must buy for first time moms who just need a few extra minutes of free time! Sorry to sound like an infomercial or something but Im really happy with it so far. Now this is my first day with it so I will update if anything changes.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|I know it was made on a shoe-string budget by a bunch of college kids,but it's a truly terrifying movie!  The woods coming alive is an absolutely brilliant effect.  The voices of the demons...  *shudder*
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books before seeing the movie so I knew what to expect. I can see how people say that it dragged in the beginning or didn't explain situations. Some things were just touched upon and not much background was given.<br />I enjoyed seeing what I'd imagined while reading on the big screen. I thought that the movie was well done and held to the book very well. I can't wait for Catching Fire!
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Not a complex concept, but a well-executed puzzle app.<br />Runs smoothly on my devices. I'll keep it around for those spare minutes.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I for one am THRILLED that there are 2 more books coming out...people are really annoyed that they get to more books of Gideon?? Guess I'm in the minority who excited for more of him & Eva.  And it was known that there were more than 3 books if you follow her on Twitter & Facebook...Guess people (meaning Sylvia) can tell who really support them from the ones who don't...
B005H9B44A|3.0|Some good action scenes, predictable, cheesy plot, and questionable acting in places. Pretty much what I expected from a movie like this.
B000EXZI14|3.0|It's good but a little repetitive.  Good music to clean the house with.  Get's you in the mood.  Great harmony.
B003QSOFFO|5.0|My granddaughter comes over to the house and always asks for &#34;Oakahauntus.&#34;  At 3 this is one of her favorites and being G rated I don't need to have to hover around in case something bad shows.  Love the Disney movies!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|dont be fooled this isnt a kids movie, it may be kid freindly but that is not the same thing
B00632HWOG|2.0|I thought this would be a handy app but when I delete email, it reloads the emails back to the inbox. I have read these emails 5 times or more, deleted to the trash folder, gone back to inbox and there are the same emails again! Very frustrating! I even tried going through the web browser to the yahoo website and going through there to my inbox and deleting the email but when I go back to the inbox on the app the same emails are back in the inbox! What is going on?
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This download was an interesting ride. Lots of fun things that keep you glued to the screen, twists, turns....ACTION. There was a nice car sequence in the film, turn up the sound for it.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|Classic sci-fi, the one that started it all!!! If you like space tales , you will like this one.  Surprising film graphics for it's day.  Highly recommend watching and adding to your video library.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This years Oscar winner, what else is there to say? Good concept. excellent acting. Flawless research except for the<br />contrived ending.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Great Blu-Ray quality and a few additional scenes I hadn't noticed when I first watched these. No complaints whatsoever and solid value.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|to start with i didnt really get into sgu but by the middle of the second season i had started to like it as much as sg1 and sga,it seems to me that every programme i get into they cancel like the river and terra nova,all i have to say is that if they are going to cancel a programme the least they can do is give it a proper ending instead of leaving us up in the air,that really makes me angry when they make the last episode open ready for the next season and then dont continue,also how the heck or what the heck are ppl doing watching these crappy reality shows cause they are complete junk and just because something doesnt have good ratings in america doesnt mean its not going to work else where,so again i say at least give cancelled programmes a proper ending.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Fine cast and plot. Story line fast moving.The photography of India was outstanding. So nice to watch a movie which isn't all sci-fi or extreme violence.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I LOVED this book so much!  It answers so many questions and still leaves me wanting more!  Kaleb's  and Sahara's story is so very emotional and heartwrenching!  I totally recommend this book and series!  My one caution is that this series needs to be read in order!
B00BMT9SQA|4.0|Fast moving comedy. Well thought out plot. Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. Streisand excellent after a very long absence from the screen.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|A well deserved Academy Award for this documentary. I wish I had been listening to Sixto Rodriguez' music in the 1970's when he produced the albums. Wow!
B0095P29EG|5.0|Loved the movie great story good for kids no bad words good set  up of the Avengers, love Stan Lee where he shows up
B0033AI4PM|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came to the theater and enjoyed it tremendously. Later, I bought it on VHS; then on DVD, and, at last, on Blu-ray. It's amazingly beautiful. The colors, the sound. Barbra's singing moves your heart with excitement (&#34;I'm the Greatest Star&#34;), to delight (&#34;I Am the Beautiful Reflection&#34;), to yearning (&#34;People&#34;), to hope (&#34;Don't Rain on My Parade&#34;), to heartbreak (&#34;Funny Girl&#34;), to triumph (&#34;My Man&#34;). This Blu-ray is perfection.
B003HE2B6C|3.0|I hadn't heard --- or even thought about --- Hanson in well over a decade until I bought this CD last year. So why did I get it? I loved the Tinted Windows album that the one Hanson brother sings on, plus the many rave reviews for this album also made me pay attention to these guys again. Well, I tried to love this one, but it just didn't click for me. Two or three tracks that I really, truly thought were great and the rest of the tunes were just of the \\"alright\\" variety. In other words, nothing particularly amazing. These guys still sound good vocally and can dish out some killer harmonies. But I think some stronger material would have helped make this CD much more memorable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My brothers updated Minecraft on my mom's IPad, but I can't. I can't even connect to their game. UPDATATE IT!!!
B003ZDO90G|3.0|My first introduction of Alice Munro has not been one of great love, but her work has an old world feel that i like.<br /><br />Every now and then there is a sentence or paragraph that shows the true depth of her talents.<br /><br />Enjoyable and good reading - not sure if I am a fan yet but she is definatley a talented writer.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|WHAT!!!!! I am as mad and aggravated as most every other reader about how this story has ended but not ended. Gideon is so much in love with Eva and she is not even in the same league in love with him. She goes on about her love for him but can get exited hearing Brett's voice? Come on, it's getting stupid. I am especially mad about how the book will now have two more added to it. I was so excited and counted down the days looking forward to finishing up Eva and Gideon. These books cost way to much to keep stretching them out. You ought to be ashamed Sylvia Day!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|awesome game 'very addictive fun to play every one should play this game my kids love it hours of entertainment. hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this LITTLE GEM from my local \\"China-Mart\\" (you know the place). It is by far one of my favorite tools for touching up my tools when I'm out and about. I bought it for the diamond cone shaped rod, but have found that the other features work as well as any other \\"drag through\\" sharpeners that I use when gutting or skinning animals in the field. Plus it fits in smaller spaces than my SMITH \\"drag\\" sharpener (not that there is anything wrong with that product [just saying]). I keep a lot of things in my pockets, so conserving space is essential. I recommend this product to anyone who has a serrated blade, as it works wonders on them.
B008220C56|1.0|Glad I did not go to the theater to see this.  the movie is terrible.  I think Keira Knightley and Jude Law must have been bored and needed some work but this is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever ret was so bad that I quit<br />reading while only half way through the book.  I don't care how often boys jerk off or what they think about while doing this.<br />  I am an avid reader, and I must say that no matter how bad a book reads, I don't stop reading the book.  This book is a first for me - that I couldn't read any more than half.  It had no redeeming qualities.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game till the recent update now I can't play at all!!! It shuts down before I can even see my land. Please fix this ASAP!
B005HSL626|5.0|Always wanted to play fruit ninja but dont have a touch screen phone soo happy to have in on my kindle :)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Some of Clancy's later books seemed contrived but this plot kept me on the edge of my seat. I fully enjoyed it & recommend it.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|This is Maiden in their prime, i love this video, not crazy about the second disk, but still great show.
B002JI94J4|2.0|This is for the \\"Blu-Ray Collector's Edition\\". There is no upgrade in picture quality; and the audio is terrible. The regular DVD release has much better audio & same picture quality as blu-ray. Save money with DVD & have a better product.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Excellent, i´m very satisfied, it´s a great experience, 4 version of the movie, trailers, etc, a must buy. The audio and picture are clear, it's like you're in a movie theatre.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Worthless for use with Kindle Fire HD 8.7 as connectors must be different. Just another cable to use as a spare. The promo ad needs to be more specific.
0374525153|5.0|Well written.  Last sentence says it all.  Loved it.  I would read this author again.  Shared it with several friends.
0425263924|3.0|This is the first real review I have written, don't usually feel motivated but this book just made me see red. Like everyone else, I was expecting a happy ending and yeah also thought it was a trilogy WTF. The first two books set up the story beautifully but it seems she tried to up the anti and throw so much much drama and angst into this one it became really frustrating and annoying to the point I found it a lot easier to put down and go and do some other stuff whereas the previous books found me sitting up til 2am in the morning.  Loved the storyline but all the extra dramas were unnecessary.  Oh and Brett and Eva whats with inviting him up to her apartment what was she thinking, how do you think Gideon would have felt if he knew and then she goes and gets jealous over Deanna. And now she's married whats the big deal I would be letting everyone know.  Gideon is so devoted to her, lets her push him all the way and she can't even be totally up front with him. Leaves it to the last minute to tell him she's going to San Diego, and you just know she's going to meet up with good ole Brett who still seems to turn her on albeit not as much as Gideon. She so does not deserve Gideon.  I almost wish the book ends up with Cary and her all alone drinking themselves into oblivion. It would serve them both right. Her attitude just sucks. I waited so long for this book and it still isn't finished. Not sure if I can build up the enthusiasm to wait another six months or more to finish the series. For me I think Sylvia is killing it.  Has she not heard that sometimes Less is More.  At least FSOG finished in three with a happy ending. Oh and the \\"Just one Night\\" and \\"Fade\\" series would get better reviews from me than this one.  Think I'll go and find something light and fluffy to read with a happy ending just to get rid of my frustration. Ughh
B005MLOKXA|5.0|prisoners are interesting and convincing.  Glamour at the law firm is nice and seeing they need to downsize like the rest of<br />the business world is noteworthy.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie was much better than I thought and well worth the price - free with Amazon Prime.  A bit too violet for the kiddies.
B00CE379IM|2.0|Had high hopes, which almost instantly fell flat upon hearing the first actor try a southern accent.  Don't waste your time.
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|I like this album because of the dark electronic rifts and fresh sound of Charli's voice. It is different for sure, but not enough to turn you off. You do have to listen to the whole songs to appreciate the different turns they take.
125000098X|4.0|I thought this was the last in the series, so I read it as soon as I got it.  It isn't the last book and the end leaves us hanging until the next book, and we don't know when that will be out.  I'm not happy not having known this.  The book was also not as complex as the previous ones, but I love Jeffrey Archer, and the book was well worth the read.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Items you can buy are way to expensive turns me off from playing the game.Hopefully you guys can lower the prices
B000A6EXNO|4.0|The eyecup is a little difficult to install but it is worthwhile since you do not get stray light through the eyepiece when photographing.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So much for a trilogy.  This book was a waste of time. The sole purpose of this book was to set up future books. The word greed comes to mind. I pre-orderd this book back in October and expected it to wrap everything up only to get to the end and find out its not over. I will not be ordering future books in this series. At $10 a piece I have now been priced out. As an avid reader and huge fan of the \\"trilogy\\" and the story of Eva and Gideon this revelation was extraordinarily disappointing. I feel duped.  Such a shame.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book made me laugh out loud a few times. Tina Fey is obviously a very smart (and funny) woman.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Another great release from Tegan and Sara. The songs are great, especially after several listens. They grow on you, and get stuck in your head.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought this book was well done! I felt the direction of the character development of Eva and Gideon was very believable and look forward to seeing how they continue to evolve as they look to deal further with all the pain/abuse they have suffered. I love the twist the Nathan/Gideon storyline has taken and I'm looking forward to reading more about this in the next book. The secondary character storylines, in my humble opinion, did not detract, derail or distract the main story of Eve and Gideon. The one seCondary character story line I hope to see more of in the next book ***SPOILER ALERT*** is about Eva's parents' relationship. While I understand the frustration some of the reviewers have over feeling that this book would be the end of the series and the beginning of the happily ever after for Eva and Gideon, I for one am happy that I will be able to live in Eva and Gideon's world for a little while longer.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|I am a fan of Phil Collins and when I saw this one for 99 cents. I couldn't resist it.
B000007638|2.0|Virtually no high end and marred in bass. My original vinyl copy of WOA was far more dynamic than this 2013 release. This is a huge disappointment. If you must buy it, wait for a used copy to pop up. It's not worth the 15+ dollars I paid. Two stars as in two thumbs way down.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game.  I find it to be fairly user friendly. I've spent a good deal of time playing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is awesome and I just can't say anymore!  Read it, Love it and Live it!  It's put together very well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a great app. I love the cute horses. But I would like it to be easier to get diamonds.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I received the package today and noticed large cracks all over the controller. And to add insult, the left trigger is also missing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a delightful relaxation, go-to-sleep, meditation application.  One of my favorite things about it is the ability to devise one's own particular &#34;sound.&#34;  By combining say the &#34;flute&#34; and the &#34;thunder&#34; selections the user can create a sound specific selection and one can combine more than just two selections - create!.  And the variety of the choices themselves is quite broad.  I use this app for meditation, for falling asleep and I will sometimes create a &#34;tune&#34; for myself to play as background while I'm reading a book or playing a game on my Fire.  I got this free but, honestly, it is well worth paying for - great app!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|GIDEON!!!!!! LOVE HIM NEED HIM WANT MORE OF HIM CAN'T GET  MY FEEL OF HIM LONGING FOR MORE PLEASE GIVE ME MORE
B008JJM88Q|1.0|tired of apps being made just to sell off data mined by outrageous permissions. its the new scam of the decade.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We enjoyed the movie. It was a good action with some light-heartedness also. It wasn't the usual Bruce Willis movie.
B004C03L4G|5.0|I love this book. I own 2 copies of the print edition and now the Kindle edition too. Having the Kindle edition means having one less book to cram into my already full suitcase. Hurray for the Kindle edition that helps me go get a regular dose of angel medicine whenever I want.
B009RH9HDS|3.0|LOVE THE COLOR... NICE AND STURDY. ONLY DOWN SIDE IS IF YOU HAVE IT FOLDED FLAT THE BATERY DOES NOT GET AIR FLOW AND IT CAUSES THE KINDLE TO HEAT UP. AT FIRST I THOUGHT MAYBE THE KINDLE WAS DEFECTIVE BUT ONCE I USED IT W/OUT THE COVER I DIDNT HAVE THAT PROBLEM ANYMORE.<br /><br />I USE IT WHEN I TAKE IT TO PLACES WITH ME- ITS BRIGHT ORANGE SO I ALWAYS KNOW WHERE ITS AT!
B00CLOTNLK|5.0|I love to hear new progressive rock. Very proud of Simon Collins, Phil Collins son. Every song is just great!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I didn't want to write a review, I just wanted to give this book 5 stars because it's great. Word.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is fun and entertaining. The only thing I found is that sometimes it exits the game automatically and that for the daily challenges it never presents the second challenge and I don't know why. It is better then temple run because you do not have to tilt for moving to the side. I like the animation and updates instead of just a second Subway Surfers. I love this game and i hope you enjoy it.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I like this case because it does a great job of protection..and.. I can find a position to set it on so I don't touch it while reading..(when I do it turns many pages and is hard to find ones place.. it's a good case
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Rich detail and exciting storyline. Huge fan of Sanderson's work. Can't wait for its sequel, regardless of length. Epic potential, surely to occupy some shelf space next to Jordan/Sanderson's Wheel of Time.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It's got to be hard to put a long and beloved series to bed, but this book was probably the worst in the series.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Top Gun is still a great move even though it was produced in the 80’s. It might seem like a dated move, however the fighter combat Tactics have not changed. The aerial visuals Action in the film is among the best capture to date. The look and feel of the then and still high performance F-14, with its great photogenic qualities; look better than Tom Cruise. Aside from the action in this film, the friendship, and love story are not bad for a movie of this type. The talent of the actors helps to bring this part of the move to light. It’s a great movie and probably will become a classic in the mean time it’s a great film to watch over and over.<br />Now for the technical aspect of the movie, First of just running it through a Blu-ray player and running it through a true home theater do make some differences as well as running it trough different brands of Blu-Ray players<br />Starting with sound if you just pop it into a Blu-ray player and us the TV speaks the sound is all right. Ran it through Yamaha home theater and the sound improved. I’m sure it is true for other brands as well. The standard edition DVD and even a VHS copy lets loose with crushing bass that can be felt as much as heard through an older 5.1 w/subwoofer system. If you jack the sound all the way up you can feel the general sounds of an F-14 carrier take off and flight. The sound technicians could have done a better job for this release.<br />The problems start coming up when you go to Blu-ray 3D, some scenes are grainy especially the opening scene on the carrier flight deck as well as low light sequences, this is regardless of Flat screens TV used. The most graininess was on my Seki TV, which is my cheapest flat screen in the house.<br />Final thoughts if you have the DVD the 3D Blu-ray is not worth getting!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I recommend this book as a great Summer read!  I enjoyed this book just as much as I have enjoyed any Charlaine Harris book.  Her books are always fun, quick reads.  I just can't believe this is the last Sookie Stackhouse book!  I hope Ms. Harris changes her mind and continues with Sookie's story!  I understand that a character can get to be tiresome to an author, but I hope Ms. Harris will continue with Sookie once she has taken a break and had some distance from the subject!  This book did end a little up in the air so I hope Ms. Harris wrote it that way to allow for her to go back and write more about Sookie, if she so chooses.  I think Charlaine Harris books are perfect for Summer reading.and this book is no exception!  It was fast paced, funny and quirky!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this is probably one of the best books i've read since perks of being a wallflower. i'd give it 1,000,000,000,000 thumbs up if i had that many thumbs!
B000I3P3EM|5.0|Nothing left to say it is the best star trek movie ever I have however not seen the new one Into the Darkness I think is the name but I like the original crew who doesn't right. But I would have to say the new crew is great they have taken the story to the next level.
B00170M2JY|5.0|This movie is a classic. I've probably watched it a few hundred times. Should check it out if you haven't seen it yet.
B00821OX98|5.0|I hope that like so many other shows on TV we don't see this turn into a night time soap opera. It is well done and the science fiction show is just that science fiction. It is a great story and I hope we don't see to much more deception by our own as this would detour from what is a great show so far, we would of course face trials and tribulation of an unseen magnitude but I do believe that man kind would fight as a whole not apart no matter how scared we where. So a little goes a long way for me can't wait for the next installment hope it will be available for purchase on Amazon so I can watch with everyone else I don't get cable here so I use the Amazon unbox to stay in touch with my favorite TV.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I was a little skeptical before watching this movie which made it that much better. Highly recommended if you haven't seen it yet.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I have been listening to Megadeth for years. This one rocks. Great riffs, drums, and lyrics. They certainly don't sound like they did 20 years ago which is good. I don't like bands that constantly sound the same (except Motorhead), so I was pleased when I got this one and I can't wait for the next one. I specially liked this version of Cold Sweat.
0425263924|2.0|I absolutely loved Bared to You and Reflected to You and was exstatic about EWT! Boy was I severly disappointed :( This book seemed to drag on and on and never really had a plot. I kept wondering why and thought that something had to get better soon. Then I was on the last chapter and realized that Sylvia did not right this book for her fans, which is really sad. There is no ending and this book to me is one of the worst that I've read. The only reason I gave it two stars is b/c I was in love with Gideon and Eva. Their big 'Ido' moment was horrible and nothing like what either of them deserved and what the fans fantasized about! My heart is broken b/c I really looked froward to a spectacular FINISH! I guess since Sylvia got the tv gig for this series she had to drag the story and I mean d...r...a...g... the story!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Reading this series and having to wait so long between each book. What's worse is this book didn't focus as much on Gideon and Eva as much as I would have liked especially with all that went on in the last book but I'm still hooked and love this series but I just wish it's not 6 plus months in between each book.
B00C5ZORES|4.0|Got this album after previewing a couple songs - I've probably listened to it 50 times over the first month or so
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I DID TOBUSCUS. How did it guess tobuscus? I did nyan cat. and what do ya know? NYAN CAT. this app is so amazing and time passing GET IT.
B00BUT5I84|3.0|I had huge hopes for this album and besides the first three tracks it was just a glide.... I have a huge variety in the music I listen to... I can listen to Slipknot and Maroon 5 I have albums from both artists and along with 30 seconds to mars I have all their albums and this band is in my top five of most favorite bands but this but this album is not good it's flat generic not what 30 seconds to mars is. that being said Jared Leto has an amazing voice and that is the best part of the whole album the best tracks are... in order from best to not as good..... 1. Conquistador 2. Up In The Air 3. Do Or Die 4. Birth that the only songs I really enjoyed... for the most part.... it's just so sad... I hope this album grows on me but it's... it's just not very good. :(
B001MS7IBS|5.0|The first season is still my favorite, but everything about this series is worth watching. Sci-Fi at it's very best.
1878424319|5.0|This book is a very easy read and inspirational.  I have given it to several loved ones as well and recommend that everyone read it and make the world a better place!!!
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|Absolutely profound. If I could give another star or two to this CD I would.<br /><br />Obviously part of how we discriminate music is based personal taste; and I have enjoyed Mr. Lukather's work since his days at Grant High School.  That said, even if the style isn't your cup of tea (I don't know how it couldn't be...) the level of craft and art transcends tastes and genres.<br /><br />If you are thinking about the purchase, go for it, there is no disappointment.  After a couple of listens you will be hooked.  If you play guitar, your fingers will gently weep.
B00005V9HH|5.0|I gave it five stars (very RARE) because...<br />Nothing is what it seems to be...it is a movie for intelligent people and I bought it because at the end your are going to be saying WHHAAAAAATTT!!  If you one see it one time you are seeing a magic trick.  And if you left scratching your head;  You know you're going to have to see it a second time to understand it from the first.  After I saw it I bought it immediately and I have an outstanding memory...but...<br />AAAWWWWHH! I don't want to give it away...and they hardly put a mystery in front of me that flummoexs me.  I am a voracious reader and love all the major mystery writers...I hate what they have done with James Patterson mysteries...it has the wrong person in the lead Cross isn't that old and they left out some of the major characters that help define the character....but oh, well, I read the book.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|I have made it through season 1 and on my way through 2. I love this character and can relate to him in so many ways...uhh not that I've ever taken out the trash the same way he has. I'm not a big fan of profanity but somehow when Deb does it its even cute. Yeah I love this show,it's an escape after real life! :)
B00005N5S2|5.0|MacArthur is HISTORY...whether or not you like or didn't like him (I am old enough to remember) is irrelevant like Patton.  It is a historical time and if you don't think it is accurate, then read some books.  I don't like Oliver Stone's movies because in some cases I knew the people and I knew they were not anything like the movie...such as Nixon.  But one remembers people they see in movies and the intelligent ones that like historical accuracy will learn and not just take the word of the movie.  I think this is a pretty accurate movie.  My uncle was on Bataan and when MacArthur evacuated, since my uncle was a typist in HQ, he went with the MacArthur Entourage when they evacuated.  He was so lucky because the Bataan death March (1942 the year I was born.) Tortured and killed thousands of soldiers.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Some good messages that caring makes a difference in a story line that doesn't lead one to believe such would arise.  Well acted with great special effects.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|The Shifting Fog is a beautifully written book set in modern times, with constant shifts back to England in the early to mid 1900s. As usual Kate Morton draws the reader into the story, making it hard to put the book down, and has a well thought out twist at the end that is impossible to predict. The only thing I disliked about this book is that, although it is a full length novel it doesn't seem long enough, and is read too quickly!
B00CW665VI|4.0|I've never read a &#34;love story&#34; from HIS point of view, and I loved the perspective. And surprisingly funny - I'd love to talk to the author and find out how she put herself in &#34;his&#34; mindset so convincingly! Good plot and I enjoyed the background characters too! Definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read!
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|Carlos Vives always satisfies!<br />Great album love the sound so much fun definitely worth buying if your a loyal Carlitos or want to try some great Spanish sounding music with heat instruments in the background!
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Movie was fun, predictable and a good escape for a short time. The actors never seemed to get too serious about themselves and all seemed to have fun. Hey - not every movie is going to be Oscar worthy, but at least it should be entertaining.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Durability 2.5/5<br /><br />The reason is the links that connect the earpiece breaks. To me it seems the weak point is if you ask me is the swivel that makes the earpiece able to tilt. No matter how much you take care of it will still break. The Mic will begin to slide and not stay in place. Meaning it will not stay mid way or where you want it. The mic will actual move to its lowest position and you have to bend the wire to where you want it.<br /><br />Sound 3.5/5<br /><br />The sound is good. You can adjust the the bass, master sound, and the people chatting.<br />Directional sound is good. Easy to hear people running by, or the direction of the shots.<br /><br />Now talking on the MIC is a different story. It seems depending on the day is how well people can hear you. I had to adjust the volume for chat on my ps3 all the way up. (Having a wireless blue tooth I could have it set mid way)<br /><br />Note this the above is on a PS3 perspective.<br /><br />Now I have been through 2-3 sets over the years.  Now on my last one. When they broke I glued it together it seemed to help a lot with the durability.
0307895475|5.0|I bought this guide and im really impressed at the shape it was in though it was missing the world map poster was still great buy thanks so much.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Read the book so wanted it for my Kindle (iPad) Was very disappointed to find parts of book missing. Will just have to buy the book.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|Daft Punk and I go back 10+ years so I thought I knew what to expect. Instead I was surprised to find every track a relaxing blend of soothing electronica and haunting lyrics. This album is ideal for pre-dinner party tunes, sipping hot tea around a fire pit and other adult pursuits. Fans looking for discotheque club music will unfortunately be disappointed.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I can not believe it!<br /><br />I like everyone else has waited and waited and waited and all for nothing... As I neared the ending I realized this book was nothing but fluff and nothing good was going to come out of it and that although it was released as a trilogy, more books would be made and I must say I feel duped!<br /><br />I dont feel like anything major happened. The story has been stretched out and I agree with everyone else that it is a ploy to get more money. Great authors dont suck the life from a story in order to make more money. This story should have been finished with an ending for all<br /><br />I rather read a 500 to 600 page story with a proper ending than read 300 pages of pure fluff. Disappointed is an understatement.<br /><br />Megumi and Cary are left as cliffhangers while nothing really went on between Gideon and Eva except for endless pages of sex.. It gets to a point where you are just plain tired of reading the sex scenes and you skip to the story line...<br /><br />I am pleased to see that this book generated so many negative reviews and I hope the author takes heed and does something about it... If we have to buy another book she should at least make it longer and actually finish the story
B000OONQ9O|5.0|One of my 3 favorite movies of all time, have it on dvd, and blu-ray. This is one of the movies they should NEVER remake, but they will and will most likely mess it up. A lot of action, even good soundtrack for people who like all genres of music. Everyone should watch this movie, one of the all time greatest.
B0026KX5PO|4.0|Love the style and feel of this movie. It is well directed and acted. Matt Damon and Jude Law were great.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Classic horror movie, looks great on blu-ray. First 2 halloween movies, are my favorite ones. Can't go wrong with Donald Pleasence(rip), Jamie Lee Curtis, and the great John Carpenter
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse is great for every day use and for gaming. The color LEDs are nice effect and not overly bright. My only complaint with this is the right button is a little to sensitive. On more than one occasion I've blown myself up in a game just resting my finger on the button. I worked around it by remapping that button to a different one. Overall its a good buy.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Bought this for my god-daughter, she loved it. Even help me put it together.....it was fun, very nice barbie beach house for kids.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Kind of buggy, always trying to get you to pay for upgrades.  Graphics are nice though.  Same as most games these days.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|This Halloween movie, might be my favorite one of the collection. Movie is still as good as it was, when I first watched it when I like 6(grew up a horror fan) Blu-ray makes it look even better. Old school halloween &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; new school
B0067R0APK|5.0|I check here every morning before I make plans for the day. I've learned I can count on AccuWeather to be pretty accurate. Thank you!
0425263924|3.0|I jumped up and down like a kid at Christmas when I saw the book was downloaded to my Kindle a day early.  Yippee!!!  I raced through the book -- and then you left us hanging??!!  It's almost as if you ran out of time and threw a whole bunch of plot twists together at once and then just closed it up.  You rushed so many aspects, and then didn't deal with the others.  I sure hope you have the four instalment underway because you owe it to us now!
B004EBTGX8|4.0|Good plot but predictable at times. Characters well developed and interesting.  Agatha Christie s later books are more mature and interesting for adult readers.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great product, Excellent service, I rocked out so hard to this album that my eyes and ears started to bleed!
B000YDIA00|5.0|You dont often see a lot of Timberland's that show simplicity and comfort.<br />I wanted something that wasn't too 'showy', comfortable, with durability.<br />So far, these shoes met my expectancies.<br />Shoe for the office, traveling, just to hang out with nice shorts and polo top on, awesome shoe all around.<br />And when my shoes need replacing, I will definitely buy this pair again.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I. Have followed this series from the beginning and it never gets old. Nalini finally gave us our Ghost and he was fabulous. The storyline moved so quickly that before I knew it I was on the last page and crying for more.  I loved it and pray that she starts writing faster. One book per year is not enough. And Kalebs HEA was perfect.  No other woman would've been right for him. I hope that Vasic gets the next book.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I wish there were more levels on this. Other than that, a great selection of tile set-ups; albeit not very many.
0765367297|3.0|Not sure what to make of this one actually, I love the Halo milieu, enjoyed the live action series, &#34;Forward Unto Dawn&#34;, immensely unfortunately for me Nylund's writing style left me feeling ambivalent to the tale. If his hands were truly tied by the creative team at Bungie, then he is only partly to blame. A series of military gaffes had me grumbling somewhat, as an example: after serving in the military (USN) I know that an officer only salutes a NCO only if that soldier has won the Medal of Honor. The shortage of Spartan Officers has always bothered me, as first-rate troops need to be led from the front, knowing the &#34;old man&#34; is in the thick of it with the grunts aids greatly in keeping morale steady in the face of terrifying odds. Finally the tie-in with HALO Reach is somewhat confusing, as the role of the Pillar of Autumn seems at odds between the book and the game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have loved the first two books and was excited about the end of the story.  If it would have ended with the a wedding I would have been happy!  However there are two more books on the way and since I am so in love with the characters and story line I am excited for them.  It was a great book and I completely loved it!!!! If you haven't read the series you are crazy and should start it now ;)
B000U6BT40|5.0|&#34;Fringe&#34; meets comedy. What a great idea!  The show is funny, intriguing, quirky, and the cast is just fantastic.  I can't even pic a favorite character! They all have their charm. This one surprised me. I expected it to be silly.  It's very well done.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Once again Gideon and Eva steam up the pages! The rest of the story left me wanting more but that is what books 4 & 5 are for I guess.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Almost gave 4 stars but my wife didn't let. A great traditional style action movie with a better than average plot plus some classic Bruce Willis.
B0091REZMW|3.0|plenty of rooms to search for items but not many items in each room.  new to the game though.  hope it gets better.
B006FYHTFO|5.0|It took me way too long to order this, but I'm glad I did the digital download to listen to it right away. I love Sherlock Holmes and this is a must if you enjoyed the movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Read the book before you see the movie. Book is spectacular. Easy quick read that is darkly funny. Matthew Quick is a wonderful author. Great for adults but can be read by teens as well.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great! except disc 2 in season one did not play. I was going to return it but couldn't part with the other discs.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was looking forward to the conclusion of Gideon and Eva but after reading I'm ok with the next installment as long as we don't have to wait as long as we did for this one.  I would have given it five stars if it had an ending. Giving it three stars because who knows when the others will be released.
B000WC3864|5.0|It is exactly as expected, came with a cool movie poster and was in great condition, I like this movie and can't wait for the remake
B0013FFMOK|1.0|The DVD was scratched and skipped half of the movie. ( I have a brand new dvd played and no problems playing other movies)
B009H5IS1W|3.0|I don't like the &#34;female' victim as the constant theme-with few exceptions.  However, I understand that females are more often the victim of male predators. SAD!!
0896762629|5.0|I have 3 Janet Arnold books, and this one does not disappoint.  I was pleased to see most pictures were in color and had many close ups of details.  Worth every penny!
B0045HCIZY|5.0|I got Before Sunrise and Before Sunset to watch on recommendation from a friend because the third of the trilogy, Before Midnight, just came out this year, 2013 and is in theaters.  I enjoyed watching both movies, Before Sunrise, the first and Before Sunrise, the second one 10 years later and now will go see the third and final one, 8 years from the second one, with same case of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy of course.  I recommend.........Intereting and well done trilogy......Joan
0896760839|4.0|As usual Janet Arnold's attention to detail in her books does not disappoint.  This book I was a little disappointed in having bought the book on accessories first, I was expecting to see full color pictures like that book.  This must have been written earlier when they had a tighter budget...no color pictures.  Still though, many details and black and white pictures.  The patterns are very useful and the book will work for my project.
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|This is a really great CD and I am so glad to add it to my cd library. Thanks for making it available.
B005HEK3JW|4.0|HD STAR TREK is great. thanks for making it free Amazon. if you haven't watched this series and you like star trek, you should start.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Read the book a few summers ago and I was so excited to hear it was going to be a movie.  I never made it to the theater to see it, really wish I had.  Enjoyed it at home just as much tho.  Book was better.  Movie was good!  I recommend reading the book before you see the movie for sure!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. it is so fun to use!!! I love caring for my horse. it is so life like.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie! Myself, my husband and our 3 teenage sons! Can't wait for the next one!!!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|What a fast paced movie thiis is.......superb acting from Denzel and John Goodman....Don't blink, you might miss something good....The story holds together well......I loved it.....I think you can tell and I highly recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates a good story, well told with lots and lots and lots of good acting going on......Nice effects too, very believable.....<br />Good  good ending.......
B008QLXSG8|1.0|Matthew Ward should forfeit all rights to translate anything for the rest of his career. What a shallow and weak translation of Camus' work.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Although it uses the same camera, it does take better images of the document and one that you can safely share and make it legible to read. Thanks for agreta app!
B0094K1QR8|5.0|We haven't had a chance to sit and watch a movie int eh 2 years since our son was born - I usually fall asleep 10 minutes after the sun goes down or he does.  He spent the night with family and this was our &#34;date&#34;.  It was a great fun movie... witty and fast moving, so it held my attention and I wasn't even tempted to doze off.  Really enjoyed it!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|5 star rating.  we watched it via  netflex.  But it helped me to see I wanted to see this movie. Removed it from things to watch via amazon.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Git this when was free app have had on several phones. Never had issues and like the options that are offered.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This i have been wanting forever and they finally got it im so happy its a fun game and recommend for everyone!!!!!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Didn't think I was going to really like the movie and to my surprise I loved it. I work in community service and everyday I work to lift folks up that had missed opportunities. The one thing Django showed me was that heroes can be the most conflicted people. When they are given a chance to be heroes, they are truly heroic.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|overall ok but the Greek issue makes it unworkable.  If they change the font then it will get my 5 stars
B003XRELEI|5.0|Geat novel about colorful characters and brilliant observations of America. Although it took place in the 70s, many truths still apply.
B005HF0GKC|5.0|The story is interesting, incredible, and made more fascinating by the fact that it is based on a real-life story. The story is told from an interesting perspective that makes having psychic abilities seem much more gritty and everyday believable. I am hooked and in the middle of watching season after season.
B005544V6A|5.0|Awesome show!  Watched the entire season in 2 days, can't wait to see Season 2, though don't like that I have to pay to watch it!
B009JZWWGC|4.0|My wife and I are Star Trek fans. If watched in order, which we just did, it is fun to see the progression both in technology and story line. Since the 2013 movie version (prequel) we have reviewed all of the movies. Great fun.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|It is a great product. The only problem I had was that I had to download it again for some reason.
1594204217|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but my husband devoured - pun intended - it on arrival.  It's on my to do list for summer reading.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|The whole of it is fun and cute. I haven't had a problem with it. Good game indeed. Love it!
0425263924|2.0|I won't go on and on with the same reviews as others but will say that I'm pretty disappointed with this book. I'm not even going to complain about the cliffhanger that was not supposed to be.  What I will say is that this book dragged. I ended up with more questions than answers.  It's like she took this book and dragged it into 2 more. A lot of details that were irrelevant to the story.  Big disappointment.  If she was going to drag the book out, at least give it more substance.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I really like this product. I am waiting for further updates so it can get better. I haven't been able to try it in my tablet to see how it goes, but in my Gs3 it works good enough.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|If you love LOST, you know the first three seasons were amazing! If you really love LOST, you stick it out to the very end and walk away feeling like questions were left unanswered. Nonetheless, the first three incredibly-written seasons are worth the somewhat disappointing end.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|A perfect new installment to this series. Where a murdering sociopath shows his romantic side, the pacing and sexual tension is captivating. Highly recommended for any paranormal romance fan.
B002QNTNL6|3.0|Fun movie will be enjoyed most by teens and their families young adults may also enjoy<br />No oscars for this one though
B007SGM084|5.0|I've gotten away from reading for pleasure a bit... This was a delightful and very arousing way to return to. :-)
B008602KQI|3.0|It's okay. Good for a Sunday afternoon but surely will not go in history as an epic one. Poor recreation of the written version.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Too many cell phone games suck, mostly because they try to shoehorn their game concept into the touch interface.<br /><br />Happily, Fruit Ninja is the opposite. This is a game made first and foremost for touchscreens. You slash fruit by swiping your finger, accumulating points for combos and special fruits. But don't swipe too carelessly - a game-ending bomb could always be a moment away!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I've liked Daft Punk since they first appeared years ago.  This new album is a real departure from past ones and both surprises and delights.  Their are a number of surprising collaborations including Giorgio Moroder snd Paul Williams which surpass expectations. Moroder discusses his early efforts to produce an album that describes the music of each past decade and then the music of the future.  Daft Punk seems to have done exactly this with their new release with great effect.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I've been a huge Dave Matthews Band fan for the last 17 years. I picked Phillip from his first audition. He does remind me of Dave. He stayed true to himself thru the entire American Idol process. No transformation needed to him. Love this album, hope there are many more in the same spirit. Can't wait to see Phillip open for John Mayer this summer.
B002M87V0A|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals of all time!  The music is so lovely and lively!  Performers so believable!!  Wonderful costuming too! Our kids performed this as a play in high school and had such a delightful time--as did we in the audience!<br /><br />LOVE IT!!!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I would not recomend. Hp tried to sell me a different printer when I called them. It requires a Printer compatable with it. It is not compatible with all HP printers
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|No big departure from previous work, but if you love Joe's other stuff you'll love this. I don't think Joe can put out a bad album, I bought it before hearing it, not disappointed!
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Moving between London of 1941 and a regional town during 1961 and 2011, a mother's secret is finally revealed to her eldest daughter.  And what an unexpected twist.
0812993845|2.0|I have read most of her books and really like them but this one is not her best.  All her books have a ridiculousnes to them that makes them a funny light hearted read. This one is so ridiculouis though its almost uncomfortable to read.  I didnt really like any of the characters and basically made myself finish it on principle. Hopefullly her next one will be back to her normal fun read.
0345803485|5.0|These books were wonderful.  I could not put them down.  I am very busy but I sacrificed sleep to read these books.  They are not literary genius but they told a great story.  Book 2 is the best of the 3.  And book 3 could have been made into 2 or 3 books.  I would like to read this from Christian's prespective next.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Wheat is such a huge part of the American diet that it is hard to imagine that the food industry and their cohorts in Agribusiness have let a GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) compromise the health of millions of innocent people around the world. Dr. Davis links the exponential rise in Type II diabetes to the introduction of the &#34;new wheat.&#34;<br />Some of the tests, reportedly conducted to establish the link between wheat and specific health issues could be better described and documented.<br />This is required reading for everyone who is diabetic, pre-diabetic or diagnozed as gluten intolerant. The menus and recipes are delicious alternatives to the risks of a &#34;Wheat Belly.&#34;
8186336141|5.0|I think that having to write a review of x amount of words is not such a good idea. The product was good  but I dont want to spend heaps of time setting out my thoughts on paper so I will cut and past this onto all the purchases i have made to save time. Do you get it.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|Excellent book, well written and executed. The writing style and seamless interplay between stories and genres draws the reader in and doesn't let them go until the very last sentence.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This has been fun playing back and forth with one of my daughters!  It's been sort of time together even though we are not in the same town!  Have had some laughs with it!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Leaving this review to get tickets. I don't like that we have to post stuff on Facebook to get stuff. Other then that it's not bad
B000000W6X|5.0|I am always satisfied when I receive EXACTLY what I ordered on time and undamaged:)I do have several other of their CDs and will purchase more in the future.
1118109791|5.0|This book is very comprehensive and great for refreshing my memory. I have been out of school for 4 years and this was very beneficial before taking the gmat.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I tried this app when first received my kindle fire hd.I would not recommend this to anyone else.This seems to be too limiting.
B0000524CY|5.0|This movie was a gift, I don't like horror movies, so have no idea how was it.  I just know the person loved the gift.  I came look new, so because of that I will give a good evaluation.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|I know you can't remain on a mysterious island forever, but l openly sobbed when it was all over!  This show is near & dear to my heart and will always be number one!
B00CATSONE|5.0|i really loved the book and was happy to get such a good write for free. it is motivational and inspiring.
B001CTDH76|5.0|After hearing many recommendations from many friends with quite different tastes, l decided to try it out!  These are the types of shows l enjoy and books l read!  Thoroughly thoroughly enjoying the show and the characters!
B004U8VWIM|3.0|I had no idea how dark this movie was and it was hard to watch at times. But I thought Natalie Portman gave an outstanding performance and it was clear that she put everything into this role.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|There's so much l could say about this show because I've watched numerous tv shows in my 48 years and never have l felt such a strong pull and love for the characters!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Amazon, please add season 2 so I can binge watch it! Love the story lines. I wish amazon would post more content!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I have watched every episode for every season, but because this is my favorite show, l decided to add it to my personal collection!  I love these characters with all my heart!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Pro:<br />In terms of the show and the amount of content found in this boxset with extras etc, $50+ sounds more than reasonable.<br /><br />Con:<br />As for the Box itself....I am not sure if I like the foldout that much...feels a tad cheap. Also, I am totally baffled by the discs; Disc 1 has two episodes on it, Disc 2 has three episodes, Disc 3 has one episode. Blu-Rays can hold up to 50 GB if Dual Layered right?
B0018CWEYY|5.0|The twists and turns of this show and my love for the characters has made me decide to add this to my collection!  I will watch it again & again!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|A game with dinos??? Amazing!!!! It takes time to get somewhere but it is worth it. Fun, fun, fun and wait...more fun.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I was only a young boy at the beginning of the war.  I  can remember walking up and down the sidewalk to the &#34;We want Willkie&#34; slogan  with out having much of any idea of just who Wendell Willkie was.  My dad was for him;  so was I.  Lynne Olson's book really gave an excellent picture of what a great American he was.  He picture of Lindbergh was also enlightening.  I enjoyed the book.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Works the same way the iOS version does. Just a little sluggish on the Kindle Fire (1st Gen). But that's not the app's fault.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|The quality and everthing that was said was accurate...exceeded my expectations! thank you so very much now I can enjoy my Samsung galaxy tab more.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Tried watching a few times but none of us could stay awake. LITERALLY !! Don't bother paying for it or wasting your time.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|i enjoyed the book, and the characters tugged at my heart.  you follow their lives and wonder at the twists and turns.........and then<br />while you are reading and afraid to put it down it comes to an end.  I set there for a few moments and let it sink in.  And even the next day I turned the story over and over in my mind.  peace in your life is precious.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Could not stop reading. Am a psych nurse and so wonder where she gets her character's background Feel like I know them in my practice.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|An engaging historical account that guides the reader into examining the origins and foundation of our current ways of thinking. This book could cause you to swerve in your own life.
0425263924|1.0|i was actually looking forward for the third part. although the 2nd was not as good as the first one, but still i wanted to know what would actually happen to Gideon. Sadly to say that story has not moved so much; its too dragging -- stretched by hot sex scenes repeatedly either in her room or his room or anywhere else. The story itself is not intriguing and i am quite surprised to read previous reviews that it has 2 more parts - that means 5 parts all together. Is this the other way of making money, dragging the story for nothing? Sylvia is not writing generation-by-generation Outlander series. Its just about Eva and Gideon, two people who are sexually drawn to each other, that's it. I am half way of this book and it doesn't really hold me to finish it till the end or wait for the next part. After reading Reflected in you, i waited months for this one and by the time it came, I completely forgot other characters than Gideon and Eva. I agree with the previous readers, too much hype was created over social media but 5 parts all together - it's hard to buy knowing each book is above ten bucks. The author should have a mercy on readers - its not about money making all the time.
B005H9B44A|2.0|Decent actors and effects could not salvage this entirely predictable plot with cardboard characters. Glad it came to me free on Prime.
B005LAII12|5.0|this is a good movie. ted is outrageous, fun, playful and mark wahlberg is also hilarious in this movie. thanks
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Being an avid runner, an addict for sure, I discovered this book when looking to read something from the ultramarathonman, Dean Karnazes.  This book reviewed well, so knowing nothing of Scott Jurek, I ordered the Amazon version.  I was immediately drawn into the mostly chronoligical tale of his life and his race experiences expertly co-authored by Steve Friedman.  Although Scott is a legend with an amazing resume of ultra race wins, he is also a human being with a very human experience that many can relate to.  I appreciate that he bared all and found it very easy to bond with his vulnerability.  I think his references to his mother got me the most choked up, since she inspired him with her tragically long battle with MS which eventually took her life at an early age.  Scott adventured to places that most of us can only dream of, driven by his deep desire to push beyond all limits long after most have thrown in the towel.  The spritual angle of the book I found most appealing; going beyond the physical realm of running into the largely mental realm of ultras.  I also was very inspired by his veganism, having been a vegan for nearly 10 years in the 90s, and how he used his purefied diet to help propel him to amazing running feats and rapid recoveries.  As a runner, I can easily say that is an area I could improve on, I tend to use high mileage as license to pound bad calories rather than considering a much higher quality diet as Scott espouses.  The recipes were a great touch (looked delicious, can't wait to try) and I loved the nuggets of running advice; another great aspect of this book.  Overall, extremely well crafted, by many talented hands, first and foremost by Scott himself who provides the \\"meat\\" by his amazing journey of nearly 40 years and counting.  Great work -- highly recommended to all!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|With the unbelievable genius of this album, we can only hope that this talented artist continues to move us as much as she did with this for years to come.  I bought this on digital, CD, Vinyl, and DVD!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book is well written and the plot is well thought out and it develops in a way that definitely kept me reading.  I could not put it down!  It is an emotional ride!  This book is dark--but a very good read.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A reminder that joy can be found at the darkest of times. Never stop living life to the fullest. What a great message!
B0086HGW42|5.0|Purchased this on a daily deal from Amazon.  Every single track on this CD is great.  Would buy it again full price.
0385349831|5.0|Again, this was a gift for a friend. So don't know anything about it. The person I got it for gives this book 5 stars.....very good.
B00633PFQC|5.0|I loved Michael Sandel's book, Justice so it is no surprise that I also like What Money Can't Buy.  The book examines the ways market values have replaced all other values in contemporary American society.  My favorite quote and a fair one sentence summary of the book's core idea is:  &#34;We have drifted from having a market economy to being a market society.  The difference is this:  A market economy is a tool--a valuable and effective tool--for organizing productive activity.  A market society is a way of life in which market values seep into every aspect of human endeavor.  It's a place where social relations are made over in the image of the market.&#34;  The book's focus is on what is lost when market values replace other values and the kind of society that produces.  The fundamental question everyone needs to ask  is whether the market society we are becoming is the society we want..
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is an extraordinary drama filled with humor a well as pathos.  I strongly recommend reading the book even more so than seeing the film  The film is eye-candy the book: soul candy!
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|Dont waste your time. About 20 minutes into it I lost any and all interest. A 8 year old could do a more interesting film.<br />I guess if you like watching a couple filming each other having sex it would be great..teenage sex film.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Very dissapointing.  I guess she is one author I will cross off my list. .  The ending could have been so much more.
B005FITIK0|5.0|DVD was in excellent shape, and shipped promptly! Got it earlier than expected, and it was a real life saver for a demonstration I needed it for
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book and had it preordered months ago. I loved the first two books (despite their similarity to E.L. James' series) and had high hopes for Entwined to you. However this book, although well written, was meant to conclude a trilogy and now is being made into a longer series. The book just abruptly stops with no real conclusions made at all. It seems really unnecessary to have written it this way and disappointing to the readers who expected some sort of closure. Now it seems we will have to wait for two more books! I really doubt that I will buy the next books in this series.<br /><br />There were many repetitive scenes in this series that borrows heavily from Fifty Shades of Grey which came out on May 25, 2011 almost one year BEFORE Bared to you on May 28, 2012. The comment about them coming out on the same day in the interview posted on this page is not correct, the original publication of Fifty Shades came first. There is too much similarity for it to be a coincidence, I've read both series books more than once and the Crossfire story keeps blurring into the Fifty series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Intense ending,  and great deception. The whole story moved from one theory to another finally landing on district thirteen. What will happen next
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The first two chapters were difficult in that the tenor was off. Coming too close after Eva's discovery made it understandable. But there is an inflection in the dialogue that had to be there for me to get into it after waiting so long for the book's release. I am really disappointed Ms. Day didn't find a way to wrap this up. Don't get me wrong, I loved reading about Gideon and Eva, but I feel as if too many events have been introduced that could really spiral out of control making this story go on past the point of  really enjoying it. Contrary to how this review might sound, I did like the book and will pre-order #4 as soon as it is available.
B005FFW46S|3.0|I really love Sir Pratchett's work in general and discworld in particular. Sam Vimes is one of my fictional heros, so I expected to love this novel. Unfortunately, it reads like a good imitation of a discworld novel. I'm likely not spend time to reading the next in the series unless someone I know and trust passes on it first.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It wasn't as exciting as previous books, but I still enjoyed it.  I will definitely buy the last book that checks on all the characters and where their life has taken them! To each his own.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I Love the super heros I Have been Watching this program from the start. I am a big SYFY fan will keep watching
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Just a very solid book all around.  Informative while at the same time entertaining.  Great character development and interesting developments.
B002RT85RW|5.0|They all burn & movies look great. The white surface makes for great printed discs....just ordered another stack. The only complaint is with Amazon having a minimum of words necessary to submit a review. How much more can you say about a disc?
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|We put this on all three of my childrens' Kindle Fires. After they pass a certain level (very early in the game), they are required to hookup to Facebook it appears. I am still investigating it. But all three kids have gotten the same message now. We don't allow our children on Facebook, so they can't play after that level. May be worth buying it for more $$ and not having the Facebook issues.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this. The pace of the story was awesome and I got lost in it for hours. Definitely recommend.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I can't stop playing this game, it's fun and entertaining. Can't give it 5 starts because if you delete it you will lose all your upgrades and because if you install in more than one device you can't link out so you don't have to start all over again.<br />Overall is a great application.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome appp. it would be funner if you could give the horses a bath. Other than that i love this game
1569242739|5.0|I am not vegan.<br />But I wanna try out new recipes... This book is not just delicious but so funny thsa you can read it over and over while your cupcakes are in the oven.<br />Many of the ingredients are not hard to find at all, you will even have most of them already if you are an enthusiastic cooker.<br />Totally worth, for the recipes and for the easy write !
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I was hesitant about this show at first, but after watching I'm completely obsessed! Beware though, definitely not a show intended for the faint-hearted or weak stomachs.
0385342039|5.0|Kinsella is back again after her Sophaholic serie.<br />This book is funny but also touching, I think more mature.<br />Very easy to read, hard to keep your sleeping time during it....<br />Loved, loved, loved.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Read the headline.  It was free and I like Sudoku, so I downloaded it.  But I don't play the regular Sudoku ever.  I play the Puzzle.  It's a great variation on the game.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|It's fun, but I think I liked it better on the Dreamcast back in the day. A pretty good port though.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This story could have so easily ended with this book and I'm very disappointed that it didn't.  And, I hear there's to be TWO more books. WTF for? I seems obvious to me that the author is running out of material for this particular story line and is just stretching it out needlessly so for more sales. I guess it's true what they say, \\"The Love of Money is the Root of all Evil.\\"  Instead of giving the fans what they wanted, making sure they were satisfied she preferred to water down the story making it weak and unsatisfying and honestly not worth the wait. Don't buy this one, I suggest waiting for the last one, hopefully that will be the book worth waiting for. This was so NOT!
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Ryan Gosling and plot...in that order.Acting great, ordering service simple and accurate. Sean Penn can act like the most vicious man in the world!!!
125000098X|4.0|This is the third in the series and there is one more--at least. It has been a joy to read this series. It is well done with plot(s) that keep you turning the pages to see what happens next. This is a wonderful series.<br /><br />J. Robert Ewbank author \\"John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms\\" and \\"Wesley's Wars\\"
B005544V6A|5.0|Love this show as a relaxing end to the day! hoped to have seen more of Grandma- Loved her also
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|What can you say about Downton Abbey?  Best show ever.  The acting is superb and the scenery spectacular.  I'm hooked.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|Didn't work when I got it, unless I wiggled it, but that's the chance you take getting used stuff. I didn't pay much for it, not worth sending it back. I ordered a new USED cord and it works fine. Service and delivery time were great.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|A must have for all George's fans, with touching moments and rare footages highlighting the loving life of George Harrison.
8866130923|5.0|Great buy, excellent delivery as always. The produuct was perfectly described at amazon's website, 100% satisfied. Waiting for next year to buy the 2014 moleskine ;)
B00014TJ7K|5.0|This is a brilliant album - as George's works always are. Every single song in this album is made to perfection.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|A great movie to watch with the grandkids.  Good over evil story that touched us all, made us laugh and root for the underdog.
0679805273|5.0|Gave this book as a graduation gift to a friend. I loved reading it even before I gave it and it was perfect for a graduation gift because my friend was not sure what she wanted to do.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|just downloaded this app and I am amaaazed how did it guess spongebob squarepants and elmo?? alittle freaked out too man..try it for yourself!
B008JJM88Q|3.0|Cute little &quot;game&quot;. As for all the permissions, besides accessing FB, etc, and allowing advertisement of their other apps (typical), another reason for accessing all your data is to be able to search for key words to answer your questions. There is apparently a parental control within the app to keep it &quot;child appropriate&quot;.  It has entertainment value as a &quot;party game&quot; as well, I'm sure, just for fun.
B00018TI5E|5.0|Well it was for my daughter and she was happy with the cd she ordered and of course ill do it again
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Well, this book was terribly unsatisfying.  I understand the love for the characters, Gideon and Eva.  I also understand the love for the first two books of the series.  I too have been waiting patiently for the next installment, and so I am very sorry to be giving a 2 star review.<br />There reasons for the two star review are simple:  poor plot/character development and price point.  This is in no way a 4 or 5 star book, and even three stars is generous.  Perhaps nostalgia and love for the characters is what is propelling the more positive reviews.  This book is just not very good.<br />Obviously, fans of the series will continue to read the next installments.  I hope that SD spins a positive on this fail and writes the 4th book in Gideon's POV while cleaning up all of the plot driven loose ends she disastrously created in thus 3rd installment.  Then, perhaps the 5th and final book in the series can tie it all together with a satisfying conclusion.<br />Honestly, this should have been a more character driven, shorter novella to set up the next plot.  It could have been released in a shorter period of time at a much lower price.  Forcing loyal fans to wait 12 months, charge $10 , and leave readers completely unsatisfied is what is driving these poor reviews.  This situation is reminiscent of my favorite shows The X-Files/Lost....amazing runs, too much disconnected plot, ultimately, an unsatisfying conclusion for a great series.<br />Really, I wanted to give the overall story 1 star, but tacked on the extra star because of my love for Gideon and Eva.  BTW....I'm on team Eva here.  Gideon messed with her heart and head in RIY, this is the result.  He needed to earn it back, regardless of his actions and motivations.  My fingers are crossed for a Gideon POV in book 4 and a satisfying book 5 all for a lower price;).......if not, then I will probably not continue to purchase these books and write my own happy ending.  My advice, wait for the library copy, borrow from afriend, or cross yor fingers for a price drop.  Do not pay $10 for this, since the odds of feeling cheated and unsatisfied are relatively high.
B001OSIV62|5.0|It's a bit sad since the towers aren't there anymore but the story itself is wonderful. The skill and braveness Philippe had to be able to cross a tight wire from one tower to the next. You should watch it!
B008OM0EDO|3.0|It's not the worst thing I've ever seen (that's reserved for Pauly Shore and Rob Schneider movies), but I probably won't ever watch this again. The entire plot and script is predictable and sounds like a room of eighth graders put it together.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|It's a fun game. It's easy to play in short intervals while waiting for a the bus, at an office or whenever. A fun take on the match 3 formula.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Cute animations and a fun alternative to using pencil and paper, but it would be more fun if it allowed for phrases and not just single words.  In the 2 player mode my husband and I were able to get around this by simply stringing words together but it would be more fun if able to space out words as in the \\"real\\" game.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|There are three features that make this app the best:<br />1. The extremely large snooze button<br />2. Ability to play your own music as the alarm<br />3. The gradual volume increase of the music<br /><br />That's it. It shouldn't be complicated. It just needs to function.
B002Y0TGOU|1.0|I have prime and received a free digital rental. After loading for a while, I got a notification that the movie couldn't download.  I was charged for it (my free download) and I never could watch it.  I've had this issue with another free rental as well. My internet connection is 2MB, so I'm not sure why it doesn't work.  I stream Netflix fine.  I never did contact Amazon, since it was a free rental and I didn't feel like messing with it.. Just an FYI, I stream from my BD Player.
B007BVMVDU|2.0|It is hard to figure out what's going on here..<br />Too much gratuitous nudity, fighting, violence, bizarre characters.<br />Not sure why this series gets so much hype..
0345529057|4.0|Super cheap way to get all four books.  The cover art is nice.  I'm not a fan of having the TV show on my books, so only four stars.  The books themselves are fine though.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I love these headphones.  My husband and I run a production company, and we had a pair that was still working, but had gotten a little beat up over the years (we had them for 6 years!), so we decided to go ahead and each get a new pair.  Still love them.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|An interesting take on these classic characters created by Robert Harris.  Definitely worth watching.  Hannibal is especially creepy here.  Though still not as good as Anthony Hopkins.  He will ALWAYS be Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have never written a review before but felt the need to voice my opinion on this huge let down. I was annoyed because I waited for months and months for this book and recommended this \\"TRILOGY\\" to all my friends.  I stayed up all night reading this book.  As it got closer to the end, I kept thinking the author is introducing all these different sub plots yet she is not answering any questions.  This book served no purpose but to prolong the series to justify turning it in to a tv show.  Truly disappointing that authors are milking readers of their hard earned money.<br /><br />Take it from me and the numerous other low rated reviews...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!<br />The Up in the Air series would be a better way to spend your money.  The author finished the main characters story in 3 books (the way a TRILOGY should be) and is now doing spin off books for the supporting characters.  They are a lot cheaper than $9.99/book.  I hope Sylvia Day reads all of these reviews and and takes them in to consideration before planning out the release of her next TWO books in this series.
B00119ZMKW|4.0|I like all of the Stargate shows.  I wish they were still one TV. I need a deviation from reality, this was one of the best.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|What can I say it is a lot different then there other albums, but I think It is great! Not every album should sound alike, and the creativity on this album shows how great this band really is. If you love Megadeth then your going to love this CD.........
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It is spot on.  Even guessed the dead parrott from a Monty Python sketch.  How the heck does it do this?????
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The stars tell it all.  My wife and I are relly looking forward to the next chapter in the story this fall.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|This is my 4th time watching LOST.  I still am looking for something on TV to be as good...never happens!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Absolutely adore this cd!!!! Huey Lewis's voice is velvety smooth. I love being able to put on this cd without having to skip any songs. It is truly a gem. So thankful amazon carried it
B0000CBHOI|5.0|i love blues, i love movies, so it is a good blend. the DVDs come in a box and all the movies are great and well produced.
B005723JSQ|3.0|I can't believe I'm rating a Sophie Kinsella book less than four stars. She's an absolute gem of a writer; her novel, [[ASIN:0440241901 Can You Keep a Secret?]] is one of my all-time favorites, but I couldn't even finish this story--and that was after skipping pages.<br /><br />I've said this in other reviews, but I think the central female character in these stories is the most important, as she sets the tone for how the novel will be read. Poppy Wyatt, the main character in this story, is just a bit too quirky. She comes off a scatterbrained and childish. She feels inferior to her fiance Mangus' family, but at times it's understandable because she does such ridiculous things. She loses her engagement ring (?!) and then as she's setting out to find it gets her cell phone stolen (again ?!), but miraculously finds a cell phone in the garbage (?!) and gives that number to the hotel staff to call her on since her mobile was snatched. When the owner of the phone, Sam, wants it back, she doesn't want to give it to him because its the only number the hotel staff have to call her on (?!). REALLY?<br /><br />On top of this, she starts answering Sam's messages on the phone--as it originally belonged to Sam's assistant--and manages to muck up his job. Did I mention she's supposed to be an ADULT?<br /><br />I believe that Poppy is to appear quirky and light and fun, but she just comes off as ridiculous. I didn't really feel as though there was a connection between she and Sam, but maybe I didn't get far enough. Much of the time, with Kinsella novels I've found that the humor and quick wit of is the main dish, while relationship development is a pleasing side item--so I don't subtract any points for that. As always, Kinsella is a great writer, this story just wasn't my cup of tea.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A wonderful book about what Nikola Tesla did for us and what hardship he encountered from many prominent people such as Edison.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I personally don't care for rod sharpeners, I've always preferred a whetstone. That being said this works very well and will allow you to hone a good edge in a short time.  I've always had trouble keeping a good edge on my ridged knives, but this product makes maintenance fairly easy.  Definitely a good buy, especially considering the price.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Different, but good.  The kind of movie that makes you think instead of just blowing things up or trying to scare you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Enjoy life and relax !!! I do with this game. Love it!!! This game is the game that keeps you on your toes with 4 boards going and you run out of bonuses you have to switch which is very convenient to flip back and forth to restore my bonuses. Thanks for easy access on your game board.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|This lens cap works perfect with the XZ-1 camera. It's better than the removable lens cap that comes as an accesory with the camera, just because you don't need to worry about loosing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I love the different tours they have. My favorite so far is miami. Could play it all day if I could. So much funnyman.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful actors. Refreshing to watch.  I loved every minute of this series.  I'm searching for another that is as much fun to watch as this was
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This 3rd book in the Crossfire series is the best one yet! I love how we learned so much more about Gideon and Eva. I am just in love with their love story! I can not wait for the next two in this series.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Watched it twice to get the full gist tho.<br />The couldn't have picked a better cast.<br />I will be purchasing this one!
B00ADMZUVO|5.0|This book gives a great insight into the lives of these extraordinary men that lived in a different time. Ambrose captures in great detail the actions and reasons of these men.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is great proof that awareness is beyond our physiology. As a neuro-surgeon, Eben Alexander, gives an objective view of the near death experience providing for those who believe the evidence to confirm it. There are a few near death books that I would recommend and this is one of them.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I adore this movie.  The writing, acting by all four leads was terrific.  Cooper and DeNiro should have won an oscar.  This is a feel-good movie.  I have seen it 4 times to date and knew from the first viewing I would have to own it.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Lucille Kent
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is definitely with reading. I have yet to view the movie, but I always try to read books prior to watching the movie. I enjoyed it and it left me wondering what was going to happen in the future.
B005IDXIL2|4.0|I love bowling,  It's good exercise and you can  make a lot of good friends and socialize after bowling, meeting somewhere for lunch.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think this book was a great and quick read! At first it starts off a little slow, but it surely picks up the pace. I will definitely be checking out her other books as well. This story definitely has some twists and turns and would make for a great movie!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I give this a 5 star rating because its filled with lots of fun and levels. No &#34;real&#34; money is necessary to play this game.<br />It's easy to play...  there is some reading required to play. I do not recommended for children under 6.<br />I down loaded it for my 5 year old daughter. we play it together. But I play it a lot more then she does.<br />The music is soothing.... great relaxing time....<br />This game is one of the best I've seen so far for a game apps ....<br />Make your own reef...  and see how many cool creatures you can attract ..  many reward bonus's throughout the game.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|All I have to say is I'm amazed but also inspired that this trilogy was created by the mind of a man. Thank you Brandon Sanderson for you have turned simple pages and words into Organic life. If anyone is reading this... by the Lord Ruler what are you doing when u can be reading the Mistborn Saga.
B001YV502C|1.0|After about 30 minutes. Can't understand the positive reviews. Dark cast and non-sensical story. A waste of money ; buy at your own risk
193700788X|5.0|I was sad that this was the last book in the Sookie saga, but the series ended in a satisfying way.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say?? A great artist with a great voice. What a pleasant surprise. Everyone will love this cd.
B009FHRRAA|3.0|It's the re-release of their first album, which is great. The additional tracks are OK at best and really I could have done without. The DVD is weak with just a few live songs. Don't feel like you are missing anything without this set. I would say you could pass on it.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I didn't realize it was same family from &#34;Knocked Up&#34;.  Very funny and if married can relate to humor very well, but would be funny regardless of viewer's marital status.  Doesn't follow regular romantic comedy plot line of turmoil and resolve, instead just follows a couple's hilarious interactions and everyday troubles. Overall good comedy and entertaining.
B005544V6A|5.0|Found and fell in love with Suits!  Watched all of Season 1 in 2 days.  Provides a unique twist on standard law show.  Hope that all seasons become available to stream on Prime.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was as excited to get back to this book everytime I was dragged away (you do have to go to work, etc) as with all all the others.  Advice though: take your time, I was able to go from book to book immediately with the rest of the volumes but now it's just sit and wait since the next one is not written and from what i've heard is not likely to be anytime soon, so again, read s l o w l y !
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Awsome show.<br />The Syfi channel executive.s should be fired for letting this show be cancelled.<br /><br />Time for them to make a movie
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I loved this book.  I picked it up on sale and wasn't sure about it at first, but two pages into the book and I was hooked.  What a great and inventive story.  The characters are developed so well.  I loved Honoria and Blade and could see them so perfectly in my mind's eye.  I enjoyed the Steam Punk version of world, an interesting alternative,  This was one of those books that when I finished the last page, I started over again with page one and re-read it.  Then I preordered the second book  ( [[ASIN:B00B2AO71A Heart of Iron]]) which was due out in just a few weeks.  Then I learned it was also available as an audio book, read by one of my favorite readers, Alison Larkin, so I bought it in that version too!  I can't wait more books in this series.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|If you're reading this review and like Match Three games, buy this game. If you don't like Match Three games, buy this game.<br /><br />Really a fun game with a lot of RPG and Endless Runner mechanics to elevate it to the next level.
B0040I09RM|4.0|The show isn't bad. Not huge into motorcycles, but we heard good things about the story line. Season one wasn't bad. We are now watching season two.
0394800184|5.0|I read this to my boys and now I'm reading it to my grandchildren. They love it just as much. A timeless classic!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|SHORT game but great play. Look forward to next game. Great graffics smooth game play. ABLE to solve in a few hours and wanted more
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|In a world where most can't even identify the real problem, Altucher outlines it clearly. Better yet, he provides a roadmap for moving forward, one daily step at a time. I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know.
B004FQX59I|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Not a big fan of Oliver Stone, but I am always captivated by this movie...I never tire of it!
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I've had this on DVD for a year or two, but it's nothing compared to BluRay. The space scenes look incredible, and it's also a really fun movie.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Love their music. A great mix of folk, alternative, and lullaby. The best feature is that the words for each song are available with the purchase of the c.d.
0425263924|3.0|I really liked the first two books and was expecting EWY to be just as good, I was disappointed. First of all I am very annoyed that we have to wait for the 4th book, and judging by the release date of EWY, it will be a long wait!<br />I felt like there was nothing new in this book, the story was just really stretched out. I can handle trilogies and like them, but I don´t like books turning into telenovelas, and I feel that is what is happening with the crossfire series.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Let me get this out of the way, this movie is beautiful to watch in that \\"future ruin\\" sort of way.  Every shot is gorgeous, and it's obvious that a lot of time and craft went into this movie.<br /><br />It's just too bad that an equal amount didn't go into the plot.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad story, it just doesn't hold up to the on-screen visuals, and the BIG REVEAL is telegraphed pretty early on.  The latter half of the movie really didn't hold much surprise.  That said, it's not like you have to park your brain at the door, the story works and the plot holds even though it's predictable.  That's why I only knocked off one star -- a little better craftsmanship and the movie would have been a roller coaster instead of a carousel.<br /><br />The acting is superb, much as you'd expect from Freeman and Cruise, and overall, the movie was a very enjoyable experience.  A very cool science fiction look at the future and a war with an alien species.  I look forward to seeing it again on Blu-Ray.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|OK, I know we have a bunch of people not happy with the ending of Entwined with You and that we will have to wait for a book four and five. I have to say that I was upset before I started to read this yesterday. After waiting months for the final book I was jumping up and down when this downloaded, to the only find out I would have to wait for more. With that being said I have to let you know that I loved this book just as much as the first two. I love how we got to see more of Gideon Cross's dark side and got the answers that we needed from book two, I love how much they love each other and would kill for their love as well. Please don't let the reviews stop you from reading this book. Even though I was happy with the ending and I am not sure what will happen in the next two books, I still can't wait for them and can't wait to know the titles and release dates..
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|ive seen the movie over and over!!great music!the cd is the musical at your fingertips in the cd player of your car!!
B0015435OI|5.0|This was a steal for the price. The gatefold artwork looks amazing and the records sound amazing. Given you can play it, this album deserves to be heard like this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!! SO ADDICTING!!! EVEN MY KIDS ARE ALWAYS ON IT!! GREAT WAY TO PASS TIME, WHILE WAITING IN THE DRS. OFFICES, BREAK-TIME, ETC!!!
B007SOQBCM|2.0|This thing needs major revamping. You can't really search or find what you want to watch with it. Or if you can, it was not readily apparent. I would not recommend unless you're absolutely so bored that you must watch a stream.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I hope he keeps making music. He has a great voice and I do enjoy his music. However his music is a bit amateur in his coming out CD. I will keep looking out and buying his music though because he has great potential.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its addicting and fun,  I really like the rare fish the plants attract. and the fact that the friends from the movie are involved.  it takes a lot of algee to feed the rare fish I think we should get more than 1 pearl from each rare fish.<br />I droped my rating to a 4 star because its hard to keep up enough algee to feed fish and grow plants.  i hope I dont loose my fish because I can't feed them
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I was trolling music on you tube and heard Daughtry on the American Idol show. I then went and listened to all his songs on the episodes. I then went to amazon and bought three CD's. He is amazing. I'm going to get all his CD's now.
B00821OX98|4.0|Finally an original series!  It's like the walking dead, but less boring, more action, and an original.  I don't know of another T.V. series where aliens have invaded Earth.  Only downside is some bad acting but it's getting better as the series goes on.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like the app. I think the graphics are beautiful and realistic :) the game is relaxing and quiet...makes for a down to earth and mindless game.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|Good solid classic rock sounding record. Of course Joe Bonnamassa is a fantastic guitar player and the rest of the band sound great.<br />Not quite as good as BCCs previous record but entertaining none the less.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My son really wanted this for his birthday!  He is in the process of putting it together now.  He was so excited to receive it!
B0012GN3RI|3.0|I like Riots early albums a lot. This record has its moments but the &#34; hair metal &#34; era just did not suit this band very well.<br />If you want to hear great classic hard rock then checkout Riots &#34; Fire Down Under &#34; record.
B00B2166BS|4.0|It does charge a little faster and its cool that it connects with magnets, but not sure if it was worth the $20.  I bought it cause I need to use the Micro USB for extra storage and charge at the same time and in that instance this puppy is awesome.  It's the only option really but I just don't know why it costs so much.  Anyway, the high price is the only reason I knocked off a star.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|Remastered and remastered right. The original mix is back on this issue and that is a good thing!<br />The 2004 remaster and REMIX was OK but something seemed a little off about it, but is still interesting to hear a different take on it.<br />The live bootleg on this issue is great, it makes you kinda feel like your in some sweaty little club hearing them back in the day. Highly recommended far any metal fan.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Hours of fun!!! I Love all the different rooms and various collection items. Slots are great fun too!! Very addictive!!!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I think this is Joe's best studio recording. Black lung heartache one of the greatest songs ever about human struggle.<br />The whole albums theme is dark and his playing just accompanys it so well.<br />Of course he is known as a great guitar player but his secret weapon is his great emotional voice.<br />Easily 5 stars and recommended for any blues rock fan.
B006M4F67A|5.0|lots of layouts to choose from, lists time takes to clear board, so you can challenge your best time. I love that there are quick layouts for potty breaks :) com' on, we all do that! and longer layouts for when you have time to concentrate a bit.
B001G8XON0|4.0|This is a movie enjoyed by those who like musicals. Solid performances from all involved, somewhat interesting story, great songs.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Bought the album for $5..... what!!!! Original music, that seems that you've heard before.... it's that good! not kid friendly though :)
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Well written tragic amazing story of addiction redemption and taking each day as it comes. Love this book read it .
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|this game has more hidden object puzzles than anything else. overall good game for price. the hidden object searches are more challenging than most games. actually had to use the hint button!.
B00006L90T|5.0|Mute your silly-detector for this story. Gorgeous B&W photography, surprisingly good for such a low-budget creepy tale of a woman who can't figure out why people can't see or hear her. I won't give away the ending. Appropriately creepy. The zombies are a little overdone, but who cares? It must have been great drive-in movie stuff back in the day.
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|This record could be the beginning of a new creative era for Bowie. The cover art certainly suggests so and the music doesn't disappoint either. If you are a Bowie fan, you will probably want to add this to your collection.
0770437400|5.0|Probably the most human, interesting, and captivating novel I've read. The individual stories make me think of how anyone else would have dealt with the impossible situations presented, I never tire of re-reading this lovingly researched exploration of global humanity. In explaining what I love about the book, I hope to segue mildly into whether the movie captures the book's spirit.<br /><br />The book opens with the unnamed UN investigator arguing with his boss about what to do with the survivor accounts from World War Z. Billions of people have died, the human race largely lost World War Z. The survivors are pitiful remnants occupying largely empty tracts of land that were once great nations. When these survivors die, the narrator argues, their stories of survival will be lost. It's a premise reminiscent of the effort to record the accounts of World War II veterans before they die, and Max Brooks is brilliant in the way he presents exciting action as a series of calm recollections.<br /><br />Reading the individual stories of survivors from around the world, I got the sense of humanity's most precious attributes, in the face of inhuman hunger. What is it that makes a man, a woman, a person? What is it about our common humanity that defines how we will meet our end? Zombies and the fascination with our own inevitable deaths gives one room for reflection. Those looking for action or bored by individual stories miss the point. This book is about you, the reader, and how you would react to these same situations. This is the most compelling novel I've ever read, not because it tells the story of a silly zombie fantasy, but because World War Z is expressly about being human, the human story itself.<br /><br />As someone who bought the hardcover World War Z years ago, I have actively followed the news on the movie starring Brad Pitt. I have no comment in that regard save to convey a poignant opening chapter of the book itself, and compare it to Pitt's Summer Spectacular.<br /><br />Max Brooks brilliantly does not explain too much about the zombies. He notes in his dedication that this book is inspired by George Romero, and one can see this book as a clear extension of the premise of the original Night of the Living Dead, spread across a global scale. That's it, and it's what Brooks does with that premise that amazes.<br /><br />At the start of World War Z is a chapter simply titled Patient Zero. We meet the Chinese physician who is called to a remote village to investigate a strange flu outbreak. A young boy and his father had been out fishing for salvage when they were attacked by something in the water. Here Max Brooks shows his command of history by describing how many villages were deliberately flooded to build the great dam.<br /><br />Something pulled the father underwater. The boys climbs aboard the boat, but not before he is bitten by something reaching from the water. It is rumored that something from the submerged town was awakened, perhaps the spirits of the ancestors were angry at this desecration, or perhaps there is a scientific explanation. Again, we don't know if this is science or something mystical, and that is for the best in terms of suspense. The mystery of the zombies remains, despite every story. Pure genius.<br /><br />So the Chinese doctor reaches this remote village, and finds the superstitious villagers have restrained the infected boy, and are treating about a dozen bite victims who are in varying stages of distress. The doctor is stunned to find the boy dead and still straining to attack him through his bonds. The doctor calls a friend from the Long March, and his government friend hints that this is something very dangerous indeed. Helicopters from the People's Liberation Army land, and medics in full biohazard gear take away the victims and affected villagers and try to contain the zombie plague.<br /><br />It's too late, of course, but right here the reader has a good grasp on the human friendships and concerns that typify these accounts. The story reflects well on the Chinese people, their caring physicians, and even their government in its rapid response.<br /><br />From the news reports, Brad Pitt and his Hollywood producers were concerned that mentioning China would affect movie sales, so they cut all references to China as the source of the first infection. That's why I shared the opening chapter. Caveat Emptor, moviegoers.<br /><br />I long to hear the unabridged audiobook sold by Random House for World War Z. Regardless of how the movie performs, I would hope that a future producer would take a cue from Tom Hanks and produce a miniseries for World War Z. Say five 2-hour episodes budgeted at $200 million. That would be the treatment this book deserves, for the story of World War Z is not in how fast zombies move, or flying one man's family around in a helicopter, or in finding a cure (a la Will Smith in his execrable remake I Am Legend). The story of World War is the story of our humanity to one another, and our common bonds, not which separates us. In all that death, that is the message I take from Max Brooks, and I hope he puts similar energy into researching his next masterpiece. Thank you, Max.
B005GIS1WA|3.0|I appreciate an animated series that I can enjoy with my kids.  This movie isn't as good as others....story is a little bland.....but I was still entertained as well as my kids.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Incredible quality, no issues at all streaming. Hubby and I blew through the entire season in 2 days and can't wait for season 4!!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Arnold is still an entertaining actor regardless of the storyline.  This is a fun movie.  If you like action this is the movie for you.
B001NA6096|5.0|I think it is so interesting to listen in on a person conversation and all their deep thoughts.  It is like being a fly on the wall.  You are anonymous and yet very intimate with the characters most private thoughts.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard is my go-to app for reading news. It's got a clean interface and gives me all the relevant articles I want.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|It was very sweet to watch this couple just pick up where they left off 9 years ago.  They shared all their hopes, dreams, anguish, disappointments with each other and then just relished being together again.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander had an amazing medical and life journey, and he writes of his survival in great detail. Phenomenal story!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Two high-powered legal careers pivot around a 3-generation household. Each episode stands lone, with lots of subtle intrigue and fast dialogue, like the West Wing, so you want to pay attention or you'll miss a critical clue. During the whole season, each episode leads the main story line through many surprising twists. The 4 main actors are terrific, but so are the 5 or 6 regular supporting characters, so you really feel for them, or despise a few of them. Very entertaining.
B000VK7KVQ|1.0|I stream movies via other sites often and have never had this problem: during the last 45 minutes of the movie, it would skip ahead several minutes... revealing the plot before I could get up to rewind it. This was happening frequently, maybe every minute or two. After this happened 6 times, I downloaded it on itunes.<br />Zodiac is a fine movie, no problems with it at all. I just won't stream on amazon until there's some sort of guarantee that it will work.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful. And I imagined several different endings, but none compared to what the author chose. A very good read! Looking forward to more of JoJo Moyes work.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I got this for my neice (who's on an 80's kick) to watch.  The story is just as interesting for her as it was when I was a teenager.Very simple moviemaking, but massive impact. The extras stuff was cool.  It's interesting to see the perspectives of the actors not only on their own characters, but the others as well.  I'm a sucker for that stuff anyway.  No Ringwald or Estevez, but the others are all there.  If you're an 80's fan it's a nice watch..
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was slow in places but over all I was captivated by it. I was hanging on till the end and then I was left wanting more.
1781162646|4.0|Ok, so there's a new Stephen King book out called Joyland. Here are some of the key components:<br /><br />- A serial killer who slashes throats at amusement parks.<br />- A ghost.<br />- A little boy with a special ability to just sort of 'know things'.<br />- A whodunnit mystery.<br />- A college kid who loses his sweetheart and grows up.<br /><br />As everyone knows, Stephen King is the master of terror - so you might expect the first three components listed above to be the most important parts of Joyland... but you would be wrong!<br /><br />Joyland is, at its heart, the coming of age tale of 21 year old Devin Jones. Devin is an everyman, a nice guy. He's going through a rough breakup with his first true love. He gets a job at Joyland, a second rate amusement park filled with cool college kids at summer jobs and weirdo carnies that are kind of there for life. There's a fortune teller, some sexy girls who take photos and pressure you into buying them, and plenty other flavorful characters. It's a flavorful and interesting backdrop for a novel.<br /><br />As mentioned above, Devin is dealing with a lot of stuff. He's a young kid in an emotional part of life, and the ghost, serial killer, etc. serve as plot devices for some real growing up. The ghost and serial killer might sound scary, but there aren't really very many scary moments in Joyland. There are a few, I guess, but there are many more touching moments. Moments where you want to reach out to Devin and say, \\"Devin, hang in there dude - we'll get through this together and things will work out great.\\" This isn't a book that will keep you up at night, this is a book that will keep you wondering how Stephen King can put into words so perfectly what it's like to like a girl who likes someone else better than you. If you're looking for a Stephen King tale of terror, then look elsewhere.<br /><br />Joyland is also nominally a mystery, but I didn't get much out of this aspect of the book. Without giving anything away, there's this murder mystery and then it just kind of gets resolved all at once without the typical back and forth, slow progress, clue gathering, false leads, etc. that most mystery novels are filled with.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Stephen King, then Joyland is probably most similar in style to Hearts in Atlantis. Hearts in Atlantis is one of my favorite King books, and Joyland is definitely no Hearts in Atlantis. It just doesn't have the unique story hooks, the characters are a bit flatter, and the lynchpin story connecting the coming-of-age theme isn't quite as interesting. Joyland is still good, but I'd recommend Hearts in Atlantis ahead of it any day. If you've already read Hearts in Atlantis and want another great story, then pick up Joyland - it's good. Good enough that I blasted through it in a day without slowing down.ay, there's this murder mystery and then it just kind of gets resolved all at once without the typical back and forth, slow progress, clue gathering, false leads, etc. that most mystery novels are filled with.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Stephen King, then Joyland is probably most similar in style to Hearts in Atlantis.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I'm really happy I bought this product! I had read good reviews and that's why I also want to leave positive feedback.  My baby simply loved this mobile, loved the music and the movement of the leaves with the animals. It has been my saver many times when putting my baby to sleep.  Highly recommend!
B007ZYJT1U|1.0|but after the dog was killed I was gone. That was sufficient for me to know I didn't care about the main character.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Look... the story of Eva and Gideon..perfect.. I paid my $10 for the book for them... everyone else in the book..who gives a damn about them?!?!?!  There are too my subplots mucking up Gideon and Eva.  Very frustrated over Sylvia Day writing the series like it's the TV show 24..she is writing it as though we have to see the hour by hour events of their lives which equals, more books which equals more money in her pocket.  I read your interview Ms. Day stating you don't want to rush things..but you are doing the exact opposite by writing their story at a snails pace.  Do your fans a favor, make the fourth book the last book, make it only about Gideon and Eva and oh yeah..can we have it in the next 3 months.  You are hearing our frustration and downright disappointment in what has turned into a farce.  Get out while it's hot... now the series is barely lukewarm.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love Michael Buble & his style of music & as a performer. This album is a joy to listen to, if you like Michael you'll like this.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|Dark, gritty story lines.  Great acting and great writing.  Vic Mackey plays the \\"flawed hero\\" to perfection.  The Strike Team is clearly not made up of \\"good guys\\" but the viewer still roots for them.<br /><br />The supporting cast is just as great.  CCH Pounder does an amazing job as the one truly ethical detective in the facility.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Enjoy Rod in his later years of music. If you are a Rod Stewart fan would recommend this album for you.
B005S9ELVC|1.0|This film stunk to high heaven trying to imitate something else.  Bad DVD. Maybe someone else liked it, I hope so.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|This is bound to be one of those cds that pump out hit after hit. Of course you cant go wrong with any of their cd's. Bound to be one of the cd's of the summer,,
B0010SKUYM|4.0|This book is lengthy but it really caught my attention. I went on to read the second book quickly and can't wait for the third book in the series to be published. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who is into fantasy, world building, and character development.
0838577016|5.0|great writing and illustrations. lots of history and well explained phenomena. worth every penny. well done. the author is a prize winner.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed it immensely and finished it in one reading. This is for dreamers who are not satisfied with their own life.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Most people were expecting this disc to be full of dancefloor anthems and as a result they seem to be dissapointed. Daft Punk are perfectionists at heart and were not aiming at owning places like Ibiza. What they really wanted was to make us time travel to an alternative 80's timeline. Once you understand that, you can really appreciate what they've done. This disc is a tribute (Giorgio by Moroder), a time machine (Lose yourself to dance)  and conceptual art piece (Contact).
B004OR199G|5.0|The information contained in this book will get you well on your way to feeling great.  Kriss Carr's writing style is witty and very encouraging.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I was thinking of Lauren Bacall and Genie gave me Carole Lombard.  LOL. But all in all a fun app.  Worth the FREE price tag most definitely.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun to play and its a cool way to take care of your own horse(s) without having a horse. Play its free.<br /><br />NOTE: The review above is by our daughter (I want her to get credit for \\"publishing\\" her review here) - it's my Amazon account but the Kindle is hers, and she wanted and plays the game.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|very nice movie. I was enjoy and laugh. But is incredible how parents don't pay attention to this type or children.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Like all the other readers of this \\"trilogy\\" I was soooo looking forward to this book for such a long time. The story started out fine, hot, steamy, just what I expected, absolutely yummy. Then half way the story started going in all kinds of directions and the 2 main characters became confusing,and silly. Did Ms. Day remember what they were like from the first 2 books or was it such a long time in between books that she forgot about the characters...BUT the topper was the ending....what... oh... no... there was no ending... just another stupid little note saying there's another book.<br />Now I read that this was changed form a trilogy to a 5 book series. Then this book should have been released a lot sooner. WRITERS and AMAZON beware, it's not cool and readers like myself are getting tired of spending so much money to have such a long lapse between these series.<br />I loved this series until now. NOT sure if i will wait to buy the next one.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|Great CD. Most of his music I like. His song are the massages are the Best!!!!!!<br />me encanta es de mi Pais!!!!!!!!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Fun to play, nice graphics, lots to do even without spending money on in-game purchases. Would be nice if the aura stuff was cheaper to purchase but still fun game
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I don't know if the app is really improving the performance and functionality of my Kindle, but watching the graphics zip around and whir...sure makes me feel like it doing &#34;something&#34; good for my world.
B000I8HIV8|5.0|I really liked the movie. I Had watched it a while ago, but thoroughly enjoyed it again. I will recommend it if you have not already watched it.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I ordered both of the CD's.  Even my grandkid's love hearing the music, especially the ones that sound like a marching band
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|really good game when it doesn't crash, when it does crash it crashes repeatedly and doesn't want to open, when it works its fun and very additive
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Must READ this book will not disapoint. I even heard a movie is coming based on this series. Can't wait.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It really works don't believe me then try it. It guessed 5 characters in a row and they were all right
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this App, this is a great game to have when you have to wait in a doctors pffice
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ok I realllly tried to like this book. But in the end I couldn't finish this junk. I really want my 10 dollars back and the few hours of existence that I wasted reading this. How the heck did this make the Ny times best seller list? I have a better time reading Elmo to my 3 yr old, the plot is more interesting. I thought I was messed up, but the fact that so many women think the sex scenes in this book were hot tells me that I'm actually ok! Ana is a real gem. She's got good looking, normal men around her yet she's nuts about this creepo Christian. Too bad this was on my kindle cause I had big plans for it when my household runs out of toilet paper.
0143118420|3.0|I picked this up since everyone had read it and spoke it's praises. I was let down and found it hard to even finish the book.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Are you serious with this book?  I can't believe I waited so long for it and it was such a huge disappointment.
B00486070K|4.0|internet is working good with this product. It gets little warm when it's in use but no worries. I'm satisfied with this product.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|works a charm.<br /><br />can download youtube vids easy peasy.<br /><br />need 11 more words.. one two three four five six seven.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Really fun and educational for kid's. I have a thirty year old daughter that loves this game day in and day out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|awesome read.  u must try.  It gives insights into relationships.  I couldnt put it down or wait for mu next buy.  I am looking forward to more books about Christian and Anastasia.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Very Goog I watched every episode and look forward to more in the future, holds you and makes you anticipate the next moves, Piret
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I started reading this not sure what to expect, but loved it! I was so caught up in what was going on, and wanting to know what happened (and being shocked once I found out)! I think this is a book I can read again and again! I'm hoping the rest of the series is just as good (if not better)! I'm loving James Dashner's work so far!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love all three books!  Movies needs to come out soon!  I'm on my third time of reading them!!!  Awesome books!
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Jack Bauer: He's tough, enduring, phyiscally strong, but he balances it all out with uncomprimising love for the people he trusts and his country. Jack's the man, there's nothing more to say.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Makes you want to read the other two books.  Total page turner!  Other two books are just as great!  Love them!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was an interesting book, with interesting characters that really held my interest.  So much so that I got another book from the same author, (can't remember the name now) which wasn't as good though.  I had to go get the DVD to watch it and of course, as is usually the case, the movie is never as good as the book.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|The controls took me a few minutes to get used to,  but once you get them down you can level up really quickly.  Which is nice because I don't like games that require you to pay actual money in order to advance.  Overall it's definitely one of my favorite games for my kindle fire.
B00BTLOOAQ|3.0|Ms. Salvant has a fine voice, fine phrasing. But I thought she had an excess of &#34;style''--now it's Billy Holiday, now Sarah Vaughan, now Dinah Washington, and so on. I think some of the songs would be much more powerful if she kind of played it straight. She's  a fine musician, so, perhaps as she gains experience, she will really do great things.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is awesomeness and my dad is awesome and enchilada and support for treatment of cartoon character and Charles Barkley to get a long trip to get fun
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so disappointed with mrs. Day. The story dragged on and really had no plot. I would not have wasted so much money if I knew she was going to drag this out in five books! I am done with reading any more books by her!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is a great one. I hope that every one thinks the same thing about this game.:-)<br /><br />  -Serena
0425263924|5.0|I loved Entwined with You.  After the tumultuous turns in book 2, I was glad to spend some happy time with Eva and Gideon.  I was nice to see how they are developing as individuals and as a couple.  I disagree with the negative reviews, the plot twists and turns felt completely organic to me. I'm excited to read book four.  Kudos to you sylvia day!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It was a great game and would have been 5 stars but with the update I believe they just did today you can't even open the game to play it
0385349831|2.0|Although this is categorized as a novel this at first glance reads as a journal.  More than tell me a story, it tends to make inspirational speeches throughout.  Not what I was expecting.
0810989956|1.0|I was not happy with the quality of this purchase. It stated it was in good condition which was incorrect! The book came dirty, some form of brown residue on the front and back cover as well on some of the pages of the book. The entire book had been written in. My daughter was very upset and i ended up having to go buy the same book brand new. This sale actually cost me more instead of saving. I am VERY displeased with this purchase!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Absolutely loved the entire CD.  I listen to it every day.  Rod Stewart has always been one of the greatest singers.
B008YU0AOE|2.0|I had this app durring math class and it took FOREVER because their is every other key on the face of this earth besides CLEAR. You have to do a swipe for every number you use. This is SO frustrating.it has adds, only one calculator design, and it is time consuming. Don't waste your devices memory. :(
B008XG1X18|3.0|App is slow. I can never create a pin because it says the app had an unexpected error. Really wish this worked better.
B003QSJVV2|5.0|I love this movie in spite of the poor acting of Nic Cage. The action is great and the cast is very good. Ignore the overracting and watch this movie tonight!
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|While reading this wonderful book, I noticed so many small things that rang true. They lead the reader to trust the story, to see it as a slice of real life. Part of that life is humor and the author's eye and ear are sharp as any other's. Rarely does a book make me tear up and laugh aloud. Thanks to the widow who recommended it to me!
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|Growing up in the thirties with too many pages spent on adolescent youths sexual fantasies.  I found myself skipping pages as they were redundant.  Have no idea why this book was published.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I read the book before watching this, thinking it would be almost the same. WRONG. The movie doesnt follow the book plot line at all, and changes lots of characteristics of the book as well. To sum it up, i thought this was one of the best books ive ever read but the movie was thoroughly disappointing.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very good novel that will keep you guessing as to the outcome with an ending that will surprise.  A real page turner.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Hill Climb will be a fun time for the player. It held my attention and was great to be entertained.
B00005B4GT|5.0|It's kind of a sleeper album that gets lost between the others but I love it. This LP is a must for any fan.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Great movie just as good as the book was and worth having in your library for those rainy days you cant go out doors. Or just those i want a good movie to watch tonight.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined with You is the 3rd in the Crossfire series. This book (and the previous 2) is told from Ava's point of view and it sometimes gets frustrating to only see and feel what she sees and feels. However, the author does a great job of alerting the reader to Gideon's views through conversations or Ava's reflecting thoughts after the events have taken place. It picks up with Ava going back to her apartment after meeting Gideon at his, when she learns the truth about what happened to her step-brother. I was disappointed that we didn't get to see the conversation that took place. This book is mostly about Gideon and Ava rebuilding their relationship after time apart. They have to do this carefully to keep detectives from linking Gideon to the murder of Ava's step-brother who abused her. We learn more about Gideon and his weaknesses and vulnerabilities in this book. It was also nice to see the two of them accept and even embrace that due to both being abuse survivor's their relationship is unique and different, but as long as it works for them, it works. Ultimately there are a lot of questions that I felt were answered, but enough loose ends to lead into the next 2 books in the series. There wasn't what I would really consider a cliffhanger (THANK GOODNESS!) and I feel Gideon and Ava were left in a good, happy for now kind of place. Can't wait for the next one!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Yes, the story is based in Yemen and with some great description of perhaps how life is like there.<br />That aside, the book kept me guessing at how the plot might evolve. A few times I was right, but many times I found the outcomes vastly different to that I had guessed.<br />A great read. There were several references to the previous book &#34;Lions Game&#34; but you really do not need to read that first. But that book too is a great read.
B00C33M2EE|4.0|This isn't really my style, but my wife loves it.  I'd give the CD (and videos) a 5/5, but I've dinked it by a star because Amazon claims the album is available for AutoRip, but it isn't.  I've had the CD since the day it was issued, but it still doesn't show up for AutoRip (even though Amazon still claims it to be on the AutoRip list).
B001C34HUS|5.0|The process for generating big ideas is simple and very practical. If you're looking for a solution to brainstorm ideas on the fly within a group, this book is not for you. But if you're someone who wants that BIG idea then this process is sure to get you there! This advice was well worth the money spent.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|By far the most violent and grotesque network TV show I have ever seen --- but it works at every level.  Just hope they can sustain this for another season.
0425263924|5.0|This amazing story between Gideon & Eva so happy that there will be more of them to share with us readers .Loved Entwined with you much as the first two books... if not more!Not even a single line or paragraph left unread because it wasn't interesting.Just hoping not to wait that much for the next one :-)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It has some language and sexual situations, but the fact that they point out that some of their behavior is wrong is refreshing.  The story line is interesting and keeps your interest which, in my opinion, is rare these days.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|As usual, Harry and his complex human personality keeps you deeply involved with the storyline.<br />But, this time, there is a hole unexplained that is unforgivable... Except if it is a link for some new novel...<br />In short, read it. You'll liki it
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series is quite good.  It does have some language, but not unbearable.  It also has some sexual situations, but overall does not take away from the story line and series.  Well done as far as entertainment goes and is refreshing as we have a difficult time finding something worth watching these days.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I was pretty blown away with this. Surely computers are smart these days but I'm compelled to write a review because I thought of Fred Allen and he was picked with apparent ease from questions and answers that I didn't see how it happened. Several others worked that way also. Others are easy like getting asked for Ringo, is he British, member of the Beatles, does he play drums. I didn't try Pete Best Hmmmmmm. This is a lot of fun. The only times it's been wrong so far for me I'm pretty sure I answered a question wrong. I'm not worried about the permissions that are brought up with concern in other reviews because I trust amazon. I agree with one reviewer they must need this to enrich the app and there is no fowl play. Hint hint amazon :)  This app is a lot of fun and I'm determined to defeat Akinator fair and square at least once.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator. Works perfectly. Highly recommended. Great for on the go calculations. Visually very nice. Good for figuring out grades.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Lots of great hits on this CD. I enjoy listening to it at work or at home. Highly recommend this CD
B009CF3MEK|4.0|Having recently watched the 2000 remake of this movie, I was pleased with the quality of the film and of couse, the fine cast - how attractive they all were in 1974!  It will continue to be a favorite.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Lots of great hits on this CD; brings back some very good memories of my younger days. Highly recommend this CD
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Although the book started off a little slow, it eventually caught my full attention and interest. It was smart, witty, and a true testament to survival.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so life like i love this game I highly recomend it my kids even understand how to play it
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Some things were resolved, others were brought up and left unresolved.  The story was going great took a few different twists and then ended, just like that.  Very abrupt and then we find out at the very end that isn't the trilogy that it was said to be, there will be more in the series so that she can finish up writing about this couple which could have been finished up in this book.  If the author wanted to continue to ride the cash cow that she is on for this series, she could have done a spin off on some of the other characters. I will NOT be reading anymore in this series and seriously contemplate any more by this author.  I wasted $10 on that darn book and I want to know who I get my money back from!!!
B0084B5TK8|4.0|It was an exciting book, I was able to read only for a few minutes here and there. I found it easy to remember all of what happened and felt so excited to read what would happen next.<br />I didn't expect a book like this with the title of Dracula, however I was pleasantly surprised to read an actual book about Dracula than be shocked and horrified by something terrible and unfit for human consumption.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|My five year old wanted to down load it. He figured out how to play it right away, he loves it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this book. Wool is a first-rate suspense thriller and an epic dystopian science fiction tale, but what makes it great is that at its core it's a novel about people you'll come to care about.<br /><br />Like most novels set after an unspecified apocalypse, the natural question we as readers often have is: What caused it? Too often, this is left unaddressed, or the answer isn't that compelling. That's not the case here. By the end of Wool, you'll know all the details that matter about what happened and why. And they don't disappoint.<br /><br />If you're even a little on the fence about buying this book, give [[ASIN:B005FC52L0 Wool - Part One]] (free) a try on your Kindle. It's short and you can read it in an hour or two, but I guarantee you won't be able to stop there. You'll want to enter the world of Wool ... and you'll be very glad you did.
030759565X|5.0|I started paging through this at a friend's house and immediately ordered a copy for myself. So far, everything we've made is wonderful -- including one of our new favorite go-to casual dinners: broccoli rabe panini. Each time we try a new recipe, we're pleased! As Ina Garten devotees, it feels like we're cheating on her, but only a little bit... Definitely worth owning this one!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game very fun and gives you some responsibility and it is like having your own horse if you don't have one
B001IF252C|1.0|This adapter displays horrible snow every time my computer wakes from sleep. I have to keep the adapter close, so I can unplug it and plug it back in every time I wake up my computer. Ouch.<br /><br />Believe the bad reviews. I wish I had.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Good for kids to learn anyone it the ocean and how the animals live under the sea. My four year old lives this game and could understand the goals that where asked of him.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The actors were terrific;  however, the movie was mostly about the effort to get the 13th Amendment passed.  My thoughts are why the movie wasn't named &#34;The Thirteenth Amendment&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game and my favorite part about it is that you get different places in the world like Miami, Sydney , Tokyo and many more !! This app is very nice harder that Temple Run and better for my opinion one problem I  that the updates are a little late :/ but other than that I LOVE this app and play it everyday!!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I am only upset that I didn't find out about Emeli sooner.<br />It's not very often that I find a female singer whose work I appreciate and respect.<br />Emeli Sande is an unstoppable force.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|im a long time fan of scribblenauts and when i found out that it was for kindle fire i flipped out i suggest it
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Good for anyone looking for a twist on a teenage romance as it is told from the differing perspective of both Eleanor and Park and comments on the parts of life and family that impact young adults in very big ways
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|It's a good dictionary. It works like it is supposed to. enough said.<br />Great for &#34;cheating&#34; in on line word games.
B007TKT2SK|3.0|It works great as long as you need the fraction feature but I find that the added feature merely confuses the keyboard when I want a basic calculator which is 99.9% of the time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The obviously sexual language and vivid imagery overwhelm the actual story, but it is overall an enjoyable read. Give it a try.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you only want a basic calculator, this fits the bill nicely and for the lack of price, it is the way to go.
B0058PJ6NE|2.0|the free version is very cheap. lol it doesnt cost anything but i dont see a differance between this one and the free one.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm 43 and I have a son who is 5.  He's slowly discovering Star Wars via Legos and these movies.  Although I'm well aware of the changes made in the original versions, who cares, right?  For a new generation of kids, none of that crap matters.  I'm sure at some point he MIGHT notice that the graphics go down hill between Episodes 3 and 4.  haha.  Oh well.  I loved watching all of the movies again (and again).  I haven't gotten into the extra material yet.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This product works flawlessly with Streets and Trips.  I wouldn't be without it.  We have a Garmin GPS and STILL use this simultaneously to track out progress on the Computer Map.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|When I rate kids movies, I take notice on what my kids are doing while they're watching it.  My kids smile.  They laugh.  And they're engrossed in the movie.  I'm not sure much else matters.  I'm not the type to over analyze stuff like this...
B007C52NY2|5.0|The world lost a great writer way too soon. You wll not be able to get his characters out of your mind...ever
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|I have to say that this season stressed me the hell out!  That's a good thing...and it means the writers are doing a great job with suspense and story lines.  Can't wait for the next (final) season to start!  WOOT!
B000HEVALC|5.0|This is just plain fun to hear these icons in an unrehearsed setting.  You understand that they were all about the music.  The money and fame were gravy.
B009YMNVMO|5.0|I always reiterate that I'm reviewing this product in a way for parents to understand, in relation to their kids.  My kids loved it.  They laughed, they sang and watched it over and over.  I have no idea what it's going to do to YOUR kids psychologically, and I don't really care.  My kids are normal and understand that it's a movie.  :)
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|I've been a long time fan of The J.R.R. Tolkien, TLOTR, and The Hobbit. Not role playing, conventions, or any of that tripe. I've appreciated his writing style, story lines, characters, and the remarkable creation of an alternate world with its own languages. I know the books well and even sent Tolkien a letter to tell him how much I'd appreciated his work. That was back in the 60s when I was in high school. He even responded in 1965 with a personal, signed note on his stationary that I still have framed and on the wall. All that by way of establishing that I have some appreciation for the original. The 3 movies that covered The Lord of the Rings trilogy were good, entertaining films that showed some respect for the books. The Hobbit is hardly recognizable - other than the presence of hobbits as characters on the screen. It's longer than it ever needed to be, borrows lavishly from bits and pieces from Tolkien's The Silmarillion (kind of a grab bag of Middle Earth prehistory and undeveloped story lines - all clumped into a near unreadable tome). If you're completely unfamiliar with The Hobbit, you might find some special effects entertaining. Otherwise, you'll likely be very disappointed. And to think that this director is going to milk the modestly sized Hobbit (shorter than one of the three volumes in TLOTR) into 3 movies would be laughable if it weren't also sad. I watched this on my Kindle Fire during a 6 hr. flight to the West Coast - and even that boring environment was not enough to keep me interested in the film. The Fire, on the other hand, delivered lots of other content to keep me entertained for most of the trip - so it wasn't the delivery mechanism, it was the wretched execution of The Hobbit in video. At most, just rent the film. Even cheaper, watch the trailer about 50 times in a row for free and for equivalent value.
1574216988|5.0|This is probably my favorite Zentangle book of the 6 I purchased in the last 4 months. I like the pretty designs. I am enjoying keeping a Zentangle journal and getting in touch with my right brain.  :o) It is fun! Even when I made a Zentangle card and the recipient said &#34;what is it?&#34; I was not discouraged. (She just did not have an appreciation for my newly found creative expression :o)  Easy, portable, creative hobby! Have Zentangled in the rain and sun while camping, waiting for a funeral to begin, sitting in car waiting for daughter during dance lessons and piano lessons...just grab my little plastic box (ArtBin Magnetic Storage Case works for me...approx 7&#34; x 9&#34;...got it on sale for $10 at JoAnn's Crafts) filled with supplies and take it everywhere for those times there are a few minutes to relax. My 9 year old daughter loves it too! I made her a box for Valentines Day filled with supplies and even created a picture to go on the front of her box so we can distinguish hers and mine.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|I really liked what Giacchino did with the first movie.  One of my favorite pieces from that soundtrack was the popular &#34;Labor of Love&#34; music where Kirk's father rams the bad guys with his ship.  The new score has some great moments in it too.  The best one to me is &#34;Sub Prime Directive&#34;.  The music builds and really captures the intense scene in the movie that it is pulled from.  Giacchino has done something else with these movies that some music composers fail to do sometimes...and that is to give it a great theme that becomes recognizable in different variations that compliments key scenes in the movie.  James Horner and Jerry Goldsmith did it with the other Star Trek movies and I am glad that Giacchino has done the same.  It is a great movie and this score is done really well.  If you are a fan and collector of film music, you've got to have this one in your collection.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not well-written but the story is a sweet one. I would recommend as beach reading this summer, but don't look for extreme depth tHat won't be there.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series of books! This book exceeded my expectations! There were so many twists and turns. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Don't like because none of the subjects interest me and its not what I thought it would be so there..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|His was more challenging than i expected, which made it a great escape game. The graphics were nice as well. I will definitely be on the lookout for more games from company.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I liked the yahoo because I can check my email.Its easy to check and reply to it. I would recommend to everyone because they don't have to go home and look at there email. Anywhere they are they can check it  It is very conveinct to be able to email someone where ever you might be. I would not come compare it to know other.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was highly disappointed with this book.  There was just too much continuous drama, the intimate scenes rarely varied.  I was expecting this book to be the final of this series, but it just seems to go on and on.  I won't buy the next book.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I dislike that I have to repeat, repeat, repeat and just because I miss one creature. I don't like that. Over all its a pretty nice game and it keeps you going.
0812550706|5.0|\\"I liked it because he was almost my age. I also liked that it was science fiction. I also liked it because part of it I didn't really understand.\\"
B005HSL626|3.0|This a very intertaining game and also addicted. I would recommend to younger people if they want to pass the time smashin fruit. I like it to,.My grandchildren just love it and there or 5 and 3.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|i like it, i have read all the books and i find just like the first movie i can read them over and over again
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Really revealing to what the members think and how they came together.. Great archived footage of all members and their lead up to becoming the Eagles.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I thought it would be better. I like it but the is not what I expected, I didn't like the playlists that they have I want to be able to change songs whenever I want to.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|again, a publisher and author are taking advantage of the \\"serial\\" game. For myself, the only way I can fight back is that I am starting no NEW serials. If all readers did the same, think of the power we would have!<br />We have a story about two unimaginably \\"damaged\\" individuals trying to make their love work. To some, the story may seem thin. I think, it is as real a love story as I have ever read. My God, look at what this two have been thru: his determined ex-fiancée who is willing to pay any cost to bind Gideon to her no matter how much guilt she has to pile on him, her husband who places all the fault at Gideon's feet rather then look at himself, a reporter with her own grudge against Gideon willing to dig up any dirt on him, Gideon's mother who still refuses to accept the truth and blames Eva for trying to make trouble, his step-brother that has let jealousy take over  every breathing moment and Gideon is still trying to run a business (OK, empire)and manage a healthy relationship with Eva.<br />Eva, who is still one of the strongest female characters I have read, shows a maturity far beyond her 24 years. On top of her relationship with Gideon and all of his baggage, she has to manage: a job, an emotionally damaged and obsessed Mother who cheats on her own husband, a father who finds out the awful truth about Eva's past 14 years too late and his guilt over that, Cary, who is also damaged and still carrying around a lot of his emotional baggage who is involved with Trey, and Eva's ex, Brian, the sexy rock-star who wants her back, badly.<br />On top of that we have police, pregnancies, suicide attempts, fights and enough emotion to fill up Lake Michigan!!!!<br /> When two people fall in love do we expect pipe music and then they ride off into the sunset!? Is that quick enough for you?<br />When two people fall in love their problems are just beginning. Even for \\"normal\\" couples they both have a lot to learn about each other AND all of the people involved in both of their lives. If it were all sugar and spice we would not have the climbing divorce rate that is currently the biggest threat to this country, that is what I believe. Life has become so complicated and the road to love and a successfull, committed relationship is an emotional minefield.<br />However, I HATE the way she cut off the story . This was not a cliffhanger ending, it was a poof! I also hate the way we have been jerked round on release dates and the COST. With two more books that comes to $50 for ONE series. I don't know about you but I don't have that kind of money to throw around on ONE series. Even the great George R.R. Martin, Stephen King and Dean Koontz are not THAT expensive, and they re a lot better writers,!!!! After reading the author's FB page and attempting to contact her, I was ignored while those gushing all over her were not!  I REFUSE to be jerked around  by this author and her greedy mitts and SHE obviously does not care about her \\"Dear Readers\\". So, I am going to exercise the only power I HAVE and return the book for a refund. I am Done With You Ms. Day and Done With Your Books. I am going to imagine my own ending with Eva and Gideon and will be better then your trash.
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|Great graphics. Great game play. Great concept. All around fun time killer. I play it quite often and recommend it for all ages.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The night circus was entertaining from beginning to end. The book leaves you with the feeling as if you were actually there.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|great story and awesome casting and great photography<br />Got rather addicting, much to my surprise.  definitely worth watching<br />I felt like I really knew these people
B00969PR18|2.0|Slow loading- difficulty finding server. Was really kist looking for a google maps type app. Will look at others, such as mapquest, etc. this one is lackluster.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this calculator.  It shows your your running total.  For a free calculator it is a pretty good one.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Very cool CD and DVD. Those guys are amazing and their songs are very well played. Some videos are super funny and they play in the middle of nature with some incredible places.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The initial free app includes a generous number of boards to solve. After that, you have to buy more boards. I found the game to be  fun. Particularly, it's useful to exercising the other side of your brain while still listening, e.g. in a boring meeting.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Streamed the movie from my Blue Ray player using the Amazon App and it was great and the movie was fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the most awesome games ever!!! I appuloutly love it!!!!!! It is the best game ever!! We love it
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This is a British soap opera, which is a good thing. I love soap operas, especially family stories. The only problem I had was trying to listen on my Kindle Fire. Even with the sound turned up all the way, I can't always understand the British dialect.
B000002VMD|5.0|I love Whitney Houston and her rendition of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You was so moving, it made me cry.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I haven't been able to play this game. Maybe I need practice! I even went to the Internet and downloaded directions, but so far to no avail.
B00466HNHM|5.0|I loved Kevin Costner in this movie. It was exciting and had many twists to it. Whitney did a great job as the in danger singer.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game.  I am currently stuck on one of the games and it is driving my crazy.  Want to complete it but it has me stumped.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|My son and I are big Star Trek fans no matter if it's the original series, Deep Space Nine or any of the other Star Trek spin-offs made for television.  We have also seen all the Star Trek movies even the latest, Star Trek Into Darkness..
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|This movie was very slow moving and sometimes not very historically accurate. I have to admit I fell asleep before the end but I chose not to go back and watch it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|The series is great in my opinion.  I love the whole scenario of being invaded, having to survive on what would really happen through scavaging, foraging, trading, and all that.  The ability of the people to fight for their lives and their freedoms at the cost of the brave to protect the majority.  It really is a good series with lots of action, lots of drama and a real sense of character development.
B007N6EUHI|5.0|As a physical therapist and chiropractor I find the program great to have on my Android tablet for my reference and to show patients what I am working on.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|The second season continued right after the first and continued to build upon the characters. You will still love'm or hate'm but the show is growing in a positive manner and getting better.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|it was worth the money. I would recommend it to anyone that likes seek and finds. you do also have the puzzles to do.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Nothing fancy in terms of options. Since it is ORM controller, it did what it is expected to do. Price was right on Amazon.
B003XDZN8A|4.0|I loved my existing classic crocs, but I wanted something more feminine. These felt a little tight at first but stretched right away and are now molded to my feet.  I have bunions so I need a comfortable shoe and these are great. The black goes with everything and doesn't look too bad even with dresses. I'm giving 4 stars because the first few times I wore them, they really irritated the sides of my feet and caused blisters. But, I had expected this because I read other reviews here saying the same thing. A patch of moleskin covering the inside of the buttons should be fine. But, honestly, after wearing them 4-5 times, they stopped irritating. I don't know if my feet just got tougher or something in the shoe wore down but now they're perfectly comfortable!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game,very fun. The graphics are nice and the puzzles are well done. I just wish it were longer.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|When i first signed up 2 years ago...it was consistant...performed on the go and worked amazing. Ever sine the updates it is choppy,freezes, and just isnt worth the monthy charge for the cloud. I have stuck woth it in hopes to see smoother running, but it seems amazon has allowed their competitors to surpass them and put out better players.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|This app seems to know everything about characters, it guessed several of mine without much effort. The only thing that is missing is more topics!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I love the show,  It shows how the house help can pretty well run the family and the household.  They seem to keep the family on an even keel even though they have many problems of their own..Great Show<br />Mama
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I loved their last CD and found that I played it more often than other newly acquired music so my expectations were high for their new album and I was not disappointed.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Storyline is good, very sad and a reminder of such a tragic event. There is hope in the midst knowing they will reunite. However, the reuniting is the goal of the whole plot. Good cinematography. Moving movie. Wouldn't re-watch just a one timer type of movie. Totally recommend.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I cant get a new update till a month after every one else In my family does.  FIX IT NOW CAUSE IM MAD!!!!!
B00AO3K05S|5.0|It's been ages that I have touched a book on sales. Spending over a decade in selling, I thought I knew all. However, this book transformed all that.<br /><br />I love the research and the examples Dan uses to make his point. It  simply enhances conviction.<br /><br />Spending over 15 years in selling, I recommend this for everyone into direct & indirect selling. It has transformed traditional sales forever.<br /><br />Heartfelt thanks to Dan!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent book about two very confused adults battling mental illness and real-life. The book is very different than the movie but both are excellent in their own ways.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I first I was very skeptical because of all of the &#34;its just about sex&#34; comments.  Excellent back story and after two sex scenes I skimmed over the rest just so I could get back to the story line.  Definitely get the whole trilogy.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I did not think I would like this but my wife had heard some good reviews from her friends and relatives. We found it on Amazon Prime and watched the seasons in a matter of a few days. We had to have the 3rd season and within a few more days I purchased and downloaded from Amazon. The series takes you back to a time of priviliged families who had servants take care of their every need from bathing  to dressing and cooking. I found it hard to believe that these wealthy families were so helpless and more confounding that people were eager to work 14+ hours per day to serve these families. The acting is wonderful along with elegance and manners not seen in a hundred years. Hoping that season 4 is not far away.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome back story...quite a few sex scenes, some steamy, some I just skimmed over just to get back to the storyline.  I am looking forward to the next book to come out that is written from Grey's perspective.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Yes, I bought this book because of the price.  The brief description sounded worth exploring but once I started I almost decided not to read it.  The first few pages were of little interest and I projected that it was going to be something I didn't want to read about - a suicide.  But since I had paid for it, I persisted and by the fifth page or so, I was hooked.  The book was everything I want in a good read and more.  I love projecting what's coming next (solving the whodunit) and am usually good at it but not with Wool.  Except for the last few pages (I won't tell you what happens) I was pleasantly surprised page after page.  I have too many things to do to read a book that I can't put down or have to stay awake at night to finish and Wool solved that problem by combining the characters into their own separate stories.  Which, thank you Mr. Howey, was done masterfully.  Each segment is highly entertaining but the real bonus is at the end when you can reflect back and contemplate the story as a whole. I read strictly for my own enjoyment and will read anything. I don't even insist that they be technically correct - just close enough to be believable and this tale certainly is.  Lately my choices have been a lot of \\"romantic comedy\\" because they're quick and entertaining.  Their loss - I will be reading Hugh Howey for the rest of the summer (just bought The Shift Omnibus).
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this often middle of the night to check radar when stormy - right from bed! Very handy and accurate.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|If you like the writings of Alcott then what's not to love about this collection of 39 works for a great price?  I am only in Little Women presently but look forward to reading the other books which I have never read.  I have read Little Women two to three times in my lifetime but with each reading brings new ideas and good memories from past readings and childhood.  The best part is having 39 books on my Kindle fire and not the weight of them on my bookshelf!
B00C391Y3I|5.0|I saw Judas Priest in 2006 In Hershey, PA and I was just 16 at the time. Queensryche (before they multiplied) and Judas Priest put on the best concert possible and this shows just how amazing they are now. The camera work, sound, puro, voice, drums, and everything sound and look incredible. The Blu Ray has no special features besides the standard tracklist to choose songs to see. It is still worth the price. Also, I got the Blu Ray along with three cds I ordered like two days before the estimated delivery date.
B00005ASOC|5.0|In a wonderful and inspired story, Sean Connery show all his qualities as one off the best actors of our time.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This  was a good book for food for thought and to help make women more aware of how they can achieve more success.
B000T433CO|5.0|I have never seen a Jack Black movie but I fell in lovewih him in this movie.  His character was wonderful.  The rest of the cast were great.  I watch this movie at once a week.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Come on it's Fun. you know it's good it freaking won album of the year what more do i need to say.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, despite its slow start and use of late 1800s English vocab words, which forced me to go to great lengths to look up these words when context clues failed me.  The book revolved around the accounts and lives of 6 individuals, all of whom seem to be initially unrelated except for the same \\"comet\\" birthmarks which they all possess.<br /><br />  Out of the 6 characters, I savored the accounts of Sonmi-451 and Timothy Cavendish.  Without delving too much into the story, Sonmi-451 is a server fabricant, which is a genetically modified clone assigned to society's menial tasks.  The setting takes place is Neo So Corpos, Korea, a totalitarian, dystopian society with consumerism as its main ideal and where a person's value and prestige is equated to how much wealth he or she possesses.  What I found fascinating was of Sonmi's \\"ascension\\" and her views and insights she gleaned from looking at Neo so Corpos from an outsider's perspective.<br /><br />  On the other hand, Tim Cavendish's story is a light and humorous account of a seedy book publisher who becomes flush with cash, gets blackmailed by his client's brothers, and then ends up becoming trapped in a retirement home.  All in all, I found both of these 2 stories to bring 2 different stories and genres which provided quite a refreshing read and kept the book quite entertaining.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Math was never my strong suit. So when our son started bringing homework with fractions this past school year, I was working as hard as he was to get through his assignments. It's easy to use and will definitely speed the process of checking your kids work. You'll appreciate this any time you have to work with fractions.
1878424319|5.0|I would definitely recommend this self motivation book.<br />I love books that are inspirational and self motivation.<br />I also recommend all of Don Miguel Ruiz books.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Louisa May Alcott's semi-autobiographical classic about the March Family was one of the first books given to me as a childhood gift.  However, I didn't read it until I was an adult.  I enjoyed it even though I had already viewed two film versions of the book; I prefer to read books first before seeing the films.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These look great on the wall, are easy to apply, and can easily be peeled off and re-applied without damage to the paint on the wall
B007N85POS|4.0|This one was fun and I enjoyed it.  It had a lot of challenges<br />and was easy to use.  I would recommend
B007BVOEPI|5.0|You have to pay attention carefully but it is an amazing show!!! Visually stunning and sucks the viewer into their world quickly.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|It's not as much fun as the other angry bird games, I guess<br />because I can't figure out how to best use the birds I'm given<br />and I don't see the &#34;?&#34; mark that you see on the others to<br />go back and see how they are used.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Love this movie so much. Not a fan of past Star Trek movies or show but this was a awesome ride. Seeing these characters as young guys was so entertaining!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|It picks up where the first book left off and the story line is very fluid into the second book.  The characters are explored more indepth, allowing you to see characters that weren't concentrated on much in the first book.  My favorite character so far is Tyrion Lannister, the imp.  He's not afraid to ruffle feathers and he goes about it with wit and humor.  Bravo!
0670022411|5.0|The book is pretty good made me feel l a little like I was watching a very slow moving car but after a while it picked up and i Liked it now I need the next book
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I learned  it's not that easy in mitle school . In all of your books I learned that it's not that fun going thorough that.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Ok, so I am going o be totally honest here, I loved the first two books, I became an obsessive reader of all Sylvia Day books. But I gotta e honest, this book sucked.i feel that she spent half the book rehashing about the first two books, and the way she ended book three?!?! Seriously? Why keep it going to five books. It's time to move on. Not sure if I am going to invest any further with these books. Sad, sad day:-(
0989254607|4.0|I don't like spiders.  There, I got that off of my chest.  However, Goss does an impeccable job of creating a dynamic of fear, horror and suspense.  Sara Jones just wants to get on with her life, without the extra baggage of her ex's crime family tagging along.<br /><br />Things are going well until she receives a package with a spider inside.  Are they trying to kill her? How did they find her so quickly and why won't they leave her alone to live her life in peace? Those thoughts are in Sara's mind but she must be immune because she lives to see another day.  But, those around her aren't and as the bodies begin to drop, so does Sara's newfound freedom.<br /><br />With a love interest, page-turning suspense and a crop of clamorous characters, The Tegen Cave is an engrossing and captivating read, even if I did jump at every movement around me, a fearing a spider!
B005DOL0R0|3.0|Very plain looking, would have liked it in leather rather than the material being used for the one I bought
B005GCCJME|5.0|I just received my oyster blue/white duet sport clogs yesterday.  The fit/feel right out of the bag is perfect!  I have wide, flat feet, and prefer New Balance 11 6E's.  However the Womens 12/Mens 10 duet sport clog fits like a glove!  I'll update if anything goes awry, but with \\"unique\\" feet, I can usually tell how well a shoe works at first fit!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just when you think you know what's coming next. SURPRISE!<br />Time to read book three.  I have faith that it also will be a page turner.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This is my first review at Amazon.  I am not stupid (I know, I know, I bought the three Crossfire books) and I have been aware for some time of being manipulated and exploited by the publishing industry. No more.  As of now I will not buy any book until the entire series is out and I can evaluate it as a whole by the reviews of all the books. And I certainly won't be buying any more books by Ms. Day, part of a series or not.  Five books in this \\"trilogy\\".  Really? Will even that be enough to wring a conclusion out of the author? I'm not even going to read this.  I'm sending it back I'm so done.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely. love this. game. we play it every night! my daughter also plays it with her jana. from ga
0425263924|5.0|I love that the series isn't over. I enjoyed the book. So many things I can say but I don't want to give spoilers for those who don't know yet. Lets just say rock stars, babies, weddings and broken trust.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Very good. Kept me interested through the whole book. First book by Nicholas Sparks that I've read. Will definitely look into more of his books.  Much better than the movie.
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|This was excellent.  Definitely one you cannot miss in the franchise.  Seriously, I think the best one yet.  I wish this franchise would go on and on for the rest of the careers of these actors.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|First things first, I loved this movie. But I've found out that your opinion on this movie will change based on how much of a trekkie you are. Most are attracted to the Star Trek universe because of the cerebral and based-more-in-reality-than-star-wars feel.<br />So if you are a dyed in the wool, born a trekkie die a trekkie, you may be slightly disappointed (or so i've heard).<br />That being said don't write this movie off. It is entertaining, the script is awesome and the modern actors given the task of living up to the legends do a very good job.<br /><br />For the rest of us who are confused over the controversy you will see a very good movie set in an amazing world with interesting characters. Regardless of your background and experience (or lack of) with Star Trek definitely give this movie a shot. It is well worth it.<br /><br />And as always Amazon delivered a quality product for a good price.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book when the ad showed up on my kindle and I am so glad I did. If I could have stayed home from work to read it straight through I would have. The worst thing about it was the sleep I lost because didn't want to stop reading! Worth the money and more.
0141345659|5.0|I am a huge John Green fan, this is the first book I read by him and I have now read all of the others. He is funny, smart, witty, and even if you aren't a teen, you will love this book. Read anything and everything by John Green, you will laugh, cry, and probably become a better person. Really though, this book is amazing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved all 3 books.  Hope there is a number 4...looking forward to reading more about the Fifty Shades of Grey Family
0425263924|1.0|I really enjoyed the first two books and each led me to invest the top dollar to read the next. Well like many here, who waited for this book and read it within a day of it being available, notice how many are disappointed, not with the writing but the plot. This turned from a trilogy to a series!!! And it turned from good to almost awful in the plot, we cared about Gideon and Eva not the rest of the cast and all the manipulation just to prolong a story.  Who cares about the exes!!!  The family situation should have been wrapped up, just dragging that out.<br /><br />This series is an expensive proposition as well. There are many fine writers on Amazon with prices in series half or less then Ms. Day requires. Well no more I will just assume Eva and Gideon now married lived happily ever after and I can forget buying any more of Ms. Day's offerings.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely different, but captivating.  Could not put them down once I started reading......have read all three!  They certainly hold ones interest.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book is inspiration it give a tragic romance  a new look it was amazing it shows that every relationship is not going to end perfect
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I ride horses and this game is so realistic! The only complaint I have is that it takes a while to load. Besides that, it's great!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is really good and entertaining to watch! I can't wait for season 2 to hit prime for free! The mixture of comedy and suspense is nice
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|Stephen Stills' 4-CD set &#34;Carry On&#34; serves as a great reminder of how talented Stills really is. All of the highlights of his career are showcased here, and much of the lesser known material is given a new forum to be heard. Some reviews have criticized discs 3 and 4 for having too much of his newer, less classic material on them, but some of those songs stand on their own and wouldn't be heard unless they were combined with this set. Any disc that has &#34;Thoroughfare Gap&#34; on it is worth listening to.  While his Springfield mate may have earned better reviews over the years as he switched genres and styles, Stills' best work over the last 20 years holds up well by comparison. Like any compilation, there are always things that you wish were in there. &#34;Manassas&#34; remains the best example of what Gram Parsons referred to as Cosmic American Music, and there are 6 six songs from that album here, but you could have put on more. That said, everyone should own the first &#34;Manassas&#34; album anyway. I've listened to discs 3 and 4 more than I have 1 and 2. Stills didn't stop making good music, some of it just wasn't as popular as the classic stuff.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This story struggled in the beginning but as I continued to read I realized it was the two main characters who were struggling the most with their own needs. The young girl, Asha, adopted from India drew me into their story as she also searched to understand who she is. Her birth mother held her close in a secret place in her heart. I found myself pulled into each of their journeys. You will too!
B000V4NX04|5.0|This really piqued my interest in the history of Germany. A amazing film with a truly special cast. Highly recommended.
B0047CPB1A|5.0|This is a great read, perhaps not quite so good as his later efforts, but still better than most in the genre.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I loved this heart warming story. A man with a purpose - paying back favors makes us all feel good.<br />Plus the wife who came around late in life - smart lady.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Okay movie, a little hokey and slow at times but entertaining enough. Not at all realistic but what movie is these days?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation without knowing what it was about before starting to read it. I loved this book, it has been a long time since a book made me cry.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The content was good but I think the ending was just disappointing. After waiting forever for this book (I do LOVE Gideon and Eva's characters), it left me obviously wanting more. It's exhausting to think about waiting around for yet another book. Honestly, it's been so long since I read the 1st 2 I had to reread them just to remember the storyline. I don't know if I'll buy the next one. I'll probably just borrow it if any of my friends buy it. Sometimes you can ruin a good thing. Not wrapping it up this go around and it's mediocre story was &#34;average&#34; which is not what I'm used to with this writer.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This movie was one of the best horror films I have seen in a long time.  The special effects were great, but what amazed me the most was the acting from the children.  They did such a great job!  What a sad ending though!  I could not wait to see it again after it was over!
B005544V6A|5.0|Love this show! The writer has a great sense of humor and the show is obviously well researched as well. The dynamic inside of a law firm is complicated and they have done a great job of trying to show us its innner workings!
B00899F0G8|5.0|The show just keeps getting better. Hope it lasts longer. Can't get enough. Love the mystery and suspense and the little Alfred Hitchcock tributes thrown in there.
B00499NHLC|5.0|These dramas don't get bogged down in the relationship scenes. The lead character is very engaging and the others support well.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a fun little game I keep on. Losing my friends that I had on there other than that a good game
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I had no idea this book had been made into a movie.  The book was excellent, highly suspenseful.  I read through it rather quickly, staying up much later each evening than planned.  When I recommended it to my husband he told me he had seen the movie, which I quickly rented and watched.  Nothing at all compared to the book.  Great read!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it. The different travel rooms are fun. I like how the callers accents change with the room. Good graphics an fun free daily games
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The character of Jack Reacher is unlike any &#34;hero&#34; I've come across in the myriad novels I've read.  He's somewhat aloof, with a sense of right and wrong, and despite his demeanor, it's impossible not to like him.  You might even find yourself wishing you knew someone like him, someone you might call on to help with difficult situations - if you could locate him!  After reading this first Reacher novel, I'm eagerly looking forward to delving into Die Trying, the 2nd installment.  Spend a few days reading this book - you won't want to put it down!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this channel because it is good to always be able to find the weather report present and future . You are always able to find the weather report all over the country. I would recommend the channel to anyone.It has information as well as maps and pictures to go along with it.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|I haven't used this yet, I've seen it before all over the place and it appears to be something of a 20-questions-esque &#34;mind reader&#34; with a fairly deep character-based library and a bunch of fandom inside-jokes (I've seen this one cover Dark Souls). I clicked to download it while it's free, expecting it to be a fun little toy to mess around with, but when I moved to install it I noticed that its permissions are crazy and, honestly, somewhat frightening. Why does an app that tries to divine answers by having you answer questions need to know phone state and identity, and the ability to delve into on-device accounts, among other things? It just seems unusual and sketchy. Only leaving 2 stars and not 1 because I've seen people have a lot of fun with this, but you'll have to trust that this isn't some kind of security breach.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|It's a very great app it gives you alot of creative options to make you're photos unique and beautiful.You can even fix the old pics taken by other camera apps and turn them into spectacular photos collection.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm actually done with this series.  I was in two minds about it after Reflected in You anyway. But after this turn of events I'm definately done.<br /><br />The series was PROMOTED and promised as a trilogy. All of a sudden it has now been stretched (for no reason other than money) into a five book series.  So now I can't get the HEA I was promised for ANOTHER 2 books and based on how many times the release date for Book 3 was pushed back we're looking at sometime around 2015 before we get the ending of the Gideon and Eva Saga.<br /><br />NO way is Ms. Day getting another US$20 out of my pocket just for the HEA that should have been delivered as promised in Book 3.<br /><br />Is this what they call LEGAL PRICE GOUGING in the US.<br /><br />As for the trite Authors note at the end... it was insulting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game and doesn't get boring to fast because of the changing themes. The gameplay doesn't glitch out much on the kindle. The overall gameplay is great.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but I think Sylvia Day is receiving way too much negative feedback for this book.  Entwined in You is fantastic! I pre-ordered back in August and (im)patiently awaited it's release.  I would have loved to received it much sooner but it was worth the wait.  Book two left me on an emotional roller coaster so I was expecting the same in book three.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gideon and Eva had grown emotionally, pushing the relationship and book to the next level.  I have seen many complaining that Sylvia Day spent too much time on other characters.  I appreciate the fact that those characters are being developed, I can't wait to read more in books four and five.  Gideon is still one of my favorite book characters.<br /><br />The fact that this was going beyond a trilogy was not hidden.  It has been on the web for months.  I can see why people are disappointed that we had to wait so long for book three's release but that does not justify all of the hostility. I hope we don't have to wait so long for the next one.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really enjoy playing. It is cool how they change and sometimes I miss things because I have not played in a while but that's ok I enjoy playing.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Very informative regarding the history of Lincoln as President. Great movie for children to watch as a history lesson.  It's one to watch more than once.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I've tried everything, from Percy Jackson character's to actors,  the creator of Adventure Time and even a &quot;The Voice&quot; contestant, and every time he gets it!! It's insane!! I've become addicted to it only to try to thrawt the genie that knows EvErYtHiNg.
B005USZML4|4.0|Grisham takes me back to my Enid Blyton days. I like the character Theo. What I don't like is the way May is found. A bit too easy although the message of poor parental care is well resonated
0345529057|4.0|I was lured by friends and family to watch HBO's Game of Thrones. I liked what I saw so, I decided to get the Source Material for the series! While, I've been far too busy to sit down and read without interruptions; I have to say that I've been having a hard time to put down the books!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Non-stop reading, suspense filled, with astonishing plot which unravels itself in the Nigerian 419 style. It is a work of art
B00B935SUY|5.0|Mixing in the history of several foundational bands with an explanation of the recording process and the differences between analog and digital recording this rockumentary hits on all cylinders.  As host/director/producer Dave Grohl shows yet another facet of his seemingly unlimited creativity.  Truly a must see for anyone who loves to rock!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is Alison this is my first time playing it and not my last I been seeing everyone playing it I had to find out what it was and I'm glad I did so surf on.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|Jeff Beck never ceases to amaze me with his talent. Playing Les Paul solos is difficult at best but if you close your eyes, you would swear that Les was there in person playing the guitar. With the addition of Imelda May's incredible voice, she channeled the late Mary Ford and even was able to sing with herself double tracked doing harmony! The band was incredible and not only was Les Paul's life celebrated but the electric guitar he so pioneered. Special guests include the legendary Gary US Bonds along with Brian Setzer whose playing was as always amazing (he and Jeff did a guitar duet on Eddie Cochran's classic Twenty Flight Rock). I saw the PBS special first before I bought the disc. Man, what a ride. If you love guitar music, you'll love this CD.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is so addictive but still can't seem to get enough!:) I just keep playing and get perfect in one shot. Easy but not too easy you get bored definitely worth getting just absolutely love it!
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I have a small business and I needed wireless access at one end of the office.  I have a WAP4400N and it doesn't work as nearly as well as this model.  This model works great for the price.  I will probably buy another and replace the 4400.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think why it is awesome is they show u the little story of ice age that is why I like it
B004E2XAHK|5.0|I'd like to say 'why can't all band/groups be like Within Temptation?' but that would make them less special. Where did melodic, hypnotic music go? It's not in the mainstream, and it's never in the charts. In the UK at least the charts seem to be reserved for generic crap with mass-appeal.<br /><br />The track listing on Unforgiving goes everywhere you want it to. The first song is Shot in the Dark, which is a perfect track for cruising along a Pacific coast highway in a convertible Ferrari. That's what it makes me think of anyway. It's melodic and atmospheric with a spiritually liberating guitar solo. The next two tracks In the Middle of the Night and Faster fit with the high speed theme with the extra added punch of determination and new beginnings.<br /><br />The standout track on the CD is Sin&eacute;ad (I'm not keen on songs named after girls as it is massively cliched, but I can let it go considering how good it is) which is now my second favorite song by Within Temptation (What Have You Done will always be first). There is a [[ASIN:B006IZIGBG remix album]] of Sin&eacute;ad. Next up is Lost, a track that very much reminded me of the plot from the movie [[ASIN:B000TAN90E The Invisible]].<br /><br />Almost every track has its own story, and avoids the tired old ways of telling it through lyrics (love, baby, yeah...yeah...yeah!). Within Temptation are actually good (great) at what they do, and don't dumb down their music to appeal sell more albums. Within Temptation are the antidote for One Direction.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app. Is in my top 10 Kindle Apps  , and this is the best Temple Run Ever! I recommend this app
B0094K1WZE|4.0|it continues on the mission impossible series,and leaves it open for more movies from the show to movie adaptation.it has some new characters.
1569242739|5.0|I love this book. Interesting flavors and every recipe has come out great. If you don't want vegan, just replace the soy milk with regular, or whatever! My teen daughter has made many recipes and she really likes it also.
0062238868|4.0|I found the story to be inspirational. I wish more from Chris' wife had been included. I am certain she has a perspective much wider and deeper than what was provided in the book.<br /><br />Truly inspirational and enlightening. I recommend you spend the time reading Chris' account of his life experience serving our great country.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|Didn't realize this was supposed to be a &#34;comedy&#34;...could only take less than 15 minutes of this joke of a &#34;movie&#34;.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great game. No bugs so far. Good for on the go or waiting on service. My son enjoys it. It is good for building concentration skills or just winding down.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Always wanted Sookie to be happy glad it happened.  All the characters were tied up nice and neat in a bow.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I like the actors in this, but something was off in the timing of the plot sequence.  It was a roller coaster to watch.  I was stressed due to the content, but it was ok overall.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved this book much more than the last few.  She really wrapped things up nicely.  The ending made me happy although I will miss the characters of Bon Temps immensely.
142311339X|5.0|My 10 year old nephew LOVED it.  It was the perfect birthday gift for him.  He's looking forward to reading the whole series.
B008JFC6F0|3.0|I liked \\"Innerspeaker\\" OK, and bought \\"Lonerism\\" because of that ... and I like the newer album even more.  BUT:  Musically, there is little here that The Flaming Lips haven't been doing for years - and lyrically, the two bands are in different worlds.  What The Lips have, and Impala does not, is depth (leavened with a nasty sense of humor).  I suppose it comes with time.  So, spend your money on The Flaming Lips' \\"Embryonic,\\" or \\"The Soft Bulletin\\" or \\"Yoshimi,\\" etc.  Or at least check out another band, Panda Bear, and the album \\"Person Pitch.\\"  All these are 5 stars, and that Tame Impala just isn't there yet... or maybe just too tame, for me.
B000EAT246|1.0|I am very disapointed I was already to watch the movie and the disck won't play I've tried it several times and the disc just will not play
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was unnecessary - and spending $9.99 plus tax - in today's times - and there are 2 more books - almost $50 for a storyline - I'm done.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I loved it watching Starsky & Hutch brought back great memories. I love the packinging I love the way the disc look. I'm going to put the box on display.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Michael sings with joy in his heart. If you like the standards, you'll love it. If you are not familiar.....take a listen. His band is extraordinary, and he is wonderful!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Works great on kindle fire. Nice graphics. Take a little to much time to get coins. But that is of course how they make there money.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|It's not my favorite Michael Buble but a venture into a different realm is expected and appreciated. It's worth the price.
B003NS2T9G|2.0|I was so excited when I found this on prime; an exciting sci fi show with dynamic characters set overseas in a place I had actually visited. then all of a sudden it became this romantic story. and what is worse it's a predictable/satirical romantic story. there's even theme music to alert the viewer that, \\"hey, this is going to be the romantic part.\\" I'm just glad I didn't pay for this. so if you like predictable romantic stories with a hint of sci-fi, watch Torchwood.
B00821OX98|5.0|I learned about this series late but it is so good. Good mix of action and scifi. Moon Bloodgood is easy on the eyes too.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|This movie could have been better, it was a middle of the road who done it, without suspense...not the best movie I've seen and not the worst but close
B00005CDNF|5.0|There are great songs on here that I'd never heard. &#34;'I've been waiting for you&#34; just melted my heart. Should have been a single.
B0084TWN9K|2.0|Boring.  Didn't realize her emphasis was Canadian rather than American.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone, particularly because of the price.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|Agnetha has lost nothing except maybe two notes at the top of her range.  This is a good album, but none of the songs touch the quality of Bjorn and Benny's compositions.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This is a very &#34;authentic&#34; film about the true nature and science of making sushi which I experienced on my visits to Japan and the wholesale fish market in Tokyo
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was aware that this was not a trilogy so I knew there would be a soft ending but that didnt effect me in enjoying this book totally! I love Gideon so if there will be 2 more books about him then I am in! I get that it is too long between books, I hope that isnt the case between this book and book 4 and I agree 10 dollars is too much for an ebook but here is a thought...Dont buy it if you cant afford it, if you didnt like the way it ended dont buy the next book, its really simple...its not life or death, its a book. I for one enjoy their story and look forward to book 4.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|I absolutely love this album. It brings back lots of memories and combines great artist with great songs!! John Fogerty genius!!
B004J64QSI|5.0|For quality and spectacle, and to experience the play the way it was meant to be received, this is simply the very best presentation to date! Get it in BluRay if you can. The movie will provide you with perspective, time line, and clarity. But for sheer talent and enjoyment, the 25th Anniversary Presentation is fantastic! The entire cast is phenominal, and Alfie Bow will always bring me to tears with &#34;Bring Him Home&#34;! Just the 500 member chorus is worth the &#34;price of admission&#34;! Don't hesitate!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Great entertainment.  Couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  BUT....as with all Hollywood \\"true stories\\" lots of liberties with the truth without much of a disclaimer.  Just my personal take; too many will believe it's a documentary.
B002BAWIWU|5.0|This is a very comprehensive collection of George Harrison's work.  The sound quality is amazing and I love almost every song on the album. There are 3 live Beatles songs which are not as polished as the originals but are truly a good listen.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It answered my questions and was easy to understand. Helped me in regards on what to do if I have to re-submit my files.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game, love the challenge,and graphics.once you get started its hard to put it down. Definitely can't wait to play the other games.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading about one of our country's brightest and best. This book is not only filled with important information, but it is also inspirational.<br />Charles
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like many other readers, I am extremely disappointed with the latest in the 'trilogy'. This book is a filler and not worth your time or money. I was very excited to continue the journey, but this is where it ends for this reader- I'm disappointed to say it has encouraged me to never read another novel by Sylvia Day.
B008602KQI|3.0|They left out way too many good parts.. Just make the movie longer. The parts I thought were very important, were missing.
0887431453|5.0|This book covers all the skills your preschooler will need to enter Kindergarten.  With colorful and inviting pages, you're child will enjoy &#34;playing school&#34; with this book.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books because the story line was so strong.  This time, the story line is weak and it's hardly worth writing a whole book around it.  Certainly not worth the price or my anticipation waiting for it to be released.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 5 year old neighbor loves to visit and always asks Where's My Perry and enjoys playing with it.  I see it as a valuable tool to help in problem solving and to help him keep from getting so frustrated.  I also like being asked to help and share with him.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|No need for all the pitchforks. If this had been a spectacular Book 3 and the truly last book of the series, readers would be pleading for more books! So I don't have issues with a five book series nor do I feel like I'm being bled dry (don't get me started on how many Evanovich books I've invested in!).<br /><br />I see this book as a &#34;bridge&#34; book--one that's setting up the story for the last two books. Now, I'm not saying bridge books are skilled books--just look at George RR Martin's last one, which was mostly set-up as well. But it is what it is. I'm not quitting the series because of it. And speaking of series ends--hasn't George kept extending his series past the promised number? Again, not a bad thing.<br /><br />I do agree, however, that this book didn't play out much of the promised conflict. But I got Eva's thinking--she's still a wounded bird. And I got Gideon--he's still hugely co-dependent while trying to grow for Eva. So the characters did grow in this installment; however, I wish the promised conflict had reared more of its head in this novel and had directly affected the main characters rather than the secondary characters.<br /><br />All in all, though, a good bridge. Here's to Number Four reclaiming some of the original magic!
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I cannot find the Dolphin Browser on my Kindle even though I have downloaded it and followed all the required steps.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I love it.  This was a very entertaining movie from beginning to end.  My family really enjoyed it and we can watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A compelling look at class structure and how  it separates people from people by the wants of a power class riding on the backs of a poorer class. The blissful ignorance of the general population of the power class is delightfully overstated as to blind US to our own  involvement in it in our own life. Most will identify with our heroine, failing to consciously recognise  that piece of ourselves that resides in the lap of power. Whose back do we ride on?
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After reading the reviews I'm not buying it!!!. Why in the world couldn't she finish the trilogy? Thanks to all the reviewers ! it helped me to make my final decision. Not expending my money and time on this anymore.<br />Sorry for you who bought it!
B00AYXNKIC|4.0|its a great game but level 18 on the beach area is immpossible!!! I cannot make that jump no matter what!!!!! I love the game but the level is just stupid annoying!!
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Would be more interesting if I were 30 years younger. The story line is more of a US type televsion program and lacks any depth
030789701X|5.0|This is an updated review since I recived the guide. It is a must have for anyone who plays or is thinking about playing skyrim or its expansions. Simply by the fact that there is so much you will miss out on, such as the Dark Brotherhood Quests from simply not speaking to that one kid (forgot his name :P). The glossy pages are great; they seem a bit thin but with a book that size they can't really make it much thicker. This guide also helped me pick the right race when I restarted and exponentially increased the potential play time. Great book and for $32 on hardcover there is no better choice!!
B00C27LB20|5.0|The jams speak to me. Jake has a style all his own. Two Fingers what can top \\"kiss the pain away\\". Overall great album. Jake never change your style. GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!
B005F3XV62|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE, SAW IT WITH MY GRANDAUGHTER, HAS A BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE, IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Ok so I read this book in 4 hours. It was dragging in the begining and then at the end it rushed through and ended at a really crappy part. I cannot believe how it stopped. No clifhanger or anything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very disappointed
1588167461|4.0|This book is very very very useful. This book has everything you need to know to be a gentleman. This book is a must read if you want to know the ins and outs of being dapper.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Absolutely hilarious tale told from Drew Evan's point of view about how he went from being a douchebag love 'em & leave 'em playing to a love sick fool who will do just about anything to win back the girl. I loved the witty banter, childish fighting and the oh so steamy sex scenes between Drew & Kate. Could not put it down and I definitely could not stop laughing!
B009X01C64|5.0|Overall, it serves its purpose of keeping the screen protected and offers good protection if you happen to drop your kindle.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|How do you move on from a love that is all consuming?! For Eva & Gideon, you simply can't; these two were meant for each other, there will be no one else for either of them. I can't imagine a world where Gideon & Eva aren't together, their love for one another is just to intense, so all consuming. And while I love the fact that they were able to reconnect and rebuild their relationship together after everything they've been through, I'm a little heart-broken about having to wait until they're able to overcome all the obstacles that keep arising and finally get their HEA once and for all. Not that they didn't get their HEA in Entwined (I'm immensely happy with where Gideon & Eva are in their relationship), it's just that there are still unanswered questions & loose ends that still need to be tied up & I just won't be satisfied until there are no more lingering doubts. Couple that with the fact that I'm not a very patient person, and you'll understand the reason for my heart-break is simply because the wait is going to be torture!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I just downloaded this game about 2 hours ago and have not been able to put it down!  I have only been able to stump it twice!  It actually guessed things like Nancy Reagan, Tommy Kramer, even Ahmed from &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;!  How the heck?  This game has a serious database, but it is really fun!<br /><br />As to the complaint on not being able to &quot;submit&quot; your own answers when you win.....I have a Samsung Epic with a slide keyboard and just used my &quot;enter&quot; key and it worked.  Try using that or similar on your touch keypad.
B000M4RG4C|5.0|This was a great film about the Marine Corps at one of it's hardest fought battles, when they lost 2,000+ men KIA with 20,000 WIA. It was a true grit film. This is not a John Wayne film were all the good guys shoot and kill all the bad guys without getting wounded. It shows what the effects of war have on the men who fight it before, during and after. What they now call PTDS. There were four Marines and one Fleet Marine Corps Medic (known as \\"Doc\\" to all Marines.)<br />I was in another war, Vietnam, and saw the horrific effect it had on the Marines and the Medics who had to respond to the call for \\"Medics.\\"<br />D.R.EVANS USMC 2113468<br />1964-1968 (Vietnam 1967-1968)
B00B0CU2CI|5.0|A well written progressive series of situations which in the end give meaning to the title, Canada, of the book. One could read it twice for a deeper understanding of the author's intent. Most pleasant to listen to if one is unable to read without magnification.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Pre-ordered this book...probably never pre-order again...I do know I won't be spending another penny on Sylvia Day's books.  I feel completely ripped off...even used. 'Hey Sylvia' a trilogy is three not more! Could have at least written an ending...book is not even worth a star...but to leave this review I had no other choice.
B00CBKXGPI|2.0|Sorry, I just plain do not like it. I found it very boring. I Only played it for a little while. I don't like the buying and selling. Would prefer to hunt down art thieves. that's what I thought it was about. This game drags for me due to all the auction house action going on.
B009R659L8|4.0|MH Clark is a good writer.  I thought the book was slow in the middle, but had a good ending.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I have watched the first 2 TV series and then found out there is a series of books so I decided to read them and I am loving the books just as much. Recommended reading.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|This is a lot of fun and the kids are really enjoying it; I'm hearing new cackles and gasps of amazement every few minutes. The first one I did stumped him a bit but it only took him three guesses to figure it out in the end. The second one took hardly any time at all. I don't know how the developers did it but it's worth it.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Still loving the series. Can't wait to read the next book before I watch series 3. If you have loved the first book I have no doubt that love affair will continue. All I want to do is read more.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I absolutely love Gideon and Eva. I was still on a high from Reflected in You, but Entwined with You, I fell flat. A book that I should have read in under 5 hours, took me most of the day because I kept losing interest. I felt that Entwined with You was drawn out. I believe a lot of the fluff could have been cut out, because it seemed added in as there were several typos that should have really been caught by editing. I didn't get the emotional roller coaster of a ride that I got in RIY. I liked it, but I didn't love it and I didn't feel that connection to the characters like I did in the first two books. I felt that Gideon put everything his is and has on the line for Eva, but felt like she begrudgingly accepts it. Key word ACCEPTS here....<br /><br />There is a lot of drama in this book with A LOT of unanswered questions. The ending to RIY completely has changed Eva and you can feel the change in her in this book. She comes across almost cold. I still love her, but she needs to take a step back and I think she realizes that, thanks to Cary. Oh Em Gee, don't get me started on Cary. He needs to be throttled.<br /><br />There are wedding plans in the works and wedding bells in this book! And a surprise OOPS! And I have mentioned drama?!?! Yes, Brett is in this book... Along Monica, Victor (Eva's dad), and Gideon's family. And all I could think throughout this book is poor Gideon. He needs so much love. There are so many people that need a good bitch slap in this book.<br /><br />Entwined with You, left me more pissed off about how the characters reacted to situations they were in, than I am about it being broken up in five books now. (Which I am thinking might be one book too many.) The ending of this book is not a complete cliff hanger, but left for so much more to be desired. It's looking like we will be hitting the West Coast in Book 4. And there should be a LOT more drama to follow.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Great flick.  My wife and I have see Iron Man 1 and 2. Now I need to see Iron Man 3.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book!  I couldn't put the book down and dove right into the final one once I loaded onto my Kindle.  Completely hooked!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I got this book as a loan from a friend but I didn't really start until two days ago.  I've been putting it off because I thought it would be too dark and twisted for me to handle.  Yes, it was dark and emotional, however, I also loved it especially Dean Holder.  Oh my, where could I get a boyfriend like him? he's awesome, sweet, kind, loyal and hot too.  Both Sky and Dean overcame so much issues in their life.  When you think it couldn't possibly get any worse and it did.  Sky is very lucky to have Dean as he loves her unconditionally.  I normally don't like to read books like this one... too much angst, issues, too emotional.. too much of everything but I am glad I gave it a shot.  Colleen is a wonderful writer. This is the first time I read her book and it won't be the last.  I am already a fan and can't wait for her next one.
B001FB55H6|5.0|One of the best super-heroes movie done. Excellent special effects and scenario, beautiful image... some poetry here ! This long version doesn't exist in Europe !
1589795474|5.0|I bought this book hoping that it would help get my family pointed in the right direction financially.  My family never really struggled with our finances, but wanted to make sure that we were doing what was needed to make sure we were doing everything we could.  One of the important lessons was to sacrifice a little.  Put silly notions like granite counter top's and $50,000 luxury cars out of our mind and be more practical, and in just 6 months applying the lessons we learned we were able to accelerate our mortgage and pay more toward principal each month and to save a little more than we were.  The book is not telling you to give up the life you lead, but to instead make smarter choices.  Given how the economy has changed so much over the past 5 years, we can't count on raises or even job security anymore so we have been using lessons of this book so that if hard times do fall upon us we will be equipped to ride it out.
B00BQ1DATU|5.0|This album is amazing from beginning to end! Highly recommend if you are a fan of The National, Bon Iver or similar artists. You will not be sorry!
B005URRCNQ|5.0|While the rest of the world is out downloading digital music, I love vinyl, and I love this band, its so much better than mp3 or CD.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I had trouble the first time I downloaded it. But the second time it was perfect. As long as I had an internet connection. Nice graphics and relaxing. I have to admit it was for my son. But I have been playing for 3the days and he still doesnt know about it. Oops.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I sometimes believe that people do things for money.. This author is drawing out this series by two more books for what...Money.......  she could have ended it here and wrote a new series.. We all loved the first 2 books.. i am unsure if i will buy the next 2 books. i was hoping to see them overcome there obstacles and be together but no... we have an ending that leaves you hanging. Also stories about people we could careless about... but i will be returning this book.... i waited for this book for what........ Sad
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I've waited for this book for forever, so when I opened it on my iPad this morning, I was thrilled. Now at10pm, not so much anymore. I was hoping for a grand conclusion, and find myself waiting again.<br /><br />The book is okay, no where near as good as the two before it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book has a great but heartbreaking storyline that will keep you engaged until the end. Augustus is a wonderful character who is witty and very kind even through his difficult days with cancer. A great quick read with a great lesson.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Well written with good themes.  This is cleanly written without the current modern interpretations that cloud or even distract the reader.  I do like the classics without the sex and bad language.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|The best way to describe this application and its functionality with current and older HP printers is...&#34;What we've got here is failure to communicate!&#34;
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book takes the reader in awe from first to last word, The mother shows incredible stamina and creativity in teaching her son, even as they must live amidst abominable circumstances. Very well-written and excellent character development brings you through a journey you're glad you didn't miss!

B00BEXB18M|4.0|\\"But it's not Rust in Peace\\"......no, it's not. If you want to listen to Rust in Peace, there's nothing stopping you. This is Super Collider, Megadeth's 14th  studio album. This time, the band  injects more Hard rock into the mix. Not much Thrash in this one (but there's plenty of that in their older albums.) Not as much Heavy handed metal. ( Again....plenty of that from their prior cd's.) But lots of jamming, catchy Hard Rock stuff.  I won't say this is the best written or produced  album, because it's not.  I found that, in places, lyrics repeated a bit too much and I would have liked to have seen longer solo's.....but That stuff is just personal nitpicking. I LOVED the last 3 albums and I really like this one. Not every song mind you. But there are certainly more cool songs than not on Super Collider. I bought the special edition with 3 extra tracks on it and the awesome 3-d cover, and while the 3 extra tracks didn't add anything to it, they certainly didn't take anything away either. I'm happy with what they did on this.To my ears,  Money well spent.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game for me and my kids! I haven't had any issues on my kindle fire. I really like that they are learning as they play.
0767802470|5.0|I have lost count how many times my young son and I have watched this outstanding film.  The set is superb; the action exciting; and the story true to the time.  Whilst this is a screenplay, it sums up the fortunes of many German sailors who were simply serving their country in war, albeit for the murderous Nazi regime.  It shows the hardships of serving on a U Boat for weeks on end confined with others in damp, cramped conditions. After reading many books about U Boat operations I can thoroughly recommend this film.  There are so many exciting, humorous and saddening stories still left to depict.  J'attendrai the sequel.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|He loved it.  Had been to see a performance and desired to have his own to hum along.  Mission accomplished.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The pictures aren't great, and it is a little convoluted trying to focus the picture because there is no sight to the camera.  You point the Kindle away from you and hope that you get what you are trying to photograph.  It reminded me of the old box cameras that you had to look down into to take a photo.  I might just need some practice, but it works when you play with it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This is my first book review. I typically read several books per week, and pay attention to reviews before buying. Unfortunately, pre-ordered this book because I wanted to get to the HAE for the much-enjoyed previous two books in what was billed as a trilogy. I trusted Sylvia Day to deliver as expected. As we now know, there are more books to come, which at least explains why she loaded up &#34;Entwined&#34; with random subplots, lingering on fringe characters with no significant advance in plot or character development. This book is merely a set up to try to justify stringing out two more books.<br /><br />Thanks to the reviewer who gave the refund instructions! I'm getting my money back -and out of the hands of a shameless author and publishing house. Too bad I can't get a refund on the hours I wasted reading this garbage.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|A very humorous book about growing up poor, Irish and Irish Catholic. Frank makes a very funny story about his poor, poverty poor, childhood.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I love Earth Wind and Fire, so it was good way to purchase some of their hits.  Although there were a couple of songs that were not included that i was definetly looking forward to hearing.<br /><br />Still a good buy.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I laughed, I cried.  For me, the beginning was pure poetry. A beautiful story that touched my heart and soul.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I wanted months for the Book and it was truly a good book 3 to me I don't care what any one else says all the sex made the book even better ...however I am angry and frustrated with Sylvia Day for doing another book like it's so stupid the reviews are very low due to this she need  to listen to her fans more , I do know this  that next book better be the last and in Gideon POV or I am done with DAY altogether....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a wonderful story, could not put it down. Can't wait to read the next story, Losing Hope. She is a great writer, truly loved the Slammed series also.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|So I started the book last night and it was slow getting going. Of course right when it gets good it ends. Wish these authors would stop writing 3+ books but I'm ready to know what happens.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The Quick & Dirty: Sookie is back in the 13th installment of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Series. The stakes are high in Dead Ever After: all of Sookie's old enemies are back...and they want her D-E-A-D. The biggest problem? With Eric tied up in vampire politics Sookie is left without her usual supernatural guard.<br /><br />The Good: I feel that a believable character arc is essential in any good story. Harris has succeeded in taking Sookie from a wide-eyed, good Christian, Southern girl to a wary, battle-worn, killer...who tries to be a good Christian. Sookie's voice has evolved in a very believable way. Who wouldn't become a little desensitized to the idea of murder after they've been beaten, bitten, stabbed, shot, and tortured.<br /><br />Harris also does her best to bring closure to all of her characters' stories. Jason, Tara, Sam, Andy Bellefleur, Arlene, Alcide, Pam and many others make an appearance and some have better endings than others.<br /><br />The Bad: I'm sure I'm not the only fan of this series to notice that Harris has been getting bored with her characters. After the ninth book I had hoped that she would cut the cord, but she just kept dragging it out. Since this was to be the last book in the series I thought she would go out with a bang. Suffice it to say that this was far from reality.<br /><br />Dead Ever After is one long wrap-up. The majority of the story centers around Sookie's everyday, mundane, activities (as has been the case for the last few books). When Sookie isn't cleaning the house, catching some rays, or brushing her hair she is either bumping into a friend who has an update about their life or she is trying to figure out who wants to snuff her (and even then most of the sleuthing work is done by the team of friends who have come to help her out rather than by Sookie herself).<br /><br />One of the biggest problems in the book was Harris' ill-made decision to switch perspectives. The change is jarring and makes for a somewhat disjointed story.<br />The Final Word: The ending to Sookie's tale is long overdue. If you are already a fan of the series you will, of course, have to see it to the end. Don't expect much and don't be surprised if you are disappointed. I think this was just Harris' way of giving her readers some type of closure.<br /><br />On a brighter note: who's ready for the next season of True Blood (June 16)?<br /><br />www.ChristyWrites.com

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This is one of the best QOTSA , I was surprised at how full and creative this one sounded. Now this is not a heavy hitter like Songs for the deaf, but it's certainly more textured and full and you can shake your booty to it. \\"If I had a tail\\" is a great one lyrics and all.<br /><br />I really like the new drummer (Mars Volta, A Day As a Lion), the mood, and the overall feel of this, buy it and you'll be happy you did, totally worth the money. Can't wait to see these guys this summer do it live.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I had just got a new clever phone that can do amazing things so I thought I would try it out by downloading a book to read on it. I found that Pollyanna Grows up was one of the free options so I thought &#34;Hey, why not?&#34;<br /><br />You know, as I re-read a childhood classic I was reminded that our life often throws us the curved ball and we feel that everything is against us, but if we just DO A POLLYANNA and start looking for the GLAD things, we will be totally amazed at how good life really is.<br /><br />It was a real wake up call to me. I am so GLAD that I got to read Pollyanna again.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Kez Frances
0802473156|5.0|I give this book to couples I counsel for marriage. I have done so for many years. It is good for couples at any stage of their marriage, even though I use it mostly for newly-weds and engaged couples. I would recommend its simple formula and follow up with couples on how they are implementing their principles.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I'd been shooting with available light for years, since I never liked the results with the built-in flash. One can learn a lot of things from this exercise, but finally giving in and buying a flash really changed my life. I haven't compared this one to the cheaper brands, but to me, it feels solid and it just works. I considered buying the SB-400, but in retrospect, I'm glad I spent the extra money on the SB-700. Sometimes, the ceiling isn't the best place to bounce the light, and you need the flexibility to bounce it somewhere else. The included filters have been very helpful as well.
1932100660|5.0|This will change your life and, if you follow it, will prolong your life.  It is an easily understood study of how diet and lifestyle  effects many diseases that are crippling our world.

It is an undisputable, logical approach to our health and will interest anyone who wants to live a long, disease free life!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a wonderful app, but it is really hard. I am really, really good at temple run, which is similar, but I die in about two seconds on this game. I would highly recommend this app to ages 8+, but not to younger. Great App.
B00003CXRM|5.0|this is my husband's favorite movie....so glad Amazon has dvds so easily attainable at great prices.  Strongly recommend for anyone to watch....well, not small children because there is some language.
1423140591|5.0|I finished the book in 3 days.  Very well written book.  I bought the whole series so you can save some money.
B007NZQU72|4.0|This is one of those books that as you're reading it suddenly people and experiences in your life are drawn into new focus and make more sense. This is excellent for developing understanding and avoiding conflict with certain people in your life.
B004R6JG7G|4.0|Obviously this is a classic Tom Cruise film that still has a mass following.  My only complaint is the display isn't as great as I hoped it would be.  I expected better quality for Bluray.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|It's a nice time waster for a couple of hours.  It missed the first 4 out of 5 times; the only one it got was Motoko Kusanagi. Akinator doesn't seem to be very good at conceding defeat, however.  I couldn't understand why, after he guessed wrong at the end of 25 questions, I'd get a \\"continue\\" option.<br /><br />Just to see what would happen, I played some more and tried \\"continue.\\"  On one fictional character, it went up to 70 questions, and he still got it wrong. Nothing much changed - there was still no \\"congrats on stumping me.\\"  I tried again with a couple more anime characters (Atsuko Urameshi & Ein, both of which he got).  Akinator does seem to have extensive anime knowledge.<br /><br />I wondered how he would do with real people.  He was clueless for the first two (historical American women).  He did know Imhotep, the ancient Egyptian architect, but once again, he failed on another famous historical woman.<br /><br />He's really good at patting himself on the back when he gets it right, but he doesn't reciprocate.  It kind of takes the joy out of stumping him.<br /><br />EDIT:  many reviews have mentioned the web version of the game, so I checked it out. Using one of the previous persons I'd stumped him with on my Kindle (\\"New Yorker\\" columnist Lois Long), I played through the web version.  After some 80 questions comprising 2 or 3 continues, two \\"enter your person\\" forms, two \\"select from the list\\" forms, and a final form to \\"enter your person\\" with a line of description, I FINALLY got a congrats.  Hardly seemed worth it at that point.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Just watched this.  It is a great movie. Full of the usual fast action and car crashes. Great fun to watch.
B00CL50KDY|1.0|I didn't even finished, bad, really boring. I like horror and zombie movies, even when I knew this wasn't the same concept I was expecting to be more exiting, they had a great idea, making the zombies humans again. Didn't make it work.
B0045D3N3O|5.0|Consider this film was not selected for an oscar that year but corny (same) Jim Crow era Driving Miss Daisy was.  Now if you are searching films, did Driving Miss Daisy ever come to mind you think my I have to see that movie, does it have any redeeming qualities?  The answer lets you know this movie was snubbed. As 25 years later it commands a heft retail price and an anniversary edition.This one is beautifully colored but chronicles pivotal moments in his life.  The directors out takes also add valuable insight into not only the making of this masterpiece but also, Malcolm X's life. It will make the unfamiliar want to learn more about this dynamic genius whose potential almost could have never been realized. And offers a bonus little documentary to start you off if you desire more about the life of this giant.<br /><br />Spike of course takes the creative liberty to insert himself into the film, he's funny but not a real actor, as was customary for him at this time of his film making.  Skip what you heard about his life if you never delved into it,  this film shows you the kind of metamorphosis intellectually and socially that many men could go through if some in society weren't so fearful and hateful.  Much could be learned.  A must for All families with young hearty males but particularly young males who may be getting erronious labels because of their differences from what mainstream deams is acceptable in a young being..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read.  You have to read all 3 to understand the whole story.  Well worth the read, but I was not seeing the movie.

0782008372|4.0|I liked this addition of the Highlander story because it filled in a lot of blanks with the additional footage.  It tells more of the Background and how the secretary knows the highlander’s story…  I just did not like the audio.  Anyway, I had this a long time ago and the misses made me get rid of it due to multiple military moves.  Now I am settled down and can own it again….
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This trend for multiple books is one I've come to despise and just seems like a huge money grab for these authors. At the very least, don't be dishonest and say that it's a trilogy and then just keep dragging it on because it's too profitable not to.  There appears to be a backlash against Ms. Day for this based on the number of very negative reviews.  I'm with all of the other reviewers.  And the stupid comment by Ms. Day at the end of the book just pissed me off. It seemed just as thought out as this bone headed story line.  So much in this book was just stupid.  The whole Brett thing was beyond explanation.  Let's see.  You have a man like Gideon that is an Adonis, wealthy beyond belief, treats you like a queen, and well, let's see....KILLED FOR YOU.  Seriously???? What kind of moron behaves the way she did and.. OK, Brett I'll go to your concert, and I'll invite you in, and GAGGGGGGGG. Especially after what she did in book 2 and how Gideon reacted. You ruined her Ms. Day.  You took one of the best couples I have ever read about and ruined them by turning her into a MORON.  Unfortunately, this is just as common as this new multi book trend.  And by common, I mean authors ruining beloved characters by trying to continue stories beyond where they should have been continued.  JUST FOR THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!  Shame on you Ms. Day.  Welcome to the world of ordinary and not extraordinary.

B00CL68BK2|5.0|I think it was a great movie.  I'm not a critic, but it met my expectations, which were admittedly high from other reviews.
B001UGB1X8|1.0|I actually bought this movie on Ebay for $2 so I could let a friend borrow it.  In the words of Jeff Bridges as Barney Cousins \\"you will have to experience what she experienced\\" I wanted my friend to experience how bad it was... Problem was my friend actually liked Electric Mist.  I'll tell you it's just... so straight to DVD and Junior Varsity in quality, and I think the editor was whistling on a hammock because nothing makes sense. It's as if someone threw all the scenes up in the air and they just landed where they may on a huge low budget wigi board.  If I was the director I would have yelled \\"cut\\" this movie is awful before the release. Watch it if you enjoy bad movies.  Pretty sure our old pal Tommy Lee was taking the pay on this one if you know what I mean. Do actors know a movie is going to be awful while filming?  Of course they do.

B005PK57IK|4.0|This is one if the best legal dramas on right now. Rarely descends into soapdom, consistently well-cast, often well-shot, always better lit. Some episodes work better than others (the penultimate episode had one storyline too many), but you don't succeed by staying safe.

His insights on giver, takers and matchers provide evidence that givers have an emotional intelligent edge in leadership, teamwork and getting things done. He even has a Don't Be A Doormat test so that takers are identified before they disrupt projects, companies or relationships. I would highly recommend this book!

0307474275|5.0|This novel opens with a parable told by a father to his son, about<br />another father who is forced to give up his young son to a monster, a<br />div.  When the father later confronts the div and discovers that his son<br /> has been well taken care of and is leading a happy life, the div asks<br />the father to make a choice: take his son home or leave him to his happy<br /> life.  Realizing that to take his son would fill the void in his own<br />heart but ruin his son's life, he leaves the son.  Recognizing the<br />father's selflessness, the div rewards him by erasing the memory of his<br />son.  Despite this \\"gift,\\" the father is left his a hole in his soul<br />that is never filled.<br /><br />This opening parable is reflected in the<br />rest of the interconnected stories in this novel, all of which involve,<br />to some degree, characters presented with the same choice. Although the<br />main narrative involves the bond between a brother and sister, this<br />novel is actually much broader in scope than a story of siblings.  The<br />common thread, in my mind, is the effect of breaking a bond between two<br />family members or close friends.  When these bonds are broken, often<br />voluntarily and for the good of one of the pair and the detriment of the<br /> other, the characters are forced to view the world in a new light.  As<br />young Abdullah notes shortly before losing his sister, he \\"felt the true<br /> vastness of the desert, and the world, for the the first time.  How<br />easily a person could lose his way in it.\\"<br /><br />Of course, every<br />broken bond leaves a hole in the lives of the characters, ones they<br />attempt to fill, often with other people.  As one mother explains, she<br />needs her daughter to \\"fill these holes inside me.\\"  Some succeed in<br />filling these voids, while others are left with gaping holes that will<br />never be filled.<br /><br />Regardless of the overarching themes, this is an<br /> emotionally moving novel written by a master of crafting stories of<br />relationships between people that we all can relate to.  Hosseini often<br />comes close to treading into overwrought sentimentality that, in the<br />hands of a lesser author, would turn me off.  Hosseini is saved by his<br />remarkable ability to create characters and relationships that do not<br />seem contrived.  I am not ashamed to admit that I teared up during parts<br /> of this novel, which, in my eyes, is a sign that it was written by a<br />masterful storyteller.<br /><br />Hosseini is never restrained as he weaves<br />several stories into a tapestry that is cohesive both in theme and in<br />space.  Each story is somehow connected to the others, although the<br />characters themselves are often unaware.  Like his other novels, this<br />one focuses mainly on Afghanistan, but Hosseini spans the globe, placing<br /> parts of the story in California, Paris, and Greece.<br /><br />When The<br />Kite Runner was published, not long after 9/11 and the invasion of<br />Afghanistan, many Americans had little knowledge of the people that<br />lived there.  Hosseini has excelled as introducing these people and<br />their heartbreak to a general Western audience, humanizing the people<br />that are eyewitnesses of the most recent war and the atrocious Taliban<br />control that proceeded it.  Now, as our involvement in Afghanistan<br />begins to wind down, this novel shows, in some ways, the effect of our<br />involvement in the country.  This is not a novel about the war in<br />Afghanistan. Many of the conflicts created in its stories, however, are<br />in some way the result of the general upheaval caused by the many wars<br />in that country.  If nothing else, Hosseini's novels reflect the fate of<br /> Afghans in the last century: being caught as a cultural crossroads that<br /> often results in a mashing of people, some of whom are flung to the far<br /> corners of the world.  One can only hope that the coming years bring a<br />peace and prosperity to Afghanistan that allows the heart-wrenching<br />dramas that populate Hosseini's novels to dissipate.rs bring a<br />peace and prosperity to Afghanistan that allows the heart-wrenching<br />dramas that populate Hosseini's novels to dissipate.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|This movie impressed me so very much,that I tracked down the short story it is based on. You may love the movie, the characters, music, storyline, mood, photography, and directing as much as I and other friends and family do, but you do not have an obligation to buy into the ending of the director's cut. The director made that choice.<br />Buy this film. Use it for discussions of the many ideas expressed, enjoy it, be saddened by it, be moved deeply by its messages. All the while, remember, while the director is talented and gifted in many ways, his alternative ending isn't The True One, or the 'right' one; his alternative ending is HIS interpretation. It isn't even the one the author wrote.<br />All of us have the freedom and obligation to use our imaginations, make interpretations, and utilize the subjects raised in a movie, book, or short story. We all are ENCOURAGED to CONTEMPLATE all these important matters, discuss, debate, hash out, these ideas in order to nurture each other, cultivate our own growth, gain insight, and form a world view. Thus, we are individuals.<br />Blade Runner is one hell of a World View!

If you like romance, heartache, bitter emotional struggles and a male lead you would fall head over heels in love with, then this is the book for you.<br />I was impressed with the characters and how relatable they were, especially Holden. I thought the storyline was interesting and kept you involved all the way through. I especially loved the scene where Sky and Holden bump into each other when she goes out running. Their fights and interactions at the beginning were very funny.<br />I loved the flashbacks and how they slotted in perfectly throughout the story.<br />I'm very excited to read the next book after finishing this one. A brilliant book.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|When I received my ARC in the mail I was so excited to read this. I been waiting a long time to finally getting back with Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />I left a good book I was in the middle of reading to start this. I feel I should have waited. Eva and Gideon talking more about their relationship instead of always having sex was nice. But it was always going back to the same conversations over and over. I felt they needed to re insured their self's so much through out the book it was killing it for me.<br /><br />Then it was slow. OMG it as so slow. I was getting tired of reading it after 30% and it didn't pick up from there. Not really, yeah there was a couple of surprises but nothing that is going to get me jumping up and reading my eyes out to finish.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book so much! I really did. I am not sure what is going on with these added characters. I can give two f bombs about them, I just don't get why they were in the book so damn much.<br /><br />I am just confused to where else is this going to take us. The book should have just stopped in the last book with a HEA. Taking me through this whole process of non scene.. I'm not sure where else this book can take you.<br /><br />The sex was hot as always but with being bored in this book I was tired of reading even those parts.<br /><br />Sorry loves, don't hate me cause I didn't like this so much. Just didn't cut it for me.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|The dialogue, the plot, the skilled subtlety of the writing - they all make for a terrifically enjoyable read  Highly recommended.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Excellent film-to-digital transfer for the DVDs---good, clean image, even on my Blu-Ray player.  I never tired of seeing Peter Falk do his Columbo thing.  I didn't get into the series until very late in its first run on network television, so it's been great seeing a lot of the older episodes for the first time.  The series was produced during a time when Universal was cranking out a lot of TV series and it wasn't unusual for you to recognize one of their sound stage sets used over and over in multiple TV series.  \\"Columbo\\" however, used a lot of real California locations for their plots---you'll see some spectacular mansions and villas.  And, if you're a motorhead, you'll get a charge out of seeing lots of huge old luxury automobiles from the '70's. Some of the greatest guest murderers are Robert Culp, Ray Milland, and Patrick McGoohan.  Buy it!  You'll love it!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have been impatiently waiting and waiting for this book because this was when we were to get Gideon's story. So when the release date shifted from December 2012 to May and then to June I put a timer countdown on my iphone for this book's release because I was so excited.  And now I'm not sure I even care anymore what happens next. Sure, I read the book all in one day - but I kept hoping it would get good like the first two books were - a real story, character development, the works. And so now I have finished the book, I realize that all this book did was make me hate Eva. In RIY we saw some maturity in her character. Here, I just rolled my eyes and wanted Gideon to kick her to the curb.<br /><br />It kills me to write this but what I was hoping in a nicely packaged trilogy is now a drawn out 5-parter where all I feel is \\"eh. whatever.\\"
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I watched all of these episodes as s kid.  I am re-watching them now and they are just as fascinating.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This is an excellent album, Tom!  Well worth the decade we've been waiting for it.  I was a huge fan of Cinderella, so I can appreciate the evolution and maturity that's apparent in this group of songs.  There's more sophistication here than even the best Cinderella material, and you chose great studio musicians.  It's so refreshing to hear an album of REAL ROCK INSTRUMENTATION again after suffering through so much crap on the radio these days.  Also, there's a bit of a vintage Rod Stewart feel to some of these songs!  Which is not a bad thing, but I never knew you had it in you, Tom!  Keep it up.  I'll fall short of calling this Tom's \\"masterpiece\\", because I hope that record's still coming in the future...
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Really wish season 3 would come out, this show is amazing and the writing is crazy, so in depth so interesting
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh, Gideon!  Yes I am in love again!  This story just gets better and better.  I can see why the talk is that she needs two more books to finish this story.  If the next books are this good, I say just write faster!!!  We cannot wait another six months for the next book please!<br /><br />Teaser:  What will happen with Brett???  What will happen with Corinne? Who did what to Nathan?  ...and will Cary ever learn to keep it in his pants???
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am so shocked that this book that I had been waiting for was such a \\"let down\\".  I totally agree that this has not been the writing that has driven me to read her books in one day. It is very clear to me that Syivia has a ploy, was distracted, in a hurry or just does not care to keep her readers interested.  I agree with the initial lengthy feedback by \\"pfinalcountdown\\".  Instead of continuing to develop and complete the main characters, Sylvia instead appeared to place uninteresting fillers into the story that angered me and frankly speaking were complete \\"turn offs\\". Eva should be more mature now, Gideon should be so frustrated with her that he truly leaves her until she understands what she has in him. The other characters are really not that important! So, so disappointed!

B0041KKYGU|4.0|The fact that this movie did $100K at the box office speaks for itself.  Cameron Diaz gives a 5-star performance and is really hot in this movie.  This is one of the few films in which the photo on the cover is actually taken from a scene in the movie.  Kathryn is outstanding in her supporting role as Cameron's nemesis.  The reason why I am giving this only 4 out of 5 stars is because it's supposed to be the &#34;Unrated Edition&#34;.  The DVD actually contains both the theatrical and unrated versions for you to compare and there is not much more in the unrated version.  Also, the additional scenes are PG-rated stuff.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am glad I am not the only one disappointed with this book! I waited hopelessly for this book to come out, trying to find other books to fill the void that this series left. I can't even begin to explain how let down I feel about this! I wanted my \\"happy ending\\" for Gideon and Eva. Paying $30 was enough and more than I ever spend but no way I am paying $50 for a series that could have been tied up in this book. It was so full of fluff I could hardly read it. I LOVED this series up until now!

B000W94FE6|5.0|I happened upon while researching users interface design. Although the book touches on elements of design that are important, it is not about that at all. Flow could be seen as a religious experience, hedonistic self-indulgence, or the answer to all of our problems. It is a state of being that helps bring meaning to our lives. Flow does not occur without a goal, a challenge, involvement, skill, learning and growth. Flow changes us. And this is a good thing. Whatever you do, what ever you believe, you have likely experienced flow at some point. The good news is that you can experience it again - this time on purpose. Csikszentmihalyi slowly, carefully and clearly explains what this experience is and how to get it. This is not a religious text, but it could be seen as one. The most important part of this book for me was recognition that many of our current religions have strayed too far from their original path and may no longer provide us with the things we need. The same can be said for science (arguably another religion).<br /><br />If this review makes any sense to you, I recommend you read the book. If not, look elsewhere.

1885167776|5.0|I read The ONE Thing several days before going into the Grand Canyon for a 5-day solo retreat and took with me a slight variation on the question posed in the book: What is the one thing that, if accomplished, would facilitate every other goal that we have at Values Coach?  On the flight to Arizona I wrote out what I thought would be my answer in a journal (it had to do with creating new teaching materials around our core course on personal values).  But after living with the question for those 5 days, I came out of The Canyon with a completely different answer - and it is an answer that has gained unanimous support of the rest of the crew.  What made the question so powerful was the way in which it forced me to think in terms of priorities - not \\"either / or\\" but \\"what one thing comes first.\\"  With that, it became clear that achieving critical mass with another product that had been one of several priorities would make everything else a whole lot easier - and with that, it becomes a whole lot easier to make the commitment to saying \\"not yet\\" to those other priorities.<br /><br />Another strength of the book is the persuasive argument they make for blocking off a significant chunk of time each day to work on that ONE Thing priority.  As someone with RBADD (Really Bad!) I've read lots of books and articles on focus, several of which the authors quote, but this is the most compelling and practical discussion of the topic that I have seen.  And since I am on the road almost every week for at least part of the week, the challenge of blocking off four hours a day for this ONE Thing means some serious rethinking of our business model and my personal life and work choices.<br /><br />One caution: the authors show how this question to identify the ONE Thing can be used in multiple dimensions of your life - professional, financial, family, spiritual, etc.  But trying to identify ONE thing in each of those realms at once runs the risk of creating the exact lack of focus that the book is designed to help you overcome.  So while it's a useful question in each of those life domains, it would be wise to choose just one to start with and prove to yourself that it works.<br /><br />I give the book 5 stars because it is well researched and well written and makes a unique contribution to a crowded field.  If I can follow through on the simple but by no means easy prescription I have given myself as a result of reading it, I will come back a year from now and petition Amazon to allow me to upgrade my review to 10 stars.the book is designed to help you overcome.

B006QV30JU|5.0|I considered giving this a 4, but how can you do that to Gene Kelly? Not the masterpiece that Singing in the Rain or An American in Paris were, but still a very solid, entertaining movie. Some of the most astounding backdrop painting I've seen in a movie, and an understated but unforgettable performance by Barry Jones in the role of Mr. Lundie. Beautiful cinematography in the scenes where Brigadoon appears from and disappears into the Highland mists. I've loved this one since I was a kid, and while plots have gotten better since then, the wit and energy in this movie still shine.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Just finished reading and am actually really disappointed. I felt like the ending came out of nowhere with no kind of closure and that the story really didn't progress any, aside from one major event. I thought this was the conclusion of the series and am discouraged that it isn't. I am now worried that the series is going to be dragged on  when it shouldn't be in order to profit from the 50 shades feel of it.  I honestly don't see the need for this book. Everything in it could have been included (and shortened) in a book that would wrap the story up.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Hooked on this show! Season 2 is just as good as 1, unlike some shows which just fizzle out after a great first season. With this show, that is not a problem. Pay attention, this show is intense and there are a lot of interweaving storylines.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Hubby just had to have a 3D TV and as we build up our collection of 3D movies, this is a great addition.  Unlike some movies where 3D is an afterthought, this movie was created with 3D so the images are great and feel natural.  And it's the Hobbit-- Doesn't get any better than that for appealing to your nerdy nature.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed the story and the premise that the future of the human race can be saved. The one problem is that the inclusion of the Warsaw Pact is out of date. It might have been better if the book was updated to replace the middle eastern states as a bloc of nations that wanted to attack the Western and European countries.

0425263991|5.0|Heart of Obsidian by Nalini Singh<br />Paranormal Romance -June 4th, 2013<br />4 ½ stars<br /><br />Nalini Singh's latest Psy-Changeling novel is better than ever.<br /><br />Silence has ruled the powerful Psy.  It is the only thing that keeps them from becoming mentally unstable.  But now it is collapsing and the extremists working for Pure Psy want to cause further mayhem.<br /><br />The only Psy strong enough to save their race is the coldly beautiful, Councilor Kaleb Krychek.  But many distrust him and feel he only wants power for himself.  Can the calculated and manipulative Psy be a true savior or does he have ulterior motives?<br /><br />When Kaleb saves an unstable Psy named Sahara, his motivations become all the more complex.  Who is Sahara?  And what abilities does she have that she was abducted for years and kept as a prisoner?  As Kaleb tries to rehabilitate her their past is revealed but will Sahara forgive him and help him when she discovers he is the reason she was tortured?!<br /><br />Loved this book!  Kaleb has always been a dark mystery.  Is he good or bad?  He certainly has his own game.  He is playing by his own rules and everyone else in the book is scrambling to keep up!  I liked that although the author shows his `human' side he is definitely extraordinary and the emotions she reveals only make him all the more fascinating and charismatic.  The heroine is also an enigma.  Sahara is an important puzzle in his life and trying to figure out how she fits in kept this reader turning the pages and staying up into the early morning.  The romance between Kaleb and Sahara is electrifying especially since the Psy are not supposed to have any emotions.  So when their emotions pour out are they intense and almost obsessive.  In fact, the passionate intensity of their love was one of the most moving that I have read in a long time.  Sahara has secrets of her own and her unusually bright and warm, spirit is a soothing balm for the merciless Kaleb.  As they battle to deal with Psy extremists and fight to keep their race sane this book comes to a spectacular climax which will gratify readers of this series...when the truth is unveiled.<br /><br />This explosive book reveals a stunning hero, a courageous heroine and the fate of a race killing itself.  Do not miss it!!<br /><br />Reviewed by Steph from the Bookaholics Romance Book Club
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My wife and I love &#34;Castle,&#34; and it was fun to see how Castle and Beckett related to each other in the early episodes. We had also forgotten how they looked in the first season. We laughed at both of their classic facial expressions. We enjoy the humor that is interspersed throughout, and we would highly recommend this DVD, even to those who have never seen the show.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|I too was apprehensive about the NEW Rigoletto when I heard it was updated into the Las Vegas Rat Pack theme, but I was delighted to see this performance at the MET and enjoyed the production and singing immensely.<br /><br />I understand the protests of opera purists, we've gone through many changes at the Met and in opera and it's not like \\"Back in the days\\". I prefer to be open minded, some I have liked, some not, but folks, it's a new age.<br /><br />Having not seen the HD performance OR the Great Performances I still bought the HD DVD. I think it is great that DG released it so soon. The clarity of viewing is superb and the singing just as fine as when I saw it live. I'm glad to have it in my collection.<br /><br />So excited about this Rigoletto and that I have it on my subscription for the Met next season with Dmitri Hovorostovsky as Rigoletto!

The love that is expelled is through the deepest trust, the extensive sexual encounters and sensitivity.  I can not wait for the next installment.  Altough their lives are consumed with tragedy and the unthinkable the 2 of them learn to live with it and except it.  Learning the live with abuse and the demons is a great feat and all should learn to strive above it and conquer it.

B000QCS8TW|2.0|A Game of Thrones is the first book of Martin's Song of Fire and Ice, an ambitious, epic fantasy series that, like the Tolkien novels that inspired it, tells a sweeping tale of good vs. evil, of how seemingly powerless people can tenaciously battle and win against even the most malicious enemies.<br /><br />The main character is a writer named George R. R. Martin. He's a well-meaning author, capable of telling a tightly wound, suspenseful story with characters that readers love. But he eventually finds that he must protect and defend his beloved story against the forces of a nameless, faceless enemy who we know exists but never see: The Editor.<br /><br />Slowly and methodically the tension builds. Book by book. Thousand pages by thousand pages. Martin bravely and lovingly defends all 527 characters from the knife of The Editor. He desperately protects them with walls hewn of superfluous paragraphs, meandering chapters and meaningless exposition. Each time we see the Editor get close to paring the novels down and restraining the brave author, Martin fights back. Martin will stop at nothing to defeat The Editor. If the Editor likes a character, Martin doesn't hesitate to ruin him or her. If the Editor hates a character, Martin deploys it with abandon. If The Editor has no idea who a character is, Martin adds twenty more just like him, just to cleverly cover his tracks. Martin inspires us with the way he will never give up his struggle to save Westeros from The Editor. Ever.<br /><br />This exciting pursuit pulls the reader into a world where nothing is what it seems. Where gripping stories are shockingly transformed into mealy quagmires. Where the people who seem to matter, don't; and where the people who don't seem to matter, also don't. Where just when you think the author is going to give you some brand new, never before read turn of phrase, he whips out one he's used 27 times before. Where a full 10% of the words you see on a page are the names of characters, and a full 80% of chapters involve nothing happening to those characters. Where space-time wyrmholes make it possible to describe the most important battle in the war in 5 pages but a 6-person walk across a prairie lasts for 3 entire books.<br /><br />The story will continue in books 6 and 7. No one yet knows how (or if) it will end. But if the first 5 books, it will be an incredible, astounding achievement like nothing that has come before it. Like a bowl of oatmeal the size of Kentucky. Or a car with 800 wheels. Truly, a one-of-a-kind achievement.a full 80% of chapters involve nothing happening to those characters.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have been waiting impatiently for the final episode of Gideon and Eva's story. Imagining how it would play out after she learned at the end of book 2 that he had killed someone in order to protect her. This book is disappointing, really not what I expected from Sylvia Day. There is no real plot and the ending is so anti-climactic, there is no finality to their story. Then I see the note from the author saying that their story is not over, I only hope that the next book is better and does not cost $9.99, because this was definitely not worth the money.
B000HX4ZF6|1.0|Why they even bothered to pretend this had anything to do with the period described in this movie is a mystery.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Excellent movie, I read the book first and was very glad to see that the violence she went through in the book was not in the movie.
B005NQ94KS|5.0|Although this movie did not get any recommendation by the pundits, is a wonderful story about relationships.  Jim Sturges, who plays the main character, is amazing in every one of the changing roles he plays, whether stoned, hurt, loving and so on.  He really should<br />get more recognition for his acting abilities.  Anne Hathaway was wonderful opposite him.  I watched the movie several times on TV then bought it  to have.  I recommend it highly to anyone who believes in love.
B005BV0BA2|5.0|Still one of the most powerful, elegant releases around, and definitely one of their best.  Awesome compositions and atmosphere, with memorable songs that nobody else could have pulled off.  One of my first metal albums right after it came out, and still finds itself in rotation to this day.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|the only reason i gave this a 4 star is because of a couple places that I thought were disturbing for younger viewers...ie, when a heart gets wripped out of a dead mans chest and a man gets eaten by a huge bug. It wasn't really bad but if you protect you children in what they watch and shelter them in that way, that might be disturbing. It bothered me just a little. I had sat down to watch a kids show with my kids but I just thought some things weren't kid appropriate.
B0064MGU98|5.0|fantastic first season, wonderful characters, smartly written, got me addicted. love the cast led by juliana margulies, it's like my new law & order, i hope it has as long of a run
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Dance In The Rain is the best song compared to the garbage that is the majority of the album. Kingmaker is okay(despite the Children of the Grave melody in the vocals of the verses). Blackest Crow is decent. Beginning of Sorrow is okay and the first 56 seconds of Dont Turn Your Back is great with the blues intro & riffs. Then come the lyrics that are so corny that it ruins the rest of the song. There's﻿ riffs on songs that seem out of place, most of the lyrics are god awful & the choruses are too repetitive in every song. Ever since Johnny K has been in the picture that's been the case. Chorus after chorus. Thankfully this will be Johnny K's last produced Lp for Megadeth
B005MLOOJA|5.0|writing still smart and keeps you engaged, fantastic guest appearances this season especially Michael J. Fox and love more of Alan Cumming
1554072840|5.0|I used the boys version of this book for my 2 youngest sons while they were potty training.  I changed the boy's name to their name (ie Scotty's Potty or Kanon's Potty)  and they loved that.  It helped me greatly.... And they are now 30 and 23!  lol  This book is so good and has been around for so long... I bought it for my granddaughter, Lily.  Now it is Lily's Potty!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good read if you like zombies ,was a little hard to follow at times but worth the time to read
0425263924|2.0|I was unhappy when the release date for this one was changed not once, but twice. BUT, even I can get over that for the love of a good book. This wasn't it. The plot line was THIN, I mean RAZOR thin, most of the book felt like \\"filler\\" pages. Sylvia Day also seems to be taking the Dickens' approach to writing which is why say something in 3 words, when you can say it in 15. I loved that Eva and Gideon's relationship has grown and the level of drama between the 2 of them at least, had simmered down. But overall, I'm left wondering why I loved this series so much in the beginning, and I'm really hoping this series hasn't \\"jumped the shark.\\" I have to say that I'm in agreement with some of the lower ratings, this book just wasn't all that. It did feel very watered down and when she could have answered questions or expanded on plot, she wrote towards the mundane.... Eva went to work, Eva went home, Gideon is hot, Gideon has ghosts... we get it. I'm not even going to address the \\"nonending\\" of this book. I think that topic has been broached enough, but yeah, it didn't help at all when paired with everything else.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|Had a hard time during first 1/2 hour but then all in, hook, line and sinker! Very theatrical without the singing! Acting was outstanding!
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Picked this up for my homebound 88 yr old mother. She loves movies and is a big Harrison ford fan. This is a great bargain. She raved about it!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Interesting book.  Have read it many times. I would definitely recommend this book.  I didn't predict the ending at all.
B000XUHVY0|5.0|This is a great deubut for After Forever, and it's hard to believe that Mark Jansen and Floor Jansen both started here. You can hear the beginnings of Epica's symphonic styling, and Floor's amazing vocal range. Been listening to it a lot since I got it.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This movie never gets old. It's the quintessential modern fairytale. Super fun for adults and children. Plus it's remastered so it looks very good.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I don't see the big deal I defeated it twice out of the first three times I played (once after 59 questions... what happened to just 20?).
B002HLM4E0|5.0|They did a really good job putting this movie together and I would definitely recommend watching it. However, I am reading the books and watching the movies as I finish each book and I would recommend doing that as well because the books have so much detail that can't be fit into a 2 hour movie.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|Not much different  from Brainium's original FreeCell except you pay for this one.  In fact, no different at all, except for the 99 cents.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Great adventure drama vision and concept. picks up where Stearate left off. But stands alone as a great series.<br /><br />Hour  Netflix will bring it back.  Robin may be hard to bring back since he seems to be very busy.  As are many of the former cast but hourly they can make it work.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Some repeats in the prose but overall it was very good. Can't wait for the next one to be released.
B00007KQKM|5.0|Liked the movie. Some hot adult scenes. Picturization is good. Some may find difficulty with British accents. Was a multi part BBC mini-series.
1439156816|5.0|Enormously practical and hilarious! I am going to make it required reading for my English 111 students in the fall.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great app. It is worth the 2.00. You can customize the color of the battery icon. Nice.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sylvia why???<br />Why would you take a perfect story line and make such a mess of the story!  I am really getting tired of how \\"you authors\\" are taking books that are suppose to be \\"a trilogy\\" and turning them into a H.M. ward book that goes on and on and on selling each for a price that ends up costing us customers $30.00+ it is RIDICULOUS! I am so upset that I am refusing to contribute to a few of you authors pockets anymore.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Suspenseful and exciting. great story that was actually true.  The casting was very good.  Colorful scenes of local country very concise.  Great movie!
B0001IMC8Y|1.0|The movie was a DVD  format that is for non-USA markets.<br />I'm going to have to return it.<br />Not happy.
B00CS7ZXFK|5.0|If your a Beach Boys fan, you should have this CD. The group sound better than ever. I've been a fan since 1962, and have almost all of their recordings, and if this is a farewell CD, it's a great way to go out. I only wish they could patch up their differences, because I think they still have some great music left in them. I'd recommend this CD to anyone who likes great harmonies and great arrangements. This is a classic!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing settings within the book. It kept me turning pages without realizing the time spent.  I loved how each book kept the emotions and character feelings alive!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter loves this game and plays it often. It is one of her favorite apps for my Kindle Fire.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|I found myself working too hard following the multiple plot lines and keeping up with the jumps between them to have an enjoyable night watching a movie.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The original novels had humor and a certain earthiness.  Since the HBO series has become popular, the stories appear to be marking time, waiting for the TV show to catch up.  The characters haven't changed or grown since the first few books; they are merely repeating the same old songs in different locations.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I got premium for this app for free the day before I got this, so to me, this app is terrible.  Even if I didn't, the premium's cost is worth being if you have the extra money.  Feel free to use this as a test run, but premium is a lot better.
B000RVK1AQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Lots of action and cool effects. It is one I enjoy watcing over and over.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was looking forward to this book but very disappointed! There is to much drama and not enough spicy romance or dialoge. The ending will just make you even madder because it is not over yet! I feel like I am running in circles with this series and it was one of my favorite until Entwined with You came out.  I wish I had loved this third book but I didn't and I'm ready for this series to end!
B00845PT18|1.0|I did not enjoy this movie at all. I am thankful I didn't waste money in the the theater on this one. I enjoyed the original a lot and still enjoy watching it. This one, I'll never watch again. I almost didn't see it to the end because I didn't enjoy it all.
0307878937|4.0|I loved how every flower has a meaning and how the characters used flowers to express an emotion when they might not be able to express it otherwise.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Jack Reacher is big and tall and rugged. Clint Walker like...<br />The story is good and the movie entertaining. Overall, I liked it.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Very good connection. Will watch then all.Have know of the Dr for years. He has some really good helpers too.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I learned some things about that period that I never knew before, especially about the 13th amendment.<br />All of the acting was well-done.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|This book was funny, a quick read. I would recommend it.i have enjoyed most other books by this same author.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Every song is great! My two favorite songs are ones that I didn't purchase the album for. Overall very happy with this buy.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|We enjoyed this movie.  Tom Cruise did a good job of the lead, even though the book character is over 6' and 200 lbs.  Plenty of action and excitement.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this app, for free, just as an afterthought and partly because of the other reviews that I read. I found it to be very helpful, in that my youngest daughter uses my kindle fire hd a lot and sometimes forget to check how much charge there's left. This app not only alerts her to know that the device needs to be recharged but also to the life left on various other programs. This is most helpful particularly when we are on the road, for this allows her to switch to another program that would use the remaining life of the battery more efficiently. I had no problems loading this app and it works beautifully.  I am seriously considering purchasing the paid app.
B003Z6XSUK|5.0|Great movie, great acting, great story! Students enjoyed it. Many students don't realize the struggle African Americans faced at that time.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|Louisa Alcott, a trusted author, does not disappoint in this classic collection of books.  I am thrilled to have this to read over and over again.  The price was perfect.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was engrossed from the first page...and left with my jaw on the floor on the last!  I can't wait for the next book I hate cliffhangers!  You won't be disappointed if you enjoyed the other two books unless you hate to wait for the conclusion!
B009J2VQSK|4.0|It was a fine mix of new and old music which fit the movie perfectly. I could recommend it to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final book of the Hunger Games was spectacular!  The twists and turns were to die for!  My only regret is that I've finished reading it.  In fact, I actually read the last 20 pages or so twice!
B009CPGZFS|4.0|Simon Baker is too cute for words. As Patrick Jane he never fails to captivate with that boyish smile, cunning instinct, and quick wit. The supporting cast is good, I especially enjoy Cho...would like to see his character played up more.  Some of the episodes are better than others, and yet it is a good show that keeps me coming back for more.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have appears been very vocal about the quality and charm of the Quell series, and Memento is definitely worthy of the name. It is charming and intelligent, and there seems to be a lot more hidden secrets this time (which is good, as the puzzles themselves seem easier than in the original two, especially Reflect). Overall, an easy perfect score, due to the quality of work that Fallen Tree puts into all their products!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|So, I am a sucker for a good romance book with a bit of suspense thrown in and Finding Pride was just that. Beautifully flawed characters, that I couldn't help but root for, were guided by an interesting story that kept my attention from beginning to end. Jill Sanders has a knack for telling a wonderful romantic story and I look forward to reading her other books.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|It was first class, really enjoyed it. acting was great, scenes were excellent sound was good. great story, well documented
0425263924|1.0|This was terrible, what a waste of money.<br /><br />The story line is just far too thin, the dramas felt forced, the characters were unlikeable. I really enjoyed the first book in this series, the second wasn't bad and I was looking forward to this book, which turned out to be ... filler.<br /><br />I can't get over how unpleasant these characters are, I think I liked them in the beginning too! At this point I don't want Eva and Gideon to be happy because she is a spoilt, selfish brat like her mother and he is just MEH ... not realistic, not likeable. Might as well just be a giant inflatable penis with problems. They are not characters I can get behind. Cary has become equally unpleasant. I was skipping the sex scenes because they were just boring and repetitive, the whole thing is boring and repetitive. There was not enough plot for this one book, let alone another two.<br /><br />The ending was sudden and unsatisfying offering no pay off for the reader.<br /><br />This is a blatant money grab and it's just disrespectful to readers Ms Day, to wait seven months promising the end of the series and using that to get people interested in the book and then serving up dull filler. I won't be bothering with the next two books, I don't like it when authors get greedy at the expense of their readers and integrity.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|This intense thriller series starts with setting up the journey for Jesse Stone. It is interesting to see the reaction of the arrival of the new officer to the small town and its reaction to the change.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is great fun. It's got cool trance music and nice upgrades. It reminds me of Gradius mixing in with Asteroid. I definitely recommend this game to Gradius and Asteroid fans.
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|It has a heavy plot. It is interesting and not boring at all. You would like this if you like mysteries.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was not Ms. Harris' best work, but I don't care.  Loved the whole Sookie Stackhouse series and I'm sad it has ended.
B000GOWNPU|3.0|Movie is violent and some scenes are hard to watch.  Child abuse by juvenile detention guards is intense.  Storyline is good though.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|What can I say: this movie had action, comedy, a decent plot, and great acting. If you are looking for a sweet zombie movie that is not too sweet for a man to watch, then look no further because this is the film for you.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|I use this with the x-grip to hold up my cellphone while i ride my bicycle.  the only problem i have with it the nuts are rather close to the base of the unit making it hard almost near impossible to get a socket on it to tighten it down. you'll need to use a crescent wrench and there will be a good chance your going to scratch  up the base unit.
B009GENZ12|4.0|The movie's trailer and packaging gives off the impression that this is a horror movie, but it is not; it is suspense. I like the message that the movie is sending out because it does make you think. Also, Jessica Biel did a terrific job with her acting in this role. I really can't type too much because I would then be giving away the movie.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's not like we haven't heard of it.  Word prediction is top notch, customization is next to none...multiple layouts and options on button placement..get it.
1906735875|5.0|First off this Volume is Gigantic...it's as thick as a large Phonebook (For those of you who remember what that is) It's full of short 4-8 page Judge Dredd Stories so it's Very Action Packed throughout, it's not one BIG Volume of One story Arc that just goes on and on...Even though if they're quality like &#34;Watchmen&#34; or &#34;V for Vendetta&#34; that works too...The fact it's all in Black and White didn't bother me one bit, the art work is good throughout When Brian Bolland is at the helm which is quite a few times throughout the volume the Art is Amazing, (I'm a huge fan of Bolland ever since Batman &#34;The Killing Joke&#34;...Over all unlike with some big volume collections (Savage Sword of Conan) it all makes sense and DOES make sense Chronologically which is Great because SSOC being all over the place made it confusing to read...I'm about to move on to Volume 2, and for as big of books as these are, I'm not sick of it nor do I want to take a break from it before starting #2, and I think that in itself shows the entertainment value of this collection!
0525478817|5.0|I could not wait for this book to make it's way to paperback, so I was psyched to see it for an affordable price. It arrived on time so I am very pleased!<br />Thank you!
0345803507|5.0|The best of the series. More developement of the charactures
B00A81NFAS|2.0|Based on the magnitude of favorable reviews, I purchased Silver Linings Playbook and found that it didn't measure up to the hype.  I didn't think that either of the lead characters were sympathetic or likable although I do like the actors who played them.  I conclude that it was a fault either of the writing or of the directing.  Tellingly, I found the most interesting and attractive character in the film was the alienated soon-to-be-EX-Wife!  And, yes, this is certainly a minority opinion, but they cannot imply that this work is &#34;universally loved&#34;.
B000KOZMUE|5.0|Great little flash. It has bounce capability, and is pretty powerful for it's size, and a bargain to boot. This one is a keeper.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I can't even get to the right place to download this file. The instructions do not match your website. So I can't even review it properly. Big bummer if you need something in a hurry and there's no one to help you immediately.
B00358ESI4|5.0|The telling of the experience of the IaDrang valley battle was not an easy thing to achieve.  I feel the author, producer / director plus Mel Gibson have given the public a chance to visualize how chaotic and frightening combat is.  The entertainment value of the film is there but the authentic history value seems to rule!  As a learning tool to help anyone learn what Vietnam was like, the movie excels.  One needs to understand and accept that combat cannot be learned only experienced!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|This game is terrible! I can't even open it! I try clicking on it but it just says for me to purchase the full version. Hate it. Don't waste your time guys. This is not even a one star game. More like zero never star game. I only put one star because it told me to rate this game. :c :c :c
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|Just one of the great original horror movies,the first one was the best! The creature was very well done( CREEPY)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book is written very well a good story and it is easy to read on two levels. My wife who is ESL was able to read this book without much delay which is rare. Also, the story is so well told so the book is easy to read in the sense that you don't get tired of reading it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this show. While the X-files-type encounters are not believable, the stories and this band of characters keep me drawn into their adventures. The cast's quirkiness and comedic timing often has me laughing out loud!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I love this show to pieces and I just to have the DVDs. Thankyou for providing it to Pll lovers like me .
0140564349|5.0|This is a classic children's book that makes a wonderful gift for an older brother or sister who has just been blessed with a younger sibling.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Literally everything about this is garbage. It's boring and cliche and nothing like a Die Hard movie should be. The first one is my favorite movie and the other 3 are all great, I just hated this one though. Don't waste your time watching it, complete s***.
B00ANY94A0|5.0|My daughter loves the Lego Friends line and this was a nice small addition to the sets.  She enjoys playing pretend with the animals.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|In the last few years only a few comedies have been funnier than this movie. I recommend buying it and I know you will not regret the decision. This is not the best comedy ever made by far but extremely unique and entertaining.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I would also recommend this dvd series to any true star trek fans that want to relieve childhood memories. Great job.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games they provide you with are spectacular and give each other a well rounded balance. This gaming app is a good way to puzzle the mind.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I loved this movie as it put a bow on the 2 year series. Summer Glau does 'strange' pretty good and to see what 'her purpose' was, was satisfying. It also had an actor who played the 'good-bad guy' who was driven by his principles but yet was having internal emotional turmoil. Good action and a cap on all the actors and actresses who've most have gone onto other successful shows.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a really good app , if you have to depend on an alarm to get you up in the morning... i advise you get this<br />fmoi: @_randiii
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing creative idea for a movie great ages 8&9. Perfectly done. The bad guys could be a little scary for little ones
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love everything about it. If I drop my kindle I know that it won't break with this case on. It has a little sleeve that holds the whole thing together, which I think is great, and it stands up by itself when I'm doing other things. So I recommend this case to any of you who are reading my review.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Twisted - had to read to the end!<br />Also enjoyed Gone Girl Gone - another pretzel.  I want<br />more books from this author.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, so we got it for her birthday.we will enjoy this one!<br />It is the best Karate Kid movie of all time!<br />Thanks,<br />JUNIE
B005LAIHE0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. If you enjoyed &#34;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&#34;, give this one a try. It's not quite as good but definitely entertaining.
B003L20IHE|5.0|Good stories, like these are the kind you don't mind your kid watching. no cursing, viloence etc (there's enough of that in the real world).
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David Bowie sounds like he is channeling all his earlier influences on this great recording. This CD is very accessible and pop-oriented without sacrificing any of Bowie's artistic integrity. There are touches of his 70s, 80s, 90s, and beyond work that are beautifully crafted. My favorites are If You Can See Me, Dancing Out in Space, and How Does the Grass Grow? If you are a new or long-time fan of Bowie, this is a must have!!
